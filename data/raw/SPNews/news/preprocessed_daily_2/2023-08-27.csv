1,5837dbd6-5bbf-3ede-ba0a-3a186b171420,TXN,2023-08-27,Returns On Capital At Texas Instruments (NASDAQ:TXN) Paint A Concerning Picture,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/returns-capital-texas-instruments-nasdaq-120033503.html,1693137633,STORY,['TXN'],"[Did you know there are some financial metrics that can provide clues of a potential multi-bagger? Firstly, we'd want to identify a growing return on capital employed (ROCE) and then alongside that, an ever-increasing base of capital employed. Basically this means that a company has profitable initiatives that it can continue to reinvest in, which is a trait of a compounding machine. Having said that, while the ROCE is currently high for Texas Instruments (NASDAQ:TXN), we aren't jumping out of our chairs because returns are decreasing.Understanding Return On Capital Employed (ROCE)Just to clarify if you're unsure, ROCE is a metric for evaluating how much pre-tax income (in percentage terms) a company earns on the capital invested in its business. The formula for this calculation on Texas Instruments is:Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)0.30 = US$8.6b ÷ (US$31b - US$2.7b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to June 2023).Therefore, Texas Instruments has an ROCE of 30%. In absolute terms that's a great return and it's even better than the Semiconductor industry average of 12%. View our latest analysis for Texas Instruments roceIn the above chart we have measured Texas Instruments' prior ROCE against its prior performance, but the future is arguably more important. If you're interested, you can view the analysts predictions in our free report on analyst forecasts for the company.The Trend Of ROCEIn terms of Texas Instruments' historical ROCE movements, the trend isn't fantastic. To be more specific, while the ROCE is still high, it's fallen from 39% where it was five years ago. Meanwhile, the business is utilizing more capital but this hasn't moved the needle much in terms of sales in the past 12 months, so this could reflect longer term investments. It may take some time before the company starts to see any change in earnings from these investments.Story continuesThe Key TakeawayTo conclude, we've found that Texas Instruments is reinvesting in the business, but returns have been falling. Since the stock has gained an impressive 71% over the last five years, investors must think there's better things to come. However, unless these underlying trends turn more positive, we wouldn't get our hopes up too high.One more thing: We've identified   2 warning signs  with Texas Instruments (at least 1 which is a bit concerning)  , and understanding these would certainly be useful.If you want to search for more stocks that have been earning high returns, check out this free list of stocks with solid balance sheets that are also earning high returns on equity.Have feedback on this article?

Now, as the industry’s valuation multiples start plateauing from previously lofty levels, many hidden gem chipmakers seem primed for their time in the sun.While headline grabbers like Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) soaked up much of the attention during the AI craze, more underappreciated players in the space offer intriguing value now. The rising tide of digitization, AI, automotive electronics, and the metaverse mania will provide a tide that should lift many boats in the semiconductors space over the long haul. Investors just need to look beyond the shiny objects to find the most discounted tickets for that ride. Here are three.ACM Research (ACMR)a magnifying glass enlarges the ACM logo on a websiteSource: Pavel Kapysh / Shutterstock.comFlying under the radar as a provider of specialized wafer cleaning tools to the semiconductor industry, China-based ACM Research (NASDAQ:ACMR) looks poised to ride powerful geopolitical trends accelerating domestic chip production, in my opinion.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsACM Research posted record Q2 2023 revenue growth of almost 39% year-over-year, driven by strong demand trends in mature node investments within China. Management called out the substantial gap between China’s domestic mature node capacity and actual semiconductor consumption, which creates solid tailwinds for equipment suppliers like ACMR that have significant exposure there.Additionally, ACMR is making strides with international expansion, having delivered its first evaluation tool order received from a major European semiconductor manufacturer last quarter. While regulatory risks associated with U.S.-China relations exist, I believe ACMR’s differentiated proprietary technology across wafer cleaning, electroplating, furnaces, and other areas gives it a strong, sustainable competitive edge both in China and abroad.Story continuesTrading at just around 10.6-times forward earnings, ACMR stock presents sizable upside potential if execution continues, especially given the favorable industry trends. The average analyst price target of $25.80 for this stock implies a massive upside potential of 91.4% from current levels.Intel Corporation (INTC)Close up of Intel sign at their San Jose campus in Silicon ValleySource: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.comLeft behind during the pandemic bull market, Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) now trades at a bargain level compared to the broader semiconductor sector average. Over the past decade, Intel slowly lost process leadership to Taiwan SemiconductorManufacturing Company (NYSE:TSM) as manufacturing challenges mounted. However, under new leadership, Intel’s bold turnaround strategy aims to reorganize the current hierarchy of process technology companies, with Intel in the lead by 2025. It even had its CPU business under threat by AMD (NASDAQ:AMD), but thankfully, the company has started a turnaround here, too, with the company gaining market share.Additionally, recent boosts to Intel’s foundry ambitions make me very bullish on its prospects. The announcements that Boeing (NYSE:BA) and Northrop Grumman (NYSE:NOC) are joining Intel’s Department of Defense program to develop next-generation chips domestically are huge. Furthermore, the CHIPS Act providing $52.7 billion of funding to bolster semiconductor manufacturing in the U.S. will likely support Intel’s ambitious plans to build new cutting-edge fabs stateside. In Q2 2023, Intel’s foundry revenue already grew over 300% versus last year, showing promising early traction.Despite the near-term economic demand uncertainty, Intel reiterated its full-year 2023 guidance on its latest earnings call, signaling confidence in its ability to execute the product roadmap. The company expects to launch its Intel 20A node in 2024, which promises major performance and efficiency gains.With its beaten-down valuation and progress toward achieving both IDM 2.0 leadership and foundry business growth, Intel deserves greater investor attention. Analyst price targets suggest as much as 87% upside from current levels, though the average target has been dragged down by a lowball $17 price target by Rosenblatt Securities.Qorvo (QRVO)a cell phone withSource: ShutterstockAs a leading radio frequency (RF) solution supplier, Qorvo (NASDAQ:QRVO) serves diverse end markets like defense, internet-of-things (IoT), automotive, and smartphones. Despite macroeconomic uncertainty, Qorvo’s recent design wins across radar, auto, and defense applications provide a solid base of business, in my view.The company also looks well-positioned to me in higher growth segments like Wi-Fi 7, IoT connectivity, and silicon carbide power devices. Qorvo’s recent multi-million-dollar order for its silicon carbide chips shows its strong positioning to enable more efficient AI servers and data centers. Its Matter 1.1 smart home certification also significantly expanded its serviceable addressable market among top smart home ecosystem players, a segment I’m very bullish on.Although Qorvo’s Q1 FY2024 results showed declines versus last year amid inventory adjustments across the supply chain, management expects demand recovery in the second half of 2023. Qorvo’s very strong cash balance of $744 million and reasonable debt load of $2 billion provide stability amidst market volatility. And given its leading market share in RF solutions, exposure to diverse secular growth drivers, and reasonable valuation around 20-times forward price-earnings ration, QRVO looks poised for upside in my view. The average analyst price target of $113.64 represents a modest 14% upside potential from current levels. It may not seem like a lot, but it is a far cry from the downside risk that most semiconductor stocks currently face.On the date of publication, Omor Ibne Ehsan did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

If you want to skip our detailed discussion about the healthcare industry, head directly to Ken Fisher’s Top 5 Healthcare Stock Picks.The healthcare sector was forever changed by the COVID-19 pandemic. While it highlighted the weaknesses in the global medical supply chains, the medical industry exhibited tremendous commitment and resilience in its pursuit to fight the global pandemic. This has since led to the need for sustainability and innovation throughout the industry. The global healthcare industry was effective in treating the pandemic with its mRNA vaccines. However, the demand for these vaccines has naturally declined since then. According to Precedence Research, the global biotech industry was valued at $1.2 trillion in 2022 and is expected to grow roughly 12% per annum over the next 7 years, reaching $3.2 trillion by 2030. While the healthcare industry foresees normalization this year to pre-pandemic levels, Deloitte expects the United States spending in the sector to increase up to $12 trillion by 2040. With the global focus on artificial intelligence, numerous biotech companies are exploring applications in workforce and patient management. Similarly, the technological advancements in medical equipment for minimally invasive procedures has a positive impact on patient recovery, through smaller incisions that are less damaging to muscle and tissue. BlackRock reported that it forecasts the minimally invasive market to be valued at $76 billion by 2027. Moreover, drug development also presents a promising future. With over 55 million Alzheimer’s patients, a new antibody treatment slowed the rate of cognitive decline by 27%. As these studies and clinical trials continue, the pharmaceutical industry is poised for more research, development, and innovation. Don't Miss: Billionaire Ken Fisher and Corporate Insiders Are Betting On These StocksWhile on the correct path, the industry still faces a number of challenges. According to Deloitte, the first major challenge has been the digital transformation in the healthcare sector. The pandemic presented an opportunity for low-cost and safe remote interactions. However, this also showcased the need for virtual health records and data management, through cloud-based solutions. In addition to electronic health records, the adoption of telemedicine can improve the organizational efficiency and cater to the labor shortages that the industry has lately experienced. Moreover, the global healthcare industry will need over 80 million additional workers by 2030. This has further stressed upon the need for ‘hospitals from home’. LBMC, a professional services CPA firm, reported that the global market for telehealth was valued in excess of $48 billion in 2022 and it is expected to grow over $57 billion in 2023. To supplement telehealth, there is a growing need for healthcare devices for remote monitoring, such as health bands. Story continuesAlso Read: Ken Fisher’s Top 15 Energy Stock PicksKen Fisher of Fisher Asset Management is one of the leading investment analysts in the world, with a net worth in excess of $6.8 billion. Last year, when the S&amp;P 500 was down by 18%, Fisher predicted the market would rise after the midterm elections. According to Fisher, since 1925, the fourth quarter for every time a midterm election has been held, the stock market has delivered positive results 83% of the time. For 2023, he expects the market to be led by “high quality mega-tech” stocks. Fisher explained that after the midterm election, investor confidence grows and the market is less risk-averse. He further explained that historically, the later half of the year, although less profitable than the first half of the year, continues to perform better than the normal market. While normally stocks rise 60%-70% of the time, in the midterm election year, stocks have reflected a 92% increase, historically. As inflation slowly declines and the US economy grows gradually, Fisher expects the market to remain positive, heading into 2024.In this article, we discuss some of Ken Fisher’s top stock picks in the healthcare sector including Merck &amp; Co., Inc. (NYSE:MRK), Intuitive Surgical, Inc. (NASDAQ:ISRG), and Eli Lilly and Company (NYSE:LLY).Our Methodology We used Fisher Asset Management’s Q2 2023 portfolio and selected the 15 biggest positions in healthcare firms during the quarter for this list. We have mentioned Fisher Asset Management’s stake value and the hedge fund sentiment towards each stock as of the second quarter of 2023. The list is ranked in the ascending order of the firm’s stake value in each holding. Ken Fisher's Top 15 Healthcare Stock PicksKen Fisher of Fisher Asset ManagementKen Fisher's Top Healthcare Stock Picks15. Medtronic plc (NYSE:MDT)Fisher Asset Management's Stake Value: $287,604,000Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 63Medtronic plc (NYSE:MDT) is a biotechnology company that focuses on the research, development, manufacture, and commercialization of medical devices. Focused on the  cardiovascular segment, the company also offers software solutions for remote monitoring. On August 17, Medtronic plc (NYSE:MDT) declared a quarterly dividend per share of $0.69. The dividend is payable on October 13 to shareholders on record as of September 22. At the end of Q2 2023, Fisher Asset Management held 3.2 million shares of Medtronic plc (NYSE:MDT) worth $287.6 million.According to Insider Monkey’s second quarter database, 63 hedge funds were bullish on Medtronic plc (NYSE:MDT), in contrast to 52 funds from the previous quarter. Jean-Marie Eveillard’s First Eagle Investment Management is the largest shareholder in the company, with 5.5 million shares worth $484.2 million. Like Merck &amp; Co., Inc. (NYSE:MRK), Intuitive Surgical, Inc. (NASDAQ:ISRG), and Eli Lilly and Company (NYSE:LLY), Medtronic plc (NYSE:MDT) is one of the top healthcare stock picks of Ken Fisher.Appleseed Fund said this about Medtronic plc (NYSE:MDT) in its Q1 2023 investor letter:“During the most recent quarter, Appleseed Fund added three new equity holdings: Medtronic plc (NYSE:MDT), Stanley Black &amp; Decker (SWK), and Synovus Financial (SNV). Medtronic is the world’s largest device manufacturer, and it holds the number one or number two market share in most of its product segments. Medtronic’s business is heavily weighted towards complicated in-patient procedures, which are typically quite profitable. Industry dynamics are quite attractive with an aging global population and the growth of improved healthcare in emerging markets; furthermore, most of its segments are highly concentrated with just 2-3 players that split each segment’s market share, affording the key participants with significant economies of scale and pricing power. The Company has been recently addressing several temporary headwinds including a strong dollar, inflation, a delayed recovery in surgical volumes from the coronavirus pandemic, and supply chain issues. Once these issues reach the rearview mirror, the Company’s growth and margin expansion plans should transform into reality.”14. GSK plc (NYSE:GSK)Fisher Asset Management's Stake Value: $492,994,000Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 35GSK plc (NYSE:GSK) is one of the leading pharmaceutical companies in the world, engaged in manufacturing medicines and vaccinations.

Investors are concerned about legal liabilities associated with its antacid drug Zantac. While it is impossible to know the outcome with certainty, our preliminary assessment suggests that the decline in market capitalization exceeds the likely financial impact on the company.”13. Roche Holding AG (OTC:RHHBY)Fisher Asset Management's Stake Value: $549,964,000Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 2Roche Holding AG (OTC:RHHBY) is a multinational pharmaceutical company that has operations in Switzerland, Germany, and the United States.

Two of our top five largest individual detractors for the period were in the health care sector: Sanofi (NASDAQ:SNY) and Bayer (OTCPK:BAYZF). Sanofi, a French pharmaceutical and health care company, saw its share price fall after it was named as a co-defendant in a class action lawsuit alleging that Sanofi and other sellers of the heartburn medication Zantac failed to warn of the drug’s risk of containing a possible carcinogen.”10.

Healthcare is generally less macro-sensitive than some other sectors. In a reversal of market sentiment compared to 2022, the healthcare sector has been under modest pressure due to what we consider to be some short-term transitory issues, while technology, particularly anything to do with AI, has become the market’s dish du jour. We have been selectively increasing our investment in a few very high-quality healthcare businesses at prices we consider to be fair. UnitedHealth Group Incorporated (NYSE:UNH) is now a top 10 holding, and our investment thesis is outlined in this report.We have previously written on our exposure to taxes through our investment in Intuit and its market leading TurboTax franchise (Intuit also owns the QuickBooks small business accounting franchise, Credit Karma and Mailchimp). UnitedHealth Group (UnitedHealth) is leading the charge to postpone the inevitable, while lowering overall healthcare system costs.U.S. health spending has outpaced GDP growth for decades, with spending on healthcare increasing from around 12% of GDP in the 1980s to nearly 20% today, driven by advancements in healthcare capabilities and an aging population with increased life expectancy…” (Click here to read the full text)9.

Paul Marshall and Ian Wace’s Marshall Wace LLP held a significant stake in the company, with 4.6 million shares worth $430.5 million. Baron Funds had this to say about Edwards Lifesciences Corporation (NYSE:EW) in its Q4 2022 investor letter:“Negative stock selection in health care equipment was related to sharp declines from fiber optic sensors manufacturer Opsens Inc., intravascular lithotripsy leader ShockWave Medical, Inc., and transcatheter aortic valve replacement pioneer Edwards Lifesciences Corporation (NYSE:EW) These companies were the top detractors from absolute performance, and we have detailed the reasons for recent share price weakness below.Edwards Lifesciences Corp. is the leading provider of valves for patients with heart disease. Shares fell after the company’s transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) business missed Street expectations again. Management attributed the sales shortfall to disruption from hospital staffing shortages, an issue that has an outsized impact on TAVR procedures because they are resource-intensive and require multiple specialists. We reduced the position due to increased uncertainty around the growth outlook.”8. Danaher Corporation (NYSE:DHR)Fisher Asset Management's Stake Value: $983,545,000Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 89Danaher Corporation (NYSE:DHR) is involved in the research, manufacture, design, and innovation of medical, commercial, and industrial products internationally.

Danaher has underperformed the S&amp;P 500 this year due to a slowdown in the bioprocessing industry and more cautious spending by biopharma customers. Bioprocessing is a key end-market that drives more than a quarter of Danaher’s profits. Bioprocessing products are the main inputs that biopharma companies use to manufacture biologic drugs, which are the fastest growing category of drugs, growing low-to-mid-teens and representing a sizable portion of the clinical pipeline.The bioprocessing industry experienced significant growth in 2021 and 2022, driven by Covid vaccines and a strong biotech funding environment. Several participants, including Danaher, lowered their 2023 growth outlook in large part due to customer inventory destocking and biotech funding weakness. We anticipate that this slowdown is temporary, and the bioprocessing industry will return to normalized growth of high-single digit to mid-teens in 2024 and beyond.…” (Click here to read the full text)7.

As long-term owners of the business, these test sales were never part of our original investment case. The core business, our primary focus, has a clear path of growing high single digits in 2023 with durable growth beyond, in our view. We believe the current price of 23x NTM P/E , while reasonable, is also misleading considering earnings this year will be artificially depressed because of the drop in COVID testing sales. On normalized earnings, the price is lower. We anticipate underlying EPS growth of at least low-teens over the next three to five years.Lastly, we trimmed Abbott Laboratories, bringing it back to a more average position size and to also fund our increase in Thermo Fisher. Abbott is entering a year in which the company is expected to see approximately $6bn in COVID-19 test sales disappear, thus creating a headwind for margins and EPS. That said, the core business has a clear path to growing high single digits in FY23. EPS grew at a 20% CAGR from 2019-2022, far beyond our expectations when we initiated our investment. Now, we expect a more normal growth rate of low teens EPS beyond this year. Further, management’s adeptness at allocating capital continues to impress us. We expect Abbott to drive top line growth without heavily investing in R&amp;D and SG&amp;A this year — management effectively “front-loaded” those investments in 2021 and 2022 when COVID test sales created a bolus of cash. We believe this should allow for leverage on the operating margin going forward. Combined, Abbott and Thermo Fisher now represent 7% of the Portfolio.”6.

For a quick overview of the top 5 food-exporting countries, read our article Top 5 Food Exporting Countries in the World.The global food export industry is constantly changing. Events like the COVID-19 pandemic, the Russia-Ukraine conflict, and rising inflation have messed with how food gets traded globally. But one thing has yet to change: how important it is for countries to sell food to other countries.Currently, the global population is more than 8 billion, and this number is expected to go up to 11.2 billion by 2100.  As the population grows and climate change alters annual food production in some countries by large numbers, the need for food exports will play an even bigger role in food security. Countries that can keep up with this demand are expected to do well in the global food export industry.Several food companies are dealing with the volatility in the commodities markets by taking several steps. For instance, Bunge Ltd (NYSE:BG), a global agribusiness and food company, uses hedging to protect itself from the risk of rising commodity prices. This means that the company locks in a commodity's worth in advance, protecting it from price fluctuations. Bunge Ltd (NYSE:BG) declared that the cost of goods sold went up by 10% in 2022 as compared to the end of 2021, driven by inflation.Bunge's stock performed well so far in 2023, returning around 18%. Despite the volatility in the commodities markets, the earnings increased by 11.9% in the past year. Bunge Ltd (NYSE:BG) also generated a trailing EPS of close to $13 and currently has a trailing P/E of less than 9. The company declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.6625 per common share on August 17, 2023.A Look into the Food IndustryOne of the top food exporting countries in the world, the United States, is also home to some of the largest supermarket chains in the world. Walmart (NYSE:WMT), for example, is the largest supermarket chain in the United States. As of August 2023, Walmart (NYSE:WMT) holds a market capitalization of $425.02 billion. With an 8.3% share in VanEck Vectors Retail ETF, Walmart (NYSE:WMT) holds the third rank among the list of 25 largest retail firms. It's a multi-category store, but the food and beverage category alone makes up to 60% of Walmart's US business.Story continuesThese chains have benefited from the growing food demand by expanding their operations and increasing their market share. In its Q2 earnings, Walmart (NYSE:WMT) disclosed that half of its sales come from food and related items. Walmart is the 39th most popular stock among the 900+ equity hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey at the end of June.Nestlé (OTCMKTS:NSRGY), one of the world's largest beverage companies, has a market cap of approximately $323 billion and has reported sales of $52.8 billion in the first 6 months of 2023, with net profit margin rising by 70 basis points to 12.2% as compared to last year. Nestle, known for its Kit Kat chocolate bars and Nescafe coffee, saw its earnings per share jump by 10.6% in the first half of 2023. This growth followed a 9.5% average price increase across its products. At the moment food companies don't experience any pushback from the consumers regarding passing along the increases in food prices.The Impact of Climate Change on Food ExportClimate change is having a significant impact on the global food exports. Changing weather patterns make it more challenging to grow crops and raise livestock. This is leading to food shortages in some parts of the world as well as an increase in food prices.For example, in 2021, a drought in California caused a shortage of fruits and vegetables, impacting more than 37 million people. The forecast for processing tomatoes in 2022 decreased to 10.5 million tons. This is a 10% decrease from the original prediction of 12.2 million tons. The drought has made it difficult to grow tomatoes, and it has also led to higher costs for water. The higher prices have made it less profitable for farmers to grow tomatoes, and some have switched to other crops.Moreover, two major factors, i.e., pollution and greenhouse gas emission, also play a negative role in the impact of climate change on food production. Utilizing renewable energy can reduce these negative impacts. In this regard, some prominent companies like Kellogg (NYSE:K) are playing their role. Kellogg (NYSE:K) is an American multinational food company, and it has set a goal of using 100% renewable energy by 2050. Kellogg (NYSE:K) has a current market capitalization of around $21 billion, making it one of the most valuable food companies in the world.Nestlé is also partnering with the National Fish and Wildlife Foundation to invest $30 million in the BeefUp Sustainability project. The project aims to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from beef production by up to 30% by 2030.MethodologyFor our list of the top 20 food exporting countries in the world, we used three key metrics: the value of food exports, volume of food exports, and food growth rate.To ensure the accuracy and reliability of our analysis, we draw upon reputable indexes, i.e., The Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO Stat), World Integrated Trade Solution (WITS), and The Observatory of Economic Complexity (OEC). By integrating data from these reliable indices, we present a list of the top 20 food exporting countries in the world, shedding light on their economic contributions and growth trajectories in the global food export country ranking.We started by scoring countries on each metric from 1 to 20 (1 indicating the highest rank and 20 the lowest in our study).To provide a balanced evaluation, each metric was assigned a specific weight, reflecting its relative importance:Value of food exports: 30%Volume of food exports: 30%Food export growth rate: 40%By considering these specific weights of each metric, weighted averages are calculated that reflect the relative significance of each criterion. We then ranked the countries in descending order from 20 to 1 (based on the weighted average results), with 1 representing the country with the most food exports and 20 representing the country with the least food exports on our list.Below is our list of the top 20 food exporting countries in the world.Top 20 Food Exporting Countries in the World20.

Instead, it's adopting a more forward-looking strategy towards real estate assets. Real estate experts exude a sense of careful optimism. Their strategy involves riding the existing slump while strategically preparing their companies for a future phase of consistent expansion and favorable financial outcomes. Valued at approximately $2.53 billion in 2023, the residential real estate market in the United States is projected to reach nearly $2.80 billion by 2028, as reported by Mordor Intelligence. This indicates a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of around 2.04% throughout the forecast period from 2023 to 2028. The prevailing trend of inflation in the country has deeply influenced businesses. Elevated inflation rates have prompted individuals to allocate more funds towards essential needs like sustenance and attire, concurrently impacting the real estate sector focused on home ownership. Since the COVID-19 pandemic, a multitude of buyers have capitalized on the favorable low interest rates to modify their home loans, move to new locations, or buy their first homes. As a result, there was a notable surge in home sales during the latter part of 2020, and this heightened level has persisted beyond the pre-pandemic period. Prior to the pandemic's onset, home values had been ascending, but with a remarkable surge in demand in 2020, the Freddie Mac House Price Index registered a staggering 11.3% escalation. Additionally, during the final quarter of 2021, a surplus of 142,406 housing units were accessible to address consumer needs, with more than 89% of these units being occupied by homeowners and renters. Moreover, the majority of transactions within this domain stem from citizens categorized as middle-aged and elderly. For example, individuals aged between 45 and 65 years represented over 70% of the country's homeownership rates throughout the four quarters of 2021. A substantial portion of the demand within this sector is fueled by condominiums and apartments. Apartments are projected to dominate this landscape compared to condominiums, as evidenced by the completion of 64,000 apartment units during the second quarter of 2021.Story continuesDon't Miss: 11 Most Undervalued REIT Stocks to Buy On the other hand, as per a separate report by Mordor Intelligence, the self-storage market in the United States is projected to increase from $43.34 billion in 2023 to approximately $48.73 billion by 2028, reflecting a CAGR of 2.37% within the forecast period. Owing to swift urbanization in the United States, the demand for self-storage facilities is on the rise. In 2020, as much as 82.66% of the population resided in urban regions, and projections indicate a surge to 89.16% by 2050. Consequently, the necessity for storage options is becoming increasingly urgent. Self-storage providers are capitalizing on this trend by constructing facilities in densely inhabited zones. This demand stems from multiple influences, including the prevalence of compact living spaces in heavily populated areas and individuals opting to move to smaller residences. Favorable economic momentum, including faster job establishment, elevated levels of confidence, and an increase in the number of households, is bolstering the self-storage industry. However, the expansion of the self storage market is at times hindered by government regulations. Also Read: 15 Worst Performing REITs in 2023Big moves are happening in the self storage industry. For example, in April 2023, Extra Space Storage Inc. (NYSE:EXR) announced its intention to purchase Life Storage for $12.7 billion. This acquisition will lead to the newly formed company becoming the largest operator of self-storage spaces in the U.S. in terms of the number of stores. The all-stock deal will effectively value the merged company at approximately $36 billion.

The stock had lagged because of two issues: first, frozen food manufacturers and their customers had labor issues that restricted production and thus the need for storage; and second, the company had execution issues. It seems like industry trends are improving. Plus, the company is making progress increasing its productivity and improving margins, somewhat from the effect of hiring some new senior executives.The stability of the business and the fact that it pays a nice dividend as a REIT is a positive in this market. Even after its recent pickup, we think the stock still trades at a modest cap rate and well below its private market value, so the stock can work via growth and multiple expansion.”10.

Investors looking to make a pivot away from overvalued tech stocks may want to look at undervalued industrial stocks.  You won’t find any industrial stocks in the “Magnificent 7” stocks that led the market rally earlier this year. But industrial stocks are magnificent in their own way, if you’re a fan of companies that deliver consistent growth over time. The industrial sector contains some of the oldest, and most respected, companies in the world. What they lack in style, they make up for in substance. InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsThese companies make up the backbone of the U.S. and global economy. It’s not an understatement to say the economy couldn’t perform without the products and services these companies provide. And many industrial stocks offer reliable dividends to go along with reliable revenue and earnings. That’s an evergreen formula for investors who are looking for a total return that beats fixed-income investments. But industrial stocks will also appeal to growth investors when they are trading at a discount to their intrinsic value. With that in mind, here are seven undervalued industrial stocks to buy for growth in a volatile market.  Deere &amp; Company (DE) Several John Deere vehicles are parked outside of a building.Source: Jim Lambert / Shutterstock.comDeere &amp; Company (NYSE:DE) reminds investors that price is what you pay, and value is what you get. Shares of DE stock don’t come cheap. You’ll pay around $420 per share at the time I’m writing this. The stock is commanding a high price because of the company’s position in robotics and artificial intelligence (AI). But does that make Deere expensive? Not necessarily. For starters, the stock is currently trading at around 13.3x forward earnings. That’s low compared to the overall sector and to the P/E ratio of DE stock in the last five years. Deere is also a favorite of industrial investors. Over 70% of the stock is controlled by the major institutions, and for the last several quarters, buyers have outnumbered sellers by almost two to one.  Story continuesThat’s probably why 18 out of 26 analysts who have rated DE stock in the last three months give the stock a Strong Buy or Buy rating. Their consensus buy target is $456.32 per share. That’s about an 8% gain from the stock’s current price. And investors also get a dividend that currently pays $5 per share annually. That dividend has been growing for several years.  Crown Holdings (CCK) In this photo illustration Crown Holdings, Inc. (CCK) logo seen displayed on a smartphone in the background.Source: IgorGolovniov / Shutterstock.comCrown Holdings (NYSE:CCK) is one of the world’s leading manufacturers of aluminum cans. As the world looks for sustainable solutions what’s old has become new again. Namely, we’re moving away from plastic bottles and tapping into old-school aluminum cans.  That may not be as exciting as investing in the hottest AI stock. Still, it’s something to think about when considering undervalued industrial stocks while you’re drinking your favorite flavored mineral water … in an aluminum can.  CCK stock is down 1% in the last month, which is a slight pullback from the stock’s 6.7% growth so far in 2023. This is likely a reaction to the company’s earnings. Crown missed on the top line and both revenue and earnings were down YoY. Analysts still believe earnings will climb by 16% next year. There’s a good chance that’s not being priced into CCK stock right now. But analysts are forecasting a 17% upside in CCK stock, so now is an excellent time to take a position.  Avery Dennison (AVY) Source: ShutterstockAvery Dennison (NYSE:AVY) is next on this list of undervalued industrial stocks. AVY stock is down right around 2% in 2023 and 11.7% in the last 12 months.  The company’s most recent earnings report is weighing on AVY stock. The leader in materials science missed on revenue and earnings. But the commentary in the earnings call may have soured investors. Management said it underestimated the weakness in demand and was still working to right-size its inventory. That being said, the company did report higher margins despite the lower volume. And analysts are projecting earnings growth of nearly 20% in the next 12 months. That’s a formula that will work well for investors.  Avery Dennison is a little expensive at about 22x forward earnings. But if the earnings projections are realistic, the stock price will catch up. Of the 14 analysts that have rated AVY stock in the last three months, 11 give the stock either a Buy or Strong Buy rating.  Johnson Controls International (JCI) A sign for a Johnson Controls location showing the logo and address of the company.Source: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.comJohnson Controls International (NYSE:JCI) is one of the few pure plays in the Internet of Things (IoT) sector. In fact, investors will also get some exposure to artificial intelligence when they invest in JCI stock. That focus on technology is one reason JCI stock is down over 7.5% in 2023 and 4.5% in the last month. However, Johnson Controls makes this list of undervalued industrial stocks because of a recent innovation that may not be priced into the stock.  The company’s OpenBlue platform is an AI-powered platform that provides “remote diagnostics, predictive maintenance, compliance monitoring, remote risk assessments, and more.” This platform has a large addressable market across a range of industries. That growth opportunity is likely why analysts forecast a 14% jump in earnings next year. Speaking of the analysts, 17 out of 23 give JCI stock either a Buy or Strong Buy rating with a price target of $74.25, more than 20% above the stock’s price as of August 17.  Xylem (XYL) xylem appSource: IgorGolovniov / Shutterstock.comOne of the appealing aspects of investing in industrial companies is that they produce essential products. That’s the case with Xylem (NYSE:XYL). The company designs, manufactures, and services engineered products and solutions for the water and wastewater industries.  The demand for the company’s services can be summed up in one statistic. The average water main in the United States may be up to 50 years old. That makes them prone to leaks which is a problem that Xylem helps address. In 2023, that makes Xylem a candidate for environmentally conscious investors.  A forward P/E ratio of 27x doesn’t make Xylem dramatically undervalued. However, analysts are forecasting 18% upside for XYL stock.  At first glance, Xylem doesn’t have an impressive dividend with a yield of just 1.32%. However, the company has increased its dividend for 12 consecutive years. If earnings growth comes in as expected, that growth is likely to continue, as will the payout per share which is currently $1.32.  Dover Corporation (DOV) The logo for Dover (DOV) displayed on a smartphone screen.Source: IgorGolovniov / Shutterstock.comDover Corporation (NYSE:DOV) is the kind of company that comes to mind when you think about an industrial stock. The company’s list of products and services won’t light up investors in the same way that generative AI currently does. But they are just as essential.  Like many companies on this list, Dover missed on earnings in its most recent quarter and the results were also lower YoY. That reflects an economy that is slowing down. But as the economy recovers, Dover is one company that will benefit.  Dover has a forward P/E ratio of just 15x and analysts forecast 9.9% earnings growth and a 16% growth in the DOV stock price. And that growth comes with one of the safest dividends in the industry. Dover is a Dividend King that has increased its dividend in each of the last 68 years.  Axon Enterprise (AXON) Person holding mobile phone with logo of American weapon manufacturer Axon Enterprise Inc. on screen in front of webpage. Focus on cellphone display. Unmodified photo.Source: T. Schneider / Shutterstock.comAxon Enterprise (NASDAQ:AXON) won’t be the first name you think about if you’re looking for undervalued industrial stocks. For starters, it’s the only stock on this list that trades on the tech-heavy NASDAQ exchange.  The company offers a portfolio of law enforcement technology solutions that work together to support its vision to “cut gun-related deaths between police and the public by 50% in 10 years.” The company forecasts a $50 billion total addressable market with a growing base of recurring revenue from SaaS products.  Public safety may not be the primary issue in the 2024 election, but it’s going to be a significant part of the conversation. And Axon has the products and services for state and local governments who will be looking for solutions that support both public safety and new-age policing,  Traditional fundamentals suggest that AXON stock may be overvalued. But if the company makes good on forecasts for 36% earnings growth, the stock will have room to grow into its valuation.  On the date of publication, Chris Markoch did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

Domestic refined fuel demand is looking up and natural gas demand will maintain growth and that of chemical products will rebound gradually,"" Sinopec said.That will bring its annual throughput to 253.5 million tons for 2023, marking growth of 4.7% versus 2022, according to Reuters calculations based on company data.Sinopec on Sunday reported a 20.1% fall in interim net profit for the first half of the year compared with the same period of 2022, to 35.11 billion yuan ($4.82 billion), on lower crude prices despite higher refinery output and growth in fuel sales.Its revenue slipped 1.1% to 1.59 trillion yuan for the six months, although it recorded an 18.5% increase in total domestic and overseas refined fuel sales of 116.6 million tons.China's fuel demand continued to recover in the second quarter after a 6.7% year-on-year increase in the first three months, with gasoline and aviation fuel leading the way as people travelled more.Sinopec said its first-half domestic fuel sales rose 17.9% from a year earlier to 92.47 million tons.Demand for diesel fuel, however, remained under pressure from an ailing property sector and as weakening merchandise exports curbed trucking.Chinese refiners overall benefited from cheap crude oil supplies from Iran, Venezuela and Russia, as Western sanctions forced those producers to sell oil at deep discounts to keep revenue flowing.Story continuesAlthough state majors have shied away from Iranian and Venezuelan oil, Sinopec has been taking in Russian supplies, traders have said.Sinopec produced 139.68 million barrels of crude oil during the six months, up 0.02% year on year. Its natural gas output gained 7.6% to 660.88 billion cubic feet (18.714 billion cubic metres).The company's refining margin was 354 yuan ($48.57) per ton in the first half of this year, down 33.6% from a year earlier, it said.Sinopec plans capital spending of 104 billion yuan during the second half of the year, 38.7% above spending during the first half, on oil and gas fields like Tahe in Xinjiang and Weirong in Sichuan, as well as refinery expansion at Zhenhai.Sinopec has been exploring more geologically challenging reserves, like the Bazhong tight gas field and more shale gas acreage in Sichuan.($1 = 7.2890 yuan)(Reporting by Chen Aizhu and Judy Hua; Editing by Robert Birsel and Tom Hogue)]"

Yet, it would still be less than is necessary to secure enough supply to respond to demand.That’s the take of Wood Mackenzie analysts, at least, who recently reported that the oil and gas industry is currently in the third year of an upcycle, with this year’s investments in new production at $490 billion. This would be significantly higher than the low reached in 2020, which stood at $370 billion.Even though spending on its own is not enough to secure supply, the Wood Mac analysts noted in an interview for the firm that cost reductions will make up for the difference. They note the rise of U.S. shale and other non-OPEC sources, and forecast non-OPEC producers to maintain a constant market share in the coming years.Indeed, this chimes in with what U.S. oil industry executives reported during the latest financial reporting season. What the said, basically, was that wells were yielding more oil than expected, boosting total production. The reason wells were yielding more: technological improvements.Argus reported earlier this month, citing Pioneer Natural Resources, that well productivity since the start of the year has been trending significantly higher than the average for 2022. At the same time, however, Bloomberg recently cited research from Enverus suggesting that shale wells were draining faster than previously assumed, with few untapped reservoirs left as the shale patch gets mature.Besides U.S. oil, there is also Canada, Mexico, Brazil, and smaller producers such as Guyana. These have contributed significantly to global supply, but OPEC remains the biggest fish in the oil pond because of its common supply control policies.Story continuesWhat’s more, with the expansion of the BRICS bloc, we get another grouping of some of the largest producers in the world, partly overlapping with OPEC but also including Brazil and Argentina.Groupings aside, global investments in new oil and gas supplied are well and truly on a rise despite the transition push. Goldman Sachs reported last month that there were currently 70 large-scale oil and gas projects under development globally right now. That was up by a substantial 25% from 2020, although 2020 could hardly be seen as a normal year for investment decision-making in any industry except perhaps IT.Per the investment bank, the seven-year-long underinvestment period led to a sharp decline in the resource life of future projects as well as the life of already producing fields. With a rebound in investment, this may yet change. Wood Mac, on the other hand, warns of peak demand and a fundamental change in the oil and gas industry driven by the prospect of that.According to upstream analysts Fraser McKay and Ian Thom, the current cycle will not end with a bust as all previous cycles in the industry did. The reason: the prospect of peak oil demand caused by the transition to non-hydrocarbon energy sources. This prospect, they argued, would keep oil and gas producers on their toes and maintain their financial discipline over the longer term.Still, despite the prospect of peak demand, even Wood Mac analysts are worried about the lack of a spare production capacity cushion, which could be viewed as a side effect of this newly found discipline with spending and focus on efficiency while adjusting to a world in transition.“We expect companies to go for margin rather than market share; and upstream supply chain capacity to creep rather than leap, which has been the traditional response in an upcycle,” McKay and Thom said, adding “That restraint could lead to a tighter supply chain than the industry has been used to.”While peak demand for oil is something that a lot of forecasters talk about and even call for openly, for now it remains on the horizon while actual demand for oil breaks record after record. Even the International Energy Agency, a vocal transition advocate and peak oil demand forecaster said that over the short-term demand is going to grow, hitting a record of over 102 million barrels daily this year.This makes the global balance between supply and demand perhaps a bit more precarious than the Wood Mac analysis suggests. While it’s true that technological gains have played an important role in keeping production high while reducing costs, U.S. shale drillers have steered clear of their previous setting of “growth at all costs”.Meanwhile, OPEC is keeping a lid on output with the novel option for individual members—Saudi Arabia—to cut additional volumes whenever they decide to, in order to push prices higher. And OPEC, in a sense, grew with the BRICS expansion.The oil and gas industry is spending more on new production despite the transition push. This means expectations are that peak oil demand is a relatively distant prospect. It might even become more distant if the transition begins to show signs of exhaustion amid substantial cost inflation and the risks of raw material shortages.By Irina Slav for Oilprice.comRead this article on OilPrice.com]"

Despite both ETFs surging by more than 30% this year following a dismal performance in 2022, Sohn identified the outflows from the Invesco QQQ Trust (NASDAQ:QQQ) in this year as unusual. He noted that even though investors are gravitating toward the smaller, more economical version of the fund, the Invesco NASDAQ 100 ETF (NASDAQ:QQQM), for tech exposure, the substantial gains of the former haven't been accompanied by a clear trend of herd behavior. Regarding the Technology Select Sector SPDR Fund (NYSE:XLK), ETF investors seem to still harbor ""some skepticism"" about the recovery of the U.S. equity market from the harsh downturn of the previous year, Sohn commented. Dave Nadig, a financial futurist at VettaFi, believes that another profitable stretch awaits in the technology and artificial intelligence space. However, he indicated that there are constraints to the potential upside. Nadig forecasted that the sectors set to experience the most significant growth are industrial, robotics, and automation. He commented: “AI is going to have a long-term and significant positive effect on GDP ... [But] it’s very difficult to pick public companies that are going to be the outsized beneficiaries of that. We run into this all the time when we have cool new technology … and we end up buying Google and Microsoft and Apple and Nvidia, which we all already probably own too much of.”Story continuesNVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) CEO Jensen Huang expects that the surge in artificial intelligence will extend well into 2024. To substantiate his optimism, he made what could possibly be the largest individual investment in the technology sector. NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)’s Q2 financial results exceeded Wall Street's predictions, and the company disclosed intentions to repurchase an additional $25 billion worth of its own common shares – a strategy commonly employed when a company's leadership believes its value is underrated. Although NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)’s stock price has surged by over threefold this year and was poised to achieve a record peak following Q2 results, the company intends to boost the production of its hardware well into the following year. This has effectively dispelled concerns raised by a few analysts regarding the sustainability of the AI frenzy. Additionally, NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) enjoys a near-monopoly over the computing systems that drive services like ChatGPT. In this article, we discuss some of the best performing technology ETFs in 2023, which offer investors exposure to Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO), Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), and DraftKings Inc. (NASDAQ:DKNG). Our Methodology We used an ETF screener and filtered out the best performing technology ETFs in 2023 based on year-to-date share price performance.

Invesco QQQ Trust (NASDAQ:QQQ)YTD Share Price Performance as of August 24: 39.82%From its inception in 1999, Invesco QQQ Trust (NASDAQ:QQQ) has consistently shown a track record of strong performance, often surpassing the S&amp;P 500 Index.

(NASDAQ:AAPL) in its second quarter 2023 investor letter:“Dramatic valuation differences across market cap sizes continue. This has been the case for some time now. Perhaps I have spent too much time discussing these dichotomies, as generally, I feel like if we pick the right stocks and manage market exposures thoughtfully, our equities- oriented portfolio will prosper across various market cycles. However, when markets become as lopsided as they have lately, I feel additional discussion on the market environment is worthwhile, if only to help highlight the opportunities that are available and the likely path forward. I expect future discussions to soon be focused again on our moderately concentrated portfolio. But for now, let’s take one last in-depth look at how far reaching these valuation dichotomies have again become.(Please note: charts that accompany the following can be found in the Appendix.)Take Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) for example. It is the largest stock by market cap, and fairly considered one of the best companies in the world. The company has been extraordinarily successful and improved standards of living everywhere in the process with their ubiquitous products. Along the way, shareholders have been richly rewarded, with shares increasing nearly fourteen-fold over the last ten years while generating an annualized total shareholder return of 31%, including dividends.On the back of another big quarter for large cap tech, it is now the first stock to surpass the $3T market cap threshold. This makes its weighting in the ~$37T market cap of the S&amp;P 500, ~8%. It also means this one stock’s market cap is larger than that of the entire ~$2.98T market cap of the Russell 2000 index, the first time in history a single stock has outweighed the Russell 2000 – aside from two brief days in September 2020 when Apple’s market cap then accomplished the same…” (Click here to read the full text)9.

Chip densities are now approaching the limits of physics and Moore’s law is stretched to its atomic limitations. Future innovation is around 3D stacks of chips and advanced packaging. LAM has heavily invested in tools that push innovation at the atomic level. Despite this investment, it requires little shareholder capital to grow and therefore it returns capital through healthy dividends and share repurchases. LAM has been a wonderful performer for us over the last two years.”8. iShares Expanded Tech Sector ETF (NYSE:IGM)YTD Share Price Performance as of August 24: 41.39%iShares Expanded Tech Sector ETF (NYSE:IGM) aims to replicate the investment outcomes of the S&amp;P North American Expanded Technology Sector Index, which includes technology sector firms in North America, along with companies from communication services and consumer discretionary sectors. iShares Expanded Tech Sector ETF (NYSE:IGM) was established on March 13, 2001.

Shares continued their torrid first quarter rise, increasing 52.3% in the second quarter (now up 190% year-to-date), after the company reported a meaningful acceleration in demand for its data center GPUs, which drove a material guidance beat with revenues expected to increase from $7.2 billion to approximately $11 billion sequentially. This unprecedented acceleration is driven by growing demand for GenAI. We are at the tipping point of a new era of computing with NVIDIA at its epicenter. While the opportunity within the datacenter installed base is already large at approximately $1 trillion, the pace of innovation in AI in general, and GenAI in particular, should drive a significant expansion in the addressable market, as AI creates a new way for human-computer interaction through language, and as companies are better able to utilize their data for decision-making. We remain shareholders as we believe NVIDIA’s end-to-end AI platform and the ecosystem it has cultivated over the last 15 years will benefit the company for years to come.”7. ARK Fintech Innovation ETF (NYSE:ARKF)YTD Share Price Performance as of August 24: 41.78%ARK Fintech Innovation ETF (NYSE:ARKF) is an actively managed ETF aiming to attain long-term capital appreciation by investing in domestic and international stocks of firms involved in innovative financial technology. Established on February 4, 2019, ARK Fintech Innovation ETF (NYSE:ARKF) comes with an expense ratio of 0.75%. Its portfolio consists of around 35-55 stocks. ARK Fintech Innovation ETF (NYSE:ARKF) is one of the top performing technology ETFs this year. Crypto giant Coinbase Global, Inc.

(NASDAQ:COIN) announced that it is investing in Circle, the company behind the creation of USD Coin, a stablecoin pegged to the US dollar. This move by Coinbase Global, Inc.

Cathie Wood’s ARK Investment Management is the biggest stakeholder of the company, with 12.12 million shares worth $867.3 million. Here is what Hayden Capital has to say about Coinbase Global, Inc. (NASDAQ:COIN) in its Q2 2022 investor letter:“Coinbase (NASDAQ:COIN): The crypto ecosystem moves extremely quickly, and there’s been many new developments since we first invested in Coinbase, a year ago. Most notably, crypto market cap has declined from a peak of ~$3 Trillion last fall, to ~$1.1 Trillion today (a -63% decline, and -72% peak-to-trough; LINK). Crypto is a volatile asset class, and has experienced many draw-downs of similar magnitude in the past. For example, Bitcoin was down -93% during 2011, -85% from 2013-15, and -84% from 2017-18. In this context, the latest draw-down is a pretty normal outcome for this emerging asset class.A large reason for this volatility is simply because there aren’t any major “real-world use cases” for the asset just yet. In our letter outlining the investment last year, we wrote that crypto is still “in the middle of ‘crossing the chasm’ into mainstream adoption &amp; use cases, which will result in millions of mainstream users needing to transact crypto in some form”…” (Click here to see the full text)6. SPDR NYSE Technology ETF (NYSE:XNTK) YTD Share Price Performance as of August 24: 44.86%SPDR NYSE Technology ETF (NYSE:XNTK)’s objective is to achieve investment outcomes that, prior to deducting fees and costs, closely match the overall return performance of the NYSE Technology Index. This index includes equities within the information technology sector as well as technology-related stocks within the consumer discretionary sector. As of August 24, 2023, the ETF comes with an expense ratio of 0.35%. Its portfolio consists of 35 stocks. SPDR NYSE Technology ETF (NYSE:XNTK) is one of the best performing technology ETFs in 2023. Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) is one of the top holdings of SPDR NYSE Technology ETF (NYSE:XNTK). Following its strong performance in the second quarter and the positive guidance provided, Wall Street analysts showered Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) with praise. On July 27, Ronald Josey, a Citi analyst, reaffirmed a Buy recommendation on Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META). He highlighted the impressive reception of fresh advertising formats such as Sponsored Reels and the popularity of Click-to-WhatsApp among advertisers.According to Insider Monkey’s second quarter database, 225 hedge funds were long Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META), compared to 220 funds in the prior quarter. Chase Coleman’s Tiger Global Management is the leading stakeholder of the company, with 8.5 million shares worth $2.45 billion. In addition to Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO), Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), and DraftKings Inc. (NASDAQ:DKNG), Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) is one of the best tech stocks to invest in. Giverny Capital Asset Management made the following comment about Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) in its second quarter 2023 investor letter:“I have believed for a while that we’re better served with a lower weight to the tech giants – we own Alphabet (8.1% of our model portfolio at the end of June) and Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) (5.2%) for a 13.3% exposure, or about half the Index’s weight in the giants. And while Alphabet’s 36% return for the first half and Meta’s 138% return were gratefully received, I’m pleased to report that if we strip out that contribution to our overall return, the other 23 stocks we own, constituting 85% of our portfolio (with cash making up the balance), were up 10.2% on a weighted basis.GCAM owns two of the seven tech mega caps in Alphabet and Meta, and they enjoyed similar rises. As mentioned, Alphabet A&amp;C shares rose 36% while Meta rose 138%. Together, they added 2.38 percentage points to the overall Index return, meaning these seven tech giants cumulatively generated 12.4 percentage points of return, or roughly three-quarters of the Index’s return.Alphabet and Meta combined sport a $2.25 trillion market cap and between them should generate roughly $120 billion of pretax profit this year. That’s a multiple of 19 times pretax profit, a substantial discount to Microsoft and Apple, and an even larger discount to Amazon, Nvidia and Tesla.” Click to continue reading and see 5 Best Performing Technology ETFs in 2023.  Suggested articles:Long-Term Returns of Keith Meister's Activist Targets11 Most Undervalued Dow Stocks To Buy According To Hedge Funds11 Most Undervalued REIT Stocks to Buy Disclosure: None. 10 Best Performing Technology ETFs in 2023 is originally published on Insider Monkey.]"

But let me explain what this chart is first – it measures the difference between the yields of two U.S. Treasury securities with different maturities. The 10-2 year Treasury yield spread is often used as an indicator of the yield curve’s shape and the economy’s direction. A positive spread means that the 10-year Treasury yield is higher than the 2-year Treasury yield, which implies that investors expect higher inflation and greater economic growth in the future. Conversely, A negative spread means that the 2-year Treasury yield is higher than the 10-year Treasury yield, which implies that investors expect lower inflation and economic growth in the future. This yield curve is inverted right now.That’s not inherently a bad thing. What is bad is when that inverted yield curve starts spiking back to normalcy again. This has been a prelude to almost every major recession, including the Covid downturn and the technical recession (two quarters of negative GDP growth) in Q1 2022 and Q2 2022. Right now, we do have a strong labor market to counteract these recessionary fears, but with the economy starting to digest the rate hikes, the labor market is softening.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsOf course, predicting recessions is notoriously difficult, and it’s entirely possible the economy may surpass expectations in 2024. Nevertheless, adding some exposure to recession-resistant stocks seems sensible, given the uncertain macro outlook. At a minimum, these stocks can provide ballast to portfolios in choppy markets while still offering solid return potential over the long-run. Let’s dive in.Flowers Foods (FLO)bakery breads, buns and pastries on a wooden cutting board in a display caseSource: shutterstock.com/ampersandphotoStory continuesIf you’re hunting for stability, you can’t go wrong with a classic defensive name like Flowers Foods (NYSE:FLO). This baked goods stalwart boasts a track record of growing sales and dividends consistently over the years, even through the pandemic. The company’s brands like Nature’s Own and Dave’s Killer Bread enjoy tremendous consumer loyalty.While costs are rising across the industry, Flowers has implemented smart pricing moves to offset inflation. And its strategy is working – the company just delivered 9% sales growth last quarter, trouncing estimates. For 2023, analysts see steady mid-single-digit top-line gains continuing. When folks get nervous, they still buy bread.Additionally, with shares down 11% this year, investors can grab Flowers’ defensive profile at a reasonable price. At 20-times forward earnings and with a 3.7% dividend yield, FLO stock offers a tasty recipe for stability and income. This company’s fundamentals never go stale.Clorox (CLX)Clorox bleach bottles lined up on a store shelf.Source: TY Lim / Shutterstock.comAs economic outlooks cloud over, Clorox (NYSE:CLX) stands out as a relatively safe play in the consumer space. The company is hitting its stride in 2023 after a tough 2022 when waning pandemic demand and supply issues plagued performance.But now, Clorox is back with a vengeance. Last quarter, the company grew sales by 12% behind brand powerhouses like its namesake Bleach and Glad. Management sees high single-digit earnings per share growth continuing next fiscal year. As management says, “we expect stronger growth in the front half as we continue to lap the two price increases that we have. And then in the back half, we expect it to get tougher for consumers. And right now, our expectation is a mild recession.” Thus, management seems prepared for the possibility of a 2024 recession, even if it is a mild one.While CLX stock isn’t crazy cheap, defensive stocks seldom are these days. I’m happy to pay up for the safety and growth in times like these.Sysco (SYY)Best Stocks for Students: Sysco (SYY)Source: ShutterstockSysco (NYSE:SYY) stock declined a little this year, but the rout feels overdone. Shares of SYY stock are down more than 20% in 2022, despite Sysco churning out record sales and profits last quarter. As the market leader in U.S. food distribution, Sysco enjoys immense scale advantages that breed stability.Sure, food inflation poses challenges on margins, but Sysco boasts the pricing power to offset those headwinds. Analysts see revenue growth continuing at a 4.3% clip in fiscal 2023. And even after its steep haircut this year, they still see nearly 20% upside in the stock.With its 1.9% dividend yield, Sysco gives investors a chance to gain stable exposure to defensive food distribution at a now-reasonable valuation. The crowd may have overreacted on this one, making now a good time to nibble.Dollar General (DG)Dollar General (DG) store front with yellow store sign, middaySource: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.comWhen economic dread sets in, discount retailers like Dollar General (NYSE:DG) get their chance to shine. Catering squarely to budget-minded shoppers, Dollar General enjoys powerful recession resilience. Its incredible store growth and market share gains have continued this year, even as its stock sank over 37% amid margin pressures.But don’t count Dollar General out. Analysts see a sales growing at a compound rate of roughly 12% annually over this decade. And they expect its beaten-down stock to power forward nearly 20%. DG’s extreme value focus never goes out of favor in tough times, especially when pennies get pinched.With shares substantially discounted already, I think Dollar General looks like a relative bargain here for investors seeking safety. Its defensive attributes should cushion any portfolio in a downturn.Duke Energy (DUK)5 Utility Stocks to Buy for an Extra Durable PortfolioSource: ShutterstockDo you know what sector gets dubbed “recession-proof” when economic anxieties strike? Utilities. Providers like Duke Energy (NYSE:DUK) enjoy very steady demand profiles and operate under the safety net of regulation. While Duke isn’t immune to impacts like weather and higher interest costs, its advantages abound.Remarkably, Duke’s stock proved resilient last year, down just 2% compared to the broader market carnage. Now, DUK stock did fall nearly 12% this year, but still offers a secure 4.5% dividend yield. Duke’s growth outlook has dimmed near term, but analysts still see ~7% year-over-year earnings growth over the long haul.Given that Duke has already taken quite the beating from this year’s storm, I think its upside/downside skew looks attractive. This utility giant should keep charging forward reliably for years to come, making it a cornerstone holding.PepsiCo (PEP)Cans of PepsiCo's Pepsi soda are in a bucket of ice.Source: suriyachan / Shutterstock.comPepsiCo’s (NYSE:PEP) massive brand portfolio, including Pepsi, Frito-Lay, and Quaker Oats, provides immense consumer reach and recession resilience. This snacking and beverage empire simply has no rivals matching its scale and geographic diversification. Pepsi recently delivered 10.4% sales growth, continuing to gain market share as consumers scrambled for indulgent snacks to lift spirits.Is PEP stock pricey at 24-times earnings? Sure. But safety has its price. And analysts still see 13% upside here.Between its 2.8% dividend and steady mid-single-digit profit growth, I’m happily nibbling on Pepsi stock for ballast.Mondelez (MDLZ)The Mondelez website magnified by a magnifying glassSource: ShutterstockLike PepsiCo, Mondelez (NASDAQ:MDLZ) offers global snacking powerhouse status, making it a relatively safe bet if a 2024 recession strikes. With brands like Oreo, Ritz, and Cadbury under its belt, Mondelez reaches billions of treat-seeking consumers worldwide.The company just delivered 17% sales growth in its Q2 results. Pricing actions fueled the gains, highlighting the loyalty its brands command. With MDLZ stock down modestly this year, its 22-times price-earnings ratio looks reasonable for a name of this quality.Analysts see above-average earnings growth continuing for Mondelez, forecasting 15% upside with this consumer discretionary giant. It’s not the flashiest pick, but for investors seeking exposure to defensive sectors, Mondelez looks tasty at current levels.On the date of publication, Omor Ibne Ehsan did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

24,7ed9498f-24e5-3115-881e-c4964ba675a3,ADM,2023-08-27,7 Stocks That Wall Street Is Ignoring (But Shouldn’t Be!),InvestorPlace,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/7-stocks-wall-street-ignoring-195632792.html,1692561392,STORY,"['CI', 'TITN', 'ADM', 'WY']","[With thousands of publicly traded securities available, it’s inevitable that more than a few names will classify as under-the-radar stocks to buy for discerning investors. I don’t say this to cast aspersions on any market expert. Rather, it’s just a fact of life: people can’t be all things at all times.Still, this framework opens doors of opportunities for those interested in potentially robust stocks to buy. First, market ideas that fall far away from the spotlight generally don’t receive much analyst coverage and/or retail trading volume. However, should circumstances start turning favorably, the wave could rush in, thus handsomely rewarding those who initiated positions early.Second, under-the-radar stocks theoretically offer a higher margin of safety. For example, if a flavor of the week loses sentiment, the underlying security can tumble in a hurry. However, lesser-known ideas didn’t receive much fanfare anyways; thus, there might not be much to fall to.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsStill, going off the beaten path carries risks of business unpredictability, among other headwinds. If you can accept that, perhaps these stocks to buy should be on your watch list.Stocks to Buy: Cigna (CI)Cigna logo displayed on a modern smartphone. CI stock.Source: Piotr Swat / ShutterstockUnquestionably, healthcare services provider Cigna (NYSE:CI) represents an incredibly relevant enterprise. At the same time, many investors refuse to consider it one of the stocks to buy because it’s incredibly boring. Plus, it has become surprisingly volatile. Since the start of the year, the CI stock slipped almost 16%. Much of the pain came as Wall Street digested its mixed second-quarter earnings report.Still, the fallout in CI seems a bit overdone, making it one of the under-the-radar stocks. To be fair, Cigna’s three-year revenue growth rate (per-share basis) of 12.4% sits right on the median line of its industry. However, buyers would be getting a great deal for that top-line performance, with shares trading at only 0.44x trailing-year sales. In contrast, the sector median comes in at 0.68x.Story continuesJust as you might expect from a relevant enterprise, Cigna is consistently profitable, with a trailing-year net margin of 3.58% (above 68.42% of rivals). Nevertheless, the market prices CI at a forward multiple of 11.03x. As a discount to projected earnings, Cigna ranks better than 66.67% of the competition.Archer-Daniels-Midland (ADM)An image of a street sign post with directions labeled ""Buy"", ""Hold"", and ""Sell""Source: PX Media / ShutterstockIf we were speaking colloquially, I’d say that multinational food processing and commodities trading firm Archer-Daniels-Midland (NYSE:ADM) sells itself, with some choice colorful phrases thrown in there for good effect. At the end of the day, no matter how advanced we as humans get, we’ll still need nourishment to thrive. On that note, ADM effectively operates as a permanently relevant enterprise.Nevertheless, ADM incurred much choppiness throughout this year. Against the Jan. opener, shares find themselves down about 8%. Naturally, Russia’s invasion of Ukraine threw the global food supply chain for a loop, along with the sourcing of critical commodities. Still, food-related businesses should be long-term resilient just out of necessity.Financially, ADM is also quite intriguing. Right now, the company prints a three-year revenue growth rate of 16.4%, ranked better than 76.9% of its peers. Despite this, shares trade at only 0.46x sales, ranked favorably lower than 72.41% of companies listed in the consumer packaged goods industry. Thus, it’s one of the under-the-radar stocks to buy.Stocks to Buy: Titan Machinery (TITN)Man holding stacks of money. Unknown Millionaire-Maker cryptos. Strong Buy Stocks.Source: Epic Cure / ShutterstockAn incredibly risky bet, based on its chart performance – or lack thereof – Titan Machinery (NASDAQ:TITN) doesn’t get the attention it deserves. Still, I believe it’s still one of the top stocks to buy for contrarians willing to take the adventurous path. As one of the largest U.S.-based dealers of agricultural and construction equipment, Titan commands permanent relevance.With the growing domestic and global population, food resources have never been more critical. So, while Titan does have its issues – such as a cash-to-debt ratio that sits at a lowly 0.06x – the broader fundamentals should make up for it. However, Wall Street doesn’t see it that way yet. Since the start of this year, TITN fell more than 27%.However, Titan enjoys over the past three years a revenue and EBITDA growth rate of 18.4% and 46.2%, respectively. Both stats easily exceed their respective sector median stats. Yet TITN trades at only 5.87x trailing earnings without non-recurring items (NRI). As a discount to profitability, Titan ranks better than 83.46% of its peers.Weyerhaeuser (WY)Weyergaeuser logo on a smartphone with a keyboard in the background.Source: rafapress / ShutterstockAn American timberland company, Weyerhaeuser (NYSE:WY) owns nearly 12.4 million acres of timberlands in the U.S., per its public profile. In addition, it manages an additional 14 million acres of timberlands under long-term licenses in Canada. Plus, Weyerhaeuser features a long history of manufactured wood products. Frankly, it’s one of the top under-the-radar stocks to buy.Right now, one of the biggest problems facing the consumer economy is the lack of affordable housing. More than just an individual financial burden, denying first-time homebuyers access to real estate may impose a generational crisis. Basically, it would disrupt the cradle-to-grave lifecycle of any society. But what could ease this problem? Building out more homes, which could richly benefit WY.Not surprisingly, in my view, Weyerhaeuser features an impressive three-year revenue growth rate of 16%, beating out 90% of competitors. However, WY trades at only 2.98x sales, below the sector median of 6.31x. This bargain might not last for long.Stocks to Buy: Brookfield Reinsurance (BNRE)Source: ShutterstockIf you thought Cigna was boring as heck, check out Brookfield Reinsurance (NYSE:BNRE). A specialist in the namesake industry, reinsurance is “a way of transferring some of the financial risk that insurance companies assume when insuring cars, homes, people, and businesses to another company, the reinsurer,” according to Investopedia.Again, it sounds like a snooze-inducing concept. Here’s what you really need to know. According to Allied Market Research, the global reinsurance market reached a valuation of $498.7 billion in 2021. Further, experts project that by 2031, the segment will hit $1.34 trillion. This represents a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 10.8% from 2022 to 2031.To be fair, certain areas of Brookfield’s financials could use improvement. For example, its debt-to-equity ratio clocks in at 0.75x, unfavorably higher than the sector median of 0.25x. As well, its cash-to-debt ratio is only 0.85x. However, the company enjoys a net margin of 9.14%, beating out nearly 65% of its peers. Also, BNRE trades at only 3.73x operating cash flow, well beneath the sector median 7.92x.World Kinect (WKC)hands at desk near laptop computer, with one hand holding a pile of hundred dollar bills. Bank stocksSource: shutterstock.com/CC7An energy, commodities and services firm, World Kinect (NYSE:WKC) operates in the natural gas and power spheres, per its public profile. However, it primarily focuses on the marketing, trading, and financing of aviation, marine, building and ground transportation energy commodities and related services. Thanks to its wide relevance, WKC ranks among the under-the-radar stocks to buy.Unfortunately, WKC gets lost in the noise, with the market not appreciating the opportunity. To be sure, the company could use some improvements in its financials. For example, its cash balance relative to debt is rather modest, ranking worse than 60% of its peers. Still, the volatility impacting WKC – down over 17% since the Jan. opener and down nearly 23% in the past 365 days – seems a bit excessive.After all, World Kinect features a three-year revenue growth rate of 19.4%, above 69.71% of sector rivals. Even with that performance, WKC trades at only 0.03x sales, which is practically subterranean. As a speculative bet among stocks to buy, it’s worth looking into.VerifyMe (VRME)Stocks to buy: smartphone with the words ""buy"" and ""sell"" displayed on the screen. The user's finger is about to press buy. Stock charts are in the background of the image. Momentum StocksSource: Chompoo Suriyo / Shutterstock.comUndeniably the riskiest idea for under-the-radar stocks to buy on this list, VerifyMe (NASDAQ:VRME) runs largely on its underlying narrative. However, it’s an exceptionally compelling one. Through its advanced brand protection platform, VerifyMe combines overt and covert technologies to limit and thwart the most sophisticated counterfeiting techniques. While it might not be the most popular topic, this nefarious activity is a critical one to address.According to the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, counterfeit products cost the global economy over $500 billion a year. Further, with the rise in property crime negatively impacting companies both large and small, any effort to help the business community may go a long way. Naturally, this framework sounds appealing for VRME. However, over the past five years, shares stumbled 93%.Financially, investment data aggregator Gurufocus warns its readers that VerifyMe could be a possible value trap. Certainly, it has a long way to consistent profitability. Still, for speculators wanting to take a potshot, this could be one of the stocks to buy.On the date of publication, Josh Enomoto did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.A former senior business analyst for Sony Electronics, Josh Enomoto has helped broker major contracts with Fortune Global 500 companies.

You can skip our detailed analysis of the global alcohol industry, and the opportunities for non-alcoholic beverages in countries with a low prevalence of alcohol, and go directly to 5 Countries with the Highest Percentage of Non-Drinkers. Globally, an estimated 35% of men are non-drinkers, while the rate for women is 55%. Alcohol has been outlawed in several countries today, in part or as a whole. All of these countries have a majority Muslim population and have governments that adhere to some form of Islamic law, known as Sharia. In the Islamic religion, two of the most significant prohibitions are eating pork and drinking alcohol. There are about 14 countries that have outlawed alcohol to some degree. The Global Alcohol Industry:In 2019, the global alcohol consumption, measured in liters of pure alcohol per person of 15 years of age or older, was 5.5 liters, which is a 4.7% relative decrease from 5.7 liters in 2010. As we mentioned in our article – Top 20 Alcohol Drinking Countries in the World – the global alcoholic beverages market size was valued at $1.62 trillion in 2021, and the market is projected to reach $2 trillion by 2031, with a CAGR of 2.2% in the forecast period concluding in 2031.Opportunities for Non-Alcoholic Beverages: The low prevalence of alcohol in several Muslim-majority countries leads people to look elsewhere to quench their thirst, presenting opportunities to other non-alcoholic drinks. While the low- and no-alcohol trend is taking off in the Western world, another region which holds opportunities for this sector is the Middle East, where alcohol is banned in many countries. In 2019, Saudi Arabia was recorded to have the sixth-largest global market for alcohol-free beer consumption. Several booze companies have hopped on the zero-alcohol bandwagon, and are now offering products with all of the taste and none of the booze. Budweiser Zero was launched in 2020 by Anheuser-Busch InBev SA/NV (NYSE:BUD) as the company’s first non-alcoholic beer, setting itself up as the industry standard. Anheuser-Busch InBev SA/NV (NYSE:BUD) also reportedly bought the rights to supply the FIFA World Cup for $75 million exclusively last year. Story continuesAs the sale of alcohol is strictly controlled in Qatar, Bud Zero ended up being the only brew available at the stadiums during the whole event. Last month, Anheuser-Busch InBev SA/NV (NYSE:BUD) announced plans to invest $34 million in its Belgian breweries to help expand its portfolio of non-alcoholic beers, improve bottling capacity, and optimize a new non-alcoholic system used to make Corona Cero. Anheuser-Busch InBev SA/NV (NYSE:BUD) is the Largest Beer Producer in the World but the company is facing some headwinds in the American market after the recent controversy regarding its best-selling brand Bud Light, which resulted in the iconic brand losing its crown as the Top-Selling Beer in America. Although, as we mentioned in our article – 20 Countries that Drink the Most Beer per Capita – billionaire Bill Gates’ portfolio managers decided to initiate a $96 million position in the firm during the second quarter. Broyhill Asset Management said the following about Anheuser-Busch InBev SA/NV (NYSE:BUD) in its second quarter 2023 investor letter:“The largest detractors to performance over the quarter were First Horizon Corp (FHN), Anheuser-Busch InBev SA/NV (NYSE:BUD), and Bayer (BAYRY). Problems at Anheuser Busch InBev began on April 1 with Dylan Mulvaney’s social media post, which ignited a fiery backlash amongst Bud Light customers across ‘Merica. With volumes down sharply, and competitors gaining share at BUD’s expense, operational deleveraging is set to weigh heavily on US margins amid peak demand pressure in the second quarter. Despite severe US headwinds (second-quarter operating profit maybe half of last year’s levels), we still expect BUD to grow consolidated operating profit at a mid-single-digit rate for the full year. With current issues well understood and investor sentiment in the gutters, we see significant upside in a stock, which is approaching a double-digit FCF yield. With FX headwinds and rising input costs reversing course, increasing margins are likely to drive positive surprises into FY24 as continued deleveraging accrues more value to shareholders.”Saudi Arabia also leads the Middle Eastern market in terms of its consumption of drinks from the The Coca Cola Company (NYSE:KO), with Palestine not far behind. The Coca Cola Company (NYSE:KO)'s dominance in the Saudi Market is also due, in part, to the company's focus on product innovation and customer-oriented marketing. Over the past few years, the company has been investing heavily in new packaging that allows customers to customize their drinks to their taste preferences. The Coca Cola Company (NYSE:KO) now represents nearly 40% of all carbonated soft drink sales in the Middle East.Sales of PepsiCo, Inc. (NASDAQ:PEP) have traditionally been stronger in the Middle East, due, in part, to an Arab league-imposed boycott on Coca-Cola, which began when the firm decided in 1968 to open a bottling plant in Israel. PepsiCo, Inc. (NASDAQ:PEP) has been focusing on innovation and sustainability in its operations in the region – the company introduced the 'Dawah' bottle in the Middle East to recycle 88% of the water used in its production process. PepsiCo, Inc. (NASDAQ:PEP) also introduced a new beverage package in the Saudi market that is easier to use, recyclable, and doesn't require any water to consume. Similarly, the energy drinks market in the Middle East is one of the most promising in the coming years. It is true that during the pandemic, sales volumes dropped considerably due to restrictions. However, a slight recovery can be observed from 2021 onwards, reaching 859 million liters in sales during the year, and expected to increase to 100 million liters by 2026. Monster Beverage Corporation (NASDAQ:MNST) is a popular name in the Middle East, with the company boasting a 6.5% share in the regional market. Following the health-conscious approach of many countries – including in the Middle East – to reduce obesity, Monster Beverage Corporation (NASDAQ:MNST) announced the launch of Monster Energy Zero Sugar earlier this year. According to the company, Monster Beverage Corporation (NASDAQ:MNST)’s team of scientists have concocted what is 100% Monster and 0% sugar. Primed with 160 mg of caffeine – like its predecessor – Monster Energy Zero Sugar helps fight fatigue, and improve mental performance and focus. With that said, here are the Countries with the Highest Proportion of Non-Drinkers. 17 Countries with the Highest Percentage of Non-DrinkersPixabay/Public DomainMethodology:To collect data for this article, we have referred to the Global Health Observatory of the World Health Organization, looking for Countries with the Highest Percentage of Lifetime Alcohol Abstainers. Lifetime abstinence is defined as the proportion of adults (15+ years) in a given population who have not consumed any alcohol during their lifetime. If you also wish to read about countries with the highest rate of alcohol-use disorder, here are the 20 Countries with Highest Rates of Alcoholism. 17. ComorosPercentage of Non-Drinkers: 93.3%The Comoros is a volcanic archipelago off Africa’s east coast, in the warm Indian Ocean waters of the Mozambique channel. Although alcoholic beverages are available in certain parts of the country (notably the large Volo-Volo market in the national capital Moroni), the public consumption of alcohol is generally frowned upon in the islands, as over 95% of the country’s population are devout Sunni Muslims. Alcohol is also served in a few bars and restaurants though they tend to be expensive. 16. Saudi ArabiaPercentage of Non-Drinkers: 93.4%It should come as no surprise that alcohol is not exactly the most popular drink in the birthplace of Islam. Alcohol consumption, import, brewing, and selling is completely banned in Saudi Arabia. However, non-alcoholic beer, wine, and spirits are gaining traction in the Middle Eastern country, in part due to an increasingly well-traveled consumer base. Saudi Champagne – a mix of fruit and soda water that can easily be made at home – is a popular drink in the country. 15. AlgeriaPercentage of Non-Drinkers: 93.5%Due to strong conservative Islamic beliefs, alcoholic consumption is frowned upon throughout most of North Africa. Nevertheless, large exceptions are made for visiting tourists. If you wish to drink alcohol in Algeria, there are some options to drink in restaurants, bars, hotels, and private homes. However, it’s still illegal to drink publicly in the country. Beer is the most popular alcoholic beverage in Algeria, accounting for 57% of the recorded alcohol consumption. Algeria ranks among the countries with the highest rate of alcohol abstinence. 14. IraqPercentage of Non-Drinkers: 93.8%Iraqi attitudes towards alcohol have certainly had their ups and downs, from the relative ease of availability and acceptance in society in the mid-20th century to the Iraqi Parliament’s decision to outright ban the bottle in 2016. In February, the Iraqi government published the long-proposed legislation banning the import of alcoholic beverages into the country, no doubt including Saddam’s beloved Johnny Walker Black Label. 13. JordanPercentage of Non-Drinkers: 93.9%Although public displays of drunkenness are frowned upon, drinking alcohol in Jordan is accepted as long as it is done in moderation. Some restaurants will serve alcoholic beverages and there are a number of bars in Amman. Amstel – owned by Heineken N.V. – remains the most consumed beer in the country with a 90% Muslim population. 12. EgyptPercentage of Non-Drinkers: 94.3%As Egypt is a majority Muslim country, many locals abstain from alcohol completely. However, it is possible to find liquor stores and bars in some upmarket neighborhoods, and many hotels and resorts serve alcohol. Beer is the most popular beverage in the North African country, accounting for 54% of all alcohol consumption. Stella Lager – owned by Heineken N.V. since 2002 – is the most popular beer brand in Egypt. Egypt ranks 12th among countries with the highest percentage of non-drinkers. 11. Morocco Percentage of Non-Drinkers: 94.6%The general act of consuming alcohol is not illegal in Morocco and you can find all sorts of alcoholic beverages all over the country. They even produce their own beers, wines, and liquors. However, where and how you consume alcohol is what lawmakers and their enforcers care about. According to the ‘2021 Financial Law Implementation’ report, Morocco had collected a total of $86 million from import taxes on alcohol and wine, while the import taxes on beer accumulated $106 million for the national kitty. 10. SudanPercentage of Non-Drinkers: 95.2%For several decades, locally made alcoholic beverages and locally cultivated cannabis have been the two main substances of use among certain groups in Sudan. Alcohol, although it has been prohibited by Sharia laws since 1983, is still illicitly used in many parts of the country. However, in 2020, Sudan legalized the consumption of alcohol by non-Muslims, which make up 3% of the north African country’s total population. Sudan ranks among the top 10 countries with the highest percentage of people who don’t drink alcohol. 9. IranPercentage of Non-Drinkers: 96%Alcohol has been illegal for Muslim Iranian citizens since the establishment of the Islamic Republic government in 1979. Most consumers drink homemade alcoholic beverages in the country. However, the strong public demand benefits the illegal multibillion-dollar business of importing alcoholic beverages and facilitating their production inside Iran. 8. PakistanPercentage of Non-Drinkers: 96.5%Alcohol is largely prohibited for Muslims in Pakistan, but this doesn’t stop a black market from ensuring the supply of illicit liquor. Murree Brewery Company Limited – Pakistan’s largest and oldest producer of alcoholic products – is one of the most successful companies on the Pakistan Stock Exchange. Due to the social stigma it faces in the country, the brewery does not advertise and keeps a low profile. However, during the height of the pandemic, the company was able to somewhat improve its public image by producing 10,000 gallons of ethanol-based hand sanitizer. Pakistan ranks 8th in our list of countries with the highest percentage of non-drinkers.7. Solomon IslandsPercentage of Non-Drinkers: 97.1%In the Solomon Islands, illegal liquor known as Kwaso is distilled and widely consumed. It is often of low quality and is thought to have caused death, blindness, and several health problems. 6. SyriaPercentage of Non-Drinkers: 97.7%Alcohol is not banned in Syria as it is in some Muslim countries. Nor is it reserved for the upper class elite or religious minorities. Syria’s constitution uses Islamic jurisprudence as a primary source of law, but the Baathist regime has kept alcohol legal, available, and cheap.The Middle Eastern country has long produced its own alcoholic beverages, from beer to wine to the anise-based Arak. The leading brands in the Syrian beer market are Almaza, Heineken, and Al-Rayess. Syria ranks 6th among countries with the highest percentage of alcohol abstainers. Click to continue reading and see the 5 Countries with the Highest Percentage of Non-Drinkers. Suggested Articles:Vodka Consumption by Country: Top 20 Countries Top 20 Oldest Breweries in America20 Cities with the Most Bars per Capita in the WorldDisclosure: None. 17 Countries with the Highest Percentage of Non-Drinkers is originally published on Insider Monkey.]"

Partners head for the exits. A leader faces scrutiny.This is Goldman Sachs (GS) in 2023.But it was also Goldman Sachs in 1994, when surging rates from the Federal Reserve sent bond prices tumbling. An unexpected resignation of the top boss created a leadership crisis that would roil Goldman through the end of the decade.The current uproar surrounding Goldman CEO David Solomon is nothing new for a storied Wall Street firm that has wrestled with one crisis after another in the firm’s 154 years.Goldman Sachs CEO David Solomon at the firm's investor day in February. (Brendan McDermid/REUTERS) (Brendan McDermid / reuters)One boss died from a stroke while on the job, while another was ousted following a disastrous investment. A third left as the result of a bad relationship with a key deputy and a boardroom coup.Solomon, who took over nearly five years ago, now takes his place as the latest chief to go under an extreme microscope after reporting the firm's lowest quarterly profits in three years. He is wrestling with everything from job cuts and a global investment banking slump to reports of partner unrest.Goldman’s stock is down 7% so far this year. It has outperformed Bank of America (BAC) and Citigroup (C) while underperforming Morgan Stanley (MS) and JPMorgan Chase (JPM). The KBW Nasdaq US bank index (^BKX) is down 21% for the same period.Since Solomon became CEO in October 2018, Goldman's stock is up 43%. That is better than all Wall Street rivals except Morgan Stanley. The KBW index has fallen 24% over the same time.It is too early to know whether the CEO and Goldman can convince investors (and partners) that the company is on the right path. Solomon is attempting a tricky retreat from a costly push into consumer banking while also waiting out a tepid stretch of dealmaking.""What I would expect and suggest is that 2023 is a lost year for Goldman Sachs,"" said Gerard Cassidy, a banking analyst with RBC Capital Markets. “Whether they do it in the third or fourth quarter, they need to clear the decks for any more write-offs or additional problems.""Story continuesAuthor William Cohan, who wrote a 2011 book about Goldman titled ""Money and Power,"" said ""if the third quarter isn’t better than the second, it could be trouble.""Here is a closer look at how past crises tested the top ranks of Goldman:1994The turmoil that began in 1994 is perhaps the closest parallel to now. Rising rates from the Fed starting in February of that year sent bond prices plunging, triggering trading losses of more than $100 million a month for Goldman, according to Cohan's book. At the time it was a private firm still owned by its partners.Some of those partners began heading for the door. ""Almost everybody I know at Goldman is grumbling,"" one executive told The New York Times that year. ""Everybody was freaking out then,"" Cohan said.Goldman in its own corporate history described 1994 as ""a year of challenge and change,"" citing severe downturns in bond and currency markets that created losses in its J. Aron and fixed income divisions.""In the wake of these losses, the firm saw an unusually large number of partners retire, taking their capital along with them.""Stephen Friedman, left, with President George W. Bush in 2002, long after Friedman had left the top job at Goldman. (William Philpott/REUTERS) (Reuters Photographer / reuters)Then at a partner meeting in September 1994, Goldman boss Stephen Friedman surprised other senior bankers and much of the industry with an announcement that he would be retiring as head of the firm without a clear succession plan in place, according to Cohan's book.Friedman declined to comment on the matter.He and the management committee chose Jon Corzine and Henry Paulson to succeed him later that year — but not as equals. Corzine would be CEO and Paulson would be his deputy, as COO.1999There was one big problem with the new leadership structure at Goldman. Corzine and Paulson didn't get along.Corzine and Paulson got through the losses of 1994 by cutting costs, including 1,000 employees. Profits dropped 80% for the year, and 40 senior executives left, according to a regulatory filing in 1995. By the second half of 1995 the business had turned around.Jon Corzine, pictured in 2010, after he had left Goldman and won election as New Jersey's governor. (Rich Schultz/AP Photo, File) (ASSOCIATED PRESS)But in the latter part of the decade Paulson became increasingly irritated by Corzine's overtures to other firms, including JPMorgan, according to Cohan's book.The breaking point was when Paulson caught word of discussions Corzine had with the head of Mellon Bank in Pittsburgh.Management committee members were irate, according to Cohan's book, and prevented Corzine from having any such discussions in the future, handing that responsibility to Paulson. Paulson threatened to leave if Corzine remained in charge, and a majority of committee members asked that Paulson take over.Henry Paulson, who took over as Goldman's top boss in 1999. He later became treasury secretary for President George W. Bush. (Brooks Kraft LLC/Corbis via Getty Images) (Brooks Kraft via Getty Images)In 1998 they started sharing power, but that didn’t last long. In January 1999 came the surprise announcement that Corzine would be leaving and handing full control to Paulson.​​""The biggest single factor here is that the two guys really did not get along with each other,"" one anonymous partner told The New York Times after Corzine's exit that year. ""Hank and Jon are not friends.""Both Corzine and Paulson declined to comment on their time at Goldman Sachs.1929The most existential threat to Goldman's existence came during a calamitous stock market downturn that roiled the US economy and ushered in the Great Depression.The ""great crash"" in 1929 crushed a Goldman investment trust that had pooled investors’ capital in order to invest in stock, called the Goldman Sachs Trading Corporation (GSTC), that had 42,000 shareholders.GSTC had been created the year before by Waddill Catchings, a risk-taking executive from Tennessee who had become the first senior partner outside of the Goldman or Sachs families.Waddill Catchings, left, with Robert Healy of the Securities Exchange Commission in 1937. (Herbert K. White/AP Photo) (ASSOCIATED PRESS)The stock of GSTC, which had peaked at $326, plummeted to $1.75 a share in October 1929.""It could have ended Goldman Sachs right then and there,"" John Rogers, a chief of staff to four Goldman CEOs, said in a video Goldman produced for its 150th anniversary.The other partners decided Catchings should leave in 1930. During a Securities and Exchange Commission hearing seven years later, Catchings said GSTC lost $289 million between 1928 and 1932. That would be $5.1 billion today when adjusted for inflation.1976Tragedy struck the corner office in 1976 when senior partner Gus Levy had a stroke and died while at a meeting.When it happened, there were no plans in place for a successor.Gus Levy pictured when he was senior partner of Goldman. (Bettmann Archive) (Bettmann via Getty Images)Reuters reported in 2014 that Levy had left a note in the drawer of his desk saying that John Whitehead and John Weinberg should be named as co-senior partners if something were to happen to him. But Whitehead told Reuters he never saw the letter. He and Weinberg, he told Reuters, proposed that they take over and share power equally.“It was a very short period of people not knowing,” Whitehead told Reuters.2008A severe downturn in 2008 triggered by the collapse of the US housing market created a type of crisis that Goldman's leaders hadn't experienced in decades: political blowback.The reason: eye-popping profits.While it did lose $2 billion in the final quarter of 2008, its first loss since going public in 1999, Goldman earned a then-record $13.4 billion in 2009 while many of its rivals still struggled. It also received billions in aid from the US government, as many banks did, to get through the period.The next year it found itself at the center of a firestorm in Washington as the SEC sued it for fraud, alleging that the firm misled investors about a complex security linked to the mortgage market.Goldman Sachs CEO Lloyd Blankfein is sworn in prior to testifying before a Senate committee on April 27, 2010. (JIM WATSON/AFP via Getty Images) (JIM WATSON via Getty Images)The scrutiny led to fireworks before a Senate committee in 2010, where CEO Lloyd Blankfein defended the firm against accusations that it didn't disclose enough to its clients.""And you want people to trust you?"" Senator Carl Levin said to Blankfein, who answered: ""Senator, I think people do trust us.""""Why, I wouldn't trust you,"" Levin added.Blankfein survived that scrutiny and handed the reins to Solomon in 2018. The New York Times reported that Blankfein, in a June 2023 phone call with Solomon, offered advice and even to return to Goldman in some capacity.Three days after the article appeared, Blankfein told CNBC that he had been ""misquoted"" and that he couldn't see himself going back to Goldman.""My conversation with him was, I offered to be helpful,"" Blankfein told CNBC.

Since the market usually pay for a company’s long-term fundamentals, we decided to study the company’s key performance indicators to see if they could be influencing the market. In this article, we decided to focus on TJX Companies'  ROE.ROE or return on equity is a useful tool to assess how effectively a company can generate returns on the investment it received from its shareholders. In other words, it is a profitability ratio which measures the rate of return on the capital provided by the company's shareholders. See our latest analysis for TJX Companies How Is ROE Calculated?The formula for ROE is:Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' EquitySo, based on the above formula, the ROE for TJX Companies is:60% = US$4.0b ÷ US$6.6b (Based on the trailing twelve months to July 2023).The 'return' is the amount earned after tax over the last twelve months. Another way to think of that is that for every $1 worth of equity, the company was able to earn $0.60 in profit.What Has ROE Got To Do With Earnings Growth?We have already established that ROE serves as an efficient profit-generating gauge for a company's future earnings. We now need to evaluate how much profit the company reinvests or ""retains"" for future growth which then gives us an idea about the growth potential of the company. Assuming all else is equal, companies that have both a higher return on equity and higher profit retention are usually the ones that have a higher growth rate when compared to companies that don't have the same features.TJX Companies' Earnings Growth And 60% ROEFirst thing first, we like that TJX Companies has an impressive ROE. Second, a comparison with the average ROE reported by the industry of 20% also doesn't go unnoticed by us. Probably as a result of this, TJX Companies was able to see a decent net income growth of 6.3% over the last five years.Story continuesAs a next step, we compared TJX Companies' net income growth with the industry and were disappointed to see that the company's growth is lower than the industry average growth of 26% in the same period.past-earnings-growthEarnings growth is a huge factor in stock valuation. What investors need to determine next is if the expected earnings growth, or the lack of it, is already built into the share price. This then helps them determine if the stock is placed for a bright or bleak future. Has the market priced in the future outlook for TJX? You can find out in our latest intrinsic value infographic research report. Is TJX Companies Efficiently Re-investing Its Profits?TJX Companies has a three-year median payout ratio of 39%, which implies that it retains the remaining 61% of its profits. This suggests that its dividend is well covered, and given the decent growth seen by the company, it looks like management is reinvesting its earnings efficiently.Besides, TJX Companies has been paying dividends for at least ten years or more. This shows that the company is committed to sharing profits with its shareholders. Based on the latest analysts' estimates, we found that the company's future payout ratio over the next three years is expected to hold steady at 37%. Accordingly, forecasts suggest that TJX Companies' future ROE will be 62% which is again, similar to the current ROE.ConclusionOn the whole, we feel that TJX Companies' performance has been quite good. Specifically, we like that the company is reinvesting a huge chunk of its profits at a high rate of return. This of course has caused the company to see a good amount of growth in its earnings. That being so, the latest analyst forecasts show that the company will continue to see an expansion in its earnings.

In the off-treatment extension period, olpasiran showed a lasting effect on Lp(a) reduction nearly a year after the last dose.Results from the OCEAN(a)-DOSE Phase 2 study announced in November of 2022 showed that doses of olpasiran ≥75 mg Q12W reduced patients' Lp(a) by &gt;95% at week 36. The results from the off-treatment extension period show that patients previously dosed with ≥75 mg of olpasiran sustained a ~40-50% placebo-adjusted percent reduction in Lp(a) nearly a year after the last dose. No new safety concerns were identified during the off-treatment extension period.""We are dedicated to reducing LDL cholesterol levels in people globally and continuing to pioneer ways to address the greatest risk factors in cardiovascular disease, including Lp(a). Worldwide, millions of people are at an increased risk of cardiovascular events due to elevated Lp(a) levels. Unfortunately, there are no approved medicines,"" said Paul Burton, senior vice president and chief medical officer at Amgen. ""Data from the off-treatment extension period provide additional evidence of olpasiran's lasting effect in reducing Lp(a) levels. We are quickly advancing the Phase 3 cardiovascular outcome trial.""Additionally, this study was the first to explore the effects of olpasiran on a key biomarker strongly associated with atherosclerosis, pro-atherogenic OxPL-apoB [Oxidized Phospholipids (Ox-PL) on apoB-100 (apoB)]. During the treatment period, olpasiran showed a dose-dependent reduction in pro-atherogenic OxPL-apoB.Story continues""Additional results from the OCEAN(a)-DOSE study continue to be encouraging, as they tell us olpasiran not only robustly reduces Lp(a) levels, but that it has a long-lasting effect on this important risk factor for ASCVD,"" said Michelle L. O'Donoghue, MD, MPH, associate professor, Harvard Medical School, Cardiovascular Medicine and lead investigator of the OCEAN(a)-DOSE study. ""Additionally, we were able to show that olpasiran reduced OxPL-apoB, further adding to the potential of RNA interference with olpasiran as a promising treatment approach to reducing elevated Lp(a).""LDL Awareness to Action Implementation ConsortiumAmgen is committed to working with stakeholders to achieve the goal of reducing cardiovascular disease globally and, this year at ESC, convened a new LDL Awareness to Action Implementation Consortium (LATAIC). LATAIC is focused on improving LDL-C testing and evidence-based treatment through identification of opportunities to accelerate efficiency and impact of the translation of evidence-based research into clinical practice. The consortium is comprised of leading CV institutions, including Duke, Harvard's BAIM Institute, Johns Hopkins, Geisinger, University of Colorado, St. Luke's, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Providence, Yale and UT Southwestern.""I am proud to be working alongside Amgen and other cross disciplinary leaders in the cardiovascular space to increase LDL-C testing and implementation of evidence-based treatment, in order to tackle the urgent public health crisis of cardiovascular disease,"" said C. Michael Gibson, M.D., chief executive officer at the non-profit BAIM Institute of Clinical Research, and professor of medicine, Harvard.

Although an agreed-upon threshold for elevated Lp(a) is not firmly established, approximately 20% of adults have Lp(a) &gt;125 nmol/L (or approximately 50 mg/dL).3,4 Evidence has emerged from pathophysiological, epidemiologic, and genetic studies on the potential role of elevated Lp(a) in contributing to myocardial infarction, stroke, and peripheral arterial disease.5About OCEAN(a)The OCEAN(a) (Olpasiran Trials of Cardiovascular Events And LipoproteiN(a) Reduction) clinical program for Amgen's investigational olpasiran is designed to treat patients with atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) and elevated Lp(a) levels to reduce the risk of cardiovascular events. The OCEAN(a)-DOSE trial is a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled dose-finding Phase 2 study in 281 patients with ASCVD and Lp(a) &gt;150 nmol/L. Patients were randomly assigned to one of four active subcutaneous doses of olpasiran (10 mg Q12 weeks, 75 mg Q12 weeks, 225 mg Q12 weeks or 225 mg Q24 weeks) or placebo. The primary endpoint is percent change from baseline in Lp(a) at 36 weeks. A secondary endpoint is percent change from baseline in Lp(a) at 48 weeks. For the off-treatment extension period, patients were followed for a minimum of 24 weeks. A biomarker discovery analysis was performed on the percent change from baseline in OxPL-apoB [Oxidized Phospholipids (Ox-PL) on apoB-100 (apoB)] at weeks 36 and 48.About Amgen Amgen is committed to unlocking the potential of biology for patients suffering from serious illnesses by discovering, developing, manufacturing and delivering innovative human therapeutics.

All statements, other than statements of historical fact, are statements that could be deemed forward-looking statements, including any statements on the outcome, benefits and synergies of collaborations, or potential collaborations, with any other company (including BeiGene, Ltd. or Kyowa-Kirin Co., Ltd.), the performance of Otezla® (apremilast) (including anticipated Otezla sales growth and the timing of non-GAAP EPS accretion), the Teneobio, Inc. acquisition, the ChemoCentryx, Inc. acquisition, or the proposed acquisition of Horizon Therapeutics plc (including the potential outcome of any litigation with the Federal Trade Commission, prospective performance and outlook of Horizon's business, performance and opportunities and any potential strategic benefits, synergies or opportunities expected as a result of such acquisition), as well as estimates of revenues, operating margins, capital expenditures, cash, other financial metrics, expected legal, arbitration, political, regulatory or clinical results or practices, customer and prescriber patterns or practices, reimbursement activities and outcomes, effects of pandemics or other widespread health problems on our business, outcomes, progress, and other such estimates and results. Forward-looking statements involve significant risks and uncertainties, including those discussed below and more fully described in the Securities and Exchange Commission reports filed by Amgen, including our most recent annual report on Form 10-K and any subsequent periodic reports on Form 10-Q and current reports on Form 8-K. Unless otherwise noted, Amgen is providing this information as of the date of this news release and does not undertake any obligation to update any forward-looking statements contained in this document as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.No forward-looking statement can be guaranteed and actual results may differ materially from those we project. Discovery or identification of new product candidates or development of new indications for existing products cannot be guaranteed and movement from concept to product is uncertain; consequently, there can be no guarantee that any particular product candidate or development of a new indication for an existing product will be successful and become a commercial product. Further, preclinical results do not guarantee safe and effective performance of product candidates in humans. The complexity of the human body cannot be perfectly, or sometimes, even adequately modeled by computer or cell culture systems or animal models. The length of time that it takes for us to complete clinical trials and obtain regulatory approval for product marketing has in the past varied and we expect similar variability in the future. Even when clinical trials are successful, regulatory authorities may question the sufficiency for approval of the trial endpoints we have selected. We develop product candidates internally and through licensing collaborations, partnerships and joint ventures. Product candidates that are derived from relationships may be subject to disputes between the parties or may prove to be not as effective or as safe as we may have believed at the time of entering into such relationship. Also, we or others could identify safety, side effects or manufacturing problems with our products, including our devices, after they are on the market.Our results may be affected by our ability to successfully market both new and existing products domestically and internationally, clinical and regulatory developments involving current and future products, sales growth of recently launched products, competition from other products including biosimilars, difficulties or delays in manufacturing our products and global economic conditions. In addition, sales of our products are affected by pricing pressure, political and public scrutiny and reimbursement policies imposed by third-party payers, including governments, private insurance plans and managed care providers and may be affected by regulatory, clinical and guideline developments and domestic and international trends toward managed care and healthcare cost containment. Furthermore, our research, testing, pricing, marketing and other operations are subject to extensive regulation by domestic and foreign government regulatory authorities. Our business may be impacted by government investigations, litigation and product liability claims. In addition, our business may be impacted by the adoption of new tax legislation or exposure to additional tax liabilities. If we fail to meet the compliance obligations in the corporate integrity agreement between us and the U.S. government, we could become subject to significant sanctions. Further, while we routinely obtain patents for our products and technology, the protection offered by our patents and patent applications may be challenged, invalidated or circumvented by our competitors, or we may fail to prevail in present and future intellectual property litigation. We perform a substantial amount of our commercial manufacturing activities at a few key facilities, including in Puerto Rico, and also depend on third parties for a portion of our manufacturing activities, and limits on supply may constrain sales of certain of our current products and product candidate development. An outbreak of disease or similar public health threat, such as COVID-19, and the public and governmental effort to mitigate against the spread of such disease, could have a significant adverse effect on the supply of materials for our manufacturing activities, the distribution of our products, the commercialization of our product candidates, and our clinical trial operations, and any such events may have a material adverse effect on our product development, product sales, business and results of operations. We rely on collaborations with third parties for the development of some of our product candidates and for the commercialization and sales of some of our commercial products. In addition, we compete with other companies with respect to many of our marketed products as well as for the discovery and development of new products. Further, some raw materials, medical devices and component parts for our products are supplied by sole third-party suppliers. Certain of our distributors, customers and payers have substantial purchasing leverage in their dealings with us. The discovery of significant problems with a product similar to one of our products that implicate an entire class of products could have a material adverse effect on sales of the affected products and on our business and results of operations. Our efforts to collaborate with or acquire other companies, products or technology, and to integrate the operations of companies or to support the products or technology we have acquired, may not be successful. There can be no guarantee that we will be able to realize any of the strategic benefits, synergies or opportunities arising from the Horizon acquisition, and such benefits, synergies or opportunities may take longer to realize than expected.  We may not obtain regulatory clearance to acquire Horizon or be able to successfully integrate Horizon, and such acquisition or integration may take longer, be more difficult or cost more than expected. A breakdown, cyberattack or information security breach of our information technology systems could compromise the confidentiality, integrity and availability of our systems and our data. Our stock price is volatile and may be affected by a number of events. Our business and operations may be negatively affected by the failure, or perceived failure, of achieving our environmental, social and governance objectives. The effects of global climate change and related natural disasters could negatively affect our business and operations. Global economic conditions may magnify certain risks that affect our business. Our business performance could affect or limit the ability of our Board of Directors to declare a dividend or our ability to pay a dividend or repurchase our common stock. We may not be able to access the capital and credit markets on terms that are favorable to us, or at all.Any scientific information discussed in this news release relating to new indications for our products is preliminary and investigative and is not part of the labeling approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for the products.

Businesses buy more materials when the outlook for growth is most favorable, making materials stocks attractive at those points. I wouldn’t characterize the economy as “strong”, currently but the global growth forecast has improved over the last few months.That implies that demand for materials is set to tick upward in the near term setting up a favorable scenario in the materials sector. Thus, identifying undervalued materials firms makes the potential returns even greater. If the global economy has indeed avoided a recession or if we’re actually moving out of one then these stocks will reward investors accordingly.Rio Tinto (RIO) A pile of iron ore granules on a black background.Source: ShutterstockRio Tinto (NYSE:RIO) provides materials investors with a great deal of general exposure. The stock covers a wide range of materials from iron, copper and aluminum to diamonds, energy and other minerals. Rio Tinto employs more than 50,000 workers who are tasked with bringing those materials to market. In short, RIO stock is well-positioned to seize the general opportunity as the economy enters its next phase.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsBasically, Rio Tinto appears to be positioning itself for an upswing in materials demand. The company’s sales volume increased by 5% through the first half of 2023 relative to the same period a year prior. In short, it’s pushing more products through its pipeline in anticipation that prices will rebound. Those prices have fallen during that same period resulting in 33% lower sales during H1 ‘23.The company is making a push in the iron ore sector and marketing those efforts in its earnings report. That suggests the company sees a resurgence in overall building demand. RIO shares have roughly 33% upside based on target prices.Corteva (CTVA)A Corteva (CTVA) sign in Indianapolis, Indiana.Source: Jonathan Weiss / ShutterstockCorteva (NYSE:CTVA) is an agriscience stock that remains undervalued at the moment following continued flatness across the business. That flatness has resulted in shares falling to levels well below where Wall Street believes it should trade. Add in Corteva’s modest dividend and it becomes apparent that investors who buy in now could see strong returns in the near future.Story continuesCorteva has basically shifted its sales mix in the first half which has resulted in overall sales increasing by 1% and -3% in H1 and Q2, respectively. Corteva has had to sell a greater volume of seeds while crop protection sales decline in order to tread water essentially. That has resulted in investors selling CTVA stock and prices declining. Sales increased overall throughout North America which is Corteva’s largest market by far. However, declines across Latin America, EMEA and Asia were significant enough to lower overall sales. The firm expects revenue, EBITDA and EPS figures to all increase during 2023 suggesting now is the time to invest in this materials stock.Newmont Mining (NEM) A pile of shining gold bars. Gold stocksSource: ShutterstockNewmont Mining (NYSE:NEM) is a cheap gold stock with a few reasonable narratives supporting it as an investment.First of all, NEM shares are relatively inexpensive right now, trading at around $40 with the expectation of 20% growth over the next year or so. Newmont is also the largest gold miner globally based on 2022 production.Anyway, there are at least two economic outcomes that could send NEM shares higher. Gold prices will rise if the economic situation worsens due to the U.S. dollar’s credibility weakening. Although things appear better at the moment that remains a distinct possibility. On the contrary, if the economy avoids recession gold sales could rise as input demand creeps upward for end applications.Further, Newmont provides investors a buffer in the form of a dividend yielding 3.98%. Share prices are as low as they’ve been since 2019 and the dividend was last reduced in 2015. Newmont is unlikely to cause much damage to investors and has much more upside than it does downside, making it a great option for materials stocks to buy.On the date of publication, Alex Sirois did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

Knowing whether insiders are buying is usually more helpful when evaluating insider transactions, as insider selling can have various explanations. However, if numerous insiders are selling, shareholders should investigate more.While insider transactions are not the most important thing when it comes to long-term investing, logic dictates you should pay some attention to whether insiders are buying or selling shares. Check out our latest analysis for General Dynamics General Dynamics Insider Transactions Over The Last YearThe Chairperson &amp; CEO, Phebe Novakovic, made the biggest insider sale in the last 12 months. That single transaction was for US$7.6m worth of shares at a price of US$228 each. So we know that an insider sold shares at around the present share price of US$224. While we don't usually like to see insider selling, it's more concerning if the sales take place at a lower price. In this case, the big sale took place at around the current price, so it's not too bad (but it's still not a positive).All up, insiders sold more shares in General Dynamics than they bought, over the last year. You can see the insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last year depicted in the chart below.

In total, insiders sold US$12m worth of shares in that time, and we didn't record any purchases whatsoever. Overall this makes us a bit cautious, but it's not the be all and end all.Story continuesInsider OwnershipMany investors like to check how much of a company is owned by insiders. A high insider ownership often makes company leadership more mindful of shareholder interests. General Dynamics insiders own 0.6% of the company, currently worth about US$379m based on the recent share price. This kind of significant ownership by insiders does generally increase the chance that the company is run in the interest of all shareholders.So What Does This Data Suggest About General Dynamics Insiders?Insiders haven't bought General Dynamics stock in the last three months, but there was some selling. Zooming out, the longer term picture doesn't give us much comfort. But it is good to see that General Dynamics is growing earnings. While insiders do own a lot of shares in the company (which is good), our analysis of their transactions doesn't make us feel confident about the company. So while it's helpful to know what insiders are doing in terms of buying or selling, it's also helpful to know the risks that a particular company is facing. While conducting our analysis, we found that General Dynamics has 2 warning signs and it would be unwise to ignore these.Of course, you might find a fantastic investment by looking elsewhere. So take a peek at this free list of interesting companies.For the purposes of this article, insiders are those individuals who report their transactions to the relevant regulatory body. We currently account for open market transactions and private dispositions, but not derivative transactions.Have feedback on this article? Concerned about the content? Get in touch with us directly.

With this bull run showing signs of a plateau, I think it’s time to start looking for bargains in other areas of the market. In my view, we’ve hit an inflection point where market concentration is finally shifting away from mega-cap tech names. This rotation creates an opportunity to scoop up shares of high-quality companies in various sectors that have been oversold during the recent tech-focused rally.In this article, I’ll discuss seven very oversold stocks that I believe are poised for a rebound. These are strong companies with great fundamentals that have simply been caught up in the broader market sell-off. But with attention turning to value opportunities outside of tech, they now have the potential to bounce back. I see their current valuations as quite attractive for long-term investors.The key is targeting companies with healthy balance sheets, solid growth stories, and durable competitive advantages. By focusing on oversold opportunities like these, investors can position themselves to generate strong returns as the market enters a new phase. Let’s dive in!InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsAT&amp;T (T)Rack Mounted Servers In A Server Room, Server rack audio cable. Severs computer in a rack at the large data center. Fiber Optical connector interface for Cards Equipment DWDM telecommunications. KLR stockSource: Funtap / Shutterstock.comAT&amp;T (NYSE:T) has seen its stock price plummet nearly 57% from its highs in 2016 and reach levels not seen since the early 1990s. While the company has faced significant challenges with the broader telecom sector slowdown and the recent lead cables controversy, I believe the sell-off has been overdone. AT&amp;T remains a telecom giant, serving over 223 million wireless customers in the U.S. This allows the company to generate very strong cash flows, which support its very attractive 7.8% dividend yield. It’s not the most reliable yield, but AT&amp;T trades at just 6-times forward earnings, which is far too cheap for this high quality business.Simply put, T stock appears very oversold here. Analysts have an average price target of $25 on AT&amp;T, representing 42% upside from current levels. I see strong potential for AT&amp;T to bounce back as investors recognize how undervalued it is. Analysts expect steady top-and-bottom line growth of roughly 1%-1.5% annually, which should propel earnings higher over time. It isn’t a growth play by any stretch, but with a rock-solid balance sheet and durable competitive advantages, AT&amp;T is poised to deliver strong total returns from these beaten-down levels.Story continuesPayPal (PYPL)PayPal logo overlays daylight photo of corporate buildingSource: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock.comPayPal (NASDAQ:PYPL) has been caught up in the tech stock selloffs over the last two years but has yet to recover. Currently, PYPL stock remains 80% off from their highs. However, I believe this leading digital payments provider has tremendous upside potential. PayPal continues to grow revenue at a 7% clip year-over-year, driven by peer-to-peer transactions growth and its fast-growing subsidiary apps.Profitability also remains strong, supporting 16.7% operating margins. This has allowed PayPal to undertake massive share buyback programs, with the most recent one being worth $5 billion. The company’s fortress balance sheet also means there’s more growth on the horizon, with $10 billion in cash to support growth initiatives.Analysts believe PayPal can pull off ~10% growth year-over-year through 2032. Earnings per share growth expectations are also optimistic, averaging roughly 20% annually. History shows that this is a company that can easily meet those expectations. Indeed, PayPal has only missed annual revenue and EPS expectations once since 2015. It should be noted that those misses were microscopic (revenue missed by 0.06% and earnings missed by only 1 cent).Despite these projections, the stock trades at just 13-times forward earnings after its huge pullback. Yes, I do understand that account growth hasn’t been very impressive. But I still believe PayPal can reverse these trends, given enough time. And if not, it clearly has the ability to continue squeezing out decent growth and profits from its existing user base.Analysts see 38% upside in PayPal’s stock from current levels. I believe the stock could bounce back 50% or more over the next 12-18 months.Charter Communications (CHTR)The Charter Communications (CHTR) logo is displayed on a smartphone screen.Source: Piotr Swat / Shutterstock.comCharter Communications (NASDAQ:CHTR) also offers a compelling rebound opportunity as it trades at a 47% discount from its highs. As one of the largest cable and broadband providers in the U.S., Charter has an entrenched market position. The company continues growing broadband subscribers at a healthy clip, while also expanding mobile service.The company’s profitability is robust, with 23% net margins, better than 82.5% of peers. Analysts expect sustained growth, averaging 2% year-over-year annually until 2028. In terms of earnings per share, analysts believe Charter can pull off roughly 15% annual growth over that time frame. The company also has a solid balance sheet. Yet, Charter trades at just 13-times forward earnings, representing a significant discount from its intrinsic value.Analysts see just 12% upside in the stock from current levels, though this number has been dragged lower due to mixed sentiment, and one lowball price target of $325. On the other hand, Gurufocus’ model believes CHTR stock has a fair value closer to $800. Nonetheless, broadband demand continues to rise, and Charter appears primed for many years of growth ahead. The company also has pricing power and generates ample free cash flow of over $5.5 billion annually. Given Charter’s defensible market position and reasonable valuation, I view the stock as a top rebound candidate among current oversold stocks.Zoom (ZM)Zoom (ZM) logo on a buildingSource: Michael Vi / Shutterstock.comZoom (NASDAQ:ZM) has seen its stock dive over 88% from pandemic highs. However, I believe the overreaction to normalization provides an opportunity. Despite the slowdown in growth, Zoom still grew revenue by 3% year-over-year last quarter. Analysts expect this growth to slowly creep up to 11.7% in 2027. Additionally, earnings per share growth is also expected to hit double digits in 2028. Thus, I feel paying 15.6-times forward earnings right now is more than compelling.Zoom has also successfully diversified beyond video conferencing, with offerings like Zoom Phone, Rooms, Events, and many of its emerging event’s platforms. The pandemic blessed this company with a household name brand and over $5 billion in cash and no debt. Yet, the price is still the same. For investors with patience, Zoom stock appears significantly oversold here – presenting a chance to buy a high-quality business at a bargain valuation.Tyson Foods (TSN)Tyson (TSN Stock) chicken in a package.Source: rblfmr / Shutterstock.comTyson Foods (NYSE:TSN) has seen its stock fall 45% from its peak, pressured by stubborn inflation and margin pressures. However, as one of the world’s largest protein producers, I view the sell-off as overdone. Tyson holds the #1 U.S. market share in chicken, beef, and pork, giving it wide economic moats. Despite challenges tied to inflation, analysts expect sales growth to accelerate to 4% by 2027. What’s more impressive is that earnings per share are expected to climb from $1.20 this year to $9.60 by the end of 2027.Indeed, Tyson’s brand strength and multi-protein portfolio also give it pricing power to protect margins over time. It is not a cheap stock if you consider near-term metrics, but if you zoom out, Tyson appears substantially undervalued. If the company keeps up with earnings per share expectations, its price-earnings ratio drops to just 5.7-times in 2027.But again, the road to recovery here will take some patience. The stock’s dividend yield of 3.5% comes in handy while you wait.Snap Inc (SNAP)Snapchat (SNAP) application on android cell smartphone. Snapchat is a mobile messaging application used to share photos, videos, text, and drawings.Source: dennizn / Shutterstock.comSnap (NYSE:SNAP) has seen its stock absolutely decimated, with shares down more than 88% from 2021 highs. However, I believe this selloff has gone too far for this social media leader. Snap continues to rapidly grow its daily active users, with its total reaching 397 million in Q2. Revenue did decline 4% year-over-year, but is expected to deliver a 14.3% rebound in 2024 and 16.2% in 2025. That’s very strong for an advertising-dependent business amid this uncertain economic backdrop.Importantly, Snap is making some progress in improving monetization and increasing its margins. The company’s average revenue per user (ARPU) ticked up to $2.69. That’s not much compared to its peers, and this is exactly why I think Snap has huge growth potential. Snap appears incredibly cheap relative to peers and analysts expect positive net income this year with sustained high earnings per share growth through this decade. The stock could triple or even quadruple in a bull-case scenario.Match Group (MTCH)the match group (MTCH) logo displayed on a phone screen next to a heartSource: Lori Butcher / Shutterstock.comMatch Group (NASDAQ:MTCH) is another typical tech stock that fell 73% from 2021 highs, caught up in the broad selloff of technology and growth names. However, as the leading global dating app provider, Match retains tremendous long-term potential and is slowly bottoming out. The company’s top app Tinder continues growing, with 6% growth. This fueled 4% overall revenue growth for Match despite the challenging environment.Trading at just 16-times forward earnings, Match appears significantly undervalued relative to its own history. With recent trends in mind, dating app usage remains strong, and Match is successfully monetizing its users. This is a long-term play that I believe is poised to deliver.On the date of publication, Omor Ibne Ehsan did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

The ex-dividend date is usually set to be one business day before the record date which is the cut-off date on which you must be present on the company's books as a shareholder in order to receive the dividend. The ex-dividend date is of consequence because whenever a stock is bought or sold, the trade takes at least two business day to settle. Thus, you can purchase Lockheed Martin's shares before the 31st of August in order to receive the dividend, which the company will pay on the 22nd of September.The company's next dividend payment will be US$3.00 per share, on the back of last year when the company paid a total of US$12.00 to shareholders. Based on the last year's worth of payments, Lockheed Martin has a trailing yield of 2.7% on the current stock price of $451.09. If you buy this business for its dividend, you should have an idea of whether Lockheed Martin's dividend is reliable and sustainable. As a result, readers should always check whether Lockheed Martin has been able to grow its dividends, or if the dividend might be cut. View our latest analysis for Lockheed Martin If a company pays out more in dividends than it earned, then the dividend might become unsustainable - hardly an ideal situation. That's why it's good to see Lockheed Martin paying out a modest 43% of its earnings. Yet cash flow is typically more important than profit for assessing dividend sustainability, so we should always check if the company generated enough cash to afford its dividend. Dividends consumed 51% of the company's free cash flow last year, which is within a normal range for most dividend-paying organisations.It's encouraging to see that the dividend is covered by both profit and cash flow. This generally suggests the dividend is sustainable, as long as earnings don't drop precipitously.Story continuesClick here to see the company's payout ratio, plus analyst estimates of its future dividends.historic-dividendHave Earnings And Dividends Been Growing?Companies with consistently growing earnings per share generally make the best dividend stocks, as they usually find it easier to grow dividends per share. If earnings fall far enough, the company could be forced to cut its dividend. It's encouraging to see Lockheed Martin has grown its earnings rapidly, up 34% a year for the past five years.The main way most investors will assess a company's dividend prospects is by checking the historical rate of dividend growth. In the last 10 years, Lockheed Martin has lifted its dividend by approximately 10% a year on average. Both per-share earnings and dividends have both been growing rapidly in recent times, which is great to see.The Bottom LineFrom a dividend perspective, should investors buy or avoid Lockheed Martin? From a dividend perspective, we're encouraged to see that earnings per share have been growing, the company is paying out less than half of its earnings, and a bit over half its free cash flow. It's a promising combination that should mark this company worthy of closer attention.In light of that, while Lockheed Martin has an appealing dividend, it's worth knowing the risks involved with this stock. Our analysis shows 1 warning sign for Lockheed Martin and you should be aware of it before buying any shares.A common investing mistake is buying the first interesting stock you see.

(NYSE:BAX) is about to go ex-dividend in just 4 days. Typically, the ex-dividend date is one business day before the record date which is the date on which a company determines the shareholders eligible to receive a dividend. The ex-dividend date is of consequence because whenever a stock is bought or sold, the trade takes at least two business day to settle. Accordingly, Baxter International investors that purchase the stock on or after the 31st of August will not receive the dividend, which will be paid on the 2nd of October.The company's next dividend payment will be US$0.29 per share. Last year, in total, the company distributed US$1.16 to shareholders. Based on the last year's worth of payments, Baxter International has a trailing yield of 2.8% on the current stock price of $41.53. If you buy this business for its dividend, you should have an idea of whether Baxter International's dividend is reliable and sustainable. As a result, readers should always check whether Baxter International has been able to grow its dividends, or if the dividend might be cut. See our latest analysis for Baxter International If a company pays out more in dividends than it earned, then the dividend might become unsustainable - hardly an ideal situation. Baxter International's dividend is not well covered by earnings, as the company lost money last year. This is not a sustainable state of affairs, so it would be worth investigating if earnings are expected to recover. With the recent loss, it's important to check if the business generated enough cash to pay its dividend. If cash earnings don't cover the dividend, the company would have to pay dividends out of cash in the bank, or by borrowing money, neither of which is long-term sustainable. It paid out more than half (70%) of its free cash flow in the past year, which is within an average range for most companies.Story continuesClick here to see the company's payout ratio, plus analyst estimates of its future dividends.historic-dividendHave Earnings And Dividends Been Growing?When earnings decline, dividend companies become much harder to analyse and own safely. If business enters a downturn and the dividend is cut, the company could see its value fall precipitously. Baxter International reported a loss last year, and the general trend suggests its earnings have also been declining in recent years, making us wonder if the dividend is at risk.Many investors will assess a company's dividend performance by evaluating how much the dividend payments have changed over time. Baxter International's dividend payments per share have declined at 4.3% per year on average over the past 10 years, which is uninspiring. It's never nice to see earnings and dividends falling, but at least management has cut the dividend rather than potentially risk the company's health in an attempt to maintain it.Remember, you can always get a snapshot of Baxter International's financial health, by checking our visualisation of its financial health, here.To Sum It UpFrom a dividend perspective, should investors buy or avoid Baxter International? We're a bit uncomfortable with it paying a dividend while being loss-making. However, we note that the dividend was covered by cash flow. It's not the most attractive proposition from a dividend perspective, and we'd probably give this one a miss for now.Having said that, if you're looking at this stock without much concern for the dividend, you should still be familiar of the risks involved with Baxter International. To that end, you should learn about the 2 warning signs we've spotted with Baxter International (including 1 which can't be ignored).A common investing mistake is buying the first interesting stock you see.

If you want to skip our detailed discussion about the healthcare industry, head directly to Ken Fisher’s Top 5 Healthcare Stock Picks.The healthcare sector was forever changed by the COVID-19 pandemic. While it highlighted the weaknesses in the global medical supply chains, the medical industry exhibited tremendous commitment and resilience in its pursuit to fight the global pandemic. This has since led to the need for sustainability and innovation throughout the industry. The global healthcare industry was effective in treating the pandemic with its mRNA vaccines. However, the demand for these vaccines has naturally declined since then. According to Precedence Research, the global biotech industry was valued at $1.2 trillion in 2022 and is expected to grow roughly 12% per annum over the next 7 years, reaching $3.2 trillion by 2030. While the healthcare industry foresees normalization this year to pre-pandemic levels, Deloitte expects the United States spending in the sector to increase up to $12 trillion by 2040. With the global focus on artificial intelligence, numerous biotech companies are exploring applications in workforce and patient management. Similarly, the technological advancements in medical equipment for minimally invasive procedures has a positive impact on patient recovery, through smaller incisions that are less damaging to muscle and tissue. BlackRock reported that it forecasts the minimally invasive market to be valued at $76 billion by 2027. Moreover, drug development also presents a promising future. With over 55 million Alzheimer’s patients, a new antibody treatment slowed the rate of cognitive decline by 27%. As these studies and clinical trials continue, the pharmaceutical industry is poised for more research, development, and innovation. Don't Miss: Billionaire Ken Fisher and Corporate Insiders Are Betting On These StocksWhile on the correct path, the industry still faces a number of challenges. According to Deloitte, the first major challenge has been the digital transformation in the healthcare sector. The pandemic presented an opportunity for low-cost and safe remote interactions. However, this also showcased the need for virtual health records and data management, through cloud-based solutions. In addition to electronic health records, the adoption of telemedicine can improve the organizational efficiency and cater to the labor shortages that the industry has lately experienced. Moreover, the global healthcare industry will need over 80 million additional workers by 2030. This has further stressed upon the need for ‘hospitals from home’. LBMC, a professional services CPA firm, reported that the global market for telehealth was valued in excess of $48 billion in 2022 and it is expected to grow over $57 billion in 2023. To supplement telehealth, there is a growing need for healthcare devices for remote monitoring, such as health bands. Story continuesAlso Read: Ken Fisher’s Top 15 Energy Stock PicksKen Fisher of Fisher Asset Management is one of the leading investment analysts in the world, with a net worth in excess of $6.8 billion. Last year, when the S&amp;P 500 was down by 18%, Fisher predicted the market would rise after the midterm elections. According to Fisher, since 1925, the fourth quarter for every time a midterm election has been held, the stock market has delivered positive results 83% of the time. For 2023, he expects the market to be led by “high quality mega-tech” stocks. Fisher explained that after the midterm election, investor confidence grows and the market is less risk-averse. He further explained that historically, the later half of the year, although less profitable than the first half of the year, continues to perform better than the normal market. While normally stocks rise 60%-70% of the time, in the midterm election year, stocks have reflected a 92% increase, historically. As inflation slowly declines and the US economy grows gradually, Fisher expects the market to remain positive, heading into 2024.In this article, we discuss some of Ken Fisher’s top stock picks in the healthcare sector including Merck &amp; Co., Inc. (NYSE:MRK), Intuitive Surgical, Inc. (NASDAQ:ISRG), and Eli Lilly and Company (NYSE:LLY).Our Methodology We used Fisher Asset Management’s Q2 2023 portfolio and selected the 15 biggest positions in healthcare firms during the quarter for this list. We have mentioned Fisher Asset Management’s stake value and the hedge fund sentiment towards each stock as of the second quarter of 2023. The list is ranked in the ascending order of the firm’s stake value in each holding. Ken Fisher's Top 15 Healthcare Stock PicksKen Fisher of Fisher Asset ManagementKen Fisher's Top Healthcare Stock Picks15. Medtronic plc (NYSE:MDT)Fisher Asset Management's Stake Value: $287,604,000Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 63Medtronic plc (NYSE:MDT) is a biotechnology company that focuses on the research, development, manufacture, and commercialization of medical devices. Focused on the  cardiovascular segment, the company also offers software solutions for remote monitoring. On August 17, Medtronic plc (NYSE:MDT) declared a quarterly dividend per share of $0.69. The dividend is payable on October 13 to shareholders on record as of September 22. At the end of Q2 2023, Fisher Asset Management held 3.2 million shares of Medtronic plc (NYSE:MDT) worth $287.6 million.According to Insider Monkey’s second quarter database, 63 hedge funds were bullish on Medtronic plc (NYSE:MDT), in contrast to 52 funds from the previous quarter. Jean-Marie Eveillard’s First Eagle Investment Management is the largest shareholder in the company, with 5.5 million shares worth $484.2 million. Like Merck &amp; Co., Inc. (NYSE:MRK), Intuitive Surgical, Inc. (NASDAQ:ISRG), and Eli Lilly and Company (NYSE:LLY), Medtronic plc (NYSE:MDT) is one of the top healthcare stock picks of Ken Fisher.Appleseed Fund said this about Medtronic plc (NYSE:MDT) in its Q1 2023 investor letter:“During the most recent quarter, Appleseed Fund added three new equity holdings: Medtronic plc (NYSE:MDT), Stanley Black &amp; Decker (SWK), and Synovus Financial (SNV). Medtronic is the world’s largest device manufacturer, and it holds the number one or number two market share in most of its product segments. Medtronic’s business is heavily weighted towards complicated in-patient procedures, which are typically quite profitable. Industry dynamics are quite attractive with an aging global population and the growth of improved healthcare in emerging markets; furthermore, most of its segments are highly concentrated with just 2-3 players that split each segment’s market share, affording the key participants with significant economies of scale and pricing power. The Company has been recently addressing several temporary headwinds including a strong dollar, inflation, a delayed recovery in surgical volumes from the coronavirus pandemic, and supply chain issues. Once these issues reach the rearview mirror, the Company’s growth and margin expansion plans should transform into reality.”14. GSK plc (NYSE:GSK)Fisher Asset Management's Stake Value: $492,994,000Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 35GSK plc (NYSE:GSK) is one of the leading pharmaceutical companies in the world, engaged in manufacturing medicines and vaccinations. Securities filings for Q2 2023 reveal that Fisher Asset Management held 13.8 million shares of GSK plc (NYSE:GSK) worth nearly $493 million.  On July 26, GSK plc (NYSE:GSK) announced a Q2 non-GAAP EPS of 38.80p, along with a revenue of £7.18 billion. It is one of Ken Fisher’s top healthcare picks. According to Insider Monkey’s second quarter database, 35 hedge funds were bullish on GSK plc (NYSE:GSK), as opposed to 33 hedge funds in the preceding quarter. Brandon Haley’s Holocene Advisors held a prominent stake in the company, with 2.9 million shares worth $103.9 million. Ariel Investment said this about GSK plc (NYSE:GSK) in its Q3 2022 investor letter:“By comparison, health care leader GSK plc (NYSE:GSK) was the largest detractor from performance in the quarter. Investors are concerned about legal liabilities associated with its antacid drug Zantac. While it is impossible to know the outcome with certainty, our preliminary assessment suggests that the decline in market capitalization exceeds the likely financial impact on the company.”13. Roche Holding AG (OTC:RHHBY)Fisher Asset Management's Stake Value: $549,964,000Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 2Roche Holding AG (OTC:RHHBY) is a multinational pharmaceutical company that has operations in Switzerland, Germany, and the United States.

Danaher has underperformed the S&amp;P 500 this year due to a slowdown in the bioprocessing industry and more cautious spending by biopharma customers. Bioprocessing is a key end-market that drives more than a quarter of Danaher’s profits. Bioprocessing products are the main inputs that biopharma companies use to manufacture biologic drugs, which are the fastest growing category of drugs, growing low-to-mid-teens and representing a sizable portion of the clinical pipeline.The bioprocessing industry experienced significant growth in 2021 and 2022, driven by Covid vaccines and a strong biotech funding environment. Several participants, including Danaher, lowered their 2023 growth outlook in large part due to customer inventory destocking and biotech funding weakness. We anticipate that this slowdown is temporary, and the bioprocessing industry will return to normalized growth of high-single digit to mid-teens in 2024 and beyond.…” (Click here to read the full text)7. Abbott Laboratories (NYSE:ABT)Fisher Asset Management's Stake Value: $1,054,115,000Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 62Abbott Laboratories (NYSE:ABT) is one of the leading pharmaceutical companies in the world. It is engaged in four segments – Established Pharmaceutical Products, Diagnostic Products, Nutritional Products, and Medical Devices. On July 20, Abbott Laboratories (NYSE:ABT) reported a Q2 revenue of $10 billion, along with a non-GAAP EPS of $1.08, surpassing Wall Street estimates by $280 million and $0.03, respectively. At the end of Q2 2023, Fisher Asset Management held 9.6 million shares of Abbott Laboratories (NYSE:ABT) worth $1.05 billion.According to Insider Monkey’s second quarter database, 62 hedge funds were bullish on Abbott Laboratories (NYSE:ABT), as opposed to 70 funds in the last quarter. Ric Dillon’s Diamond Hill Capital held a notable position in the company, with 5.1 million shares worth $553.4 million. Polen Global Growth Strategy said this about Abbott Laboratories (NYSE:ABT) in its Q1 2023 investor letter:“As stated below in the portfolio activity section, Abbott Laboratories (NYSE:ABT) is expected to see roughly $6 billion in COVID test sales evaporate this year, creating a headwind for margins and underlying earnings per share. As long-term owners of the business, these test sales were never part of our original investment case. The core business, our primary focus, has a clear path of growing high single digits in 2023 with durable growth beyond, in our view. We believe the current price of 23x NTM P/E , while reasonable, is also misleading considering earnings this year will be artificially depressed because of the drop in COVID testing sales. On normalized earnings, the price is lower. We anticipate underlying EPS growth of at least low-teens over the next three to five years.Lastly, we trimmed Abbott Laboratories, bringing it back to a more average position size and to also fund our increase in Thermo Fisher. Abbott is entering a year in which the company is expected to see approximately $6bn in COVID-19 test sales disappear, thus creating a headwind for margins and EPS. That said, the core business has a clear path to growing high single digits in FY23. EPS grew at a 20% CAGR from 2019-2022, far beyond our expectations when we initiated our investment. Now, we expect a more normal growth rate of low teens EPS beyond this year. Further, management’s adeptness at allocating capital continues to impress us. We expect Abbott to drive top line growth without heavily investing in R&amp;D and SG&amp;A this year — management effectively “front-loaded” those investments in 2021 and 2022 when COVID test sales created a bolus of cash. We believe this should allow for leverage on the operating margin going forward. Combined, Abbott and Thermo Fisher now represent 7% of the Portfolio.”6.

If you want to skip our detailed discussion about the healthcare industry, head directly to Ken Fisher’s Top 5 Healthcare Stock Picks.The healthcare sector was forever changed by the COVID-19 pandemic. While it highlighted the weaknesses in the global medical supply chains, the medical industry exhibited tremendous commitment and resilience in its pursuit to fight the global pandemic. This has since led to the need for sustainability and innovation throughout the industry. The global healthcare industry was effective in treating the pandemic with its mRNA vaccines. However, the demand for these vaccines has naturally declined since then. According to Precedence Research, the global biotech industry was valued at $1.2 trillion in 2022 and is expected to grow roughly 12% per annum over the next 7 years, reaching $3.2 trillion by 2030. While the healthcare industry foresees normalization this year to pre-pandemic levels, Deloitte expects the United States spending in the sector to increase up to $12 trillion by 2040. With the global focus on artificial intelligence, numerous biotech companies are exploring applications in workforce and patient management. Similarly, the technological advancements in medical equipment for minimally invasive procedures has a positive impact on patient recovery, through smaller incisions that are less damaging to muscle and tissue. BlackRock reported that it forecasts the minimally invasive market to be valued at $76 billion by 2027. Moreover, drug development also presents a promising future. With over 55 million Alzheimer’s patients, a new antibody treatment slowed the rate of cognitive decline by 27%. As these studies and clinical trials continue, the pharmaceutical industry is poised for more research, development, and innovation. Don't Miss: Billionaire Ken Fisher and Corporate Insiders Are Betting On These StocksWhile on the correct path, the industry still faces a number of challenges. According to Deloitte, the first major challenge has been the digital transformation in the healthcare sector. The pandemic presented an opportunity for low-cost and safe remote interactions. However, this also showcased the need for virtual health records and data management, through cloud-based solutions. In addition to electronic health records, the adoption of telemedicine can improve the organizational efficiency and cater to the labor shortages that the industry has lately experienced. Moreover, the global healthcare industry will need over 80 million additional workers by 2030. This has further stressed upon the need for ‘hospitals from home’. LBMC, a professional services CPA firm, reported that the global market for telehealth was valued in excess of $48 billion in 2022 and it is expected to grow over $57 billion in 2023. To supplement telehealth, there is a growing need for healthcare devices for remote monitoring, such as health bands. Story continuesAlso Read: Ken Fisher’s Top 15 Energy Stock PicksKen Fisher of Fisher Asset Management is one of the leading investment analysts in the world, with a net worth in excess of $6.8 billion. Last year, when the S&amp;P 500 was down by 18%, Fisher predicted the market would rise after the midterm elections. According to Fisher, since 1925, the fourth quarter for every time a midterm election has been held, the stock market has delivered positive results 83% of the time. For 2023, he expects the market to be led by “high quality mega-tech” stocks. Fisher explained that after the midterm election, investor confidence grows and the market is less risk-averse. He further explained that historically, the later half of the year, although less profitable than the first half of the year, continues to perform better than the normal market. While normally stocks rise 60%-70% of the time, in the midterm election year, stocks have reflected a 92% increase, historically. As inflation slowly declines and the US economy grows gradually, Fisher expects the market to remain positive, heading into 2024.In this article, we discuss some of Ken Fisher’s top stock picks in the healthcare sector including Merck &amp; Co., Inc.

Medtronic is the world’s largest device manufacturer, and it holds the number one or number two market share in most of its product segments. Medtronic’s business is heavily weighted towards complicated in-patient procedures, which are typically quite profitable. Industry dynamics are quite attractive with an aging global population and the growth of improved healthcare in emerging markets; furthermore, most of its segments are highly concentrated with just 2-3 players that split each segment’s market share, affording the key participants with significant economies of scale and pricing power. The Company has been recently addressing several temporary headwinds including a strong dollar, inflation, a delayed recovery in surgical volumes from the coronavirus pandemic, and supply chain issues.

Danaher has underperformed the S&amp;P 500 this year due to a slowdown in the bioprocessing industry and more cautious spending by biopharma customers. Bioprocessing is a key end-market that drives more than a quarter of Danaher’s profits. Bioprocessing products are the main inputs that biopharma companies use to manufacture biologic drugs, which are the fastest growing category of drugs, growing low-to-mid-teens and representing a sizable portion of the clinical pipeline.The bioprocessing industry experienced significant growth in 2021 and 2022, driven by Covid vaccines and a strong biotech funding environment. Several participants, including Danaher, lowered their 2023 growth outlook in large part due to customer inventory destocking and biotech funding weakness. We anticipate that this slowdown is temporary, and the bioprocessing industry will return to normalized growth of high-single digit to mid-teens in 2024 and beyond.…” (Click here to read the full text)7. Abbott Laboratories (NYSE:ABT)Fisher Asset Management's Stake Value: $1,054,115,000Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 62Abbott Laboratories (NYSE:ABT) is one of the leading pharmaceutical companies in the world. It is engaged in four segments – Established Pharmaceutical Products, Diagnostic Products, Nutritional Products, and Medical Devices. On July 20, Abbott Laboratories (NYSE:ABT) reported a Q2 revenue of $10 billion, along with a non-GAAP EPS of $1.08, surpassing Wall Street estimates by $280 million and $0.03, respectively. At the end of Q2 2023, Fisher Asset Management held 9.6 million shares of Abbott Laboratories (NYSE:ABT) worth $1.05 billion.According to Insider Monkey’s second quarter database, 62 hedge funds were bullish on Abbott Laboratories (NYSE:ABT), as opposed to 70 funds in the last quarter. Ric Dillon’s Diamond Hill Capital held a notable position in the company, with 5.1 million shares worth $553.4 million. Polen Global Growth Strategy said this about Abbott Laboratories (NYSE:ABT) in its Q1 2023 investor letter:“As stated below in the portfolio activity section, Abbott Laboratories (NYSE:ABT) is expected to see roughly $6 billion in COVID test sales evaporate this year, creating a headwind for margins and underlying earnings per share. As long-term owners of the business, these test sales were never part of our original investment case. The core business, our primary focus, has a clear path of growing high single digits in 2023 with durable growth beyond, in our view. We believe the current price of 23x NTM P/E , while reasonable, is also misleading considering earnings this year will be artificially depressed because of the drop in COVID testing sales. On normalized earnings, the price is lower. We anticipate underlying EPS growth of at least low-teens over the next three to five years.Lastly, we trimmed Abbott Laboratories, bringing it back to a more average position size and to also fund our increase in Thermo Fisher. Abbott is entering a year in which the company is expected to see approximately $6bn in COVID-19 test sales disappear, thus creating a headwind for margins and EPS. That said, the core business has a clear path to growing high single digits in FY23. EPS grew at a 20% CAGR from 2019-2022, far beyond our expectations when we initiated our investment. Now, we expect a more normal growth rate of low teens EPS beyond this year. Further, management’s adeptness at allocating capital continues to impress us. We expect Abbott to drive top line growth without heavily investing in R&amp;D and SG&amp;A this year — management effectively “front-loaded” those investments in 2021 and 2022 when COVID test sales created a bolus of cash. We believe this should allow for leverage on the operating margin going forward. Combined, Abbott and Thermo Fisher now represent 7% of the Portfolio.”6. Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ)Fisher Asset Management's Stake Value: $1,103,610,000Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 88Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) specializes in the manufacture of healthcare products in the consumer health segment.

Unfortunately, these high risk investments often have little probability of ever paying off, and many investors pay a price to learn their lesson. A loss-making company is yet to prove itself with profit, and eventually the inflow of external capital may dry up.If this kind of company isn't your style, you like companies that generate revenue, and even earn profits, then you may well be interested in Williams Companies (NYSE:WMB). While profit isn't the sole metric that should be considered when investing, it's worth recognising businesses that can consistently produce it. View our latest analysis for Williams Companies Williams Companies' Improving ProfitsOver the last three years, Williams Companies has grown earnings per share (EPS) at as impressive rate from a relatively low point, resulting in a three year percentage growth rate that isn't particularly indicative of expected future performance. Thus, it makes sense to focus on more recent growth rates, instead. Impressively, Williams Companies' EPS catapulted from US$1.29 to US$2.25, over the last year. It's a rarity to see 75% year-on-year growth like that.Top-line growth is a great indicator that growth is sustainable, and combined with a high earnings before interest and taxation (EBIT) margin, it's a great way for a company to maintain a competitive advantage in the market. Williams Companies' EBIT margins have actually improved by 17.0 percentage points in the last year, to reach 38%, but, on the flip side, revenue was down 5.1%. That falls short of ideal.The chart below shows how the company's bottom and top lines have progressed over time.

While crystal balls don't exist, you can check our visualization of consensus analyst forecasts for Williams Companies' future EPS 100% free.Story continuesAre Williams Companies Insiders Aligned With All Shareholders?Since Williams Companies has a market capitalisation of US$42b, we wouldn't expect insiders to hold a large percentage of shares. But we do take comfort from the fact that they are investors in the company. Notably, they have an enviable stake in the company, worth US$159m. We note that this amounts to 0.4% of the company, which may be small owing to the sheer size of Williams Companies but it's still worth mentioning. This still shows shareholders there is a degree of alignment between management and themselves.Is Williams Companies Worth Keeping An Eye On?Williams Companies' earnings per share growth have been climbing higher at an appreciable rate. That EPS growth certainly is attention grabbing, and the large insider ownership only serves to further stoke our interest. The hope is, of course, that the strong growth marks a fundamental improvement in the business economics. Based on the sum of its parts, we definitely think its worth watching Williams Companies very closely. What about risks? Every company has them, and we've spotted   2 warning signs for Williams Companies   (of which 1 is a bit unpleasant!) you should know about.There's always the possibility of doing well buying stocks that are not growing earnings and do not have insiders buying shares.

Instead, it's adopting a more forward-looking strategy towards real estate assets. Real estate experts exude a sense of careful optimism. Their strategy involves riding the existing slump while strategically preparing their companies for a future phase of consistent expansion and favorable financial outcomes. Valued at approximately $2.53 billion in 2023, the residential real estate market in the United States is projected to reach nearly $2.80 billion by 2028, as reported by Mordor Intelligence. This indicates a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of around 2.04% throughout the forecast period from 2023 to 2028. The prevailing trend of inflation in the country has deeply influenced businesses. Elevated inflation rates have prompted individuals to allocate more funds towards essential needs like sustenance and attire, concurrently impacting the real estate sector focused on home ownership. Since the COVID-19 pandemic, a multitude of buyers have capitalized on the favorable low interest rates to modify their home loans, move to new locations, or buy their first homes. As a result, there was a notable surge in home sales during the latter part of 2020, and this heightened level has persisted beyond the pre-pandemic period. Prior to the pandemic's onset, home values had been ascending, but with a remarkable surge in demand in 2020, the Freddie Mac House Price Index registered a staggering 11.3% escalation. Additionally, during the final quarter of 2021, a surplus of 142,406 housing units were accessible to address consumer needs, with more than 89% of these units being occupied by homeowners and renters. Moreover, the majority of transactions within this domain stem from citizens categorized as middle-aged and elderly. For example, individuals aged between 45 and 65 years represented over 70% of the country's homeownership rates throughout the four quarters of 2021. A substantial portion of the demand within this sector is fueled by condominiums and apartments. Apartments are projected to dominate this landscape compared to condominiums, as evidenced by the completion of 64,000 apartment units during the second quarter of 2021.Story continuesDon't Miss: 11 Most Undervalued REIT Stocks to Buy On the other hand, as per a separate report by Mordor Intelligence, the self-storage market in the United States is projected to increase from $43.34 billion in 2023 to approximately $48.73 billion by 2028, reflecting a CAGR of 2.37% within the forecast period. Owing to swift urbanization in the United States, the demand for self-storage facilities is on the rise. In 2020, as much as 82.66% of the population resided in urban regions, and projections indicate a surge to 89.16% by 2050. Consequently, the necessity for storage options is becoming increasingly urgent. Self-storage providers are capitalizing on this trend by constructing facilities in densely inhabited zones. This demand stems from multiple influences, including the prevalence of compact living spaces in heavily populated areas and individuals opting to move to smaller residences. Favorable economic momentum, including faster job establishment, elevated levels of confidence, and an increase in the number of households, is bolstering the self-storage industry. However, the expansion of the self storage market is at times hindered by government regulations. Also Read: 15 Worst Performing REITs in 2023Big moves are happening in the self storage industry.

The stock had lagged because of two issues: first, frozen food manufacturers and their customers had labor issues that restricted production and thus the need for storage; and second, the company had execution issues. It seems like industry trends are improving. Plus, the company is making progress increasing its productivity and improving margins, somewhat from the effect of hiring some new senior executives.The stability of the business and the fact that it pays a nice dividend as a REIT is a positive in this market. Even after its recent pickup, we think the stock still trades at a modest cap rate and well below its private market value, so the stock can work via growth and multiple expansion.”10.

We viewed this as an opportunity to purchase a high-quality REIT at a discounted valuation.Giving us added confidence: Storage REITs are among the best performers in the real estate sector, with net operating income margins north of 70% and the lowest recurring capital requirements. We also like the fact that NSA’s insiders share in our optimism. Late last year, National Storage’s executive chairman/founder and three directors were significant buyers of the stock.”9.

The company’s reputation as a leader in metaverse fashion led to it being acquired in late 2021 by Nike as part of a broader push by the athletic giant to experiment with blockchain.In a recent interview with Fortune, Pagotto shares how RTFKT, which generated over $185 million in NFT sales in 2022, has navigated the Nike acquisition and the ongoing bear market. He also explains how his passion for gaming has helped him develop innovative brand strategies, and discusses recent collaborations with L’Oreal and others.(This interview has been edited for brevity and clarity.)Can you tell us about your background and how you got into Web3 and NFTs?I studied fine arts, and then I worked a lot in advertising and consulting for luxury clients in retail design. When I was a student, I had a job at Colette, the really cool concept store in Paris, which is one of the places where I learned the most, and that influenced a lot of how we run RTFKT today. They were taking different parts of culture and putting it together under the same roof, but really, merging high fashion with streetwear and art, design, all of that together. So I learned a lot when I was a student and working there day to day, and then I got into NFTs.I'm a huge, huge gamer. Even though NFTs are great, I always consider them just as a medium to allow you to do things that you can normally only do in video games, which is to get people to own and trade and use digital assets. So when I discovered NFTs in 2018, at the time I was working in Esports with a company that was making something like NFTs out of Counter-Strike skins. To me, it was kind of a eureka moment.So that's the moment we started RTFKT, when the NFT market started to blow up. It was a perfect canvas to do our idea, which was a brand that is sitting between reality and the virtual world, and that is constantly playing around these spaces to make cool, exciting, new stuff and innovations.Story continuesHow many hours per day do you play games?It depends. Like in the past few weeks, I played a lot because the new Zelda came out and I think I did 130 hours, which is a lot.It's like a separate job.Almost, but a lot of ideas I have or things I come up with, it's because I've experienced them in video games. I’m always trying to think: “How can you take what this game has done, and how it can inspire you to do something cool for a brand?”The new Zelda added even more what is called ""player agency."" If you look on TikTok you see what people are doing with these new gameplay mechanics, and it's mind-blowing. So, really, that's what I advise all my friends these days. I'm telling them: “Stop doing what you do—you need to play Zelda.” You will learn more playing Zelda, especially if you play it with your little brother, your little sister, and you see how they are embracing this freedom and these tools that are given in the game. You will learn more doing this than coming to the conferences.So what is the most powerful marketing tool for you for now?To me, honestly, the most powerful marketing tool is just making stuff that is dope. It's simple: It's the content. You need your content to be fresh and exciting, because we're all on our phones every day and seeing so many things from brands, from amateurs, from influencers, and it's very hard to know what is really genuine and not. I think people react when they see something that is genuinely cool and exciting and new.What about the recent performance of NFTs?We’re in a super bear market. It was meant to happen because there was such a huge spike. I think it's good in a sense that the technology and the money side are going to take a bit of a backseat. People are going to leverage NFTs more as a medium, and not just as NFTs for NFTs sake.It’s very hard for a lot of small Web3 companies that started during the hype or raised money during the hype to now have to sustain themselves, especially because the royalties are not there anymore, so the business model has changed.RTFKT was acquired at the end of 2021 by Nike. How have things changed for you since then?It didn't change too much. Now we work a lot more closely with Nike to help them on their own Web3 initiatives, with DotSwoosh, but what's great is that we stay mainly independent. Nike really understands that our strength is the brand and that we're not Nike, and that's why we can do things Nike cannot do. Sometimes RTFKT and Nike do collaborations, so it's been really good for both parties, and they have a really amazing brand.But, again, I always go back to the people behind the brand: They are amazing super smart, very innovative people, who are working on really groundbreaking things and have big ideas. I'm super happy to get to know them and work with them.Are you planning any additional partnerships?We never announce in advance, but there are always things going on. We did Rimowa—very happy to have that, they've been amazing partners to work with. We announced that we are working with [L’Oreal owned] Shu Uemura, which is really really good makeup brand that we like, with Japanese influence.So do you see the Asian market as more active when it comes to buying NFTs?Right now, yes. In Asia, it's been a long time that video games and Esports have been a big thing, and they have a collectibles culture, especially in Japan. But of course, we also have a lot of American degens—crypto people.This story was originally featured on Fortune.comMore from Fortune: 5 side hustles where you may earn over $20,000 per year—all while working from homeLooking to make extra cash?

The ex-dividend date occurs one day before the record date which is the day on which shareholders need to be on the company's books in order to receive a dividend. The ex-dividend date is of consequence because whenever a stock is bought or sold, the trade takes at least two business day to settle. Accordingly, CSX investors that purchase the stock on or after the 30th of August will not receive the dividend, which will be paid on the 15th of September.The company's next dividend payment will be US$0.11 per share, on the back of last year when the company paid a total of US$0.44 to shareholders. Looking at the last 12 months of distributions, CSX has a trailing yield of approximately 1.4% on its current stock price of $30.91. Dividends are a major contributor to investment returns for long term holders, but only if the dividend continues to be paid. As a result, readers should always check whether CSX has been able to grow its dividends, or if the dividend might be cut. Check out our latest analysis for CSX If a company pays out more in dividends than it earned, then the dividend might become unsustainable - hardly an ideal situation. CSX is paying out just 21% of its profit after tax, which is comfortably low and leaves plenty of breathing room in the case of adverse events. Yet cash flow is typically more important than profit for assessing dividend sustainability, so we should always check if the company generated enough cash to afford its dividend. Fortunately, it paid out only 27% of its free cash flow in the past year.It's positive to see that CSX's dividend is covered by both profits and cash flow, since this is generally a sign that the dividend is sustainable, and a lower payout ratio usually suggests a greater margin of safety before the dividend gets cut.Story continuesClick here to see the company's payout ratio, plus analyst estimates of its future dividends.historic-dividendHave Earnings And Dividends Been Growing?Companies that aren't growing their earnings can still be valuable, but it is even more important to assess the sustainability of the dividend if it looks like the company will struggle to grow. If business enters a downturn and the dividend is cut, the company could see its value fall precipitously. That explains why we're not overly excited about CSX's flat earnings over the past five years. It's better than seeing them drop, certainly, but over the long term, all of the best dividend stocks are able to meaningfully grow their earnings per share. Earnings per share growth in recent times has not been a standout. Yet there are several ways to grow the dividend, and one of them is simply that the company may choose to pay out more of its earnings as dividends.Many investors will assess a company's dividend performance by evaluating how much the dividend payments have changed over time. Since the start of our data, 10 years ago, CSX has lifted its dividend by approximately 9.0% a year on average.To Sum It UpIs CSX an attractive dividend stock, or better left on the shelf? The company has barely grown earnings per share over this time, but at least it's paying out a decently low percentage of its earnings and cashflow as dividends. This could suggest management is reinvesting in future growth opportunities. Generally we like to see both low payout ratios and strong earnings per share growth, but CSX is halfway there. It's a promising combination that should mark this company worthy of closer attention.In light of that, while CSX has an appealing dividend, it's worth knowing the risks involved with this stock. For example - CSX has 1 warning sign we think you should be aware of.If you're in the market for strong dividend payers, we recommend checking our selection of top dividend stocks.Have feedback on this article?

(NASDAQ:ROST) is about to go ex-dividend in just four days. The ex-dividend date is usually set to be one business day before the record date which is the cut-off date on which you must be present on the company's books as a shareholder in order to receive the dividend. The ex-dividend date is an important date to be aware of as any purchase of the stock made on or after this date might mean a late settlement that doesn't show on the record date. In other words, investors can purchase Ross Stores' shares before the 1st of September in order to be eligible for the dividend, which will be paid on the 29th of September.The company's next dividend payment will be US$0.34 per share, on the back of last year when the company paid a total of US$1.34 to shareholders. Calculating the last year's worth of payments shows that Ross Stores has a trailing yield of 1.1% on the current share price of $119. Dividends are an important source of income to many shareholders, but the health of the business is crucial to maintaining those dividends. So we need to check whether the dividend payments are covered, and if earnings are growing. Check out our latest analysis for Ross Stores Dividends are typically paid from company earnings. If a company pays more in dividends than it earned in profit, then the dividend could be unsustainable. Ross Stores paid out a comfortable 27% of its profit last year. A useful secondary check can be to evaluate whether Ross Stores generated enough free cash flow to afford its dividend. Luckily it paid out just 21% of its free cash flow last year.It's positive to see that Ross Stores's dividend is covered by both profits and cash flow, since this is generally a sign that the dividend is sustainable, and a lower payout ratio usually suggests a greater margin of safety before the dividend gets cut.Story continuesClick here to see the company's payout ratio, plus analyst estimates of its future dividends.historic-dividendHave Earnings And Dividends Been Growing?Stocks in companies that generate sustainable earnings growth often make the best dividend prospects, as it is easier to lift the dividend when earnings are rising. If earnings decline and the company is forced to cut its dividend, investors could watch the value of their investment go up in smoke. This is why it's a relief to see Ross Stores earnings per share are up 5.7% per annum over the last five years. Management have been reinvested more than half of the company's earnings within the business, and the company has been able to grow earnings with this retained capital. We think this is generally an attractive combination, as dividends can grow through a combination of earnings growth and or a higher payout ratio over time.Another key way to measure a company's dividend prospects is by measuring its historical rate of dividend growth. Ross Stores has delivered 17% dividend growth per year on average over the past 10 years. We're glad to see dividends rising alongside earnings over a number of years, which may be a sign the company intends to share the growth with shareholders.Final TakeawayHas Ross Stores got what it takes to maintain its dividend payments? Earnings per share have been growing moderately, and Ross Stores is paying out less than half its earnings and cash flow as dividends, which is an attractive combination as it suggests the company is investing in growth. We would prefer to see earnings growing faster, but the best dividend stocks over the long term typically combine significant earnings per share growth with a low payout ratio, and Ross Stores is halfway there. Ross Stores looks solid on this analysis overall, and we'd definitely consider investigating it more closely.In light of that, while Ross Stores has an appealing dividend, it's worth knowing the risks involved with this stock. For example, we've found 1 warning sign for Ross Stores that we recommend you consider before investing in the business.A common investing mistake is buying the first interesting stock you see.

The ex-dividend date is important as the process of settlement involves two full business days. So if you miss that date, you would not show up on the company's books on the record date. Therefore, if you purchase Analog Devices' shares on or after the 1st of September, you won't be eligible to receive the dividend, when it is paid on the 14th of September.The company's next dividend payment will be US$0.86 per share.

As a result, readers should always check whether Analog Devices has been able to grow its dividends, or if the dividend might be cut.

That's why it's good to see Analog Devices paying out a modest 45% of its earnings. That said, even highly profitable companies sometimes might not generate enough cash to pay the dividend, which is why we should always check if the dividend is covered by cash flow. Thankfully its dividend payments took up just 44% of the free cash flow it generated, which is a comfortable payout ratio.It's positive to see that Analog Devices's dividend is covered by both profits and cash flow, since this is generally a sign that the dividend is sustainable, and a lower payout ratio usually suggests a greater margin of safety before the dividend gets cut.Story continuesClick here to see the company's payout ratio, plus analyst estimates of its future dividends.historic-dividendHave Earnings And Dividends Been Growing?Businesses with strong growth prospects usually make the best dividend payers, because it's easier to grow dividends when earnings per share are improving.

It's encouraging to see Analog Devices has grown its earnings rapidly, up 27% a year for the past five years. Earnings per share have been growing very quickly, and the company is paying out a relatively low percentage of its profit and cash flow. Companies with growing earnings and low payout ratios are often the best long-term dividend stocks, as the company can both grow its earnings and increase the percentage of earnings that it pays out, essentially multiplying the dividend.The main way most investors will assess a company's dividend prospects is by checking the historical rate of dividend growth. Analog Devices has delivered 11% dividend growth per year on average over the past 10 years. Both per-share earnings and dividends have both been growing rapidly in recent times, which is great to see.Final TakeawayIs Analog Devices worth buying for its dividend? We love that Analog Devices is growing earnings per share while simultaneously paying out a low percentage of both its earnings and cash flow. These characteristics suggest the company is reinvesting in growing its business, while the conservative payout ratio also implies a reduced risk of the dividend being cut in the future. Analog Devices looks solid on this analysis overall, and we'd definitely consider investigating it more closely.On that note, you'll want to research what risks Analog Devices is facing. For example - Analog Devices has 1 warning sign we think you should be aware of.If you're in the market for strong dividend payers, we recommend checking our selection of top dividend stocks.Have feedback on this article?

These derivatives derive their value, risk assessment, and fundamental term structure from an underlying asset, like a stock.Warning! GuruFocus has detected 4 Warning Sign with VZ. Click here to check it out. VZ 30-Year Financial DataThe intrinsic value of VZOptions function akin to insurance policies, where one party takes on risk in exchange for a premium while the counter party off-loads risk while paying a premium. While predominantly engaged with by large institutional investors, an increasing number of individual investors are embracing options within their brokerage accounts. This shift arises as trading platforms evolve in sophistication, and a broader segment of the populace seeks to safeguard their funds against fluctuations in the equity market or to speculate of market movements.Buying and Selling OptionsBuying an Options grant investors the privilege, though not the obligation, to buy or sell said underlying asset. Selling (also known as writing) an option on the other hand obligates the seller to buy or sell the underlying asset. While the idea of options scare some investors, they do not have to be scary or risky. There are many conservative strategies in the world of options which can be utilized to generate income without taking a whole lot of risk.In this article, I will describe two simple option strategies which can be easily used by investors to generate extra income with little additional risk. Both these strategies involve ""selling"" (or writing) options. The options are written at a strike price close to where the stock is currently traded. So these options currently are ""at or near the money"".Story continuesOut of the Money Covered CallA covered call is a popular options trading strategy that involves an investor owning an underlying asset, typically stocks, and simultaneously selling a call option on that asset. This strategy is often used by investors who hold a particular stock and are looking to generate additional income from their holdings while potentially limiting some of the downside risk.How a Covered Call WorksHere's how a covered call works:Ownership of Underlying Asset: The investor already owns a certain amount of a particular stock. This ownership of the stock is what ""covers"" the call option position.Selling a Call Option: The investor then sells (writes) a call option on the same stock they own. A call option gives the buyer the right, but not the obligation, to purchase the underlying stock at a predetermined price (strike price) before a specified expiration date.Generating Income: In return for selling the call option, the investor receives a premium (payment) from the buyer of the call option. This premium represents the income generated from the strategy.Outcomes at Expiration:If the stock price remains below the strike price of the call option by the expiration date, the call option will expire worthless. The investor keeps the premium received from selling the call, and they can repeat the strategy by selling another call option if desired.If the stock price rises significantly and is above the strike price at expiration, the buyer of the call option may choose to exercise the option. In this case, the investor's stock will be sold at the strike price, and they still keep the premium received. However, they would miss out on potential gains above the strike price.The goal of a covered call strategy is to generate income from the premium received while potentially benefiting from small to moderate stock price movements or even slight price decreases. It provides a way to enhance returns and manage risk for investors who are already holding the underlying stock.It's important to note that while covered calls can provide income and risk reduction, they also have limitations. If the stock price experiences a significant increase, the investor's potential gains are capped at the strike price of the call option. Additionally, if the stock price declines significantly, the premium received from selling the call may not fully offset the losses from the stock's decline.Example of a Covered CallImagine you own 1000 shares of Verizon Communications Inc (NYSE:VZ). According to Gurufocus the company is selling at a depressed price. The company pays a nice dividend of 7.83% and you are underwater on the stock and you don't want to sell it. But you would not mind generating some extra income from your Verizon Communications Inc (NYSE:VZ) stock. So you sell (write) some call options on Verizon Communications Inc (NYSE:VZ) at with a strike price of $34 and an expiry of April 19, 2024. You get a premium of $1.90 for underwriting the risk. Now if the Verizon Communications Inc (NYSE:VZ) stock is over $34 on April 30, 2024 the stock will be called and you will be forced to sell the stock at $34, but you still get to keep the commission. If the stock remains flat or drop below the strike price you get to keep the premium. Assuming the stock remains flat you not only get the annualized dividend of 7.83% but get the annualized call premium of 8.77%.Of course the risk is that if the stock rises much above the stock price, you will have lost the opportunity for the gain. You pay for this strategy by losing out on this opportunity, i.e., there is no free lunch. In this case a forced sell could be painful if the Verizon Communications Inc (NYSE:VZ) stock shoots up. In that case if you still wanted to hold the stock you'd have to pay the market price.Cash Covered PutsA cash-covered put is an options trading strategy that involves selling (writing) a put option while simultaneously setting aside enough cash to cover the potential purchase of the underlying asset if the option is exercised. This strategy is considered a more conservative approach compared to naked puts, as the investor has the funds readily available to fulfill their obligation if the put option is exercised.How a Cash-Covered Put WorksHere's how a cash-covered put works:Selling a Put Option: The investor sells a put option on a specific stock or underlying asset. A put option gives the buyer the right, but not the obligation, to sell the underlying asset to the investor at a predetermined price (strike price) before a specified expiration date.Setting Aside Cash: Before selling the put option, the investor ensures that they have enough cash in their trading account to cover the potential purchase of the underlying asset at the strike price. This is where the term ""cash-covered"" comes from. The amount of cash set aside is equal to the strike price multiplied by the number of shares the put option represents.Receiving a Premium: When the investor sells the put option, they receive a premium (payment) from the buyer of the put option. This premium represents the income generated from the strategy.Outcomes at Expiration:If the stock price remains above the strike price of the put option by the expiration date, the put option will expire worthless. The investor keeps the premium received from selling the put option, and the set-aside cash remains untouched.If the stock price falls below the strike price and the put option is in-the-money (profitable for the option buyer), the buyer may choose to exercise the option. In this case, the investor is obligated to buy the underlying stock at the strike price, and they use the set-aside cash to purchase the stock.The primary advantage of a cash-covered put is that the investor has the means to fulfill their obligation if the put option is exercised. This reduces the risk compared to naked puts, where the investor might not have the necessary funds to buy the stock at the strike price.This strategy is often used by investors who are willing and able to buy the underlying stock at a specific (strike) price and are looking to generate income from the premium received by selling the put option. It's a strategy that combines potential income with a conservative risk management approach. However, it's still important to consider market risks and fluctuations when using any options trading strategy.Example of a Cash-Covered PutAgain using Verizon Communications Inc (NYSE:VZ) as an example. You sell (write) some put options on Verizon Communications Inc (NYSE:VZ) at with a strike price of $34 and an expiry of April 19, 2024. You get a premium of $3 for underwriting the risk. If on or after the expiration date the stock is over $34 - you get to keep the premium. If the stock trades below $34 - the stock can be put (i.e. Sold) to you at anytime before or at expiration. Given the risk of being ""put"", it is imperative that you have cash handy to be able to absorb the forced buy (hence cash covered put). But the cash does not need to sit idle - it can be in a money market fund earning interest - which is another 4.5% annualized at current rates. (JPST an ultra short bond ETF currently yields 5.3%). In addition you are also earning some return on the premium collected as you get the premium paid in advance.Therefore selling put options can net you up to ~19% annualized income as compared to ~8% if you relied on income alone. The risk of being put the stock (i.e. A forced buy) is acceptable in this case as Verizon Communications Inc (NYSE:VZ) is in my view undervalued. This strategy will not be suitable if the underlying stock is in overvalued territory. You should be prepared to buy the stock if the stock is put to you.ConclusionThe option strategies described above illustrate that Options don't have to be scary and that conservative investors can use option strategies to generate income from stocks without taking a lot of risk. The covered call strategy is used to juice the income from a stock you already have which you don't mind letting go off if it is called. It works great for stocks which you are considering selling anyway and feel that they are close to fully valued or over-valued. The cash covered put strategy on the other hand is ideal for stocks which are under-valued and you don't mind buying them at the strike price if the stock is put to you.This article first appeared on GuruFocus.]"
59,e8bcabd5-c108-37f4-b4ff-9a1891d7647b,VZ,2023-08-27,Verizon Communications (NYSE:VZ) Will Want To Turn Around Its Return Trends,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/verizon-communications-nyse-vz-want-130015295.html,1693054815,STORY,['VZ'],"[Did you know there are some financial metrics that can provide clues of a potential multi-bagger? One common approach is to try and find a company with returns on capital employed (ROCE) that are increasing, in conjunction with a growing amount of capital employed. Basically this means that a company has profitable initiatives that it can continue to reinvest in, which is a trait of a compounding machine. Although, when we looked at Verizon Communications (NYSE:VZ), it didn't seem to tick all of these boxes.Return On Capital Employed (ROCE): What Is It?If you haven't worked with ROCE before, it measures the 'return' (pre-tax profit) a company generates from capital employed in its business. To calculate this metric for Verizon Communications, this is the formula:Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)0.093 = US$31b ÷ (US$380b - US$51b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to June 2023).So, Verizon Communications has an ROCE of 9.3%.  On its own that's a low return, but compared to the average of 5.9% generated by the Telecom industry, it's much better. View our latest analysis for Verizon Communications roceAbove you can see how the current ROCE for Verizon Communications compares to its prior returns on capital, but there's only so much you can tell from the past. If you'd like, you can check out the forecasts from the analysts covering Verizon Communications here  for free.So How Is Verizon Communications' ROCE Trending?When we looked at the ROCE trend at Verizon Communications, we didn't gain much confidence. Around five years ago the returns on capital were 13%, but since then they've fallen to 9.3%. On the other hand, the company has been employing more capital without a corresponding improvement in sales in the last year, which could suggest these investments are longer term plays. It's worth keeping an eye on the company's earnings from here on to see if these investments do end up contributing to the bottom line.Story continuesThe Bottom LineBringing it all together, while we're somewhat encouraged by Verizon Communications' reinvestment in its own business, we're aware that returns are shrinking. Since the stock has declined 22% over the last five years, investors may not be too optimistic on this trend improving either. In any case, the stock doesn't have these traits of a multi-bagger discussed above, so if that's what you're looking for, we think you'd have more luck elsewhere.On a separate note, we've found   1 warning sign for Verizon Communications   you'll probably want to know about.For those who like to invest in solid companies, check out this free list of companies with solid balance sheets and high returns on equity.Have feedback on this article?

If you want to skip our discussion on the current technology landscape, head directly to 5 Best Performing Technology ETFs in 2023. In 2023, technology stocks are experiencing a strong surge in value following a significant decline in 2022. However, despite the substantial gains driven partially by the recent hype around artificial intelligence, investors in ETFs are not uniformly rushing to invest in the sector. The movement of money within the technology sector this year has left Todd Sohn, an ETF strategist at Strategas, perplexed. In June 2023, he pointed out the outflow of funds from two major ETFs – the Technology Select Sector SPDR Fund (NYSE:XLK), which mirrors a tech stock index in the S&amp;P 500, and the Invesco QQQ Trust (NASDAQ:QQQ), providing investors exposure to the tech-focused Nasdaq-100 index. Despite both ETFs surging by more than 30% this year following a dismal performance in 2022, Sohn identified the outflows from the Invesco QQQ Trust (NASDAQ:QQQ) in this year as unusual. He noted that even though investors are gravitating toward the smaller, more economical version of the fund, the Invesco NASDAQ 100 ETF (NASDAQ:QQQM), for tech exposure, the substantial gains of the former haven't been accompanied by a clear trend of herd behavior. Regarding the Technology Select Sector SPDR Fund (NYSE:XLK), ETF investors seem to still harbor ""some skepticism"" about the recovery of the U.S. equity market from the harsh downturn of the previous year, Sohn commented. Dave Nadig, a financial futurist at VettaFi, believes that another profitable stretch awaits in the technology and artificial intelligence space. However, he indicated that there are constraints to the potential upside. Nadig forecasted that the sectors set to experience the most significant growth are industrial, robotics, and automation. He commented: “AI is going to have a long-term and significant positive effect on GDP ... [But] it’s very difficult to pick public companies that are going to be the outsized beneficiaries of that. We run into this all the time when we have cool new technology … and we end up buying Google and Microsoft and Apple and Nvidia, which we all already probably own too much of.”Story continuesNVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) CEO Jensen Huang expects that the surge in artificial intelligence will extend well into 2024. To substantiate his optimism, he made what could possibly be the largest individual investment in the technology sector. NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)’s Q2 financial results exceeded Wall Street's predictions, and the company disclosed intentions to repurchase an additional $25 billion worth of its own common shares – a strategy commonly employed when a company's leadership believes its value is underrated. Although NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)’s stock price has surged by over threefold this year and was poised to achieve a record peak following Q2 results, the company intends to boost the production of its hardware well into the following year. This has effectively dispelled concerns raised by a few analysts regarding the sustainability of the AI frenzy. Additionally, NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) enjoys a near-monopoly over the computing systems that drive services like ChatGPT. In this article, we discuss some of the best performing technology ETFs in 2023, which offer investors exposure to Broadcom Inc.

Invesco QQQ Trust (NASDAQ:QQQ)YTD Share Price Performance as of August 24: 39.82%From its inception in 1999, Invesco QQQ Trust (NASDAQ:QQQ) has consistently shown a track record of strong performance, often surpassing the S&amp;P 500 Index. Invesco QQQ Trust (NASDAQ:QQQ) tracks the Nasdaq-100 Index and includes prominent technology stocks. The fund features an expense ratio of 0.2% and holds 101 stocks in its portfolio. As of August 23, 2023, Invesco QQQ Trust (NASDAQ:QQQ) has $200.91 billion in assets under management. It is one of the best  performing ETFs in the technology sector. Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) is the largest holding of Invesco QQQ Trust (NASDAQ:QQQ). On August 3, Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) announced financial results for its fiscal 2023 third quarter ended July 1, 2023. The company reported earnings per share of $1.26, beating market estimates by $0.07. The revenue came in line with Wall Street consensus at $81.8 billion. According to Insider Monkey’s second quarter database, 135 hedge funds were bullish on Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), compared to 131 funds in the preceding quarter. Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway is the leading position holder in the company, with 915.5 million shares worth $177.6 billion. Like Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO), Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), and DraftKings Inc. (NASDAQ:DKNG), Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) is one of the best technology stocks to buy. Choice Equities Capital Management made the following comment about Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) in its second quarter 2023 investor letter:“Dramatic valuation differences across market cap sizes continue. This has been the case for some time now. Perhaps I have spent too much time discussing these dichotomies, as generally, I feel like if we pick the right stocks and manage market exposures thoughtfully, our equities- oriented portfolio will prosper across various market cycles. However, when markets become as lopsided as they have lately, I feel additional discussion on the market environment is worthwhile, if only to help highlight the opportunities that are available and the likely path forward. I expect future discussions to soon be focused again on our moderately concentrated portfolio. But for now, let’s take one last in-depth look at how far reaching these valuation dichotomies have again become.(Please note: charts that accompany the following can be found in the Appendix.)Take Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) for example. It is the largest stock by market cap, and fairly considered one of the best companies in the world. The company has been extraordinarily successful and improved standards of living everywhere in the process with their ubiquitous products. Along the way, shareholders have been richly rewarded, with shares increasing nearly fourteen-fold over the last ten years while generating an annualized total shareholder return of 31%, including dividends.On the back of another big quarter for large cap tech, it is now the first stock to surpass the $3T market cap threshold. This makes its weighting in the ~$37T market cap of the S&amp;P 500, ~8%. It also means this one stock’s market cap is larger than that of the entire ~$2.98T market cap of the Russell 2000 index, the first time in history a single stock has outweighed the Russell 2000 – aside from two brief days in September 2020 when Apple’s market cap then accomplished the same…” (Click here to read the full text)9.

Chip densities are now approaching the limits of physics and Moore’s law is stretched to its atomic limitations. Future innovation is around 3D stacks of chips and advanced packaging. LAM has heavily invested in tools that push innovation at the atomic level. Despite this investment, it requires little shareholder capital to grow and therefore it returns capital through healthy dividends and share repurchases. LAM has been a wonderful performer for us over the last two years.”8. iShares Expanded Tech Sector ETF (NYSE:IGM)YTD Share Price Performance as of August 24: 41.39%iShares Expanded Tech Sector ETF (NYSE:IGM) aims to replicate the investment outcomes of the S&amp;P North American Expanded Technology Sector Index, which includes technology sector firms in North America, along with companies from communication services and consumer discretionary sectors. iShares Expanded Tech Sector ETF (NYSE:IGM) was established on March 13, 2001.

This unprecedented acceleration is driven by growing demand for GenAI. We are at the tipping point of a new era of computing with NVIDIA at its epicenter. While the opportunity within the datacenter installed base is already large at approximately $1 trillion, the pace of innovation in AI in general, and GenAI in particular, should drive a significant expansion in the addressable market, as AI creates a new way for human-computer interaction through language, and as companies are better able to utilize their data for decision-making. We remain shareholders as we believe NVIDIA’s end-to-end AI platform and the ecosystem it has cultivated over the last 15 years will benefit the company for years to come.”7.

Most notably, crypto market cap has declined from a peak of ~$3 Trillion last fall, to ~$1.1 Trillion today (a -63% decline, and -72% peak-to-trough; LINK). Crypto is a volatile asset class, and has experienced many draw-downs of similar magnitude in the past. For example, Bitcoin was down -93% during 2011, -85% from 2013-15, and -84% from 2017-18. In this context, the latest draw-down is a pretty normal outcome for this emerging asset class.A large reason for this volatility is simply because there aren’t any major “real-world use cases” for the asset just yet. In our letter outlining the investment last year, we wrote that crypto is still “in the middle of ‘crossing the chasm’ into mainstream adoption &amp; use cases, which will result in millions of mainstream users needing to transact crypto in some form”…” (Click here to see the full text)6.

(NASDAQ:META) (5.2%) for a 13.3% exposure, or about half the Index’s weight in the giants. And while Alphabet’s 36% return for the first half and Meta’s 138% return were gratefully received, I’m pleased to report that if we strip out that contribution to our overall return, the other 23 stocks we own, constituting 85% of our portfolio (with cash making up the balance), were up 10.2% on a weighted basis.GCAM owns two of the seven tech mega caps in Alphabet and Meta, and they enjoyed similar rises. As mentioned, Alphabet A&amp;C shares rose 36% while Meta rose 138%. Together, they added 2.38 percentage points to the overall Index return, meaning these seven tech giants cumulatively generated 12.4 percentage points of return, or roughly three-quarters of the Index’s return.Alphabet and Meta combined sport a $2.25 trillion market cap and between them should generate roughly $120 billion of pretax profit this year. That’s a multiple of 19 times pretax profit, a substantial discount to Microsoft and Apple, and an even larger discount to Amazon, Nvidia and Tesla.” Click to continue reading and see 5 Best Performing Technology ETFs in 2023.  Suggested articles:Long-Term Returns of Keith Meister's Activist Targets11 Most Undervalued Dow Stocks To Buy According To Hedge Funds11 Most Undervalued REIT Stocks to Buy Disclosure: None. 10 Best Performing Technology ETFs in 2023 is originally published on Insider Monkey.]"

(NASDAQ:CHRW) is about to trade ex-dividend in the next 4 days. The ex-dividend date occurs one day before the record date which is the day on which shareholders need to be on the company's books in order to receive a dividend. It is important to be aware of the ex-dividend date because any trade on the stock needs to have been settled on or before the record date. This means that investors who purchase C.H. Robinson Worldwide's shares on or after the 31st of August will not receive the dividend, which will be paid on the 2nd of October.The company's next dividend payment will be US$0.61 per share, on the back of last year when the company paid a total of US$2.44 to shareholders. Based on the last year's worth of payments, C.H. Robinson Worldwide stock has a trailing yield of around 2.6% on the current share price of $93.76. We love seeing companies pay a dividend, but it's also important to be sure that laying the golden eggs isn't going to kill our golden goose! That's why we should always check whether the dividend payments appear sustainable, and if the company is growing. See our latest analysis for C.H. Robinson Worldwide Dividends are usually paid out of company profits, so if a company pays out more than it earned then its dividend is usually at greater risk of being cut. C.H. Robinson Worldwide is paying out an acceptable 54% of its profit, a common payout level among most companies. Yet cash flows are even more important than profits for assessing a dividend, so we need to see if the company generated enough cash to pay its distribution. The good news is it paid out just 16% of its free cash flow in the last year.It's positive to see that C.H. Robinson Worldwide's dividend is covered by both profits and cash flow, since this is generally a sign that the dividend is sustainable, and a lower payout ratio usually suggests a greater margin of safety before the dividend gets cut.Story continuesClick here to see the company's payout ratio, plus analyst estimates of its future dividends.historic-dividendHave Earnings And Dividends Been Growing?Companies with consistently growing earnings per share generally make the best dividend stocks, as they usually find it easier to grow dividends per share. If earnings decline and the company is forced to cut its dividend, investors could watch the value of their investment go up in smoke. This is why it's a relief to see C.H. Robinson Worldwide earnings per share are up 5.0% per annum over the last five years. While earnings have been growing at a credible rate, the company is paying out a majority of its earnings to shareholders. If management lifts the payout ratio further, we'd take this as a tacit signal that the company's growth prospects are slowing.The main way most investors will assess a company's dividend prospects is by checking the historical rate of dividend growth. In the past 10 years, C.H. Robinson Worldwide has increased its dividend at approximately 5.7% a year on average. It's encouraging to see the company lifting dividends while earnings are growing, suggesting at least some corporate interest in rewarding shareholders.To Sum It UpHas C.H. Robinson Worldwide got what it takes to maintain its dividend payments? While earnings per share growth has been modest, C.H. Robinson Worldwide's dividend payouts are around an average level; without a sharp change in earnings we feel that the dividend is likely somewhat sustainable. Pleasingly the company paid out a conservatively low percentage of its free cash flow. To summarise, C.H. Robinson Worldwide looks okay on this analysis, although it doesn't appear a stand-out opportunity.So while C.H. Robinson Worldwide looks good from a dividend perspective, it's always worthwhile being up to date with the risks involved in this stock. Our analysis shows 2 warning signs for C.H. Robinson Worldwide and you should be aware of these before buying any shares.If you're in the market for strong dividend payers, we recommend checking our selection of top dividend stocks.Have feedback on this article?

If you want to skip our detailed analysis of recent news and the market position of Disney, then head straight to 5 Worst Performing Disney Animated Movies of All Time. Disney, one of the biggest entertainment companies globally, has been in the news recently due to its financial situation and problems in different areas. In the last 15 months, The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS) has encountered substantial setbacks at the box office, culminating in an astonishing financial deficit of nearly $2 billion. For the past year and a half, The Walt Disney Company has faced challenges with its movies making money. Movies like Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny (2023), Strange World (2022), and Lightyear (2022) didn't perform well, causing the company to underperform with each of these films. This unlucky pattern for Walt Disney Studios is continuing with Haunted Mansion (2023), which might actually make the studio lose an additional $225 million.According to box office analyst Valliant Renegade, the primary reasons behind Disney's ongoing struggles in attracting theater audiences are closely linked to their own streaming service. However, there's a differing perspective from Movieguide that points to a more fundamental issue lying in the moral messages conveyed by their recent releases.As reported by Movieguide: “Disney and Pixar movies used to be a sure thing at the box office, but it looks like the movie studio is still struggling to connect with audiences. The studio’s last two offerings, LIGHTYEAR and STRANGE WORLD, both suffered at the box office for multiple reasons, but the biggest one is content. Both LIGHTYEAR and STRANGE WORLD failed to find their footing with audiences and failed at the box office — LIGHTYEAR made $226 million off a $200 million budget, while STRANGE WORLD majorly flopped, making just $70 million off a $180 million budget. Each of these movies featured content that was not family-friendly, which meant many parents chose not to take their children to the theater.”Story continuesContinuing the evaluation of The Walt Disney Company's recent challenges, insights from Aristotle Atlantic Partners shed light on the company's performance, as detailed in its Q2 2023 investor letter. The investor letter underscores the noteworthy shifts that have transpired for Disney since the introduction of Disney+ almost three years ago.The statistical overview provided by Aristotle Atlantic Partners reveals a -0.86% return for The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS) since the commencement of the year, with a more substantial drop of -18.82% observed in the 12-month returns. As of July 28, 2023, the company's stock had closed at $86.13 per share.Here’s how Aristotle Atlantic Partners shared its perspective on The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS) in its investor letter for Q2 2023: “We sold our position in Disney, as the shift to streaming since the launch of Disney Plus nearly three years ago has been more challenging than expected. Overall company margins have declined, primarily driven by losses in the streaming segment, as Disney Plus strives to attract more subscribers. The focus on growth and profitability in streaming has come at the expense of reduced licensing revenues, as content shifts from the company’s traditional linear networks to Disney Plus. Additionally, Disney is going through this challenging transition amidst upheaval in senior management.”In an effort to counteract these losses, Disney has taken steps to trim its workforce. During a recent earnings call transcript, Robert Iger, the CEO of Disney, discussed a comprehensive $5.5 billion savings plan. He remarked, “In the eight months since I returned, we’ve undertaken an unprecedented transformation at Disney and this quarter’s earnings reflect some of what we have accomplished. First, the company was completely restructured, restoring creativity to the center of our business. We made important management changes and efficiency improvements to create a more cost-effective, coordinated and streamlined approach to our operations. We aggressively reduced costs across the enterprise and we’re on track to exceed our initial goal of $5.5 billion in savings. And perhaps most importantly, we’ve improved our DTC operating income by roughly $1 billion in just three quarters, as we continue to work toward achieving DTC profitability by the end of fiscal 2024.”Given all the recent changes and difficulties Disney has faced, you might wonder about their least successful movie.

This involved subtracting the total production and marketing costs from the overall revenue generated by each movie. These calculations were then used to rank the movies in ascending order based on their financial losses.Read also 25 Most Profitable TV Shows of All Time.15 Worst Performing Disney Animated Movies of All Time Here is the list of 15 worst-performing Disney animated movies of all time. 15. Alice in Wonderland (1951)Estimated Financial Loss: $0.6 Million ""Alice in Wonderland"" didn't just barely make a small amount of profit, it actually caused Disney to lose money. This movie didn't just confuse people in the United States, where it wasn't very well known. It also got strong criticism in the U.K. because it messed up Lewis Carroll's books. Unlike before, this time there was no war or other outside reasons to blame for the movie doing badly. Even though Disney himself really liked Carroll's work, he took the blame for the movie not having enough emotion and for its messy story. 14. Sleeping BeautyEstimated Financial Loss: $0.7 MillionAlthough now widely acknowledged as one of Disney's finest and most artistically accomplished animated works, back in 1959, it failed to captivate audiences at the box office. Furthermore, it marked Disney's costliest and most advanced film at that point in time. Following its release, the studio faced its first financial loss in a decade, prompting a restructuring of its animation division and significant workforce reductions. Sleeping Beauty's reputation as a pinnacle of Disney's initial animation era (technically part of the ""Silver Age"") partly stems from this juncture, as the studio began prioritizing cost-cutting and streamlined budgets. The effects of this shift were evident.13. Pinocchio (1940)Estimated Financial Loss: 1.2 Million Following the triumph of Walt Disney's inaugural animated feature, Snow White And The Seven Dwarfs, matching its success was no easy feat. During its initial run in theaters, Pinocchio found itself overshadowed by its forerunner. The studio faced a considerable setback, incurring a $1.2 million loss (a significant sum in 1940) owing to the disruption of overseas theater access due to the onset of World War II. Despite these discouraging outcomes, Disney, undeterred, pressed on with his subsequent grand project.12. Teacher’s Pet Estimated Financial Loss: $4 Million Teacher's Pet (2004) is recognized as a box office disappointment. Weak marketing efforts likely played a role in its lackluster performance. Despite positive feedback from critics, the movie's promotional campaign struggled to generate audience enthusiasm. With a budget of $10 million, it managed to collect only $6 million at the box office. This subpar outcome led to financial setbacks for the studio.11. Home on the Range Estimated Financial Loss: $7 Million Home on the Range didn't excel in box office performance, but it did earn sufficient money to offset its production and marketing expenses. Although not on par with certain Disney movies, the film's debut weekend in the United States and Canada brought in $13,880,771.10. The Rescuers Down Under (1990)Estimated financial Loss: $10 Million This not-so-great sequel didn't make much money when it first came out, only $3.5 million. Disney's boss, Jeffrey Katzenberg, stopped showing ads on TV to try to help, but it didn't work. People kind of saw this coming because even the original movie from 1977 didn't do well when it was re-released in 1989. But by then, they were already making the sequel, so Disney had to accept that they were going to lose money.9. The Return to OZ Estimated Financial Loss: $17 Million The movie disappointed both critics and viewers, bringing in a mere $11 million at the domestic box office. Return to Oz serves as a dark and gritty sequel to The Wizard of Oz, possibly not resonating well with younger audiences or parents. Its somber content and tone contrasted with earlier Disney releases, potentially contributing to its lackluster performance on the big screen.8. Fantasia Estimated Financial Loss: $20 Million Fantasia, a 1940 American animated musical anthology, was crafted by Walt Disney Productions. Remarkably influential and a milestone in animated filmmaking, it unexpectedly faced box office failure upon release. Despite its cultural significance, the movie cost $2,280,000 to create, with $400,000 dedicated solely to its music. Disney ambitiously embraced widescreen production, multiplane Technicolor, and the innovative Fantasound, utilizing a new four-track optical stereophonic system. However, due to World War II restrictions on electronic equipment, Fantasia couldn't regain its substantial investment at the box office.7. The Black Cloudron Estimated Financial Loss: $21 Million Produced by Walt Disney Feature Animation, The Black Cauldron is a 1985 American animated dark fantasy adventure. However, during its first release, the movie managed a mere $21 million in the United States and Canada, falling short of recovering its $44 million production expense. This lackluster showing greatly impacted the company's finances. In the same year, the film came out alongside other notable animated releases such as The Care Bears Movie and The Return of the Living Dead.6. The Good Dinasour Estimated Financial Loss: $28 Million The Good Dinosaur made $332.2 million globally at the box office, which might appear significant. Yet, it didn't meet the anticipated Pixar standards. When considering the costs of making and promoting the film, it wasn't able to turn a profit. Released in the same year as hits like Inside Out and Minions, the movie faced strong competition. Regrettably, it became Pixar's initial film to incur losses at the box office. With its weak performance and elevated expenses, Disney faced financial setbacks.Click to continue reading and see the 5 Worst-performing Disney Animated Movies of all Time.Suggested Articles:30 Best TV Shows of All Time25 Best TV Shows on Hulu in 202315 Most Watched TV Shows Of 2023Disclosure: None. 15 Worst Performing Disney Animated Movies of all Time is originally published on Insider Monkey]"

This means that the dividend yield is 1.6%, which is a bit low when comparing to other companies in the industry. Check out our latest analysis for Devon Energy Devon Energy's Earnings Easily Cover The DistributionsWhile yield is important, another factor to consider about a company's dividend is whether the current payout levels are feasible. Prior to this announcement, Devon Energy's dividend was comfortably covered by both cash flow and earnings. This indicates that quite a large proportion of earnings is being invested back into the business.EPS is set to fall by 16.7% over the next 12 months. If the dividend continues along the path it has been on recently, we estimate the payout ratio could be 67%, which is comfortable for the company to continue in the future.historic-dividendDividend VolatilityThe company's dividend history has been marked by instability, with at least one cut in the last 10 years. There hasn't been much of a change in the dividend over the last 10 years. The dividend has seen some fluctuations in the past, so even though the dividend was raised this year, we should remember that it has been cut in the past.The Dividend Looks Likely To GrowGrowing earnings per share could be a mitigating factor when considering the past fluctuations in the dividend. It's encouraging to see that Devon Energy has been growing its earnings per share at 49% a year over the past five years. The company's earnings per share has grown rapidly in recent years, and it has a good balance between reinvesting and paying dividends to shareholders, so we think that Devon Energy could prove to be a strong dividend payer.Devon Energy Looks Like A Great Dividend StockIt is generally not great to see the dividend being cut, but we don't think this should happen much if at all in the future given that Devon Energy has the makings of a solid income stock moving forward. Reducing the amount it is paying as a dividend can protect the company's balance sheet, keeping the dividend sustainable for longer. Taking this all into consideration, this looks like it could be a good dividend opportunity.Companies possessing a stable dividend policy will likely enjoy greater investor interest than those suffering from a more inconsistent approach. Meanwhile, despite the importance of dividend payments, they are not the only factors our readers should know when assessing a company.

On the one hand, investment banks are signaling that oil prices will increase for the remainder of 2023. Yet, on the other hand, the International Energy Agency recently adjusted its global oil demand forecast downward on macroeconomic headwinds.Despite those mixed signals, it remains fairly easy to identify firms that are already suffering. Several firms are doing significantly worse than they were a year ago. The decline in oil revenues has been sharp, and many firms have fared much worse. Let’s discuss a few of those firms and a non-oil stock that is a clear sell.Shell (SHEL)logo on a gas station in Iceland.Source: JuliusKielaitis / Shutterstock.comShell (NYSE:SHEL) stock isn’t as credible as it once was. One of the hallmarks of big oil is dependable dividends. Investors rely on dividend income to smooth the volatility inherent to the sector as oil prices shift and affect earnings.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsSo, when a firm of Shell’s size reduces its dividend, it quickly joins the list of energy stocks to sell. Shell did precisely that in 2022. Further, Shell’s dividend growth rate over the prevailing five years sits at -16%. That rightly makes investors hesitant and will continue to plague the firm.Investors are likely on alert because Shell’s earnings fell to $5 billion in Q2. It was well below the $11.5 billion in earnings a year earlier and worse than the $5.8 billion Wall Street was expecting. Shell increased its dividend by 15% in Q2. That likely alleviates some of the fear around its shares. However, almost everything is headed in the wrong direction for the firm. Lower oil prices and LNG prices are hurting the firm.Devon Energy (DVN)The logo for Devon Energy (DVN) is displayed on a sign outside an office.Source: Jeff Whyte / Shutterstock.comDevon Energy (NYSE:DVN) proves that 2023 is much more difficult for oil stocks than 2022. Devon Energy’s problems are almost all attributable to dwindling dividends. It’s as simple as that. Like Shell and other energy firms, declining dividends mean declining income for investors. And if you pay investors less, they become much more likely to flee.Story continuesThat’s precisely what’s happening to Devon Energy — investors are bailing out as the company has drastically reduced its dividend over the last year. Peak oil prices were a bonanza for energy firms in 2022. However, peaks are followed by declines. Devon Energy paid a $1.55 dividend a year ago. It has reduced it during the four subsequent quarters.Investors will receive a $0.49 dividend this quarter. A year earlier, that dividend paid $1.35. That trajectory makes it increasingly difficult for DVN shares to move upward anytime soon and makes it one of the best energy stocks to sell.Nikola (NKLA)Nikola (NKLA) Tre BEV electric truck at the Hannover IAA Transportation Motor Show. GermanySource: VanderWolf Images / Shutterstock.comNikola (NASDAQ:NKLA) is a different type of energy stock but one to jettison nonetheless. I’m not referring to Nikola as an energy stock because it develops EV trucks. Rather, I’m referring to Nikola’s foray into hydrogen. The company has invested in building hydrogen infrastructure as it pivots from its past issues.That said, Nikola remains an EV truck firm first and foremost. It manufactured 33 trucks in Q2 and shipped 45. That equated to a modest $15.36 million in sales, including non-truck revenues. There’s been some progress, if slow. It’s just that Nikola is losing so much money that there’s no way to justify doing anything but steering clear altogether. Nikola tallied $26 million in sales during the first half of 2023. Those sales led to a loss of nearly $387 million. Kudos to Nikola for continuing on after the Trevor Milton fiasco, but it still isn’t worth investing in the company.The amount of money Nikola losses relative to its revenues is an astonishingly high ratio. It’s difficult to imagine that Nikola will continue to operate for much longer at this rate. Thus, that’s why I think it is one of the top energy stocks to sell.On the date of publication, Alex Sirois did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

Knowing whether insiders are buying is usually more helpful when evaluating insider transactions, as insider selling can have various explanations. However, if numerous insiders are selling, shareholders should investigate more.While we would never suggest that investors should base their decisions solely on what the directors of a company have been doing, we would consider it foolish to ignore insider transactions altogether. See our latest analysis for McDonald's McDonald's Insider Transactions Over The Last YearIn the last twelve months, the biggest single sale by an insider was when the insider, Manuel Steijaert, sold US$1.0m worth of shares at a price of US$296 per share. So we know that an insider sold shares at around the present share price of US$285. While insider selling is a negative, to us, it is more negative if the shares are sold at a lower price. We note that this sale took place at around the current price, so it isn't a major concern, though it's hardly a good sign.All up, insiders sold more shares in McDonald's than they bought, over the last year. The chart below shows insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last year. If you click on the chart, you can see all the individual transactions, including the share price, individual, and the date!insider-trading-volumeI will like McDonald's better if I see some big insider buys. While we wait, check out this free list of growing companies with considerable, recent, insider buying.Insiders At McDonald's Have Sold Stock RecentlyThe last quarter saw substantial insider selling of McDonald's shares. In total, insiders sold US$1.4m worth of shares in that time, and we didn't record any purchases whatsoever. This may suggest that some insiders think that the shares are not cheap.Story continuesInsider OwnershipAnother way to test the alignment between the leaders of a company and other shareholders is to look at how many shares they own. I reckon it's a good sign if insiders own a significant number of shares in the company. It's great to see that McDonald's insiders own 0.2% of the company, worth about US$374m. I like to see this level of insider ownership, because it increases the chances that management are thinking about the best interests of shareholders.So What Does This Data Suggest About McDonald's Insiders?Insiders sold stock recently, but they haven't been buying. Despite some insider buying, the longer term picture doesn't make us feel much more positive. But it is good to see that McDonald's is growing earnings. It is good to see high insider ownership, but the insider selling leaves us cautious. In addition to knowing about insider transactions going on, it's beneficial to identify the risks facing McDonald's. In terms of investment risks, we've identified 1 warning sign with McDonald's and understanding it should be part of your investment process.If you would prefer to check out another company -- one with potentially superior financials -- then do not miss this free list of interesting companies, that have HIGH return on equity and low debt.For the purposes of this article, insiders are those individuals who report their transactions to the relevant regulatory body.

If you want to skip our detailed discussion on the self storage and apartment industry, head directly to 5 Best Self Storage and Apartment Stocks To Buy Now. According to PwC, the real estate sector is looking past traditional challenges like fluctuating interest rates, a decrease in GDP, and reduced deal opportunities. Instead, it's adopting a more forward-looking strategy towards real estate assets. Real estate experts exude a sense of careful optimism. Their strategy involves riding the existing slump while strategically preparing their companies for a future phase of consistent expansion and favorable financial outcomes. Valued at approximately $2.53 billion in 2023, the residential real estate market in the United States is projected to reach nearly $2.80 billion by 2028, as reported by Mordor Intelligence. This indicates a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of around 2.04% throughout the forecast period from 2023 to 2028. The prevailing trend of inflation in the country has deeply influenced businesses. Elevated inflation rates have prompted individuals to allocate more funds towards essential needs like sustenance and attire, concurrently impacting the real estate sector focused on home ownership. Since the COVID-19 pandemic, a multitude of buyers have capitalized on the favorable low interest rates to modify their home loans, move to new locations, or buy their first homes. As a result, there was a notable surge in home sales during the latter part of 2020, and this heightened level has persisted beyond the pre-pandemic period. Prior to the pandemic's onset, home values had been ascending, but with a remarkable surge in demand in 2020, the Freddie Mac House Price Index registered a staggering 11.3% escalation. Additionally, during the final quarter of 2021, a surplus of 142,406 housing units were accessible to address consumer needs, with more than 89% of these units being occupied by homeowners and renters. Moreover, the majority of transactions within this domain stem from citizens categorized as middle-aged and elderly. For example, individuals aged between 45 and 65 years represented over 70% of the country's homeownership rates throughout the four quarters of 2021. A substantial portion of the demand within this sector is fueled by condominiums and apartments. Apartments are projected to dominate this landscape compared to condominiums, as evidenced by the completion of 64,000 apartment units during the second quarter of 2021.Story continuesDon't Miss: 11 Most Undervalued REIT Stocks to Buy On the other hand, as per a separate report by Mordor Intelligence, the self-storage market in the United States is projected to increase from $43.34 billion in 2023 to approximately $48.73 billion by 2028, reflecting a CAGR of 2.37% within the forecast period. Owing to swift urbanization in the United States, the demand for self-storage facilities is on the rise. In 2020, as much as 82.66% of the population resided in urban regions, and projections indicate a surge to 89.16% by 2050. Consequently, the necessity for storage options is becoming increasingly urgent. Self-storage providers are capitalizing on this trend by constructing facilities in densely inhabited zones. This demand stems from multiple influences, including the prevalence of compact living spaces in heavily populated areas and individuals opting to move to smaller residences. Favorable economic momentum, including faster job establishment, elevated levels of confidence, and an increase in the number of households, is bolstering the self-storage industry. However, the expansion of the self storage market is at times hindered by government regulations. Also Read: 15 Worst Performing REITs in 2023Big moves are happening in the self storage industry. For example, in April 2023, Extra Space Storage Inc. (NYSE:EXR) announced its intention to purchase Life Storage for $12.7 billion. This acquisition will lead to the newly formed company becoming the largest operator of self-storage spaces in the U.S. in terms of the number of stores. The all-stock deal will effectively value the merged company at approximately $36 billion. This merger is set to bring about significant expansion and cost-cutting opportunities for both Extra Space and Life Storage, as stated by Extra Space. Some experts anticipate further consolidation within the self storage industry.The current market performance can be a motivator for investors to consider the best self storage and apartment stocks.

(NASDAQ:WSC), Prologis, Inc. (NYSE:PLD), and U-Haul Holding Company (NYSE:UHAL), UDR, Inc. (NYSE:UDR) is one of the best self storage and apartment stocks to invest in. 11.

(NYSE:COLD) in its Q2 2022 investor letter:“Americold Realty Trust contributed to our performance this quarter. Americold is a large owner/operator of cold storage facilities. The stock had lagged because of two issues: first, frozen food manufacturers and their customers had labor issues that restricted production and thus the need for storage; and second, the company had execution issues. It seems like industry trends are improving. Plus, the company is making progress increasing its productivity and improving margins, somewhat from the effect of hiring some new senior executives.The stability of the business and the fact that it pays a nice dividend as a REIT is a positive in this market. Even after its recent pickup, we think the stock still trades at a modest cap rate and well below its private market value, so the stock can work via growth and multiple expansion.”10.

The stock has pulled back significantly, which is not surprising given the deteriorating fundamentals in real estate amid rising interest rates and cap rates. We viewed this as an opportunity to purchase a high-quality REIT at a discounted valuation.Giving us added confidence: Storage REITs are among the best performers in the real estate sector, with net operating income margins north of 70% and the lowest recurring capital requirements. We also like the fact that NSA’s insiders share in our optimism. Late last year, National Storage’s executive chairman/founder and three directors were significant buyers of the stock.”9.

To skip the detailed analysis of Warren Buffett’s investment strategy and his latest bets, you can go directly to Warren Buffett's Recent Buys: Top 3 Stocks.The CEO of Berkshire Hathaway, Warren Edward Buffett, is the most successful investor in the world. He is the highest paid hedge fund manager of all time and has a net worth of $118.3 billion as of August 23, 2023. Warren Buffett’s net worth is way less than what it would have been if he had kept the money to himself. Along with his close friend Bill Gates, he launched the Giving Pledge program in 2010, where they asked billionaires to donate at least 50% of their wealth to charitable causes. Buffett himself has given away $51 billion to such causes. He has pledged to donate 99% of his wealth to charity after his death.Warren Buffett was born in Omaha and due to his lifetime of success, he has been named the ‘Oracle of Omaha’. He was born to the US congressman, Howard Buffett, who has been a major influence on his life. He liked math since his school days and under his high-school yearbook entry, it was written: ""likes math; a future stockbroker."" Warren Buffett had a knack for business from a young age. He started his career at a very young age by selling chewing gum, Coca-Cola, and magazines. He started investing in the stock market at the age of 11 and filed taxes at the age of 13.Every successful hedge fund manager has their own investing strategy. Warren Buffett likes to pay close attention to companies’ fundamentals and buys them for the long term. His value investing strategy is dependent on earnings and dividend accruement over the years. One of his famous quotes about his investment strategy is:""Nobody buys a farm based on whether they think it's going to rain next year. They buy it because they think it's a good investment over 10 or 20 years.""Story continuesWarren Buffett is not a big fan of portfolio diversification. In Q2 2023, over 91% of Berkshire Hathaway’s portfolio was represented by the firm’s top 10 stock picks. Over half of Berkshire’s portfolio is covered by one company, Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), which the firm has owned since the first quarter of 2016. At that time, the average price of Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)’s stock was $24.91 and it reached over $174 by Q2 2023. Here is what Warren Buffett says about portfolio diversification:""Wide diversification is only required when investors do not understand what they are doing.""Warren Buffett’s Latest BetsIn the second quarter of 2023, Berkshire Hathaway’s 13F portfolio was worth a staggering $348.194 billion, compared to nearly $325.109 billion in the previous quarter. The firm purchased 3 new stocks in the quarter and increased holdings in two. The firm closed out 3 stocks including Vitesse Energy, Inc. (NYSE:VTS) which Berkshire Hathaway had bought in the first quarter of 2023. Furthermore, the hedge fund decreased holdings in 5 stocks in the second quarter of 2023.In the second quarter, Warren Buffett made all his new bets on the home construction segment. Home construction companies might be seeing a positive run as new home purchase mortgage applications increased by 35.5% in July. On July 14th, Raymond James also upgraded several home construction stocks including Lennar Corporation (NYSE:LEN), which is one of Mr. Buffett’s latest buys. Analyst Buck Horne said:""We are keenly aware that the optics of turning more positive on homebuilders after the group has already achieved a new all-time high is far from ideal[...]But we must always reassess what we missed earlier.""Horne emphasized coming up with a new valuation approach as his team was late in discerning the bottled-up demand for single-family homes added to the “proven resilience of builders' de-risked operating models.”It looks like Wall Street analysts also agree with Warren Buffett’s bets which isn’t a surprise. Some of his top picks include Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), Bank of America Corporation (NYSE:BAC), and American Express Company (NYSE:AXP).

(NYSE:NVR).NVR is one of the largest homebuilders in the US, operating in over 30 markets. There are several attributes that are underappreciated about NVR. First and foremost, it’s not your normal land-owning homebuilder: NVR options their land which leads to outsized returns and less risk by having less capital tied up in land. Many homebuilders cite the positives of owning land such as more control over the entire building process and higher margins.NVR mitigates the lack of control inherent in their option strategy by working extremely closely with local land developers. These partners appreciate NVR’s trustworthiness, pristine balance sheet and quick turnarounds. As one developer tells me, “They do what they say they’ll do and they honor their commitments to buy a set number of lots.” While owning land may lead to higher margins during most economic times, it takes up much capital and is incredibly illiquid. It’s also likely worth much less during tougher economic times…exactly when you might want to have more cash on hand…” (Click here to read the full text) Click to continue reading and see Warren Buffett's Recent Buys: Top 3 Stocks. Suggested articles:20 Most Consumed Candies in the US11 Most Undervalued Renewable Energy Stocks to BuyWarren Buffett and Insiders Love These StocksDisclosure.

We have also covered the top companies for project managers along with their global impact. If you want to skip our detailed analysis, head straight to the 5 Highest Paying Countries for Project Managers.Is Project Management Still in Demand in 2023?According to a PMI-commissioned talent gap analysis by Anderson Economic Group, in the next decade, demand for Project Management Professionals (PMPs) is set to outpace other jobs, with a 33% growth in the project management-oriented labor force which will create 22 million jobs by 2027. This translates into a staggering 88 million individuals to fulfill these vacancies in project management roles by then. China and India will together contribute over 75% of this demand. It is also important to highlight that these PMPs aren't just numbers – their impact on productivity is substantial. Shortages in this field could pose GDP risks of around $208 billion across 11 countries in the next 10 years. Generally, the highest paid project managers are Project Executives and PMO Leads with a salary range of $143,000-$194,500 and $130,000-$190,000 respectively.How Crucial is Project Management for Corporations?Project management is vital for corporations due to its ability to ensure efficient resource allocation, timely execution, and successful achievement of objectives. In complex business environments, projects often involve multiple stakeholders, intricate tasks, and tight budgets that make effective project management indispensable.Effective project management is essential to mitigate risks and ensure project success. However, statistics reveal the grave consequences of neglecting it. Around 70% of all projects fail and thus, lead to wasted resources and missed opportunities. Companies that undervalue project management see a 50% increase in project failures. A staggering 55% of project managers cite budget overruns as a reason for failure, resulting in financial losses. Story continuesA prime example is Boeing Co (NYSE:BA)'s 787 Dreamliner project.

Delays, cost overruns, and supply chain issues resulted in huge financial losses. However, when Boeing Co (NYSE:BA) addressed these issues and revamped their project management approach, they successfully delivered subsequent projects like the 737 MAX.Similarly, the launch of the iPhone by Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) serves as another example of the importance of project management. Effective project management played a crucial role in orchestrating the collaboration between hardware and software teams which ensured that the product's launch was timely and seamless. This led to a revolutionary product that has transformed the smartphone industry in an unprecedented manner. Top Companies for Project ManagementHoneywell International, Inc (NASDAQ:HON) stands as a pivotal player in project management that consistently leads in the execution of groundbreaking projects and initiatives globally.

82,201b6426-e16f-3dda-86b1-f65e02551db2,NTAP,2023-08-27,NetApp (NASDAQ:NTAP) Is Due To Pay A Dividend Of $0.50,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/netapp-nasdaq-ntap-due-pay-121357378.html,1693138437,STORY,['NTAP'],"[NetApp, Inc. (NASDAQ:NTAP) will pay a dividend of $0.50 on the 25th of October. The dividend yield will be 2.7% based on this payment which is still above the industry average. Check out our latest analysis for NetApp NetApp's Earnings Easily Cover The DistributionsIf the payments aren't sustainable, a high yield for a few years won't matter that much. However, NetApp's earnings easily cover the dividend. This means that most of its earnings are being retained to grow the business.Looking forward, earnings per share is forecast to fall by 14.1% over the next year. If the dividend continues along recent trends, we estimate the payout ratio could be 48%, which we consider to be quite comfortable, with most of the company's earnings left over to grow the business in the future.historic-dividendNetApp Has A Solid Track RecordEven over a long history of paying dividends, the company's distributions have been remarkably stable. Since 2013, the dividend has gone from $0.60 total annually to $2.00. This means that it has been growing its distributions at 13% per annum over that time. Rapidly growing dividends for a long time is a very valuable feature for an income stock.The Dividend Looks Likely To GrowSome investors will be chomping at the bit to buy some of the company's stock based on its dividend history. It's encouraging to see that NetApp has been growing its earnings per share at 41% a year over the past five years. Earnings have been growing rapidly, and with a low payout ratio we think that the company could turn out to be a great dividend stock.We Really Like NetApp's DividendOverall, we think that this is a great income investment, and we think that maintaining the dividend this year may have been a conservative choice. The distributions are easily covered by earnings, and there is plenty of cash being generated as well. We should point out that the earnings are expected to fall over the next 12 months, which won't be a problem if this doesn't become a trend, but could cause some turbulence in the next year. All in all, this checks a lot of the boxes we look for when choosing an income stock.Market movements attest to how highly valued a consistent dividend policy is compared to one which is more unpredictable. Still, investors need to consider a host of other factors, apart from dividend payments, when analysing a company. Taking the debate a bit further, we've identified 1 warning sign for NetApp that investors need to be conscious of moving forward. Looking for more high-yielding dividend ideas?

83,abf0920c-969a-3bff-83f3-edb523f9b2ee,MDLZ,2023-08-27,7 Stocks to Buy Ahead of a 2024 Recession,InvestorPlace,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/7-stocks-buy-ahead-2024-100026930.html,1692612026,STORY,"['SYY', 'PEP', 'DG', 'DUK', 'CLX', 'MDLZ', 'FLO']","[With concerns growing about the possibility of a 2024 recession, it’s prudent to tilt your portfolio in a more conservative direction as we head into 2024.Currently, the 10-Year Treasury Constant Maturity Minus the 2-Year Treasury Constant Maturity chart displays a risky trajectory. But let me explain what this chart is first – it measures the difference between the yields of two U.S. Treasury securities with different maturities. The 10-2 year Treasury yield spread is often used as an indicator of the yield curve’s shape and the economy’s direction. A positive spread means that the 10-year Treasury yield is higher than the 2-year Treasury yield, which implies that investors expect higher inflation and greater economic growth in the future. Conversely, A negative spread means that the 2-year Treasury yield is higher than the 10-year Treasury yield, which implies that investors expect lower inflation and economic growth in the future. This yield curve is inverted right now.That’s not inherently a bad thing. What is bad is when that inverted yield curve starts spiking back to normalcy again. This has been a prelude to almost every major recession, including the Covid downturn and the technical recession (two quarters of negative GDP growth) in Q1 2022 and Q2 2022. Right now, we do have a strong labor market to counteract these recessionary fears, but with the economy starting to digest the rate hikes, the labor market is softening.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsOf course, predicting recessions is notoriously difficult, and it’s entirely possible the economy may surpass expectations in 2024. Nevertheless, adding some exposure to recession-resistant stocks seems sensible, given the uncertain macro outlook. At a minimum, these stocks can provide ballast to portfolios in choppy markets while still offering solid return potential over the long-run. Let’s dive in.Flowers Foods (FLO)bakery breads, buns and pastries on a wooden cutting board in a display caseSource: shutterstock.com/ampersandphotoStory continuesIf you’re hunting for stability, you can’t go wrong with a classic defensive name like Flowers Foods (NYSE:FLO). This baked goods stalwart boasts a track record of growing sales and dividends consistently over the years, even through the pandemic. The company’s brands like Nature’s Own and Dave’s Killer Bread enjoy tremendous consumer loyalty.While costs are rising across the industry, Flowers has implemented smart pricing moves to offset inflation. And its strategy is working – the company just delivered 9% sales growth last quarter, trouncing estimates. For 2023, analysts see steady mid-single-digit top-line gains continuing. When folks get nervous, they still buy bread.Additionally, with shares down 11% this year, investors can grab Flowers’ defensive profile at a reasonable price. At 20-times forward earnings and with a 3.7% dividend yield, FLO stock offers a tasty recipe for stability and income. This company’s fundamentals never go stale.Clorox (CLX)Clorox bleach bottles lined up on a store shelf.Source: TY Lim / Shutterstock.comAs economic outlooks cloud over, Clorox (NYSE:CLX) stands out as a relatively safe play in the consumer space. The company is hitting its stride in 2023 after a tough 2022 when waning pandemic demand and supply issues plagued performance.But now, Clorox is back with a vengeance. Last quarter, the company grew sales by 12% behind brand powerhouses like its namesake Bleach and Glad. Management sees high single-digit earnings per share growth continuing next fiscal year. As management says, “we expect stronger growth in the front half as we continue to lap the two price increases that we have. And then in the back half, we expect it to get tougher for consumers. And right now, our expectation is a mild recession.” Thus, management seems prepared for the possibility of a 2024 recession, even if it is a mild one.While CLX stock isn’t crazy cheap, defensive stocks seldom are these days. I’m happy to pay up for the safety and growth in times like these.Sysco (SYY)Best Stocks for Students: Sysco (SYY)Source: ShutterstockSysco (NYSE:SYY) stock declined a little this year, but the rout feels overdone. Shares of SYY stock are down more than 20% in 2022, despite Sysco churning out record sales and profits last quarter. As the market leader in U.S. food distribution, Sysco enjoys immense scale advantages that breed stability.Sure, food inflation poses challenges on margins, but Sysco boasts the pricing power to offset those headwinds. Analysts see revenue growth continuing at a 4.3% clip in fiscal 2023. And even after its steep haircut this year, they still see nearly 20% upside in the stock.With its 1.9% dividend yield, Sysco gives investors a chance to gain stable exposure to defensive food distribution at a now-reasonable valuation. The crowd may have overreacted on this one, making now a good time to nibble.Dollar General (DG)Dollar General (DG) store front with yellow store sign, middaySource: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.comWhen economic dread sets in, discount retailers like Dollar General (NYSE:DG) get their chance to shine. Catering squarely to budget-minded shoppers, Dollar General enjoys powerful recession resilience. Its incredible store growth and market share gains have continued this year, even as its stock sank over 37% amid margin pressures.But don’t count Dollar General out. Analysts see a sales growing at a compound rate of roughly 12% annually over this decade. And they expect its beaten-down stock to power forward nearly 20%. DG’s extreme value focus never goes out of favor in tough times, especially when pennies get pinched.With shares substantially discounted already, I think Dollar General looks like a relative bargain here for investors seeking safety. Its defensive attributes should cushion any portfolio in a downturn.Duke Energy (DUK)5 Utility Stocks to Buy for an Extra Durable PortfolioSource: ShutterstockDo you know what sector gets dubbed “recession-proof” when economic anxieties strike? Utilities. Providers like Duke Energy (NYSE:DUK) enjoy very steady demand profiles and operate under the safety net of regulation. While Duke isn’t immune to impacts like weather and higher interest costs, its advantages abound.Remarkably, Duke’s stock proved resilient last year, down just 2% compared to the broader market carnage. Now, DUK stock did fall nearly 12% this year, but still offers a secure 4.5% dividend yield. Duke’s growth outlook has dimmed near term, but analysts still see ~7% year-over-year earnings growth over the long haul.Given that Duke has already taken quite the beating from this year’s storm, I think its upside/downside skew looks attractive. This utility giant should keep charging forward reliably for years to come, making it a cornerstone holding.PepsiCo (PEP)Cans of PepsiCo's Pepsi soda are in a bucket of ice.Source: suriyachan / Shutterstock.comPepsiCo’s (NYSE:PEP) massive brand portfolio, including Pepsi, Frito-Lay, and Quaker Oats, provides immense consumer reach and recession resilience. This snacking and beverage empire simply has no rivals matching its scale and geographic diversification. Pepsi recently delivered 10.4% sales growth, continuing to gain market share as consumers scrambled for indulgent snacks to lift spirits.Is PEP stock pricey at 24-times earnings? Sure. But safety has its price. And analysts still see 13% upside here.Between its 2.8% dividend and steady mid-single-digit profit growth, I’m happily nibbling on Pepsi stock for ballast.Mondelez (MDLZ)The Mondelez website magnified by a magnifying glassSource: ShutterstockLike PepsiCo, Mondelez (NASDAQ:MDLZ) offers global snacking powerhouse status, making it a relatively safe bet if a 2024 recession strikes. With brands like Oreo, Ritz, and Cadbury under its belt, Mondelez reaches billions of treat-seeking consumers worldwide.The company just delivered 17% sales growth in its Q2 results. Pricing actions fueled the gains, highlighting the loyalty its brands command. With MDLZ stock down modestly this year, its 22-times price-earnings ratio looks reasonable for a name of this quality.Analysts see above-average earnings growth continuing for Mondelez, forecasting 15% upside with this consumer discretionary giant. It’s not the flashiest pick, but for investors seeking exposure to defensive sectors, Mondelez looks tasty at current levels.On the date of publication, Omor Ibne Ehsan did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

84,1f57d268-b434-3314-8be3-ebf385c0ae9b,OXY,2023-08-27,The 3 Most Undervalued Oil Stocks to Buy Now: August 2023,InvestorPlace,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/3-most-undervalued-oil-stocks-104250729.html,1692614570,STORY,"['CVX', 'OXY']","[Oil stocks have been subdued in the last few quarters. This does not come as a surprise with Brent oil trending lower after making a higher of $120 in 2022. The downside in oil has been due to tight monetary policies that have impacted global GDP growth.It however seems that the worst of the correction for oil is over. Currently, Brent oil trades at $80 and it’s expected that oil will average $82.62 for the year. Further, Brent is likely to increase to $86.48 next year. Given the production cut by OPEC and allies coupled with a stable GDP growth outlook, it’s a good time to invest in undervalued oil stocks.An important point to note is that there are talks about the fall in demand for oil due to renewable energy sources. However, it’s worth noting that in 2019, fossil fuels share as a primary energy source was 80%. This will gradually trend lower, but it’s too early to believe that the demand for oil will plunge.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsLet’s discuss three undervalued oil stocks to buy and hold.Chevron Corporation (CVX)Chevron logo on blue sign in front of skyscraper buildingSource: Jeff Whyte / Shutterstock.comChevron Corporation (NYSE:CVX) stock is among the undervalued oil stocks to accumulate. Even with the decline in oil price, CVX stock has remained sideways in the last 12 months. A dividend yield of 3.81% is also attractive and I expect sustained dividend growth.From a fundamental perspective, an investment grade balance sheet is a key reason to like Chevron. This positions the company for aggressive organic and acquisition-driven growth. Recently, the company acquired PDC Energy. This acquisition would add more than 1 billion barrels of oil equivalent proved reserves.Chevron has also committed to investing $13 to $15 billion annually over the next few years. This will ensure that reserve replacement remains robust. It’s worth noting that if oil remains above $80 per barrel, the company’s low break-even assets are positioned to generate operating cash flow in excess of $30 billion. This provides ample headroom for dividend growth and share repurchase.Story continuesAker BP ASA (AKRBF)Panorama of Oil and Gas central processing platform in twilight, offshore hard work occupation twenty four working hours. Best oil stocks to buySource: Oil and Gas Photographer / Shutterstock.comAker BP ASA (OTCMKTS:AKRBF) stock is among the oil stocks that are still under the radar. AKRBF stock looks significantly undervalued and offers an attractive dividend yield of 9.96%.As an overview, Aker BP is an oil and gas exploration company with a focus on the Norwegian Continental Shelf. The company has some prized assets with a low breakeven. Aker BP has therefore been delivering robust cash flows even with the correction in oil.To put things into perspective, Aker BP reported a realized oil price of $75 per barrel in Q2 2023. For the period, the company reported revenue and EBITDA of $3.3 and $3 billion respectively. Once oil trends are higher, the company will be positioned to deliver robust free cash flows.It’s also worth noting that Aker BP has an investment-grade balance sheet. As of Q2 2023, the company reported a liquidity buffer of $6.1 billion. Aker has a history of growth through acquisitions. Considering the financial flexibility, I believe that potential inorganic growth will accelerate value creation.Occidental Petroleum (OXY)Person holding cellphone with logo of American company Occidental Petroleum Corp.

Schneider / Shutterstock.comOccidental Petroleum (NYSE:OXY) stock has been in the limelight with Warren Buffett on an aggressive buying spree. OXY stock has remained resilient in the last 12 months backed by positive fundamental developments. I believe that the 1.15% dividend yield stock will be a long-term value creator and is trading at a valuation gap.In a recent development, Occidental announced the acquisition of Carbon Engineering for a consideration of $1.1 billion. The latter is in the business of capturing carbon dioxide out of the atmosphere, which can be stored deep underground or used to produce clean energy. I believe that the clean energy segment will be significant for Occidental in the next five years.In the core oil and gas business, Occidental will continue to create value. For Q2 2023, the company reported a free cash flow of $1 billion. The company already has an investment-grade balance sheet and plans to continue deleveraging. With quality Permian assets, cash flows will support growth and value creation.On the date of publication, Faisal Humayun did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

The study is the first randomized clinical trial to directly compare the efficacy and safety of the FARAPULSE PFA System against standard-of-care ablation – either radiofrequency or cryoablation – for the treatment of patients with paroxysmal, or intermittent, AF. Findings were presented at ESC Congress 2023, the annual meeting of the European Society of Cardiology, and simultaneously published in The New England Journal of Medicine.Boston Scientific Corporation (PRNewsFoto/Boston Scientific Corporation) (PRNewsFoto/Boston Scientific Corporation)Data demonstrated the FARAPULSE PFA System was noninferior to standard-of-care therapies, meeting the primary efficacy and safety endpoints, despite the vast majority of physicians having prior experience solely with thermal ablation.** Of note:Through 12 months, the single-procedure, off-drug treatment success was 73.3% in the PFA arm of the study and 71.3% in the thermal arm, which met the primary efficacy endpoint.The primary composite safety endpoint – defined as acute and chronic device- and procedure-related serious adverse events within seven days of the procedure – was met with a comparably low adverse event rate of 2.1% (six events) in the PFA arm and 1.5% (four events) in the thermal arm.Results demonstrated superiority of the FARAPULSE PFA System in the study's secondary safety endpoint with significantly less post-ablation narrowing of the pulmonary veins at three months (0.9%) compared to the thermal ablation arm (12%).There were statistically shorter ablation times and less variability with the FARAPULSE PFA System within the PFA arm of the study (mean of 29.2 minutes with a standard deviation of 14.3 minutes) compared to the thermal arm (mean of 50.0 minutes with a standard deviation of 24.6 minutes).Story continues""Excellent overall clinical performance of the FARAPULSE PFA System was seen in this study, particularly the high rate of freedom from atrial arrhythmias and the very low rate of safety events, which is impressive given the rigor of the trial design and monitoring protocols utilized,"" said Vivek Reddy, M.D., study principal investigator and electrophysiologist at Mount Sinai Hospital, New York. ""These highly anticipated findings, together with extensive prior data from Europe, solidify PFA therapy with this system as a preferred ablative treatment modality.""In this multicenter, prospective and randomized controlled trial, 607 patients in the U.S. with paroxysmal AF who had previously been unsuccessfully treated with at least one anti-arrhythmic drug were enrolled.""These data underscore the superior procedural efficiency of this novel technology, and real-world use continues to yield strong safety and efficacy outcomes,"" said Kenneth Stein, M.D., senior vice president and global chief medical officer, Boston Scientific. ""The performance of the FARAPULSE PFA System in this trial is an encouraging sign of the potential utilization of the device in the U.S. and we look forward to further studying the system for the treatment of patients with persistent AF in the ADVANTAGE AF clinical trial, which began enrollment earlier this year.""The FARAPULSE PFA System received CE Mark in 2021 and has been used to treat more than 25,000 patients globally to date.More information on the ADVENT clinical trial is available here.About Boston ScientificBoston Scientific transforms lives through innovative medical solutions that improve the health of patients around the world.

You can skip our detailed analysis of the global alcohol industry, and the opportunities for non-alcoholic beverages in countries with a low prevalence of alcohol, and go directly to 5 Countries with the Highest Percentage of Non-Drinkers. Globally, an estimated 35% of men are non-drinkers, while the rate for women is 55%. Alcohol has been outlawed in several countries today, in part or as a whole. All of these countries have a majority Muslim population and have governments that adhere to some form of Islamic law, known as Sharia. In the Islamic religion, two of the most significant prohibitions are eating pork and drinking alcohol. There are about 14 countries that have outlawed alcohol to some degree. The Global Alcohol Industry:In 2019, the global alcohol consumption, measured in liters of pure alcohol per person of 15 years of age or older, was 5.5 liters, which is a 4.7% relative decrease from 5.7 liters in 2010. As we mentioned in our article – Top 20 Alcohol Drinking Countries in the World – the global alcoholic beverages market size was valued at $1.62 trillion in 2021, and the market is projected to reach $2 trillion by 2031, with a CAGR of 2.2% in the forecast period concluding in 2031.Opportunities for Non-Alcoholic Beverages: The low prevalence of alcohol in several Muslim-majority countries leads people to look elsewhere to quench their thirst, presenting opportunities to other non-alcoholic drinks. While the low- and no-alcohol trend is taking off in the Western world, another region which holds opportunities for this sector is the Middle East, where alcohol is banned in many countries. In 2019, Saudi Arabia was recorded to have the sixth-largest global market for alcohol-free beer consumption. Several booze companies have hopped on the zero-alcohol bandwagon, and are now offering products with all of the taste and none of the booze. Budweiser Zero was launched in 2020 by Anheuser-Busch InBev SA/NV (NYSE:BUD) as the company’s first non-alcoholic beer, setting itself up as the industry standard. Anheuser-Busch InBev SA/NV (NYSE:BUD) also reportedly bought the rights to supply the FIFA World Cup for $75 million exclusively last year. Story continuesAs the sale of alcohol is strictly controlled in Qatar, Bud Zero ended up being the only brew available at the stadiums during the whole event. Last month, Anheuser-Busch InBev SA/NV (NYSE:BUD) announced plans to invest $34 million in its Belgian breweries to help expand its portfolio of non-alcoholic beers, improve bottling capacity, and optimize a new non-alcoholic system used to make Corona Cero. Anheuser-Busch InBev SA/NV (NYSE:BUD) is the Largest Beer Producer in the World but the company is facing some headwinds in the American market after the recent controversy regarding its best-selling brand Bud Light, which resulted in the iconic brand losing its crown as the Top-Selling Beer in America. Although, as we mentioned in our article – 20 Countries that Drink the Most Beer per Capita – billionaire Bill Gates’ portfolio managers decided to initiate a $96 million position in the firm during the second quarter. Broyhill Asset Management said the following about Anheuser-Busch InBev SA/NV (NYSE:BUD) in its second quarter 2023 investor letter:“The largest detractors to performance over the quarter were First Horizon Corp (FHN), Anheuser-Busch InBev SA/NV (NYSE:BUD), and Bayer (BAYRY). Problems at Anheuser Busch InBev began on April 1 with Dylan Mulvaney’s social media post, which ignited a fiery backlash amongst Bud Light customers across ‘Merica. With volumes down sharply, and competitors gaining share at BUD’s expense, operational deleveraging is set to weigh heavily on US margins amid peak demand pressure in the second quarter. Despite severe US headwinds (second-quarter operating profit maybe half of last year’s levels), we still expect BUD to grow consolidated operating profit at a mid-single-digit rate for the full year. With current issues well understood and investor sentiment in the gutters, we see significant upside in a stock, which is approaching a double-digit FCF yield. With FX headwinds and rising input costs reversing course, increasing margins are likely to drive positive surprises into FY24 as continued deleveraging accrues more value to shareholders.”Saudi Arabia also leads the Middle Eastern market in terms of its consumption of drinks from the The Coca Cola Company (NYSE:KO), with Palestine not far behind. The Coca Cola Company (NYSE:KO)'s dominance in the Saudi Market is also due, in part, to the company's focus on product innovation and customer-oriented marketing. Over the past few years, the company has been investing heavily in new packaging that allows customers to customize their drinks to their taste preferences. The Coca Cola Company (NYSE:KO) now represents nearly 40% of all carbonated soft drink sales in the Middle East.Sales of PepsiCo, Inc. (NASDAQ:PEP) have traditionally been stronger in the Middle East, due, in part, to an Arab league-imposed boycott on Coca-Cola, which began when the firm decided in 1968 to open a bottling plant in Israel. PepsiCo, Inc. (NASDAQ:PEP) has been focusing on innovation and sustainability in its operations in the region – the company introduced the 'Dawah' bottle in the Middle East to recycle 88% of the water used in its production process. PepsiCo, Inc. (NASDAQ:PEP) also introduced a new beverage package in the Saudi market that is easier to use, recyclable, and doesn't require any water to consume. Similarly, the energy drinks market in the Middle East is one of the most promising in the coming years. It is true that during the pandemic, sales volumes dropped considerably due to restrictions. However, a slight recovery can be observed from 2021 onwards, reaching 859 million liters in sales during the year, and expected to increase to 100 million liters by 2026. Monster Beverage Corporation (NASDAQ:MNST) is a popular name in the Middle East, with the company boasting a 6.5% share in the regional market. Following the health-conscious approach of many countries – including in the Middle East – to reduce obesity, Monster Beverage Corporation (NASDAQ:MNST) announced the launch of Monster Energy Zero Sugar earlier this year. According to the company, Monster Beverage Corporation (NASDAQ:MNST)’s team of scientists have concocted what is 100% Monster and 0% sugar. Primed with 160 mg of caffeine – like its predecessor – Monster Energy Zero Sugar helps fight fatigue, and improve mental performance and focus. With that said, here are the Countries with the Highest Proportion of Non-Drinkers. 17 Countries with the Highest Percentage of Non-DrinkersPixabay/Public DomainMethodology:To collect data for this article, we have referred to the Global Health Observatory of the World Health Organization, looking for Countries with the Highest Percentage of Lifetime Alcohol Abstainers. Lifetime abstinence is defined as the proportion of adults (15+ years) in a given population who have not consumed any alcohol during their lifetime. If you also wish to read about countries with the highest rate of alcohol-use disorder, here are the 20 Countries with Highest Rates of Alcoholism. 17. ComorosPercentage of Non-Drinkers: 93.3%The Comoros is a volcanic archipelago off Africa’s east coast, in the warm Indian Ocean waters of the Mozambique channel. Although alcoholic beverages are available in certain parts of the country (notably the large Volo-Volo market in the national capital Moroni), the public consumption of alcohol is generally frowned upon in the islands, as over 95% of the country’s population are devout Sunni Muslims. Alcohol is also served in a few bars and restaurants though they tend to be expensive. 16. Saudi ArabiaPercentage of Non-Drinkers: 93.4%It should come as no surprise that alcohol is not exactly the most popular drink in the birthplace of Islam. Alcohol consumption, import, brewing, and selling is completely banned in Saudi Arabia. However, non-alcoholic beer, wine, and spirits are gaining traction in the Middle Eastern country, in part due to an increasingly well-traveled consumer base. Saudi Champagne – a mix of fruit and soda water that can easily be made at home – is a popular drink in the country. 15. AlgeriaPercentage of Non-Drinkers: 93.5%Due to strong conservative Islamic beliefs, alcoholic consumption is frowned upon throughout most of North Africa. Nevertheless, large exceptions are made for visiting tourists. If you wish to drink alcohol in Algeria, there are some options to drink in restaurants, bars, hotels, and private homes. However, it’s still illegal to drink publicly in the country. Beer is the most popular alcoholic beverage in Algeria, accounting for 57% of the recorded alcohol consumption. Algeria ranks among the countries with the highest rate of alcohol abstinence. 14. IraqPercentage of Non-Drinkers: 93.8%Iraqi attitudes towards alcohol have certainly had their ups and downs, from the relative ease of availability and acceptance in society in the mid-20th century to the Iraqi Parliament’s decision to outright ban the bottle in 2016. In February, the Iraqi government published the long-proposed legislation banning the import of alcoholic beverages into the country, no doubt including Saddam’s beloved Johnny Walker Black Label. 13. JordanPercentage of Non-Drinkers: 93.9%Although public displays of drunkenness are frowned upon, drinking alcohol in Jordan is accepted as long as it is done in moderation. Some restaurants will serve alcoholic beverages and there are a number of bars in Amman. Amstel – owned by Heineken N.V. – remains the most consumed beer in the country with a 90% Muslim population. 12. EgyptPercentage of Non-Drinkers: 94.3%As Egypt is a majority Muslim country, many locals abstain from alcohol completely. However, it is possible to find liquor stores and bars in some upmarket neighborhoods, and many hotels and resorts serve alcohol. Beer is the most popular beverage in the North African country, accounting for 54% of all alcohol consumption. Stella Lager – owned by Heineken N.V. since 2002 – is the most popular beer brand in Egypt. Egypt ranks 12th among countries with the highest percentage of non-drinkers. 11. Morocco Percentage of Non-Drinkers: 94.6%The general act of consuming alcohol is not illegal in Morocco and you can find all sorts of alcoholic beverages all over the country. They even produce their own beers, wines, and liquors. However, where and how you consume alcohol is what lawmakers and their enforcers care about. According to the ‘2021 Financial Law Implementation’ report, Morocco had collected a total of $86 million from import taxes on alcohol and wine, while the import taxes on beer accumulated $106 million for the national kitty. 10. SudanPercentage of Non-Drinkers: 95.2%For several decades, locally made alcoholic beverages and locally cultivated cannabis have been the two main substances of use among certain groups in Sudan. Alcohol, although it has been prohibited by Sharia laws since 1983, is still illicitly used in many parts of the country. However, in 2020, Sudan legalized the consumption of alcohol by non-Muslims, which make up 3% of the north African country’s total population. Sudan ranks among the top 10 countries with the highest percentage of people who don’t drink alcohol. 9. IranPercentage of Non-Drinkers: 96%Alcohol has been illegal for Muslim Iranian citizens since the establishment of the Islamic Republic government in 1979. Most consumers drink homemade alcoholic beverages in the country. However, the strong public demand benefits the illegal multibillion-dollar business of importing alcoholic beverages and facilitating their production inside Iran. 8. PakistanPercentage of Non-Drinkers: 96.5%Alcohol is largely prohibited for Muslims in Pakistan, but this doesn’t stop a black market from ensuring the supply of illicit liquor. Murree Brewery Company Limited – Pakistan’s largest and oldest producer of alcoholic products – is one of the most successful companies on the Pakistan Stock Exchange. Due to the social stigma it faces in the country, the brewery does not advertise and keeps a low profile. However, during the height of the pandemic, the company was able to somewhat improve its public image by producing 10,000 gallons of ethanol-based hand sanitizer. Pakistan ranks 8th in our list of countries with the highest percentage of non-drinkers.7. Solomon IslandsPercentage of Non-Drinkers: 97.1%In the Solomon Islands, illegal liquor known as Kwaso is distilled and widely consumed. It is often of low quality and is thought to have caused death, blindness, and several health problems. 6. SyriaPercentage of Non-Drinkers: 97.7%Alcohol is not banned in Syria as it is in some Muslim countries. Nor is it reserved for the upper class elite or religious minorities. Syria’s constitution uses Islamic jurisprudence as a primary source of law, but the Baathist regime has kept alcohol legal, available, and cheap.The Middle Eastern country has long produced its own alcoholic beverages, from beer to wine to the anise-based Arak. The leading brands in the Syrian beer market are Almaza, Heineken, and Al-Rayess. Syria ranks 6th among countries with the highest percentage of alcohol abstainers. Click to continue reading and see the 5 Countries with the Highest Percentage of Non-Drinkers. Suggested Articles:Vodka Consumption by Country: Top 20 Countries Top 20 Oldest Breweries in America20 Cities with the Most Bars per Capita in the WorldDisclosure: None. 17 Countries with the Highest Percentage of Non-Drinkers is originally published on Insider Monkey.]"

I don’t say this to cast aspersions on any market expert. Rather, it’s just a fact of life: people can’t be all things at all times.Still, this framework opens doors of opportunities for those interested in potentially robust stocks to buy. First, market ideas that fall far away from the spotlight generally don’t receive much analyst coverage and/or retail trading volume. However, should circumstances start turning favorably, the wave could rush in, thus handsomely rewarding those who initiated positions early.Second, under-the-radar stocks theoretically offer a higher margin of safety. For example, if a flavor of the week loses sentiment, the underlying security can tumble in a hurry. However, lesser-known ideas didn’t receive much fanfare anyways; thus, there might not be much to fall to.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsStill, going off the beaten path carries risks of business unpredictability, among other headwinds. If you can accept that, perhaps these stocks to buy should be on your watch list.Stocks to Buy: Cigna (CI)Cigna logo displayed on a modern smartphone. CI stock.Source: Piotr Swat / ShutterstockUnquestionably, healthcare services provider Cigna (NYSE:CI) represents an incredibly relevant enterprise. At the same time, many investors refuse to consider it one of the stocks to buy because it’s incredibly boring. Plus, it has become surprisingly volatile. Since the start of the year, the CI stock slipped almost 16%. Much of the pain came as Wall Street digested its mixed second-quarter earnings report.Still, the fallout in CI seems a bit overdone, making it one of the under-the-radar stocks. To be fair, Cigna’s three-year revenue growth rate (per-share basis) of 12.4% sits right on the median line of its industry. However, buyers would be getting a great deal for that top-line performance, with shares trading at only 0.44x trailing-year sales. In contrast, the sector median comes in at 0.68x.Story continuesJust as you might expect from a relevant enterprise, Cigna is consistently profitable, with a trailing-year net margin of 3.58% (above 68.42% of rivals). Nevertheless, the market prices CI at a forward multiple of 11.03x. As a discount to projected earnings, Cigna ranks better than 66.67% of the competition.Archer-Daniels-Midland (ADM)An image of a street sign post with directions labeled ""Buy"", ""Hold"", and ""Sell""Source: PX Media / ShutterstockIf we were speaking colloquially, I’d say that multinational food processing and commodities trading firm Archer-Daniels-Midland (NYSE:ADM) sells itself, with some choice colorful phrases thrown in there for good effect. At the end of the day, no matter how advanced we as humans get, we’ll still need nourishment to thrive. On that note, ADM effectively operates as a permanently relevant enterprise.Nevertheless, ADM incurred much choppiness throughout this year. Against the Jan. opener, shares find themselves down about 8%. Naturally, Russia’s invasion of Ukraine threw the global food supply chain for a loop, along with the sourcing of critical commodities. Still, food-related businesses should be long-term resilient just out of necessity.Financially, ADM is also quite intriguing. Right now, the company prints a three-year revenue growth rate of 16.4%, ranked better than 76.9% of its peers. Despite this, shares trade at only 0.46x sales, ranked favorably lower than 72.41% of companies listed in the consumer packaged goods industry. Thus, it’s one of the under-the-radar stocks to buy.Stocks to Buy: Titan Machinery (TITN)Man holding stacks of money. Unknown Millionaire-Maker cryptos. Strong Buy Stocks.Source: Epic Cure / ShutterstockAn incredibly risky bet, based on its chart performance – or lack thereof – Titan Machinery (NASDAQ:TITN) doesn’t get the attention it deserves. Still, I believe it’s still one of the top stocks to buy for contrarians willing to take the adventurous path. As one of the largest U.S.-based dealers of agricultural and construction equipment, Titan commands permanent relevance.With the growing domestic and global population, food resources have never been more critical. So, while Titan does have its issues – such as a cash-to-debt ratio that sits at a lowly 0.06x – the broader fundamentals should make up for it. However, Wall Street doesn’t see it that way yet. Since the start of this year, TITN fell more than 27%.However, Titan enjoys over the past three years a revenue and EBITDA growth rate of 18.4% and 46.2%, respectively. Both stats easily exceed their respective sector median stats. Yet TITN trades at only 5.87x trailing earnings without non-recurring items (NRI). As a discount to profitability, Titan ranks better than 83.46% of its peers.Weyerhaeuser (WY)Weyergaeuser logo on a smartphone with a keyboard in the background.Source: rafapress / ShutterstockAn American timberland company, Weyerhaeuser (NYSE:WY) owns nearly 12.4 million acres of timberlands in the U.S., per its public profile. In addition, it manages an additional 14 million acres of timberlands under long-term licenses in Canada. Plus, Weyerhaeuser features a long history of manufactured wood products. Frankly, it’s one of the top under-the-radar stocks to buy.Right now, one of the biggest problems facing the consumer economy is the lack of affordable housing. More than just an individual financial burden, denying first-time homebuyers access to real estate may impose a generational crisis. Basically, it would disrupt the cradle-to-grave lifecycle of any society. But what could ease this problem? Building out more homes, which could richly benefit WY.Not surprisingly, in my view, Weyerhaeuser features an impressive three-year revenue growth rate of 16%, beating out 90% of competitors. However, WY trades at only 2.98x sales, below the sector median of 6.31x. This bargain might not last for long.Stocks to Buy: Brookfield Reinsurance (BNRE)Source: ShutterstockIf you thought Cigna was boring as heck, check out Brookfield Reinsurance (NYSE:BNRE). A specialist in the namesake industry, reinsurance is “a way of transferring some of the financial risk that insurance companies assume when insuring cars, homes, people, and businesses to another company, the reinsurer,” according to Investopedia.Again, it sounds like a snooze-inducing concept. Here’s what you really need to know. According to Allied Market Research, the global reinsurance market reached a valuation of $498.7 billion in 2021. Further, experts project that by 2031, the segment will hit $1.34 trillion. This represents a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 10.8% from 2022 to 2031.To be fair, certain areas of Brookfield’s financials could use improvement. For example, its debt-to-equity ratio clocks in at 0.75x, unfavorably higher than the sector median of 0.25x. As well, its cash-to-debt ratio is only 0.85x. However, the company enjoys a net margin of 9.14%, beating out nearly 65% of its peers. Also, BNRE trades at only 3.73x operating cash flow, well beneath the sector median 7.92x.World Kinect (WKC)hands at desk near laptop computer, with one hand holding a pile of hundred dollar bills. Bank stocksSource: shutterstock.com/CC7An energy, commodities and services firm, World Kinect (NYSE:WKC) operates in the natural gas and power spheres, per its public profile. However, it primarily focuses on the marketing, trading, and financing of aviation, marine, building and ground transportation energy commodities and related services. Thanks to its wide relevance, WKC ranks among the under-the-radar stocks to buy.Unfortunately, WKC gets lost in the noise, with the market not appreciating the opportunity. To be sure, the company could use some improvements in its financials. For example, its cash balance relative to debt is rather modest, ranking worse than 60% of its peers. Still, the volatility impacting WKC – down over 17% since the Jan. opener and down nearly 23% in the past 365 days – seems a bit excessive.After all, World Kinect features a three-year revenue growth rate of 19.4%, above 69.71% of sector rivals. Even with that performance, WKC trades at only 0.03x sales, which is practically subterranean.

If you want to skip our detailed discussion about the healthcare industry, head directly to Ken Fisher’s Top 5 Healthcare Stock Picks.The healthcare sector was forever changed by the COVID-19 pandemic. While it highlighted the weaknesses in the global medical supply chains, the medical industry exhibited tremendous commitment and resilience in its pursuit to fight the global pandemic. This has since led to the need for sustainability and innovation throughout the industry. The global healthcare industry was effective in treating the pandemic with its mRNA vaccines. However, the demand for these vaccines has naturally declined since then. According to Precedence Research, the global biotech industry was valued at $1.2 trillion in 2022 and is expected to grow roughly 12% per annum over the next 7 years, reaching $3.2 trillion by 2030. While the healthcare industry foresees normalization this year to pre-pandemic levels, Deloitte expects the United States spending in the sector to increase up to $12 trillion by 2040. With the global focus on artificial intelligence, numerous biotech companies are exploring applications in workforce and patient management. Similarly, the technological advancements in medical equipment for minimally invasive procedures has a positive impact on patient recovery, through smaller incisions that are less damaging to muscle and tissue. BlackRock reported that it forecasts the minimally invasive market to be valued at $76 billion by 2027. Moreover, drug development also presents a promising future. With over 55 million Alzheimer’s patients, a new antibody treatment slowed the rate of cognitive decline by 27%. As these studies and clinical trials continue, the pharmaceutical industry is poised for more research, development, and innovation. Don't Miss: Billionaire Ken Fisher and Corporate Insiders Are Betting On These StocksWhile on the correct path, the industry still faces a number of challenges. According to Deloitte, the first major challenge has been the digital transformation in the healthcare sector. The pandemic presented an opportunity for low-cost and safe remote interactions. However, this also showcased the need for virtual health records and data management, through cloud-based solutions. In addition to electronic health records, the adoption of telemedicine can improve the organizational efficiency and cater to the labor shortages that the industry has lately experienced. Moreover, the global healthcare industry will need over 80 million additional workers by 2030. This has further stressed upon the need for ‘hospitals from home’. LBMC, a professional services CPA firm, reported that the global market for telehealth was valued in excess of $48 billion in 2022 and it is expected to grow over $57 billion in 2023. To supplement telehealth, there is a growing need for healthcare devices for remote monitoring, such as health bands. Story continuesAlso Read: Ken Fisher’s Top 15 Energy Stock PicksKen Fisher of Fisher Asset Management is one of the leading investment analysts in the world, with a net worth in excess of $6.8 billion. Last year, when the S&amp;P 500 was down by 18%, Fisher predicted the market would rise after the midterm elections. According to Fisher, since 1925, the fourth quarter for every time a midterm election has been held, the stock market has delivered positive results 83% of the time. For 2023, he expects the market to be led by “high quality mega-tech” stocks. Fisher explained that after the midterm election, investor confidence grows and the market is less risk-averse. He further explained that historically, the later half of the year, although less profitable than the first half of the year, continues to perform better than the normal market. While normally stocks rise 60%-70% of the time, in the midterm election year, stocks have reflected a 92% increase, historically. As inflation slowly declines and the US economy grows gradually, Fisher expects the market to remain positive, heading into 2024.In this article, we discuss some of Ken Fisher’s top stock picks in the healthcare sector including Merck &amp; Co., Inc. (NYSE:MRK), Intuitive Surgical, Inc. (NASDAQ:ISRG), and Eli Lilly and Company (NYSE:LLY).Our Methodology We used Fisher Asset Management’s Q2 2023 portfolio and selected the 15 biggest positions in healthcare firms during the quarter for this list.

Medtronic is the world’s largest device manufacturer, and it holds the number one or number two market share in most of its product segments. Medtronic’s business is heavily weighted towards complicated in-patient procedures, which are typically quite profitable. Industry dynamics are quite attractive with an aging global population and the growth of improved healthcare in emerging markets; furthermore, most of its segments are highly concentrated with just 2-3 players that split each segment’s market share, affording the key participants with significant economies of scale and pricing power. The Company has been recently addressing several temporary headwinds including a strong dollar, inflation, a delayed recovery in surgical volumes from the coronavirus pandemic, and supply chain issues.

Investors are concerned about legal liabilities associated with its antacid drug Zantac. While it is impossible to know the outcome with certainty, our preliminary assessment suggests that the decline in market capitalization exceeds the likely financial impact on the company.”13.

Two of our top five largest individual detractors for the period were in the health care sector: Sanofi (NASDAQ:SNY) and Bayer (OTCPK:BAYZF). Sanofi, a French pharmaceutical and health care company, saw its share price fall after it was named as a co-defendant in a class action lawsuit alleging that Sanofi and other sellers of the heartburn medication Zantac failed to warn of the drug’s risk of containing a possible carcinogen.”10.

Healthcare is generally less macro-sensitive than some other sectors. In a reversal of market sentiment compared to 2022, the healthcare sector has been under modest pressure due to what we consider to be some short-term transitory issues, while technology, particularly anything to do with AI, has become the market’s dish du jour. We have been selectively increasing our investment in a few very high-quality healthcare businesses at prices we consider to be fair. UnitedHealth Group Incorporated (NYSE:UNH) is now a top 10 holding, and our investment thesis is outlined in this report.We have previously written on our exposure to taxes through our investment in Intuit and its market leading TurboTax franchise (Intuit also owns the QuickBooks small business accounting franchise, Credit Karma and Mailchimp). UnitedHealth Group (UnitedHealth) is leading the charge to postpone the inevitable, while lowering overall healthcare system costs.U.S. health spending has outpaced GDP growth for decades, with spending on healthcare increasing from around 12% of GDP in the 1980s to nearly 20% today, driven by advancements in healthcare capabilities and an aging population with increased life expectancy…” (Click here to read the full text)9.

Shares fell after the company’s transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) business missed Street expectations again. Management attributed the sales shortfall to disruption from hospital staffing shortages, an issue that has an outsized impact on TAVR procedures because they are resource-intensive and require multiple specialists. We reduced the position due to increased uncertainty around the growth outlook.”8.

Danaher has underperformed the S&amp;P 500 this year due to a slowdown in the bioprocessing industry and more cautious spending by biopharma customers. Bioprocessing is a key end-market that drives more than a quarter of Danaher’s profits. Bioprocessing products are the main inputs that biopharma companies use to manufacture biologic drugs, which are the fastest growing category of drugs, growing low-to-mid-teens and representing a sizable portion of the clinical pipeline.The bioprocessing industry experienced significant growth in 2021 and 2022, driven by Covid vaccines and a strong biotech funding environment. Several participants, including Danaher, lowered their 2023 growth outlook in large part due to customer inventory destocking and biotech funding weakness. We anticipate that this slowdown is temporary, and the bioprocessing industry will return to normalized growth of high-single digit to mid-teens in 2024 and beyond.…” (Click here to read the full text)7. Abbott Laboratories (NYSE:ABT)Fisher Asset Management's Stake Value: $1,054,115,000Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 62Abbott Laboratories (NYSE:ABT) is one of the leading pharmaceutical companies in the world. It is engaged in four segments – Established Pharmaceutical Products, Diagnostic Products, Nutritional Products, and Medical Devices. On July 20, Abbott Laboratories (NYSE:ABT) reported a Q2 revenue of $10 billion, along with a non-GAAP EPS of $1.08, surpassing Wall Street estimates by $280 million and $0.03, respectively. At the end of Q2 2023, Fisher Asset Management held 9.6 million shares of Abbott Laboratories (NYSE:ABT) worth $1.05 billion.According to Insider Monkey’s second quarter database, 62 hedge funds were bullish on Abbott Laboratories (NYSE:ABT), as opposed to 70 funds in the last quarter. Ric Dillon’s Diamond Hill Capital held a notable position in the company, with 5.1 million shares worth $553.4 million. Polen Global Growth Strategy said this about Abbott Laboratories (NYSE:ABT) in its Q1 2023 investor letter:“As stated below in the portfolio activity section, Abbott Laboratories (NYSE:ABT) is expected to see roughly $6 billion in COVID test sales evaporate this year, creating a headwind for margins and underlying earnings per share. As long-term owners of the business, these test sales were never part of our original investment case. The core business, our primary focus, has a clear path of growing high single digits in 2023 with durable growth beyond, in our view. We believe the current price of 23x NTM P/E , while reasonable, is also misleading considering earnings this year will be artificially depressed because of the drop in COVID testing sales. On normalized earnings, the price is lower. We anticipate underlying EPS growth of at least low-teens over the next three to five years.Lastly, we trimmed Abbott Laboratories, bringing it back to a more average position size and to also fund our increase in Thermo Fisher. Abbott is entering a year in which the company is expected to see approximately $6bn in COVID-19 test sales disappear, thus creating a headwind for margins and EPS. That said, the core business has a clear path to growing high single digits in FY23. EPS grew at a 20% CAGR from 2019-2022, far beyond our expectations when we initiated our investment. Now, we expect a more normal growth rate of low teens EPS beyond this year. Further, management’s adeptness at allocating capital continues to impress us. We expect Abbott to drive top line growth without heavily investing in R&amp;D and SG&amp;A this year — management effectively “front-loaded” those investments in 2021 and 2022 when COVID test sales created a bolus of cash. We believe this should allow for leverage on the operating margin going forward. Combined, Abbott and Thermo Fisher now represent 7% of the Portfolio.”6. Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ)Fisher Asset Management's Stake Value: $1,103,610,000Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 88Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) specializes in the manufacture of healthcare products in the consumer health segment.

Instead, it's adopting a more forward-looking strategy towards real estate assets. Real estate experts exude a sense of careful optimism. Their strategy involves riding the existing slump while strategically preparing their companies for a future phase of consistent expansion and favorable financial outcomes. Valued at approximately $2.53 billion in 2023, the residential real estate market in the United States is projected to reach nearly $2.80 billion by 2028, as reported by Mordor Intelligence. This indicates a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of around 2.04% throughout the forecast period from 2023 to 2028. The prevailing trend of inflation in the country has deeply influenced businesses. Elevated inflation rates have prompted individuals to allocate more funds towards essential needs like sustenance and attire, concurrently impacting the real estate sector focused on home ownership. Since the COVID-19 pandemic, a multitude of buyers have capitalized on the favorable low interest rates to modify their home loans, move to new locations, or buy their first homes. As a result, there was a notable surge in home sales during the latter part of 2020, and this heightened level has persisted beyond the pre-pandemic period. Prior to the pandemic's onset, home values had been ascending, but with a remarkable surge in demand in 2020, the Freddie Mac House Price Index registered a staggering 11.3% escalation. Additionally, during the final quarter of 2021, a surplus of 142,406 housing units were accessible to address consumer needs, with more than 89% of these units being occupied by homeowners and renters. Moreover, the majority of transactions within this domain stem from citizens categorized as middle-aged and elderly. For example, individuals aged between 45 and 65 years represented over 70% of the country's homeownership rates throughout the four quarters of 2021. A substantial portion of the demand within this sector is fueled by condominiums and apartments. Apartments are projected to dominate this landscape compared to condominiums, as evidenced by the completion of 64,000 apartment units during the second quarter of 2021.Story continuesDon't Miss: 11 Most Undervalued REIT Stocks to Buy On the other hand, as per a separate report by Mordor Intelligence, the self-storage market in the United States is projected to increase from $43.34 billion in 2023 to approximately $48.73 billion by 2028, reflecting a CAGR of 2.37% within the forecast period. Owing to swift urbanization in the United States, the demand for self-storage facilities is on the rise. In 2020, as much as 82.66% of the population resided in urban regions, and projections indicate a surge to 89.16% by 2050. Consequently, the necessity for storage options is becoming increasingly urgent. Self-storage providers are capitalizing on this trend by constructing facilities in densely inhabited zones. This demand stems from multiple influences, including the prevalence of compact living spaces in heavily populated areas and individuals opting to move to smaller residences. Favorable economic momentum, including faster job establishment, elevated levels of confidence, and an increase in the number of households, is bolstering the self-storage industry.

The stock had lagged because of two issues: first, frozen food manufacturers and their customers had labor issues that restricted production and thus the need for storage; and second, the company had execution issues. It seems like industry trends are improving. Plus, the company is making progress increasing its productivity and improving margins, somewhat from the effect of hiring some new senior executives.The stability of the business and the fact that it pays a nice dividend as a REIT is a positive in this market. Even after its recent pickup, we think the stock still trades at a modest cap rate and well below its private market value, so the stock can work via growth and multiple expansion.”10.

93,2228e3bc-408e-3c22-8ccf-75ea27f5207e,PEP,2023-08-27,17 Countries with the Highest Percentage of Non-Drinkers,Insider Monkey,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/17-countries-highest-percentage-non-162210637.html,1693066930,STORY,"['BUD', 'MNST', 'KO', 'PEP']","[In this article, we are going to discuss the 17 countries with the highest percentage of non-drinkers. You can skip our detailed analysis of the global alcohol industry, and the opportunities for non-alcoholic beverages in countries with a low prevalence of alcohol, and go directly to 5 Countries with the Highest Percentage of Non-Drinkers. Globally, an estimated 35% of men are non-drinkers, while the rate for women is 55%. Alcohol has been outlawed in several countries today, in part or as a whole. All of these countries have a majority Muslim population and have governments that adhere to some form of Islamic law, known as Sharia. In the Islamic religion, two of the most significant prohibitions are eating pork and drinking alcohol. There are about 14 countries that have outlawed alcohol to some degree. The Global Alcohol Industry:In 2019, the global alcohol consumption, measured in liters of pure alcohol per person of 15 years of age or older, was 5.5 liters, which is a 4.7% relative decrease from 5.7 liters in 2010. As we mentioned in our article – Top 20 Alcohol Drinking Countries in the World – the global alcoholic beverages market size was valued at $1.62 trillion in 2021, and the market is projected to reach $2 trillion by 2031, with a CAGR of 2.2% in the forecast period concluding in 2031.Opportunities for Non-Alcoholic Beverages: The low prevalence of alcohol in several Muslim-majority countries leads people to look elsewhere to quench their thirst, presenting opportunities to other non-alcoholic drinks. While the low- and no-alcohol trend is taking off in the Western world, another region which holds opportunities for this sector is the Middle East, where alcohol is banned in many countries. In 2019, Saudi Arabia was recorded to have the sixth-largest global market for alcohol-free beer consumption. Several booze companies have hopped on the zero-alcohol bandwagon, and are now offering products with all of the taste and none of the booze. Budweiser Zero was launched in 2020 by Anheuser-Busch InBev SA/NV (NYSE:BUD) as the company’s first non-alcoholic beer, setting itself up as the industry standard. Anheuser-Busch InBev SA/NV (NYSE:BUD) also reportedly bought the rights to supply the FIFA World Cup for $75 million exclusively last year. Story continuesAs the sale of alcohol is strictly controlled in Qatar, Bud Zero ended up being the only brew available at the stadiums during the whole event. Last month, Anheuser-Busch InBev SA/NV (NYSE:BUD) announced plans to invest $34 million in its Belgian breweries to help expand its portfolio of non-alcoholic beers, improve bottling capacity, and optimize a new non-alcoholic system used to make Corona Cero. Anheuser-Busch InBev SA/NV (NYSE:BUD) is the Largest Beer Producer in the World but the company is facing some headwinds in the American market after the recent controversy regarding its best-selling brand Bud Light, which resulted in the iconic brand losing its crown as the Top-Selling Beer in America. Although, as we mentioned in our article – 20 Countries that Drink the Most Beer per Capita – billionaire Bill Gates’ portfolio managers decided to initiate a $96 million position in the firm during the second quarter. Broyhill Asset Management said the following about Anheuser-Busch InBev SA/NV (NYSE:BUD) in its second quarter 2023 investor letter:“The largest detractors to performance over the quarter were First Horizon Corp (FHN), Anheuser-Busch InBev SA/NV (NYSE:BUD), and Bayer (BAYRY). Problems at Anheuser Busch InBev began on April 1 with Dylan Mulvaney’s social media post, which ignited a fiery backlash amongst Bud Light customers across ‘Merica. With volumes down sharply, and competitors gaining share at BUD’s expense, operational deleveraging is set to weigh heavily on US margins amid peak demand pressure in the second quarter. Despite severe US headwinds (second-quarter operating profit maybe half of last year’s levels), we still expect BUD to grow consolidated operating profit at a mid-single-digit rate for the full year. With current issues well understood and investor sentiment in the gutters, we see significant upside in a stock, which is approaching a double-digit FCF yield. With FX headwinds and rising input costs reversing course, increasing margins are likely to drive positive surprises into FY24 as continued deleveraging accrues more value to shareholders.”Saudi Arabia also leads the Middle Eastern market in terms of its consumption of drinks from the The Coca Cola Company (NYSE:KO), with Palestine not far behind. The Coca Cola Company (NYSE:KO)'s dominance in the Saudi Market is also due, in part, to the company's focus on product innovation and customer-oriented marketing. Over the past few years, the company has been investing heavily in new packaging that allows customers to customize their drinks to their taste preferences. The Coca Cola Company (NYSE:KO) now represents nearly 40% of all carbonated soft drink sales in the Middle East.Sales of PepsiCo, Inc. (NASDAQ:PEP) have traditionally been stronger in the Middle East, due, in part, to an Arab league-imposed boycott on Coca-Cola, which began when the firm decided in 1968 to open a bottling plant in Israel. PepsiCo, Inc. (NASDAQ:PEP) has been focusing on innovation and sustainability in its operations in the region – the company introduced the 'Dawah' bottle in the Middle East to recycle 88% of the water used in its production process. PepsiCo, Inc. (NASDAQ:PEP) also introduced a new beverage package in the Saudi market that is easier to use, recyclable, and doesn't require any water to consume. Similarly, the energy drinks market in the Middle East is one of the most promising in the coming years. It is true that during the pandemic, sales volumes dropped considerably due to restrictions. However, a slight recovery can be observed from 2021 onwards, reaching 859 million liters in sales during the year, and expected to increase to 100 million liters by 2026. Monster Beverage Corporation (NASDAQ:MNST) is a popular name in the Middle East, with the company boasting a 6.5% share in the regional market. Following the health-conscious approach of many countries – including in the Middle East – to reduce obesity, Monster Beverage Corporation (NASDAQ:MNST) announced the launch of Monster Energy Zero Sugar earlier this year. According to the company, Monster Beverage Corporation (NASDAQ:MNST)’s team of scientists have concocted what is 100% Monster and 0% sugar. Primed with 160 mg of caffeine – like its predecessor – Monster Energy Zero Sugar helps fight fatigue, and improve mental performance and focus. With that said, here are the Countries with the Highest Proportion of Non-Drinkers. 17 Countries with the Highest Percentage of Non-DrinkersPixabay/Public DomainMethodology:To collect data for this article, we have referred to the Global Health Observatory of the World Health Organization, looking for Countries with the Highest Percentage of Lifetime Alcohol Abstainers. Lifetime abstinence is defined as the proportion of adults (15+ years) in a given population who have not consumed any alcohol during their lifetime. If you also wish to read about countries with the highest rate of alcohol-use disorder, here are the 20 Countries with Highest Rates of Alcoholism. 17. ComorosPercentage of Non-Drinkers: 93.3%The Comoros is a volcanic archipelago off Africa’s east coast, in the warm Indian Ocean waters of the Mozambique channel. Although alcoholic beverages are available in certain parts of the country (notably the large Volo-Volo market in the national capital Moroni), the public consumption of alcohol is generally frowned upon in the islands, as over 95% of the country’s population are devout Sunni Muslims. Alcohol is also served in a few bars and restaurants though they tend to be expensive. 16. Saudi ArabiaPercentage of Non-Drinkers: 93.4%It should come as no surprise that alcohol is not exactly the most popular drink in the birthplace of Islam. Alcohol consumption, import, brewing, and selling is completely banned in Saudi Arabia. However, non-alcoholic beer, wine, and spirits are gaining traction in the Middle Eastern country, in part due to an increasingly well-traveled consumer base. Saudi Champagne – a mix of fruit and soda water that can easily be made at home – is a popular drink in the country. 15. AlgeriaPercentage of Non-Drinkers: 93.5%Due to strong conservative Islamic beliefs, alcoholic consumption is frowned upon throughout most of North Africa. Nevertheless, large exceptions are made for visiting tourists. If you wish to drink alcohol in Algeria, there are some options to drink in restaurants, bars, hotels, and private homes. However, it’s still illegal to drink publicly in the country. Beer is the most popular alcoholic beverage in Algeria, accounting for 57% of the recorded alcohol consumption. Algeria ranks among the countries with the highest rate of alcohol abstinence. 14. IraqPercentage of Non-Drinkers: 93.8%Iraqi attitudes towards alcohol have certainly had their ups and downs, from the relative ease of availability and acceptance in society in the mid-20th century to the Iraqi Parliament’s decision to outright ban the bottle in 2016. In February, the Iraqi government published the long-proposed legislation banning the import of alcoholic beverages into the country, no doubt including Saddam’s beloved Johnny Walker Black Label. 13. JordanPercentage of Non-Drinkers: 93.9%Although public displays of drunkenness are frowned upon, drinking alcohol in Jordan is accepted as long as it is done in moderation. Some restaurants will serve alcoholic beverages and there are a number of bars in Amman. Amstel – owned by Heineken N.V. – remains the most consumed beer in the country with a 90% Muslim population. 12. EgyptPercentage of Non-Drinkers: 94.3%As Egypt is a majority Muslim country, many locals abstain from alcohol completely. However, it is possible to find liquor stores and bars in some upmarket neighborhoods, and many hotels and resorts serve alcohol. Beer is the most popular beverage in the North African country, accounting for 54% of all alcohol consumption. Stella Lager – owned by Heineken N.V. since 2002 – is the most popular beer brand in Egypt. Egypt ranks 12th among countries with the highest percentage of non-drinkers. 11. Morocco Percentage of Non-Drinkers: 94.6%The general act of consuming alcohol is not illegal in Morocco and you can find all sorts of alcoholic beverages all over the country. They even produce their own beers, wines, and liquors. However, where and how you consume alcohol is what lawmakers and their enforcers care about. According to the ‘2021 Financial Law Implementation’ report, Morocco had collected a total of $86 million from import taxes on alcohol and wine, while the import taxes on beer accumulated $106 million for the national kitty. 10. SudanPercentage of Non-Drinkers: 95.2%For several decades, locally made alcoholic beverages and locally cultivated cannabis have been the two main substances of use among certain groups in Sudan. Alcohol, although it has been prohibited by Sharia laws since 1983, is still illicitly used in many parts of the country. However, in 2020, Sudan legalized the consumption of alcohol by non-Muslims, which make up 3% of the north African country’s total population. Sudan ranks among the top 10 countries with the highest percentage of people who don’t drink alcohol. 9. IranPercentage of Non-Drinkers: 96%Alcohol has been illegal for Muslim Iranian citizens since the establishment of the Islamic Republic government in 1979. Most consumers drink homemade alcoholic beverages in the country. However, the strong public demand benefits the illegal multibillion-dollar business of importing alcoholic beverages and facilitating their production inside Iran. 8. PakistanPercentage of Non-Drinkers: 96.5%Alcohol is largely prohibited for Muslims in Pakistan, but this doesn’t stop a black market from ensuring the supply of illicit liquor. Murree Brewery Company Limited – Pakistan’s largest and oldest producer of alcoholic products – is one of the most successful companies on the Pakistan Stock Exchange. Due to the social stigma it faces in the country, the brewery does not advertise and keeps a low profile. However, during the height of the pandemic, the company was able to somewhat improve its public image by producing 10,000 gallons of ethanol-based hand sanitizer. Pakistan ranks 8th in our list of countries with the highest percentage of non-drinkers.7. Solomon IslandsPercentage of Non-Drinkers: 97.1%In the Solomon Islands, illegal liquor known as Kwaso is distilled and widely consumed. It is often of low quality and is thought to have caused death, blindness, and several health problems. 6. SyriaPercentage of Non-Drinkers: 97.7%Alcohol is not banned in Syria as it is in some Muslim countries. Nor is it reserved for the upper class elite or religious minorities. Syria’s constitution uses Islamic jurisprudence as a primary source of law, but the Baathist regime has kept alcohol legal, available, and cheap.The Middle Eastern country has long produced its own alcoholic beverages, from beer to wine to the anise-based Arak. The leading brands in the Syrian beer market are Almaza, Heineken, and Al-Rayess. Syria ranks 6th among countries with the highest percentage of alcohol abstainers. Click to continue reading and see the 5 Countries with the Highest Percentage of Non-Drinkers. Suggested Articles:Vodka Consumption by Country: Top 20 Countries Top 20 Oldest Breweries in America20 Cities with the Most Bars per Capita in the WorldDisclosure: None. 17 Countries with the Highest Percentage of Non-Drinkers is originally published on Insider Monkey.]"
94,0370efc8-f05b-3e96-ad3d-70b3b6b9c5fb,REGN,2023-08-27,Regeneron Pharmaceuticals (NASDAQ:REGN) Seems To Use Debt Quite Sensibly,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/regeneron-pharmaceuticals-nasdaq-regn-seems-120025759.html,1693137625,STORY,"['REGN', 'BRK-A']","[The external fund manager backed by Berkshire Hathaway's Charlie Munger, Li Lu, makes no bones about it when he says 'The biggest investment risk is not the volatility of prices, but whether you will suffer a permanent loss of capital.' It's only natural to consider a company's balance sheet when you examine how risky it is, since debt is often involved when a business collapses. We can see that Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (NASDAQ:REGN) does use debt in its business. But the more important question is: how much risk is that debt creating?When Is Debt A Problem?Debt and other liabilities become risky for a business when it cannot easily fulfill those obligations, either with free cash flow or by raising capital at an attractive price. If things get really bad, the lenders can take control of the business. However, a more frequent (but still costly) occurrence is where a company must issue shares at bargain-basement prices, permanently diluting shareholders, just to shore up its balance sheet. Of course, plenty of companies use debt to fund growth, without any negative consequences. When we think about a company's use of debt, we first look at cash and debt together. Check out our latest analysis for Regeneron Pharmaceuticals What Is Regeneron Pharmaceuticals's Net Debt?The chart below, which you can click on for greater detail, shows that Regeneron Pharmaceuticals had US$1.98b in debt in June 2023; about the same as the year before. But on the other hand it also has US$8.93b in cash, leading to a US$6.95b net cash position.debt-equity-history-analysisA Look At Regeneron Pharmaceuticals' LiabilitiesAccording to the last reported balance sheet, Regeneron Pharmaceuticals had liabilities of US$3.10b due within 12 months, and liabilities of US$3.54b due beyond 12 months. Offsetting this, it had US$8.93b in cash and US$5.12b in receivables that were due within 12 months. So it can boast US$7.41b more liquid assets than total liabilities.Story continuesThis surplus suggests that Regeneron Pharmaceuticals has a conservative balance sheet, and could probably eliminate its debt without much difficulty. Succinctly put, Regeneron Pharmaceuticals boasts net cash, so it's fair to say it does not have a heavy debt load!In fact Regeneron Pharmaceuticals's saving grace is its low debt levels, because its EBIT has tanked 38% in the last twelve months. When it comes to paying off debt, falling earnings are no more useful than sugary sodas are for your health. When analysing debt levels, the balance sheet is the obvious place to start. But it is future earnings, more than anything, that will determine Regeneron Pharmaceuticals's ability to maintain a healthy balance sheet going forward. So if you want to see what the professionals think, you might find this free report on analyst profit forecasts to be interesting.Finally, a business needs free cash flow to pay off debt; accounting profits just don't cut it. Regeneron Pharmaceuticals may have net cash on the balance sheet, but it is still interesting to look at how well the business converts its earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) to free cash flow, because that will influence both its need for, and its capacity to manage debt. Over the most recent three years, Regeneron Pharmaceuticals recorded free cash flow worth 69% of its EBIT, which is around normal, given free cash flow excludes interest and tax. This cold hard cash means it can reduce its debt when it wants to.Summing UpWhile it is always sensible to investigate a company's debt, in this case Regeneron Pharmaceuticals has US$6.95b in net cash and a decent-looking balance sheet. And it impressed us with free cash flow of US$3.0b, being 69% of its EBIT. So we don't have any problem with Regeneron Pharmaceuticals's use of debt. Above most other metrics, we think its important to track how fast earnings per share is growing, if at all. If you've also come to that realization, you're in luck, because today you can view this interactive graph of Regeneron Pharmaceuticals's earnings per share history for free.If, after all that, you're more interested in a fast growing company with a rock-solid balance sheet, then check out our list of net cash growth stocks without delay.Have feedback on this article?
