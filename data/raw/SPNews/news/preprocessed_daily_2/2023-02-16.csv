The award recognizes organizations, products and people that are bringing new ideas to life in innovative ways.Respond MAP, which helps users analyze the impact of severe weather, was selected after its impactful contribution to the insurance industry during Hurricane Ian preparation and recovery efforts. When Hurricane Ian approached the Florida coastline, Verisk offered insurers the ability to track the storm and monitor potential impacts to their books of business with Respond Hurricane forecast footprints with the mapping and analytics platform. After landfall, this powerful blend of technology helped insurers to quickly identify damage, connect with policyholders impacted by the storm – many of whom had evacuated – and triage claims in the wake of this devastating event.“Critical times like this show the impact this technology can have in helping policyholders recover from a loss,” said Aaron Brunko, president of Property Estimating Solutions at Verisk. “It’s incredibly gratifying to see the difference our team can make during a time of need, and this recognition fuels our efforts to support resilience through data, technology and innovation.”Respond MAP combines Verisk’s valuable weather data with locations of interest, such as insurance policies-in-force and claims, to quickly evaluate the impact of significant weather events. The interactive platform delivers a geospatial weather command center to monitor potentially damaging weather events like hurricanes, severe thunderstorms, wildfires and more. It also connects insurers with pre- and post-event imagery and damage assessment analytics that leverage artificial intelligence, remote sensing technology and Verisk’s robust property and claims data to help identify affected properties, assess the extent of damage and triage on-site inspections.Story continuesOrganizations from across the globe submitted their recent innovations for consideration in the BIG Innovation Awards. Nominations were then judged by a select group of business leaders and executives who volunteer their time and expertise to score submissions.“Innovation is ‘business critical’ in today’s society,” said Maria Jimenez, chief operating officer of the Business Intelligence Group. “We are thrilled to be honoring Verisk as they are leading by example and improving the lives of so many.”Respond MAP is part of a wide range of solutions that Verisk offers to help insurers address catastrophe risks.

1,64b901ef-8280-3fdf-a2c8-784c1f298582,SCHW,2023-02-16,Is Schwab S&P 500 Index (SWPPX) a Strong Mutual Fund Pick Right Now?,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/schwab-p-500-index-swppx-120012645.html,1676548812,STORY,"['^GSPC', 'SCHW']","[If you've been stuck searching for Mutual Fund Equity Report funds, consider Schwab S&amp;P 500 Index (SWPPX) as a possibility. SWPPX has no Zacks Mutual Fund Rank, but we have been able to look into other metrics like performance, volatility, and cost.History of Fund/ManagerSchwab Funds is based in San Francisco, CA, and is the manager of SWPPX. Schwab S&amp;P 500 Index made its debut in May of 1997, and since then, SWPPX has accumulated about $61.07 billion in assets, per the most up-to-date date available. The fund's current manager is a team of investment professionals.PerformanceOf course, investors look for strong performance in funds. This fund has delivered a 5-year annualized total return of 9.52%, and is in the top third among its category peers. Investors who prefer analyzing shorter time frames should look at its 3-year annualized total return of 9.86%, which places it in the top third during this time-frame.When looking at a fund's performance, it is also important to note the standard deviation of the returns. The lower the standard deviation, the less volatility the fund experiences. Over the past three years, SWPPX's standard deviation comes in at 21.42%, compared to the category average of 21.25%. Over the past 5 years, the standard deviation of the fund is 18.74% compared to the category average of 18.85%. This makes the fund less volatile than its peers over the past half-decade.Risk FactorsInvestors should note that the fund has a 5-year beta of 1, which means it is hypothetically as volatile as the market at large. Another factor to consider is alpha, as it reflects a portfolio's performance on a risk-adjusted basis relative to a benchmark-in this case, the S&amp;P 500. With a positive alpha of 0.01, managers in this portfolio are skilled in picking securities that generate better-than-benchmark returns.HoldingsExamining the equity holdings of a mutual fund is also a valuable exercise. This can show us how the manager is applying their stated methodology, as well as if there are any inherent biases in their approach. For this particular fund, the focus is largely on equities that are traded in the United States.Story continuesCurrently, this mutual fund is holding 99% stock in stocks, with an average market capitalization of $248.30 billion. The fund has the heaviest exposure to the following market sectors:TechnologyFinanceRetail TradeWith turnover at about 2%, this fund makes fewer trades than its comparable peers.ExpensesFor investors, taking a closer look at cost-related metrics is key, since costs are increasingly important for mutual fund investing. Competition is heating up in this space, and a lower cost product will likely outperform its otherwise identical counterpart, all things being equal. In terms of fees, SWPPX is a no load fund. It has an expense ratio of 0.02% compared to the category average of 0.78%. SWPPX is actually cheaper than its peers when you consider factors like cost.Investors need to be aware that with this product, the minimum initial investment is $0; each subsequent investment has no minimum amount.Bottom LineDon't stop here for your research on Mutual Fund Equity Report funds.

But the reality is that when a company loses money each year, for long enough, its investors will usually take their share of those losses. While a well funded company may sustain losses for years, it will need to generate a profit eventually, or else investors will move on and the company will wither away.If this kind of company isn't your style, you like companies that generate revenue, and even earn profits, then you may well be interested in Charles Schwab (NYSE:SCHW). Even if this company is fairly valued by the market, investors would agree that generating consistent profits will continue to provide Charles Schwab with the means to add long-term value to shareholders. See our latest analysis for Charles Schwab How Quickly Is Charles Schwab Increasing Earnings Per Share?The market is a voting machine in the short term, but a weighing machine in the long term, so you'd expect share price to follow earnings per share (EPS) outcomes eventually. That makes EPS growth an attractive quality for any company. We can see that in the last three years Charles Schwab grew its EPS by 9.7% per year. That growth rate is fairly good, assuming the company can keep it up.Top-line growth is a great indicator that growth is sustainable, and combined with a high earnings before interest and taxation (EBIT) margin, it's a great way for a company to maintain a competitive advantage in the market. Not all of Charles Schwab's revenue this year is revenue from operations, so keep in mind the revenue and margin numbers used in this article might not be the best representation of the underlying business. Charles Schwab maintained stable EBIT margins over the last year, all while growing revenue 12% to US$21b. That's a real positive.The chart below shows how the company's bottom and top lines have progressed over time.

While crystal balls don't exist, you can check our visualization of consensus analyst forecasts for Charles Schwab's future EPS 100% free.Are Charles Schwab Insiders Aligned With All Shareholders?Since Charles Schwab has a market capitalisation of US$150b, we wouldn't expect insiders to hold a large percentage of shares. But we do take comfort from the fact that they are investors in the company. We note that their impressive stake in the company is worth US$9.0b. Investors will appreciate management having this amount of skin in the game as it shows their commitment to the company's future.Does Charles Schwab Deserve A Spot On Your Watchlist?One important encouraging feature of Charles Schwab is that it is growing profits. For those who are looking for a little more than this, the high level of insider ownership enhances our enthusiasm for this growth. The combination definitely favoured by investors so consider keeping the company on a watchlist.

Though U.S. stocks are showering strong gains to investors, the international market is not behind.This is especially true as Vanguard FTSE All-World ex-US ETF VEU targeting the international equity market has gained about 8.3% over the past three months compared with growth of 5.6% for iShares MSCI ACWI ETF ACWI, which targets the global stock market, including the United States.The solid trend is likely to continue and investors could tap this opportune moment with some popular international ETFs. These include Vanguard Total International Stock ETF VXUS, Vanguard FTSE All-World ex-US ETF VEU, SPDR Portfolio Developed World ex-US ETF SPDW, iShares Core MSCI International Developed Markets ETF IDEV, and Schwab Fundamental International Large Company Index ETF FNDF. The funds have a Zacks ETF Rank #3 (Hold).The outperformance came on the back of easing concerns about international economies. Europe has experienced a warmer-than-expected winter that helped the region avoid a feared energy crisis. Additionally, the reopening of China after the restrictions eased has not only infused optimism in the world’s second-largest economy but will power the economies across the globe (read: Winning Europe ETFs to Start 2023).A weaker dollar helped to boost returns for foreign stocks. The U.S. dollar against a basket of currencies has declined in recent months and is likely to be under pressure on Fed actions. The latest comment from Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell that inflation has started easing has spurred bets that the central bank could continue slowing its interest rate hike campaign.At the latest meeting early this month, the Fed lifted its benchmark interest rate by 0.25 percentage points to 4.5-4.75% and signaled that it could be closer to pausing its rate hike plan. This will attract more foreign inflows, raising the appeal for international equities (read: Fed Hike Slows Down But Set to Remain Steady: ETFs to Gain).Further, international stocks have become most attractively valued after years of underperformance. For most of last year, investors shunned these stocks on risks from Russia’s war with Ukraine, a potential energy crisis in Europe, turmoil in the U.K. bond market, China’s zero-Covid policy, regulatory pressure from Beijing and weakness in foreign currencies.Vanguard Total International Stock ETF (VXUS)Vanguard Total International Stock ETF offers exposure to companies located in developed and emerging markets, excluding the United States.

9,85a21bda-ab0a-33b9-bfbe-8fd93b3ceaec,RRC,2023-02-16,12 Most Profitable Natural Gas Stocks To Buy,Insider Monkey,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/12-most-profitable-natural-gas-225605888.html,1676501765,STORY,"['NG=F', 'BIREF', 'SWN', 'EQT', 'PEYUF', 'RRC', 'CRK']","[In this piece, we will take a look at the 12 most profitable natural gas stocks. For more gas stocks, head on over to 5 Most Profitable Natural Gas Stocks. Natural gas is turning out to be one of the more popular petroleum fuels in the world right now. This is because when compared to gasoline, diesel, or kerosene, natural gas produces far less carbon dioxide and few other pollutants such as sulfur dioxide. This is part of the reason why the U.S. - one of the world's largest energy consumers - has shifted its energy production to natural gas in a bid to reduce carbon dioxide emissions while still exploiting the massive energy generation potential of petroleum products. In fact, data from the Energy Information Administration (EIA) shows that natural gas was the second most widely fuel in the U.S., accounting for 32% of the energy consumption in 2021. While petroleum was still the largest, it was used mostly for transportation purposes, as natural gas was the dominant fuel of choice in residential, industrial, and commercial use cases. Within the electricity sector, natural gas also led the pack and accounted for 32% of the total usage, and overall, natural gas accounted for 36% of the U.S. primary energy production. Finally, U.S. natural gas production also outstripped usage in 2021.The dominance of America in the global natural gas supply chain also grew in 2022 in the aftermath of the Russian invasion of Ukraine. Europe, which had come to rely on Russian natural gas was in for a rough time as the Ukraine invasion saw its energy supplies disrupted and highlighted the need to drift away from Russian energy. This became a difficult task since Russia was the world's second largest natural gas producer in 2021, according to data from the BP Statistical Review. However, some progress is being made in this area, with the European Union having earmarked 210 billion euros to completely wean itself off of Russian fuels by 2030.Story continuesThis plan requires shifting away to non-Russian sources, saving energy, and spending more on renewable energy sources at the same time.

Here are two top-rated basic materials stocks investors should consider buying right now.CalMaine Foods (CALM) Still worthy of consideration is fresh shell egg producer Cal-Maine Foods which currently sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). Cal-Maine Foods Agriculture-Products Industry is also in the top 19% of over 250 Zacks Industries.Furthermore, CALM stock also lands an overall “A” VGM Style Scores grade. The price of eggs has risen to historical levels in the last few months and Cal-Maine Foods should be able to capitalize as the largest producer of fresh shell eggs in the United States.To that note, earnings estimate revisions have continued to soar for Cal-Maine Foods over the last quarter. Fiscal 2023 earnings estimates have skyrocketed 107% to $16.75 per share compared to estimates of $8.10 a share 90 days ago. Even better, Fiscal 2024 earnings estimates have climbed 74%.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchPlus, Call-Maine Foods stock is now up +33% over the last year to largely outperform the S&amp;P 500’s -9% and the Agriculture-Products Markets -10%. More Impressive, over the last three years, CALM’s +50% also tops the benchmark and roughly matches its Zacks Subindustry’s stellar performance.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchCommercial Metals (CMC)Another basic materials stock that may be beneficial in investors’ portfolios is Commercial Metals. There is an abundance of Steel-Producers stocks to choose from with the industry currently in the top 16% of all Zacks Industries but CMC sticks out sporting a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).Story continuesPlus, Commercial Metals may be more intriguing to some investors for its attractive stock price compared to other industry titans like Nucor (NUE) and Steel Dynamics (STLD) which trade over $100 a share. Commercial Metal’s valuation seems to support this as well with CMC trading at $56 a share and just 7.6X forward earnings.This is below Nucor’s 13.1X and Steel Dynamics’ 10.9X forward earnings and nicely beneath the industry average of 9X. Plus, CMC stock trades 70% below its decade high of 25.3X and at a 34% discount to the median of 11.6X with earnings estimate revisions trending higher.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchCommercial Metal’s fiscal 2024 earnings estimates in particular are very intriguing. With China, the world’s largest steel consumer recently reopening its economy this is expected to broadly move the commodity price higher.In correlation, while Commercial Metals’ overall bottom-line growth is expected to cool down following several exceptional years, FY23 earnings estimates have slightly gone up and FY24 estimates have leaped 45% to $5.59 per share over the last quarter.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchOver the last year, CMC stock is up +53% to crush the S&amp;P 500 and easily top the Steel-Producers Markets +14%. Also, while this trailed Steel Dynamics’ +95% it has beat Nucor’s +39%.In the last three years, CMC’s +172% has trailed NUE and STLD but has impressively outperformed the benchmark and its Zacks Subindustry’s +100%.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchTakeawayWith egg and steel prices remaining above historical levels, Cal-Maine Foods and Commercial Metals look poised to continue benefiting from higher commodity prices. Both stocks are still attractive at their current levels and have given investors the opportunity to profit from higher inflation, providing a defensive hedge against the fed’s quantitative tightening cycle.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

12,48fef61b-a101-3190-9a4c-2f67100b76de,NUE,2023-02-16,Nucor Corporation (NUE) Is a Trending Stock: Facts to Know Before Betting on It,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/nucor-corporation-nue-trending-stock-140002487.html,1676469602,STORY,['NUE'],"[Nucor (NUE) has been one of the most searched-for stocks on Zacks.com lately. So, you might want to look at some of the facts that could shape the stock's performance in the near term.Shares of this steel company have returned +10.4% over the past month versus the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's +3.5% change. The Zacks Steel - Producers industry, to which Nucor belongs, has gained 3.5% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?Although media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.Revisions to Earnings EstimatesRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.Our analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.For the current quarter, Nucor is expected to post earnings of $4.07 per share, indicating a change of -46.9% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed +13.1% over the last 30 days.The consensus earnings estimate of $12.99 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of -54.9%. This estimate has changed +1.8% over the last 30 days.For the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $11.74 indicates a change of -9.7% from what Nucor is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed +5.2%.Story continuesHaving a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, Nucor is rated Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPS12-month consensus EPS estimate for NUE _12MonthEPSChartUrlRevenue Growth ForecastEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.In the case of Nucor, the consensus sales estimate of $8.26 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of -21.2%. The $30.96 billion and $29.04 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of -25.4% and -6.2%, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryNucor reported revenues of $8.72 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -15.8%. EPS of $4.89 for the same period compares with $7.97 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $7.91 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +10.29%. The EPS surprise was +16.99%.The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.ValuationNo investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.While comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.As part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.Nucor is graded B on this front, indicating that it is trading at a discount to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.ConclusionThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Nucor. However, its Zacks Rank #1 does suggest that it may outperform the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Today's Research Daily features new research reports on 16 major stocks, including Merck &amp; Co., Inc. (MRK), Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc. (TMO) and American Express Co. (AXP). These research reports have been hand-picked from the roughly 70 reports published by our analyst team today.You can see all of today’s research reports here &gt;&gt;&gt;Merck’s shares have outperformed the Zacks Large Cap Pharmaceuticals industry over the past year (+39.8% vs. +11.8%). Drugs like Keytruda and Gardasil (HPV vaccine) have been driving sales. With continued label expansion into new indications &amp; early-stage settings, Keytruda is expected to remain a key top-line driver.Animal health and vaccine products are core growth drivers. Its new COVID oral antiviral pill, Lagevrio, has become a key top-line driver in 2022. Merck boasts a strong cancer pipeline, including Keytruda, which should help drive long-term growth.However, generic competition for several drugs and rising competitive pressure, mainly on the diabetes franchise, will continue to be overhangs on the top line. There are concerns about Merck’s ability to grow its non-oncology business ahead of Keytruda’s loss of exclusivity later in the decade.(You can read the full research report on Merck here &gt;&gt;&gt;)Shares of Thermo Fisher Scientific have outperformed the Zacks Medical - Instruments industry over the past year (+2.7% vs. -12.0%). The company’s robust year-over-year revenue growth in the Analytical Instruments and the Laboratory Products and Biopharma Services segments appears promising.Thermo Fisher’s accelerated investments to expand bioproduction capacity also buoy optimism. In the quarter, Thermo Fisher witnessed strength in three out of its four end markets. The upbeat guidance for 2022 is indicative that this growth momentum will continue.However, the year-over-year decline in revenues in the Life Science Solutions and Specialty Diagnostics segment is disappointing. The contraction of both margins on escalating costs and expenses does not bode well either. The year-over-year decline in adjusted earnings is concerning.(You can read the full research report on Thermo Fisher Scientific here &gt;&gt;&gt;)Shares of American Express have declined -8.6% over the past year against the Zacks Financial - Miscellaneous Services industry’s decline of -17.7%. Due to higher utilization of the company’s cards, expense in the form of card member services and card member rewards is likely to go up and strain the company's margins. Also, marketing and business development expenses are expected to rise, hurting the bottom line. As such, the stock warrants a cautious stance.Nevertheless, American Express have adopted several growth initiatives, such as launching new products, enhancing existing features, reaching new agreements and forging alliances, are boosting its revenues. Consumer spending on travel and entertainment, which carry higher margins for AmEx, is advancing well.The company’s balance sheet looks strong with manageable debt.

SEM will assume the role of the majority owner and managing partner of the newly planned facility as well as 13 outpatient physical therapy centers.With the latest JV, the keen interest of Select Medical in addressing the rising and evolving needs of inpatient and outpatient rehabilitative care across New Jersey is clearly reflected. Catering effectively to post-acute care requirements will instill patients’ trust on SEM, which, in turn, is expected to strengthen its foothold in the state.Select Medical often resorts to JVs with several U.S. healthcare providers through which it utilizes the collective expertise to extend advanced coordinated care across communities grappling with inadequate access to care.In the same month of the JV announcement with AtlantiCare, Select Medical announced another expansion initiative that it plans to pursue through its JV partnership with OhioHealth. The partners plan to construct a center comprising 12 beds and provide neuro transitional care across areas outside of central Ohio.Expansion initiatives similar to the latest one are likely to increase the rehabilitation hospital count of Select Medical, which stands at 31 as of Dec 31, 2022.

18,12570984-0eeb-321b-a071-2ea2a344d9a7,USB,2023-02-16,The past year for U.S. Bancorp (NYSE:USB) investors has not been profitable,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/past-u-bancorp-nyse-usb-130159676.html,1676552519,STORY,['USB-PQ'],"[While it may not be enough for some shareholders, we think it is good to see the U.S. Bancorp (NYSE:USB) share price up 13% in a single quarter. But that doesn't change the reality of under-performance over the last twelve months. The cold reality is that the stock has dropped 14% in one year, under-performing the market.It's worthwhile assessing if the company's economics have been moving in lockstep with these underwhelming shareholder returns, or if there is some disparity between the two. So let's do just that. Check out our latest analysis for U.S. Bancorp While the efficient markets hypothesis continues to be taught by some, it has been proven that markets are over-reactive dynamic systems, and investors are not always rational. One way to examine how market sentiment has changed over time is to look at the interaction between a company's share price and its earnings per share (EPS).Unfortunately U.S. Bancorp reported an EPS drop of 28% for the last year. This fall in the EPS is significantly worse than the 14% the share price fall. It may have been that the weak EPS was not as bad as some had feared.You can see below how EPS has changed over time (discover the exact values by clicking on the image).earnings-per-share-growthDive deeper into U.S. Bancorp's key metrics by checking this interactive graph of U.S. Bancorp's earnings, revenue and cash flow.What About Dividends?It is important to consider the total shareholder return, as well as the share price return, for any given stock. Whereas the share price return only reflects the change in the share price, the TSR includes the value of dividends (assuming they were reinvested) and the benefit of any discounted capital raising or spin-off. It's fair to say that the TSR gives a more complete picture for stocks that pay a dividend. We note that for U.S. Bancorp the TSR over the last 1 year was -11%, which is better than the share price return mentioned above. The dividends paid by the company have thusly boosted the total shareholder return.Story continuesA Different PerspectiveWe regret to report that U.S. Bancorp shareholders are down 11% for the year (even including dividends). Unfortunately, that's worse than the broader market decline of 5.9%. However, it could simply be that the share price has been impacted by broader market jitters. It might be worth keeping an eye on the fundamentals, in case there's a good opportunity. On the bright side, long term shareholders have made money, with a gain of 1.5% per year over half a decade. If the fundamental data continues to indicate long term sustainable growth, the current sell-off could be an opportunity worth considering. While it is well worth considering the different impacts that market conditions can have on the share price, there are other factors that are even more important. Consider risks, for instance. Every company has them, and we've spotted   2 warning signs for U.S. Bancorp   you should know about.If you are like me, then you will not want to miss this free list of growing companies that insiders are buying.Please note, the market returns quoted in this article reflect the market weighted average returns of stocks that currently trade on US exchanges.Have feedback on this article?

Net sales increased 2.7% from $2,540 million reported in the prior-year quarter.

(NYSE: CF), a leading global manufacturer of hydrogen and nitrogen products, today announced results for the full year and fourth quarter ended December 31, 2022.HighlightsFull year net earnings of $3.35 billion(1), or $16.38 per diluted share, EBITDA(2) of $5.54 billion, and adjusted EBITDA(2) of $5.88 billionFourth quarter net earnings of $860 million(1), or $4.35 per diluted share, EBITDA(2) of $1.25 billion, and adjusted EBITDA(2) of $1.30 billionFull year net cash from operating activities of $3.86 billion and free cash flow(3) of $2.78 billion; these amounts reflect the impact of $491 million in payments related to a Canada/U.S. tax matterRepurchased approximately 2.2 million shares for $223 million during the fourth quarter of 2022Signed a memorandum of understanding with JERA Co., Inc., Japan’s largest energy generator, regarding the supply of up to 500,000 metric tons per year of clean ammonia beginning in 2027""The CF Industries team delivered outstanding results in 2022, producing record financial performance for the fourth quarter and full year by working safely, operating our manufacturing and distribution assets extremely well, and serving our global customer base,"" said Tony Will, president and chief executive officer, CF Industries Holdings, Inc. ""At the same time, we drove significant progress across our clean energy and strategic initiatives by entering into our landmark carbon capture and sequestration partnership with ExxonMobil, commencing a front-end engineering and design study for our proposed blue ammonia plant in Louisiana, and being selected for advanced discussions with JERA Co. Inc., for the first significant volumes of ammonia as a clean energy source.Story continues""Looking ahead, we believe that the global nitrogen supply-demand balance and global energy cost structure will continue to present attractive margin opportunities for our cost-advantaged network. As a result, we expect to drive strong cash generation in the years ahead, enabling us to make disciplined investments in our clean energy initiatives to meet what we believe will be significant global demand for low-carbon ammonia while we continue to return substantial capital to shareholders.""Nitrogen Market OutlookGlobal nitrogen supply availability was tight for the first three quarters of 2022 but loosened in the fourth quarter of 2022 due to weak industrial demand in Europe and Asia, delayed purchasing in the agriculture sector and a partial recovery of European ammonia operating rates. With the spring application season approaching for the Northern Hemisphere, management believes substantial agriculture demand will emerge, supporting global nitrogen prices. Longer-term, management expects the global nitrogen supply-demand balance will remain tight into at least 2025 due to agriculture-led demand and forward energy curves that point to challenging production economics for producers in Europe and Asia.The need to replenish global grains stocks, which has supported high prices for corn, wheat and canola, continues to drive global nitrogen demand. Stocks-to-use ratios remain low for feed grains and oilseeds. Management believes that it will take at least two more years of harvests at trend yield to fully replenish global grains stocks, supporting strong grains plantings and incentivizing nitrogen fertilizer application over this time period.North America: Farm economics in the region are expected to remain positive for 2023, supported by strong crop futures prices and improving yields, assuming a return to normal weather conditions. Management projects 91-93 million acres of corn will be planted in the United States in the spring of 2023.India: Management expects that India will continue to be one of the world’s largest importers of urea in 2023 though overall urea imports may be lower than recent record highs if new domestic capacity adds to recently improved domestic production volumes.Brazil: Brazil imported an estimated 7 million metric tons of urea in 2022. Management expects demand for urea imports to remain strong in 2023 due to high crop prices, increases in planted acres and improved farm income levels.Europe: Management expects a higher-than-normal level of nitrogen imports into Europe in 2023 due to lower-than-normal ammonia operating rates in the region.Management expects global trade flows to continue to adjust to market dynamics that have affected global supply availability over the previous 18 months.Europe: Management believes that production economics in Europe will remain challenging as natural gas prices in the region, though lower than the highs of 2022, remain well above the 2015-2020 average. As a result, the Company does not expect full ammonia capacity production rates to return during the year, with some facilities continuing to favor importing ammonia to manufacture upgraded products.China: Urea exports from China were approximately 2.8 million metric tons in 2022 due to government measures to promote availability and affordability of fertilizers domestically. Management projects urea exports from China will be in a range of 2-3 million metric tons in 2023 under current measures before returning to a range of 3-5 million metric tons on an annual basis if government measures limiting exports are loosened.Russia: Exports of ammonia from Russia were significantly lower in 2022 compared to prior years due to geopolitical disruptions arising from Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and the resulting closure of the ammonia pipeline to the port of Odessa in Ukraine. In contrast, exports of other nitrogen products from Russia are at near-normal levels.Energy differentials between North America and marginal producers in Europe and Asia have compressed recently, but remain well above historical levels. Forward energy curves continue to suggest that these wider differentials will persist for an extended period. As a result, the Company believes the global nitrogen cost curve will remain steep, supporting significant margin opportunities for low-cost North American producers.Operations OverviewThe Company continues to operate safely and efficiently across its network. As of December 31, 2022, the 12-month rolling average recordable incident rate was 0.33 incidents per 200,000 work hours, significantly better than industry benchmarks.Gross ammonia production for the full year and fourth quarter of 2022 was approximately 9.8 million tons and 2.4 million tons, respectively. The Company expects that gross ammonia production for 2023 will be approximately 9.5 million tons(4).Financial Results OverviewFull Year 2022 Financial ResultsFor the full year 2022, net earnings attributable to common stockholders were $3.35 billion, or $16.38 per diluted share, and EBITDA was $5.54 billion, which include the impact of pre-tax impairment and restructuring charges of $258 million related to the Company’s U.K. operations, and adjusted EBITDA was $5.88 billion. These results compare to full year 2021 net earnings attributable to common stockholders of $917 million, or $4.24 per diluted share and EBITDA of $2.17 billion, which included the impact of pre-tax impairment charges of $521 million related to the Company’s U.K. operations, and adjusted EBITDA of $2.74 billion.Net sales for the full year 2022 were $11.19 billion compared to $6.54 billion for 2021. Average selling prices for 2022 were higher than 2021 across all segments due to decreased global supply availability, as higher global energy costs reduced global operating rates and geopolitical factors disrupted the global fertilizer supply chain. Sales volumes for 2022 decreased compared to 2021 due to lower ammonia, AN and Other product sales, mostly offset by higher urea and UAN sales.Cost of sales for 2022 was higher compared to 2021 due primarily to higher natural gas costs.In 2022, the average cost of natural gas reflected in the Company’s cost of sales was $7.18 per MMBtu compared to the average cost of natural gas in cost of sales of $4.21 per MMBtu in 2021.Fourth Quarter 2022 Financial ResultsFor the fourth quarter of 2022, net earnings attributable to common stockholders were $860 million, or $4.35 per diluted share, EBITDA was $1.25 billion, and adjusted EBITDA was $1.30 billion. These results compare to 2021 net earnings attributable to common stockholders of $705 million, or $3.27 per diluted share, EBITDA of $1.19 billion, and adjusted EBITDA of $1.26 billion.Net sales in the fourth quarter of 2022 were $2.61 billion compared to $2.54 billion in 2021. Average selling prices for 2022 were higher than 2021 for most segments due to decreased global supply as higher global energy costs reduced global operating rates and geopolitical factors disrupted the global fertilizer supply chain. Sales volumes in the fourth quarter of 2022 were lower than 2021 due primarily to lower ammonia and UAN sales.Cost of sales for the fourth quarter of 2022 were similar to 2021 as higher natural gas costs were offset by lower sales volumes.The average cost of natural gas reflected in the Company’s cost of sales was $6.88 per MMBtu in the fourth quarter of 2022 compared to the average cost of natural gas in cost of sales of $6.00 per MMBtu in the fourth quarter of 2021.Capital ManagementCapital ExpendituresCapital expenditures in the fourth quarter and full year 2022 were $134 million and $453 million, respectively, which incorporates expenditures related to the Company’s clean energy initiatives. Management projects capital expenditures for full year 2023 will be in the range of $500-$550 million.Share Repurchase ProgramsThe Company repurchased approximately 14.9 million shares for $1.35 billion during 2022. At the end of 2022, the Company had approximately $150 million remaining under the $1.5 billion share repurchase authorization that went into effect January 1, 2022, and is effective through the end of 2024.On November 2, 2022, the Board of Directors of CF Industries Holdings, Inc., authorized a new $3 billion share repurchase program. The program will commence upon completion of the current share repurchase program and is effective through the end of 2025.Canada/U.S. Tax MatterIn the first quarter of 2022, an arbitration panel decided in favor of the Canadian competent authority regarding a long-standing dispute dating back to the early 2000s between Canadian and U.S. tax authorities about the allocation of CF Industries’ profits and associated tax between the U.S. and Canada. As a result, the Company made payments in the second half of 2022 of $224 million in assessed tax and interest to Canadian taxing authorities for tax years 2006-2011. The Company is filing amended U.S. federal and state tax returns seeking refunds of related taxes paid in the United States.Additionally, the Company made payments of $267 million in the fourth quarter of 2022 in estimated tax and interest to Canada for tax years 2012-2020. The Company took this step in order to mitigate assessment of future interest by Canada while these tax years are being resolved through bilateral governmental procedures. Following the final assessment of tax and interest for tax years 2012 and after, the Company will file amended U.S. federal and state tax returns seeking refunds of related taxes paid in the United States.CHS Inc. DistributionOn January 31, 2023, the Board of Managers of CF Industries Nitrogen, LLC (CFN) approved a semi-annual distribution payment to CHS Inc. (CHS) of $255 million for the distribution period ended December 31, 2022. The distribution was paid on January 31, 2023. Distributions to CHS pertaining to 2022 distribution periods were approximately $627 million.Clean Energy InitiativesCF Industries continues to advance its plans to support the global hydrogen and clean fuel economy, which is expected to grow significantly over the next decade, through the production of blue ammonia (ammonia produced with the corresponding carbon dioxide (CO2) byproduct removed through carbon capture and sequestration) and green ammonia (ammonia produced from carbon-free sources).Memorandum of Understanding with JERA Co., Inc.On January 17, 2023, CF Industries announced that it had signed a memorandum of understanding (MOU) with JERA Co., Inc. (JERA), Japan’s largest energy generator, regarding the supply of up to 500,000 metric tons per year of clean ammonia beginning in 2027. The execution of the MOU is the result of a supplier comparison and evaluation process for the procurement of clean ammonia that JERA initiated in February 2022 for the world’s first commercial scale ammonia co-firing operations.The MOU establishes a framework for the companies to assess how CF Industries would best supply JERA with clean ammonia, which will be required to be produced with at least 60% lower carbon emissions than conventionally produced ammonia, under a long-term offtake agreement. The companies expect to evaluate a range of potential supply options, including an equity investment alongside CF Industries to develop a clean ammonia facility in Louisiana and a supplementary long-term offtake agreement.Proposed Joint Venture with Mitsui &amp; Co., Ltd. at CF Industries’ Blue Point ComplexCF Industries and Mitsui &amp; Co., Ltd. (Mitsui) continue to progress a front-end engineering and design (FEED) study, which is being conducted by thyssenkrupp UHDE, for their proposed joint venture to construct an export-oriented blue ammonia facility. CF Industries and Mitsui expect to make a final investment decision on the proposed facility in the second half of 2023. Construction and commissioning of a new world-scale ammonia plant typically takes approximately 4 years from that point.Should the companies agree to move forward, the ammonia facility would be constructed at CF Industries’ new Blue Point Complex. CF Industries acquired the land on the west bank of Ascension Parish, Louisiana, for the complex during the third quarter of 2022.Donaldsonville Complex Blue Ammonia ProjectEngineering activities for the construction of a dehydration and compression unit at the Donaldsonville Complex continue to advance, procurement of major equipment for the facility is in progress, and modification of the site’s existing equipment to allow integration with existing operations has begun. Once in service, the dehydration and compression unit will enable up to 2 million tons of process CO2 to be transported and stored.As previously announced, ExxonMobil will transport and permanently store the captured CO2 in secure geologic storage it owns in Vermilion Parish, Louisiana. As part of the project, ExxonMobil has signed an agreement with EnLink Midstream to use EnLink’s transportation network to deliver CO2 to permanent geologic storage. Start-up for the project is scheduled for early 2025.Donaldsonville Green Ammonia ProjectThe Donaldsonville green ammonia project, which involves installing an electrolysis system at the Donaldsonville Complex to generate carbon-free hydrogen from water that will then be supplied to an existing ammonia plant to produce green ammonia, continues to progress. Major equipment is being fabricated and site work is ongoing for installation of the new electrolyzer unit and integration into Donaldsonville’s existing operations. Once complete, the project will enable the Company to produce approximately 20,000 tons of green ammonia per year.___________________________________________________(1)Certain items recognized during the full year and fourth quarter of 2022 impacted our financial results and their comparability to the prior year periods.

The agreement involves the construction of an inpatient rehabilitation hospital in Galloway Township.While the construction of the hospital is likely to start in 2023, subject to state approvals, the same is expected to commence operations in 2024 or 2025. The facility formed as a result of the JV, named Bacharach Institute for Rehabilitation, will be furnished with innovative rehabilitative technologies to cure patients suffering from debilitating illnesses and injuries.The JV with AtlantiCare also encompasses joint management of operations of the 13 outpatient physical therapy centers situated in the southeastern region of New Jersey that form part of Select Medical’s NovaCare Rehabilitation brand. SEM will assume the role of the majority owner and managing partner of the newly planned facility as well as 13 outpatient physical therapy centers.With the latest JV, the keen interest of Select Medical in addressing the rising and evolving needs of inpatient and outpatient rehabilitative care across New Jersey is clearly reflected. Catering effectively to post-acute care requirements will instill patients’ trust on SEM, which, in turn, is expected to strengthen its foothold in the state.Select Medical often resorts to JVs with several U.S. healthcare providers through which it utilizes the collective expertise to extend advanced coordinated care across communities grappling with inadequate access to care.In the same month of the JV announcement with AtlantiCare, Select Medical announced another expansion initiative that it plans to pursue through its JV partnership with OhioHealth. The partners plan to construct a center comprising 12 beds and provide neuro transitional care across areas outside of central Ohio.Expansion initiatives similar to the latest one are likely to increase the rehabilitation hospital count of Select Medical, which stands at 31 as of Dec 31, 2022. Apart from inpatient rehabilitation hospitals, SEM’s care network comprises critical illness recovery hospitals and outpatient rehabilitation clinics of 103 and 1,928, respectively, across 39 states and the District of Columbia.Story continuesShares of Select Medical have gained 20.7% in a year compared with the industry’s 3.2% growth. Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment Research Zacks Rank &amp; Key PicksSelect Medical currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

He founded Gotham Capital in 1985, which delivered an annualized return of 50% from 1985 to 1994. In 2008, Greenblatt created Gotham Asset Management as the successor to his previous fund. He is currently serving as the Managing Principle and Co-Chief Investment Officer of the firm.Greenblatt is mainly known for his ‘Magic Formula’ investing technique, which he introduced in his book ‘The Little Book that Still Beats the Market’. This technique takes its inspiration from Buffett/Graham's value approach. According to this strategy, investors should focus on high-quality companies with cheap valuations and strong fundamentals. The strategy further elaborates that through return on capital employed (ROCE) and earnings yield investors can find a great combination of quality and cheap value stocks.Over the years, Joel Greenblatt’s investment technique has resulted in his hedge fund delivering solid returns to shareholders. Over the past three years, Gotham Large Value Fund (GVALX) has gained 10.6%, compared with a 9.88% return of the S&amp;P 500.As of the close of Q4 2022, Gotham Asset Management holds a 13F portfolio value of over $3.5 billion, compared with $3.3 billion in the previous quarter.

That tune began to change at the end of July and accelerated in August and September, as major players, such as Walmart (NYSE:WMT), has recently issued profit warnings and/or have withdrawn guidance.

This means that a few large firms play a dominant role. While collectively they comprise an oligopoly, individually they often have monopoly positions in particular narrower segments. Their main counterparty is the US government, a key customer in what is known as a monopsonist position. This is a rather unusual situation, but one that is very advantageous for companies such as LMT. (Click here to see the full text)7.

(NYSE:XYL) stock is about to trade ex-dividend in 4 days. The ex-dividend date is one business day before the record date, which is the cut-off date for shareholders to be present on the company's books to be eligible for a dividend payment. The ex-dividend date is of consequence because whenever a stock is bought or sold, the trade takes at least two business day to settle. Thus, you can purchase Xylem's shares before the 21st of February in order to receive the dividend, which the company will pay on the 22nd of March.The company's upcoming dividend is US$0.33 a share, following on from the last 12 months, when the company distributed a total of US$1.32 per share to shareholders. Based on the last year's worth of payments, Xylem stock has a trailing yield of around 1.2% on the current share price of $107.88. We love seeing companies pay a dividend, but it's also important to be sure that laying the golden eggs isn't going to kill our golden goose! So we need to check whether the dividend payments are covered, and if earnings are growing. See our latest analysis for Xylem If a company pays out more in dividends than it earned, then the dividend might become unsustainable - hardly an ideal situation. Xylem paid out 61% of its earnings to investors last year, a normal payout level for most businesses. Yet cash flow is typically more important than profit for assessing dividend sustainability, so we should always check if the company generated enough cash to afford its dividend. Over the last year it paid out 56% of its free cash flow as dividends, within the usual range for most companies.It's positive to see that Xylem's dividend is covered by both profits and cash flow, since this is generally a sign that the dividend is sustainable, and a lower payout ratio usually suggests a greater margin of safety before the dividend gets cut.Click here to see the company's payout ratio, plus analyst estimates of its future dividends.Story continueshistoric-dividendHave Earnings And Dividends Been Growing?Companies that aren't growing their earnings can still be valuable, but it is even more important to assess the sustainability of the dividend if it looks like the company will struggle to grow. If business enters a downturn and the dividend is cut, the company could see its value fall precipitously. It's not encouraging to see that Xylem's earnings are effectively flat over the past five years. It's better than seeing them drop, certainly, but over the long term, all of the best dividend stocks are able to meaningfully grow their earnings per share. Earnings growth has been slim and the company is paying out more than half of its earnings. While there is some room to both increase the payout ratio and reinvest in the business, generally the higher a payout ratio goes, the lower a company's prospects for future growth.The main way most investors will assess a company's dividend prospects is by checking the historical rate of dividend growth. Xylem has delivered 13% dividend growth per year on average over the past 10 years.Final TakeawayHas Xylem got what it takes to maintain its dividend payments? Earnings per share have barely grown, and although Xylem paid out over half its earnings and free cash flow last year, the payout ratios are within a normal range for most companies. In summary, it's hard to get excited about Xylem from a dividend perspective.If you want to look further into Xylem, it's worth knowing the risks this business faces.

If you want to see more stocks in this selection, check out 5 Stocks Big Short Michael Burry Is Buying and Selling. Big Short investor Michael Burry of Scion Asset Management, along with hedge fund managers Farallon Capital Management and Coatue Management, made significant investments in Chinese companies prior to the reopening of China's borders in January. This reopening followed nearly three years of restrictions on travel and commerce. According to Q4 2022 filings, Burry, who gained fame for his successful bet against U.S. real estate before the 2008 financial crisis, has taken new positions in two Chinese companies. He bought 75,000 shares of Chinese e-commerce firm JD.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:JD) and 50,000 shares of Chinese technology giant Alibaba Group Holding Limited (NYSE:BABA) in the December quarter. Bank of America Global Research data indicates that the reopening of China has led to an influx of investment in emerging market equities, causing record levels of inflows.Michael Burry has suggested that the current surge in stocks resembles the dot-com bubble and could end in a similarly devastating crash. Burry recently shared a chart on Twitter that shows the S&amp;P 500's significant drop between February 2001 and October 2002, along with the decline in the Federal Reserve's benchmark interest rate during that time. He wrote, ""This time is different,"" which is likely a dig at commentators who believe the current market rally is sustainable. Burry's latest chart and comment suggest that he sees similarities between the current market surge and the one in early 2001, when interest rates were at 6%, and he expects both the S&amp;P 500 and the Fed Funds rate to eventually drop, with the Fed cutting rates as the economy weakens and asset prices decline. ""All Theaters are Overcrowded""Burry has been warning about stocks for a while, and in January, he shared a similar chart that highlighted the S&amp;P 500's rally between September 2001 and March 2002 before it bottomed out six months later. He has previously advised investors to ""sell"" and warned that the S&amp;P 500 could drop by over 50% to around 1,900 points. He has also cautioned that the Fed may hesitate to intervene in order to support asset prices, as it could intensify inflation.Story continuesHe tweeted back in October 2022: ""Difference between now and 2000 is the passive investing bubble that inflated steadily over the last decade. All theaters are overcrowded and the only way anyone can get out is by trampling each other. And still the door is only so big.""To navigate the uncertain equity market in 2023, some of the stocks that Big Short Michael Burry is buying include Black Knight, Inc.

SBC) by 2024, meaning shares have been trading in a range of 4-6x price to free cash flow. The Partnership has been a buyer at these levels.”9. SkyWest, Inc.

Wall Street clearly dives into all of the other metrics and management's input, but the EPS figure helps cut through all the noise.Life and the stock market are both about expectations, and rising above what is expected is often rewarded, while falling short can come with negative consequences. Investors might want to try to capture stronger returns by finding positive earnings surprises.2 Stocks to Add to Your WatchlistThe Zacks Earnings ESP, or Expected Surprise Prediction, aims to find earnings surprises by focusing on the most recent analyst revisions. The basic premise is that if an analyst reevaluates their earnings estimate ahead of an earnings release, it means they likely have new information that could possibly be more accurate. The core of the ESP model is comparing the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate, where the resulting percentage difference between the two equals the Expected Surprise Prediction.The last thing we will do today, now that we have a grasp on the ESP and how powerful of a tool it can be, is to look at a qualifying stock. Arbor Realty Trust (ABR) holds a Zacks Rank #3 at the moment and its Most Accurate Estimate comes in at $0.48 a share two days away from its upcoming earnings release on February 17, 2023.ABR has an Earnings ESP figure of 2.86%, which, as explained above, is calculated by taking the percentage difference between the $0.48 Most Accurate Estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $0.47.ABR is just one of a large group of Finance stocks with a positive ESP figure. MetLife (MET) is another qualifying stock you may want to consider.MetLife is a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock, and is getting ready to report earnings on May 3, 2023. MET's Most Accurate Estimate sits at $1.95 a share 77 days from its next earnings release.MetLife's Earnings ESP figure currently stands at 0.89% after taking the percentage difference between its Most Accurate Estimate and its Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.93.Story continuesABR and MET's positive ESP metrics may signal that a positive earnings surprise for both stocks is on the horizon.Find Stocks to Buy or Sell Before They're ReportedUse the Zacks Earnings ESP Filter to turn up stocks with the highest probability of positively, or negatively, surprising to buy or sell before they're reported for profitable earnings season trading.

The state is facing an election in late March.""We don’t know how the NSW Treasurer can talk about levelling the playing field for coal companies,"" Glencore said in an emailed statement.""Under the updated directions Glencore, which produces about 30% of NSW’s thermal coal, is expected to provide up to 65% of the coal shortfall.""Yancoal Australia and Whitehaven also said they would be impacted.From April 2023 to June 2024, Yancoal will make up to 310,000 tonnes of coal available per quarter for domestic use, while Whitehaven will set aside either 200,000 tonnes or 5% of each of its mine's thermal coal production per quarter, whichever is lower, the companies said on Thursday.Shares in Whitehaven tumbled as much as 12.3% to hit a near six-month low before paring most gains to trade down 2.7%. Yancoal stock dropped 2.3%, while fellow coal miner New Hope Corp slipped 3.8%.The NSW government during its talks with Yancoal on the latest policy told the company it would not be compensated for the difference between market rates and the price it receives selling volumes under the policy, the coal miner said.Story continuesYancoal, however, said it could be eligible for a compensation in certain situations if costs incurred exceed the capped price of coal. Similarly, Whitehaven noted that an application could be made to raise the price cap under certain circumstances.A notice published by the NSW government showed that mines owned by BHP Group and Peabody Energy will also have to comply with the legislation.BHP has said the new policy could affect its plan to keep its Mt Arthur coal mine, the state's largest single coal mine, open until 2030.(Reporting by Melanie Burton in Melbourne Harish Sridharan and Sameer Manekar in Bengaluru; Editing by Subhranshu Sahu, Rashmi Aich and Michael Perry)]"

""The United States and Europe are not in a complete recession yet, but I think the world economy is probably going to get a little worse, so it will be even tougher in terms of exports.""The lifting of China's zero-COVID policy late last year, however, might somewhat brighten the outlook for a global economy teetering on the brink of a recession, he added.The value of Japan's merchandise exports in January was 3.5% higher than a year earlier, Ministry of Finance (MOF) data showed, slowing sharply from the previous month's annual gain of 11.5% but beating economists' median estimate for a 0.8% rise.Imports of goods were up 17.8%, compared with the rise of 20.7% in the previous month and a median forecast for 18.4%.The result was a 3.49 trillion yen ($26.07 billion) deficit in merchandise trade in January, the biggest in records going back to 1979, the data showed. Imports of coal, liquefied natural gas and crude oil drove up overall import bills.Story continues""With commodity inflation peaking and the yen unlikely to weaken further, import prices are likely to decline from now on, but exports are still trending downward, so trade deficits will persist,"" said Kenta Maruyama, economist at Mitsubishi UFJ Research and Consulting.By region, January exports of goods to China, Japan's largest trading partner, fell 17.1% from a year earlier, dragged down by shipments of cars, car parts and chip-making equipment, the data showed.U.S.-bound shipments were 10.2% higher, led by demand for cars, mining machinery and metal processing machinery.Separate data showed core machinery orders, a highly volatile data series regarded as an indicator of capital spending in the coming six to nine months, was 1.6% higher in December, compared with a 3.0% rise expected by economists.Data issued on Monday showed Japan's economy, the world's third largest, had grown at an annualised rate of only 0.6 in the fourth quarter as business investment slumped.Japan reports trade in services separately, in its current account data.($1 = 133.8600 yen) (Reporting by Tetsushi Kajimoto; Additional reporting by Eimi Yamamitsu; Editing by Bradley Perrett)]"

This compares to FFO of $0.37 per share a year ago. These figures are adjusted for non-recurring items.A quarter ago, it was expected that this company would post FFO of $0.38 per share when it actually produced FFO of $0.38, delivering no surprise.Over the last four quarters, the company has surpassed consensus FFO estimates just once.Essential Properties , which belongs to the Zacks REIT and Equity Trust - Retail industry, posted revenues of $74.28 million for the quarter ended December 2022, missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 2.52%. This compares to year-ago revenues of $65.02 million. The company has topped consensus revenue estimates two times over the last four quarters.The sustainability of the stock's immediate price movement based on the recently-released numbers and future FFO expectations will mostly depend on management's commentary on the earnings call.Essential Properties shares have added about 5.1% since the beginning of the year versus the S&amp;P 500's gain of 7.7%.What's Next for Essential Properties?While Essential Properties has underperformed the market so far this year, the question that comes to investors' minds is: what's next for the stock?There are no easy answers to this key question, but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company's FFO outlook. Not only does this include current consensus FFO expectations for the coming quarter(s), but also how these expectations have changed lately.Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near-term stock movements and trends in estimate revisions. Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried-and-tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank, which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of estimate revisions.Ahead of this earnings release, the estimate revisions trend for Essential Properties: mixed. While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company's just-released earnings report, the current status translates into a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for the stock. So, the shares are expected to perform in line with the market in the near future. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Story continuesIt will be interesting to see how estimates for the coming quarters and current fiscal year change in the days ahead. The current consensus FFO estimate is $0.40 on $79.7 million in revenues for the coming quarter and $1.63 on $340.26 million in revenues for the current fiscal year.Investors should be mindful of the fact that the outlook for the industry can have a material impact on the performance of the stock as well. In terms of the Zacks Industry Rank, REIT and Equity Trust - Retail is currently in the bottom 28% of the 250 plus Zacks industries. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperform the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.Another stock from the same industry, Realty Income Corp. (O), has yet to report results for the quarter ended December 2022. The results are expected to be released on February 21.This real estate investment trust is expected to post quarterly earnings of $0.98 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +4.3%.

Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: The Coca-Cola Co. KO, Caterpillar Inc.'s CAT, salesforce.com Inc. CRM, The Procter &amp; Gamble Co. PG and Visa Inc.'s V.Here are highlights from Tuesday’s Analyst Blog:5 Blue-Chip Stocks to Buy Despite Sluggish Start to the YearU.S. stock markets have rallied year to date. after  wrapping up 2022 as the worst year since 2008, terminating a three-year winning streak. Major stock indexes suffered a huge blow last year. However, the Dow suffered the least.Dow Changes Course in 2023In 2022, the Dow fell 8.8% year over year, while the S&amp;P 500 and the Nasdaq Composite plummeted 19.4% and 33.1%, respectively. Last year, the Fed raised the benchmark interest rate by 4.25% to combat 40-year high inflation.A higher interest rate is detrimental to growth stocks like consumer discretionary and technology. In contrast to the Nasdaq Composite and the S&amp;P 500 indexes, the 30-stock Dow is more inclined to cyclical stocks than growth stocks. Therefore, the index suffered the least. However, the situation has taken a turn in 2023.Dow Lags Peers Year to DateLess-than-expected inflation rates in October, November and December with respect to several measures have clearly indicated this. On Jan 31, the Department of Labor reported that the employment cost index for fourth-quarter 2022 rose 1%, below the consensus mark of a 1.2% rise. The metric for third-quarter 2022 was also 1.2%. The data clearly indicates that the wage rate, a major source of current inflation, is declining as expected by the Fed.On Feb 1, in its February FOMC meeting, the Fed hiked the benchmark interest rate by 25 basis points to the range of 4.50% to 4.75%, marking its highest rate since late 2007. Market participants are expecting two more rate hikes of 25 basis points each in 2023.Story continuesThe technology sector is no longer overvalued. We are seeing early signs of market participants' confidence returning to this sector. Of the three major stock indexes — year to date — The S&amp;P 500 and the Nasdaq Composite advanced 7.8% and 13.6%, respectively. The Dow gained just 3.3%.U.S. Economy CoolingThe U.S. economy expanded 2.9% in fourth-quarter 2022. Although the metric exceeded the consensus mark of 2.6%, it declined from the third-quarter's growth rate of 3.2%. The latest projection by the Atlanta Fed revealed that the U.S. economy may have expanded by 2.2% in first-quarter 2023.A devastated housing market owing to the high mortgage rate, disappointing retail sales in December, the peak festive season, huge inventory accumulation by several retailers, a sharp fall in U.S. manufacturing activities and a notable decline in factory orders and industrial production indicated that the U.S. economy is cooling in the direction desired by the Fed.Moreover, several U.S. corporate behemoths have already retrenched manpower to a good extent at high levels. Lack of earnings visibility due to some near-term concerns related to business opportunities is the primary reason for recent job cuts.Market participants are expecting more softness in consumer spending and a decline in business spending due to a margin squeeze resulting in moderate GDP growth. Powell also warned of some toughness going forward. As a result, growth and momentum stocks may underperform cyclical value stocks in 2023. Our Top PicksWe have narrowed our search to five blue-chip (components of Dow) stocks with strong potential for 2023. These stocks have seen positive earnings estimate revisions in the last 60 days. Each of our picks carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.The Coca-Cola Co. has benefited from its strategic transformation and ongoing recovery around the world.

52,fe526f2e-764e-3025-835d-ae72be4bd819,FLS,2023-02-16,Shareholders 14% loss in Flowserve (NYSE:FLS) partly attributable to the company's decline in earnings over past three years,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/shareholders-14-loss-flowserve-nyse-123942480.html,1676551182,STORY,['FLS'],"[Flowserve Corporation (NYSE:FLS) shareholders should be happy to see the share price up 17% in the last quarter. But that cannot eclipse the less-than-impressive returns over the last three years. Truth be told the share price declined 21% in three years and that return, Dear Reader, falls short of what you could have got from passive investing with an index fund.Although the past week has been more reassuring for shareholders, they're still in the red over the last three years, so let's see if the underlying business has been responsible for the decline. See our latest analysis for Flowserve While the efficient markets hypothesis continues to be taught by some, it has been proven that markets are over-reactive dynamic systems, and investors are not always rational. One flawed but reasonable way to assess how sentiment around a company has changed is to compare the earnings per share (EPS) with the share price.Flowserve saw its EPS decline at a compound rate of 28% per year, over the last three years. In comparison the 7% compound annual share price decline isn't as bad as the EPS drop-off. So, despite the prior disappointment, shareholders must have some confidence the situation will improve, longer term. This positive sentiment is also reflected in the generous P/E ratio of 57.12.The company's earnings per share (over time) is depicted in the image below (click to see the exact numbers).earnings-per-share-growthBefore buying or selling a stock, we always recommend a close examination of historic growth trends, available here.What About Dividends?As well as measuring the share price return, investors should also consider the total shareholder return (TSR). The TSR incorporates the value of any spin-offs or discounted capital raisings, along with any dividends, based on the assumption that the dividends are reinvested. Arguably, the TSR gives a more comprehensive picture of the return generated by a stock. We note that for Flowserve the TSR over the last 3 years was -14%, which is better than the share price return mentioned above. And there's no prize for guessing that the dividend payments largely explain the divergence!Story continuesA Different PerspectiveWe're pleased to report that Flowserve shareholders have received a total shareholder return of 16% over one year. And that does include the dividend. There's no doubt those recent returns are much better than the TSR loss of 1.1% per year over five years. This makes us a little wary, but the business might have turned around its fortunes. While it is well worth considering the different impacts that market conditions can have on the share price, there are other factors that are even more important. Case in point: We've spotted   4 warning signs for Flowserve  you should be aware of, and 2 of them are a bit unpleasant.We will like Flowserve better if we see some big insider buys.

But to think the macroeconomic concerns have faded is wrong. The central bank is expected to keep interest rates high till inflation comes down reasonably.This has made investors cautious, as higher rates will likely lead to a recession/economic slowdown this year. The bearish sentiments are leading to huge market volatility, making it difficult for individual investors to pick stocks independently and generate solid returns. One way to choose the right stocks in the current situation is to follow rating upgrades by brokers. In this regard, stocks like The Kroger Co. KR, Expedia Group, Inc. EXPE and Ralph Lauren Corporation RL are worth a look.As brokers directly communicate with the top management, they have a deeper understanding of what is happening in a particular company. They precisely assess companies’ publicly available documents and even attend conference calls.Brokers have an extra understanding of the overall sector and industry. They place company fundamentals against the current economic backdrop to determine how a particular stock will fare as an investment.So, when brokers upgrade a stock, you can rely on their judgment. But solely depending on broker upgrades is not a good way to build your investment portfolio. Several other factors should be taken into consideration to ensure steady returns.Selecting the Winning StrategyWe have a screening strategy that will help you in your search for potential winners:Broker Rating Upgrades (Four Weeks) of 1% or More: The screen selects stocks that have witnessed broker rating upgrades of 1% or more over the last four weeks.Current Price Greater Than $5: The stocks must trade above $5.Average 20-Day Volume Greater Than 100,000: A large trading volume guarantees that the stock is easily tradable.Zacks Rank Equal to #1 or 2: Despite good or bad market conditions, stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) have a proven record of success. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.VGM Score of A or B: Our research shows that stocks with a VGM Score of A or B, when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 or 2, offer the best upside potential.Here are three stocks that qualified for the screening:Cincinnati, OH-based Kroger operates supermarkets under banners including Kroger, City Market, Dillons, Food 4 Less, Fred Meyer, Fry's, Harris Teeter, Jay C, King Soopers, Mariano's, Pick 'n Save, QFC, Ralphs and Smith's. Further, KR manufactures and processes certain food products sold in its supermarkets.The company’s earnings for fiscal 2024 are expected to increase 1.9%. Kroger, currently carrying a Zacks Rank #2, has witnessed a 6.3% upward revision in broker ratings over the past four weeks.Headquartered in Seattle, WA, Expedia is one of the largest online travel companies in the world. EXPE’s web portals focus on travel planning, travel purchases and travel experience sharing, thus bringing suppliers and consumers of travel-related services together.Expedia’s 2023 earnings are projected to rise 36.2%. The company, sporting a Zacks Rank #1 at present, has witnessed a 5% upward revision in broker ratings over the past four weeks.Ralph Lauren, based in New York, is a major designer, marketer and distributor of premium lifestyle products. RL offers products in apparel, footwear, accessories, home furnishings and other licensed product categories.Ralph Lauren’s fiscal 2024 earnings are projected to rise 14.3%.

But which of these two stocks presents investors with the better value opportunity right now? Let's take a closer look.We have found that the best way to discover great value opportunities is to pair a strong Zacks Rank with a great grade in the Value category of our Style Scores system. The proven Zacks Rank emphasizes companies with positive estimate revision trends, and our Style Scores highlight stocks with specific traits.Currently, both Ralph Lauren and LVMH-Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton SA are holding a Zacks Rank of # 1 (Strong Buy). This means that both companies have witnessed positive earnings estimate revisions, so investors should feel comfortable knowing that both of these stocks have an improving earnings outlook. But this is only part of the picture for value investors.Value investors are also interested in a number of tried-and-true valuation metrics that help show when a company is undervalued at its current share price levels.Our Value category highlights undervalued companies by looking at a variety of key metrics, including the popular P/E ratio, as well as the P/S ratio, earnings yield, cash flow per share, and a variety of other fundamentals that have been used by value investors for years.RL currently has a forward P/E ratio of 15.16, while LVMUY has a forward P/E of 24.93. We also note that RL has a PEG ratio of 1.61. This popular metric is similar to the widely-known P/E ratio, with the difference being that the PEG ratio also takes into account the company's expected earnings growth rate. LVMUY currently has a PEG ratio of 1.77.Another notable valuation metric for RL is its P/B ratio of 3.26. Investors use the P/B ratio to look at a stock's market value versus its book value, which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities. By comparison, LVMUY has a P/B of 7.66.Story continuesBased on these metrics and many more, RL holds a Value grade of B, while LVMUY has a Value grade of F.Both RL and LVMUY are impressive stocks with solid earnings outlooks, but based on these valuation figures, we feel that RL is the superior value option right now.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Berkshire Hathaway reduced its ownership of Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (NYSE:TSM)'s American depositary receipts by 86% in the fourth quarter, according to the latest filings. If Berkshire sold the shares at the average price during that time, the sale of the stake would have raked in $3.7 billion. In the wake of this announcement, the stock prices of the world's largest chip manufacturer declined by up to 4% in Taipei, contributing to widespread losses in the market.Tony Huang, vice president at Taishin Securities Investment Advisory Co, told Bloomberg on February 15: “It’s surprising that Berkshire cut its holding so much in just a quarter, which differs from its past practice of long-term investment and continuing to add shares.”While Berkshire Hathaway opted to sell its holdings in Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (NYSE:TSM), it added 333,856 shares to its position in Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL). For Q4 2022, Apple reported its worst revenue results for a holiday season in seven years.Some of the best long-term stocks to buy according to Warren Buffett include The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO), American Express Company (NYSE:AXP), and Bank of America Corporation (NYSE:BAC). Our MethodologyWe selected the stocks from the Q4 portfolio of Berkshire which have been part of the fund's portfolio for at least 5 years.

The biggest component of this increase was the introduction of a 4% weight in Apple, which is discussed further below. Offsetting this increased tech weight was a 3-percentage point decrease in industrials and a two-percentage point decline in health care. The other two largest purchases include Visa Inc. (NYSE:V) and Abbott Labs which likewise saw their valuations improve as their estimated free cash flows held up or improved while their enterprise values declined.”8. VeriSign, Inc.

DaVita Inc. (NYSE:DVA)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 30Berkshire’s Holding Period: 11 YearsBerkshire’s Stake Value: $2,695,256,212DaVita Inc. (NYSE:DVA) is a Colorado-based company that provides kidney dialysis services for patients suffering from chronic kidney failure. In Q4 2022, Buffett owned 36 million shares of DaVita Inc. (NYSE:DVA) worth $2.7 billion, representing 0.90% of the total 13F securities. It is one of the long-term stock picks of Buffett, featuring on the Berkshire portfolio for 11 years. On November 1, Pito Chickering, an analyst at Deutsche Bank, lowered DaVita Inc. (NYSE:DVA)’s rating from Buy to Hold and set a new price target of $72, down from $97, following the release of its Q3 results. The analyst informed investors that healthcare service providers have been affected by inflationary pressures in 2022, and DaVita has managed these challenges exceptionally well. However, he attributes the downgrade to the issue of patients missing appointments at dialysis clinics in Q3 and the company's guidance on this matter.According to Insider Monkey’s data, 30 hedge funds were bullish on DaVita Inc. (NYSE:DVA) at the end of Q3 2022, compared to 28 funds in the last quarter. Jeffrey Gates’ Gates Capital Management held a prominent stake in the company, consisting of 1.46 million shares worth $121.20 million. Moon Capital made the following comment about DaVita Inc. (NYSE:DVA) in its Q4 2022 investor letter:“During the fourth quarter, we purchased shares in DaVita Inc. (NYSE:DVA), a dialysis center operator. For those unfamiliar, kidney dialysis involves the critical removal of toxins, fluids and salts from the blood by artificial means. Roughly 500,000 patients receive kidney dialysis in the U.S., which requires a 3.5-hour treatment three times a week. The only alternatives to the treatments are a kidney transplant or potential fatality. Given the critical nature of its services, demand has little correlation with the overall economy, resulting in a highly recession resistant business.The U.S. dialysis industry is highly concentrated, with two companies (DaVita and its competitor Fresenius) controlling a combined 80% of the $25 billion market. The dominance of this duopoly provides massive scale advantages, making it incredibly difficult for new entrants to gain profitable market share.In the past, DaVita’s valuation has been penalized (we view unfairly) because the company generates a significant portion of its operating income from a small percentage of its patients. Of DaVita’s 200,000 patients, approximately 90% qualify for Medicare (or Medicaid), with the remaining 10% covered by a commercial insurance provider. While commercial insurers pay an average of $1,000 per treatment, the federal government’s pay rate for Medicare and Medicaid is only $275 – which is actually less than what it costs DVA to provide the treatment…”(Click here to read the full text)6. Moody's Corporation (NYSE:MCO)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 63Berkshire’s Holding Period: 12 YearsBerkshire’s Stake Value: $6,873,493,546Moody's Corporation (NYSE:MCO) is a New York-based integrated risk assessment firm that publishes credit ratings and provides assessment services on various debt obligations, programs and facilities, and entities that issue such obligations. Moody's Corporation (NYSE:MCO) has been in the Berkshire portfolio for 12 years. Buffett owns a $6.8 billion position in the company. On January 31, Moody's Corporation (NYSE:MCO) reported a Q4 non-GAAP EPS of $1.60, beating market estimates by $0.13. The revenue of $1.29 billion outperformed Wall Street consensus by $20 million. For FY2023, the company expects revenue to increase in the mid-to-high single digit percent range and adjusted diluted EPS of $9 to $9.50, versus a consensus of $9.28.Ashish Sabadra, an analyst from RBC Capital, increased the target price for Moody's Corporation (NYSE:MCO) on February 1 from $329 to $350 and maintained an Outperform rating on the company's shares after it exceeded Q4 earnings expectations. In a research note to investors, the analyst said that the company's FY23 guidance may be too cautious because of the anticipated strong recovery in issuance. Additionally, RBC Capital thinks that Moody's projected buyback guidance for 2023 is conservative and will result in only about half of its free cash flows being returned to shareholders.According to Insider Monkey’s third quarter database, 63 hedge funds were long Moody's Corporation (NYSE:MCO), compared to 48 funds in the preceding quarter. Chris Hohn’s TCI Fund Management is a significant position holder in the company, with 8.2 million shares worth $2 billion. In addition to The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO), American Express Company (NYSE:AXP), and Bank of America Corporation (NYSE:BAC), Moody's Corporation (NYSE:MCO) has featured on the Berkshire portfolio for several years.  Here is what Qualivian Investment Partners has to say about Moody’s Corporation (NYSE:MCO) in its Q2 2021 investor letter:“Moody’s: Revenue, operating profit margins, and EPS all exceeded expectations, and annual guidance for these items (and for free cash flow) was raised. In MIS (Moody’s Investors Service) which houses the traditional ratings business, the outlook for debt issuance was raised for the remainder of the year, while MA (Moody’s Analytics) also came in ahead of expectations. The company leveraged strong revenue growth with strong operating profit margin improvement of 200 bps, with EPS coming in $0.22 ahead of consensus estimates. Management alluded to having interesting opportunities in their M&amp;A pipeline, which we will have to assess when the time comes, but Moody’s management team has been very effective at allocating capital in the past toward value-creating bolt-on acquisitions, especially in their Moody’s Analytics business, a key growth driver for the company.” Click to continue reading and see 5 Best Long-Term Stocks To Buy According To Warren Buffett.  Suggested articles:13 Stocks Big Short Michael Burry is Buying and Selling10 Jim Cramer Stocks This Month10 Tech Stocks To Sell Now According to Cathie Wood Disclosure: None. 10 Best Long-Term Stocks To Buy According To Warren Buffett is originally published on Insider Monkey.]"

Is there any common thread between this story and Rupert Murdoch and the succession there and News Corp and the merger, which has now been called off?JAMES STEWART: Well, this book has been compared to the TV series ""Succession."" And having been watching it and I love it, it is clearly an amalgam of material taken from the Murdoch family, some taken from Sumner Redstone. But for some reason, in these big media companies, in particularly, succession is a huge issue. I mean, it's cropped up at Disney just recently. Look, they got rid of the chief executive. They had to bring Iger back.The Murdoch family is struggling to figure out how to do that. The unbelievable battle that went on here at Paramount Global, there does seem to be something about the spotlight that is on these media companies. And maybe it's just the sheer-- the glamor, the power, the fun, whatever people think it is. Nobody wants to give these up once they're in the leadership positions.On the other hand, if you think running one of these companies is going to make you happy or making the billions that Sumner Redstone did, this is a case study in how immense wealth does not bring happiness or peace of mind.DAVE BRIGGS: Yeah, no, thanks.JAMES STEWART: No.ALLIE CANAL: Yeah, and you mentioned Disney and Bob Iger what do you think will be key in that succession plan in order for it to not go horribly wrong like the last time?JAMES STEWART: Well, he said he's leaving in two years.ALLIE CANAL: Allegedly.JAMES STEWART: Allegedly.ALLIE CANAL: We'll see.JAMES STEWART: And I have to say that I don't know that there are many people that take that strictly at face value because it's two years isn't very long. And that's a massive company. If he hadn't groomed a successor before, it may take longer than two years. There are some talented people working there, but no obvious candidate to step in as soon as two years. AndStory continuesI mean, I tip my hat to Iger. He's a master of communication. Wall Street loves him. Already, the stock has gone up quite a bit. He managed to stand down the latest proxy challenge from Nelson Peltz. So it'll be really interesting to see what he can do there. But again, Disney, Paramount Global, even Netflix and Amazon, they're all facing the same fundamental issues, which is streaming so far has not proven to be a profitable business, except for the people making the streaming content.DAVE BRIGGS: Yeah, that's a difficult road. So he says he's going to-- Iger-- stay two years. Elon Musk now says he's going to stay at least through the end of this year at Twitter. He sat with Rupert Murdoch at the Super Bowl, if there's a common thread there. How do you think that story plays itself out at Twitter? Does anyone want to work for Elon?JAMES STEWART: Well, I will say this for Elon at Twitter. At least it has calmed down after the unbelievable chaos that was running rampant there. I just-- look, I'm not going to count the Musk out. The previous formula was not really working there. And although he's taken some really drastic measures, chopping the personnel, he is getting the costs down. The advertisers have fled, but will they come back? I wouldn't want to bet against him.DAVE BRIGGS: And you hear that a lot. He's done pretty well with Tesla and with SpaceX and most other things he's touched. Allie Canal, thank you. James Stewart. The book is ""Unscripted."" Check it out, some incredible storytelling. Great to see you, sir. Thank you.JAMES STEWART: Thank you.]"

Adjusted net income was $3,078 million, or $4.48 per diluted share. Net operating cash flow was $5,428 million, or $5,410 million before changes in working capital (adjusted CFO). Free cash flow was $3,978 million, or $3,947 million before changes in working capital and including Equatorial Guinea (E.G.) distributions (adjusted FCF).(PRNewsfoto/Marathon Oil Corporation)Marathon Oil reported fourth quarter 2022 net income of $525 million, or $0.82 per diluted share, which includes the impact of certain items not typically represented in analysts' earnings estimates and that would otherwise affect comparability of results. Adjusted net income was $563 million, or $0.88 per diluted share. Net operating cash flow was $1,127 million, and adjusted CFO was $1,104 million. Free cash flow was $794 million, and adjusted FCF was $763 million.HighlightsReturned 55% of adjusted CFO to shareholders in 2022 (75% of adjusted FCF), significantly exceeding minimum 40% Return of Capital Framework commitmentAchieved outstanding full year 2022 and fourth quarter financial and operational resultsSuccessfully closed Ensign Natural Resources acquisition during fourth quarter, materially increasing Eagle Ford scaleE.G. integrated gas business achieved 2022 equity earnings of $613 million2023 capital budget prioritizes FCF generation and meaningful return of capital to shareholders ""2022 marked another year of impressive delivery against every dimension of our Framework for Success,"" said chairman, president, and CEO Lee Tillman. ""We generated approximately $4 billion of free cash flow and returned $3 billion of capital back to our shareholders. We reduced our outstanding share count by 15% through accretive share repurchases, contributing to significant growth in per-share metrics, and we raised our base dividend three times. With 55% of our adjusted CFO returned to shareholders, our Return of Capital framework remains differentiated among our peers, particularly in an inflationary environment. We materially strengthened our portfolio by enhancing our Eagle Ford scale through the Ensign acquisition, checking every box of our disciplined acquisition criteria, including accretion to key financial metrics, our Return of Capital Framework, and our high-quality inventory life. Most importantly, we achieved these outstanding results while holding true to our core values, keeping our workforce safe, and delivering comprehensive ESG excellence.""Story continues""Looking ahead to 2023 and beyond,"" continued Mr. Tillman, ""I expect more of the same from our Company. The combination of our high-quality U.S. multi-basin portfolio and unique E.G. integrated gas business with increasing global LNG exposure leaves us well-positioned to deliver financial and operational results that compete not only with the best of our energy peers, but with the very best companies in the S&amp;P 500.""Return of Capital OverviewMarathon Oil's percentage of CFO return of capital framework provides clear visibility to shareholder returns, ensuring the shareholder gets the first call on cash flow generation and protecting shareholder distributions from capital inflation. In a $60/bbl WTI or higher price environment, the Company targets returning a minimum of 40% of adjusted CFO to equity investors.During 2022, Marathon Oil meaningfully exceeded its framework minimum, returning 55% of adjusted CFO (approximately $3.0 billion) to equity holders in the form of base dividends and share repurchases. Marathon Oil executed approximately $2.8 billion of share repurchases during 2022, driving a 15% reduction to outstanding share count and contributing to significant underlying improvement in all per-share metrics. Since Marathon Oil re-initiated its share repurchase program in October 2021, the Company has reduced its outstanding share count by more than 20%.Following the recent close of the Ensign Eagle Ford acquisition, the Company announced an 11% quarterly base dividend increase to $0.10 per share. The dividend increase is fully supported by incremental cash flow generation capacity from the Ensign acquisition. Marathon Oil has raised its base dividend seven times in the trailing eight quarters, representing a cumulative increase of over 230% since the beginning of 2021, fully consistent with the Company's commitment to pay a competitive and sustainable base dividend.For 2023, consistent with its framework, Marathon Oil expects to return at least 40% of adjusted CFO to shareholders, equating to a minimum shareholder return of $1.8 billion, assuming $80/bbl WTI, $3.00/MMBtu Henry Hub, and $20/MMBtu TTF commodity pricing.2023 Capital Budget and GuidanceMarathon Oil announced a $1.9 to $2.0 billion capital expenditure budget for 2023, fully consistent with the Company's disciplined capital allocation framework that prioritizes corporate returns and FCF generation.The 2023 program is expected to deliver $2.6 billion of adjusted FCF at a reinvestment rate of approximately 40%, assuming $80/bbl WTI, $3.00/MMBtu Henry Hub, and $20/MMBtu TTF.Marathon Oil expects to deliver maintenance-level total Company oil production of 190,000 net bopd at the midpoint of its 2023 guidance range. Total Company oil-equivalent production is expected to be 395,000 net boed at the midpoint of guidance, inclusive of downtime associated with a planned second quarter E.G. turnaround.During 2023, Marathon Oil plans to average approximately nine rigs and three to four frac crews, excluding joint venture-related activity. The Company expects to run approximately four rigs and two frac crews in the Eagle Ford, including on its newly acquired acreage from Ensign.Marathon Oil has not assumed any U.S. cash federal income tax payments in its 2023 financial guidance.4Q22 OperationsUNITED STATES (U.S.): U.S. production averaged 278,000 net barrels of oil equivalent per day (boed) for fourth quarter 2022. Oil production averaged 156,000 net barrels of oil per day (bopd). Winter Storm Elliot negatively affected fourth quarter oil production by approximately 5,000 net bopd, with the impact primarily concentrated in the Bakken. U.S. unit production costs were $6.29 per boe for fourth quarter.The Company brought a total of 22 gross Company-operated wells to sales during fourth quarter. Marathon Oil's fourth quarter production in the Eagle Ford averaged 91,000 net boed, including 62,000 net bopd of oil, with 12 gross Company-operated wells to sales. In the Bakken, production averaged 94,000 net boed, including oil production of 59,000 net bopd, with four gross Company-operated wells to sales. Oklahoma production averaged 50,000 net boed, including oil production of 11,000 net bopd. Northern Delaware production averaged 33,000 net boed, including oil production of 20,000 net bopd, with six gross company-operated wells to sales.ENSIGN NATURAL RESOURCES ACQUISITION: As previously announced, Marathon Oil closed on the acquisition of the Eagle Ford assets of Ensign Natural Resources on Dec. 27, 2022. The acquisition is expected to be immediately and significantly accretive to Marathon Oil's key financial metrics and Return of Capital Framework; adds more than 600 high-quality undrilled locations, representing an inventory life greater than 15 years; and materially increases Marathon Oil's Eagle Ford scale. Early integration of the asset is progressing ahead of schedule, and initial well performance is exceeding expectations. Since acquisition close, Marathon Oil has brought nine wells to sales with average 30-day initial production rates delivering top decile oil productivity in the Eagle Ford.INTERNATIONAL: E.G. production averaged 55,000 net boed for fourth quarter, including 10,000 net bopd of oil. Unit production costs averaged $3.94 per boe. Fourth quarter net income from equity method investees totaled $144 million while total dividends from equity method companies amounted to $136 million.Corporate Overview2022 RESERVES: Year-end 2022 proved reserves totaled 1,338 million barrels of oil equivalent (mmboe), an increase of 232 mmboe, or 21%, compared to year-end 2021 proved reserves. 2022 proved reserve additions were primarily attributable to acquisitions, the expansion of proved areas, higher commodity prices, and 5-year plan optimization. Oil and liquids accounted for 48% and 71% of the Company's year-end 2022 proved reserves, respectively.BALANCE SHEET AND LIQUIDITY: Marathon Oil ended fourth quarter with total liquidity of $2.4 billion, including $334 million of cash and cash equivalents and available borrowings on the Company's revolving credit facility that has been extended to 2027.FOURTH QUARTER ADJUSTMENTS TO NET INCOME: The adjustments to net income for fourth quarter totaled $38 million, primarily due to net losses on asset sales, transaction fees associated with the Ensign acquisition, and other non-core expenses, partially offset by the income impact related to net unrealized gains on derivative instruments.ESG ExcellenceSAFETY: Marathon Oil holds safety as a core value and a key component of its ESG commitment. The Company strives to provide safe, healthy, and secure workplaces by maintaining strong safety performance, as measured by Total Recordable Incident Rate1 (TRIR) for employees and contractors. During 2022, Marathon Oil achieved a TRIR of 0.30. Marathon Oil's safety performance remains a key element of its executive compensation scorecard, underscoring the Company's commitment to keeping its employees and contractors safe.ENVIRONMENTAL: Marathon Oil aims to help meet global oil and gas demand with strong environmental performance by driving significant improvement to both the greenhouse gas (GHG) and methane intensity of its operations, consistent with the trajectory of the Paris Climate Agreement. The Company continues to execute against a combination of near-term (2023), medium-term (2025), and longer-term (2030) goals covering GHG intensity, methane intensity, natural gas capture, and zero routine flaring. The Company's annual GHG intensity remains a key element of its executive compensation scorecard.SOCIAL: Marathon Oil is committed to promoting a diverse and inclusive workplace, respecting human rights, and making strategic investments to build healthier, safer, more resilient, and stronger local communities. During 2022, Marathon Oil published its Equal Opportunity and Employment (EEO-1) data and released a new Human Rights Policy to further acknowledge its longstanding commitment to the dignity and rights of all people. Key strategic social investments during 2022 included: ongoing support of Equatorial Guinea's Bioko Island Malaria Elimination Project; partnership with the National Fish and Wildlife Foundation on grassland restoration projects in the Bakken; awarding grants to teachers across operating areas through the Unconventional Thinking in Teaching Program; and continued support of the Barbara Bush Houston Literacy Foundation My Home Library Program.GOVERNANCE:  Marathon Oil believes best-in-class governance is foundational to delivering shareholder value. The Company is especially focused on displaying industry leadership in aligning executive compensation with the most critical drivers of shareholder value and on maintaining an independent and diverse board of directors with strong skills and experience. During 2022, Marathon Oil continued to enhance its board of director oversight through its focus on refreshment, independence, and diversity. The Company elected two new board members in 2022. Eight of nine directors are independent, average director tenure remains below the S&amp;P 500 average while maintaining a diverse mix of short and longer-tenured directors, three directors are female (including the lead director), and two directors self-identify as ethnically/racially diverse.A slide deck and Quarterly Investor Packet will be posted to the Company's website following this release today, February 15.

Our presentation of adjusted net income (loss) and adjusted net income (loss) per share is a non-GAAP measure. Adjusted net income (loss) is defined as net income (loss) adjusted for gains or losses on dispositions, impairments of proved and certain unproved properties, goodwill and equity method investments, changes in our valuation allowance, unrealized derivative gains or losses on commodity and interest rate derivative instruments, effects of pension settlements and curtailments and other items that could be considered ""non-operating"" or ""non-core"" in nature. Management believes this is useful to investors as another tool to meaningfully represent our operating performance and to compare Marathon to certain competitors. Adjusted net income (loss) and adjusted net income (loss) per share should not be considered in isolation or as an alternative to, or more meaningful than, net income (loss) or net income (loss) per share as determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP.Our presentation of adjusted CFO is defined as net cash provided by operating activities adjusted for changes in working capital and is a non-GAAP measure. Management believes this is useful to investors as an indicator of Marathon's ability to generate cash quarterly or year-to-date by eliminating differences caused by the timing of certain working capital items. Adjusted CFO should not be considered in isolation or as an alternative to, or more meaningful than, net cash provided by operating activities as determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP.Our presentation of free cash flow is a non-GAAP measure. Free cash flow is defined as net cash provided by operating activities and cash additions to property, plant and equipment. Management believes this is useful to investors as a measure of Marathon's ability to fund its capital expenditure programs, service debt, and fund other distributions to stockholders. Free cash flow should not be considered in isolation or as an alternative to, or more meaningful than, net cash provided by operating activities as determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP.Our presentation of adjusted free cash flow is a non-GAAP measure. Adjusted free cash flow before dividend (""adjusted free cash flow"") is defined as adjusted CFO, capital expenditures (accrued), and EG return of capital and other. Management believes this is useful to investors as a measure of Marathon's ability to fund its capital expenditure programs, service debt, and fund other distributions to stockholders. Adjusted free cash flow should not be considered in isolation or as an alternative to, or more meaningful than, net cash provided by operating activities as determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP.Our presentation of capital expenditures (accrued) is a non-GAAP measure. Capital expenditures (accrued) is defined as cash additions to property, plant and equipment adjusted for the change in capital accrual and additions to other assets. Management believes this is useful to investors as an indicator of Marathon's commitment to capital expenditure discipline by eliminating differences caused by the timing of capital accrual and other items. Capital expenditures (accrued) should not be considered in isolation or as an alternative to, or more meaningful than, cash additions to property, plant and equipment as determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP.Our presentation of reinvestment rate is a non-GAAP measure. The reinvestment rate in the context of adjusted free cash flow is defined as capital expenditures (accrued) divided by adjusted CFO. The reinvestment rate in the context of free cash flow is defined as cash additions to property, plant and equipment divided by net cash provided by operating activities. Management believes the reinvestment rate is useful to investors to demonstrate the Company's commitment to generating cash for use towards investor-friendly purposes (which includes balance sheet enhancement, base dividend and other return of capital).These non-GAAP financial measures reflect an additional way of viewing aspects of the business that, when viewed with GAAP results may provide a more complete understanding of factors and trends affecting the business and are a useful tool to help management and investors make informed decisions about Marathon Oil's financial and operating performance. These measures should not be considered in isolation or as an alternative to their most directly comparable GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation to their most directly comparable GAAP financial measures can be found in our investor package on our website at https://ir.marathonoil.com/ and in the tables below.

There are plenty of uncertainties to consider, from central bank-related macro concerns to geopolitical issues and a slowing global economy. What this portends for energy stocks in particular is going to be difficult to ascertain.That said, I think there’s good reason for investors to consider adding some exposure to energy stocks right now. This is a sector that’s given back much of its gains from last year. However, many of the same catalysts that drove energy stocks higher remain in play.Thus, for those looking to hedge against market uncertainty this year, the three energy stocks below are among the best in the sector with regard to fundamental strength, industry outlook and financial position.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsMROMarathon Oil$27.75OXYOccidental Petroleum$65.63XOMExxon Mobil$119.17Marathon Oil (MRO)Marathon Oil Logo at the top of a mobile device.Source: IgorGolovniov / Shutterstock.comMarathon Oil (NYSE:MRO) is one of North America’s leading oil and gas exploration and production companies.

Analysts are calling for EPS of 85 cents, a 10.4% increase over the year-ago quarter. However, I think the company could exceed analysts’ earnings expectations, as it has done in each of the past four quarters. If it does, the stock could see bullish momentum pick up.For the full year, analysts are forecasting a 44% jump in revenue and for earnings to nearly triple to $4.57 per share. Revenue is expected to decline in 2023, though only by 0.5%, while earnings are estimated to contract by 18.6%.Story continuesHowever, the company recently disclosed that it had successfully completed the acquisition of Ensign Natural Resources’ Eagle Ford assets for a total cash consideration of $3 billion.

(OXY) on screen in front of website. Focus on phone display. Unmodified photo.Source: T. Schneider / Shutterstock.comOccidental Petroleum (NYSE:OXY) is another major player in the oil and gas production and exploration space and a favorite of Warren Buffett.The stock is up 4.2% so far this year, less than the 6.5% gain in the S&amp;P 500. But shares surged 119% in 2022, no doubt helped by the clout of the world’s best-known investor throwing his weight behind the company. In July, Berkshire gained the approval of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to buy up to 50% of the oil company’s common stock. Currently, Berkshire owns more than 194 million OXY shares for a 21.4% stake worth approximately $12.8 billion.Occidental is expected to report fourth-quarter and full-year results at the end of the month. For 2022, analysts are predicting revenue will increase by 41% to $37.2 billion. Earnings per share are estimated to surge 280% to $9.69. As these forecasts show, the company benefited greatly from last year’s elevated energy prices. And while analysts are predicting revenue and earnings will decline this year, Occidental is still expected to earn $6.84 a share on $33.3 billion in revenue.Analysts’ average 12-month target price of $75.36 is 15% above where shares currently trade. That’s not as impressive as the 53% return over the past 12 months. However, with Buffett in the company’s corner, more upside may be in the cards.Exxon Mobil (XOM)XOM Stock Is on the Way Back, but It Will Take Some TimeSource: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.comShares of Houston-based Exxon Mobil (NYSE:XOM) are up 8% so far in 2023, marking the best year-to-date performance among today’s top energy stocks.  Over the past year, XOM has gained 53%.In addition to producing, transporting and selling petroleum products, Exxon is involved in manufacturing synthetic rubber, plastics and other items that will remain in high demand regardless of short-term oil price fluctuations. Moreover, its control over the entire value chain enables Exxon to retain a larger share of the profits it generates than many of its competitors.On Jan. 31, the company reported a record $56 billion in net profits for 2022. As news organizations were quick to point out, that translates to $6.3 million an hour, or more than $100,000 a minute.While revenue and earnings are projected to decline this year on lower oil prices,  I think the company will continue to deliver for investors due to its vertically integrated business model and the recent progress with the $8 billion Coral South floating liquified natural gas project in Mozambique. Exxon said the project produced its first LNG cargo in November. While XOM may not deliver gains as large as the other energy stocks on this list, it is an excellent option for long-term investors. In addition to producing long-term capital gains, the company pays an attractive dividend for a 3.1% yield. Exxon has raised that dividend in each of the past 40 years.On the date of publication, Chris MacDonald did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.Chris MacDonald’s love for investing led him to pursue an MBA in Finance and take on a number of management roles in corporate finance and venture capital over the past 15 years.

Microsoft is now expanding this program to all 50 states via a new TechSpark Fellows model.Microsoft company logo. (PRNewsFoto/Microsoft Corp.) (PRNewsfoto/Microsoft Corp.)The expansion beyond eight existing locations to communities across the United States means Microsoft will supply a grant to support a TechSpark fellow, along with hands-on mentorship and training. The program will remain hyperlocal and partner-driven with a focus on four key issues:Digital access – building broadband infrastructure so people have access to essential online activities.Computer science education – helping build computer science classes in local schools.Digital skills – helping people learn the skills they need for the jobs of the future.Digital transformation – helping nonprofits, startups and local businesses leverage technology to grow, innovate and compete.Microsoft is also releasing a playbook and a resource hub to replicate and build on approaches learned thus far, designed for anyone looking to drive change in their community and help bolster the local economy.Communities across America are facing significant headwinds, especially in this economic environment. The Brookings Institution notes that ""digitalization divides across and within places now stand as one of the nation's starkest limits on opportunity.""

Get the Morning Brief sent directly to your inbox every Monday to Friday by 6:30 a.m. ET. SubscribeThursday, February 16, 2023Today's newsletter is by Jared Blikre, a reporter focused on the markets on Yahoo Finance. Follow him on Twitter @SPYJared. Read this and more market news on the go with the Yahoo Finance App.The AI genie has escaped the bottle with a velocity not matched in modern human history, and investors are starting to take notice. Wednesday, C3.ai (AI) and SoundHound AI (SOUN) added to their 2023 gains — each up about 120% this year.Despite the outperformance of these thematic AI names, the industry is still relatively small, leaving many investors wondering how to invest. Already, one veteran macro trader is peering far beyond the hype, warning that investment in AI could be the ""biggest bubble of all time.""Raoul Pal, the CEO and founder of Real Vision Group, recently spoke to Yahoo Finance Uncut about the tremendous growth in artificial intelligence as well as the knock-on effects of mass adoption. He believes that the number of applications for AI is set to explode, and we are not yet ready to deal with the implications of this exponential growth.Pal argues that hand-in-hand with the growth story, AI will usher in a global deflationary shock — one of the largest the world has ever seen.""I think it might be bigger [by] orders of magnitude than China joining the [World Trade Organization]. I can't express how powerful what is happening is,"" he said, referring to the 2001 WTO decision that paved the way for China to become a manufacturing and trade juggernaut — ushering in an era of cheap imported goods for Americans.Similarly, experts forecast that AI will replace many workers while lowering the cost of goods and services for consumers.But despite the lofty visions of industry insiders and investors looking for the next big thing, the technology is still relatively young, with few investing opportunities at scale. Guardforce AI (GFAI), and BigBear.ai Holdings (BBAI) are pure-play names attracting attention. But even the largest among them — the aforementioned enterprise-software leader, C3.ai — only has a market cap of $2.5 billion.Story continuesArtificial Intelligence-themed stocks and funds attracting attention (not comprehensive)In the universe of funds, several thematic ETFs include AI — but mostly in addition to the larger robotics theme. The lone exception appears to be the WisdomTree AI and Innovation Fund (WTAI). (Though, a smartly-named ETF with the ticker CHAT recently filed for registration in the U.S.)But investors needn't chase illiquid small-cap stocks to invest in AI.""[F]or the average person, right now, the easiest two ways [to invest in AI] are Microsoft and Google,"" says Pal, adding that both companies are pivoting their entire business models to embrace AI.Microsoft (MSFT) may have an early-mover advantage with ChatGPT. But behind the scenes, Alphabet's Google (GOOGL, GOOG) has been investing in other complementary technologies, which should become major investment opportunities down the road, says Pal.""[D]on't forget — Google's got robotics. Google's got EV. Google's got self driving ... [T]hey've got quantum computing — all in their Google X Labs, which we don't even know about. It's all behind the curtain.""As users adopt these new technologies, the companies that offer them at scale should benefit from network effects — a self-reinforcing phenomenon that exponentially increases their network activity. Semiconductors also fall into this category, says Pal. Companies like Nvidia (NVDA) are key to processing AI data, and they are likely to benefit as the technology becomes more widespread.There will be more high-profile AI failures — some funny, and some scary, as the technology worms its way into our everyday lives and mission-critical systems. But the deck is stacked in favor of exponential growth.While it may seem premature to worry about a bubble in any asset when investors are still reeling front last year's drubbing, Pal focuses on some of the near-term effects. ""If there's ever a reason for the major technology stocks to really have another leg higher, it's on [AI],"" he says.

People are also using the chat-capable Bing beyond specific queries “for more general discovery of the world, and for social entertainment,” the company said.The new technology comes from Microsoft’s integration of ChatGPT-like technology from OpenAI Inc., the startup responsible for the phenomenally popular online chatbot. Microsoft, an early backer of OpenAI that recently poured in a further $10 billion into the firm and deepened its collaboration, is using a modified and upgraded version of OpenAI’s GPT language models. The chat integration is designed to give fuller answers in a more conversational setting.There is still much room for improvement, Microsoft said. For queries that require a high degree of accuracy, such as financial reports, the software giant will quadruple the grounding data it sends to the model responsible for producing answers. Microsoft also found that its chat AI struggled on longer conversations of 15 or more questions. “Bing can become repetitive or be prompted/provoked to give responses that are not necessarily helpful or in line with our designed tone,” it said.Researchers and other testers have posted some aberrant interactions with the Bing bot online, where the AI has taken a threatening or argumentative tone or disputed basic facts like the current year. Microsoft acknowledged people testing out edge-case scenarios and said those efforts are helping it refine the product.Story continues“We know we must build this in the open with the community; this can’t be done solely in the lab,” the company said.--With assistance from Dina Bass.Most Read from Bloomberg BusinessweekThe Staged Bomb Scare That Backfired on Mumbai’s Notorious CopsWith Human Metalworkers Hard to Come By, Robotic Blacksmiths Step UpZantac’s Maker Kept Quiet About Cancer Risks for 40 YearsThe World’s War Machine Is Running Low on AmmunitionSpy Balloons Are the Slow and Silent Future of Surveillance©2023 Bloomberg L.P.]"

Let's take a closer look.There are plenty of strategies for discovering value stocks, but we have found that pairing a strong Zacks Rank with an impressive grade in the Value category of our Style Scores system produces the best returns. The proven Zacks Rank emphasizes companies with positive estimate revision trends, and our Style Scores highlight stocks with specific traits.Both Cap Gemini SA and Paychex have a Zacks Rank of # 2 (Buy) right now. This means that both companies have witnessed positive earnings estimate revisions, so investors should feel comfortable knowing that both of these stocks have an improving earnings outlook. But this is just one piece of the puzzle for value investors.Value investors analyze a variety of traditional, tried-and-true metrics to help find companies that they believe are undervalued at their current share price levels.The Value category of the Style Scores system identifies undervalued companies by looking at a number of key metrics. These include the long-favored P/E ratio, P/S ratio, earnings yield, cash flow per share, and a variety of other fundamentals that help us determine a company's fair value.CGEMY currently has a forward P/E ratio of 17.49, while PAYX has a forward P/E of 26.79. We also note that CGEMY has a PEG ratio of 1.45. This figure is similar to the commonly-used P/E ratio, with the PEG ratio also factoring in a company's expected earnings growth rate. PAYX currently has a PEG ratio of 3.57.Another notable valuation metric for CGEMY is its P/B ratio of 3.43. The P/B ratio pits a stock's market value against its book value, which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities.

Winners demonstrate peak performance in employee training and development and organizational success.The training programs recognized as part of the company's overall successful learning and development program included the following: The Paychex Well-being Program: To support employee health and well-being, the Paychex training team developed a program that addressed environmental and cultural factors that influence the five dimensions of well-being: physical, emotional, financial, career, and community. The program included more than 80 company-wide Well-being Champions to support and coach, interactive activities, self-led resources, external seminars, internal events, and community service opportunities. As a result, an increase in the number of Paychex employees surveyed shared that the organization cared about their health and well-being from the previous year. Paychex also experienced a year-over-year decrease in the absence timeframe for the duration of short-term disability leave.The Strategic Consultant Academy: This six-week hybrid program was developed for new Client Advocates and Relationship Managers for the Paychex Professional Employer Organization (PEO) as an experiential learning program that combined a multitude of self-study learning resources, virtual instructor-led touchpoints, and shadowing with an assigned mentor. The goal was to drive consultative and strategic relationships with PEO clients to help grow their businesses—something measured by worksite employee growth. This program, in addition to other strategies, resulted in an increase in year-over-year growth of worksite employees with PEO clients.Refreshed New Hire Learning Program Content: This strategic initiative focused on the curation of the modules of the company's 20+ new hire training programs. 69 individual modules were reviewed and vetted for accuracy and relevancy and repurposed into four new eLearning modules called PAYX101: Paychex Foundations. The series was designed for any Paychex employee, regardless of role and averaged a review rating of 4.5 out of 5 from new employees that completed the program.Story continuesThe company is also committed to helping business owners succeed with employee training and development, offering a cloud-based learning management system (LMS) called Paychex Learning Essential and Paychex Learning Enhanced. With the two Paychex LMS options, employers can choose the training material they want to provide and make it available to workers when and where they need it. The tool includes on-demand training courses for onsite and remote employees, training course libraries that meet the demands of any workplace, and agile courses through Paychex Flex®.The complete Training APEX Awards list is available in the March issue of Training magazine and on trainingmag.com.About Paychex Paychex, Inc.

Bernie Sanders.“Apparently, it is easier for Mr. Schultz to fire workers who are exercising their constitutional right to form unions and to intimidate others who may be interested in joining a union than to answer questions from elected officials,” Sanders, a Vermont Independent, said Wednesday in a statement.The Vermont Independent sent a letter to Schultz earlier this month asking him to appear March 9 for a hearing about the unionization campaign and Starbucks' “compliance with federal labor law.” The letter was signed by the committee’s 10 Democrats.At least 286 company-owned U.S. Starbucks stores have voted to unionize since late 2021. Starbucks doesn’t support the effort, and the process has been contentious. Regional officers for the National Labor Relations Board have filed 76 complaints against the company for various issues, including failure to bargain. Starbucks, meanwhile, has filed 86 unfair labor practice charges against the union, Starbucks Workers United.In its own letter sent to the committee on Tuesday, Starbucks noted that Schultz __ a longtime Starbucks CEO who came out of retirement last year to assume the interim CEO job __ will be transitioning out of that role at the end of March. Laxman Narasimhan, a former PepsiCo executive, will become Starbucks’ new CEO on April 1. Schultz will remain on the company’s board.Seattle-based Starbucks said AJ Jones II, Starbucks’ chief public affairs officer, would be better suited to discussing the unionization campaign since he has been more closely involved. The company also said it has been bargaining to reach a contract agreement at more than 200 stores that have voted to unionize.It’s unclear how the committee will proceed. In his statement Wednesday, Sanders said he intended to “hold Mr. Schultz and Starbucks accountable for their unacceptable behavior and look forward to seeing him before our committee.”The committee has the power to subpoena Schultz, but it’s not yet clear if it will use it. A message seeking comment was emailed to a committee spokesman Wednesday.]"

80,a03a5f05-20bf-3980-9df8-24934d1279a9,PH,2023-02-16,10 Jim Cramer Stocks This Month,Insider Monkey,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/10-jim-cramer-stocks-month-153608655.html,1676475368,STORY,"['EME', 'DIS', 'PH', 'SNOW', 'COP']","[In this article, we will take a look at the 10 Jim Cramer stocks this month. To see more such companies, go directly to 5 Jim Cramer Stocks This Month.Jim Cramer on January 31 announced that we are in a bull market so investors should buy the dip. Cramer’s comments were validated on the back of the huge optimism that prevailed after the Federal Reserve indicated that its rate hikes were working. Fed chair Jerome Powell at the start of February said that it could be said for the “first time” that the ""disinflationary process” has started. These comments gave a huge boost to the market. Tech stocks and cryptocurrencies also rallied. However, a stronger-than-expected jobs report for January dashed this optimism as analysts agreed that the stubborn growth in the labor market will affect the Federal Reserve’s decision making process when it comes to rate hikes.Jim Cramer’s stance is also showing signs of caution. Cramer recently said that people should not ignore investing fundamentals even during a bull market.“I just want you to have a real earnings cushion with real buybacks or real dividends — ideally both — and I can’t feel comfortable recommending anything without them,” Cramer said, during his “Mad Money” program on CNBC.""Back to Basics""Moving beyond the debate of whether we are in a bull market or bear market, the fact remains that long-term investors almost always see market downturns as investing opportunities. A JPMorgan report on the outlook and assumptions for the stock market in 2023 says that lower valuations and higher yields mean that asset markets today offer the best long-term returns in more than a decade. The report said that the stock market turmoil of 2022 might have created “investment opportunities in the years ahead.”JPMorgan’s report theme and title was “back to basics” which highlights the importance of age-old, time-tested investing principles which still “hold firm” according to the investment firm. The report said that the 60/40 portfolio can form the bedrock of portfolios, while alternatives can offer alpha, inflation protection and diversification.Story continuesJPMorgan said that despite the geopolitical headwinds and recession fears, its estimates for global growth over the next decade or so are unchanged at 2.20%. The firm said that the headwinds that battered the market are expected to spill over into 2023, providing opportunity for investors who are looking for attractive entry points.“With policy rates likely to rise further over the next year, investors will also be penalized less for opportunistically holding some cash in the short term in order to take advantage of any further dislocations in asset markets.” Our MethodologyFor this article, we went through Jim Cramer’s Mad Money episodes aired in February through February 10 on CNBC and picked the most notable stocks the journalist and investor is bullish on. Most of these stocks have long-term fundamentals according to Cramer. That’s why these stocks are decent picks for not only this month but for the long-term as well.Jim Cramer Stocks This Month10. EMCOR Group, Inc. (NYSE:EME)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 27EMCOR Group, Inc. (NYSE:EME) is a Connecticut-based engineering and construction company. EMCOR Group, Inc. (NYSE:EME) has weathered the market storm of 2022 as it has been up about 25% over the past twelve months as of February 10.During a “lightning round” on his recent program, Jim Cramer said that EMCOR Group Inc (EME) was “my kind of stock.” He further said the following about the company:“That’s exactly what I’m looking for.”EMCOR Group, Inc. (NYSE:EME) is one of the safer plays in the market. EMCOR Group, Inc. (NYSE:EME) also pays dividends. In January, EMCOR Group, Inc. (NYSE:EME) declared a dividend of $0.15 per share. In October 2022, when companies were struggling amid the market turmoil, EMCOR Group, Inc. (NYSE:EME) announced a 15% dividend hike for its shareholders.As of the end of the third quarter of 2022, 27 hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey reported owning shares in EMCOR Group, Inc. (NYSE:EME).TimesSquare Capital made the following comment about EMCOR Group, Inc. (NYSE:EME) in its Q3 2022 investor letter:“Offsetting that somewhat was the 12% return posted by EMCOR Group, Inc. (NYSE:EME), which provides construction and operational services for mechanical and electrical systems to a broad range of commercial, industrial, utility, and institutional customers. As an industrial company well-positioned to pass along higher costs and maintaining its margins, EMCOR reported higher-than-anticipated revenues and earnings, increased guidance for the balance of the year, and authorized an additional $500 million share repurchase plan. There was a healthy backlog of orders for refinery services, building retrofits, construction, and advanced industrial areas.”9. The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 112The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS) has been all over the news lately amid the company’s restructuring plans and its fight with a hedge fund. Jim Cramer recently praised The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS) CEO Bob Iger’s restructuring and cost-cutting plan. Cramer said during his recent program that it seems like The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS) is “back on track.” So far in 2023, The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS) is up over 24% through February 10. Cramer said that while The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS) has gained a lot in 2023, he believes it has more upside potential now that the CEO is turning things around.Several factors are helping The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS) stock. The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS) recently posted strong quarterly results and announced to cut about 7,000 jobs. The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS) also aims to restore its dividend this year. In another news, Nelson Peltz of Trian Partners has indicated that his proxy fight with The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS) is over following the company’s announcement of a restructuring plan.Madison Funds made the following comment about The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS) in its fourth-quarter 2022 investor letter:“The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS) reported a disappointing fourth quarter with revenue and earnings below consensus which was followed by the board replacing then-CEO Bob Chapek and the return of Bob Iger as CEO. Parks remained a bright spot while losses at direct-to-consumer increased and linear networks continued to be challenged by cord cutting.”8. Parker-Hannifin Corporation (NYSE:PH)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 45Parker-Hannifin Corporation (NYSE:PH) ranks 8th in our list of the Jim Cramer stocks to watch this month. Earlier this month, Jim Cramer said that Parker-Hannifin Corporation (NYSE:PH) is “just the kind of industrial” he’s been recommending.“I would buy it here,” announced Cramer.Parker-Hannifin Corporation (NYSE:PH) is another defensive play Jim Cramer has been picking during the current environment.As of the end of the third quarter of 2022, 45 hedge funds reported owning stakes in Parker-Hannifin Corporation (NYSE:PH), according to Insider Monkey’s database of 920 hedge funds’ holdings. This was up from 35 hedge funds that had stakes in Parker-Hannifin Corporation (NYSE:PH) in the previous quarter. This shows that the hedge fund sentiment around Parker-Hannifin Corporation (NYSE:PH) is positive.Here is what Stewart Asset Management has to say about Parker-Hannifin Corporation (NYSE:PH) in its Q3 2022 investor letter:“”We also need to point out one global consequence of the rapid rise in interest rates: an irrepressibly strong dollar. This hurts the reported earnings of U.S. companies who sell their goods and services overseas. Foreign currency earnings translate into fewer dollars and thus lower earnings. Most of the companies in your portfolios gain a notable amount of earnings from their international operations. While the strength or weakness of a currency doesn’t change the quality of a business or its longer-term earnings power, it can change the reported earnings of a company over short periods of time. It is difficult to forecast this effect accurately because many of our companies manufacture where they sell, which to some extent dulls the sharp negative effect of a surging dollar. Others sell goods that are priced in dollars such as Parker-Hannifin’s (NYSE:PH) aerospace products.7. ConocoPhillips (NYSE:COP)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 64Another defensive safe play Jim Cramer is recommending to his fans is ConocoPhillips (NYSE:COP). Jim Cramer recently said the following about the oil company during one of his recent programs:“That thing is like a fine Merlot, my friend. I would buy all you can right here.”ConocoPhillips (NYSE:COP) is another oil stock that pays strong dividends. ConocoPhillips (NYSE:COP) is also popular among smart money. Insider Monkey’s database of 920 hedge funds shows that 64 hedge funds had stakes in ConocoPhillips (NYSE:COP) at the end of the third quarter of 2022. The total value of these stakes was about $2.7 billion.ClearBridge Investments made the following comment about ConocoPhillips (NYSE:COP) in its Q3 2022 investor letter:“ConocoPhillips (NYSE:COP) handily outperformed the energy sector, which led the value benchmark. Its exposure to natural gas helped the stock perform more in line with natural gas E&amp;Ps, which led the sector due to the European energy crisis and U.S. shale gas being considered a secure long-term source of liquid natural gas. In addition to COP’s low-cost resource base, conservative balance sheet and experienced management team, we appreciate its strong focus on ESG measures, which we believe is a good indicator of the quality of a company’s business model and management team.Specifically, we appreciate solid governance practices with compensation metrics emphasizing ROCE and relative total shareholder return, the board’s effective oversight of management as well as the company’s methane flaring leadership. COP is investing in field electrification and carbon capture across its portfolio, with ambitions to deliver oil production with a CO2 intensity of sub-5 kg/BOE, which would be one of the lowest emission sources of supply in the world.”6. Snowflake Inc. (NYSE:SNOW)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 73Snowflake Inc. (NYSE:SNOW) investors have been cheering the stock’s rally in 2023. The Cloud company’s stock has gained about 20% so far in 2023 through February 10. Jim Cramer also likes Snowflake Inc. (NYSE:SNOW). Cramer expressed confidence in Snowflake Inc. (NYSE:SNOW)’s CEO Frank Slootman and said:“I like Snowflake. I will go with Slootman. He is a money maker.”In January, Snowflake Inc. (NYSE:SNOW) shares jumped after Canaccord Genuity said the company is well-positioned to benefit from the consolidation in the database and data warehousing markets. The firm set a price target of $195 for Snowflake stock.As of the end of the third quarter of last year, 73 hedge funds reported owning stakes in Snowflake Inc. (NYSE:SNOW), up from 66 funds in the previous quarter. This shows that hedge funds were piling into Snowflake Inc. (NYSE:SNOW) despite a massive rotation away from tech towards value during last year. Click to continue reading and see 5 Jim Cramer Stocks This Month. Suggested articles:25 Countries with the Most Billionaires11 Best CBD Stocks To Buy Now25 Fastest Cars in the WorldDisclosure: None. 10 Jim Cramer Stocks This Month is originally published on Insider Monkey.]"

GAAP to Non-GAAP ReconciliationSynopsys continues to provide all information required in accordance with GAAP, but acknowledges evaluating its ongoing operating results may not be as useful if an investor is limited to reviewing only GAAP financial measures. Accordingly, Synopsys presents non-GAAP financial measures in reporting its financial results to provide investors with an additional tool to evaluate Synopsys' operating results in a manner that focuses on what Synopsys believes to be its core business operations and what Synopsys uses to evaluate its business operations and for internal planning and forecasting purposes. These non-GAAP measures may be different from non-GAAP measures used by other companies.  Synopsys' management does not itself, nor does it suggest that investors should, consider such non-GAAP financial measures in isolation from, superior to, or as a substitute for, financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP. Synopsys' management believes it is useful for itself and investors to review, as applicable, both GAAP financial measures that include: (i) the amortization of acquired intangible assets, (ii) the impact of stock compensation, (iii) acquisition-related items, (iv) restructuring charges, (v) the effects of certain settlements, final judgments and loss contingencies related to legal proceedings, and (vi) the income tax effect of non-GAAP pre-tax adjustments; and the non-GAAP financial measures that exclude such information in order to assess the performance of Synopsys' business operations and for planning and forecasting in subsequent periods.Synopsys' annual non-GAAP tax rate was 18% for fiscal year 2022, and it previously elected to maintain an annual non-GAAP tax rate of 18% for fiscal year 2023 given uncertainty surrounding further U.S. corporate tax law changes. This annual non-GAAP tax rate was based on an evaluation of Synopsys' historical and projected mix of U.S. and international profit before tax, taking into account the impact of non-GAAP adjustments, U.S. tax law changes, as well as other factors such as its current tax structure, existing tax positions and expected recurring tax incentives.Based on a re-evaluation of federal tax laws that require research and development expense to be capitalized commencing in Synopsys' first quarter of fiscal year 2023, Synopsys has elected to update its annual non-GAAP tax rate for fiscal year 2023 to 16%. Synopsys does not currently anticipate any additional significant changes to U.S. corporate tax law, its geographic earnings mix, or significant tax law changes in major jurisdictions where it operates that would result in further adjustment to its fiscal year 2023 annual non-GAAP tax rate.When possible, Synopsys provides a reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measure to the most closely applicable GAAP financial measure. Investors are encouraged to review the related GAAP financial measures and the reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to their most directly comparable GAAP financial measure as detailed below, as well as Item 2.02 of Synopsys' Current Report on Form 8-K filed on February 15, 2023, for additional information about the measures Synopsys uses to evaluate its core business operations. Synopsys is unable to provide a reconciliation of certain non-GAAP guidance measures to the corresponding GAAP measures on a forward-looking basis because doing so would not be possible without unreasonable effort due to, among other things, the potential variability and limited visibility of the excluded items. For the same reasons, Synopsys is unable to address the probable significance of the unavailable information.

86,721089ea-7d64-3f6d-a13d-edc332b649a7,HST,2023-02-16,Host Hotels (HST) Q4 FFO and Revenues Beat Estimates,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/host-hotels-hst-q4-ffo-225510710.html,1676501710,STORY,['HST'],"[Host Hotels (HST) came out with quarterly funds from operations (FFO) of $0.44 per share, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $0.43 per share. This compares to FFO of $0.29 per share a year ago. These figures are adjusted for non-recurring items.This quarterly report represents an FFO surprise of 2.33%. A quarter ago, it was expected that this lodging real estate investment trust would post FFO of $0.39 per share when it actually produced FFO of $0.38, delivering a surprise of -2.56%.Over the last four quarters, the company has surpassed consensus FFO estimates three times.Host Hotels , which belongs to the Zacks REIT and Equity Trust - Other industry, posted revenues of $1.26 billion for the quarter ended December 2022, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 1.24%. This compares to year-ago revenues of $998 million. The company has topped consensus revenue estimates four times over the last four quarters.The sustainability of the stock's immediate price movement based on the recently-released numbers and future FFO expectations will mostly depend on management's commentary on the earnings call.Host Hotels shares have added about 15.5% since the beginning of the year versus the S&amp;P 500's gain of 7.7%.What's Next for Host Hotels?While Host Hotels has outperformed the market so far this year, the question that comes to investors' minds is: what's next for the stock?There are no easy answers to this key question, but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company's FFO outlook. Not only does this include current consensus FFO expectations for the coming quarter(s), but also how these expectations have changed lately.Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near-term stock movements and trends in estimate revisions. Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried-and-tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank, which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of estimate revisions.Story continuesAhead of this earnings release, the estimate revisions trend for Host Hotels: mixed. While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company's just-released earnings report, the current status translates into a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for the stock. So, the shares are expected to perform in line with the market in the near future. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.It will be interesting to see how estimates for the coming quarters and current fiscal year change in the days ahead. The current consensus FFO estimate is $0.46 on $1.28 billion in revenues for the coming quarter and $1.86 on $5.14 billion in revenues for the current fiscal year.Investors should be mindful of the fact that the outlook for the industry can have a material impact on the performance of the stock as well. In terms of the Zacks Industry Rank, REIT and Equity Trust - Other is currently in the bottom 25% of the 250 plus Zacks industries.

Risoleo, President and Chief Executive Officer, said, “We ended 2022 with strong operating improvements, driven by continued rate strength across our portfolio. In the fourth quarter, our RevPAR was $197, representing a 0.6% increase over the fourth quarter of 2019. Our results this quarter were driven by rate increases of 15.6% compared to the same period in 2019, despite the macroeconomic uncertainty.”Risoleo continued, “Over the course of the year, we continued to successfully allocate capital through acquisitions, dispositions, and reinvestment in our portfolio. We made additional progress on our three key strategic objectives, which include redefining the operating model, gaining market share through comprehensive renovations, and strategically allocating capital to development ROI projects. We reinstated and twice increased our quarterly dividend, bringing the total dividends declared for the year to $0.53 per share. Subsequent to year end, we amended and restated our existing $2.5 billion credit facility to further enhance the strength and flexibility of our balance sheet. We are optimistic about the future of travel, and believe we are very well positioned to continue to improve the quality and EBITDA growth profile of our portfolio.”2022 HIGHLIGHTS:All Owned Hotel Total RevPAR was $320.39 and All Owned Hotel RevPAR was $196.33 for full year 2022, with each of the second, third and fourth quarters exceeding 2019 results in the respective quarters.

Also opened the brand-new 2.3-acre River Falls Water Park and the 60,000 square-foot meeting space expansion at the Orlando World Center Marriott, with the projects completed ahead of schedule and under budget.Repaid the $683 million outstanding on the revolver portion of the Company's credit facility.Reinstated and twice increased the quarterly dividend, resulting in total dividends declared in 2022 of $0.53 per common share, including a $0.20 per share special dividend.Introduced the Company's 2050 vision of becoming a net positive company, in conjunction with the issuance of its 2022 Corporate Responsibility Report.Results for Fourth Quarter 2022All Owned Hotel Total RevPAR was $325.88 and All Owned Hotel RevPAR was $196.82 in the fourth quarter, a 0.1% and 0.6% increase, respectively, over the fourth quarter of 2019. Average room rates were 15.6% above fourth quarter 2019, driven by continued strong leisure demand, while also benefiting from growth in urban markets. Fourth quarter and full year operations were affected by Hurricane Ian and the resulting closure of two properties, as discussed in detail below.Generated GAAP net income of $149 million in the fourth quarter and GAAP operating profit margin of 14.0%, an improvement of 160 basis points compared to the fourth quarter of 2019.Achieved All Owned Hotel EBITDA of $373 million and Adjusted EBITDAre of $364 million, both of which exceeded 2019 fourth quarter results.The strong improvement in rate but more normalized staffing levels led to All Owned Hotel EBITDA margin of 29.5% for the fourth quarter, exceeding the fourth quarter 2019 margin by 110 basis points. Food and beverage results benefited from continued strong contributions from group business to Banquet and Catering revenues.Subsequent EventsOn January 4, 2023, the Company amended and restated its $2.5 billion credit facility, extending the maturities and maintaining similar terms to the prior agreement. The amended facility reflects no increase in pricing and bears interest pursuant to a credit ratings-based grid ranging from 0.725% to 1.600% over the applicable adjusted term SOFR and adds pricing incentives linked to portfolio sustainability initiatives.January Comparable hotel RevPAR is estimated to be $184.HURRICANE IAN UPDATEAs previously discussed, Hurricane Ian caused significant damage at The Ritz-Carlton, Naples and Hyatt Regency Coconut Point Resort and Spa. The Hyatt Regency Coconut Point remained open to first responders and reopened to guests on November 7, 2022, as part of a phased reopening. The pool facilities reopening is currently in progress and targeted for completion by June 2023. The Ritz-Carlton, Naples remains closed, and the Company is targeting a phased reopening strategy beginning in summer 2023. The Company is still evaluating the complete property and business interruption impacts of the storm, but currently estimates the total property damage and remediation costs resulting from the storm to be approximately $200 million to $220 million, across all of the affected Florida properties. The Company is insured for $325 million per named windstorm, with a $15 million deductible, resulting in potential insurance recovery of approximately $310 million for covered costs. Provided planned reopening dates can be maintained, the Company believes this coverage should be sufficient to cover substantially all of the property remediation and reconstruction costs and the near-term loss of business. However, it is possible that the insurance coverage may not be sufficient to cover the entirety of the business interruption caused by the storm. As of February 15, 2023, the Company has received approximately $50 million of insurance proceeds related to these claims.The Company estimates that Hurricane Ian negatively impacted its full year revenues by approximately $39 million, of which $33 million was in the fourth quarter, All Owned Hotel RevPAR by 60 basis points, with a 220 basis points impact in the fourth quarter, and net income and Adjusted EBITDAre by $18 million, of which $15 million was in the fourth quarter. The impact also reduced full year operating profit margin under GAAP by an estimated 20 basis points, with an 80 basis points impact in the fourth quarter, and All Owned Hotel EBITDA margin by 10 basis points, with a 40 basis points impact in the fourth quarter.BALANCE SHEETThe Company maintains a robust balance sheet, with the following balances at December 31, 2022:Total assets of $12.3 billion.Debt balance of $4.2 billion, with an average maturity of 5.2 years, an average interest rate of 4.4%, and no significant maturities until April 2024, after taking into account the amended credit facility agreement completed January 4, 2023.Total available liquidity of approximately $2.4 billion, including furniture, fixtures and equipment escrow reserves of $200 million and $1.5 billion available under the revolver portion of the credit facility.SHARE REPURCHASE PROGRAM AND DIVIDENDSDuring the fourth quarter, the Company repurchased 1.7 million shares at an average price of $15.93 per share through its common share repurchase program for a total of $27 million. The Company has approximately $973 million of remaining capacity under the repurchase program, wherein the common stock may be purchased from time to time, depending upon market conditions.The Company paid a fourth quarter cash dividend of $0.32 per share on its common stock on January 17, 2023 to stockholders of record on December 30, 2022, which included a $0.20 per share special dividend. On February 15, 2023, the Company announced a regular quarterly cash dividend of $0.12 per share on its common stock. The dividend will be paid on April 17, 2023 to stockholders of record on March 31, 2023. All future dividends, including any special dividends, are subject to approval by the Company’s Board of Directors.HOTEL BUSINESS MIX UPDATE The Company’s customers fall into three broad groups: transient, group and contract business, which accounted for approximately 65%, 32%, and 3% respectively, of its 2022 room sales, similar to the mix in 2019.Leisure demand continued to contribute to improvements in the fourth quarter compared to 2019, while group maintained strong rate increases compared to the fourth quarter of 2019. The following are the results for transient, group and contract business in comparison to 2019 performance, for the Company's current portfolio:  Quarter ended December 31, 2022  Year ended December 31, 2022   Transient  Group  Contract  Transient  Group  Contract Room nights (in thousands)  1,448   954   153   5,870   3,751   564 Percentage change in room nights vs. same period in 2019  (17.6)%  (7.8)%  33.8%  (16.3)%  (15.8)%  16.1%Rooms Revenues (in millions) $488  $247  $30  $1,967  $957  $106 Percentage change in revenues vs. same period in 2019  0.6%  1.7%  21.2%  2.8%  (10.6)%  4.7%                         Capital Expenditures The following presents the Company’s capital expenditures spend for 2022 and the forecast for 2023 (in millions):  Year endedDecember 31, 2022  2023 Full Year Forecast             Actual  Low-end of range  High-end of range ROI - Marriott Transformational Capital Program $88  $25  $35 All other return on investment (""ROI"") projects  219   225   265 Total ROI Projects  307   250   300 Renewals and Replacements (""R&amp;R"")  185   250   300 R&amp;R and ROI Capital expenditures  492   500   600 R&amp;R - Insurable Reconstruction  12   100   125 Total Capital Expenditures $504  $600  $725              The Company invested heavily in capital expenditures in the early phases of the recovery in order to minimize future disruption and believes these renovations will continue to position these hotels to capture additional revenue. The Company received $2 million of operating profit guarantees in the fourth quarter and $10 million for full year 2022 under the Marriott Transformational Capital Program. The Company expects to receive $2 million of operating guarantees in the first half of 2023. The projects at the final two properties, Marriott Marquis San Diego Marina and Washington Marriott at Metro Center, are expected to complete in the first half of 2023. Additionally, the 2023 forecast for capital expenditures includes $100 million to $125 million for hurricane restoration work.2023 OUTLOOKCurrent macroeconomic headwinds and concerns surrounding the potential for an economic slowdown are competing with a lodging recovery. Further improvement in operations will be dependent on the ability to maintain high-rated business in resort markets, as well as the continued improvement of group, business transient and international inbound travel. There is significant uncertainty related to broader macroeconomic trends in the second half of 2023, which is reflected in the wider range included in the guidance provided below.The full year forecast is bolstered by first quarter RevPAR growth which is anticipated to be between 24% and 27%, as a result of benefiting from easier comparisons due to the impact of the Omicron variant on first quarter 2022 operations. For the remaining three quarters, the Company expects year-over-year RevPAR percentage changes to be:Down low-single digits at the low end of the guidance range; toUp low-single digits at the high end of the range.Additionally, margins are expected to decline in comparison to 2022 driven by wage inflation, closer to stable staffing levels, higher insurance and utility expenses, lower attrition and cancelation fees, and occupancy below 2019 levels.For periods starting on or after January 1, 2023, the Company will cease presentation of All Owned Hotel results and return to a comparable hotel presentation for its hotel level results. Please see Notes to Financial Information for a full description of how the comparable hotel set is determined. Management believes this will provide investors with a better understanding of underlying growth trends for the Company’s current portfolio, without impact from properties that experienced closures lasting one month or longer due to renovations or property damage sustained. The Company has removed Hyatt Regency Coconut Point Resort and Spa and The Ritz-Carlton, Naples from its comparable operations in its full year 2023 forecast due to closures caused by Hurricane Ian.As a result, the Company anticipates its 2023 operating results as compared to 2022 will be in the following range: Full Year 2023 Guidance Low-end of range  High-end of range  Change vs. 2022Comparable Hotel Total RevPAR$322  $341  1.2% to 7.2%Comparable Hotel RevPAR 199   211  2.0% to 8.0%Total revenues under GAAP 4,977   5,265  1.4% to 7.3%Operating profit margin under GAAP 12.1%  14.5% (370) bps to (130) bpsComparable Hotel EBITDA margin 28.2%  29.7% (360) bps to (210) bps          Based upon the above parameters, the Company estimates its 2023 guidance as follows: Full Year 2023 Guidance  Low-end of range  High-end of range Net income (in millions)$489  $652 Adjusted EBITDAre(in millions) 1,380   1,545 Diluted earnings per common share 0.67   0.90 NAREIT FFO per diluted share 1.60   1.82 Adjusted FFO per diluted share 1.60   1.83         See the 2023 Forecast Schedules and the Notes to Financial Information for items that may affect forecast results.ABOUT HOST HOTELS &amp; RESORTSHost Hotels &amp; Resorts, Inc. is an S&amp;P 500 company and is the largest lodging real estate investment trust and one of the largest owners of luxury and upper-upscale hotels.

The company’s current product portfolio primarily consists of cigarettes and smoke-free products. Since 2008, PMI has invested more than USD 10.5 billion to develop, scientifically substantiate and commercialize innovative smoke-free products for adults who would otherwise continue to smoke, with the goal of completely ending the sale of cigarettes. This includes the building of world-class scientific assessment capabilities, notably in the areas of pre-clinical systems toxicology, clinical and behavioral research, as well as post-market studies. In November 2022, PMI acquired Swedish Match – a leader in oral nicotine delivery – creating a global smoke-free champion led by the companies’ IQOS and ZYN brands. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has authorized versions of PMI’s IQOS Platform 1 devices and consumables and Swedish Match’s General snus as Modified Risk Tobacco Products (MRTPs). As of December 31, 2022, PMI's smoke-free products were available for sale in 73 markets, and PMI estimates that approximately 17.8 million adults around the world had already switched to IQOS and stopped smoking. Smoke-free products accounted for approximately 32% of PMI’s total full-year 2022 net revenues. With a strong foundation and significant expertise in life sciences, PMI announced in February 2021 its ambition to expand into wellness and healthcare areas and, through its Vectura Fertin Pharma subsidiary, aims to enhance life through the delivery of seamless health experiences.

Bain said last month its intention would be to retain a significant stake if an IPO went ahead.The IPO will be a test for Australia's financial market and the aviation sector, which has improved substantially since then state and international borders reopened after long closures during the pandemic.Virgin had reported seven consecutive annual losses even before COVID-19 decimated travel globally.Qantas is poised to post a first-half underlying profit of A$1.35 billion to A$1.45 billion on Feb. 23, a sharp turnaround from the prior year's underlying loss before tax of A$1.28 billion.

If you want to see more most profitable dividend stocks, go directly to 5 Most Profitable Dividend Stocks.Dividend stocks are stocks of companies that pay dividends.Many dividend stocks pay a dividend quarterly as a way to return excess capital back to shareholders. Companies can also use stock repurchases as another way to return excess capital back to shareholders. For those you interested check out 15 Companies That Are Buying Back Their Stock.When company profits rise, many companies tend to pay slightly higher dividends. When company profits decrease, many companies also decrease or even suspend their dividends.Considering the change in tax laws for stock repurchases beginning in 2023 given the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022, dividends could be slightly more attractive. As a result, some companies might be more inclined to return slightly more capital back to shareholders through dividends than stock repurchases.Jones Day describes the effect of the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022, ""U.S. (and in certain instances, non-U.S.) corporations, whose stock is traded on an established securities market, that undertake share repurchases of more than $1 million in the aggregate per tax year, will be subject to a 1% share excise tax on the value of any share repurchase unless such share repurchase is taxed as a dividend (other exceptions and exclusions may apply).""While the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 could affect dividend payments slightly, the largest determination of how much capital companies return through dividends will still likely be how much the companies make in profits in the near term and how much excess capital management of companies think they have.If there is a possibility of an economic slowdown or even a recession in the future, many companies may not raise their dividends even if their profits increase. If the economic slowdown or recession occurs, many companies will likely cut or even suspend their dividends.Story continuesIn terms of the possibility of an economic slowdown or a recession, the probability will depend on economic developments and how much further the Federal Reserve raises interest rates.Although inflation has cooled from their 2022 highs late last year, the Federal Reserve has indicated that it will raise rates further. If the U.S. central bank raises interest rates too much, there is potential for an economic slowdown or even a recession. If that happens, demand will soften for a lot of companies and company profits could decline.Given the uncertainty, it could be a good idea for long term investors to own a well diversified portfolio of leading stocks across many different sectors.Building, Real estate, HoldingMethodologyFor our list of 15 Most Profitable Dividend Stocks, we used the Fortune 500 list to find the most profitable American companies and we then filtered the list to find the stocks that paid dividends and that were profitable according to YCharts in terms of net income for the trailing twelve months.Because we used YCharts data, the net income may not be the same as adjusted profit.For some stocks, the trailing twelve months isn't the same time period as it for others given some stocks have not reported their fourth quarter earnings results yet.15 Most Profitable Dividend Stocks15.

Moreover, the burgeoning air taxi market – which should incorporate electric propulsion – may hit a sector revenue of $6.63 billion by the same forecasted period. As well, propulsion-related innovations may radically change our waterways, thus driving the case for mobility-related stocks to buy. That being said, investors should pay very close attention to transportation stocks, such as:BABoeing$212.89APTVAptiv$112.80TMToyota$143.42JOBYJody Aviation$4.20CHPTChargePoint$11.26PSNYPolestar Automotive$5.62LAZRLuminar Technologies$6.09Boeing (BA)BA stock: a blue and white Boeing 787 flying in the sky above the cloudsSource: vaalaa / ShutterstockAlthough world famous for its iconic passenger jetliners, Boeing (NYSE:BA) also eyeballs new initiatives to stay ahead of the curve. In particular, management has been aggressively competing in the air taxi arena. According to The Verge, Boeing backs air taxi startup Wisk Aero, which recently unveiled its sixth-generation aircraft.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsTwo factors stand out regarding this four-seater aircraft. First, it features an all-electric propulsion system, thus facilitating better outcomes for the environment. Second and much more impressively, the aircraft can fly without a human pilot. Now, I’m not entirely sure if that’s a great idea. But over time, we could be seeing more aircraft flying automated routes. To be sure, Boeing will require some patience among stocks to buy for the future of transportation.Following multiple controversies, it’s still struggling to regain investors’ trust. That said, Wall Street seems eager to put the past behind it. Currently, analysts peg BA as a consensus moderate buy with an implied upside target of 9%.Story continuesAptiv (APTV)Aptiv corporate location with logo against white wall.Source: AptivAn automotive technology supplier, Aptiv (NYSE:APTV) grew out of the now-defunct organization Delphi Automotive Systems. Currently, the company seeks to leverage its software and systems integration expertise to solve mobility’s toughest challenges. In particular, Aptiv focuses heavily on safety protocols for autonomous driving systems. Back in 2019, Aptiv inked a joint venture with automaker Hyundai to advance the development of production-ready autonomous driving systems for commercialization of Level 4 and 5 self-driving technologies.For full disclosure, APTV stock represents a bit of a wild ride. Since the January opener, shares gained nearly 25% of equity value. On the flipside, though, they stumbled almost 15% in the trailing year. Plus, with a price pegged at a trailing multiple of 59.49, it’s objectively overvalued. Therefore, prospective investors may want to nibble at the opportunity. Still, APTV gets a vote of confidence from Wall Street analysts, who pegged it a consensus moderate buy. Further, their average price target of $126.75, implying upside of over 9%.Toyota (TM)Toyota motor corporation logo on dealership buildingSource: josefkubes / Shutterstock.comFor investing in the here and now of the transportation sector, Toyota (NYSE:TM) makes a lot of sense. As for stocks to buy for the future of transportation, that might be a stretch at first glance. After all, the company became somewhat notorious for being a holdout regarding going all-in on EVs. Instead, Toyota insists that combustion-powered vehicles will still be relevant for years to come.Still, don’t count out Toyota for making waves in the EV market. For one thing, the automotive giant plans to offer several EV models. Moreover, it’s investing significant funds researching and developing solid-state batteries (SSBs). Given its resources and acumen, it might break the code for large-scale SSBs. If so, that in and of itself would change the game for the future of mobility. Right now, Wall Street analysts peg TM as a consensus moderate buy. In addition, their average price target stands at $161.99, implying nearly 12% upside potential.Joby Aviation (JOBY)A Joby Aviation (JOBY Stock) air taxi on display.Source: T. Schneider / Shutterstock.comStraight up, Joby Aviation (NYSE:JOBY) is a highly risky name among stocks to buy for the future of transportation. Indeed, it could make a case for the riskiest. Usually, I’d stick such ideas to the very end. However, since I’m ranking these securities based on Wall Street’s upside expectations, it’s here in fourth place.To get everyone up to speed, Joby is one of a growing number of small enterprises focusing on air taxis or aerial ride sharing. Fundamentally, Joby aims to address the massive congestion that occurs on metropolitan streets every day. Notably, the American Transportation Research Institute “estimates that congestion costs the U.S. freight sector $74.1 billion annually, $66.1 billion of which occurs in urban areas.”As well, you can consider the human toll of people wasting what amounts to a few days sitting in traffic every year. Ultimately, Joby aims to give folks back their time by advantaging the vertical component (literally) of transportation. Presently, Wall Street analysts peg JOBY as a consensus hold. However, their average price target stands at $5.25, implying over 24% upside potential.ChargePoint (CHPT)EV stocks: A close-up shot of a ChargePoint charging station.Source: YuniqueB / Shutterstock.comIf the global EV rollout is to achieve success, societies must build adequate public infrastructure networks. And that’s where ChargePoint (NYSE:CHPT) comes into the picture. Specializing in the development of EV charging stations, CHPT theoretically commands a decades-long upside narrative.To be fair, though, the market doesn’t always see eye-to-eye with the above thesis. Sure, CHPT gained over 30% of equity value since the January opener. At the same time, during the trailing year, shares stumbled nearly 15%. Further, since its public market debut, CHPT gained a bit over 20%. While a positive figure, it’s not necessarily the most impressive.Still, investors should consider one fundamental catalyst: 63% of all occupied housing units feature a garage or carport. That leaves quite a few needing public charging stations. Therefore, the narrative seems to favor CHPT as one of the stocks to buy. Currently, Wall Street analysts peg CHPT as a consensus moderate buy. Also, their average price target of $19.29 implies upside potential of nearly 63%.Polestar Automotive (PSNY)Illustration of blue electric vehicle (EV) charging with dark black backgroundSource: shutterstock.com/DigitalPenPolestar Automotive (NASDAQ:PSNY) makes for an intriguing case for stocks to buy because of its multi-varied approach to transportation. Primarily, Polestar represents a compelling player in the EV market. First, the different design language provides a breath of fresh air. Second, Polestar will introduce a variety of EVs to meet different tastes, from SUVs to crossovers to sports cars.On the other side of the equation, Polestar teamed up with Candela to produce long-range electric-powered boats. Earlier this year, the two firms announced the fruits of their labor with the new Candela C-8. Featuring advanced hydrofoiling technology, the C-8 allows the boat to fly nearly a meter above the water’s surface. It’s wild stuff, articulating the point that even transportation on the high seas will get an upgrade.A word of warning may be necessary: PSNY presents great risks, with shares down nearly 49% in the trailing year. Nevertheless, Wall Street analysts appreciate Polestar, pegging it a consensus moderate buy. Also, their average price target of $10.50 implies upside potential of over 83%.Luminar Technologies (LAZR)Autonomous self driving electric car using lidar change the lane and overtakes city vehicleSource: temp-64GTX / Shutterstock.comLooking well into the future of transportation, more than a few analysts believe that humans won’t be much involved. With advancements in artificial intelligence and machine learning, full automation on the roads may be possible. Certainly, lidar specialist Luminar Technologies (NASDAQ:LAZR) will do whatever it can to make this fantastical notion a reality.Focusing on vision-based lidar and machine perception technologies, Luminar-enabled vehicles use laser sensors to detect the shapes of objects. Along with passenger cars, the company experiments with robotaxis and automation-enabled semi-trailer trucks. While the science undoubtedly intrigues, for investors, the issue comes down to viability. Unfortunately, LAZR presents high risks for prospective buyers. True, shares gained 36% of equity value so far this year. However, in the past 365 days, LAZR hemorrhaged 60%.Nevertheless, Wall Street analysts peg LAZR as a consensus moderate buy. Also, their average price target stands at $17.50, implying upside potential of over 174%.On the date of publication, Josh Enomoto did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.A former senior business analyst for Sony Electronics, Josh Enomoto has helped broker major contracts with Fortune Global 500 companies.

This compares to earnings of $1.58 per share a year ago. These figures are adjusted for non-recurring items.This quarterly report represents an earnings surprise of 14.29%. A quarter ago, it was expected that this insurer would post earnings of $0.59 per share when it actually produced earnings of $0.66, delivering a surprise of 11.86%.Over the last four quarters, the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates three times.American International Group , which belongs to the Zacks Insurance - Multi line industry, posted revenues of $12.17 billion for the quarter ended December 2022, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 2.75%. This compares to year-ago revenues of $13.69 billion. The company has topped consensus revenue estimates just once over the last four quarters.The sustainability of the stock's immediate price movement based on the recently-released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's commentary on the earnings call.American International Group shares have lost about 2.7% since the beginning of the year versus the S&amp;P 500's gain of 7.7%.What's Next for American International Group?While American International Group has underperformed the market so far this year, the question that comes to investors' minds is: what's next for the stock?There are no easy answers to this key question, but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company's earnings outlook. Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter(s), but also how these expectations have changed lately.Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near-term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions. Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried-and-tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank, which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions.Story continuesAhead of this earnings release, the estimate revisions trend for American International Group: favorable. While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company's just-released earnings report, the current status translates into a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) for the stock. So, the shares are expected to outperform the market in the near future. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.It will be interesting to see how estimates for the coming quarters and current fiscal year change in the days ahead. The current consensus EPS estimate is $1.46 on $11.29 billion in revenues for the coming quarter and $6.29 on $48.7 billion in revenues for the current fiscal year.Investors should be mindful of the fact that the outlook for the industry can have a material impact on the performance of the stock as well.

The metric excludes catastrophe losses, and a ratio below 100 shows the insurer earns more from premiums than it pays out in claims.(Reporting by Manya Saini in Bengaluru; Editing by Shinjini Ganguli)]"

(NYSE: AIG) today reported financial results for the fourth quarter and full year ended December 31, 2022.AIG Chairman &amp; Chief Executive Officer Peter Zaffino said: ""2022 was an extraordinary year of progress for AIG. We continued to improve the profitability of our General Insurance business, closing the year with the strongest underwriting results the business has ever achieved and with the second consecutive year of underwriting profitability improving by $1 billion. In addition, we made considerable progress on the separation of our Life and Retirement business and completed the initial public offering (IPO) of Corebridge Financial in September 2022. We reached significant milestones on AIG 200 that modernized our technology infrastructure and operational capabilities, while executing on our target run-rate savings of $1 billion six months ahead of schedule. We revamped AIG’s investment management strategy through strategic partnerships with Blackstone and BlackRock and have transferred approximately $50 billion and $150 billion of assets, respectively, to these partners.""Improvement in General Insurance continued through portfolio optimization, prudent risk selection and limit reduction of over $1.2 trillion since 2018. The full-year 2022 combined ratio of 91.9% represents a 390-basis point year-over-year improvement. The accident year combined ratio, x-CAT of 88.7% improved 230 basis points from prior year, marking the fulfillment of our full-year sub-90 goal and was sub-90 in every quarter of 2022. Our strong momentum continued through the complex January 1 reinsurance renewal season, where the quality of our portfolio enabled us to secure treaties on favorable terms in a very challenging market.""Life and Retirement delivered a solid year with strong sales, particularly in Individual Retirement where Fixed Annuity and Fixed Index Annuity sales continued their robust growth trends. The fixed income portfolio experienced meaningful lift in portfolio yield and widening spreads benefiting from the higher interest rate environment. The capital strength and free cash flow profile of the business remain healthy.""2022 was also a significant year in terms of capital management. We returned over $6.1 billion to shareholders through $5.1 billion of AIG common stock repurchases and $1.0 billion of dividends and Corebridge paid two dividends totaling approximately $300 million in the fourth quarter of 2022 following its IPO in September. We established Corebridge’s capital structure and reduced AIG debt, setting a strong foundation for the future.""In 2022 our colleagues across the globe aligned behind common goals and maintained a steadfast commitment to executing with the highest quality, and I am incredibly proud of the meaningful progress we made. As we look ahead to 2023, the world faces many uncertainties. AIG is better positioned than ever as a risk expert to continue executing on our strategy to deliver excellence as a top-performing company. I am confident we will continue to lead the market and create long-term value for our clients, distribution partners, colleagues, shareholders, and other stakeholders.""For full year 2022, pre-tax income from continuing operations was $14.3 billion, up from $12.1 billion in the prior year. Full year 2022 net income attributable to AIG common shareholders was $10.2 billion, or $13.01 per diluted common share, compared to net income of $9.4 billion, or $10.82 per diluted common share, in the prior year. The increase was largely driven by net realized gains on Fortitude Re funds withheld embedded derivative, strong General Insurance underwriting results, which almost doubled year-over-year, and lower interest expense benefiting from liability management actions, partially offset by lower alternative investment income and call and tender income. The prior year results also included a $3.0 billion gain from the sale of a real estate portfolio. These pre-tax increases were partially offset by higher income tax expense as a result of higher income from operations as well as an increase in income attributable to the noncontrolling interest associated with Blackstone’s 9.9% ownership interest in Corebridge and the IPO of Corebridge in September 2022.AATI was $3.6 billion, or $4.55 per diluted common share, for the full year of 2022 compared to $4.4 billion, or $5.12 per diluted common share, in the prior year. The decrease in AATI was primarily due to lower alternative investment income and call and tender income, partially offset by an increase in General Insurance underwriting income, yield improvement in the fixed maturity and loan portfolios and savings on interest expense.For the fourth quarter of 2022, pre-tax income from continuing operations was $279 million, down from $5.0 billion in the prior year quarter. Fourth quarter 2022 net income attributable to AIG common shareholders was $264 million, or $0.35 per diluted common share, compared to $3.7 billion, or $4.38 per diluted common share, in the prior year quarter. Prior year result included a $3.0 billion gain from the sale of a real estate portfolio. The pre-tax income decline was otherwise primarily due to a decrease in net realized gains on derivative activities.AATI was $1.0 billion, or $1.36 per diluted common share, for the fourth quarter of 2022 compared to $1.3 billion, or $1.58 per diluted common share, in the prior year quarter. The decrease in AATI was primarily due to lower alternative investment income and lower call and tender income, partially offset by improvement in General Insurance underwriting results and yield improvement in the fixed maturity and loan portfolios.Total consolidated net investment income for the fourth quarter of 2022 was $3.3 billion, down 9% from $3.6 billion in the prior year quarter, primarily due to lower alternative investment income and reductions in call and tender income. Interest and dividends income improved $305 million from the prior year quarter with yield across the fixed maturity and loan portfolios up 29 basis points sequentially. Total net investment income on an APTI basis* was $3.0 billion, a decrease of $331 million compared to the prior year quarter.Book value per common share was $53.83 as of December 31, 2022, an increase of 4% from September 30, 2022 and a decrease of 33% from December 31, 2021, driven by a reduction in AOCI as a result of higher interest rates. Adjusted book value per common share* was $73.87, an increase of 1% from September 30, 2022 and 7% from December 31, 2021, reflecting growth in retained earnings from net income in excess of dividends and share repurchases. Adjusted tangible book value per common share* was $67.43, an increase of 1% from September 30, 2022 and 7% from December 31, 2021.For the fourth quarter of 2022, AIG repurchased $779 million of common stock or approximately 13 million shares, paid $243 million of common and preferred dividends, and redeemed $1.8 billion of aggregate principal amount of debt, ending the year with AIG Parent liquidity of $3.7 billion as of December 31, 2022. Corebridge liquidity is no longer reflected in AIG Parent's liquidity following the IPO. AIG’s ratio of total debt and preferred stock to total capital at December 31, 2022 was 34.1%, down from 36.5% at September 30, 2022, due to the redemption of $1.8 billion of debt in the fourth quarter and AOCI mark-to-market adjustments for certain investment portfolios.The AIG Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.32 per share on AIG common stock (NYSE: AIG). The dividend is payable on March 31, 2023 to stockholders of record at the close of business on March 17, 2023.The AIG Board of Directors also declared a quarterly cash dividend of $365.625 per share on AIG Series A 5.85% Non-Cumulative Perpetual Preferred Stock, with a liquidation preference of $25,000 per share, which is represented by depositary shares (NYSE: AIG PRA), each representing a 1/1,000th interest in a share of preferred stock. Holders of depositary shares will receive $0.365625 per depositary share. The dividend is payable on March 15, 2023 to holders of record at the close of business on February 28, 2023.FINANCIAL SUMMARYThree Months Ended December 31, 2022Twelve Months Ended December 31, 2022($ in millions, except per common share amounts)2021202220212022Net income attributable to AIG common shareholders$3,739$264 $9,359$10,247 Net income per diluted share attributable to AIG common shareholders$4.38$0.35 $10.82$13.01 Adjusted pre-tax income (loss)$1,830$1,542 $5,920$5,140 General Insurance1,5091,212 4,3594,430 Life and Retirement969781 3,9112,657 Other Operations(648)(451)(2,350)(1,947)Net investment income$3,565$3,258 $14,612$11,767 Net investment income, APTI basis3,2912,960 12,94010,997 Adjusted after-tax income attributable to AIG common shareholders$1,339$1,024 $4,430$3,586 Adjusted after-tax income per diluted share attributable to AIG common shareholders$1.58$1.36 $5.12$4.55 Weighted average common shares outstanding - diluted (in millions)872.0754.9 864.9787.9 Return on common equity23.0%2.7 %14.5%21.0 %Adjusted return on common equity9.9%7.5 %8.6%6.5 %Book value per common share$79.97$53.83 $79.97$53.83 Adjusted book value per common share$68.83$73.87 $68.83$73.87 Common shares outstanding (in millions)818.7734.1 818.7734.1 GENERAL INSURANCEThree Months Ended December 31,($ in millions)20212022ChangeGross premiums written$8,013$7,594 (5)%Net premiums written$5,961$5,610 (6.0)%North America2,6422,674 1North America Commercial Lines2,2082,272 3North America Personal Insurance434402 (7)International3,3192,936 (12)International Commercial Lines1,9151,763 (8)International Personal Insurance1,4041,173 (16)Underwriting income (loss)$499$635 27%North America152425 180North America Commercial Lines135435 222North America Personal Insurance17(10)NMInternational347210 (39)International Commercial Lines239196 (18)International Personal Insurance10814 (87)Net investment income, APTI basis$1,010$577 (43)%Adjusted pre-tax income$1,509$1,212 (20)%Return on adjusted segment common equity16.1%10.8 %(5.3)ptsUnderwriting ratios:North America Combined Ratio (CR)95.086.6 (8.4)ptsNorth America Commercial Lines CR94.884.4 (10.4)North America Personal Insurance CR96.0102.5 6.5International CR90.193.2 3.1International Commercial Lines CR88.189.4 1.3International Personal Insurance CR93.098.9 5.9General Insurance (GI) CR92.489.9 (2.5)GI Loss ratio61.858.5 (3.3)ptsLess: impact on loss ratioCatastrophe losses and reinstatement premiums(2.9)(3.8)(0.9)Prior year development, net of reinsurance and prior year premiums0.32.3 2.0GI Accident year loss ratio, as adjusted59.257.0 (2.2)GI Expense ratio30.631.4 0.8GI Accident year combined ratio, as adjusted89.888.4 (1.4)Accident year combined ratio, as adjusted (AYCR):North America AYCR89.788.2 (1.5)ptsNorth America Commercial Lines AYCR88.985.9 (3.0)North America Personal Insurance AYCR94.9105.3 10.4International AYCR89.988.6 (1.3)International Commercial Lines AYCR86.781.6 (5.1)International Personal Insurance AYCR94.198.9 4.8General InsuranceNet premiums written (NPW) in the fourth quarter of 2022 decreased 6% from the prior year quarter and increased 1% on a constant dollar basis to $5.6 billion, driven by solid North America Commercial Lines growth of 3% attributed to strong new business and retention and International Commercial Lines growth of 2% on a constant dollar basis. Commercial NPW benefited from strong growth in Lexington, Specialty and Casualty, offset in part by a decline in Financial Lines due to decreased capital markets activities. Personal Insurance NPW decreased 14% or 2% on a constant dollar basis, primarily due to a decrease in Warranty and underwriting actions taken in Private Client Group as the repositioning of this business continues, partially offset by growth in International Accident &amp; Health and Travel.Fourth quarter 2022 APTI decreased by $297 million to $1.2 billion from the prior year quarter due to lower alternative investment income, partially offset by improvement in underwriting income. Underwriting income increased by $136 million to $635 million in the fourth quarter of 2022, which included $235 million of catastrophe losses (CATs), before reinstatement premiums, notably from Winter Storm Elliott, compared to $189 million of CATs in the prior year quarter. Fourth quarter 2022 also included favorable PYD, net of reinsurance, of $151 million compared to favorable PYD of $44 million in the prior year quarter.General Insurance delivered another quarter of strong underwriting results with a combined ratio of 89.9%, a 2.5-point improvement from 92.4% in the prior year quarter, driven by an improvement of 3.3 points in the loss ratio that included higher favorable PYD. The General Insurance AYCR was 88.4%, an improvement of 1.4 points from the prior year quarter with a 2.2-point improvement in the accident year loss ratio, as adjusted* to 57.0%, offset by a 0.8 point increase in the expense ratio to 31.4%. The improvement in accident year loss ratio, as adjusted, reflected continued earn-in of rate in excess of loss cost trends, execution on portfolio management strategy and improvement in Commercial Lines business mix.Commercial Lines underwriting results continued to show strong improvement as a result of continued focus on underwriting excellence and expense management. The combined ratio was 84.4% for North America Commercial Lines and 89.4% for International Commercial Lines. The AYCR for North America Commercial Lines improved 3.0 points to 85.9%, and for International Commercial Lines improved 5.1 points to 81.6% compared to the prior year quarter.Personal Insurance underwriting results deteriorated, reflecting underwriting actions taken to shift business mix in order to reduce exposure and lower premiums in the quarter. The North America Personal Insurance combined ratio was 102.5%, and AYCR of 105.3% deteriorated 10.4 points compared to the prior year quarter, driven by a higher acquisition ratio due to a change in business mix and lower ceding commission. The International Personal Insurance combined ratio was 98.9%, and AYCR of 98.9% deteriorated 4.8 points from the prior year quarter, primarily driven by higher frequency of losses related to restrictions pertaining to COVID-19 deemed hospitalization.LIFE AND RETIREMENTThree Months EndedDecember 31,($ in millions, except as indicated)20212022ChangeAdjusted pre-tax income (loss)$969$781 (19)%Individual Retirement498434 (13)Group Retirement314177 (44)Life Insurance(8)106 NMInstitutional Markets16564 (61)Premiums and fees$3,524$2,879 (18)%Individual Retirement312261 (16)Group Retirement140107 (24)Life Insurance8751,087 24Institutional Markets2,1971,424 (35)Premiums and deposits$8,609$8,800 2%Individual Retirement3,3083,827 16Group Retirement1,8622,243 20Life Insurance1,2061,179 (2)Institutional Markets2,2331,551 (31)Net flows$(1,106)$(744)33%Individual Retirement(34)212 NMGroup Retirement(1,072)(956)11Net investment income, APTI basis$2,357$2,225 (6)%Return on adjusted segment common equity13.7%10.1 ]"
104,8605a6b4-cf34-330d-967c-979f5b21fb29,HOLX,2023-02-16,5 Stocks With High ROE to Buy as Inflation Blows Hot Again,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/5-stocks-high-roe-buy-124612658.html,1676465172,STORY,['HOLX'],"[The U.S. equity markets witnessed intense volatility in the past few trading sessions as inflationary pressures refused to abate, with the consumer price index (CPI) rising more than expected in January. The latest data revealed that CPI was up 0.5% in January following a 0.1% rise in December compared to broad-based expectations of a 0.4% increase. This, in turn, signified that inflation was still a force to reckon with and offered further ammunition to the Fed to continue its aggressive stance against it.A few days earlier, Fed had raised the interest rates by 25 basis points – much akin to the broader expectations – and kept the door ajar for future hikes as it indicated that the battle against inflation was far from over. It also expected economic growth to remain subdued in 2023. Average hourly earnings in January fell 0.2% on a sequential basis and were down 1.8% from a year ago. The uncertain business environment failed to paint a clearer picture of the overall economy and led to the cacophony that drove the broader equity market volatility.As investors employ a wait-and-see approach in a classic example of “backing and filling” in the market, they can benefit from “cash cow” stocks that garner higher returns. However, identifying cash-rich stocks alone does not make for a solid investment proposition unless it is backed by attractive efficiency ratios like return on equity (ROE). A high ROE ensures that the company is reinvesting cash at a high rate of return. THOR Industries, Inc. THO, CNH Industrial N.V. CNHI, Valero Energy Corporation VLO, Hologic, Inc. HOLX and Suzano S.A. SUZ are some of the stocks with high ROE to profit from.Why ROE?ROE = Net Income/Shareholders’ EquityROE helps investors distinguish profit-generating companies from profit burners and is useful in determining the financial health of a company. In other words, this financial metric enables investors to identify companies that diligently deploy cash for higher returns.Moreover, ROE is often used to compare the profitability of a company with other firms in the industry — the higher, the better. It measures how well a company is multiplying its profits without investing new equity capital and portrays management’s efficiency in rewarding shareholders with attractive risk-adjusted returns.Story continuesScreening ParametersIn order to shortlist stocks that are cash-rich with high ROE, we have added Cash Flow greater than $1 billion and ROE greater than X-Industry as our primary screening parameters. In addition, we have taken a few other criteria into consideration to arrive at a winning strategy.Price/Cash Flow lesser than X-Industry: This metric measures how much investors pay for $1 of free cash flow. A lower ratio indicates that investors need to pay less for a better cash flow-generating stock.Return on Assets (ROA) greater than X-Industry: This metric determines how much profit a company earns for every dollar of asset, which includes cash, accounts receivable, property, equipment, inventory and furniture. The higher the ROA, the better it is for the company.5-Year EPS Historical Growth greater than X-Industry: This criterion indicates that continued earnings momentum has translated into solid cash strength.   Zacks Rank less than or equal to 2: Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) stocks are known to outperform irrespective of the market environment.Here are five of the 22 stocks that qualified the screen:THOR Industries: Founded in 1980, Indiana-based Thor Industries is the largest manufacturer of RVs in the world.

Video-on-demand subscriptions in Africa are projected to hit 13.7 million in 2027 up from 4.89 million at the end of 2021 with revenues tripling from $623 million in 2021 to $2 billion in 2027.Read more3 ways to reduce invisible labor for women at work36 ways to build a family-friendly cultureGlobal market leaders are however not entering an unserved market. In Africa, they also face competition from platforms such as MultiChoice-owned Showmax which had over 861,000 subscribers at the end of 2021 in over 40 African countries and several more in the diaspora including the UK, France and Australia. This is in addition to legacy TV players that are also offering mobile subscription products.Africa’s streaming market is mobilePlayers on the continent are competing on several different fronts—including content and user experience, which includes data considerations and ease of payments in a complex market. In much of east Africa, mobile money is an overwhelmingly preferred payment option influencing consumers’ decisions when choosing streaming options and mobile broadband too is how most African users go online.GSMA estimates that by 2025, there will be 613 million unique mobile phone subscribers—half of the population—meaning Africa is a mobile-first market. Cost of data will therefore be a key consideration for streaming companies. In South Africa, for instance, over 90% of the population has access to mobile internet while less than 10% of people have fixed uncapped Internet.Local content is kingOver the past few years, streaming services including Netflix have opened up their eyes to the value that lies in producing local content, a departure from a time when they were more keen on promoting their most popular global titles in Africa and licensing a few local productions. Investment has been ramped up in different local reality shows, comedies, and dramas set across Africa.Story continuesThis strategy is backed by data proving local productions’ popularity with audiences. On Showmax—whose catalog includes shows and movies such as HBO’s Emmy-winning Succession and Hollywood blockbuster Top Gun: Maverick—the most watched titles in 2022 were overwhelmingly local African productions.“Showmax’s audience prefers local content, with seven of the 10 most streamed titles in South Africa, eight of the top 10 titles in Kenya and Nigeria, and nine of the top 10 in Ghana last year being African. This has been a key driver of Showmax’s growth,” the streaming service’s CEO Yolisa Phahle tells Quartz.NetflixOn the other hand, Netflix has since 2019 also been putting money behind African originals. Among them are the star-studded reality show Young, Famous and African featuring celebrities from across the continent, teen crime drama Blood and Water and Queen Sono, another crime drama, among several other titles. This is in addition to many more licensed older titles.Recently, it has signed several multi-project partnership deals with leading African filmmakers and production companies. Its 2022/23 slate includes The King’s Horseman, the film adaptation of Nobel prize-winning writer Wole Soyinka’s play Death and the King’s Horseman. Others are Ludik, Netflix’s first-ever Afrikaans-language drama, African folklore inspired The Brave Ones and South African soccer drama Kings of Queenstown.While Netflix’s global spending on content declined 5% in 2022, the streaming service is spending more than ever on African original content. According to Dorothy Ghettuba, Netflix head of African originals, they’re searching for Squid Game-like global hits from the continent.“We believe that Africa is one of the major creative centers for great storytelling that resonates around the world, so it only makes sense for us to increase our investment with our slate, with an even more exciting slate,” she said in August last year.In Africa, Netflix had an estimated 2.6 million subscribers at the end of 2021, or just 1.1% of its global subscriber base. The total number of Netflix subscribers in Africa is projected to grow to 5.6 million by 2026.ShowmaxShowmax is proving to be one of Netflix’s biggest challengers in African markets including Nigeria, South Africa, Kenya, and Ghana. Its parent company MultiChoice also owns DSTV, the continent’s largest pay TV service with 22 million subscribers. This has given it something of an edge owing to its localized understanding of the market and access to a vast content catalog and broadcasting rights. According to the company, MultiChoice Studios is the largest producer of original content in Africa with over 73,000 hours of co-produced and commissioned titles in its library, in 22 languages.Local content on Showmax ranges from reality shows such as Temptation Island South Africa, Big Brother, and Real Housewives franchises for Abuja, Johannesburg, and Nairobi, to hit series such as Pepeta, Crime and Justice, Blood Psalms, and Crime and Justice Lagos.Its Showmax Pro offering incorporates news and popular live sports including the Premier League, La Liga, Serie A, and South Africa’s PSL among other sporting events, riding on MultiChoice’s control of the rights in Africa.“MultiChoice has over 22 million paying subscribers across 50 countries in Africa, built up over nearly three decades. So Africans are used to paying to access films and TV shows,” Phahle says.Canal+, ROK, Amazon Prime, Disney+Vivendi-owned Canal+ is the largest Pay TV service in Francophone Africa, and also operates the VOD service MyCanal Afrique. To expand its African catalog and audience both on the continent and in the diaspora, Canal+ acquired ROK Studios from Nollywood-focused video streaming company IrokoTV in 2019 for an undisclosed amount.ROK at the time had under its belt more than 540 movies and 25 original TV series. As part of the deal with Canal+, it would continue producing content for IrokoTV as well as several local and international Pay TV channels, including Canal+.Amazon Prime Video has also been aggressively expanding in Africa; going on a hiring spree over the past two years, and signing partnerships with African producers to ramp up its local content. To tap into Nollywood, Prime Video is also “actively exploring the potential of a base of operations in Lagos.”“We now have a dedicated local content strategy for the continent across the board, from originals to be developed and produced by Amazon Studios, to an exciting licensing slate with top-tier producers,” Ned Mitchell, head of originals for Africa and the Middle East for Prime Video and Amazon Studios, told Variety in February.Disney+, one of Netflix’s biggest competitors internationally, expanded into several African markets last year, including South Africa, Egypt, and Algeria.Streaming services are customizing for African audiencesBeyond content, customizing experiences for African audiences and adapting to market trends is also crucial for streaming services in the market. Netflix, for instance, rolled out its first ever free plan in Kenya in 2021 in a bid to get more people to interact with the service, designing it to encourage users to upgrade to the paid tiers.“Content is key, but having an app built with Africa in mind also helps,” Showmax’s Phahle says. “Showmax was the first streaming service in Africa to make mobile downloads possible for offline viewing and to launch a mobile-only plan, and currently offers the lowest data streaming option on the continent.”Legacy media companies in Africa have also entered the race with their own platforms attempting to gain a foothold. In Kenya, for instance, Royal Media Services (RMS) which runs the country’s most popular TV and radio stations, in 2017 launched ViuSasa, whose content is mostly local productions and music. In South Africa, public broadcaster SABC launched its own streaming service SABC+ in November 2022.Mutana Gakuru, a producer and creative economist, says the increased competition is a net positive for African audiences as well as Africa’s creative industries. Competition creates more opportunities for everyone from actors to filmmakers among other professionals, and offers audiences greater variety, he says. The biggest losers, Gakuru says, are legacy media companies whose grip on news and entertainment is loosening fast.He, however, argues that African filmmakers, actors and industry professionals should not hop on the streaming bandwagon simply to be on it, but should instead ensure that their deals reflect the industry’s massive growth.“Overall the effect is positive because there are more opportunities for creatives. More shows require more people developing specialized skills. Competition is providing more opportunities at a large scale and provides for a lot of livelihoods, but streaming services don’t necessarily pay more than the traditional TV stations. It’s like changing employers, the good thing is streaming services are commissioning several productions, sometimes as many as 120 episodes at a time, and this creates a lot more opportunities than there were previously.”More from QuartzRestaurant menu screens are looking at you to decide what you might want to eatSign up for Quartz's Newsletter.

The company is considered one of the best-placed global integrated oil firms to achieve sustainable production ramp-up.America's No. 2 energy firm's existing project pipeline is among the best in the industry, thanks to its premier position in the lucrative Permian Basin. As a reflection of these positives, we expect CVX's EPS to jump 132% in 2022.However, Chevron was not immune to the commodity price crash of 2020, forcing it to cut spending substantially. The company's high oil price sensitivity is a concern too. Moreover, the supermajor's 10-year reserve replacement ratio of 100% is indicative of its inability to replace the amount of oil and gas produced.(You can read the full research report on Chevron here &gt;&gt;&gt;)Shares of Novo Nordisk have outperformed the Zacks Large Cap Pharmaceuticals industry over the past year (+45.8% vs. +14.2%). The company has one of the broadest diabetes portfolios in the industry. Ozempic and Rybelsus have been performing well in the market. Drug sales have been gaining and maintaining momentum.Label expansion of the existing drugs is likely to boost sales further in the days ahead. Ozempic is off to a solid start since its launch and will drive growth for the company. The launch of Rybelsus also looks impressive. The supply issues with Wegovy are resolved now.

The company beat Q4 estimates for earnings and sales. While key drugs like Prolia, Repatha and Evenity are driving sales, increasing competition for its legacy products is hurting the same. Amgen is rapidly advancing its robust pipeline.The acquisition of ChemoCentryx added a strategic new growth asset, Tavneos, to Amgen's portfolio. Amgen boasts a strong biosimilars portfolio with potential new products expected to drive long-term growth.However, increased pricing headwinds and competitive pressure are hurting sales of many of Amgen's products including some biosimilars. Increasing biosimilar competition for some legacy products and weakness in key brands like Otezla and Lumakras, create potential revenue headwinds.(You can read the full research report on Amgen here &gt;&gt;&gt;)Other noteworthy reports we are featuring today include Starbucks Corp. and General Dynamics Corp..Story continuesWhy Haven't You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?

I guess it's not surprising that the board has taken a similar view,"" he said.Analysts have said that the offer does not sufficiently value the long lives of Newcrest's assets and also its contingent of copper, highly prized as a key metal in the energy transition, and was instead capitalising on recent leadership changes at the Australian company.Newcrest is looking for a new chief executive but Duhe declined to offer details on the search.Analysts were looking for Newmont to offer around a 30% premium or around A$31 a share, more than bid which was at a 21% premium to Newcrest's preannouncement share price. Newcrest traded last at A$23.83, down 2% amid declines in gold stocks.Story continuesNewcrest declared a special dividend of 20 cents per share, after Canada's Lundin Gold Inc repaid early a credit facility related to its Fruta del Norte mine in Ecuador.""They have returned the proceeds from the sale of the Lundin financing facilities to shareholders as a special dividend, which I think is good governance,"" Mawhinney added.The miner had beat analyst expectations on higher revenue with the addition of its Canadian Brucejack operations and higher sales volume for gold and copper at its key Cadia mineNewcrest said its underlying profit was $293 million for the half-year ended Dec. 31, beating estimates of $184 million, according to Refinitiv. That compared with an underlying profit of $298 million a year earlier. Lower realized gold and copper prices brought home lesser profit while increased activities and inflation drove up costs.The miner received $1,696 for every ounce of gold sold in the six months ended Dec. 31, compared with $1,733 per ounce logged last year.The company also declared an interim dividend of 15 cents per share, compared with last year's 7.5 cents.(Reporting by Melanie Burton in Melbourne and Roushni Nair and Savyata Mishra in Bengaluru; Editing by Krishna Chandra Eluri and Matthew Lewis)]"

It also wants to have 50GW of renewables projects under some stage of development by then.The expansion in offshore wind is in spite of recent concerns over thinning margins in the sector due to supply chain issues and growing competition, although last week Looney rowed back on plans to cut the company's oil and gas output after BP reported a record profit of $28 billion in 2022.Bausenwein said that some of the inflationary pressure in the offshore wind sector was ""calming down"".

With no Russian gas flowing through either Yamal-Europe or Nord Stream, the only routes for natural gas supplies to Europe are through Ukraine and the Turkstream pipeline across Black Sea. Gazprom's average daily deliveries to Europe for the first 15 days of February increased to 67.8 million cubic meters against 58.1 million cubic meters per day on average in January, according to data from the European Network of Transmission System Operators for Gas (ENTSOG) and from Gazprom data on supplies via Ukraine. Gas pipeline exports to Europe in the first half of February totalled 1 billion cubic metres, according to Reuters calculations. Gazprom, which previously disclosed export data twice a month, has since the beginning of 2023 stopped publishing such data. Gazprom did not respond to a request for comment on the calculations. Gazprom, which holds the world's largest natural gas reserves, was formed out of the Soviet gas industry ministry as the Soviet Union crumbled. It is one of Russia's biggest taxpayers. Russia and Turkey formally launched TurkStream with capacity of 31.5 billion cubic metres per year in January 2020. The pipeline carries Russian natural gas to southern Europe through the Black Sea and Turkey. Gazprom's supplies to the European Union via Turkstream and Ukraine totalled about 1.02 billion cubic meters in the first 15 days of February, of which about 560 million cubic meters, or 37.3 million cubic meters per day, were sent via the Turkish Stream, according to Reuters calculations. Transit through Ukraine amounted to about 458 million cubic meters, or an average of 30.5 million cubic meters per day. In December last year, exports to Europe via these two routes amounted, according to Reuters calculations, to 2.5 billion cubic meters, of which 1.2 billion, or 39.6 million cubic meters per day, went through Turkey. In January, deliveries amounted to about 1.8 billion cubic meters, having decreased by almost 30% by December. For 15 days in January, exports to Europe were at the level of 955 million cubic meters. The throughput capacity of each thread of the Turkish Stream is 15.75 billion cubic meters, or 43.1 million cubic meters per day. One thread is intended for Turkey, the second for European consumers.

The state is facing an election in late March.""We don’t know how the NSW Treasurer can talk about levelling the playing field for coal companies,"" Glencore said in an emailed statement.""Under the updated directions Glencore, which produces about 30% of NSW’s thermal coal, is expected to provide up to 65% of the coal shortfall.""Yancoal Australia and Whitehaven also said they would be impacted.From April 2023 to June 2024, Yancoal will make up to 310,000 tonnes of coal available per quarter for domestic use, while Whitehaven will set aside either 200,000 tonnes or 5% of each of its mine's thermal coal production per quarter, whichever is lower, the companies said on Thursday.Shares in Whitehaven tumbled as much as 12.3% to hit a near six-month low before paring most gains to trade down 2.7%. Yancoal stock dropped 2.3%, while fellow coal miner New Hope Corp slipped 3.8%.The NSW government during its talks with Yancoal on the latest policy told the company it would not be compensated for the difference between market rates and the price it receives selling volumes under the policy, the coal miner said.Story continuesYancoal, however, said it could be eligible for a compensation in certain situations if costs incurred exceed the capped price of coal. Similarly, Whitehaven noted that an application could be made to raise the price cap under certain circumstances.A notice published by the NSW government showed that mines owned by BHP Group and Peabody Energy will also have to comply with the legislation.BHP has said the new policy could affect its plan to keep its Mt Arthur coal mine, the state's largest single coal mine, open until 2030.(Reporting by Melanie Burton in Melbourne Harish Sridharan and Sameer Manekar in Bengaluru; Editing by Subhranshu Sahu, Rashmi Aich and Michael Perry)]"

The company is considered one of the best-placed global integrated oil firms to achieve sustainable production ramp-up.America's No. 2 energy firm's existing project pipeline is among the best in the industry, thanks to its premier position in the lucrative Permian Basin. As a reflection of these positives, we expect CVX's EPS to jump 132% in 2022.However, Chevron was not immune to the commodity price crash of 2020, forcing it to cut spending substantially. The company's high oil price sensitivity is a concern too. Moreover, the supermajor's 10-year reserve replacement ratio of 100% is indicative of its inability to replace the amount of oil and gas produced.(You can read the full research report on Chevron here &gt;&gt;&gt;)Shares of Novo Nordisk have outperformed the Zacks Large Cap Pharmaceuticals industry over the past year (+45.8% vs. +14.2%).

We also cite operational results, which exclude the impact of foreign exchange. With that, I will turn the call over to Kristin.Story continuesKristin Peck: Thank you, Steve and welcome everyone to our fourth quarter and full year 2022 earnings call. Today, we reported strong full year results for 2022, in line with the high-end of our guidance from November and thanks to our diverse portfolio, global scale and talented colleagues. Our 8% operational revenue growth for the year was driven by our innovative companion animal portfolio, which grew 14% operationally while our livestock portfolio declined 2% operationally, primarily due to generic competition and market challenges, especially in the U.S. Thanks to our broad global scale and diversity, we delivered well-balanced operational growth across our U.S. and international segments, which grew 7% and 9% respectively.For the year, we generated operational growth in all of our top 13 markets despite the economic challenges, continued COVID recovery and political uncertainty created by the war in Ukraine. Reflecting our longstanding value proposition, we grew our adjusted net income faster than sales for the year with an operational increase of 11% for the full year and we use this performance and financial strength to continue investing in the R&amp;D, manufacturing capacity and sales and marketing resources to support our future growth and pipeline. As we begin 2023, we will stay adaptable to the evolving macroeconomic factors and geopolitical tensions around the world and focus on executing our plans. We remain very confident in the fundamental and resilient global demand for animal care.And most importantly, we are confident in Zoetis' ability to continue delivering solid sustainable growth as we resolve our prior supply constraints and build share of our market-leading franchises. Looking ahead, we are committed to our track record of value creation and above-market performance even in the face of today's economic uncertainty. We are well positioned with our strategic priorities and capabilities to expand in large and growing product areas like parasiticides, dermatology products, monoclonal antibodies, vaccines and diagnostics. We are guiding to a range of 6% to 8% operational growth for revenue in 2023 and adjusted net income growth in the range of 7% to 9% operationally, which reflects our increased investment plans for R&amp;D and manufacturing to support growth.As the world leader in animal health, a market that has grown on average of 5% to 6% through various economic cycles over the last two decades, we feel very positive about how our portfolio, pipeline and strategy can drive long-term sustainable growth and create value for our customers and shareholders. Wetteny will discuss more details about the 4Q results and full year 2023 guidance, but let me provide some additional perspective on our business and set the stage for some of our growth drivers for the year. First, we have remained the world leader in animal health over the last decade, outperforming the market and bringing groundbreaking innovation to veterinarians, producers and pet owners who care for animals. We marked our 10-year anniversary as a public company on February 1, a decade, which saw us bring more than 2,000 new products and lifecycle innovations to market, build a diverse portfolio, featuring market-leading franchises and 15 current blockbusters generate consistent above-market revenue growth and deliver a total shareholder return of more than 500% all while increasing our market cap from $16 billion in 2013 to about $75 billion today.While we celebrate those accomplishments, I am even more excited about where we can go in the next decade and by the talented colleagues, innovative pipeline and best-in-class capabilities we have brought together at Zoetis. Our colleagues' purpose-driven mindset and steady performance in the face of adversity give me confidence in the continued execution, innovation, growth and durability of our business. As we turn to 2023, we are focused on five key growth catalysts for the year. In dermatology, we see excellent growth opportunities even after nearly a decade of game-changing innovation that began with the introduction of Apoquel in 2014 and has continued with the success of our first monoclonal antibody, Cytopoint, as well as recent lifecycle innovations like Apoquel chewable.We continue to see even more opportunities to grow and expand in this market. In pet parasiticides, the largest single product area in animal health, we continue to gain share and are now the second largest in revenue for this category. We have improved supply in 2023. We expect to continue expanding share in this market and supporting our diverse global portfolio beating Simparica Trio, our triple combination product. In the area of pain, we are off to a great start with our two monoclonal antibodies for osteoarthritis pain, Librela for dogs, which became our latest blockbuster in 2022 and Solensia for cats. We are once again revolutionizing care in this category and seeing very positive early reaction to both products in their large markets as we continue to expand geographies and supply.In terms of the U.S. approval for Librela, we remain confident in receiving approval in the first half of 23 with a leasing plan for late in the year. In diagnostics, we continue to generate solid above-market growth in international markets above our go-to-market model in the U.S. and drive greater global adoption for VETSCAN IMAGYST, our AI-based diagnostics platform. And finally, as population growth and economic mobility drive more demand for animal protein and pets, we see major opportunities in fast-growing emerging markets outside the U.S., where our portfolio is well suited to meet those evolving needs. Overall, our business continues to be weighted towards higher growth, innovation-driven areas in companion animal and these will remain our growth drivers for the foreseeable future.Meanwhile, our livestock portfolio will remain a valuable cash-generating piece of our business as we continue to recover in the U.S. from generic competition and show solid growth in emerging markets. As always, we will stay disciplined yet adaptable, and our approach to the new market opportunities, potential challenges and economic shifts that could occur. And in conclusion, Zoetis remains well positioned in terms of our market leadership, financial strength, investment strategies and diverse portfolio to deliver sustainable growth in 2023. Thank you. And I will hand this off to Wetteny.Wetteny Joseph: Thank you, Kristin and good morning everyone. As Kristin mentioned, we had a strong year in 2022 with revenue of $8.1 billion and adjusted net income of $2.3 billion both in line with the high end of our November full year guidance range. Full year revenue grew 4% on a reported basis and 8% operationally with adjusted net income increasing 3% on a reported basis and 11% operationally. Looking deeper into the operational growth for the year, price contributed 3% to full year operational revenue growth with volume contributing 5%. Volume growth consisted of 4% from new products, including Simparica Trio and our monoclonal antibodies, Librela and Solensia, and 2% from key dermatology products, partially offset by a decline of 1% from other in-line products.Animals, Health, PetsPhoto by Alvan Nee on UnsplashRevenue growth was broad-based with positive operational growth in each of our top 13 markets, which make up approximately 85% of our total revenues with international growing 9% operationally and the U.S. growing 7%. Our growth was driven by continued demand for our innovative new products in our companion animal portfolio, which grew 14% operationally. Our companion animal portfolio now makes up 64% of our global revenues. This growth was partially offset by our livestock business, which declined 2% operationally, primarily due to the generic competition, supply constraints as well as challenging market conditions in certain geographies. Performance in companion animal was driven by our small animal parasiticide portfolio, which grew 20% on an operational basis.Simparica Trio generated $744 million in sales, growing 58% on an operational basis. Our Simparica franchise reached $1 billion in global revenue for the first time in 2022. Our key dermatology products generated $1.3 billion in sales posting strong growth of 17% operationally with double-digit growth in both international and the U.S. Key derm growth in our international markets was especially strong at 27% operationally. We continue to see solid growth in our monoclonal antibodies for osteoarthritis pain. As expected, sales of Librela eclipsed the $100 million mark on the year, marking Zoetis' 15th blockbuster product. We look forward to Librela's expected launch in the U.S. in late 2023. Solensia contributed $30 million in sales in 2022, primarily from international markets, with solid penetration in the U.S. after a launch late in the year.Our companion animal diagnostics portfolio declined 2% operationally in the year, with declines in the U.S., partially offset by growth internationally. Our livestock business declined 2% on an operational basis. Our portfolio continues to be challenged by generic and cheaper alternatives to DRAXXIN in cattle as well as Zoamix in poultry. We do expect the generic impact to begin to moderate in 2023. Additional declines were driven by supply challenges on certain livestock products as well as unfavorable market conditions, especially the U.S. cattle and China swine markets. Moving on to our Q4 financial results, which was another strong quarter. We closed Q4 with revenue of $2 billion, representing an increase of 4% on a reported basis and 9% on an operational basis.Adjusted net income of $539 million is an increase of 14% on a reported basis and 27% operationally. Of the 9% operational revenue growth, 3% is from price and 6% from volume. Volume growth consisted of 3% from new products, which includes Simparica Trio as well as Librela and Solensia and 2% from key dermatology products, while other in-line products grew 1%. Companion animal products grew 15% operationally while our livestock portfolio was flat in the quarter. Simparica Trio was the largest contributor to growth in the quarter, posting global revenue of $171 million, representing operational growth of 39% for the quarter. We expect Simparica Trio to continue to grow the addressable market for fleet taking hardware globally and drive the conversion from collar and top parasiticides to oral combination products.These dynamics will provide additional run-rate for future expansion of the broader market and revenue growth for Trio even once competing triple combination products enter the market. Our key dermatology products, Apoquel and Cytopoint, had solid global growth in the quarter, posting $347 million of revenue, representing 14% operational growth against a robust prior year in which key derm grew 23% operationally in the fourth quarter of 2021. Our monoclonal antibodies for osteoarthritis pain in dogs and cats continue to grow posting $39 million of revenue in the quarter, primarily in international markets. Meanwhile, sales of livestock products were flat on an operational basis in the quarter, with growth in fish and poultry offset by the impact of generics and supply constraints on cattle and swine products.Now moving on to revenue growth by segment for the quarter. U.S. revenue was $1.1 billion in the quarter, growing 7% with companion animal sales growing 12% and livestock sales declining by 6%. Focusing first on companion animal, we returned to double-digit growth in the quarter, as we resolved the majority of our supply issues from earlier in the year. In the U.S. veterinary practice revenue is growing approximately 6% and spending per visit remained strong again this quarter, increasing 10% despite a 4% decline in clinic visits in the quarter. The visit decline reflects comparison to the peak visit numbers in 2021, driven by pandemic after-effects and increased adoption of pets as well as the impact of veterinary workforce challenges that have limited some clinic capacities.Absolute clinic visits remain above pre-pandemic levels. We continue to see growth in the retail segment outpacing other channels. In Q4, sales to our retail partners grew by 49%. Simparica Trio continues to drive growth in the quarter with sales of $158 million in the U.S., growing 39%. With the supply constraints from earlier in the year largely resolved, we were able to leverage promotional efforts to drive growth and regain market share in the quarter. Key dermatology product sales in the U.S. were $239 million for the quarter, growing 11% with Apoquel and Cytopoint, each growing double-digits. We expect to continue the expansion of the market for the foreseeable future. U.S. livestock declined 6% in the quarter as expected, with sales of cattle products impacted by supply restocking for certain products in the third quarter of 2022 as well as the impact of generic competition in cattle and poultry.Moving on to our International segment, where revenue was flat on a reported basis and grew 12% operationally in the quarter. International companion animal revenue grew 21% operationally and livestock grew 4% operationally. Increased sales of companion animal products resulted from growth in our parasiticides portfolio, our key dermatology products and our monoclonal antibodies for alleviation of osteoarthritis pain. Our international small animal parasiticide portfolio had a very strong quarter. Growth was driven by revolution franchise, which rebounded well from supply challenges, especially in China. Our key dermatology products contributed $108 million to revenue and grew 22% on an operational basis in the quarter, with growth in Cytopoint across all key markets and continued double-digit growth of Apoquel.We continue to be pleased with the performance of our oral pain portfolio with Librela generating $26 million and Solensia delivering $7 million in fourth quarter sales internationally. Librela sales in the quarter dipped slightly below the prior quarter due to the removal of supply allocation in certain markets, which led to higher inventory levels at the end of Q3. We expect to see significant contribution to growth in 2023 coming from Librela across our International segment. Moving on to our International Livestock segment, which grew 4% operationally in the quarter. Our fish portfolio grew 25% operationally due to increased demand for vaccines in key salmon markets, including Norway and Chile. Sales of poultry products grew due to increased demand for poultry protein.Growth was partially offset by swine sales, which declined due to supply constraints in certain vaccines across international. The slight decline was partially offset by growth in China, driven by a weak comparative quarter in the prior year and improved swine market conditions. Now moving on to the rest of the P&amp;L for the quarter. Adjusted gross margins of 68.1% decreased 150 basis points on a reported basis compared to the prior year, resulting primarily from unfavorable foreign exchange impacts. Operationally, gross margin declined 60 basis points, driven by higher inventory charges as well as higher manufacturing and freight costs, which were partially offset by favorable price and mix. Operationally, adjusted operating expenses decreased 6% with SG&amp;A declining 9% driven by lower compensation-related expenses and lower advertising and promotion, partially offset by higher freight and logistics related expenses.R&amp;D expenses increased 10% operationally due to higher compensation costs and higher project spend. The adjusted effective tax rate for the quarter was 20.8%, an increase of 220 basis points, primarily due to lower net discrete tax benefits in the quarter and a lower benefit in the U.S. related to foreign-derived intangible income. Adjusted net income grew 27% operationally and adjusted diluted EPS grew 30% operationally for the quarter. Capital expenditures in the fourth quarter were $171 million. In the quarter, we repurchased approximately $400 million of Zoetis shares and returned over $0.5 billion to shareholders through a combination of share repurchases and dividends. For the year, we have repurchased almost $1.6 billion of Zoetis shares and returned over $2.2 billion to shareholders.In December, we announced a 15% annual dividend increase, continuing our commitment to grow our dividend at or faster than the growth in adjusted net income. Now moving on to our guidance for the full year 2023, please note that guidance reflects foreign exchange rates as of late January. We are expecting foreign exchange to have a minimal impact versus the prior year, with the full year impact neutral at revenue and slightly accretive at adjusted net income. The foreign exchange impact in the first half will be unfavorable versus prior year, particularly in the first quarter. In the second half of the year, foreign exchange is expected to be favorable based on the late January exchange rates. For 2023, we are projecting revenue between $8.575 billion and $8.725 billion, representing a range of 6% to 8% operational growth.Volume will be 1% to 2% at the low end of our guidance range and 3% to 4% at the high end. We again expect companion animal to be the primary growth driver in 2023 with the continued strength of our diverse Simparica Trio portfolio, the adoption of our monoclonal antibodies for OA pain and further expansion of our key dermatology products. Despite the decline in vet planning visits last year, industry fundamentals remain strong. Business remain above pre-COVID levels and clinic revenue is at an all-time high as the standard of care continues to increase. We anticipate modest livestock declines in 2023, driven by the generic impact on DRAXXIN sales, particularly in the first half as well as unfavorable market conditions in U.S. cattle. These declines will be partially offset by growth in poultry, driven by increased demand for poultry protein and new product launches as well as fish.The fundamental trends which make livestock an essential business remain intact. I'd like to touch upon the key assumptions that underpin our expectation for revenue growth. For companion animal, we assume a triple combination product we will launch in the U.S. in the first half of 2023 to compete against Simparica Trio. We expect this entrant will help Trio drive the conversion from topicals and collars to triple combination or parasiticides and still project significant growth for Trio. We do not expect competitive entrants in 2023 for our key dermatology products, Apoquel and Cytopoint. We expect another year of robust growth of our key derm portfolio coming from continued expansion of the dermatology market and price. We are excited about the continued growth in our OA franchise and plan to launch in several new markets next year.For the remainder of the P&amp;L, adjusted cost of sales as a percentage of revenue is expected to be in the range of 29.5% to 30%, where favorable foreign exchange price increases and product mix are partially offset by higher input costs. Adjusted SG&amp;A expenses for the year are expected to be between $2.06 billion and $2.1 billion, with the increase from 2022 focused on supporting primary drivers of revenue growth. Adjusted R&amp;D expenses for 2023, is expected to be between $635 million and $660 million. R&amp;D spend can fluctuate year-over-year. This increased investment is reflective of both new projects as well as those advancing in our pipeline. Zoetis is the leader in animal health because of the disruptive innovation, novel products and life cycle enhancements we bring to the market.This increase in R&amp;D expenses reflects our commitment to ensuring our capital allocation prioritizes innovation. Adjusted interest and other income reductions are expected to be approximately $170 million. Our adjusted effective tax rate for 2023 is expected to be in the range of 20% to 21%. Adjusted net income is expected to be in the range of $2.49 billion to $2.54 billion, representing operational growth of 7% to 9%. Our guidance once again reflects our value proposition of growing revenue in line with or faster than the market and growing adjusted net income faster than revenue. We expect adjusted diluted EPS to be in the range of $5.34 to $5.44 and reported diluted EPS to be in the range of $5.03 to $5.14. We are anticipating capital expenditures in 2023 to increase to $950 million to $1 billion.We continue to make investments to support our future growth, including manufacturing capacity for monoclonal antibodies as well as oral solid dosage. Finally, Zoetis and the animal health industry remain resilient in the face of economic headwinds. Our 2023 guidance range is reflective of uncertain macroeconomic conditions and the impact of veterinary clinic labor challenges. While guidance represents our expectations for the full year, Q1 revenue is expected to be below the low end of the operational growth rate in our full year guidance due to a variety of reasons. First, Q1 2022 was a strong comparable quarter as we saw robust growth with limited impact from vet clinic labor constraints as well as minimal disruption from our diagnostics field force model change, which began in Q2.Additionally, in the quarter, we expect to see lingering impacts of the latest COVID wave in China. Lastly, the return of supply on certain products, including Simparica Trio, and subsequent channel restocking as well as promotions to regain share in Q4 2022 modestly increased inventory levels in the channel in the short-term. In Q1, we expect a modest decline in adjusted net income versus the prior year as a result of the timing of our 2022 sales force extension in the U.S., which did not start until Q2, as well as the R&amp;D investment noted earlier, which is also off a low base in Q1 2022. Now to summarize. 2022 was another strong year despite some challenges, we significantly outperformed the market and continue to take share, all while growing the bottom line faster than the top line.As we begin 2023, we once again expect to grow faster than the market, driven by the strength of our innovative portfolio, our ability to successfully launch new products and expand existing markets and our confidence in the end market dynamics for the spaces we compete in.

Three and twelve months ended 12/31/2022 excludes Winter Storm Uri income of $135 million.Fourth quarter Net Loss was $1.1 billion, $668 million lower than the fourth quarter of 2021. This was driven by the higher recovery of Winter Storm Uri mitigants in the fourth quarter of 2021, higher unrealized mark-to-market losses on economic hedges in the fourth quarter of 2022 primarily in the East, due to large movements in natural gas and power prices, and the gain on 4.8 GW of fossil generation asset sales in December 2021. This was partially offset by lower impairment losses in the fourth quarter of 2022 and higher income tax benefits.Story continuesFourth quarter 2022 and 2021 Cash Used by Operating Activities were ($1.4) billion, primarily driven by decreases in collateral deposits received in support of risk management activities as a result of large movements in natural gas and power prices.Segment ResultsTable 1: Net (Loss)/Income(In millions)Three Months EndedTwelve Months EndedSegment12/31/202212/31/202112/31/202212/31/2021Texas$215$693$1,265$1,290East(1,759)(1,213)3261,907West/Services/Othera44993(370)(1,010)Net (Loss)/Income($1,095)($427)1,221$2,187a.

This increase was primarily driven by partial settlements of insurance claims related to the W.A. Parish and Limestone extended outages and increased margin rates. This was partially offset by higher supply costs as a result of Winter Storm Elliott in December 2022, and higher ancillary charges.East: Fourth quarter Adjusted EBITDA was $180 million, $47 million lower than the fourth quarter of 2021. This decrease was driven by the December 2021 4.8 GW asset sales, PJM asset retirements, and estimated capacity performance net impact resulting from Winter Storm Elliott.West/Services/Other: Fourth quarter Adjusted EBITDA was $55 million, $10 million higher than the fourth quarter of 2021.

(Vivint) announced the entry into a definitive agreement under which the Company will acquire Vivint, a smart home platform company, in an all-cash transaction. The acquisition accelerates the realization of NRG’s consumer-focused growth strategy and creates a leading essential home services platform fueled by market-leading brands, unparalleled insights, proprietary technologies, and complementary sales channels. The Company expects to achieve $100 million in cost synergies and $300 million in revenue synergies/growth through cross-selling, channel optimization, and continued base business growth by 2025.The Company will pay $12 per share, or approximately $2.8 billion in cash, and expects to fund the acquisition using proceeds from newly issued debt and preferred equity, drawing on its Revolving Credit Facility and Receivables Securitization Facilities, and through cash on hand. Additionally, NRG increased its Revolving Credit Facility by $600 million in February 2023 to meet the additional liquidity requirements related to the acquisition. Close of the acquisition is targeted for the first quarter of 2023 and is subject to customary closing conditions.In connection with the merger agreement, NRG entered into a commitment letter for a senior secured 364-day bridge term loan facility in a principal amount not to exceed $2.1 billion for the purposes of financing the Vivint acquisition, paying fees and expenses in connection with the acquisition, and certain other third-party payments in respect of arrangements of Vivint.Sale of AstoriaOn January 6, 2023, NRG closed on the sale of land and related assets from the Astoria site, within the East region of operations, for net proceeds of $209 million. As part of the transaction, NRG entered into an agreement to lease the land back for the purpose of operating the Astoria gas turbines through the planned April 30, 2023 retirement date. The operating lease agreement is expected to end six months after the facility's actual retirement date.W.A. Parish Extended OutageIn May 2022, W.A. Parish Unit 8 came offline as a result of damage to the steam turbine/generator. Based on work completed to date, NRG is targeting to return the unit to service by the end of the second quarter of 2023. The Company is working with its insurers related to claims surrounding the outage and has received partial settlements in the fourth quarter of 2022.Reaffirming 2023 GuidanceNRG is reaffirming its standalone Adjusted EBITDA and FCFbG guidance for 2023 as set forth below.Table 4: 2023 Adjusted EBITDA, Cash Provided by Operating Activities, and FCFbG Guidance2023(In millions)GuidanceAdjusted EBITDAa$2,270 - $2,470Cash Provided by Operating Activities$1,780 - $1,980FCFbG$1,520 - $1,720a. Non-GAAP financial measure; see Appendix Table A-8 for GAAP Reconciliation to Net Income that excludes fair value adjustments related to derivatives. The Company is unable to provide guidance for Net Income due to the impact of such fair value adjustments related to derivatives in a given year.Capital Allocation UpdateAs part of NRG’s long-term capital allocation plan, the return of capital to shareholders during the twelve months ending December 31, 2022 was comprised of the annual dividend of $1.40 per share, or $332 million, and share repurchases of $606 million at an average price of $40.50 per share, for a total amount of capital returned to shareholders of $938 million in 2022. The Company’s $1 billion share repurchase program began with $39 million of shares repurchased in December of 2021, resulting in $645 million of shares repurchased under that program to date. The program is expected to be completed in 2023, subject to availability of cash and full visibility of the achievement of the Company’s 2023 targeted credit metrics.In 2023, the Company expects to use its excess free cash flow to fund the Vivint acquisition, reduce acquisition-related debt, and maintain its common stock dividend. In addition, NRG is targeting additional asset sales with projected proceeds, net of any required deleveraging, of $500 million during 2023. Following the completion of the Vivint acquisition, the Company plans to update 2023 capital allocation.NRG is committed to maintaining a strong balance sheet and credit ratings, and remains focused on achieving investment grade credit metrics. The Company expects to achieve 2.50x to 2.75x corporate net debt to adjusted EBITDA by late 2025 or 2026, which will be primarily achieved through debt reduction and the realization of growth initiatives.On January 20, 2023, NRG declared a quarterly dividend on the Company's common stock of $0.3775 per share, or $1.51 per share on an annualized basis. This dividend represents an 8% increase from the prior year, which is in line with the Company’s previously announced dividend growth rate target of 7% to 9% per year.Earnings Conference CallOn February 16, 2023, NRG will host a conference call at 9:00 a.m. Eastern (8:00 a.m. Central) to discuss these results.

130,ff980c22-1acc-30d0-bc69-8b6e8dceb593,NRG,2023-02-16,Hotter-Than-Expected Inflation Rattles Wall Street: 5 Safe Picks,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/hotter-expected-inflation-rattles-wall-140002540.html,1676469602,STORY,"['NRG', 'MGEE', 'CPB']","[Inflation, regrettably, turned higher to begin 2023. From gas to fuel to shelter, prices have scaled upward and hurt American consumers. The Labor Department noted that the consumer price index (CPI), which primarily encompasses the broader basket of goods and services, increased 0.5% in January and resulted in a year-over-year gain of 6.4%. However, analysts were mostly expecting a month-over-month gain of 0.4% and an annual gain of 6.2%.Most importantly, the core CPI, which eliminates volatile energy and food prices, advanced 0.4% in January and 5.6% compared to a year ago. But market pundits had forecast the core CPI to increase 0.3% monthly and 5.5% from a year ago. The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics highlighted that the increase in shelter costs mostly led to an uptick in overall inflation.Shelter costs, which account for more than one-third of the CPI, increased 0.7% in January and were up 7.9% year over year. Energy and food costs were also major contributors. While energy prices were up 2% monthly and 8.7% from a year ago, food costs increased 0.5% monthly and 10.1% annually, added the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics.Consequently, inflation continues to remain stubbornly higher so far this year, even though it had shown signs of easing in the latter half of last year. But hotter-than-anticipated inflation raised worries about a more aggressive Fed. After all, the central bank officials are bent on taming the rise in prices of indispensable goods and services and henceforth may be bound to remain hawkish.According to the CME’s FedWatch tool, market pundits are now factoring in 74.3% odds of a 25 basis points hike in interest rates in May, as well as in June, thanks to the more-than-expected increase in January’s inflation. Anyhow the odds of a further increase in interest rates this year have already increased due to January’s blowout employment report. All in all, investors do expect interest rates to increase above 5% and continue to hover at that level until 2024.Story continuesUnfortunately, rate hikes don’t bode well for the economy, which, at the moment, is facing the threat of an imminent recession. Rate hikes impact consumers’ spending habits, increase borrowing costs and deter economic growth. Perhaps that’s the reason why major indexes like the S&amp;P 500 and the Dow slipped on Feb 14 after inflation turned higher than projected.But investors shouldn’t freak out! On the contrary, they should place their bets on stocks that provide risk-adjusted returns like Conagra Brands CAG, Campbell Soup CPB, NRG Energy NRG, Global Water Resources GWRS and MGE Energy MGEE.These stocks are part of the consumer staples and utility sectors, or in other words, whose businesses are non-cyclical in nature, making them immune to market vagaries. Additionally, they are dividend players indicating better quality business, which helps them bear market volatility. To top it off, they are low-beta (ranges from 0 to 1) stocks making them less unstable compared to the broader market. These stocks also boast a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy).

132,46aa6ed5-b302-37cd-bb3a-61f44a487751,NEE,2023-02-16,3 Best Renewable Energy Stocks to Buy for February 2023,InvestorPlace,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/3-best-renewable-energy-stocks-172733635.html,1676222853,STORY,"['PLUG', 'NEE-PR', 'LTHM']","[Economies across the world are working on switching to energy sources that cause less damage to the environment. Because of climate change concerns, more and more countries are moving away from carbon-based fossil fuels to renewable energy sources. The renewable energy industry is growing rapidly as companies look for ways to decarbonize the economy. Owners of the best renewable energy stocks will be able to make the most of the transition toward a greener and cleaner world.In an attempt to encourage companies to move towards renewable energy sources, President Biden signed the $369 billion Inflation Reduction Act and it was one of the largest climate investments in the history of the country. The funding aimed to boost the production of renewables and provided tax credits that would help private investment in the sector. The renewable energy sector could be massive in the future and if you want to make the most of it, you need to get into the industry before it becomes hot. As per Allied Market Research, the global renewables market will hit a valuation of about $1.98 trillion in 2030 and this is no small feat. If you are ready to dive in, here are the three best renewable energy stocks to buy this month.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsPLUGPlug Power$15.36LTHMLivent$24.46NEENextEra Energy$73.27Plug Power (PLUG)Plug Power logo on computer screen. PLUG stock.Source: Postmodern Studio / ShutterstockAt the top of my list is Plug Power (NASDAQ:PLUG), which remains one of the best hydrogen stocks to own this month. The company is engaged in the development of hydrogen fuel systems that replaces conventional batteries. PLUG stock is up 11% over the past month and is up 30% year-to-date. The stock is trading at $15 today, almost half of its 52-week high of $32. When it comes to fundamentals, Plug Power has a few vulnerabilities and hasn’t been able to beat EPS projections over the past year due to supply chain challenges when launching new products. It expects a growth of 45% to 50% this year as compared to the expectations of 80%.Story continuesDespite being unprofitable, the company is making strong moves in the industry. It recently announced a strategic partnership with Johnson Matthey or JM where JM will supply membranes, and catalysts and will help Plug in hitting the targeted revenue of $5 billion by 2026 and $30 billion by 2030.Both companies are expected to co-invest in the largest CCM manufacturing facility in the world which will begin production in 2025. This partnership is a sign that Plug Power is planning to go all in when it comes to the hydrogen sector. Hydrogen is a huge market and Plug aims to be at the top of it. That said, the company will also benefit from the tax credit on green hydrogen of up to $3 per kilogram that took effect at the beginning of the year.The company expects to hit $5 billion in sales by 2026 and if the company achieves the same, there is no stopping it. PLUG is a potential leader in a hot new industry but expects the stock to take time to pick pace.Livent Corp. (LTHM)Livent Corporation logo on a phone screen. LTHM stock.Source: Ralf Liebhold / ShutterstockAfter a hydrogen stock, the next on the list is a lithium stock, Livent (NYSE:LTHM). Lithium-ion batteries power electric vehicles and this is where the company could win. Livent Corporation is already a global player in the market and has 6 manufacturing facilities across the world. It is taking big strides to increase production across China, Argentina, and Canada. The company expects to produce 15,000 tonnes from the Chinese operations by the end of this year and not to forget, the company has a 30-year expected mine life in Quebec by 2026. LTHM stock is one of the best renewable energy stocks for its potential to grow with the growing adoption of electric vehicles.The company already has a long-term supply agreement with General Motors (NYSE:GM) to deliver lithium hydroxide starting in 2025 and I believe this is only the beginning for the company. It has sound fundamentals and the company managed to beat EPS estimates for the last four quarters despite the market turmoil. In the last quarter, it reported a revenue of $231.6 million, up 124% from the same quarter the previous year. It is expanding on a massive scale with a 5,000 metric ton expansion of lithium hydroxide in Bessemer City and plans to add 10,000 metric tons of capacity in Argentina this year. LTHM stock is trading at $25 today and is up 30% year-to-date. This is a highly undervalued stock worth adding to your portfolio. It was upgraded to Buy from Underperform at BofA last month with a price target of $26.NextEra Energy (NEE)Nextra Energy (NEE) website on a mobile phone screenSource: madamF / Shutterstock.comThis is the third renewable energy stock with a huge potential to grow. NextEra Energy (NYSE:NEE) is the world’s largest renewable energy company and is engaged in the production of electricity from renewable resources and the sale of electric energy across Florida. It is also involved in green hydrogen which will continue to play a huge role in the transition towards renewable energy and decarbonising the industrial areas which account for a huge amount of carbon emissions. The company expects the hydrogen market to grow by $60 billion annually by 2050. NEE stock is trading at $73 today and is also a solid dividend play. It has already grown the dividend at a rate of 11.6% over the last five years and enjoys a dividend yield of 2.23%. Since the demand for electricity does not change too much, the company remains insulated which makes NEE one of the best renewable energy stocks to buy. My InvestorPlace colleague Samuel O’Brient explains how NEE stock will benefit from Biden’s State of the Union Address.In the recent earnings report, the company reported a revenue of $6.16 billion where the solar and wind business contributed $2.09 billion and the utility business, Florida Power &amp; Light accounted for $4.07 billion. Recently, the independent director, John Stall bought $300K worth of stock which is a great sign as it boosted the holding to 101%. If there is one renewable energy stock that offers a dividend and stability, it is NEE stock.On the date of publication, Vandita Jadeja did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.Vandita Jadeja is a CPA and a freelance financial copywriter who loves to read and write about stocks.

The number of drilling rigs rose by 22 percent in 2022, but this was still 10 percent below 2019 levels.""While we ramp up investment in renewables and pursue the energy transition, we also need to lift investment in oil and gas to support the global economy, and protect the quality of life for everyone,"" said Joseph McMonigle, Secretary General of the IEF.The recovery in 2022 marked a change from the previous two years, when capital expenditure slumped with the COVID-19 pandemic contributing to a tightening of global energy markets, price spikes and shortages of natural gas.""The global economy continues to need adequate and reasonably priced hydrocarbon supply alongside the scaling up of renewables and low-carbon technologies,"" said Daniel Yergin, Vice Chairman of S&amp;P Global. ""The energy future must be secure and affordable, as well as sustainable. Adequate investment that avoids shortages and prices spikes, and the economic hardship and social turbulence that they bring, is essential to that future.""A cumulative $4.9 trillion will be needed from now until 2030 to meet market needs, even if the growth in oil and gas demand slows down, the report says.""As we saw last year, high energy prices and volatility have disastrous effects on households all over the world, hitting the poorest people the hardest. Underinvestment in oil and gas threatens energy security and stalls progress on climate goals by increasing reliance on more carbon-intensive options,"" said Mr. McMonigle.Story continuesThe report says that if consumer countries wish to support markets they would need to send clear signals about future demand, building and maintaining sufficient inventories, supporting long-term offtake contracts, and preventing prohibitive policies.Meanwhile, producers can support markets by promoting investment, it says. Operators need a certain level of assurance and fiscal certainty to invest in capital-intensive, long-cycle projects. They will be increasingly constrained in committing capital, or will require higher returns to do so, as risks evolve, the report says.""Future supply must clear an acceptable hurdle rate that accounts for policy uncertainty, variable oil and gas prices, and, increasingly, carbon price assumptions,"" the report says.Additionally, governments should base policies on realistic energy demand outlooks and to ensure adequate and affordable energy supplies during the transition, the report says. ""Governments need to ensure assumptions do not underestimate energy demand growth coming from the 80 percent of the global population in the developing world,"" it says.Mr. McMonigle said: ""We don't yet have viable alternatives to oil and gas to power heavy industry, food production or plastics. So, the transition to a carbon neutral economy is challenging and will take time and innovation. Even as we invest in new technologies to cut greenhouse gas emissions, we also need to invest in oil and gas during the transition.""The report's authors are Roger Diwan and Karim Fawaz from S&amp;P Global Commodity Insights and Mason Hamilton and Allyson Cutright at the IEF.

Investing can be complex, but it can also be very simple. Simply investing in these three major U.S. indices would have generated significant returns over the past decade. Over the past 10 years, the Dow, S&amp;P 500, and NASDAQ have gained 144%, 172%, and 272%, respectively.It wouldn't be feasible to invest in all 500 stocks of the S&amp;P 500, for example. However, you can add an S&amp;P 500 ETF to your portfolio, giving you ample diversification and exposure to the growth of hundreds of the best companies in the United States. It's sensible for all investors to have some exposure to the broader indices, and it's a great way for new investors to start their portfolios with instant diversification.Investors can use these three ETFs to add the breadth and depth of these three indices to their portfolios. Vanguard S&amp;P 500 ETF (VOO)Investing in the Vanguard S&amp;P 500 ETF is an effective way to gain exposure to the power of the S&amp;P 500 as a whole. This massive ETF has $281 billion in assets under management.As you might expect, since it covers the entire S&amp;P 500, VOO ETF is very diversified with 506 holdings, and VOO's top 10 holdings only make up 24.3% of the fund, essentially mirroring the concentration of the S&amp;P 500 itself. The Vanguard S&amp;P 500's top holding is the largest stock in the S&amp;P 500 by market cap, Apple, which accounts for 6% of the fund.The rest of the top 10 is rounded out by familiar names, including tech giants like Microsoft, Alphabet, Amazon, Tesla, and Nvidia, as well as large-cap stocks from other sectors like Berkshire Hathaway, ExxonMobil, and UnitedHealth Group.VOO pays a dividend and currently yields 1.6%, which is roughly in line with the average yield of the S&amp;P 500. Vanguard is known for its low-cost funds and ETFs, and VOO is no different, with a minuscule expense ratio of just 0.03%.Story continuesThe Vanguard S&amp;P 500 ETF has a favorable Smart Score of 8. Its average analyst price target of $421.99 indicates upside of 11.3% from current levels. Blogger sentiment is bullish, while hedge fund involvement is decreasing.Last year, VOO stock fell 18.2%, closely tracking the performance of the S&amp;P 500. However, things are looking up in 2023 as the ETF is up 8.4% year to date. Ultimately, the Vanguard S&amp;P 500 is an efficacious and cost-effective way to add exposure to the entire S&amp;P 500 to your portfolio.Invesco QQQ Trust (QQQ)The Invesco QQQ Trust ETF, often referred to colloquially as ""The Q's,"" is a massive $161 billion ETF that invests in the 100 largest non-financial companies in the Nasdaq.The Nasdaq is the index that is most closely associated with the technology sector, so it is unsurprising that most of QQQ's top holdings here are the same tech stocks that make up VOO’s top holdings. Stocks like Microsoft, Apple, Amazon, Alphabet, NVIDIA, Meta Platforms, and Tesla dominate the top 10 holdings. Pepsi is the one notable non-tech stock amongst the top 10 holdings.While QQQ is a diversified ETF with 102 holdings, it is much more concentrated than VOO. Its top 10 holdings make up 53.2% of the fund. Like VOO, QQQ pays a dividend and currently yields 0.7%.The Invesco QQQ Trust has a positive ETF smart score of 8 out of 10, indicating an Outperform rating, and the consensus price target of $341.20 implies 11.5% upside from today’s prices. Meanwhile, blogger sentiment is positive, while hedge fund involvement is decreasing.Tech stocks had a tough go of it in 2022, so it's unsurprising that QQQ lost 32.5% last year. However, investor enthusiasm for tech has returned in 2023, and QQQ has soared to a 13.3% gain year-to-date. Overall, the Invesco QQQ Trust is a cost-effective way (0.20% expense ratio) to add the innovation of the large-cap tech stocks in the Nasdaq 100 to your portfolio.SPDR Dow Jones Industrial Average ETF (DIA)In some ways, the much larger S&amp;P 500 has overtaken the Dow Jones Industrial Average as the dominant barometer for the U.S. economy. However, the Dow Jones is still viewed as a blue-chip index of world-class companies.Being in the Dow Jones Industrial Average essentially screens out “bad."" This is because Dow components have to be profitable and must have an excellent reputation, sustained growth, and be of interest to a large number of investors, according to S&amp;P Global (the company that maintains both the S&amp;P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average).The Dow Jones only includes 30 companies, so the SPDR Dow Jones Industrial Average ETF is naturally much more concentrated than the S&amp;P 500 or Nasdaq ETFs listed above. The ETF has 31 holdings, and DIA's top 10 holdings make up 55.2% of the fund.Unlike the S&amp;P 500 or the Nasdaq, the Dow is a price-weighted index, so high-priced Dow components like UnitedHealth have an outsize position in the fund. UNH, the health insurance giant, makes up nearly 10% of the fund.The rest of the top 10 is essentially a who's who of iconic U.S. companies like Goldman Sachs, Home Depot, McDonald’s, Caterpillar, and Visa, with Microsoft serving as the lone representative from ‘big tech.’Because DIA isn’t as exposed to tech as VOO or QQQ, it soundly outperformed both ETFs last year (just as the Dow itself outperformed the S&amp;P 500 and the Nasdaq), with a loss of 7% for 2022. However, as you might guess, DIA is lagging behind these two counterparts as tech rebounds in 2023, with a 2.4% gain year-to-date.The SPDR Dow Jones Industrial Average ETF Trust has a neutral ETF Smart Score of 7. Further, the average DIA stock price target of $370.67 indicates upside potential of 8.7% from current pricing.Like the other two ETFs above, DIA pays a dividend and yields 1.9%. Like its counterparts, it also features an investor-friendly expense ratio of 0.16%.Investor TakeawayIn conclusion, history shows that investing in indices like the Dow, S&amp;P 500, and Nasdaq is a fruitful way to invest over the long term. These 3 ETFs offer investors a way to gain exposure to each index in an effective, easy, and inexpensive manner.All three of these indices look like sensible investments over the long term. Note that the Dow outperformed the others last year, thanks to its lower exposure to tech, while the QQQ is outperforming this year as tech rebounds. The VOO ETF may be the best way to get ""the best of both worlds"" as it features a mix of tech stocks and “old economy” stocks.Disclosure]"

It also wants to have 50GW of renewables projects under some stage of development by then.The expansion in offshore wind is in spite of recent concerns over thinning margins in the sector due to supply chain issues and growing competition, although last week Looney rowed back on plans to cut the company's oil and gas output after BP reported a record profit of $28 billion in 2022.Bausenwein said that some of the inflationary pressure in the offshore wind sector was ""calming down"".

No decision has been reached to proceed with a transaction and there can be no assurances it will happen, the company said.Shares rose 7.8% to C$60.62 at 12:06 a.m. in Toronto, the highest intraday price in 12 years.Teck has been weighing options for its coal division for over a year in a strategic shift toward mining more of the metals such as copper that are crucial to the global energy transition. Metallurgical coal is used in steelmaking, which is among the most polluting industries and faces significant pressure from policymakers.Teck is one of the world’s largest exporters of metallurgical coal. The company produced more than 24 million metric tons in 2021 from four different operations in western Canada, according to its filings. The business accounted for 55% of the company’s gross profit.Teck has been exploring options for the business since at least September 2021, when people familiar with the matter said the business could be worth about $8 billion.A coal spinoff would leave Teck with a suite of copper and zinc mines across the Americas, including the Quebrada Blanca 2 copper project in Chile that has long been admired by some of its biggest rivals. It also owns a stake in the Antamina copper and zinc operation with BHP Group and Glencore Plc.Story continuesThe world’s biggest miners are increasingly looking to exit fossil fuels. Rio Tinto Group has exited coal altogether, while Anglo American Plc has sold out of thermal coal. BHP divested some of its thermal coal and quit oil and gas altogether. BHP and Anglo still have large met coal operations, the sort of coal Teck is looking to hive off.Attractive TargetSeparating the coal business would likely make Teck an attractive target for large mining companies such as BHP and Rio Tinto that have been hunting for takeovers to expand in industrial metals — providing the family that controls the shares would be willing to sell.Teck’s standalone base metals business would make a very attractive M&amp;A target should the controllers ever decide to sell, Citibank analyst Alexander Hacking said in a note Thursday.“The question going forward is whether additional value can be surfaced by splitting the company, at the expense of the diversification and scale benefits,” RBC Capital Markets analyst Sam Crittenden said in a Thursday note. “We don’t see an obvious buyer for the met coal business so this would largely be a standalone met coal business.”Bloomberg reported last month that the world’s biggest producers have rediscovered an appetite for mega deals, after years of staying on the sidelines.(Updates with company comment, shares from second paragraph.)Most Read from Bloomberg BusinessweekThe World’s War Machine Is Running Low on AmmunitionZantac’s Maker Kept Quiet About Cancer Risks for 40 YearsFear Made John McAfee Rich.

With no Russian gas flowing through either Yamal-Europe or Nord Stream, the only routes for natural gas supplies to Europe are through Ukraine and the Turkstream pipeline across Black Sea. Gazprom's average daily deliveries to Europe for the first 15 days of February increased to 67.8 million cubic meters against 58.1 million cubic meters per day on average in January, according to data from the European Network of Transmission System Operators for Gas (ENTSOG) and from Gazprom data on supplies via Ukraine. Gas pipeline exports to Europe in the first half of February totalled 1 billion cubic metres, according to Reuters calculations. Gazprom, which previously disclosed export data twice a month, has since the beginning of 2023 stopped publishing such data. Gazprom did not respond to a request for comment on the calculations. Gazprom, which holds the world's largest natural gas reserves, was formed out of the Soviet gas industry ministry as the Soviet Union crumbled. It is one of Russia's biggest taxpayers. Russia and Turkey formally launched TurkStream with capacity of 31.5 billion cubic metres per year in January 2020. The pipeline carries Russian natural gas to southern Europe through the Black Sea and Turkey. Gazprom's supplies to the European Union via Turkstream and Ukraine totalled about 1.02 billion cubic meters in the first 15 days of February, of which about 560 million cubic meters, or 37.3 million cubic meters per day, were sent via the Turkish Stream, according to Reuters calculations.

The state is facing an election in late March.""We don’t know how the NSW Treasurer can talk about levelling the playing field for coal companies,"" Glencore said in an emailed statement.""Under the updated directions Glencore, which produces about 30% of NSW’s thermal coal, is expected to provide up to 65% of the coal shortfall.""Yancoal Australia and Whitehaven also said they would be impacted.From April 2023 to June 2024, Yancoal will make up to 310,000 tonnes of coal available per quarter for domestic use, while Whitehaven will set aside either 200,000 tonnes or 5% of each of its mine's thermal coal production per quarter, whichever is lower, the companies said on Thursday.Shares in Whitehaven tumbled as much as 12.3% to hit a near six-month low before paring most gains to trade down 2.7%. Yancoal stock dropped 2.3%, while fellow coal miner New Hope Corp slipped 3.8%.The NSW government during its talks with Yancoal on the latest policy told the company it would not be compensated for the difference between market rates and the price it receives selling volumes under the policy, the coal miner said.Story continuesYancoal, however, said it could be eligible for a compensation in certain situations if costs incurred exceed the capped price of coal. Similarly, Whitehaven noted that an application could be made to raise the price cap under certain circumstances.A notice published by the NSW government showed that mines owned by BHP Group and Peabody Energy will also have to comply with the legislation.BHP has said the new policy could affect its plan to keep its Mt Arthur coal mine, the state's largest single coal mine, open until 2030.(Reporting by Melanie Burton in Melbourne Harish Sridharan and Sameer Manekar in Bengaluru; Editing by Subhranshu Sahu, Rashmi Aich and Michael Perry)]"

He is currently serving as the Managing Principle and Co-Chief Investment Officer of the firm.Greenblatt is mainly known for his ‘Magic Formula’ investing technique, which he introduced in his book ‘The Little Book that Still Beats the Market’. This technique takes its inspiration from Buffett/Graham's value approach. According to this strategy, investors should focus on high-quality companies with cheap valuations and strong fundamentals. The strategy further elaborates that through return on capital employed (ROCE) and earnings yield investors can find a great combination of quality and cheap value stocks.Over the years, Joel Greenblatt’s investment technique has resulted in his hedge fund delivering solid returns to shareholders. Over the past three years, Gotham Large Value Fund (GVALX) has gained 10.6%, compared with a 9.88% return of the S&amp;P 500.As of the close of Q4 2022, Gotham Asset Management holds a 13F portfolio value of over $3.5 billion, compared with $3.3 billion in the previous quarter.

That tune began to change at the end of July and accelerated in August and September, as major players, such as Walmart (NYSE:WMT), has recently issued profit warnings and/or have withdrawn guidance.

Their main counterparty is the US government, a key customer in what is known as a monopsonist position. This is a rather unusual situation, but one that is very advantageous for companies such as LMT. (Click here to see the full text)7.

But to think the macroeconomic concerns have faded is wrong. The central bank is expected to keep interest rates high till inflation comes down reasonably.This has made investors cautious, as higher rates will likely lead to a recession/economic slowdown this year. The bearish sentiments are leading to huge market volatility, making it difficult for individual investors to pick stocks independently and generate solid returns. One way to choose the right stocks in the current situation is to follow rating upgrades by brokers. In this regard, stocks like The Kroger Co. KR, Expedia Group, Inc. EXPE and Ralph Lauren Corporation RL are worth a look.As brokers directly communicate with the top management, they have a deeper understanding of what is happening in a particular company. They precisely assess companies’ publicly available documents and even attend conference calls.Brokers have an extra understanding of the overall sector and industry. They place company fundamentals against the current economic backdrop to determine how a particular stock will fare as an investment.So, when brokers upgrade a stock, you can rely on their judgment. But solely depending on broker upgrades is not a good way to build your investment portfolio. Several other factors should be taken into consideration to ensure steady returns.Selecting the Winning StrategyWe have a screening strategy that will help you in your search for potential winners:Broker Rating Upgrades (Four Weeks) of 1% or More: The screen selects stocks that have witnessed broker rating upgrades of 1% or more over the last four weeks.Current Price Greater Than $5: The stocks must trade above $5.Average 20-Day Volume Greater Than 100,000: A large trading volume guarantees that the stock is easily tradable.Zacks Rank Equal to #1 or 2: Despite good or bad market conditions, stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) have a proven record of success. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.VGM Score of A or B: Our research shows that stocks with a VGM Score of A or B, when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 or 2, offer the best upside potential.Here are three stocks that qualified for the screening:Cincinnati, OH-based Kroger operates supermarkets under banners including Kroger, City Market, Dillons, Food 4 Less, Fred Meyer, Fry's, Harris Teeter, Jay C, King Soopers, Mariano's, Pick 'n Save, QFC, Ralphs and Smith's.

Raytheon declined to comment. Raytheon Technologies sells its Pratt &amp; Whitney aircraft engines, as well as landing gear and controls, to China's commercial aviation industry.Lockheed, which exports to more than 70 countries, said in a statement, ""Foreign Military Sales are government-to-government transactions and we work closely with the U.S. government on any military sales to international customers. Lockheed Martin closely adheres to United States government policy with regard to conducting business with foreign governments.""Lockheed makes the F-22 Raptor fighter jet, which flew the mission to shoot down an alleged Chinese spy balloon off the coast of South Carolina, using the AIM-9X Sidewinder missile made by Raytheon.Beijing also banned the companies from further investment in China, barred senior management from entering the country, canceled residence permits for any staff in China and imposed fines that are double the contracted amounts of their arms sales to Taiwan.Story continuesIt was not clear how China would enforce such fines, which it said must be paid within 15 days.Last February, China sanctioned the two companies over a $100 million arms sale to Taiwan, a self-ruled island which Beijing views as a breakaway province.On at least two previous occasions China has announced sanctions against Lockheed and Raytheon, in 2019 and 2020, though Beijing has not explained what those sanctions entailed or how they were enforced.The U.S. does not sell weapons to China.

Raytheon declined to comment. Raytheon Technologies sells its Pratt &amp; Whitney aircraft engines, as well as landing gear and controls, to China's commercial aviation industry.Lockheed, which exports to more than 70 countries, said in a statement, ""Foreign Military Sales are government-to-government transactions and we work closely with the U.S. government on any military sales to international customers. Lockheed Martin closely adheres to United States government policy with regard to conducting business with foreign governments.""Lockheed makes the F-22 Raptor fighter jet, which flew the mission to shoot down an alleged Chinese spy balloon off the coast of South Carolina, using the AIM-9X Sidewinder missile made by Raytheon.Beijing also banned the companies from further investment in China, barred senior management from entering the country, canceled residence permits for any staff in China and imposed fines that are double the contracted amounts of their arms sales to Taiwan.Story continuesIt was not clear how China would enforce such fines, which it said must be paid within 15 days.Last February, China sanctioned the two companies over a $100 million arms sale to Taiwan, a self-ruled island which Beijing views as a breakaway province.On at least two previous occasions China has announced sanctions against Lockheed and Raytheon, in 2019 and 2020, though Beijing has not explained what those sanctions entailed or how they were enforced.The U.S. does not sell weapons to China. However, the United States is bound by the 1979 Taiwan Relations Act to provide Taiwan with the means to defend itself, and U.S. weapons sales always attract China's anger.(Reporting by Tony Munroe and Laurie ChenEditing by Raissa Kasolowsky and Jonathan Oatis)]"

He is currently serving as the Managing Principle and Co-Chief Investment Officer of the firm.Greenblatt is mainly known for his ‘Magic Formula’ investing technique, which he introduced in his book ‘The Little Book that Still Beats the Market’.

This means that a few large firms play a dominant role. While collectively they comprise an oligopoly, individually they often have monopoly positions in particular narrower segments. Their main counterparty is the US government, a key customer in what is known as a monopsonist position. This is a rather unusual situation, but one that is very advantageous for companies such as LMT. (Click here to see the full text)7.

You can skip our detailed analysis of the early retirement phenomenon and dividend stocks, and go directly to read Early Retirement Portfolio: 5 Stocks to Live Off Dividends. Due to the onset of the pandemic in 2020, early retirement gained a steady pace among Americans. According to a report by New York Times, millennial workers plan to retire in their 50s to pursue their interests. However, their financial condition suggests otherwise. The report showed results from the Global Benefits Attitudes Survey, revealing that 36% of millennial workers were just saving around 5% of their income, which is not sufficient to cover living expenses post-retirement.The financial instability, coupled with growing inflation, has somewhat altered investor sentiment who are now delaying their retirement plans. According to a survey conducted by the Nationwide Retirement Institute, 40% of US workers ages 45 years or above are holding up on their retirement, which is twice the number of workers who asserted the same last year. The survey also mentioned that only 58% of the workers are positive about their retirement plans, down from 74% in 2021. This was also supported by data from Natixis Investment Managers, which highlighted that 58% of high-net-worth individuals plan to work beyond their retirement age due to market uncertainty.As major stocks and bonds fell in 2022, retiree investors are turning to stocks that offer long-term growth and can generate stable income. Over the years, dividend stocks have shown promising performance, becoming investors’ top choices in times of financial instability. Moreover, companies with long dividend growth streaks and positive cash flow generation are also great investment options for retirees. Among these companies are PepsiCo, Inc. (NASDAQ:PEP), AbbVie Inc. (NYSE:ABBV), and Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) who have raised their dividends for decades, even during market turmoil.

Here is what the firm has to say:“Let’s look at The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG). Dividend yield is 2.4%. Earnings are forecasted to grow at 5.9%, and its current earnings multiple is at 25x. Now, lets say over the next 3-5 years the market loses interest in the “safe”, mature companies that grow at anemic rates and gets an appetite for growth again. It’s very unlikely that Mr. Market will be paying 25x for 5.9% earnings growth. Lets assume that multiple declines to the market average of 18x — that would be ~6.9% drag per year on the total expected return over next 3-5 years. If we get 2.4% (dividend) + 5.9% (earnings growth) – 6.9% (decrease in earnings multiple) = 1.4% (annual return we can expect on average from this stock).”11. The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO)Dividend Yield as of February 14: 2.90%The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) has kept its dividends steady during previous inflationary periods.

Its dividend yield is 2.8%, earnings are estimated to grow at only 3.6% rate per year over next 4 years, and its earnings multiple is currently at 24x (based on next years forecasted earnings). KO has an anemic growth, so we can argue that paying 24x earnings is not very attractive. Let’s assume that the multiple will stay constant over the next 3-5 years, thus our expected annual returns will be 2.8%+3.6% = 6.4% (that is below the current reported inflation rate and only slightly above the risk-free rate of 4%).”10.

He founded Gotham Capital in 1985, which delivered an annualized return of 50% from 1985 to 1994. In 2008, Greenblatt created Gotham Asset Management as the successor to his previous fund. He is currently serving as the Managing Principle and Co-Chief Investment Officer of the firm.Greenblatt is mainly known for his ‘Magic Formula’ investing technique, which he introduced in his book ‘The Little Book that Still Beats the Market’. This technique takes its inspiration from Buffett/Graham's value approach. According to this strategy, investors should focus on high-quality companies with cheap valuations and strong fundamentals. The strategy further elaborates that through return on capital employed (ROCE) and earnings yield investors can find a great combination of quality and cheap value stocks.Over the years, Joel Greenblatt’s investment technique has resulted in his hedge fund delivering solid returns to shareholders. Over the past three years, Gotham Large Value Fund (GVALX) has gained 10.6%, compared with a 9.88% return of the S&amp;P 500.As of the close of Q4 2022, Gotham Asset Management holds a 13F portfolio value of over $3.5 billion, compared with $3.3 billion in the previous quarter.

If you want to see more most profitable dividend stocks, go directly to 5 Most Profitable Dividend Stocks.Dividend stocks are stocks of companies that pay dividends.Many dividend stocks pay a dividend quarterly as a way to return excess capital back to shareholders. Companies can also use stock repurchases as another way to return excess capital back to shareholders. For those you interested check out 15 Companies That Are Buying Back Their Stock.When company profits rise, many companies tend to pay slightly higher dividends. When company profits decrease, many companies also decrease or even suspend their dividends.Considering the change in tax laws for stock repurchases beginning in 2023 given the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022, dividends could be slightly more attractive. As a result, some companies might be more inclined to return slightly more capital back to shareholders through dividends than stock repurchases.Jones Day describes the effect of the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022, ""U.S. (and in certain instances, non-U.S.) corporations, whose stock is traded on an established securities market, that undertake share repurchases of more than $1 million in the aggregate per tax year, will be subject to a 1% share excise tax on the value of any share repurchase unless such share repurchase is taxed as a dividend (other exceptions and exclusions may apply).""While the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 could affect dividend payments slightly, the largest determination of how much capital companies return through dividends will still likely be how much the companies make in profits in the near term and how much excess capital management of companies think they have.If there is a possibility of an economic slowdown or even a recession in the future, many companies may not raise their dividends even if their profits increase. If the economic slowdown or recession occurs, many companies will likely cut or even suspend their dividends.Story continuesIn terms of the possibility of an economic slowdown or a recession, the probability will depend on economic developments and how much further the Federal Reserve raises interest rates.Although inflation has cooled from their 2022 highs late last year, the Federal Reserve has indicated that it will raise rates further. If the U.S. central bank raises interest rates too much, there is potential for an economic slowdown or even a recession. If that happens, demand will soften for a lot of companies and company profits could decline.Given the uncertainty, it could be a good idea for long term investors to own a well diversified portfolio of leading stocks across many different sectors.Building, Real estate, HoldingMethodologyFor our list of 15 Most Profitable Dividend Stocks, we used the Fortune 500 list to find the most profitable American companies and we then filtered the list to find the stocks that paid dividends and that were profitable according to YCharts in terms of net income for the trailing twelve months.Because we used YCharts data, the net income may not be the same as adjusted profit.For some stocks, the trailing twelve months isn't the same time period as it for others given some stocks have not reported their fourth quarter earnings results yet.15 Most Profitable Dividend Stocks15.

The current company was formed through various mergers including NationsBank, FleetBoston, US Trust, Countrywide Financial, and Merrill Lynch with the legacy commercial bank to form a national banking powerhouse and bulge bracket investment firm. As one of the ‘Big Four’ U.S. banks it enjoys scale driven cost advantages and economies of scale which provide meaningful competitive advantages and potential for strong returns in the largely commoditized banking industry. A survivor of the financial crisis, BAC has emerged with a solid capital base and stands to benefit from a rising interest rate environment.6. Pfizer Inc.

For more stocks, head on over to Mario Gabelli Stock Picks for 2023: Top 5.GAMCO Investors, Inc. is an American hedge fund that is headquartered in Rye, New York. It is one of the largest investment institutions in the world, with a total of $9.2 billion of stock market investments as of the fourth quarter of last year (for the biggest hedge funds in the world, head on over to 15 Biggest Hedge Funds in the World by AUM). The fund is managed by Mr. Mario J. Gabelli, who is its chief executive officer. Mr. Gabelli set up GAMCO, previously known as Gabelli Asset Management Company, in 1976, and has been running it since then, giving him decades of experience in the finance industry.2022 has been a year of significant economic turmoil, and as we enter 2023, institutions and investors all over are sharing their thoughts on what to expect. For instance, investment bank The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. (NYSE:GS) is one of the more optimistic analysts right now, as it believes that the ever dreaded recession that is being speculated since the mid of last year might be avoided. Mr. Gabelli also has a take on the current situation, and in an interview with CNBC he mirrored sentiments that while the first half of this year will be turbulent, investors can expect the market to take off in 2024. His research comes from the proverbial horse's mouth, as the investor outlined:""A year from now, Joe [laughs], it's gonna be 2024 and the opportunities a year later are gonna be terrific. But short term, what I'm learning from visiting companies, listening to meetings, reading the dynamics, one, goods are becoming more available, but more importantly, the managements have learned how to deal with pass throughs, how to deal with inflation, how to deal with currency, how to deal with the balance sheet and interest rates. And they're learning the inelastic questions about the demand for their products. Now from my point of view revenue's gonna be quite okay this year in nominal terms. Gross margins are going to be challenged short term for the manufacturing sector. SG&amp;A, kind of held in check, and then the question is taxes, we talked about, there's a 15% tax on booked profits, that's kinda gotta be worked out. Bottom line, I think that things are okay, but there's going to be a lot of tension in the first half of the year in the markets.""Story continuesNaturally, his insight merits a deeper look at GAMCO Investors' latest investments, out of which the top three are Herc Holdings Inc.

Today's Research Daily features new research reports on 16 major stocks, including Merck &amp; Co., Inc. (MRK), Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc. (TMO) and American Express Co. (AXP). These research reports have been hand-picked from the roughly 70 reports published by our analyst team today.You can see all of today’s research reports here &gt;&gt;&gt;Merck’s shares have outperformed the Zacks Large Cap Pharmaceuticals industry over the past year (+39.8% vs. +11.8%). Drugs like Keytruda and Gardasil (HPV vaccine) have been driving sales. With continued label expansion into new indications &amp; early-stage settings, Keytruda is expected to remain a key top-line driver.Animal health and vaccine products are core growth drivers. Its new COVID oral antiviral pill, Lagevrio, has become a key top-line driver in 2022. Merck boasts a strong cancer pipeline, including Keytruda, which should help drive long-term growth.However, generic competition for several drugs and rising competitive pressure, mainly on the diabetes franchise, will continue to be overhangs on the top line. There are concerns about Merck’s ability to grow its non-oncology business ahead of Keytruda’s loss of exclusivity later in the decade.(You can read the full research report on Merck here &gt;&gt;&gt;)Shares of Thermo Fisher Scientific have outperformed the Zacks Medical - Instruments industry over the past year (+2.7% vs. -12.0%). The company’s robust year-over-year revenue growth in the Analytical Instruments and the Laboratory Products and Biopharma Services segments appears promising.Thermo Fisher’s accelerated investments to expand bioproduction capacity also buoy optimism. In the quarter, Thermo Fisher witnessed strength in three out of its four end markets. The upbeat guidance for 2022 is indicative that this growth momentum will continue.However, the year-over-year decline in revenues in the Life Science Solutions and Specialty Diagnostics segment is disappointing. The contraction of both margins on escalating costs and expenses does not bode well either. The year-over-year decline in adjusted earnings is concerning.(You can read the full research report on Thermo Fisher Scientific here &gt;&gt;&gt;)Shares of American Express have declined -8.6% over the past year against the Zacks Financial - Miscellaneous Services industry’s decline of -17.7%. Due to higher utilization of the company’s cards, expense in the form of card member services and card member rewards is likely to go up and strain the company's margins. Also, marketing and business development expenses are expected to rise, hurting the bottom line. As such, the stock warrants a cautious stance.Nevertheless, American Express have adopted several growth initiatives, such as launching new products, enhancing existing features, reaching new agreements and forging alliances, are boosting its revenues. Consumer spending on travel and entertainment, which carry higher margins for AmEx, is advancing well.The company’s balance sheet looks strong with manageable debt.

Also, strategic acquisitions like Virtual Clarity and Bluleader are a positive.Cirrus Logic (CRUS) Benefits From Strong Product PortfolioPer the Zacks analyst, Cirrus Logic's performance benefitted from strong revenue growth across all business segments.

165,949ba865-521d-3e48-b756-b4a39fe2f70d,WMB,2023-02-16,Williams (WMB) to Report Q4 Earnings: What's in Store?,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/williams-wmb-report-q4-earnings-154703632.html,1676476023,STORY,"['WMB', 'PARR', 'PUMP', 'LNG']","[The Williams Companies, Inc. WMB is set to release fourth-quarter results on Feb 20. The current Zacks Consensus Estimate for the to-be-reported quarter is a profit of 47 cents per share on revenues of $3.2 billion.Let’s delve into the factors that might have influenced the oil and gas pipeline operator’s performance in the December quarter. But it’s worth taking a look at Williams’ previous-quarter results first.Highlights of Q3 Earnings &amp; Surprise HistoryIn the last reported quarter, the energy infrastructure provider beat the consensus mark on strong performance across its core businesses. Williams had reported adjusted earnings per share of 48 cents, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 44 cents. Revenues of $3 billion generated by the firm also came 5.4% above the consensus mark.WMB beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings in each of the last four quarters, resulting in an earnings surprise of 14.2%, on average. This is depicted in the graph below: Williams Companies, Inc. (The) Price and EPS SurpriseWilliams Companies, Inc. (The) Price and EPS SurpriseWilliams Companies, Inc. (The) price-eps-surprise | Williams Companies, Inc. (The) Quote Trend in Estimate RevisionThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for the fourth-quarter bottom line has remained the same in the past seven days. The estimated figure indicates a 20.5% improvement year over year. However, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues suggests a 2.4% decrease from the year-ago period.Factors to ConsiderWilliams’ Transmission &amp; Gulf of Mexico segment — which includes the company’s crown jewel and the nation’s largest and fastest-growing natural gas pipeline system Transco — is expected to have generated robust profits in the fourth quarter.The unit is likely to have benefited from expansion projects around Transco being placed into service over the past few years and additional volumes from its infrastructure on the back of strong drilling activity. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the segment’s adjusted EBITDA is pegged at $697 million for the to-be-reported quarter, up from the prior-year period’s level of $685 million.The Northeast G&amp;P unit — engaged in natural gas gathering and processing along with the NGL fractionation business in Marcellus and Utica shale regions — is also expected to have done well in the to-be-reported quarter. Echoing the segment’s healthy dynamics, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter’s adjusted EBITDA is projected at $465 million. The number suggests a $6 million increase from a profit of $459 million reported in the year-ago quarter.On a somewhat bearish note, the increase in Williams’ costs might have dented the company’s to-be-reported bottom line. WMB’s total costs in the third quarter were $2.2 billion, nearly 4% higher than the prior-year period. The upward cost trajectory is likely to have continued in the fourth quarter due to the prevailing inflationary environment.Story continuesWhat Does Our Model Say?The proven Zacks model does not conclusively show that Williams Companies is likely to beat estimates in the fourth quarter. The combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) increases the chances of beating estimates.

No damage or injuries were reported.United referred questions about the incident to the NTSB.Acting FAA Administrator Billy Nolen said a spate of recent airline incidents have prompted him to order a safety team review and hold a safety summit next month.NTSB chair Jennifer Homendy said last week in an interview that the board has opened investigations into 18 runway incursion incidents since 2013, including two from last summer that remain under investigation.Last week, Homendy said a FedEx Boeing 767 cargo plane and a Southwest Airlines 737-700 that nearly collided on Feb. 4 in Austin, Texas were ""probably under 100 feet (30.5 meters) vertically from each other.""The FedEx plane had been set to land on a runway on which a Southwest Airlines jet was also cleared to depart. Homendy said it could have resulted in ""terrible tragedy.""Homendy said it was too early to say if there was any trend among the recent runway incursion incidents but she noted ""it just takes one"" to have a devastating tragedy.Homendy said another runway incursion last month at New York's John F. Kennedy Airport in which a Delta Air Lines plane came to a safe stop after air traffic controllers noticed an American Airlines Boeing 777 had crossed from an adjacent taxiway could also have been tragic.Story continuesOn Friday, the NTSB issued subpoenas to the American Airlines flight crew after they refused to be interviewed on the basis their statements would be recorded for transcription.A spokesman for the Allied Pilots Association union said on Wednesday that the ""pilots intend to appear for their interviews in accordance with the subpoenas.""The NTSB on Tuesday said it would investigate a Dec. 18 incident in which another United 777 lost altitude and came within about 800 feet of the Pacific Ocean before recovering shortly after departing Kahului, Hawaii.

Its activity is responsible for eliminating cellular stress and maintaining appropriate energy balance. Her scientific advisory board member, Dr. Nobutaka Hattori, was the genetic pioneer who identified the Parkin gene, which provides the instructions to make the Parkin protein. Without this gene and protein, cellular stress goes unchecked, leading to loss of cellular energy, chemical imbalance, and cellular death and disease.""NysnoBio is focused on the most common cause of early-onset Parkinson's disease,"" Johnston says. ""If you are missing this gene, it is 100 percent certain that you will get Parkinson's disease before the age of 45."" Her team is seeking a therapy to replace the gene in people who are missing it, to arrest progression of the disease in patients.Gene therapy all-starsJohnston has studied the causes of early-onset Parkinson's disease for over 20 years. She's a long-standing member of The Michael J. Fox Foundation, and she directed the Parkinson's program at Elan Pharmaceuticals before launching her own company.NysnoBio is staffed with gene therapy and neurosurgery experts; when Johnston first approached industry and academic colleagues about joining her to explore gene therapy, they jumped aboard. ""My team is a dream,"" she says. ""Most of them focused their lives on Parkinson's disease, early-onset patients, and making therapeutics; and are now providing their expertise on topics as diverse as neurosurgery, human genetics, and manufacturing for complicated biologic protein therapeutics like gene therapies. Our approach is to directly deliver the normal Parkin gene to the area of the brain that, for those with Parkinson's disease, is dying. It's a very simple, straightforward, and pragmatic approach, and while no one has done this before, my team probably has the most experience in this form of the disease.""Story continuesWhile working with an academic group, Johnston was awarded a three-year grant from Aligning Sciences Across Parkinson's (ASAP), an initiative supported by the Sergey Brin Family Foundation in collaboration with The Michael J. Fox Foundation. The grant is funding research into the possibility of using transplanted brain cells from a healthy person to cure a patient with Parkinson's disease.No mutation is alikeIn their studies, the NysnoBio team sought to go beyond the usual process of collecting cells from patients, analyzing them, and-with any luck-reaching a big conclusion about the cohort for a published paper.""The challenge for these types of studies,"" Johnston says, ""is that when you get cells from different individuals who may all share a common Parkinson's mutation, they could have vast differences in mutations across the rest of their genome. While Parkin is the most common early-onset genetic mutation, there are more than 15 genes that can lead to Parkinson's disease. Parkin is 100% penetrant, which means if you have mutations in Parkin it is 100% certain you will get the disease. For other genetic mutations, that is not the case; other dominant mutations are ""incomplete penetrance,"" meaning other genetic factors strongly influence whether someone will actually get the disease at all, and whether they get it early in life or during old age.""For our ASAP project, we are studying all genetic forms of Parkinson's disease-both penetrant and incompletely penetrant mutations. So when we get cells from a patient who has an incomplete penetrance genetic form, we cannot make any conclusions about how those cells behave until we have a complete whole-genome sequence (WGS) from those cells, because we need to understand the influence of the ‘background mutations' before we can attribute any cellular effects to a Parkinson's disease mutation. For the 100% penetrant genes, like Parkin, the background is not as important, but we still want to make sure we capture that WGS information.""Studying cell behavior requires an understanding of the entire genome, and Johnston cautions against making assumptions about a mutation based on any single behavior it exhibits. ""If I get 10 samples of one mutation from 10 different patients, they're all going to have different genetic backgrounds; they may behave differently. We're trying to use the sequencing power that Illumina brings to light so we can understand the whole genome of all our samples-why some behave the same, and some behave differently.""Many research groups are already working with induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) to develop models of Parkinson's disease, yet each group has its own patient-derived cell lines and utilizes genetic manipulations and programming techniques which may unknowingly alter the genome. When one compares these cell lines, the phenotypic data is inconsistent between them.NysnoBio is an early adopter of Illumina Connected Analytics bioinformatics platform and Cohorts, a module in Connected Analytics for rapidly building and exploring study cohorts. This tool helps them aggregate cell line genomic and phenotypic data. It also provides analytics for whole-genome sequencing data, which they can use to identify genetic variants, and in turn distinguish between different disease subtypes.""What's really unique and amazing about Illumina Connected Analytics and Cohorts is that it's going to allow us to bring together all the data that people are generating from these human cells from patients with Parkinson's disease,"" Johnston says. ""We'll be able to understand their genetic background in a comprehensive way that we never have before. Add in machine learning, and we'll be able to look for patterns in our data and in the genes.""The ability to obtain precise genetic information has helped Johnston before. While working on a project to understand the role of the Parkin protein in suppressing cancer, she frequently relied on two extensive databases of cancer cells studied with WGS-canSAR in the UK, and The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) in the US-which allowed her to determine which cells she wanted to use for her experiments. ""I thought, ‘We definitely need to do this for Parkinson's disease. It's so powerful, it saves so much time, and it unifies the field.'"" Johnston says.Once NysnoBio's grant from ASAP is complete, Johnston hopes their findings will become a powerful resource (like canSAR or TCGA) to share with the Parkinson's disease community. ""It can help us to compare and contrast the experimental effects of people who were previously lumped into one genotype,"" she says. ""We can understand how additional mutations in each person's genome impact the presence of the Parkinson's disease manifestations-leading to a more personalized medicine.""I think it's also going to be a way to bring researchers together, because it's not everyone just in their lab by themselves with their cells,"" she says. ""Soon, they can put their information in this interactive database-and those are things no one's ever been able to do before. So I'm very excited about the capability of Cohorts to help us understand our data better.""Pattern recognition""The challenge for neuroscience therapeutic development is that it's unlike cancer-you can't take a biopsy. So how do you know something's working?"" Johnston says. Today, the NysnoBio team is working on a neural network imaging study in Parkinson's patients. ""When you use glucose in the brain, you can use imaging technology to see which neurons are using the glucose,"" Johnston says. ""In healthy patients, they use groups of neurons in one way; and in Parkinson's patients, the brain must enlist alternative groups of neurons to maintain function after neurons are lost in disease. In studying our early-onset patients, we can determine these alternative patterns. The goal for our therapeutic in development is that we'll be able to restore the alternative pattern back to normal.Before a patient is enrolled in a clinical study, the NysnoBio team can have that patient's genome sequenced, assess whether they have the specific Parkinson's mutation, and determine background mutations that may influence how the patient will respond to therapy. Having the WGS data helps the team identify genetic factors that can influence patient phenotype: How does their disease look? How fast does it progress? And how well do they respond to the therapy? The answers-and perhaps the cure-are waiting in our cells.More on Parkinson's in our genomics research hub: Using DRAGEN for Gaucher and Parkinson disease research: resolving GBA1 variants using PCR-free whole-genome sequencing.Illumina, Wednesday, February 15, 2023, Press release pictureJennifer Johnston, co-founder and CEO of NysnoBio | Photo: David SteeleView additional multimedia and more ESG storytelling from Illumina on 3blmedia.com.Contact Info:Spokesperson: IlluminaWebsite: https://www.3blmedia.com/profiles/illuminaEmail: info@3blmedia.comSOURCE: IlluminaView source version on accesswire.com: https://www.accesswire.com/739465/Using-Whole-Genome-Sequencing-To-Study-Early-Onset-Parkinsons-Disease]"

(NYSE:TEL) will increase its dividend from last year's comparable payment on the 3rd of March to $0.56. This makes the dividend yield about the same as the industry average at 1.7%. View our latest analysis for TE Connectivity TE Connectivity's Payment Has Solid Earnings CoverageWe aren't too impressed by dividend yields unless they can be sustained over time. However, prior to this announcement, TE Connectivity's dividend was comfortably covered by both cash flow and earnings. This means that most of what the business earns is being used to help it grow.The next year is set to see EPS grow by 20.4%. If the dividend continues along recent trends, we estimate the payout ratio will be 28%, which is in the range that makes us comfortable with the sustainability of the dividend.historic-dividendTE Connectivity Has A Solid Track RecordThe company has a sustained record of paying dividends with very little fluctuation. Since 2013, the annual payment back then was $0.72, compared to the most recent full-year payment of $2.24. This implies that the company grew its distributions at a yearly rate of about 12% over that duration. It is good to see that there has been strong dividend growth, and that there haven't been any cuts for a long time.The Dividend Looks Likely To GrowThe company's investors will be pleased to have been receiving dividend income for some time. We are encouraged to see that TE Connectivity has grown earnings per share at 18% per year over the past five years. With a decent amount of growth and a low payout ratio, we think this bodes well for TE Connectivity's prospects of growing its dividend payments in the future.We Really Like TE Connectivity's DividendIn summary, it is always positive to see the dividend being increased, and we are particularly pleased with its overall sustainability. Earnings are easily covering distributions, and the company is generating plenty of cash. All in all, this checks a lot of the boxes we look for when choosing an income stock.Story continuesIt's important to note that companies having a consistent dividend policy will generate greater investor confidence than those having an erratic one. Meanwhile, despite the importance of dividend payments, they are not the only factors our readers should know when assessing a company.

Corporation (VFC) Is a Trending Stock: Facts to Know Before Betting on It,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/v-f-corporation-vfc-trending-140002991.html,1676469602,STORY,['VFC'],"[V.F. (VFC) is one of the stocks most watched by Zacks.com visitors lately. So, it might be a good idea to review some of the factors that might affect the near-term performance of the stock.Over the past month, shares of this maker of brands such as Vans, North Face and Timberland have returned -9.8%, compared to the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's +3.5% change. During this period, the Zacks Textile - Apparel industry, which V.F. falls in, has lost 2.7%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?Although media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.Revisions to Earnings EstimatesRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.Our analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.For the current quarter, V.F. is expected to post earnings of $0.16 per share, indicating a change of -64.4% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -46.7% over the last 30 days.The consensus earnings estimate of $2.09 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of -34.3%. This estimate has changed -0.3% over the last 30 days.Story continuesFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $2.22 indicates a change of +6.2% from what V.F. is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -5.5%.Having a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, V.F. is rated Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPS12-month consensus EPS estimate for VFC _12MonthEPSChartUrlRevenue Growth ForecastEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.In the case of V.F. the consensus sales estimate of $2.74 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of -3%. The $11.6 billion and $12.05 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of -2% and +3.9%, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryV.F. reported revenues of $3.53 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -2.6%. EPS of $1.12 for the same period compares with $1.35 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $3.49 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +1.14%. The EPS surprise was +13.13%.Over the last four quarters, the company surpassed EPS estimates just once. The company topped consensus revenue estimates three times over this period.ValuationNo investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.Comparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.As part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.V.F. is graded B on this front, indicating that it is trading at a discount to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.ConclusionThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about V.F. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

If you want to see more most profitable dividend stocks, go directly to 5 Most Profitable Dividend Stocks.Dividend stocks are stocks of companies that pay dividends.Many dividend stocks pay a dividend quarterly as a way to return excess capital back to shareholders. Companies can also use stock repurchases as another way to return excess capital back to shareholders. For those you interested check out 15 Companies That Are Buying Back Their Stock.When company profits rise, many companies tend to pay slightly higher dividends. When company profits decrease, many companies also decrease or even suspend their dividends.Considering the change in tax laws for stock repurchases beginning in 2023 given the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022, dividends could be slightly more attractive. As a result, some companies might be more inclined to return slightly more capital back to shareholders through dividends than stock repurchases.Jones Day describes the effect of the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022, ""U.S. (and in certain instances, non-U.S.) corporations, whose stock is traded on an established securities market, that undertake share repurchases of more than $1 million in the aggregate per tax year, will be subject to a 1% share excise tax on the value of any share repurchase unless such share repurchase is taxed as a dividend (other exceptions and exclusions may apply).""While the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 could affect dividend payments slightly, the largest determination of how much capital companies return through dividends will still likely be how much the companies make in profits in the near term and how much excess capital management of companies think they have.If there is a possibility of an economic slowdown or even a recession in the future, many companies may not raise their dividends even if their profits increase. If the economic slowdown or recession occurs, many companies will likely cut or even suspend their dividends.Story continuesIn terms of the possibility of an economic slowdown or a recession, the probability will depend on economic developments and how much further the Federal Reserve raises interest rates.Although inflation has cooled from their 2022 highs late last year, the Federal Reserve has indicated that it will raise rates further. If the U.S. central bank raises interest rates too much, there is potential for an economic slowdown or even a recession. If that happens, demand will soften for a lot of companies and company profits could decline.Given the uncertainty, it could be a good idea for long term investors to own a well diversified portfolio of leading stocks across many different sectors.Building, Real estate, HoldingMethodologyFor our list of 15 Most Profitable Dividend Stocks, we used the Fortune 500 list to find the most profitable American companies and we then filtered the list to find the stocks that paid dividends and that were profitable according to YCharts in terms of net income for the trailing twelve months.Because we used YCharts data, the net income may not be the same as adjusted profit.For some stocks, the trailing twelve months isn't the same time period as it for others given some stocks have not reported their fourth quarter earnings results yet.15 Most Profitable Dividend Stocks15.

(NYSE: PFE) today announced publication of results in The Lancet Neurology from the Phase 3 pivotal clinical trial of zavegepant, an investigational calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) receptor antagonist nasal spray for the acute treatment of migraine. The study met its co-primary endpoints, showing that a single 10 mg dose of zavegepant was more effective than placebo for both pain freedom and freedom from the most bothersome symptom (MBS) at two hours post-dose. Additionally, zavegepant demonstrated relief from migraine pain in 15 minutes, with relief lasting up to 48 hours for many patients. Zavegepant was well tolerated, and there were no serious adverse events reported in treated participants.""The results from this study demonstrate zavegepant’s potential as an effective acute nasal spray treatment for migraine, a neurological disorder that affects more than one billion people worldwide,"" said Richard B. Lipton, M.D., Lead Author, Department of Neurology at the Albert Einstein College of Medicine. ""This was the first Phase 3 clinical trial of a non-oral CGRP receptor antagonist developed for the acute treatment of migraine in adults. With this evidence of sustained treatment benefits, good tolerability and an alternative administration method, I believe zavegepant has the potential to fill an important gap in the available options for the acute treatment of migraine.""In the trial, 1,405 people were randomized to receive a single 10 mg dose of either zavegepant or placebo. Participants historically experienced two to eight moderate or severe migraine attacks per month, and their untreated attacks lasted a mean of 30.8 hours. During the study, participants recorded their migraine headache pain intensity based on a four-point scale, identified their current MBS associated with migraine (selected from phonophobia, photophobia or nausea) and recorded their level of functional disability immediately before dosing the treated attack and at various intervals post-dose.Story continuesZavegepant was demonstrated to be effective in the acute treatment of migraine, as measured by superiority to placebo on the co-primary efficacy endpoints of pain freedom (24% vs 15%, P&lt;0·0001) and freedom from the MBS (40% vs 31%, P=0·0012) at two hours post-dose. Additionally, zavegepant was more effective than placebo on 13 of the 17 secondary endpoints, including treatment benefits for pain relief beginning as early as 15 minutes and sustained pain relief from two through 48 hours post-dose. On the 14th endpoint, return to normal function at 15 minutes post-dose, the difference between zavegepant and placebo was not significant. Consequently, in keeping with the analysis plan, the remaining secondary endpoints were not formally tested. Treatment with zavegepant was also associated with higher rates of return to normal functional ability at 30 minutes post treatment and two hours.Zavegepant was well tolerated in this study. The most common adverse events (AE) in either treatment group (≥2%) were dysgeusia (an altered sense of taste), occurring in 20.5% of zavegepant patients as compared to 4.7% of patients on placebo, nasal discomfort, occurring in 3.7% of zavegepant patients as compared to 0.8% of patients on placebo, and nausea, occurring in 3.2% of zavegepant patients and 1.1% of patients on placebo. The AE safety profile was consistent with earlier studies of zavegepant. There were no serious AEs reported in treated participants, and no signal of hepatotoxicity due to zavegepant was identified in the trial.""The intranasal formulation for zavegepant embodies breakthrough innovation in patient-centric drug development,"" said James Rusnak, M.D., Ph.D., Senior Vice President, Chief Development Officer, Internal Medicine and Hospital, Global Product Development, Pfizer. ""If approved by the FDA, zavegepant has the potential to be a significant new treatment option for people with migraine, particularly those who desire fast-acting relief or would benefit from an alternative delivery method. We are excited by the momentum the publication of these study results offers, as we anticipate potentially bringing a new medical breakthrough to millions of people suffering from migraine in the U.S.""About ZavegepantZavegepant is a third generation, high affinity, selective and structurally unique, small molecule CGRP receptor antagonist and the only CGRP receptor antagonist in clinical development with both intranasal and oral formulations. The New Drug Application (NDA) was filed for intranasal zavegepant with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for the acute treatment of migraine in adults. The Prescription Drug User Fee Act (PDUFA) goal date for completion of the FDA review of the NDA is set for 1Q2023.About MigraineNearly 40 million people in the U.S. suffer from migraine1 and the World Health Organization classifies migraine as one of the 10 most disabling medical illnesses.2 Migraine is characterized by debilitating attacks lasting four to 72 hours with multiple symptoms, including pulsating headaches of moderate to severe pain intensity that can be associated with nausea or vomiting, and/or sensitivity to sound (phonophobia) and sensitivity to light (photophobia).3About CGRP Receptor AntagonismSmall molecule CGRP receptor antagonists represent a novel class of drugs for the treatment of migraine. For acute treatment, this unique mode of action potentially offers an alternative to other agents, particularly for patients who have contraindications to the use of triptans or who have a poor response to triptans or are intolerant to them. CGRP signal-blocking therapies have not been associated with medication overuse headache (MOH) or rebound headaches which can limit the clinical utility of other acute treatments.About Pfizer: Breakthroughs That Change Patients’ LivesAt Pfizer, we apply science and our global resources to bring therapies to people that extend and significantly improve their lives. We strive to set the standard for quality, safety and value in the discovery, development and manufacture of health care products, including innovative medicines and vaccines.

He founded Gotham Capital in 1985, which delivered an annualized return of 50% from 1985 to 1994. In 2008, Greenblatt created Gotham Asset Management as the successor to his previous fund. He is currently serving as the Managing Principle and Co-Chief Investment Officer of the firm.Greenblatt is mainly known for his ‘Magic Formula’ investing technique, which he introduced in his book ‘The Little Book that Still Beats the Market’. This technique takes its inspiration from Buffett/Graham's value approach. According to this strategy, investors should focus on high-quality companies with cheap valuations and strong fundamentals. The strategy further elaborates that through return on capital employed (ROCE) and earnings yield investors can find a great combination of quality and cheap value stocks.Over the years, Joel Greenblatt’s investment technique has resulted in his hedge fund delivering solid returns to shareholders.

If you want to see more most profitable dividend stocks, go directly to 5 Most Profitable Dividend Stocks.Dividend stocks are stocks of companies that pay dividends.Many dividend stocks pay a dividend quarterly as a way to return excess capital back to shareholders. Companies can also use stock repurchases as another way to return excess capital back to shareholders. For those you interested check out 15 Companies That Are Buying Back Their Stock.When company profits rise, many companies tend to pay slightly higher dividends. When company profits decrease, many companies also decrease or even suspend their dividends.Considering the change in tax laws for stock repurchases beginning in 2023 given the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022, dividends could be slightly more attractive. As a result, some companies might be more inclined to return slightly more capital back to shareholders through dividends than stock repurchases.Jones Day describes the effect of the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022, ""U.S. (and in certain instances, non-U.S.) corporations, whose stock is traded on an established securities market, that undertake share repurchases of more than $1 million in the aggregate per tax year, will be subject to a 1% share excise tax on the value of any share repurchase unless such share repurchase is taxed as a dividend (other exceptions and exclusions may apply).""While the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 could affect dividend payments slightly, the largest determination of how much capital companies return through dividends will still likely be how much the companies make in profits in the near term and how much excess capital management of companies think they have.If there is a possibility of an economic slowdown or even a recession in the future, many companies may not raise their dividends even if their profits increase. If the economic slowdown or recession occurs, many companies will likely cut or even suspend their dividends.Story continuesIn terms of the possibility of an economic slowdown or a recession, the probability will depend on economic developments and how much further the Federal Reserve raises interest rates.Although inflation has cooled from their 2022 highs late last year, the Federal Reserve has indicated that it will raise rates further. If the U.S. central bank raises interest rates too much, there is potential for an economic slowdown or even a recession. If that happens, demand will soften for a lot of companies and company profits could decline.Given the uncertainty, it could be a good idea for long term investors to own a well diversified portfolio of leading stocks across many different sectors.Building, Real estate, HoldingMethodologyFor our list of 15 Most Profitable Dividend Stocks, we used the Fortune 500 list to find the most profitable American companies and we then filtered the list to find the stocks that paid dividends and that were profitable according to YCharts in terms of net income for the trailing twelve months.Because we used YCharts data, the net income may not be the same as adjusted profit.For some stocks, the trailing twelve months isn't the same time period as it for others given some stocks have not reported their fourth quarter earnings results yet.15 Most Profitable Dividend Stocks15.

Is there any common thread between this story and Rupert Murdoch and the succession there and News Corp and the merger, which has now been called off?JAMES STEWART: Well, this book has been compared to the TV series ""Succession."" And having been watching it and I love it, it is clearly an amalgam of material taken from the Murdoch family, some taken from Sumner Redstone. But for some reason, in these big media companies, in particularly, succession is a huge issue. I mean, it's cropped up at Disney just recently. Look, they got rid of the chief executive. They had to bring Iger back.The Murdoch family is struggling to figure out how to do that. The unbelievable battle that went on here at Paramount Global, there does seem to be something about the spotlight that is on these media companies. And maybe it's just the sheer-- the glamor, the power, the fun, whatever people think it is. Nobody wants to give these up once they're in the leadership positions.On the other hand, if you think running one of these companies is going to make you happy or making the billions that Sumner Redstone did, this is a case study in how immense wealth does not bring happiness or peace of mind.DAVE BRIGGS: Yeah, no, thanks.JAMES STEWART: No.ALLIE CANAL: Yeah, and you mentioned Disney and Bob Iger what do you think will be key in that succession plan in order for it to not go horribly wrong like the last time?JAMES STEWART: Well, he said he's leaving in two years.ALLIE CANAL: Allegedly.JAMES STEWART: Allegedly.ALLIE CANAL: We'll see.JAMES STEWART: And I have to say that I don't know that there are many people that take that strictly at face value because it's two years isn't very long. And that's a massive company. If he hadn't groomed a successor before, it may take longer than two years. There are some talented people working there, but no obvious candidate to step in as soon as two years. AndStory continuesI mean, I tip my hat to Iger. He's a master of communication. Wall Street loves him. Already, the stock has gone up quite a bit. He managed to stand down the latest proxy challenge from Nelson Peltz. So it'll be really interesting to see what he can do there. But again, Disney, Paramount Global, even Netflix and Amazon, they're all facing the same fundamental issues, which is streaming so far has not proven to be a profitable business, except for the people making the streaming content.DAVE BRIGGS: Yeah, that's a difficult road. So he says he's going to-- Iger-- stay two years. Elon Musk now says he's going to stay at least through the end of this year at Twitter. He sat with Rupert Murdoch at the Super Bowl, if there's a common thread there. How do you think that story plays itself out at Twitter? Does anyone want to work for Elon?JAMES STEWART: Well, I will say this for Elon at Twitter. At least it has calmed down after the unbelievable chaos that was running rampant there. I just-- look, I'm not going to count the Musk out. The previous formula was not really working there. And although he's taken some really drastic measures, chopping the personnel, he is getting the costs down. The advertisers have fled, but will they come back? I wouldn't want to bet against him.DAVE BRIGGS: And you hear that a lot. He's done pretty well with Tesla and with SpaceX and most other things he's touched. Allie Canal, thank you. James Stewart. The book is ""Unscripted."" Check it out, some incredible storytelling. Great to see you, sir. Thank you.JAMES STEWART: Thank you.]"

Many other companies which sell BNPL loans said in submissions that they supported minimal or self-regulation.The $88 billion company supported ""a tailored, proportionate and thoughtful regulatory framework for the BNPL sector via the National Consumer Credit Protection Act to achieve the Government's objective to deliver greater consumer protections"", PayPal said in the submission, signed by its Australia General Manager Andrew Toon.BNPL companies attract shoppers by charging no interest and make money from retailer fees. The absence of interest charges has exempted them from consumer credit law, and the sector's business exploded in an online shopping frenzy spurred by COVID-19 stimulus payments and ultra-low bank interest rates.PayPal's submission said it supported mandatory credit licences for BNPL providers and rules requiring the companies to check a user's suitability for a loan above an ""appropriate threshold"".The company saw ""merit in further consideration of the development of a bespoke BNPL credit reporting framework"" without the full ""costs typically associated with engaging in the credit reporting regime"".Story continuesAustralia's biggest BNPL company Afterpay, bought in 2022 by Twitter founder Jack Dorsey's Block Inc, said in its submission that BNPL companies should have to follow an industry-run code of conduct and ""the status quo has demonstrated its ability to prevent consumer harm"".The Australian Securities and Investments Commission, in its submission, called for the BNPL sector to be subjected to consumer protection law since ""credit products with similar characteristics and the same purpose and function should be treated the same way"".The government has said it wants BNPL regulation in place in 2023. Assistant Treasurer Stephen Jones said Australia had 7 million active BNPL accounts - one for every four people - and the government was committed to ""getting the right balance in competition, innovation and consumer protection"".(Reporting by Byron Kaye; Editing by Christopher Cushing)]"

For one thing, that refund isn’t really that. Instead, it’s the amount you overpaid in taxes. Thus, it amounts to an interest-free loan that you gave Uncle Sam so don’t get too happy about it.Second, the average tax “refund” amounted to $3,176 in 2022. While many families could see smaller checks this year, we’re still talking a big chunk of cash. Naturally, you don’t want to blow it all on frivolous purchases that you’ll regret later. Rather, it’s better to consider an accretive approach, particularly long-term stocks to buy that can give you back your refund and then some.Finally, if buy something stupid with your refund, the money and any associated benefits evaporate. On the other hand, if certain long-term stocks to buy don’t work out, you may use the losses to your advantage, so as to offset capital gains. With that in mind, below are some enticing market ideas to consider.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsIBMIBM.$135.60XOMExxon Mobil$119.17INTUIntuit$413.52CWCOConsolidated Water$15.12KELYAKelly Services$17.96ROVRRover$3.89CMPSCOMPASS Pathways$9.47IBM (IBM)Photo of IBM (IBM) building as seen through the canopy of a tree. IBM logo is in large letters on side of building.Source: shutterstock.com/LCVFor many years, IBM (NYSE:IBM) struggled as other technology firms stole its thunder. Dragged down by legacy businesses, “Big Blue” just couldn’t keep pace with younger, nimbler competitors. However, management got its act together and now, a “new” Blue is in town.Don’t believe me? While the tech-centric Nasdaq Composite index dropped nearly 17% of market value in the trailing year, IBM managed to poke its head just above parity. It’s not an impressive performance by itself but it’s a lot better than 17% down. Plus, unlike other tech firms that absorbed double-digit percentage losses in 2022, IBM pays a dividend.Indeed, its forward yield stands at 4.93%, which ranks well above the tech sector’s average yield of 1.37%. Additionally, the company’s payout ratio is 65.45%, which while not small still represents a manageable figure. As well, IBM commands 29 years of consecutive dividend increases, making it one of the best long-term stocks to buy. Admittedly, Wall Street’s consensus assessment for IBM is a hold. However, the average price target of $143.56 implies upside potential of over 7%.Story continuesExxon Mobil (XOM)Exxon Retail Gas LocationSource: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.comGiven all the political dynamism associated with clean energy infrastructures, Exxon Mobil (NYSE:XOM) might not seem a bright idea for long-term stocks to buy. However, as President Joe Biden stated, we’re going to need oil for the next 10 years. If the leader of the Democrats believes in big oil, perhaps you should too.Indeed, my first reaction was that we’re going to need hydrocarbons for much longer than 10 years. Sure enough, other much more esteemed individuals stated the same thing. Therefore, as intolerable as XOM might seem to some investors going all-in on green energy, it’s one of the long-term stocks to buy.If it makes anyone feel any better, while XOM wouldn’t be considered cheap, it’s fiscally robust. Right now, both its long-term revenue trend and trailing-year profitability metrics rate above sector median stats. Additionally, Exxon Mobil enjoys a strong balance sheet. Finally, Wall Street analysts peg XOM as a consensus moderate buy. Further, their average price target stands at $125.28, implying upside potential of almost 10%.Intuit (INTU)Stacks of coins hold up wooden blocks that spell out ""TAX."" FairTaxSource: ShutterstockYou just got done doing your taxes and getting your so-called refund. Why then should you invest in Intuit (NASDAQ:INTU), the popular tax and accounting software provider? Mainly, Intuit helps doing taxes a less onerous and painful process. Therefore, you can feel good knowing that your money supports a noble cause. More importantly, though, Intuit enjoys an underappreciated catalyst: the gig economy.Everyone loves talking about the gig economy because of its lucrative potential. One research firm believes it will command a valuation of $873 billion by 2028. It very well might but here’s the thing: what really distinguishes employees from independent contractors (gig workers) is the tax-filing requirements.Long story short, gig workers essentially operate as businesses; that is, people are in business for themselves. Therefore, the taxes are appropriately complex. For first time gig workers, Intuit’s tax programs may be a lifesaver. Currently, Wall Street analysts peg INTU as a consensus strong buy. Also, their average price target stands at $492.33, implying over 17% upside potential. Therefore, it’s a great idea for long-term stocks to buy.Consolidated Water (CWCO)A zoomed in photo of a drop of water hitting a container of water's surface.Source: Sambulov Yevgeniy/ShutterStock.comBy most measures, Consolidated Water (NASDAQ:CWCO) represents a boring example of long-term stocks to buy. Per its website, Consolidated is an international water solutions company, supplying potable water, treating water for reuse, and manufacturing and providing water-related products and services. To be fair, it’s boilerplate stuff.However, where Consolidated gets interesting is in desalination. On one of its webpages, the company “designs, builds, operates, and in some cases finances seawater reverse osmosis (SWRO) desalination plants and water distribution systems in several Caribbean countries, where the supply of drinking water is scarce and the use of SWRO is economically feasible.”Here’s the deal – water scarcity represents a brewing global crisis. Over the long run, desalination stands poised to deliver incredible solutions. Also, advancements in renewable energy infrastructures or even nuclear could make desalination even more feasible. Presently, one analyst covers CWCO with a buy rating and a price target implying upside of 35%. For speculators, it’s well worth consideration for long-term stocks to buy.Kelly Services (KELYA)An image of a businesswoman shaking hands with a female executive at a job interviewSource: ShutterstockOne of the discombobulating circumstances associated with the post-pandemic new normal centers on how quickly circumstances may change. Earlier, it seemed as if employers were begging for job applicants, throwing in concessions wherever possible. These days, however, mass layoffs appear to be a central theme, particularly for the tech industry.Fortunately, that’s where Kelly Services (NASDAQ:KELYA) might bring some hope to the table. As a staffing agency, its phone lines are probably busy at the moment. And they could get busier still. That’s because Kelly doesn’t just specialize in one particular niche, like finance and accounting. Rather, the company features connections with a broad range of industries.What I’m getting at is that beggars can’t be choosers. Once the bills start piling up, people may lose their pride and pick up a warehousing shift. Thus, KELYA makes for an intriguing (albeit cynical) candidate for long-term stocks to buy. Finally, covering analysts peg KELYA as a consensus moderate buy. As well, their average price target stands at $24.50, implying upside potential of over 36%.Rover (ROVR)a puppy and a kitten sniggling together. represents pet stocksSource: ShutterstockAmericans love their pets – perhaps a bit too much. Still, the numbers won’t be denied. In 2021, the American Pet Products Association revealed that total pet industry sales hit $123.6 billion. Personally, I’d bet an even stronger result for 2022. And that bodes well for Rover (NASDAQ:ROVR), a platform that connects dog owners with independent canine service providers.Now, during the worst of the coronavirus pandemic, most white-collar workers operated remotely. However, more than a few high-profile enterprises began recalling their employees. Suddenly, pet owners no longer can care for their furry friends. Therefore, to keep their four-legged family members occupied, a professional dog care specialist may be necessary. In my view, then, ROVR represents an enticing name among long-term stocks to buy.Despite its volatility risks, Wall Street analysts peg ROVR as a consensus moderate buy. Also, their average price target stands at $5.58, implying upside potential of almost 41%.COMPASS Pathways (CMPS)psychedelic stocksSource: luckakcul / Shutterstock.comIf you’re feeling that something isn’t quite right in the U.S., you’re not alone. According to a survey which CNN conducted in partnership with the Kaiser Family Foundation, an overwhelming majority of Americans believe the country is experiencing a mental health crisis. I’m not going to dive too deeply into the topic but many of the individual stories are heart wrenching.However, COMPASS Pathways (NASDAQ:CMPS) offers an innovative solution. Leveraging psilocybin therapy, Compass aims to help patients suffering from treatment-resistant depression. Of course, the company attracts some misunderstandings as psilocybin represents a naturally occurring psychedelic. Still, clinical evidence suggests that the approach carries much potential, though additional research must be undertaken.Inherently, CMPS is a high-risk, high-reward venture among long-term stocks to buy. Still, if you decide to go ahead, you’ll be glad to know that Wall Street stands behind you. Currently, CMPS carries a strong buy consensus view. As well, analysts believe shares will hit $56, implying nearly 500% upside potential.On the date of publication, Josh Enomoto did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.A former senior business analyst for Sony Electronics, Josh Enomoto has helped broker major contracts with Fortune Global 500 companies.

This compares to loss of $0.09 per share a year ago. These figures are adjusted for non-recurring items.This quarterly report represents an earnings surprise of -229.17%. A quarter ago, it was expected that this brewer would post earnings of $3.16 per share when it actually produced earnings of $3.82, delivering a surprise of 20.89%.Over the last four quarters, the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates just once.Boston Beer , which belongs to the Zacks Beverages - Alcohol industry, posted revenues of $447.53 million for the quarter ended December 2022, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 11.96%. This compares to year-ago revenues of $348.09 million.

In Q4 2022, Warren Buffett significantly reduced his investment in Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (NYSE:TSM) only a few months after disclosing a substantial stake. This rapid turnaround by the famous stock picker has spooked investors, and sentiment towards the chip giant has dampened as a result. Berkshire Hathaway reduced its ownership of Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (NYSE:TSM)'s American depositary receipts by 86% in the fourth quarter, according to the latest filings. If Berkshire sold the shares at the average price during that time, the sale of the stake would have raked in $3.7 billion. In the wake of this announcement, the stock prices of the world's largest chip manufacturer declined by up to 4% in Taipei, contributing to widespread losses in the market.Tony Huang, vice president at Taishin Securities Investment Advisory Co, told Bloomberg on February 15: “It’s surprising that Berkshire cut its holding so much in just a quarter, which differs from its past practice of long-term investment and continuing to add shares.”While Berkshire Hathaway opted to sell its holdings in Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (NYSE:TSM), it added 333,856 shares to its position in Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL). For Q4 2022, Apple reported its worst revenue results for a holiday season in seven years.Some of the best long-term stocks to buy according to Warren Buffett include The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO), American Express Company (NYSE:AXP), and Bank of America Corporation (NYSE:BAC). Our MethodologyWe selected the stocks from the Q4 portfolio of Berkshire which have been part of the fund's portfolio for at least 5 years.

The biggest component of this increase was the introduction of a 4% weight in Apple, which is discussed further below. Offsetting this increased tech weight was a 3-percentage point decrease in industrials and a two-percentage point decline in health care. The other two largest purchases include Visa Inc. (NYSE:V) and Abbott Labs which likewise saw their valuations improve as their estimated free cash flows held up or improved while their enterprise values declined.”8. VeriSign, Inc.

DaVita Inc. (NYSE:DVA)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 30Berkshire’s Holding Period: 11 YearsBerkshire’s Stake Value: $2,695,256,212DaVita Inc. (NYSE:DVA) is a Colorado-based company that provides kidney dialysis services for patients suffering from chronic kidney failure. In Q4 2022, Buffett owned 36 million shares of DaVita Inc. (NYSE:DVA) worth $2.7 billion, representing 0.90% of the total 13F securities. It is one of the long-term stock picks of Buffett, featuring on the Berkshire portfolio for 11 years. On November 1, Pito Chickering, an analyst at Deutsche Bank, lowered DaVita Inc. (NYSE:DVA)’s rating from Buy to Hold and set a new price target of $72, down from $97, following the release of its Q3 results. The analyst informed investors that healthcare service providers have been affected by inflationary pressures in 2022, and DaVita has managed these challenges exceptionally well. However, he attributes the downgrade to the issue of patients missing appointments at dialysis clinics in Q3 and the company's guidance on this matter.According to Insider Monkey’s data, 30 hedge funds were bullish on DaVita Inc. (NYSE:DVA) at the end of Q3 2022, compared to 28 funds in the last quarter. Jeffrey Gates’ Gates Capital Management held a prominent stake in the company, consisting of 1.46 million shares worth $121.20 million. Moon Capital made the following comment about DaVita Inc. (NYSE:DVA) in its Q4 2022 investor letter:“During the fourth quarter, we purchased shares in DaVita Inc. (NYSE:DVA), a dialysis center operator. For those unfamiliar, kidney dialysis involves the critical removal of toxins, fluids and salts from the blood by artificial means. Roughly 500,000 patients receive kidney dialysis in the U.S., which requires a 3.5-hour treatment three times a week. The only alternatives to the treatments are a kidney transplant or potential fatality. Given the critical nature of its services, demand has little correlation with the overall economy, resulting in a highly recession resistant business.The U.S. dialysis industry is highly concentrated, with two companies (DaVita and its competitor Fresenius) controlling a combined 80% of the $25 billion market. The dominance of this duopoly provides massive scale advantages, making it incredibly difficult for new entrants to gain profitable market share.In the past, DaVita’s valuation has been penalized (we view unfairly) because the company generates a significant portion of its operating income from a small percentage of its patients. Of DaVita’s 200,000 patients, approximately 90% qualify for Medicare (or Medicaid), with the remaining 10% covered by a commercial insurance provider. While commercial insurers pay an average of $1,000 per treatment, the federal government’s pay rate for Medicare and Medicaid is only $275 – which is actually less than what it costs DVA to provide the treatment…”(Click here to read the full text)6. Moody's Corporation (NYSE:MCO)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 63Berkshire’s Holding Period: 12 YearsBerkshire’s Stake Value: $6,873,493,546Moody's Corporation (NYSE:MCO) is a New York-based integrated risk assessment firm that publishes credit ratings and provides assessment services on various debt obligations, programs and facilities, and entities that issue such obligations. Moody's Corporation (NYSE:MCO) has been in the Berkshire portfolio for 12 years. Buffett owns a $6.8 billion position in the company. On January 31, Moody's Corporation (NYSE:MCO) reported a Q4 non-GAAP EPS of $1.60, beating market estimates by $0.13. The revenue of $1.29 billion outperformed Wall Street consensus by $20 million. For FY2023, the company expects revenue to increase in the mid-to-high single digit percent range and adjusted diluted EPS of $9 to $9.50, versus a consensus of $9.28.Ashish Sabadra, an analyst from RBC Capital, increased the target price for Moody's Corporation (NYSE:MCO) on February 1 from $329 to $350 and maintained an Outperform rating on the company's shares after it exceeded Q4 earnings expectations. In a research note to investors, the analyst said that the company's FY23 guidance may be too cautious because of the anticipated strong recovery in issuance. Additionally, RBC Capital thinks that Moody's projected buyback guidance for 2023 is conservative and will result in only about half of its free cash flows being returned to shareholders.According to Insider Monkey’s third quarter database, 63 hedge funds were long Moody's Corporation (NYSE:MCO), compared to 48 funds in the preceding quarter. Chris Hohn’s TCI Fund Management is a significant position holder in the company, with 8.2 million shares worth $2 billion. In addition to The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO), American Express Company (NYSE:AXP), and Bank of America Corporation (NYSE:BAC), Moody's Corporation (NYSE:MCO) has featured on the Berkshire portfolio for several years.  Here is what Qualivian Investment Partners has to say about Moody’s Corporation (NYSE:MCO) in its Q2 2021 investor letter:“Moody’s: Revenue, operating profit margins, and EPS all exceeded expectations, and annual guidance for these items (and for free cash flow) was raised. In MIS (Moody’s Investors Service) which houses the traditional ratings business, the outlook for debt issuance was raised for the remainder of the year, while MA (Moody’s Analytics) also came in ahead of expectations. The company leveraged strong revenue growth with strong operating profit margin improvement of 200 bps, with EPS coming in $0.22 ahead of consensus estimates. Management alluded to having interesting opportunities in their M&amp;A pipeline, which we will have to assess when the time comes, but Moody’s management team has been very effective at allocating capital in the past toward value-creating bolt-on acquisitions, especially in their Moody’s Analytics business, a key growth driver for the company.” Click to continue reading and see 5 Best Long-Term Stocks To Buy According To Warren Buffett.  Suggested articles:13 Stocks Big Short Michael Burry is Buying and Selling10 Jim Cramer Stocks This Month10 Tech Stocks To Sell Now According to Cathie Wood Disclosure: None. 10 Best Long-Term Stocks To Buy According To Warren Buffett is originally published on Insider Monkey.]"

If you want to explore similar stocks, you can also take a look at 5 Most Promising EV Stocks According to Analysts.The Global EV Industry: An AnalysisThe global electric vehicle (EV) industry is experiencing unprecedented growth, driven by increasing demand for clean and efficient transportation, along with government incentives and supportive policies. According to a report by Precedence Research, the global EV industry was valued at $208.58 billion in 2022 and is expected to reach a value of $1.10 trillion by 2030, growing at a compound annual growth rate of 23.1% over the forecasted period.The rapid growth of the EV industry is attributed to a variety of factors. Firstly, with advancements in battery technology, battery costs are falling and making EVs more affordable and accessible to consumers. As EVs have become more affordable and are now being viewed as a more eco-friendly and viable alternative to their ICE-powered rivals, EV adoption has accelerated across the globe. Moreover, governments around the world are focused on reducing carbon emissions and so have implemented measures to increase the demand for electric vehicles. In recent years, governments have announced numerous incentives and subsidies, to both EV makers and consumers, in order to incentivize the purchase of electric vehicles. According to Precedence Research, the United States, China and Europe have all seen a considerable rise in electric vehicle sales in recent years, and this trajectory is expected to continue over the forecasted period.By propulsion type, battery-electric vehicles (BEVs) held the largest revenue share of the global EV industry, roughly 67%,  in 2022. However, the plug-in hybrid EV (PHEV) segment is expected to grow at a relatively faster compound annual growth rate, an estimated 43.5%, over the forecasted period primarily due to the cost benefits that PHEVs have over BEVs. Moreover, PHEVs also cater to diverse users' needs since they can be refilled at a gas station as well as charged at a charging point. Finally, the fuel cell electric vehicle (FCEV) segment is expected to record the fastest growth rate over the forecasted period due to hefty investments being poured by both governments and organizations to advance the technology.Story continuesOverall, the global EV industry is on track to become a trillion dollar industry by 2030. By investing in EV stocks, investors can capitalize on the secular growth trends of this booming industry. Some of the most prominent players that are leading the global EV industry include Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA), General Motors Company (NYSE:GM), and Ford Motor Company (NYSE:F).

(NASDAQ:RIVN) in its fourth-quarter 2022 investor letter:“Consumer Discretionary investments along with the lack of exposure to the strong performing Energy sector offset a portion of the above-mentioned gains. Within Consumer Discretionary, the underperformance of electric vehicle (EV) manufacturer Rivian Automotive, Inc. (NASDAQ:RIVN) coupled with lower exposure to this better performing sector hampered relative results. Rivian’s shares fell as investors fretted over the company’s unit economics and how macroeconomic uncertainty is impacting the EV industry.Rivian Automotive, Inc. is an EV manufacturer producing vehicles for the consumer and corporate delivery van markets. Its shares were under pressure during the quarter. Investors remained focused on the company’s execution challenges, the implied unit economics for its vehicles, and near-term headwinds for the automotive industry stemming from a weaker global economy. Despite these headwinds, we are comfortable with Rivian’s liquidity position and its competitive position within the EV industry, which we believe will continue to grow at impressive rates. Rivian should also benefit from its positive product reviews, its integrated technology approach, and its industry partnerships.”In addition to Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA), General Motors Company (NYSE:GM), and Ford Motor Company (NYSE:F), Rivian Automotive, Inc. (NASDAQ:RIVN) is also well-positioned to capture further market share of the EV industry due to its innovative and cutting-edge vehicles. Click to continue reading and see 5 Most Promising EV Stocks According to Analysts.  Suggested articles:15 Dividend Growth Stocks with Highest Rates15 Most Sustainable Companies in the World30 Best Stocks for RetirementDisclosure: None. 12 Most Promising EV Stocks According to Analysts is originally published on Insider Monkey.]"

Today's boost coming from a Barclays note. The firm initiating coverage on Tesla with an overweight rating and a $275 price target. Senior autos reporter Pras Subramanian here with us now. Pras, what's the case here from Barclays on Tesla?PRAS SUBRAMANIAN: I mean, they're basically saying, initiating here, Tesla stands out above all the picks in the auto space, which is kind of a big haul, I think, from their point of view, talking about how there's two clocks, a two clock framework. So there's the first clock, which is the near term. That's cyclical, the economy, spending on inventory, and cars, and parts, things like that. And in the far term, which is secular changes, the big transformation in EVs, the huge sort of rollout, how much it's going to cost, how the society changes.So they-- Dan Levy, the analyst there, says that Tesla is well positioned in both worlds. From a cash point of view, they have a huge cash war chest that they built up over the years they're able to spend on their new cars there. And then also from a long term, kind of their EV and software prowess, they have sort of the ability to-- they're the only company that has been mass produced EVs on a huge scale. And they have the sort of, the software kind of backbone, that they've been using-- developing for many years.So those are two kind of bull cases for Tesla right here, right now. Just real quick, Ford and GM, equal weight. He likes them both. He likes GM more, a bit more, than Ford because of their kind of progress on EVs, execution, and the AV cruise technology.DAVE BRIGGS: That really surprised me. Now we saw a bad quarter from Ford. But they really came out of the gate so strong in the EV space, in particular with the Ford F-150. To hear Barclays choose GM over Ford in that space was a big surprise. Was it something beyond the production issues we've heard of?Story continuesPRAS SUBRAMANIAN: I think it's because, and I didn't see this in the note, but I think it's because GM has their sort of rollout with the Ultium platform that you can make multiple cars off of. Whereas the Mustang Mach-E, the Lightning, all use different platforms. It costs more money to develop these things. You have one-off sort of platforms lying around. It's easier to kind of use one and scale it to multiple different cars.DAVE BRIGGS: When is that Silverado out?PRAS SUBRAMANIAN: This year. Mid this year. And the cheaper one will come out later this year too. So mid this year.SEANA SMITH: Excited about that one?DAVE BRIGGS: I really want to see more and learn more about it. You know I love the F-150 Lightning.SEANA SMITH: You do love the F-150. Pras, what also struck me about this note was a call here that we're seeing on Rivian. Lots of questions about what the future of Rivian looks like. They actually said that it might be best positioned here just in terms of following in Tesla's footsteps, which we're seeing that reflected in the stock price today.PRAS SUBRAMANIAN: Yeah, a really nice move for Rivian today, I mean, almost 9% there, talking about how Rivian sort of is-- they don't want to say that they're the next Tesla. But they're sort of the only pure-play EV that could possibly be the next Tesla because of the fact that they have sort of a moat there with their products. No one else is making adventure vehicles. They have their own sort of technology. They're really kind of cornering the market in that space. And they're pure-play EV. So that's sort of what Dan is saying. He's saying that this is sort of the best positioned automaker to be the next Tesla, not that they're saying that they might be the next Tesla.DAVE BRIGGS: I love these cars. I'm seeing more of them than I ever thought I would. But what is that moat? What is that unique technology that Rivian has that others don't have?PRAS SUBRAMANIAN: Well, I think it comes down to the fact that they have-- it's both product and tech, right? So from a product point of view, there's no other EV pickup or SUV with four motors in each corner. They have their own software. Yeah, they use different components, different suppliers to make their batteries and their motors. But they're also kind of bespoke to them. And they're kind of cornering that market. It's not a work truck. It's an adventure truck.And I think also from a technology point of view, they have a lot of cool little features like the gear tunnel in the truck, like I said, the four motors that each wheel kind of give you pure, they call it, torque vectoring on each-- I mean, this is all nerdy stuff. But it's really--DAVE BRIGGS: Did you drive one? Have you driven one?PRAS SUBRAMANIAN: Yes. We reviewed one. I thought it was incredible. It drives like a sports car but it can kind of go over loose gravel, rocks floating over the ground.DAVE BRIGGS: Shares loved it. Investors loved it. Up up 8% today on this news.SEANA SMITH: All right. And Pras, thanks so much.]"

Levy implicitly acknowledges that Tesla is the best positioned in this all-important “far” term outlook.As for other traditional automakers, Levy is initiating both Ford and GM at Equal Weight, with $6 and $46 price targets, respectively, with a preference for GM “given its progress on EV, stronger execution, (and) Cruise upside.” Levy does not mention anything with regards to the big news that Ford recently halted production and deliveries of the F-150 Lightning EV pickup due to a potential battery issue.Story continuesSpeaking of trucks, Levy’s other Overweight rating among automakers was given to Rivian (RIVN), along with a $28 price target.“We are hard pressed to see any company in the auto landscape as the ‘next Tesla,’ as Tesla has been quite unique in its accomplishments,” Levy said. “That said, if we were to identify any of the start-up EV automakers as the closest to Tesla (vis-à-vis defining characteristics), we believe it would be Rivian. Rivian thus far has established key moats in product and technology.”Shares of Rivian are up over 5% in midday trading.—Pras Subramanian is a reporter for Yahoo Finance.

That's why when we briefly looked at Target's (NYSE:TGT) ROCE trend, we were pretty happy with what we saw.What Is Return On Capital Employed (ROCE)?If you haven't worked with ROCE before, it measures the 'return' (pre-tax profit) a company generates from capital employed in its business. The formula for this calculation on Target is:Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)0.15 = US$4.9b ÷ (US$56b - US$24b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to October 2022).Thus, Target has an ROCE of 15%.  In absolute terms, that's a pretty normal return, and it's somewhat close to the Multiline Retail industry average of 13%. See our latest analysis for Target roceIn the above chart we have measured Target's prior ROCE against its prior performance, but the future is arguably more important. If you'd like, you can check out the forecasts from the analysts covering Target here  for free.So How Is Target's ROCE Trending?While the current returns on capital are decent, they haven't changed much. The company has consistently earned 15% for the last five years, and the capital employed within the business has risen 26% in that time. Since 15% is a moderate ROCE though, it's good to see a business can continue to reinvest at these decent rates of return. Stable returns in this ballpark can be unexciting, but if they can be maintained over the long run, they often provide nice rewards to shareholders.Another thing to note, Target has a high ratio of current liabilities to total assets of 43%. This can bring about some risks because the company is basically operating with a rather large reliance on its suppliers or other sorts of short-term creditors. While it's not necessarily a bad thing, it can be beneficial if this ratio is lower.Story continuesWhat We Can Learn From Target's ROCEIn the end, Target has proven its ability to adequately reinvest capital at good rates of return. On top of that, the stock has rewarded shareholders with a remarkable 164% return to those who've held over the last five years. So while the positive underlying trends may be accounted for by investors, we still think this stock is worth looking into further.If you want to know some of the risks facing Target we've found 4 warning signs (1 can't be ignored!) that you should be aware of before investing here.For those who like to invest in solid companies, check out this free list of companies with solid balance sheets and high returns on equity.Have feedback on this article?

In other words, they avoid betting on cheap stocks and waiting long for them to recover. Instead, they believe that ""buying high and selling higher"" is the way to make far more money in lesser time.Everyone likes betting on fast-moving trending stocks, but it isn't easy to determine the right entry point. These stocks often lose momentum when their future growth potential fails to justify their swelled-up valuation. In that phase, investors find themselves invested in shares that have limited to no upside or even a downside. So, betting on a stock just by looking at the traditional momentum parameters could be risky at times.It could be safer to invest in bargain stocks that have been witnessing price momentum recently. While the Zacks Momentum Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to trends in a stock's price or earnings, is pretty useful in identifying great momentum stocks, our 'Fast-Paced Momentum at a Bargain' screen comes handy in spotting fast-moving stocks that are still attractively priced.Navient (NAVI) is one of the several great candidates that made it through the screen. While there are numerous reasons why this stock is a great choice, here are the most vital ones:Investors' growing interest in a stock is reflected in its recent price increase. A price change of 7.2% over the past four weeks positions the stock of this student loan servicing company well in this regard.While any stock can see a spike in price for a short period, it takes a real momentum player to deliver positive returns for a longer time frame. NAVI meets this criterion too, as the stock gained 15.9% over the past 12 weeks.Moreover, the momentum for NAVI is fast paced, as the stock currently has a beta of 1.54. This indicates that the stock moves 54% higher than the market in either direction.Story continuesGiven this price performance, it is no surprise that NAVI has a Momentum Score of B, which indicates that this is the right time to enter the stock to take advantage of the momentum with the highest probability of success.In addition to a favorable Momentum Score, an upward trend in earnings estimate revisions has helped NAVI earn a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). Our research shows that the momentum-effect is quite strong among Zacks Rank #1 and #2 stocks. That's because as covering analysts raise their earnings estimates for a stock, more and more investors take an interest in it, helping its price race to keep up. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stocks here &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Most importantly, despite possessing fast-paced momentum features, NAVI is trading at a reasonable valuation. In terms of Price-to-Sales ratio, which is considered as one of the best valuation metrics, the stock looks quite cheap now. NAVI is currently trading at 0.66 times its sales. In other words, investors need to pay only 66 cents for each dollar of sales.So, NAVI appears to have plenty of room to run, and that too at a fast pace.In addition to NAVI, there are several other stocks that currently pass through our 'Fast-Paced Momentum at a Bargain' screen. You may consider investing in them and start looking for the newest stocks that fit these criteria.This is not the only screen that could help you find your next winning stock pick. Based on your personal investing style, you may choose from over 45 Zacks Premium Screens that are strategically created to beat the market.However, keep in mind that the key to a successful stock-picking strategy is to ensure that it produced profitable results in the past.

We've already hit a lot of tickers today. But guess what? There are more to talk about that are trending on ""Yahoo Finance"" as well. Let's start with Kraft Heinz here. The stock is up only about 3/4 of 1% here. If you look at the year to date chart for KHC, it's down just a little more than 1%.And if you look inside the results, you'll see why kind of investors can't quite make up their mind. The fourth quarter looked relatively strong. Earnings coming in ahead of estimates. Net sales rose by 10%. Volume was down. That's what we've been seeing for a lot of the consumer products companies, that they're making up for lower volume by raising prices. Volume was down, but it wasn't down as much as analysts had predicted.On the flip side, the company's forecast for the full year for earnings per share is a little bit lower than analysts had predicted. Revenues above. So all of this equals not a heck of a lot of change in the shares right now. We're also watching Devon Energy, which is seeing a big slump today.It is down 11% today, down about 8% for the year to date, and it has to do with the company spending this year and what it's going to get for that spending. So capital expenditures this year, $3.7 billion. That is more than analysts expected. On the flip side, that's going to get it about, it says, 653,000 barrels of oil on average a day. That's lower than expected. So spending more to get less than expected, and that's as we're seeing cost to produce oil go higher for some of these companies. So that's why those shares are down.And then finally, a bright spot in the chip space today. That is Analog Devices. Those shares are up about 5% today. That adds to their gains for the year. This company giving a good forecast for the current quarter, and Analog Devices is one of these companies whose chips go into a lot of different stuff. It's analog chips. And so, hence, we are seeing these shares rides today. First quarter revenue is going to be up about $3.2 billion. That's better than the $3.03 billion that analysts had been estimating. So a few more earnings and movers for you here this morning.]"

225,940e50b9-6591-3436-98da-6bb1bce223db,SBAC,2023-02-16,Key Factors to Impact SBA Communications (SBAC) in Q4 Earnings,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/key-factors-impact-sba-communications-131601796.html,1676466961,STORY,['SBAC'],"[SBA Communications Corporation SBAC is scheduled to report fourth-quarter and full-year 2022 results on Feb 21, after market close. The company’s quarterly results are expected to reflect year-over-year growth in revenues and funds from operations (FFO) per share.This Boca Raton, FL-based communications tower REIT delivered a surprise of 1.97% in terms of adjusted FFO (AFFO) per share in the last reported quarter. SBAC witnessed an improvement in site-leasing and site-development businesses, which aided the top line. It continues to benefit from the addition of sites to its portfolio. It also raised its 2022 outlook.Over the preceding four quarters, SBAC’s AFFO per share surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate on each occasion, the average beat being 2.12%. The graph below depicts this surprise history:SBA Communications Corporation Price and EPS SurpriseSBA Communications Corporation Price and EPS SurpriseSBA Communications Corporation price-eps-surprise | SBA Communications Corporation QuoteFactors at PlayThe advancement in mobile technology, such as 4G and 5G networks, and the proliferation of bandwidth-intensive applications have driven the growth in mobile data usage globally. Also, rampant usage of network-intensive applications for video conferencing and cloud services, and remote-working scenarios have fueled the rise.As a result, during the fourth quarter, tower REITs such as SBA Communications are likely to have capitalized on the growing demand for tower leasing as wireless service providers and carriers continue to expand their networks and deploy additional equipment for existing networks to boost their network coverage and capacity.Amid this soaring demand, SBAC long-term (typically 5-10 year) tower leases that have built-in rent escalators are anticipated to have aided its site-leasing revenues in the to-be-reported quarter.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for fourth-quarter site-leasing revenues, which account for the lion’s share of total revenues, is pegged at $605 million, indicating an increase of 12.2% from the year-ago quarter’s $539 million. Our estimate for the same is pegged at $603.3 million.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for fourth-quarter site-development revenues is pegged at $75 million, suggesting growth of 33.9% from $56 million reported in the year-ago period. We estimate the same to be $75.7 million.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for fourth-quarter total revenues is pegged at $681.8 million, implying year-over-year growth of 14.5%. We expect total revenues of $678.9 million for the quarter.  To capitalize on the strong secular growth trends of the wireless industry, SBAC carried out acquisitions and development activities during the fourth quarter. In October 2022, it closed the earlier announced acquisition of 2,632 sites from Grupo TorreSur in Brazil for $725 million in cash. The recent 5G spectrum options in Brazil position SBA Communications well to benefit from the transaction.However, increasing interest expenses amid interest rate hikes might have cast a pall on SBAC’s quarterly performance.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for quarterly FFO per share has been revised marginally downward to $3.13 over the past month. Nonetheless, the figure implies year-over-year growth of 11.4%.For 2022, SBAC projected AFFO per share in the range of $12.12-$12.34. In addition, site-leasing revenues are estimated to be $2,325- $2,335 million while site-development revenues are expected to lie between $291 million and $301 million. The adjusted EBITDA is estimated to be in the band of $1,763-$1,773 million.For the full year, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for FFO per share has remained unrevised at $12.26 over the past month. The figure, however, indicates a 14.2% increase year over year on revenues of $2.63 billion.Story continuesEarning WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively predict a surprise in terms of FFO per share for SBA Communications this season. The combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or higher — increases the odds of a beat. However, that’s not the case here.Earnings ESP: SBAC has an Earnings ESP of -0.03 %.

The subjects of the essays may be known worldwide. Or they may be people who aren't famous - but their character, commitment and impact on others serve as an inspiration to today's students and tomorrow's leaders.The Riding Forward Scholarship Contest enters its 12th year in 2023 and has awarded more than $1.2 million since its inception.""Each year we look forward to receiving these essays from students and learning how Black Americans have shaped their stories,"" said Abbas Merchant, head of Corporate Marketing for Regions Bank. ""These scholarships are an important way we invest in the future while honoring Black History Month.""To celebrate the launch of this year's Riding Forward Scholarship Contest, Regions visited with Black leaders of nonprofit, educational and Diversity, Equity and Inclusion-focused community organizations that have worked with the bank over time. These leaders include Richardson and Julius B. Anthony, founder and executive director of St. Louis Black Authors of Children's Literature, both highlighted on Doing More Today in 2022. Richardson and Anthony are sharing contest information with their constituents and encouraging eligible students to apply. We invite you to do the same.Q: What does Black History Month mean to you?Richardson: It takes strength to rise from slavery to the president of our country. During Black History Month, we stop to celebrate the strength that exists within the community, particularly as a people who continue to overcome systemic economic oppression.Story continuesAnthony: In 2014, I published the poem ""Heritage."" I wrote it for my students at City Academy to inspire and give them context for celebrating Black History Month.Heritage is,Our communal past.Love that last.Legacy.Family.Tradition.Jubilation.Celebration.I have a Heritage.Specifically, Black History Month to me is remembering and celebrating family traditions and culture. My family story begins with the love and courage of a young couple that left the Jim Crow south of Jackson, Alabama, and migrated to St. Louis, hoping and dreaming of a good life. That couple raised eight children in the Jeff-Vander-Lou neighborhood of St. Louis City, of which I was the seventh.Q: What book would you recommend to our readers interested in learning more about Black history and Black leaders?Richardson: My elementary librarian wrote an amazing book, ""Opal Lee and What It Means to Be Free: The True Story of the Grandmother of Juneteenth."" This book highlights the hard-fought end of slavery in our country and Opal Lee's journey in making Juneteenth a federally recognized holiday. This is a children's book with beautiful pictures, but we can all learn from it. Anthony: As an early childhood and elementary school person, the book I recommend is also a picture book! ""Our Children Can Soar"" by Michelle Cook is a beautifully illustrated storybook that takes the reader on a journey through the U.S. Civil Rights movement by highlighting important leaders and culminating with President Barack Obama. As a teacher, it is a great read aloud because it is written in rhyme and supports phonemic awareness skills with good vocabulary words for students in kindergarten through third grade.It reads, in part:""…Rosa sat…So, Martin could march.Martin marched…So, Thurgood could rule.Thurgood ruled…So, Barack could run.Barack ran…So, our children could soar!""Q: What gives you hope about today's civil rights movement?Richardson: Everyday, Peer Power works with a fearless group of young people who are unrelenting in being civil toward others, no matter their differences. These students and their bright future make me hopeful about the civil rights movement today. The movement is in their hands, and that is fine with me!Anthony: I am hopeful about the movement in civil rights today because of what I am witnessing as a social entrepreneur in education. My venture, The Believe Projects®, are literacy labs uniquely tailored to mitigate the dismal learning and emotional development realities of St. Louis' Black children. The labs are strategic, culturally responsive experiences to improve reading proficiency. A Believe lab experience includes 1,000 culturally representative books; visits from bestselling authors; free books for students; literacy-based technology; inspirational murals; aspirational fine art; visits from music artists; and visits to live theater. We are ensuring that all children become confident and competent readers by the end of third grade.Ten years before today, a program like this could not have existed in schools. It would have been considered too out of the box and too radical. Unfortunately, there are still some places where our venture would still be described that way, but I believe hope is alive!Feeling inspired yet?The Regions Riding Forward Scholarship Contest is open to high school seniors and college freshmen, sophomores and juniors who are residents of (or who are currently enrolled in accredited colleges located in) the 15 states that have Regions full service branches. A total of 60 scholarships will be awarded, consisting of 30 high school and 30 college student awards.Discover what receiving the Riding Forward Scholarship meant to additional winners.Here are more details about the 2023 Regions Riding Forward® Scholarship Contest:Each applicant must submit a 500-word (or less) written essay or a 3-minute (or less) video essay that addresses how a Black American individual has inspired change in the applicant's life, and that discusses the contributions of that Black American individual.Applications must be submitted by March 31, 2023.Scholarships will include a total of 30 awards of $2,500 each for high school winners (15 scholarships for written essays and 15 scholarships for video essays) and 30 awards of $1,750 each for winners who are currently enrolled as college students (15 scholarships for written essays and 15 scholarships for video essays).An independent selection committee will judge the written essay and video essay submissions and select the winners.For official rules, complete entry details and eligibility requirements, visit the contest website at www.regions.com/ridingforward.

If Berkshire sold the shares at the average price during that time, the sale of the stake would have raked in $3.7 billion. In the wake of this announcement, the stock prices of the world's largest chip manufacturer declined by up to 4% in Taipei, contributing to widespread losses in the market.Tony Huang, vice president at Taishin Securities Investment Advisory Co, told Bloomberg on February 15: “It’s surprising that Berkshire cut its holding so much in just a quarter, which differs from its past practice of long-term investment and continuing to add shares.”While Berkshire Hathaway opted to sell its holdings in Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (NYSE:TSM), it added 333,856 shares to its position in Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL). For Q4 2022, Apple reported its worst revenue results for a holiday season in seven years.Some of the best long-term stocks to buy according to Warren Buffett include The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO), American Express Company (NYSE:AXP), and Bank of America Corporation (NYSE:BAC). Our MethodologyWe selected the stocks from the Q4 portfolio of Berkshire which have been part of the fund's portfolio for at least 5 years.

The biggest component of this increase was the introduction of a 4% weight in Apple, which is discussed further below. Offsetting this increased tech weight was a 3-percentage point decrease in industrials and a two-percentage point decline in health care. The other two largest purchases include Visa Inc. (NYSE:V) and Abbott Labs which likewise saw their valuations improve as their estimated free cash flows held up or improved while their enterprise values declined.”8. VeriSign, Inc.

DaVita Inc. (NYSE:DVA)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 30Berkshire’s Holding Period: 11 YearsBerkshire’s Stake Value: $2,695,256,212DaVita Inc. (NYSE:DVA) is a Colorado-based company that provides kidney dialysis services for patients suffering from chronic kidney failure. In Q4 2022, Buffett owned 36 million shares of DaVita Inc. (NYSE:DVA) worth $2.7 billion, representing 0.90% of the total 13F securities. It is one of the long-term stock picks of Buffett, featuring on the Berkshire portfolio for 11 years. On November 1, Pito Chickering, an analyst at Deutsche Bank, lowered DaVita Inc. (NYSE:DVA)’s rating from Buy to Hold and set a new price target of $72, down from $97, following the release of its Q3 results. The analyst informed investors that healthcare service providers have been affected by inflationary pressures in 2022, and DaVita has managed these challenges exceptionally well. However, he attributes the downgrade to the issue of patients missing appointments at dialysis clinics in Q3 and the company's guidance on this matter.According to Insider Monkey’s data, 30 hedge funds were bullish on DaVita Inc. (NYSE:DVA) at the end of Q3 2022, compared to 28 funds in the last quarter. Jeffrey Gates’ Gates Capital Management held a prominent stake in the company, consisting of 1.46 million shares worth $121.20 million. Moon Capital made the following comment about DaVita Inc. (NYSE:DVA) in its Q4 2022 investor letter:“During the fourth quarter, we purchased shares in DaVita Inc. (NYSE:DVA), a dialysis center operator. For those unfamiliar, kidney dialysis involves the critical removal of toxins, fluids and salts from the blood by artificial means. Roughly 500,000 patients receive kidney dialysis in the U.S., which requires a 3.5-hour treatment three times a week. The only alternatives to the treatments are a kidney transplant or potential fatality. Given the critical nature of its services, demand has little correlation with the overall economy, resulting in a highly recession resistant business.The U.S. dialysis industry is highly concentrated, with two companies (DaVita and its competitor Fresenius) controlling a combined 80% of the $25 billion market. The dominance of this duopoly provides massive scale advantages, making it incredibly difficult for new entrants to gain profitable market share.In the past, DaVita’s valuation has been penalized (we view unfairly) because the company generates a significant portion of its operating income from a small percentage of its patients. Of DaVita’s 200,000 patients, approximately 90% qualify for Medicare (or Medicaid), with the remaining 10% covered by a commercial insurance provider. While commercial insurers pay an average of $1,000 per treatment, the federal government’s pay rate for Medicare and Medicaid is only $275 – which is actually less than what it costs DVA to provide the treatment…”(Click here to read the full text)6. Moody's Corporation (NYSE:MCO)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 63Berkshire’s Holding Period: 12 YearsBerkshire’s Stake Value: $6,873,493,546Moody's Corporation (NYSE:MCO) is a New York-based integrated risk assessment firm that publishes credit ratings and provides assessment services on various debt obligations, programs and facilities, and entities that issue such obligations. Moody's Corporation (NYSE:MCO) has been in the Berkshire portfolio for 12 years. Buffett owns a $6.8 billion position in the company. On January 31, Moody's Corporation (NYSE:MCO) reported a Q4 non-GAAP EPS of $1.60, beating market estimates by $0.13. The revenue of $1.29 billion outperformed Wall Street consensus by $20 million. For FY2023, the company expects revenue to increase in the mid-to-high single digit percent range and adjusted diluted EPS of $9 to $9.50, versus a consensus of $9.28.Ashish Sabadra, an analyst from RBC Capital, increased the target price for Moody's Corporation (NYSE:MCO) on February 1 from $329 to $350 and maintained an Outperform rating on the company's shares after it exceeded Q4 earnings expectations. In a research note to investors, the analyst said that the company's FY23 guidance may be too cautious because of the anticipated strong recovery in issuance. Additionally, RBC Capital thinks that Moody's projected buyback guidance for 2023 is conservative and will result in only about half of its free cash flows being returned to shareholders.According to Insider Monkey’s third quarter database, 63 hedge funds were long Moody's Corporation (NYSE:MCO), compared to 48 funds in the preceding quarter. Chris Hohn’s TCI Fund Management is a significant position holder in the company, with 8.2 million shares worth $2 billion. In addition to The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO), American Express Company (NYSE:AXP), and Bank of America Corporation (NYSE:BAC), Moody's Corporation (NYSE:MCO) has featured on the Berkshire portfolio for several years.  Here is what Qualivian Investment Partners has to say about Moody’s Corporation (NYSE:MCO) in its Q2 2021 investor letter:“Moody’s: Revenue, operating profit margins, and EPS all exceeded expectations, and annual guidance for these items (and for free cash flow) was raised. In MIS (Moody’s Investors Service) which houses the traditional ratings business, the outlook for debt issuance was raised for the remainder of the year, while MA (Moody’s Analytics) also came in ahead of expectations. The company leveraged strong revenue growth with strong operating profit margin improvement of 200 bps, with EPS coming in $0.22 ahead of consensus estimates. Management alluded to having interesting opportunities in their M&amp;A pipeline, which we will have to assess when the time comes, but Moody’s management team has been very effective at allocating capital in the past toward value-creating bolt-on acquisitions, especially in their Moody’s Analytics business, a key growth driver for the company.” Click to continue reading and see 5 Best Long-Term Stocks To Buy According To Warren Buffett.  Suggested articles:13 Stocks Big Short Michael Burry is Buying and Selling10 Jim Cramer Stocks This Month10 Tech Stocks To Sell Now According to Cathie Wood Disclosure: None. 10 Best Long-Term Stocks To Buy According To Warren Buffett is originally published on Insider Monkey.]"

(V) is Attracting Investor Attention: Here is What You Should Know,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/visa-inc-v-attracting-investor-140002524.html,1676469602,STORY,['V'],"[Visa (V) is one of the stocks most watched by Zacks.com visitors lately. So, it might be a good idea to review some of the factors that might affect the near-term performance of the stock.Over the past month, shares of this global payments processor have returned +2.9%, compared to the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's +3.5% change. During this period, the Zacks Financial Transaction Services industry, which Visa falls in, has gained 2.1%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?Although media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.Revisions to Earnings EstimatesHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.Our analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.For the current quarter, Visa is expected to post earnings of $1.97 per share, indicating a change of +10.1% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed +0.8% over the last 30 days.The consensus earnings estimate of $8.43 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of +12.4%. This estimate has changed +1.7% over the last 30 days.Story continuesFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $9.56 indicates a change of +13.5% from what Visa is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed +0.7%.Having a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, Visa is rated Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPS12-month consensus EPS estimate for V _12MonthEPSChartUrlRevenue Growth ForecastWhile earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.In the case of Visa, the consensus sales estimate of $7.74 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of +7.7%. The $32.24 billion and $35.58 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of +10% and +10.4%, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryVisa reported revenues of $7.94 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +12.4%. EPS of $2.18 for the same period compares with $1.81 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $7.68 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +3.38%. The EPS surprise was +8.46%.The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.ValuationNo investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.While comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.As part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.Visa is graded C on this front, indicating that it is trading at par with its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.ConclusionThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Visa. However, its Zacks Rank #2 does suggest that it may outperform the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: The Coca-Cola Co. KO, Caterpillar Inc.'s CAT, salesforce.com Inc. CRM, The Procter &amp; Gamble Co. PG and Visa Inc.'s V.Here are highlights from Tuesday’s Analyst Blog:5 Blue-Chip Stocks to Buy Despite Sluggish Start to the YearU.S. stock markets have rallied year to date. after  wrapping up 2022 as the worst year since 2008, terminating a three-year winning streak. Major stock indexes suffered a huge blow last year. However, the Dow suffered the least.Dow Changes Course in 2023In 2022, the Dow fell 8.8% year over year, while the S&amp;P 500 and the Nasdaq Composite plummeted 19.4% and 33.1%, respectively. Last year, the Fed raised the benchmark interest rate by 4.25% to combat 40-year high inflation.A higher interest rate is detrimental to growth stocks like consumer discretionary and technology. In contrast to the Nasdaq Composite and the S&amp;P 500 indexes, the 30-stock Dow is more inclined to cyclical stocks than growth stocks. Therefore, the index suffered the least. However, the situation has taken a turn in 2023.Dow Lags Peers Year to DateLess-than-expected inflation rates in October, November and December with respect to several measures have clearly indicated this. On Jan 31, the Department of Labor reported that the employment cost index for fourth-quarter 2022 rose 1%, below the consensus mark of a 1.2% rise. The metric for third-quarter 2022 was also 1.2%. The data clearly indicates that the wage rate, a major source of current inflation, is declining as expected by the Fed.On Feb 1, in its February FOMC meeting, the Fed hiked the benchmark interest rate by 25 basis points to the range of 4.50% to 4.75%, marking its highest rate since late 2007. Market participants are expecting two more rate hikes of 25 basis points each in 2023.Story continuesThe technology sector is no longer overvalued. We are seeing early signs of market participants' confidence returning to this sector. Of the three major stock indexes — year to date — The S&amp;P 500 and the Nasdaq Composite advanced 7.8% and 13.6%, respectively. The Dow gained just 3.3%.U.S. Economy CoolingThe U.S. economy expanded 2.9% in fourth-quarter 2022. Although the metric exceeded the consensus mark of 2.6%, it declined from the third-quarter's growth rate of 3.2%. The latest projection by the Atlanta Fed revealed that the U.S. economy may have expanded by 2.2% in first-quarter 2023.A devastated housing market owing to the high mortgage rate, disappointing retail sales in December, the peak festive season, huge inventory accumulation by several retailers, a sharp fall in U.S. manufacturing activities and a notable decline in factory orders and industrial production indicated that the U.S. economy is cooling in the direction desired by the Fed.Moreover, several U.S. corporate behemoths have already retrenched manpower to a good extent at high levels. Lack of earnings visibility due to some near-term concerns related to business opportunities is the primary reason for recent job cuts.Market participants are expecting more softness in consumer spending and a decline in business spending due to a margin squeeze resulting in moderate GDP growth. Powell also warned of some toughness going forward. As a result, growth and momentum stocks may underperform cyclical value stocks in 2023. Our Top PicksWe have narrowed our search to five blue-chip (components of Dow) stocks with strong potential for 2023. These stocks have seen positive earnings estimate revisions in the last 60 days.

It also wants to have 50GW of renewables projects under some stage of development by then.The expansion in offshore wind is in spite of recent concerns over thinning margins in the sector due to supply chain issues and growing competition, although last week Looney rowed back on plans to cut the company's oil and gas output after BP reported a record profit of $28 billion in 2022.Bausenwein said that some of the inflationary pressure in the offshore wind sector was ""calming down"".

With no Russian gas flowing through either Yamal-Europe or Nord Stream, the only routes for natural gas supplies to Europe are through Ukraine and the Turkstream pipeline across Black Sea. Gazprom's average daily deliveries to Europe for the first 15 days of February increased to 67.8 million cubic meters against 58.1 million cubic meters per day on average in January, according to data from the European Network of Transmission System Operators for Gas (ENTSOG) and from Gazprom data on supplies via Ukraine. Gas pipeline exports to Europe in the first half of February totalled 1 billion cubic metres, according to Reuters calculations. Gazprom, which previously disclosed export data twice a month, has since the beginning of 2023 stopped publishing such data. Gazprom did not respond to a request for comment on the calculations. Gazprom, which holds the world's largest natural gas reserves, was formed out of the Soviet gas industry ministry as the Soviet Union crumbled. It is one of Russia's biggest taxpayers. Russia and Turkey formally launched TurkStream with capacity of 31.5 billion cubic metres per year in January 2020. The pipeline carries Russian natural gas to southern Europe through the Black Sea and Turkey. Gazprom's supplies to the European Union via Turkstream and Ukraine totalled about 1.02 billion cubic meters in the first 15 days of February, of which about 560 million cubic meters, or 37.3 million cubic meters per day, were sent via the Turkish Stream, according to Reuters calculations. Transit through Ukraine amounted to about 458 million cubic meters, or an average of 30.5 million cubic meters per day. In December last year, exports to Europe via these two routes amounted, according to Reuters calculations, to 2.5 billion cubic meters, of which 1.2 billion, or 39.6 million cubic meters per day, went through Turkey. In January, deliveries amounted to about 1.8 billion cubic meters, having decreased by almost 30% by December. For 15 days in January, exports to Europe were at the level of 955 million cubic meters. The throughput capacity of each thread of the Turkish Stream is 15.75 billion cubic meters, or 43.1 million cubic meters per day. One thread is intended for Turkey, the second for European consumers.

The state is facing an election in late March.""We don’t know how the NSW Treasurer can talk about levelling the playing field for coal companies,"" Glencore said in an emailed statement.""Under the updated directions Glencore, which produces about 30% of NSW’s thermal coal, is expected to provide up to 65% of the coal shortfall.""Yancoal Australia and Whitehaven also said they would be impacted.From April 2023 to June 2024, Yancoal will make up to 310,000 tonnes of coal available per quarter for domestic use, while Whitehaven will set aside either 200,000 tonnes or 5% of each of its mine's thermal coal production per quarter, whichever is lower, the companies said on Thursday.Shares in Whitehaven tumbled as much as 12.3% to hit a near six-month low before paring most gains to trade down 2.7%. Yancoal stock dropped 2.3%, while fellow coal miner New Hope Corp slipped 3.8%.The NSW government during its talks with Yancoal on the latest policy told the company it would not be compensated for the difference between market rates and the price it receives selling volumes under the policy, the coal miner said.Story continuesYancoal, however, said it could be eligible for a compensation in certain situations if costs incurred exceed the capped price of coal. Similarly, Whitehaven noted that an application could be made to raise the price cap under certain circumstances.A notice published by the NSW government showed that mines owned by BHP Group and Peabody Energy will also have to comply with the legislation.BHP has said the new policy could affect its plan to keep its Mt Arthur coal mine, the state's largest single coal mine, open until 2030.(Reporting by Melanie Burton in Melbourne Harish Sridharan and Sameer Manekar in Bengaluru; Editing by Subhranshu Sahu, Rashmi Aich and Michael Perry)]"

Is there any common thread between this story and Rupert Murdoch and the succession there and News Corp and the merger, which has now been called off?JAMES STEWART: Well, this book has been compared to the TV series ""Succession."" And having been watching it and I love it, it is clearly an amalgam of material taken from the Murdoch family, some taken from Sumner Redstone. But for some reason, in these big media companies, in particularly, succession is a huge issue. I mean, it's cropped up at Disney just recently. Look, they got rid of the chief executive. They had to bring Iger back.The Murdoch family is struggling to figure out how to do that. The unbelievable battle that went on here at Paramount Global, there does seem to be something about the spotlight that is on these media companies. And maybe it's just the sheer-- the glamor, the power, the fun, whatever people think it is. Nobody wants to give these up once they're in the leadership positions.On the other hand, if you think running one of these companies is going to make you happy or making the billions that Sumner Redstone did, this is a case study in how immense wealth does not bring happiness or peace of mind.DAVE BRIGGS: Yeah, no, thanks.JAMES STEWART: No.ALLIE CANAL: Yeah, and you mentioned Disney and Bob Iger what do you think will be key in that succession plan in order for it to not go horribly wrong like the last time?JAMES STEWART: Well, he said he's leaving in two years.ALLIE CANAL: Allegedly.JAMES STEWART: Allegedly.ALLIE CANAL: We'll see.JAMES STEWART: And I have to say that I don't know that there are many people that take that strictly at face value because it's two years isn't very long. And that's a massive company. If he hadn't groomed a successor before, it may take longer than two years. There are some talented people working there, but no obvious candidate to step in as soon as two years. AndStory continuesI mean, I tip my hat to Iger. He's a master of communication. Wall Street loves him. Already, the stock has gone up quite a bit. He managed to stand down the latest proxy challenge from Nelson Peltz. So it'll be really interesting to see what he can do there. But again, Disney, Paramount Global, even Netflix and Amazon, they're all facing the same fundamental issues, which is streaming so far has not proven to be a profitable business, except for the people making the streaming content.DAVE BRIGGS: Yeah, that's a difficult road. So he says he's going to-- Iger-- stay two years. Elon Musk now says he's going to stay at least through the end of this year at Twitter. He sat with Rupert Murdoch at the Super Bowl, if there's a common thread there. How do you think that story plays itself out at Twitter? Does anyone want to work for Elon?JAMES STEWART: Well, I will say this for Elon at Twitter. At least it has calmed down after the unbelievable chaos that was running rampant there. I just-- look, I'm not going to count the Musk out. The previous formula was not really working there. And although he's taken some really drastic measures, chopping the personnel, he is getting the costs down. The advertisers have fled, but will they come back? I wouldn't want to bet against him.DAVE BRIGGS: And you hear that a lot. He's done pretty well with Tesla and with SpaceX and most other things he's touched. Allie Canal, thank you. James Stewart.

So it might be obvious that you need to consider debt, when you think about how risky any given stock is, because too much debt can sink a company. We can see that Verizon Communications Inc. (NYSE:VZ) does use debt in its business. But is this debt a concern to shareholders?When Is Debt A Problem?Debt and other liabilities become risky for a business when it cannot easily fulfill those obligations, either with free cash flow or by raising capital at an attractive price. If things get really bad, the lenders can take control of the business. However, a more common (but still painful) scenario is that it has to raise new equity capital at a low price, thus permanently diluting shareholders. Of course, the upside of debt is that it often represents cheap capital, especially when it replaces dilution in a company with the ability to reinvest at high rates of return. When we think about a company's use of debt, we first look at cash and debt together. Check out our latest analysis for Verizon Communications How Much Debt Does Verizon Communications Carry?As you can see below, Verizon Communications had US$153.6b of debt, at December 2022, which is about the same as the year before. You can click the chart for greater detail. And it doesn't have much cash, so its net debt is about the same.debt-equity-history-analysisHow Strong Is Verizon Communications' Balance Sheet?We can see from the most recent balance sheet that Verizon Communications had liabilities of US$50.2b falling due within a year, and liabilities of US$237.0b due beyond that. On the other hand, it had cash of US$2.71b and US$25.2b worth of receivables due within a year. So its liabilities outweigh the sum of its cash and (near-term) receivables by US$259.4b.Story continuesThis deficit casts a shadow over the US$169.6b company, like a colossus towering over mere mortals. So we'd watch its balance sheet closely, without a doubt. At the end of the day, Verizon Communications would probably need a major re-capitalization if its creditors were to demand repayment.We measure a company's debt load relative to its earnings power by looking at its net debt divided by its earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) and by calculating how easily its earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) cover its interest expense (interest cover). This way, we consider both the absolute quantum of the debt, as well as the interest rates paid on it.Verizon Communications has net debt to EBITDA of 3.3 suggesting it uses a fair bit of leverage to boost returns. On the plus side, its EBIT was 8.2 times its interest expense, and its net debt to EBITDA, was quite high, at 3.3. Unfortunately, Verizon Communications saw its EBIT slide 2.6% in the last twelve months. If earnings continue on that decline then managing that debt will be difficult like delivering hot soup on a unicycle. There's no doubt that we learn most about debt from the balance sheet. But ultimately the future profitability of the business will decide if Verizon Communications can strengthen its balance sheet over time. So if you want to see what the professionals think, you might find this free report on analyst profit forecasts to be interesting.Finally, while the tax-man may adore accounting profits, lenders only accept cold hard cash. So we always check how much of that EBIT is translated into free cash flow. Over the last three years, Verizon Communications barely recorded positive free cash flow, in total. While many companies do operate at break-even, we prefer see substantial free cash flow, especially if a it already has dead.Our ViewWe'd go so far as to say Verizon Communications's level of total liabilities was disappointing. But on the bright side, its interest cover is a good sign, and makes us more optimistic. We're quite clear that we consider Verizon Communications to be really rather risky, as a result of its balance sheet health. For this reason we're pretty cautious about the stock, and we think shareholders should keep a close eye on its liquidity. When analysing debt levels, the balance sheet is the obvious place to start. But ultimately, every company can contain risks that exist outside of the balance sheet. Be aware that  Verizon Communications is showing  2 warning signs in our investment analysis , you should know about...At the end of the day, it's often better to focus on companies that are free from net debt.

If you want to see more most profitable dividend stocks, go directly to 5 Most Profitable Dividend Stocks.Dividend stocks are stocks of companies that pay dividends.Many dividend stocks pay a dividend quarterly as a way to return excess capital back to shareholders. Companies can also use stock repurchases as another way to return excess capital back to shareholders. For those you interested check out 15 Companies That Are Buying Back Their Stock.When company profits rise, many companies tend to pay slightly higher dividends. When company profits decrease, many companies also decrease or even suspend their dividends.Considering the change in tax laws for stock repurchases beginning in 2023 given the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022, dividends could be slightly more attractive. As a result, some companies might be more inclined to return slightly more capital back to shareholders through dividends than stock repurchases.Jones Day describes the effect of the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022, ""U.S. (and in certain instances, non-U.S.) corporations, whose stock is traded on an established securities market, that undertake share repurchases of more than $1 million in the aggregate per tax year, will be subject to a 1% share excise tax on the value of any share repurchase unless such share repurchase is taxed as a dividend (other exceptions and exclusions may apply).""While the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 could affect dividend payments slightly, the largest determination of how much capital companies return through dividends will still likely be how much the companies make in profits in the near term and how much excess capital management of companies think they have.If there is a possibility of an economic slowdown or even a recession in the future, many companies may not raise their dividends even if their profits increase. If the economic slowdown or recession occurs, many companies will likely cut or even suspend their dividends.Story continuesIn terms of the possibility of an economic slowdown or a recession, the probability will depend on economic developments and how much further the Federal Reserve raises interest rates.Although inflation has cooled from their 2022 highs late last year, the Federal Reserve has indicated that it will raise rates further. If the U.S. central bank raises interest rates too much, there is potential for an economic slowdown or even a recession. If that happens, demand will soften for a lot of companies and company profits could decline.Given the uncertainty, it could be a good idea for long term investors to own a well diversified portfolio of leading stocks across many different sectors.Building, Real estate, HoldingMethodologyFor our list of 15 Most Profitable Dividend Stocks, we used the Fortune 500 list to find the most profitable American companies and we then filtered the list to find the stocks that paid dividends and that were profitable according to YCharts in terms of net income for the trailing twelve months.Because we used YCharts data, the net income may not be the same as adjusted profit.For some stocks, the trailing twelve months isn't the same time period as it for others given some stocks have not reported their fourth quarter earnings results yet.15 Most Profitable Dividend Stocks15.

Within the segment, the Power Tools division is experiencing weakness (revenues down 5% organically in 2022) due to reduced consumer spending as a result of an increase in interest rates. For 2023, SWK expects segmental organic revenues to decline in the low single digits with an approximately 5% decrease in volumes.Supply-chain restrictions, primarily semiconductor constraints, and logistics and input cost increases weighed on Stanley Black’s operations in 2022. Despite improvement in supply-chain constraints and an anticipated reduction in raw material costs in 2023 (due to deceleration in inflation), the persistence of these headwinds poses a threat to the bottom-line performance.Given Stanley Black’s substantial international presence, foreign currency headwinds have been a major challenge. In fourth-quarter 2022, foreign currency translation had a negative impact of 3% on sales.For 2023, Stanley Black expects a soft demand environment compared to that experienced last year. The company anticipates a decline in volumes compared to last year, with an expected decrease in new housing starts and remodel activity. SWK expects organic growth to decline in the low single digits in the year. For 2023, the company expects adjusted earnings per share in the range of 0-$2. In 2022, it reported adjusted earnings (from continuing operations) of $4.62 per share.Zacks Rank &amp; Key PicksStanley Black &amp; Decker currently carries a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell).Some better-ranked stocks within the broader Industrial Products sector are as follows:Allegion plc ALLE presently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

SubscribeThursday, February 16, 2023Today's newsletter is by Jared Blikre, a reporter focused on the markets on Yahoo Finance. Follow him on Twitter @SPYJared. Read this and more market news on the go with the Yahoo Finance App.The AI genie has escaped the bottle with a velocity not matched in modern human history, and investors are starting to take notice. Wednesday, C3.ai (AI) and SoundHound AI (SOUN) added to their 2023 gains — each up about 120% this year.Despite the outperformance of these thematic AI names, the industry is still relatively small, leaving many investors wondering how to invest. Already, one veteran macro trader is peering far beyond the hype, warning that investment in AI could be the ""biggest bubble of all time.""Raoul Pal, the CEO and founder of Real Vision Group, recently spoke to Yahoo Finance Uncut about the tremendous growth in artificial intelligence as well as the knock-on effects of mass adoption. He believes that the number of applications for AI is set to explode, and we are not yet ready to deal with the implications of this exponential growth.Pal argues that hand-in-hand with the growth story, AI will usher in a global deflationary shock — one of the largest the world has ever seen.""I think it might be bigger [by] orders of magnitude than China joining the [World Trade Organization]. I can't express how powerful what is happening is,"" he said, referring to the 2001 WTO decision that paved the way for China to become a manufacturing and trade juggernaut — ushering in an era of cheap imported goods for Americans.Similarly, experts forecast that AI will replace many workers while lowering the cost of goods and services for consumers.But despite the lofty visions of industry insiders and investors looking for the next big thing, the technology is still relatively young, with few investing opportunities at scale. Guardforce AI (GFAI), and BigBear.ai Holdings (BBAI) are pure-play names attracting attention. But even the largest among them — the aforementioned enterprise-software leader, C3.ai — only has a market cap of $2.5 billion.Story continuesArtificial Intelligence-themed stocks and funds attracting attention (not comprehensive)In the universe of funds, several thematic ETFs include AI — but mostly in addition to the larger robotics theme. The lone exception appears to be the WisdomTree AI and Innovation Fund (WTAI). (Though, a smartly-named ETF with the ticker CHAT recently filed for registration in the U.S.)But investors needn't chase illiquid small-cap stocks to invest in AI.""[F]or the average person, right now, the easiest two ways [to invest in AI] are Microsoft and Google,"" says Pal, adding that both companies are pivoting their entire business models to embrace AI.Microsoft (MSFT) may have an early-mover advantage with ChatGPT. But behind the scenes, Alphabet's Google (GOOGL, GOOG) has been investing in other complementary technologies, which should become major investment opportunities down the road, says Pal.""[D]on't forget — Google's got robotics. Google's got EV. Google's got self driving ... [T]hey've got quantum computing — all in their Google X Labs, which we don't even know about. It's all behind the curtain.""As users adopt these new technologies, the companies that offer them at scale should benefit from network effects — a self-reinforcing phenomenon that exponentially increases their network activity. Semiconductors also fall into this category, says Pal. Companies like Nvidia (NVDA) are key to processing AI data, and they are likely to benefit as the technology becomes more widespread.There will be more high-profile AI failures — some funny, and some scary, as the technology worms its way into our everyday lives and mission-critical systems. But the deck is stacked in favor of exponential growth.While it may seem premature to worry about a bubble in any asset when investors are still reeling front last year's drubbing, Pal focuses on some of the near-term effects. ""If there's ever a reason for the major technology stocks to really have another leg higher, it's on [AI],"" he says.

252,69cc7c00-c81d-3cc9-8846-d8d364d4a5b2,NVDA,2023-02-16,Warren Buffett’s Taiwan Semiconductor sale shakes semiconductor stocks,Yahoo Finance Video,https://finance.yahoo.com/video/warren-buffett-taiwan-semiconductor-sale-161616849.html,1676477776,VIDEO,"['INTC', 'AMD', 'NVDA', 'BRK-A', 'BRK-B', 'TSM']","[Yahoo Finance’s Daniel Howley joins the Live show to discuss the decline in stock for Taiwan Semiconductor following Warren Buffett’s surprise sale.Video TranscriptRACHELLE AKUFFO: But first, a look at our top story-- cutting back on the chips. Warren Buffett suddenly selling off his holdings in Taiwan Semiconductor, causing shares of the chipmaker to fall, as investors wonder if he knows something that others don't. The reversal all the more notable because of how closely the sale follows Buffett's earlier disclosure of his holdings. Buffett, of course, is legendary for his long-term bets on names like Coca-Cola and Apple. So let's get a deeper dive with Yahoo Finance's Dan Howley. I mean, when the oracle makes a move, people pay attention here, Dan.DAN HOWLEY: That's right, Rachelle. We looked at kind of the numbers as far as how much he's dropped in terms of TSMC. He had shed about 86% of his holdings, Berkshire Hathaway, rather, of TSMC. That goes from essentially what was 51 million shares all the way down to around-- I actually have the number right here-- $4.1 billion worth of shares to $617,000 in shares of TSMC. The company's stock price down 5.5% the last I took a look. But increased the value of how much he has in Apple-- that's now at $116.3 billion.And so there's a few things that are worth looking at here when it comes to TSMC. And you can obviously recognize that if TSMC's going down, the rest of the industry, the semiconductor industry, would be going down as well. But there's a few things going on here with TSMC and the broader chip market. That is what's happening in terms of demand.Obviously, during the pandemic, we saw people go out, purchase everything that needed a semiconductor, whether that's cars, phones, laptops, monitors. And now people are pulling back on the buying of at least those tech goods, those phones, monitors, laptops, desktops, things along those lines. So that could be part of the reason that we're seeing.Story continuesBut as you pointed out, and as obviously is well known for Buffett and Berkshire, they hold on to things. So this seems to be a blip as far as the long tail story of semiconductors would be. There is, however, also the story of China and its desire to unify Taiwan and China as one country. You know, obviously, the US's stance is they oppose any kind of unilateral change on the status of Taiwan. But this has raised a lot of concerns as to what this means for companies like TSMC.And, oh, by the way, they also have manufacturing capabilities in China. What does that mean when you look at how the US is trying to cut off some of China's ability to get access to Western technology? So there's this larger issue going on as far as the politics, the geopolitics, of what impacts TSMC. But then we look at something like Apple, and then, obviously, we saw him digging deeper in there, buying up more shares of that company, his largest holding as far as value.And that has to do a little bit more potentially with what he sees going forward for Apple. Yes, they did have a decline in revenue, but prior to Q1's decline from 2019 onward, they had record revenue each quarter. We also have that headset coming, so that means they could be getting into a new hardware space. Not too sure if that means we're actually going to see that take off, though.RACHELLE AKUFFO: Certainly a lot at play here with Apple, obviously, turning towards its own chips, geopolitical issues, and then on top of that, going from a chip shortage to a chip glut. So interesting to see how this plays out. But an interesting move there from the oracle of Omaha. Thanks so much to our very own Dan Howley.]"

The orally administered drug is for the treatment of adult patients with relapsed or refractory mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) after at least two lines of systemic therapy, including a Bruton's tyrosine kinase (BTK) inhibitor.JAYPIRCA was approved by the FDA in January this year for relapsed or refractory MCL, an aggressive and rare form of non-Hodgkin lymphoma. The drug is a highly selective, non-covalent (reversible) BTK inhibitor.The availability of the FDA-approved drug is expected to significantly solidify McKesson’s foothold in the global cancer treatment space and boost its U.S. Pharmaceutical business.Significance of the AvailabilityMcKesson’s management believes that the latest availability has the potential to purposefully improve the treatment outlook for patients suffering from MCL.Industry ProspectsPer a report by Straits Research, the global oncology cancer drugs market was valued at $148,050.6 million in 2021 and is anticipated to reach $288,636.6 million by 2030 at a CAGR of 7.7%. Factors like the rise in the incidence of various cancer conditions and the growing popularity of advanced therapies (such as biological and targeted drug therapies) are expected to drive the market.Given the market potential, the recent drug availability is expected to strengthen McKesson’s position in the global oncology care space.Recent DevelopmentsThis month, McKesson announced that Biologics by McKesson has been selected by Stemline Therapeutics Inc. as a limited distribution network specialty pharmacy provider for ORSERDU (elacestrant). ORSERDU is an estrogen receptor antagonist indicated for the treatment of post-menopausal women or adult men with estrogen receptor-positive, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-negative, ESR1-mutated advanced or metastatic breast cancer with disease progression following at least one line of endocrine therapy.Story continuesAlso, this month, McKesson announced its third-quarter fiscal 2023 results, wherein it registered a robust uptick in its overall top line and bottom line. Per management, the uptick in the fiscal third-quarter revenues was primarily driven by growth in the U.S. Pharmaceutical segment. The segmental growth resulted from increased specialty product volumes, including retail national account customers, market growth and strength across the oncology platform, including increased patient visits.In December 2022, McKesson announced that Biologics by McKesson was selected by Aadi Bioscience as a specialty pharmacy provider for FYARRO (sirolimus protein-bound particles for injectable suspension) (albumin-bound).

But the reality is that when a company loses money each year, for long enough, its investors will usually take their share of those losses. Loss-making companies are always racing against time to reach financial sustainability, so investors in these companies may be taking on more risk than they should.If this kind of company isn't your style, you like companies that generate revenue, and even earn profits, then you may well be interested in Air Products and Chemicals (NYSE:APD). While profit isn't the sole metric that should be considered when investing, it's worth recognising businesses that can consistently produce it. See our latest analysis for Air Products and Chemicals How Fast Is Air Products and Chemicals Growing?Generally, companies experiencing growth in earnings per share (EPS) should see similar trends in share price. That means EPS growth is considered a real positive by most successful long-term investors. Air Products and Chemicals managed to grow EPS by 5.9% per year, over three years. That might not be particularly high growth, but it does show that per-share earnings are moving steadily in the right direction.It's often helpful to take a look at earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) margins, as well as revenue growth, to get another take on the quality of the company's growth. Air Products and Chemicals maintained stable EBIT margins over the last year, all while growing revenue 18% to US$13b.

But we are reassured by the fact they have invested in the company. We note that their impressive stake in the company is worth US$208m. We note that this amounts to 0.3% of the company, which may be small owing to the sheer size of Air Products and Chemicals but it's still worth mentioning.

For more stocks, head on over to Mario Gabelli Stock Picks for 2023: Top 5.GAMCO Investors, Inc. is an American hedge fund that is headquartered in Rye, New York. It is one of the largest investment institutions in the world, with a total of $9.2 billion of stock market investments as of the fourth quarter of last year (for the biggest hedge funds in the world, head on over to 15 Biggest Hedge Funds in the World by AUM). The fund is managed by Mr. Mario J. Gabelli, who is its chief executive officer. Mr. Gabelli set up GAMCO, previously known as Gabelli Asset Management Company, in 1976, and has been running it since then, giving him decades of experience in the finance industry.2022 has been a year of significant economic turmoil, and as we enter 2023, institutions and investors all over are sharing their thoughts on what to expect. For instance, investment bank The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. (NYSE:GS) is one of the more optimistic analysts right now, as it believes that the ever dreaded recession that is being speculated since the mid of last year might be avoided. Mr. Gabelli also has a take on the current situation, and in an interview with CNBC he mirrored sentiments that while the first half of this year will be turbulent, investors can expect the market to take off in 2024. His research comes from the proverbial horse's mouth, as the investor outlined:""A year from now, Joe [laughs], it's gonna be 2024 and the opportunities a year later are gonna be terrific. But short term, what I'm learning from visiting companies, listening to meetings, reading the dynamics, one, goods are becoming more available, but more importantly, the managements have learned how to deal with pass throughs, how to deal with inflation, how to deal with currency, how to deal with the balance sheet and interest rates. And they're learning the inelastic questions about the demand for their products. Now from my point of view revenue's gonna be quite okay this year in nominal terms. Gross margins are going to be challenged short term for the manufacturing sector. SG&amp;A, kind of held in check, and then the question is taxes, we talked about, there's a 15% tax on booked profits, that's kinda gotta be worked out. Bottom line, I think that things are okay, but there's going to be a lot of tension in the first half of the year in the markets.""Story continuesNaturally, his insight merits a deeper look at GAMCO Investors' latest investments, out of which the top three are Herc Holdings Inc.

Is there any common thread between this story and Rupert Murdoch and the succession there and News Corp and the merger, which has now been called off?JAMES STEWART: Well, this book has been compared to the TV series ""Succession."" And having been watching it and I love it, it is clearly an amalgam of material taken from the Murdoch family, some taken from Sumner Redstone. But for some reason, in these big media companies, in particularly, succession is a huge issue. I mean, it's cropped up at Disney just recently. Look, they got rid of the chief executive. They had to bring Iger back.The Murdoch family is struggling to figure out how to do that. The unbelievable battle that went on here at Paramount Global, there does seem to be something about the spotlight that is on these media companies. And maybe it's just the sheer-- the glamor, the power, the fun, whatever people think it is. Nobody wants to give these up once they're in the leadership positions.On the other hand, if you think running one of these companies is going to make you happy or making the billions that Sumner Redstone did, this is a case study in how immense wealth does not bring happiness or peace of mind.DAVE BRIGGS: Yeah, no, thanks.JAMES STEWART: No.ALLIE CANAL: Yeah, and you mentioned Disney and Bob Iger what do you think will be key in that succession plan in order for it to not go horribly wrong like the last time?JAMES STEWART: Well, he said he's leaving in two years.ALLIE CANAL: Allegedly.JAMES STEWART: Allegedly.ALLIE CANAL: We'll see.JAMES STEWART: And I have to say that I don't know that there are many people that take that strictly at face value because it's two years isn't very long. And that's a massive company. If he hadn't groomed a successor before, it may take longer than two years. There are some talented people working there, but no obvious candidate to step in as soon as two years. AndStory continuesI mean, I tip my hat to Iger. He's a master of communication. Wall Street loves him. Already, the stock has gone up quite a bit. He managed to stand down the latest proxy challenge from Nelson Peltz. So it'll be really interesting to see what he can do there. But again, Disney, Paramount Global, even Netflix and Amazon, they're all facing the same fundamental issues, which is streaming so far has not proven to be a profitable business, except for the people making the streaming content.DAVE BRIGGS: Yeah, that's a difficult road. So he says he's going to-- Iger-- stay two years. Elon Musk now says he's going to stay at least through the end of this year at Twitter. He sat with Rupert Murdoch at the Super Bowl, if there's a common thread there. How do you think that story plays itself out at Twitter? Does anyone want to work for Elon?JAMES STEWART: Well, I will say this for Elon at Twitter. At least it has calmed down after the unbelievable chaos that was running rampant there. I just-- look, I'm not going to count the Musk out. The previous formula was not really working there. And although he's taken some really drastic measures, chopping the personnel, he is getting the costs down. The advertisers have fled, but will they come back? I wouldn't want to bet against him.DAVE BRIGGS: And you hear that a lot. He's done pretty well with Tesla and with SpaceX and most other things he's touched. Allie Canal, thank you. James Stewart. The book is ""Unscripted."" Check it out, some incredible storytelling. Great to see you, sir. Thank you.JAMES STEWART: Thank you.]"

Is there any common thread between this story and Rupert Murdoch and the succession there and News Corp and the merger, which has now been called off?JAMES STEWART: Well, this book has been compared to the TV series ""Succession."" And having been watching it and I love it, it is clearly an amalgam of material taken from the Murdoch family, some taken from Sumner Redstone. But for some reason, in these big media companies, in particularly, succession is a huge issue. I mean, it's cropped up at Disney just recently. Look, they got rid of the chief executive. They had to bring Iger back.The Murdoch family is struggling to figure out how to do that. The unbelievable battle that went on here at Paramount Global, there does seem to be something about the spotlight that is on these media companies. And maybe it's just the sheer-- the glamor, the power, the fun, whatever people think it is. Nobody wants to give these up once they're in the leadership positions.On the other hand, if you think running one of these companies is going to make you happy or making the billions that Sumner Redstone did, this is a case study in how immense wealth does not bring happiness or peace of mind.DAVE BRIGGS: Yeah, no, thanks.JAMES STEWART: No.ALLIE CANAL: Yeah, and you mentioned Disney and Bob Iger what do you think will be key in that succession plan in order for it to not go horribly wrong like the last time?JAMES STEWART: Well, he said he's leaving in two years.ALLIE CANAL: Allegedly.JAMES STEWART: Allegedly.ALLIE CANAL: We'll see.JAMES STEWART: And I have to say that I don't know that there are many people that take that strictly at face value because it's two years isn't very long. And that's a massive company. If he hadn't groomed a successor before, it may take longer than two years. There are some talented people working there, but no obvious candidate to step in as soon as two years. AndStory continuesI mean, I tip my hat to Iger. He's a master of communication. Wall Street loves him. Already, the stock has gone up quite a bit. He managed to stand down the latest proxy challenge from Nelson Peltz. So it'll be really interesting to see what he can do there. But again, Disney, Paramount Global, even Netflix and Amazon, they're all facing the same fundamental issues, which is streaming so far has not proven to be a profitable business, except for the people making the streaming content.DAVE BRIGGS: Yeah, that's a difficult road. So he says he's going to-- Iger-- stay two years. Elon Musk now says he's going to stay at least through the end of this year at Twitter. He sat with Rupert Murdoch at the Super Bowl, if there's a common thread there. How do you think that story plays itself out at Twitter? Does anyone want to work for Elon?JAMES STEWART: Well, I will say this for Elon at Twitter. At least it has calmed down after the unbelievable chaos that was running rampant there. I just-- look, I'm not going to count the Musk out. The previous formula was not really working there. And although he's taken some really drastic measures, chopping the personnel, he is getting the costs down. The advertisers have fled, but will they come back? I wouldn't want to bet against him.DAVE BRIGGS: And you hear that a lot. He's done pretty well with Tesla and with SpaceX and most other things he's touched. Allie Canal, thank you. James Stewart. The book is ""Unscripted."" Check it out, some incredible storytelling. Great to see you, sir. Thank you.JAMES STEWART: Thank you.]"

For the best part of the last century, Disney has been an exciting company as an investment and entertainment vehicle. The company had its ups and downs, but those who have remained bullish on the future of entertainment have reaped handsome rewards. From a small studio producing animated short films to a global entertainment conglomerate, Disney has had quite an impact on the world, which is one of the reasons why it continues to dominate entertainment media despite the rise of new technologies and innovative forms of entertainment.Warning! GuruFocus has detected 6 Warning Signs with DIS. Click here to check it out. DIS 15-Year Financial DataThe intrinsic value of DISPeter Lynch Chart of DISThis year is an important year for Disney because it may be the last year in which the company retains exclusive rights to its iconic character Mickey Mouse, which is expected to become public property in 2024.Although Disney has managed to maintain its leadership position in the entertainment industry, the last few years were challenging. One obvious reason is the pandemic that impacted Disneys theme parks business in 2020. Disney+, the company's streaming media platform that partially offset the impact of other business shutdowns, was the company's only hope that lived up to investor expectations. In some regions, such as China, the pandemic lockdowns lasted through 2022, but most of such restrictions have become a thing of the past in Disneys key markets today.With the disruptions from the pandemic coming to a close, what's ahead for Disney? Is the stock a good investment these days?Leadership disruptionsAlthough the company has a history of nearly going bankrupt and then rebounding with greater success, this is highly dependent on the quality of the management team. For example, in 1984, when the animation studio was reporting significant losses, Michael Eisner was elected to lead the company, and Disney became overwhelmingly successful under his leadership. This was known as the Disney Renaissance.Story continuesAfter Bob Iger's retirement in 2020, Bob Chapek took over as CEO of Disney. Chapek aimed to implement changes and strategic initiatives to steer the company in the right direction amid the chaos created by the pandemic. However, many executives expressed to directors their lack of trust in him and complained to Iger about the company's direction under Chapek for months (for some reason, Iger himself reportedly encouraged this distrust of Chapek, despite having selected him as his successor). Chapek was eventually dismissed as CEO in November 2022, and the fiscal year's ""Direct-to-Consumer"" loss was cited as the reason for the CEO change. Iger has been reinstated as CEO and the market reacted positively to this development by sending Disney shares higher after the reappointment of Iger.The encouraging signsThe pandemic closures in 2020 and 2021 impacted revenue from theatres and theme parks while increasing revenue from the streaming business. Disney has made significant investments in recent years to restructure its business to maximize long-term profits, including the launch of Disney+ and the acquisition of a majority stake in Hulu. In addition, the company made significant investments in the streaming industry, including a $30 billion investment in content in 2022 to expand Disney+ and its theatrical releases. However, with theatre releases and ticket sales remaining below pre-pandemic levels, Disney's media and entertainment segment revenue increased just 1% year-over-year in the first quarter of fiscal 2023 while operating income fell 7%, driven by a loss in this segment.Although the restructuring was costly, this has allowed the company to compete with the industry leader Netflix Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) in terms of subscriber growth. Disney+ reached 100 million worldwide subscribers in record time, aided by pandemic tailwinds and its brand recognition globally. The company assured investors that it expects operating losses to ""narrow going forward"" as it works to achieve Disney+ profitability by 2024. Furthermore, Disney has increased its average revenue per user by significantly raising prices across all of its services even while launching an ad-supported tier to lure more subscribers.In terms of box office revenue, the reopening last year saw audiences and revenue gradually return, and this trend is expected to gather pace this year. On the plus side, with the release of Avatar: The Way of Water, Disney has already made huge progress toward recouping its losses in the media and entertainment segment. After only six weeks in theatres, the sequel to 2009's Avatar became a box office hit, grossing more than $2 billion and becoming the sixth highest-earning film in history. According to Variety, the film cost $350 million to produce, implying that the profits from the new film will boost Disney's media business. Furthermore, the studio has several releases for the rest of the year, which is likely to result in lower content costs and higher box office revenue.The outlook for theme parks is improving too. In the most recent quarter, the Parks, Experiences and Products segment revenue increased by 21% year-over-year, and operating income from this segment rose 25%. This is a promising development as the theme parks business has always been a leading contributor to Disneys profits compared to the losses of its DTC business. The company increased ticket prices and monetized once-complimentary services like its Fast Pass program to maximize revenue per consumer in the last quarter. Even as rising inflation reduced demand in other industries, Disney's park attendance remained high and spending per person increased nearly 40% compared to 2019. In response to consumer outrage, Disney reversed some of its price increases in January, including increasing the number of park days available at the lowest price point, but the company has not reduced ticket prices across the board. The company's focus on increasing revenue per person will allow it to maintain revenue if park attendance falls further during an economic downturn.TakeawayDespite recent headwinds, Disney will likely dominate the entertainment space in the foreseeable future. The company has come out of the Covid crisis as a stronger business with a meaningful share of the global streaming industry, and its legacy businesses are operating efficiently compared to pre-pandemic days as well. Short-term headwinds resulting from macroeconomic challenges might lead to some volatility in Disney shares, but the company seems like it could be a good bet for long-term-oriented investors looking for opportunities in the entertainment space.This article first appeared on GuruFocus.]"

MLB hopes any upheaval leads to an end of local blackouts.“The company intends to use the 30-day grace period to continue progressing its ongoing discussions with creditors and other key stakeholders regarding potential strategic alternatives and deleveraging transactions to best position Diamond Sports Group for the future,” Diamond said in a statement.Diamond is a subsidiary of Sinclair Broadcast Group Inc., and its regional networks broadcasts games of 14 MLB, 16 NBA and 12 NHL teams.Manfred said Diamond has told MLB it intends to pay its baseball teams, but he called it an “unfolding story” that could change.“We are prepared no matter what happens with respect to Diamond to make sure the games are available to fans in their local markets,” he said. “We think it will be both linear in the traditional cable bundle and digitally on our own platforms, but that remains to be seen.”Diamond said as of Sept. 30 it had debt of $8.674 billion. It has nearly $1 billion in rights payments, mostly to baseball teams, due in the first quarter this year.“Our Bally RSNs have been negatively impacted by elevated levels of subscriber erosion which we believe was influenced in part by shifting consumer behaviors resulting from media fragmentation, the current economic environment and related uncertainties,"" Diamond said in its financial statement for the quarter ending Sept. 30. “These factors are expected to have a negative impact on future projected revenues and margins of our Bally RSNs.""Story continuesSinclair Broadcast Group bought the regional sports networks from The Walt Disney Co. for nearly $10 billion in 2019. Disney was required by the Department of Justice to sell the networks for its acquisition of 21st Century Fox’s film and television assets to be approved.If Diamond Sports Group doesn't pay its MLB teams, Manfred said the clubs will terminate their contracts with the company.“We’ve been really clear that if Diamond doesn’t pay under every single one of the broadcast agreements, that creates a termination right, and our clubs will proceed to terminate those contracts,” Manfred said.“In the event that MLB stepped in, what we would do is we would produce the games, we would make use of our asset with the MLB Network to do that, we would go directly to distributors, Comcast, Charter, the big distributors, and make an agreement to have those games distributed on cable networks,” he added. ""We would also be seeking flexibility on the digital side so that, when you look at MLB.TV, you could buy your out-of-market package like you always had but have the option to buy up into in-market games, something the fan has never had before, which I see as a huge improvement for fans.”Manfred said he sees a future for regional sports networks in cable bundles, but smaller than it was in its heyday.“It's really important for the game to preserve the economics in the remaining RSN cable bundle while developing a digital alternative that has more flexibility and gives us better reach in terms of getting to fans who want to watch and don't have the ability to watch,” he said.If MLB does take over distribution from Diamond, Manfred said it would not be able to replace 100% of the revenue in the short term. Increasing distribution is MLB's goal.“Blackouts are the kind of opposite side of the coin of reach,"" he said. ""We need to deliver product to fans who want to watch on platforms that they customarily use at a realistic price. That is our No. 1 priority.”___AP sports: https://apnews.com/hub/sports and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports]"

For more companies, head on over to 5 Most Profitable SaaS Companies for 2023. The growth in computing power over the past couple of decades has revolutionized the matter in which both companies and individuals live their lives and run their businesses. While computers of the past were limited to large facilities where researchers or others had to physically relocate themselves, nowadays, vast amounts of computing power are available right in the palm of a hand.As an example, the Apple A15 Bionic chip that is used in the latest iPhone models has a whopping 15 billion transistors on a die area of 107 mm², while one of the first processors, Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC)'s Intel 4004 had a mere 2,300 transistors with a die size of 12 mm². In terms of computing power, this has increased beyond comprehension, since while the 4004 was able to compute a respectable 92,000 instructions per second, the A15's Neural Engine goes as high as being able to crunch 15.8 trillion operations per second.This growth in computing has created new industries of its own, one of which is the Software as a Service (SaaS) sector. Broadly speaking, SaaS covers all firms that host software on their own hardware and then provide a subscription based service to customers willing to use the products. This has a variety of benefits for the customer, as it saves the costs of setting up expensive hardware and generates flexibility in usage since anyone with an Internet connection can use the service. Yet, this flexibility also comes with some drawbacks such as the lack of control over how the service operates and privacy concerns as data is stored in an external server.These compelling benefits have also led to sterling valuations for the SaaS sector. For instance, a research report from Industry Research released in November 2022, believes that the industry was worth $96 billion in 2022 and will grow at a compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) of 15.9% and be worth an estimated $235 billion by the end of 2028. While this might sound a bit less when comes to the technology industry, it is important to keep in mind that the SaaS industry is primarily a software arena that does not have any major and expensive hardware products to drive up its value. The research firm segments the market along several different areas such as public, private, and hybrid clouds alongside pureplay SaaS products. It also lists the major applications that SaaS covers, with some of these being customer relationship management (CRM), supply chain management (SCM), and enterprise resource planning (ERP).Story continuesAnother report, this time from SkyQuest Technology Consulting, has even stronger hopes for the sector. It outlines that the SaaS industry was worth $147 billion in 2021 and will grow at a CAGR of 25.8% between 2022 and 2028 to be worth a whopping $720 billion by the end of the forecast period. The firm believes that the onset of the coronavirus pandemic stimulated the industry as it made firms increase the rate at which they digitized their operations and shares that globally, the growth in the use of computers, cell phones, and other technology products is driving the industry's growth.Focusing on the current state of the industry, one SaaS platform that you should have come across by now is ChatGPT. The conversation chatbox that took the Internet by storm has several characteristics which make it the perfect SaaS application. ChatGPT is hosted on a central server and users create an account to access it and use its services over the Internet - in an atypical definition of how SaaS works. In fact, the amalgamation of artificial intelligence into SaaS is a hot topic these days in the industry, particularly due to the lucrative nature of the industry itself. The standalone AI industry, according to Grand View Market Research, can be worth as much as $1.8 trillion by 2030, and some of the ways in which it is making its way into the SaaS sector are improving customer experience through personalization, speeding up processes, improving threat detection, and generating new insights through identifying trends.These factors, combined with the fact that global cloud spending slowed down to 30% for the first time in history last year due to high inflation merits a look at the SaaS industry to sift out which companies are actually making shareholders money in terms of earnings per share. Some of the top performers are Adobe Inc. (NASDAQ:ADBE), Intuit Inc. (NASDAQ:INTU), and Box, Inc. (NYSE:BOX).10 Profitable SaaS Companies for 2023Copyright: ralwel / 123RF Stock PhotoOur Methodology We took a broad look at the technology industry to sift out which companies provide SaaS products and services to their customers and earn most of their revenue from it.

281,293b3456-5ccf-3075-8704-9001dcc88f85,AKAM,2023-02-16,Akamai stock falls despite Q4 earnings beat,Yahoo Finance Video,https://finance.yahoo.com/video/akamai-stock-falls-despite-q4-144602690.html,1676472362,VIDEO,['AKAM'],"[Yahoo Finance Live anchors discuss the decline in stock for Akamai following fourth-quarter earnings.Video Transcript[AUDIO LOGO]- Let's talk and go full into the nerd scope here. Akamai, topped estimates in its latest quarter. However, its delivery revenue, that saw a 12% year over year decline for the quarter, and an 11% revenue decline for 2022. Shares are seeing some pressure this morning. They're down by about 7.6%. They were actually down earlier this morning by about 5%. So a little bit of a leg lower here.There is one element that kind of stuck out to me. I listened to a snippet of this company's earnings call as well this morning in the replay. They're really focused on just taking a snippet of the market share away from Amazon in the compute business. And that compute revenue, it doesn't make up the largest amount of revenue. In fact, it makes up the smallest amount of revenue for them. But that compute revenue, if they just take a 1% to 2% share of a $200 billion total addressable market, then that is major for their business as compared to what it would be for Amazon.- Yeah. I love that Akamai logo. Reminds me of a stamp that should be on a bright blue '87 Ford Mustang. That's just my own personal take. It's the first thing that popped in my head when we showed it. But look, with this quarter too, security revenue being called out as a weak point. Missed consensus estimates. The team over Guggenheim calling that out. I will be interesting just because of that miss on security, how Okta is doing. Later on in the 3:00 to 5:00 show, I think we're talking to Okta CEO, Todd McKinnon. Curious as to what he's seeing in his own security business.- Yeah. I mean, I would echo what you guys were saying, that if they're going toe-to-toe with the likes of the big players here, then--- Yeah. I mean, it sounds like they're not even trying to go full toe-to-toe. It's kind of like, hey, we understand that you guys want the whole loaf of bread. We just want a couple of crumbs that might fall off the side. And honestly with the company acquiring Linode, and the cloud-computing platform last year for around $900 million. To close that gap, I think particularly just going after a percentage of that market share could be really critical for how that builds out their own business, and what it contributes to getting to this 30% margin target that they set out. Right now, sitting at about 27%.Story continues- You listen to this whole earnings call? Was it a snoozer?- I put it on--- It's internet plumbing.- I put it on 1 and 1/2 speed.[LAUGHTER]I listened to it that way. Yeah.- When did you even have time to do that?- He does it all. He's rocking. Crushing on Airbnb earnings last night. Valentine's Day dinner. Hopping on an internet plumbing earnings call.- Get your good Brooklyn Bagel Company, local small business coffee and--- Crushing.- --ripping. Ripping this morning.- Home run.-All right.]"

284,00db6b27-d925-36a2-a0d2-feb527fe0772,FFIV,2023-02-16,"F5, Inc.'s (NASDAQ:FFIV) Stock Has Shown A Decent Performance: Have Financials A Role To Play?",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/f5-inc-nasdaq-ffiv-stock-122018170.html,1676550018,STORY,['FFIV'],"[Most readers would already know that F5's (NASDAQ:FFIV) stock increased by 1.4% over the past week. Given that stock prices are usually aligned with a company's financial performance in the long-term, we decided to investigate if the company's decent financials had a hand to play in the recent price move. Particularly, we will be paying attention to F5's  ROE today.ROE or return on equity is a useful tool to assess how effectively a company can generate returns on the investment it received from its shareholders. Put another way, it reveals the company's success at turning shareholder investments into profits. Check out our latest analysis for F5 How Do You Calculate Return On Equity?The formula for ROE is:Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' EquitySo, based on the above formula, the ROE for F5 is:12% = US$301m ÷ US$2.6b (Based on the trailing twelve months to December 2022).The 'return' refers to a company's earnings over the last year. So, this means that for every $1 of its shareholder's investments, the company generates a profit of $0.12.What Is The Relationship Between ROE And Earnings Growth?Thus far, we have learned that ROE measures how efficiently a company is generating its profits. Depending on how much of these profits the company reinvests or ""retains"", and how effectively it does so, we are then able to assess a company’s earnings growth potential. Generally speaking, other things being equal, firms with a high return on equity and profit retention, have a higher growth rate than firms that don’t share these attributes.F5's Earnings Growth And 12% ROETo start with, F5's ROE looks acceptable. And on comparing with the industry, we found that the the average industry ROE is similar at 10%. However, while F5 has a pretty respectable ROE, its five year net income decline rate was 9.6% . Based on this, we feel that there might be other reasons which haven't been discussed so far in this article that could be hampering the company's growth. These include low earnings retention or poor allocation of capital.Story continuesThat being said, we compared F5's performance with the industry and were concerned when we found that while the company has shrunk its earnings, the industry has grown its earnings at a rate of 24% in the same period.past-earnings-growthEarnings growth is an important metric to consider when valuing a stock. What investors need to determine next is if the expected earnings growth, or the lack of it, is already built into the share price. This then helps them determine if the stock is placed for a bright or bleak future. Is F5 fairly valued compared to other companies? These 3 valuation measures might help you decide.Is F5 Using Its Retained Earnings Effectively?F5 doesn't pay any dividend, meaning that the company is keeping all of its profits, which makes us wonder why it is retaining its earnings if it can't use them to grow its business. It looks like there might be some other reasons to explain the lack in that respect. For example, the business could be in decline.ConclusionIn total, it does look like F5 has some positive aspects to its business. Although, we are disappointed to see a lack of growth in earnings even in spite of a high ROE and and a high reinvestment rate. We believe that there might be some outside factors that could be having a negative impact on the business. Having said that, looking at current analyst estimates, we found that the company's earnings growth rate is expected to see a huge improvement.

285,7370ed11-ed68-3fd6-8e4b-02751f853ad6,FFIV,2023-02-16,10 Profitable SaaS Companies for 2023,Insider Monkey,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/10-profitable-saas-companies-2023-224937964.html,1676501377,STORY,"['NOW', 'ADBE', 'BOX', 'DBX', 'VEEV', 'INTU', 'AKAM', 'FFIV']","[In this piece, we will take a look at the ten most profitable SaaS companies for 2023. For more companies, head on over to 5 Most Profitable SaaS Companies for 2023. The growth in computing power over the past couple of decades has revolutionized the matter in which both companies and individuals live their lives and run their businesses. While computers of the past were limited to large facilities where researchers or others had to physically relocate themselves, nowadays, vast amounts of computing power are available right in the palm of a hand.As an example, the Apple A15 Bionic chip that is used in the latest iPhone models has a whopping 15 billion transistors on a die area of 107 mm², while one of the first processors, Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC)'s Intel 4004 had a mere 2,300 transistors with a die size of 12 mm². In terms of computing power, this has increased beyond comprehension, since while the 4004 was able to compute a respectable 92,000 instructions per second, the A15's Neural Engine goes as high as being able to crunch 15.8 trillion operations per second.This growth in computing has created new industries of its own, one of which is the Software as a Service (SaaS) sector. Broadly speaking, SaaS covers all firms that host software on their own hardware and then provide a subscription based service to customers willing to use the products. This has a variety of benefits for the customer, as it saves the costs of setting up expensive hardware and generates flexibility in usage since anyone with an Internet connection can use the service. Yet, this flexibility also comes with some drawbacks such as the lack of control over how the service operates and privacy concerns as data is stored in an external server.These compelling benefits have also led to sterling valuations for the SaaS sector. For instance, a research report from Industry Research released in November 2022, believes that the industry was worth $96 billion in 2022 and will grow at a compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) of 15.9% and be worth an estimated $235 billion by the end of 2028. While this might sound a bit less when comes to the technology industry, it is important to keep in mind that the SaaS industry is primarily a software arena that does not have any major and expensive hardware products to drive up its value. The research firm segments the market along several different areas such as public, private, and hybrid clouds alongside pureplay SaaS products. It also lists the major applications that SaaS covers, with some of these being customer relationship management (CRM), supply chain management (SCM), and enterprise resource planning (ERP).Story continuesAnother report, this time from SkyQuest Technology Consulting, has even stronger hopes for the sector. It outlines that the SaaS industry was worth $147 billion in 2021 and will grow at a CAGR of 25.8% between 2022 and 2028 to be worth a whopping $720 billion by the end of the forecast period. The firm believes that the onset of the coronavirus pandemic stimulated the industry as it made firms increase the rate at which they digitized their operations and shares that globally, the growth in the use of computers, cell phones, and other technology products is driving the industry's growth.Focusing on the current state of the industry, one SaaS platform that you should have come across by now is ChatGPT. The conversation chatbox that took the Internet by storm has several characteristics which make it the perfect SaaS application. ChatGPT is hosted on a central server and users create an account to access it and use its services over the Internet - in an atypical definition of how SaaS works. In fact, the amalgamation of artificial intelligence into SaaS is a hot topic these days in the industry, particularly due to the lucrative nature of the industry itself. The standalone AI industry, according to Grand View Market Research, can be worth as much as $1.8 trillion by 2030, and some of the ways in which it is making its way into the SaaS sector are improving customer experience through personalization, speeding up processes, improving threat detection, and generating new insights through identifying trends.These factors, combined with the fact that global cloud spending slowed down to 30% for the first time in history last year due to high inflation merits a look at the SaaS industry to sift out which companies are actually making shareholders money in terms of earnings per share. Some of the top performers are Adobe Inc. (NASDAQ:ADBE), Intuit Inc. (NASDAQ:INTU), and Box, Inc.

Quarterly earnings and net sales surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate and increased on a year-over-year basis.Despite lower volumes, high costs and unfavorable currency, strong pricing helped the company generate higher earnings.Owens Corning's shares dropped 0.2% in the pre-market trading session on Feb 15, after the earnings release. Investors’ sentiment might have been hurt by tepid first-quarter 2023 net sales and EBIT guidance.Looking forward, Brian Chambers, OC’s board chair and chief executive officer, stated, “While we anticipate our markets in 2023 will be more challenging, we remain focused on outperforming the market and delivering value for our shareholders.”Inside the HeadlinesThe company reported adjusted earnings of $2.49 per share, which topped the consensus mark of $2.34 by 6.4% and increased 13% from $2.20 a year ago.Owens Corning Inc Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise Owens Corning Inc Price, Consensus and EPS SurpriseOwens Corning Inc price-consensus-eps-surprise-chart | Owens Corning Inc Quote Net sales of $2.29 billion beat the consensus mark of $2.26 billion by 1.1% and increased 7% year over year. The uptick was mainly backed by the strength of the Insulation and Roofing businesses.Segment DetailsNet sales in the Composites segment decreased 3% year over year to $589 million. This was due to lower volumes and unfavorable currency translation, which were partially offset by higher selling prices. Earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT) margin of 11% contracted by 500 basis points (bps) from the year-ago quarter’s levels. Input cost inflation, reduced sales and the impact of production downtime and other manufacturing costs hurt margins.The Insulation segment’s net sales came in at $956 million, up 11% year over year on higher selling prices and the acquisition of Natural Polymers, partially offset by lower volumes and unfavorable currency translation. EBIT increased to $153 million and the EBIT margin of 16% increased by 100 bps.The Roofing segment’s net sales rose 12% year over year to $799 million, driven by higher selling prices and partially offset by lower sales volume. EBIT increased to $168 million. EBIT margin remained unchanged from the prior year at 21%. Higher selling prices were partially offset by cost inflation, primarily asphalt and other manufacturing costs and lower volumes.Story continuesOperating HighlightsAdjusted EBIT and adjusted EBITDA rose 2% each on a year-over-year basis. Adjusted EBIT margins remained flat from the year-ago figure of 15%, but adjusted EBITDA contracted 100 bps to 20%.2022 HighlightsAdjusted earnings came in at $12.88 per share for the year, up 39% from 2021.

In December 2022, OC announced an additional share repurchase authorization for up to 10 million shares of its common stock. At the end of 2022, 14.4 million shares were available under the combined authorization.OutlookOwens Corning's businesses primarily depend on residential repair and remodeling activity, U.S. housing starts, global commercial construction activity and global industrial production.The company expects challenges in many of its end markets due to inflationary pressure, higher interest rates and continued geopolitical uncertainties.

But finding a great growth stock is not easy at all.By their very nature, these stocks carry above-average risk and volatility. Moreover, if a company's growth story is over or nearing its end, betting on it could lead to significant loss.However, the Zacks Growth Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which looks beyond the traditional growth attributes to analyze a company's real growth prospects, makes it pretty easy to find cutting-edge growth stocks.Our proprietary system currently recommends Mettler-Toledo (MTD) as one such stock. This company not only has a favorable Growth Score, but also carries a top Zacks Rank.Studies have shown that stocks with the best growth features consistently outperform the market. And returns are even better for stocks that possess the combination of a Growth Score of A or B and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy).While there are numerous reasons why the stock of this maker of precision instruments is a great growth pick right now, we have highlighted three of the most important factors below:Earnings GrowthEarnings growth is arguably the most important factor, as stocks exhibiting exceptionally surging profit levels tend to attract the attention of most investors. For growth investors, double-digit earnings growth is highly preferable, as it is often perceived as an indication of strong prospects (and stock price gains) for the company under consideration.While the historical EPS growth rate for Mettler-Toledo is 18.6%, investors should actually focus on the projected growth. The company's EPS is expected to grow 10.2% this year, crushing the industry average, which calls for EPS growth of 7.7%.Impressive Asset Utilization RatioAsset utilization ratio -- also known as sales-to-total-assets (S/TA) ratio -- is often overlooked by investors, but it is an important indicator in growth investing. This metric exhibits how efficiently a firm is utilizing its assets to generate sales.Story continuesRight now, Mettler-Toledo has an S/TA ratio of 1.16, which means that the company gets $1.16 in sales for each dollar in assets. Comparing this to the industry average of 0.73, it can be said that the company is more efficient.In addition to efficiency in generating sales, sales growth plays an important role. And Mettler-Toledo looks attractive from a sales growth perspective as well. The company's sales are expected to grow 4.4% this year versus the industry average of 1.8%.Promising Earnings Estimate RevisionsSuperiority of a stock in terms of the metrics outlined above can be further validated by looking at the trend in earnings estimate revisions. A positive trend is of course favorable here. Empirical research shows that there is a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.There have been upward revisions in current-year earnings estimates for Mettler-Toledo. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has surged 3.9% over the past month.Bottom LineMettler-Toledo has not only earned a Growth Score of A based on a number of factors, including the ones discussed above, but it also carries a Zacks Rank #2 because of the positive earnings estimate revisions.You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.This combination indicates that Mettler-Toledo is a potential outperformer and a solid choice for growth investors.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Operating loss of $125.7 million, or -7.5% operating profit margin, and adjusted operating profit of $269.2 million, or 16.0% adjusted operating profit margin.""As we announced previously, our fourth quarter and full-year 2022 results came in below our expectations,"" said Chris Cocks, Hasbro chief executive officer. ""Despite this, we delivered our first billion-dollar brand in MAGIC: THE GATHERING and another record year at Wizards of the Coast and Digital Gaming, we grew key investment areas including licensing and direct to consumer, and we improved adjusted operating profit margin. We also reduced owned and retail inventory levels from the third quarter peak and we are working to reduce them further this year. Only a few months in, we have made meaningful progress in implementing Blueprint 2.0 with a heightened focus on innovation, data driven investment in key brands and disciplined cost management.""""For 2023, we have a focused plan to grow share in our key categories and further improve our margins. We are capitalizing on a fantastic entertainment slate, including Dungeons &amp; Dragons: Honor Among Thieves in March and exciting new product launches, while facing a challenging consumer discretionary environment and approximately $300 million in revenue headwinds from exited licenses, brands and markets as well as foreign exchange,"" said Cocks. ""Our strategy is centered on what makes our brands great - play, supported by compelling storytelling and disciplined brand management.""Story continues""We are making significant headway in the execution of Blueprint 2.0 - including investing in higher return brands and projects, ending low return initiatives, modernizing our organization and lowering our cost base,"" said Deborah Thomas, Hasbro chief financial officer. ""We forecasted a challenging 2022, and that came to fruition. We also invested to grow, including the $146 million acquisition of D&amp;D Beyond, which was earnings accretive in Q4, and returned $510 million to shareholders through dividends and share repurchase. Our current cash position adequately supports our business needs in the short-term, and operating cash flow is expected to nearly double in 2023.""Fourth Quarter and Full-Year 2022 Financial Results$ Millions, except earnings per shareQ4 2022Q4 2021% ChangeFY 2022FY 2021% ChangeNet Revenues1$1,678.5$2,013.4-17%$5,856.7$6,420.4-9%Operating Profit (Loss)$(125.7)$171.5&gt;-100%$407.7$763.3-47%Adjusted Operating Profit2$269.2$219.922%$922.5$995.2-7%Net Earnings (Loss)$(128.9)$82.2&gt;-100%$203.5$428.7-53%Net Earnings (Loss) per Diluted Share$(0.93)$0.59&gt;-100%$1.46$3.10-53%Adjusted Net Earnings2$181.9$168.48%$618.1$723.4-15%Adjusted Net Earnings per Diluted Share2$1.31$1.218%$4.45$5.23-15%EBITDA2$(61.4)$203.9&gt;-100%$665.1$1,041.7-36%Adjusted EBITDA2$327.2$306.57%$1,173.1$1,310.2-10%1Foreign exchange had a negative $62.5 million impact, or 3%, on fourth quarter 2022 revenue and a negative $166.3 million impact, or 3%, on full-year 2022 revenue.2See the financial tables accompanying this press release for a reconciliation of GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures.Fourth quarter and full-year 2022 net earnings were impacted by the following after-tax amounts, which are excluded from adjusted net earnings, respectively:$228.3 million and $231.9 million for the quarter and full-year 2022, respectively, of asset impairments and charges related to the Company's Blueprint 2.0 strategy focused on fewer, bigger brands. In the fourth quarter 2022 these charges primarily relate to a non-cash charge of $215.2 million related to a partial impairment of POWER RANGERS due to changes in entertainment strategy and plans; and incremental asset charges related to exiting brands, consisting of inventory and asset write offs of $13.1 million.Charges of $64.6 million and $89.2 million for the fourth quarter and full-year 2022, respectively, related to severance and other employee charges, consultant fees and the program transformation office associated with the Company's Operational Excellence program.A full-year charge of $21.1 million related to the loss on the sale of non-core businesses within the Entertainment segment.$13.9 million and $59.4 million of acquired intangible amortization and $4.0 million and $12.9 million of acquisition-related costs in the fourth quarter and full-year 2022, respectively, in connection with the eOne acquisition.Fourth Quarter and Full-Year 2022 Brand Portfolio PerformanceBrand Performance ($ Millions)Net RevenuesQ4 2022Q4 2021% ChangeFY 2022FY 2021% ChangeFranchise Brands1$729.5$830.2-12%$2,830.6$2,955.6-4%Partner Brands$276.2$394.3-30%$1,052.0$1,161.0-9%Hasbro Gaming2$262.6$286.1-8%$743.3$851.4-13%Emerging Brands$110.3$157.5-30%$402.1$454.7-12%TV/Film/Entertainment$299.9$345.3-13%$828.7$997.7-17%1Effective in the first quarter of 2022, the Company moved PEPPA PIG into Franchise Brands from Emerging Brands. For comparability, fourth quarter and full-year 2021 net revenues have been restated to reflect the elevation of PEPPA PIG from Emerging Brands into Franchise Brands resulting in a change of $60.9 million and $162.9 million, respectively.2Hasbro's total gaming category, including all gaming revenue, most notably MAGIC: THE GATHERING and MONOPOLY, totaled $581.8 million for the fourth quarter 2022, up 5% versus the fourth quarter 2021 and $1,997.5 million, down 5% versus the full-year 2021.MAGIC: THE GATHERING had a record year and exceeded $1 billion in revenue for the first time, led by strong growth in tabletop gaming. Each tent pole set release through the first three quarters crossed $100 million in revenue for the first time and the fourth quarter release, The Brothers War, is on track to do so in 2023. Warhammer 40K Universes Beyond Commander deck was reprinted three times to meet robust player demand and Dominaria Remastered released on January 13, 2023 and was supported by initial shipments in the fourth quarter of 2022.Net Revenues$ MillionsQ4 2022% ChangeFY 2022% ChangeMAGIC: THE GATHERING$263.20+40%$1,065.20+7%PEPPA PIG and PLAY-DOH, including the holiday feature item PLAY-DOH Ice Cream Truck, were also strong performers in 2022. Hasbro products for the partner brand Marvel portfolio delivered a record year and Hasbro's product revenue for Star Wars was up year-over-year. Despite growth in select new items, declines in NERF, Hasbro Gaming and the transition out of select licenses contributed to lower revenue.Company OutlookReflecting on the current environment and an expected flat to declining toy and game market in 2023, the Company's full-year 2023 guidance includes:Revenue down low-single digitsAdjusted operating profit margin expansion of 50 to 70 basis points, excluding Operational Excellence charges and other non-GAAP items1Adjusted earnings per diluted share in the range of $4.45 to $4.55Adjusted EBITDA approximately flat with 2022 Adjusted EBITDAOperating cash flow in the range of $600 to $700 million1The Company is not able to reconcile its forward-looking non-GAAP adjusted operating profit margin, adjusted earnings per diluted share and adjusted EBITDA measures because the Company cannot predict with certainty the timing and amounts of discrete items such as charges associated with its cost-savings program, which could impact GAAP results.Given the full-year 2022 results and its progress on implementing Blueprint 2.0, Hasbro updated its medium and long-term outlook with the following financial targets:Mid-single digit revenue CAGR through 2027High-single digit operating profit CAGR to achieve 20% adjusted operating profit margin by full-year 2027Operating cash flow improvement with a target of $1 billion annually by full-year 2025$250-$300 million annualized run-rate cost savings by year-end 2025Targets are based off 2022 results and do not reflect the potential sale of select entertainment assets. The Company plans to update its outlook upon completion of this process if it results in the sale of non-core entertainment assets.Blueprint 2.0 &amp; Operational ExcellenceAt the Company's investor day on October 4, 2022, Hasbro unveiled its Blueprint 2.0. This new consumer-centric approach focuses on fewer, bigger brands, expanded licensing, branded entertainment, and driving high-margin growth in games, digital and direct to consumer.In support of the Blueprint 2.0, Hasbro announced an Operational Excellence program to deliver $250-300 million in annualized run-rate cost savings by year-end 2025. In 2022, $50 million of run-rate cost savings was achieved with $20 million of actualized savings. The Company remains on track to achieve $150 million in run-rate cost savings for the full-year 2023. Expected cash costs to implement the program are approximately $200 million, of which $15 million was spent in 2022. A $89.2 million after-tax charge was recorded in the full-year 2022 primarily from workforce reductions and related fees associated with the execution of the Blueprint 2.0 strategy.Fourth Quarter and Full-Year 2022 Major Segment PerformanceQ4 2022 Major Segments ($ Millions)Net RevenuesOperating Profit(Loss)AdjustedOperating Profit1Q4 2022Q4 2021% ChangeQ4 2022Q4 2021Q4 2022Q4 2021Consumer Products$1,004.7$1,355.8-26%$78.4$140.9$102.1$140.9Wizards of the Coast and Digital Gaming$339.0$277.922%$104.1$84.7$104.1$84.7Entertainment$334.8$379.7-12%$25.1$(17.5)$32.7$8.2Q4 2022 Major Segments ($ Millions)EBITDAAdjusted EBITDA1Q4 2022Q4 2021Q4 2022Q4 2021Consumer Products$141.8$173.0$165.7$182.0Wizards of the Coast and Digital Gaming$110.5$103.6$115.9$107.0Entertainment$40.0$8.4$45.9$20.91Reconciliations are included in the attached schedules under the heading ""Reconciliation of Adjusted Operating Profit"" and ""Reconciliation of EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA.""FY 2022 Major Segments ($ Millions)Net RevenuesOperating Profit(Loss)AdjustedOperating Profit1FY 2022FY 2021% ChangeFY 2022FY 2021FY 2022FY 2021Consumer Products$3,572.5$3,981.6-10%$217.3$401.4$269.9$401.4Wizards of the Coast and Digital Gaming$1,325.1$1,286.63%$538.3$547.0$538.3$547.0Entertainment$959.1$1,152.2-17%$22.7$(91.8)$82.6$102.1FY 2022 Major Segments ($ Millions)EBITDAAdjusted EBITDA1FY 2022FY 2021FY 2022FY 2021Consumer Products$442.7$532.5$491.2$565.1Wizards of the Coast and Digital Gaming$549.7$593.7$570.1$606.1Entertainment$85.3$33.5$135.9$162.31Reconciliations are included in the attached schedules under the heading ""Reconciliation of Adjusted Operating Profit"" and ""Reconciliation of EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA.""Full-Year 2022 Segment Commentary &amp; 2023 OutlookConsumer Products segment revenues decreased 10%.Revenue decreased 7% excluding a negative $117.5 million impact of foreign exchange, $92.3 million of which was in Europe.The segment's decline in adjusted operating profit is the result of lower revenue as well as higher allowances, close outs and warehousing costs associated with higher inventory levels. These items were partially offset by savings realized from the Company’s Operational Excellence program within cost of sales and distribution expense, as well as lower air freight, royalties, advertising and incentive compensation expenses.For the full year 2023, revenue is expected to decline mid-single digits from full-year 2022 with adjusted operating profit margin improvement of 150 to 200 basis points from the adjusted 7.6% in 2022.Wizards of the Coast and Digital Gaming segment revenues increased 3%.Revenues increased 5% excluding a negative $27.9 million impact of foreign exchange.Tabletop gaming revenue increased 12%, more than offsetting the 23% decline in digital revenue due to fewer new digital gaming releases in 2022 versus 2021.Operating profit of $538.3 million was down 2% and reflects higher product cost, royalties due to Universes Beyond growth and product development. These items were partially offset by lower costs associated with the digital game Dark Alliance that released in 2021 as well as lower incentive compensation.For the full year 2023, we expect mid-single digit revenue growth. Operating profit margin is expected to be in the high 30% range as we continue to build on the Universes Beyond franchise and invest for long-term growth in these valuable brands.Entertainment segment revenue decreased 17% and was down 12% excluding $65 million of music revenue associated with the business sold in 2021.Revenues declined 15%, excluding a negative $21.0 million impact of foreign exchange.Film &amp; TV revenue declined 10% reflecting lower film revenues with fewer new releases in 2022 vs. 2021 and the timing of deliveries. TV revenues increased behind strong scripted TV deliveries.Family Brands revenue declined 40% primarily due to the delivery of My Little Pony: A New Generation film in the third quarter 2021 which did not have a comparable film in 2022.Music and Other declined, including $65 million of revenues associated with the music business sold in 2021.Adjusted operating profit decreased 19% on lower revenues. These declines were partially offset by reductions in royalty, advertising and promotion, and incentive compensation expense.For the full-year 2023, we expect revenue to increase low-single digits and adjusted operating profit margin is expected to increase slightly from 8.6% in 2022. Guidance will be updated upon completion of the sale process of our non-core entertainment assets.Capital Priorities and DividendDuring the fourth quarter, Hasbro paid $96.7 million in cash dividends to shareholders. For the full-year 2022, the Company paid $385.3 million in cash dividends to shareholders. The next dividend of $0.70 per common share was previously declared and will be payable on May 15, 2023 to shareholders of record at the close of business on May 1, 2023.Given the progress made toward reducing debt, the Company repurchased 1.4 million shares of Hasbro common stock at a total price of $125.0 million during the full-year 2022. $241.6 million remains available in the Company's share repurchase program.The Company continues to target Debt to EBITDA of 2.0 to 2.5 times. For 2023, progress is expected against this target. Pending the outcome of the sale of non-core film and TV assets, the Company anticipates prioritizing the sale proceeds toward paying down debt. The Company remains committed to maintaining our investment grade rating.Conference Call WebcastHasbro will webcast its fourth quarter and full-year 2022 earnings conference call at 8:30 a.m. Eastern Time today.

We undertake no obligation to make any revisions to the forward-looking statements contained in this press release or to update them to reflect events or circumstances occurring after the date of this press release.Non-GAAP Financial MeasuresThe financial tables accompanying this press release include non-GAAP financial measures as defined under SEC rules, specifically Adjusted operating profit, Adjusted net earnings and Adjusted net earnings per diluted share, which exclude, where applicable, acquisition and related costs, acquired intangible amortization, Blueprint 2.0 implementation charges; Operational Excellence charges as well as 2021 losses on the music sale and charges from UK tax reform. Also included in this press release are the non-GAAP financial measures of EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA. EBITDA represents net earnings attributable to Hasbro, Inc. excluding interest expense, income tax expense, net earnings (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interests, depreciation and amortization of intangibles. Segment EBITDA represents segment operating profit (loss) plus other income or expense, less depreciation and amortization of intangibles. Adjusted EBITDA also excludes Blueprint 2.0 implementation charges, Operational Excellence charges and the impact of stock compensation (including acquisition-related stock expense). As required by SEC rules, we have provided reconciliations on the attached schedules of these measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measure. Management believes that Adjusted net earnings, Adjusted net earnings per diluted share and Adjusted operating profit provide investors with an understanding of the underlying performance of our business absent unusual events. Management believes that EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are appropriate measures for evaluating the operating performance of our business because they reflect the resources available for strategic opportunities including, among others, to invest in the business, strengthen the balance sheet and make strategic acquisitions. The impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates used to translate the consolidated statements of operations is quantified by translating the current period revenues at the prior period exchange rates and comparing this amount to the prior period reported revenues. The Company believes that the presentation of the impact of changes in exchange rates, which are beyond the Company’s control, is helpful to an investor’s understanding of the performance of the underlying business. These non-GAAP measures should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for, or superior to, net earnings or other measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP as more fully discussed in our consolidated financial statements and filings with the SEC. As used herein, ""GAAP"" refers to accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.HAS-E(Tables Attached)HASBRO, INC.CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS(Unaudited)(Millions of Dollars)December 25, 2022December 26, 2021ASSETSCash and Cash Equivalents$513.1$1,019.2Accounts Receivable, Net1,132.41,500.4Inventories676.8552.1Prepaid Expenses and Other Current Assets676.8656.4Total Current Assets2,999.13,728.1Property, Plant and Equipment, Net422.8421.1Goodwill3,470.13,419.6Other Intangible Assets, Net814.61,172.0Other Assets1,589.31,297.0Total Assets$9,295.9$10,037.8LIABILITIES, NONCONTROLLING INTERESTS AND SHAREHOLDERS' EQUITYShort-Term Borrowings$142.4$0.8Current Portion of Long-Term Debt113.2200.1Accounts Payable and Accrued Liabilities1,934.12,255.0Total Current Liabilities2,189.72,455.9Long-Term Debt3,711.23,824.2Other Liabilities533.1670.7Total Liabilities6,434.06,950.8Redeemable Noncontrolling Interests—23.9Total Shareholders' Equity2,861.93,063.1Total Liabilities, Noncontrolling Interests and Shareholders' Equity$9,295.9$10,037.8HASBRO, INC.CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF OPERATIONS(Unaudited)(Millions of Dollars and Shares Except Per Share Data)Quarter EndedYear EndedDecember 25, 2022% Net RevenuesDecember 26, 2021% Net RevenuesDecember 25, 2022% Net RevenuesDecember 26, 2021% Net RevenuesNet Revenues$1,678.5100.0%$2,013.4100.0%$5,856.7100.0%$6,420.4100.0%Costs and Expenses:Cost of Sales580.634.6%683.133.9%1,911.832.6%1,927.530.0%Program Cost Amortization189.811.3%232.511.5%555.59.5%628.69.8%Royalties157.79.4%228.211.3%493.08.4%620.49.7%Product Development76.74.6%86.64.3%307.95.3%315.74.9%Advertising110.36.6%150.07.5%387.36.6%506.67.9%Amortization of Intangibles24.11.4%26.51.3%105.31.8%116.81.8%Selling, Distribution and Administration666.039.7%428.021.3%1,666.128.4%1,432.722.3%Loss on Disposal of Business(1.0)-0.1%7.00.3%22.10.4%108.81.7%Operating Profit (Loss)(125.7)-7.5%171.58.5%407.77.0%763.311.9%Interest Expense45.82.7%42.42.1%171.02.9%179.72.8%Other Expense (Income), Net(7.3)-0.4%41.22.0%(24.8)-0.4%1.70.0%Earnings before Income Taxes(164.2)-9.8%87.94.4%261.54.5%581.99.1%Income Tax Expense (Benefit)(35.6)-2.1%3.10.2%58.51.0%146.62.3%Net Earnings (Loss)(128.6)-7.7%84.84.2%]"

The quarterly results might have been hurt by an elevated operating expense level. A trimmed fiscal 2023 guidance with respect to GMV and revenue is also likely to have raised concerns for investors. Nevertheless, the downside has been partly offset by growing transactions and a significant increase in servicing income.Affirm reported a second-quarter fiscal 2023 adjusted loss of $1.10 per share, which came wider than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of a loss of $1.01 per share. Additionally, the bottom line was wider than the prior-year quarter’s loss of 57 cents per share.Net revenues amounted to $399.6 million, which rose 10.7% year over year in the quarter under review.

He even took a crack at reinventing the Domino's delivery car.In turn, Domino's stock exploded from $12 when he started to about $270 on his way out.Restaurant Brands' most recent results shed light on the work Doyle will have to do on BK and the company's other brands alongside incoming CEO Josh Kobza, who will replace current CEO José Cil in March.Burger King U.S. same-store sales rose 5.3% in the fourth quarter, lagging the 10.3% gain seen over at rival McDonald's (MCD). Profitability for the ""Home of the Whopper"" also continued to be under pressure in 2022 as franchisees battled tougher competition with restaurants that in some cases were in bad need of reinvestment.Doyle says it's important that the company revives the Whopper and improves operations so franchisees see the results and then reinvest in things like digital menu boards and drive-thru technology.Story continues""That's part of the reclaim the flame program,"" Doyle explained. ""Some of [the restaurants], we do need to start from scratch.

Crates were standard for the industry that puts bacon and pork chops on plates around the world, but seen as cruel and unnecessary by a growing mass of critics and consumers.“The writing is on the wall,” McGlone said he told the audience that night.That was 22 years ago. Gestation crates are still widely used by farmers, and McDonald’s still buys meat from them.One big reason the industry has clung to crates is cost. Producers say that changing practices forged over generations will lead to higher prices for meat. Another reason, they say, is confining pregnant pigs keeps them from being harmed by other pigs.“Those things protect sows at their most vulnerable times,” said Steve Meyer, a consulting economist for the National Pork Board and the National Pork Producers Council.That has made it harder for companies like McDonald’s to change. After McGlone’s speech, in January 2001, it would be more than a decade before the fast-food giant committed in 2012 to “ending gestation stall use” — by the end of 2022. The company has missed that self-imposed deadline. Other restaurants and meat producers have also promised to shun crates, but still, they remain ubiquitous.Story continuesThe struggle shows how economics and corporate inertia can stymie change even when it is popular with consumers. The clash has now made its way to the US Supreme Court, where the pork industry is challenging Proposition 12, a California ballot initiative passed in 2018 that banned the sale of uncooked pork from hogs raised with crates that didn’t meet minimum size requirements, effectively ending their use for any producer looking to sell pork in California. The measure was set to go into effect last year, until a court order paused enforcement.California accounts for an estimated 13% of US pork consumption, and nearly all of it comes from elsewhere, allowing the state’s law to impact farms beyond its borders. Combined with the 10 other states that have passed similar laws, by 2026, more than 17% of all hog producers would be subject to a ban if the California measure stands, according to a December report from the US Department of Agriculture.A ruling is expected this term.Momentum against gestation crates has been building for years. In 2002, Florida voters adopted a ban. In 2007, Smithfield Foods pledged to get rid of them. Burger King, Wendy’s Co. and other restaurants followed McDonald’s lead with their own plans to stop buying crate-raised pork.Still, the end of crates looks like a distant prospect, especially in the first weeks of a mother pig’s term. McDonald’s said last February that it would push its 2022 deadline to 2024, and that the crates were only verboten after pregnancy was confirmed—which can take as long as six weeks after insemination. Even billionaire investor Carl Icahn, who lost a proxy fight over the matter last year, was unable to force the company back to its original promise of “ending” the use of crates.A McDonald's spokesperson said the company is making progress toward its 2024 goal.Burger King owner Restaurant Brands International Inc. said that in the US it’s on track to remove confirmed pregnant sows from crates by the end of 2024, and it hopes to eliminate the crates for nonpregnant sows “in the long term.” Wendy’s, which had promised in 2012 to “eliminate the use of sow gestation stalls,” says it has met its commitment — but that it was and had always been just for “confirmed pregnant sows.” It didn’t respond to questions about the discrepancy between the original promise and its current policy.Smithfield said it keeps sows in crates for 35 to 42 days after insemination.Gestation crates didn’t become commonplace until they were added to new buildings in the 1980s. But by February 2000, when they appeared on the cover of trade publication National Hog Farmer with the headline “Breeding Herd Efficiency,” they were known for saving space, labor and, ultimately, money.That savings, and the complexity of hog farming, has made the industry reluctant to shift. Pork producers have been slower to change than other farmers, like egg producers, who have been increasing their cage-free accommodations in response to mounting corporate commitments and consumer demand.“A pig is going to be born in one place, moved someplace else and then when it’s slaughtered, there are many pieces to keep track of, so that’s different from an egg-laying hen,” said Maisie Ganzler, who oversees purchasing at Bon Appétit Management Company as chief strategy and brand officer and spent more than 10 years trying to source crate-free pork. She only recently succeeded. (Icahn had called for Ganzler to become a board member at McDonald’s.)Another powerful force preventing a move away from crates could be habit.“It’s stubborn pig farmers, basically,” according to Texas Tech’s McGlone, who says he faced significant pushback from producers after his Manitoba talk.With the California case still to be decided, there are signs that the cost issues pork producers warned about are surfacing. The US hog herd has been shrinking in part due to uncertainty about California’s law, as well as elevated prices for feed and higher levels of pork supply than demand. Once a farm has gone crate-free, it can raise fewer pigs, said Russell Barton, director and product manager at Urner Barry, a food-trade publisher and commodity researcher.“You need to build more space for them to have the same amount of production,” Barton said.But there are also hints that the industry’s approach to crates is evolving.Once the debate was whether gestation crates were a necessity; now the question has turned to how long to use them. In 2012, when McDonald’s said it would eliminate its crates, it told producers sows could stay in crates until they were “confirmed to be pregnant,” according to an April 2022 company filing. Verifying a pregnancy can take as long as 35-40 days. Other producers use them for much shorter periods, about 7-10 days after insemination.Shana Beattie, a fifth generation farmer raising hogs for Smithfield, said she now uses the crates for seven days at most.“Historically we learned that giving pigs individual care and keeping them away from the aggressive behavior was to their benefit,” she said. Now, she keeps them confined only just after insemination. Then, when they’re in a group, Beattie relies on technology such as ear chips to ensure each sow gets enough feed, a common cause of aggression. “We’ve learned that open pen gestation will work.”The need for crates is “overstated,” according to Jim Wallace, senior director of fresh pork at Perdue Farms’ Niman Ranch. Wallace says giving animals more space — and farmers more discretion over how to manage animals — can keep pigs from becoming aggressive and assure pregnancies are successful. Niman Ranch, one of the few truly crate-free pork producers in the US, supplies major companies such as Chipotle Mexican Grill Inc. and Whole Foods Market Inc., as well as high-end chefs.The Supreme Court is considered “unlikely” to rule in California’s favor, according to Bloomberg Intelligence, but there is some expectation that farmers won’t put crates in new buildings, whatever is decided.“If they are building new facilities, they’re going to try to build in that flexibility,” said Christine McCracken, senior analyst for animal protein at Rabobank. “Whether or not these changes are legislated, they are going to try to build in the flexibility in the event customer expectations change over time.”Josh Balk, chief executive officer at the Accountability Board, a nonprofit that tries to hold companies to their ESG commitments, is optimistic about the ruling — and the direction companies are going. He said even McDonald’s position is a big advance from where it was 20 years ago.“There is still a ways to go,” Balk said. “But we should still recognize this improvement.”In 2012, the National Pork Board estimated that moving away from crates would cost between $1.2 billion and $6.1 billion, or as much as 27% of the industry’s sales that year. “The longer the time horizon, the less the cost to producers and consumers,” it said. (The industry pegs the cost to farmers for compliance with Proposition 12 as significantly lower: about $300-$350 million.)McGlone said the industry could have spent the money it used to resist change to implement it. Instead, he said, “they’re fighting it right down to the end.”--With assistance from Dominic Carey.Most Read from Bloomberg BusinessweekZantac’s Maker Kept Quiet About Cancer Risks for 40 YearsAiming to Be the Next Emirates, Air India Makes Record Jet BuyWhat Happens When a Company Sues Itself?Survey Response Rates Are Down Since Covid.

320,58cf6ab9-3250-3c08-ad69-0ffa47b44f23,TRIP,2023-02-16,"Tripadvisor Will Have to Confront the Power of Generative AI, for Better or Worse",Skift,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/tripadvisor-confront-power-generative-ai-070000302.html,1676530800,STORY,"['TRIP', 'GOOGL']","[Travel planning is about to undergo significant change and Tripadvisor thinks it can be in the forefront of the revolution. kitzcorner / Getty ImagesCan you imagine an easier application for generative AI than creating travel itineraries and in-destination tour plans, in particular? One way or another, Tripadvisor will have to deal with this emerging technology because it runs square into the company’s evolving turnaround strategy.During Tripadvisor’s fourth quarter earnings call Wednesday, CEO Matthew Goldberg said an emerging strategy for the company’s core business would be to leverage its trove of reviews and data, and create a differentiated product, including new tools and personalized recommendations for travelers before and during their trips to increase direct engagement with the company.A financial analyst asked Goldberg the implications of generative AI sourcing Tripadvisor’s reviews, which have no paywall to access, “to answer questions for travelers,” obviating the need for travelers to consult Tripadvisor reviews?“You can imagine that over history, when you look at new technologies, people often get really excited in the short term and maybe overestimate what’s going to happen and try to be predictive about that short term, only to underestimate in the long term,” Goldberg said. “So this is one to watch in the long term.”Goldberg said he expects generative AI to be everywhere, but “the key differentiator is the underlying data and content, if you will, that generative AI draws from. People in travel want real recommendations based on what other travelers or experts have done and recommend not just generic thought recommendations.”Search engines wielding generative AI would in theory have to strike a partnership with Tripadvisor to access its reviews and data, although that doesn’t always happen. On the other hand, the new tech could present Tripadvisor with ample licensing opportunities.The Tripadvisor ConundrumThat gets to the heart of the Tripadvisor conundrum. Founded in 2000, Tripadvisor rose to be the largest travel site in the world based on visitors on the strength of its user reviews, but a lot of other companies, including online travel agencies and Google, caught up if not in quantity than in breadth of content. Tripadvisor has been struggling with that development ever since, as well as with Google sweeping in with a competitive product while sabotaging Tripadvisor’s prior advantages in free search engine results in favor of Google’s own commercial travel products.Story continuesOn the other hand, Tripadvisor would argue that its review content is more comprehensive than that of its rivals.Goldberg argued that Tripadvisor is “in a really strong position with the technology,” presumably referring to generative AI, “to take advantage of our vast content asset we have, as you know, over 1 billion reviews. And of course, we’ve got hundreds of millions of members of our audience with unique interests here.”He said Tripadvisor could then “create unique tips, guidance and drive a more personalized experience.”Data, Data, DataEvery major travel company under the Big Dipper touts its data riches and advantages, but few really use the data to maximum effect. With so much user-generated content, professional advice, and other data available, it remains to be seen how differentiated a product and unique value proposition Tripadvisor is capable of unleashing.Goldberg conceded that Tripadvisor has had trouble executing on its plans on the past — before his arrival last year — and it’s his challenge now to turn that around in a meaningful way. He’s beginning that attempt in part by reorganizing the ways the company’s employees are managed.Goldberg said it’s an open question how generative AI would impact major search engines — like Google and Bing (if you can call Bing a significant player) — and Tripadvisor will look to take advantage.“We think it reinforces the imperative of our strategy to build a persistent and direct relationship with the traveler that experiments with content,” he said.Get breaking travel news and exclusive hotel, airline, and tourism research and insights at Skift.com.]"

Pictured is a tour at Parque das Aguas in Paraná, Brazil in 2016. Rosanteur / Flickr.comTripadvisor is overturning the management structure of its operational teams to address a lack of execution and product deficiencies in its core business, which includes click-based hotel advertising, subscriptions and display ads, experiences and dining.That core segment, which doesn’t include the much healthier Viator experiences brand and to a lesser degree dining reservations platform TheFork, saw 2022 revenue of $966 million, and that was still only 79 percent of pre-Covid 2019 levels. The comparison to 2019 isn’t apples to apples because the 2022 figure doesn’t include 4 percent of segment revenue from the divested Smarter Travel and China businesses.In the company’s fourth quarter and full-year 2022 financial results call with analysts, CEO Matthew Goldberg discussed a new operating model that replaces the pandemic-era structure that had Lindsay Nelson as chief experience and brand officer running the business-to-consumer teams, and Chief Commercial Officer Kanika Soni managing the partner-facing business-to-business teams. Nelson left the company a year ago.“We’ve introduced an updated operating model that balances the autonomy and empowerment of P&amp;L ownership with strong functional alignment and collaboration,” Goldberg said. “We’ve added critical new leadership roles and aligned our teams around product, marketing, technology and data, sales and operations. This breaks down silos, and already, we’re seeing improved efficiency and productivity and increased capacity in areas like engineering to reallocate resources to our top strategic priorities.”Goldberg provided few details about the changes other than to say that the company brought in a new chief product officer, whom a spokesperson later declined to name.The Tripadvisor spokesperson did note that Tripadvisor hired John Boris, who worked with Goldberg at Lonely Planet and is a former chief marketing officer at Shutterfly, as chief marketing officer in November, and he oversees both consumer-facing and partner marketing.Story continuesThe global engineering team is functionally led, the spokesperson added.In other changes to a small portion of Tripadvisor’s core segment, the company de-emphasized car rentals, vacation rentals, and flights while retaining cruises. Cruises closed out 2022 at close to 2019 levels, the company said.Tripadvisor’s Viator business reached 171 percent of 2019 levels in 2022 with $493 million in revenue. Meanwhile, TheFork, which primarily runs dining reservations for consumers and restaurants in Europe, where it has a leading position, reached 99 percent of 2019 revenue in 2022 with $126 million revenue despite foreign exchange headwinds.But Goldberg said much of his focus will be on Tripadvisor’s core business, including hotel metasearch, click-based advertising and display ads, and subscriptions. The core business lags pre-pandemic levels as a whole, but elements of it are doing better. The company said its metasearch product in the U.S. exceeded 2019 revenue in the fourth quarter of 2022, although the product globally stood at 93 percent of pre-Covid levels for full-year 2022.There is no “silver bullet” to fix TripAdvisor’s core business, Goldberg said. In fact the performance of the core business, which Tripadvisor Chief Financial Officer Mike Noonan said “saw better-than-expected performance” in the fourth quarter (85 percent of 2019 revenue), actually underperformed the third quarter (89 percent of 2019 revenue).“We set out specifically to put the traveler first, address both opportunities and challenges and drive steady profitable growth,” Goldberg said. “Delivering this outcome is not contingent on a speculative bet, a silver bullet or a risky agenda. Instead, we have high conviction in a strategy grounded in deeper traveler engagement enabled by better products and stronger execution. This builds on our heritage and the reasons travelers come to us in the first place.”Tripadvisor’s full-year 2022 revenue was nearly $1.5 billion, a 65 percent jump. Its net income was $20 million, compared with a $148 million loss in 2021.In the fourth quarter, Tripadvisor narrowed its net loss to $3 million compared with $29 million in the red a year earlier. Fourth quarter revenue increased 47 percent to $354 million.The company’s share price edged upward around 1 percent to $25.38 after its earnings call Wednesday morning.Experimenting With Consumer SubscriptionsGoldberg said the company will continue to experiment with paid subscriptions for consumers; Tripadvisor has long had subscription plans for hotels and restaurants. However, Tripadvisor stopped marketing its Tripadvisor Plus subscription plan for consumers in 2021 when it ran into trouble with the hotel industry over rate parity issues.While not ruling out reviving paid subscriptions for travelers, Goldberg added that the company would likely be leaning toward a free membership program.“As we develop a more persistent relationship with travelers, we’ll be able to offer a clearer path to become a member of our community and earn their loyalty,” Goldberg said. “We see a unique opportunity to recognize and reward travelers for their engagement. And while we will continue to experiment with our paid membership tier, TripAdvisor Plus, we think strengthening the value proposition of a free membership program is the right place to start.”Fraud and Tax IssuesTripadvisor reported that in the fourth quarter it took an $8 million hit because it was the victim of fraud, and refunded subscription monies to a third party. Tripadvisor is trying to recover that money.The company also said it is likely to be adversely impacted in the amount of $25 million to $35 million in the first quarter of 2023 because of an Internal Revenue Service income tax audit of former parent Expedia for the years 2011 to 2019.While these losses adversely impact standard GAAP net income measures, Tripadvisor said it did and will exclude the expenses from its adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) figures. Tripadvisor’s fourth quarter adjusted EBITDA was $43 million, a 48 percent year over year increase.Correction: We erroneously reported that Viator’s 2022 revenue fell just short of pre pandemic levels. In reality, Viator’s 2022 revenue exceeded the 2019 mark by 171 percent. Get breaking travel news and exclusive hotel, airline, and tourism research and insights at Skift.com.]"

If you want to see more stocks in this selection, check out 5 Best Long-Term Stocks To Buy According To Warren Buffett. Berkshire Hathaway’s Warren Buffett is known to shake markets with his investment moves. In Q4 2022, Warren Buffett significantly reduced his investment in Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (NYSE:TSM) only a few months after disclosing a substantial stake. This rapid turnaround by the famous stock picker has spooked investors, and sentiment towards the chip giant has dampened as a result. Berkshire Hathaway reduced its ownership of Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (NYSE:TSM)'s American depositary receipts by 86% in the fourth quarter, according to the latest filings. If Berkshire sold the shares at the average price during that time, the sale of the stake would have raked in $3.7 billion. In the wake of this announcement, the stock prices of the world's largest chip manufacturer declined by up to 4% in Taipei, contributing to widespread losses in the market.Tony Huang, vice president at Taishin Securities Investment Advisory Co, told Bloomberg on February 15: “It’s surprising that Berkshire cut its holding so much in just a quarter, which differs from its past practice of long-term investment and continuing to add shares.”While Berkshire Hathaway opted to sell its holdings in Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (NYSE:TSM), it added 333,856 shares to its position in Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL). For Q4 2022, Apple reported its worst revenue results for a holiday season in seven years.Some of the best long-term stocks to buy according to Warren Buffett include The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO), American Express Company (NYSE:AXP), and Bank of America Corporation (NYSE:BAC). Our MethodologyWe selected the stocks from the Q4 portfolio of Berkshire which have been part of the fund's portfolio for at least 5 years.

The biggest component of this increase was the introduction of a 4% weight in Apple, which is discussed further below. Offsetting this increased tech weight was a 3-percentage point decrease in industrials and a two-percentage point decline in health care. The other two largest purchases include Visa Inc. (NYSE:V) and Abbott Labs which likewise saw their valuations improve as their estimated free cash flows held up or improved while their enterprise values declined.”8. VeriSign, Inc.

DaVita Inc. (NYSE:DVA)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 30Berkshire’s Holding Period: 11 YearsBerkshire’s Stake Value: $2,695,256,212DaVita Inc.

The analyst informed investors that healthcare service providers have been affected by inflationary pressures in 2022, and DaVita has managed these challenges exceptionally well.

For those unfamiliar, kidney dialysis involves the critical removal of toxins, fluids and salts from the blood by artificial means. Roughly 500,000 patients receive kidney dialysis in the U.S., which requires a 3.5-hour treatment three times a week. The only alternatives to the treatments are a kidney transplant or potential fatality. Given the critical nature of its services, demand has little correlation with the overall economy, resulting in a highly recession resistant business.The U.S. dialysis industry is highly concentrated, with two companies (DaVita and its competitor Fresenius) controlling a combined 80% of the $25 billion market. The dominance of this duopoly provides massive scale advantages, making it incredibly difficult for new entrants to gain profitable market share.In the past, DaVita’s valuation has been penalized (we view unfairly) because the company generates a significant portion of its operating income from a small percentage of its patients. Of DaVita’s 200,000 patients, approximately 90% qualify for Medicare (or Medicaid), with the remaining 10% covered by a commercial insurance provider. While commercial insurers pay an average of $1,000 per treatment, the federal government’s pay rate for Medicare and Medicaid is only $275 – which is actually less than what it costs DVA to provide the treatment…”(Click here to read the full text)6. Moody's Corporation (NYSE:MCO)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 63Berkshire’s Holding Period: 12 YearsBerkshire’s Stake Value: $6,873,493,546Moody's Corporation (NYSE:MCO) is a New York-based integrated risk assessment firm that publishes credit ratings and provides assessment services on various debt obligations, programs and facilities, and entities that issue such obligations. Moody's Corporation (NYSE:MCO) has been in the Berkshire portfolio for 12 years. Buffett owns a $6.8 billion position in the company. On January 31, Moody's Corporation (NYSE:MCO) reported a Q4 non-GAAP EPS of $1.60, beating market estimates by $0.13. The revenue of $1.29 billion outperformed Wall Street consensus by $20 million. For FY2023, the company expects revenue to increase in the mid-to-high single digit percent range and adjusted diluted EPS of $9 to $9.50, versus a consensus of $9.28.Ashish Sabadra, an analyst from RBC Capital, increased the target price for Moody's Corporation (NYSE:MCO) on February 1 from $329 to $350 and maintained an Outperform rating on the company's shares after it exceeded Q4 earnings expectations. In a research note to investors, the analyst said that the company's FY23 guidance may be too cautious because of the anticipated strong recovery in issuance. Additionally, RBC Capital thinks that Moody's projected buyback guidance for 2023 is conservative and will result in only about half of its free cash flows being returned to shareholders.According to Insider Monkey’s third quarter database, 63 hedge funds were long Moody's Corporation (NYSE:MCO), compared to 48 funds in the preceding quarter. Chris Hohn’s TCI Fund Management is a significant position holder in the company, with 8.2 million shares worth $2 billion. In addition to The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO), American Express Company (NYSE:AXP), and Bank of America Corporation (NYSE:BAC), Moody's Corporation (NYSE:MCO) has featured on the Berkshire portfolio for several years.  Here is what Qualivian Investment Partners has to say about Moody’s Corporation (NYSE:MCO) in its Q2 2021 investor letter:“Moody’s: Revenue, operating profit margins, and EPS all exceeded expectations, and annual guidance for these items (and for free cash flow) was raised. In MIS (Moody’s Investors Service) which houses the traditional ratings business, the outlook for debt issuance was raised for the remainder of the year, while MA (Moody’s Analytics) also came in ahead of expectations. The company leveraged strong revenue growth with strong operating profit margin improvement of 200 bps, with EPS coming in $0.22 ahead of consensus estimates. Management alluded to having interesting opportunities in their M&amp;A pipeline, which we will have to assess when the time comes, but Moody’s management team has been very effective at allocating capital in the past toward value-creating bolt-on acquisitions, especially in their Moody’s Analytics business, a key growth driver for the company.” Click to continue reading and see 5 Best Long-Term Stocks To Buy According To Warren Buffett.  Suggested articles:13 Stocks Big Short Michael Burry is Buying and Selling10 Jim Cramer Stocks This Month10 Tech Stocks To Sell Now According to Cathie Wood Disclosure: None. 10 Best Long-Term Stocks To Buy According To Warren Buffett is originally published on Insider Monkey.]"

Today's Research Daily features new research reports on 16 major stocks, including Merck &amp; Co., Inc. (MRK), Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc. (TMO) and American Express Co. (AXP). These research reports have been hand-picked from the roughly 70 reports published by our analyst team today.You can see all of today’s research reports here &gt;&gt;&gt;Merck’s shares have outperformed the Zacks Large Cap Pharmaceuticals industry over the past year (+39.8% vs. +11.8%). Drugs like Keytruda and Gardasil (HPV vaccine) have been driving sales. With continued label expansion into new indications &amp; early-stage settings, Keytruda is expected to remain a key top-line driver.Animal health and vaccine products are core growth drivers. Its new COVID oral antiviral pill, Lagevrio, has become a key top-line driver in 2022. Merck boasts a strong cancer pipeline, including Keytruda, which should help drive long-term growth.However, generic competition for several drugs and rising competitive pressure, mainly on the diabetes franchise, will continue to be overhangs on the top line. There are concerns about Merck’s ability to grow its non-oncology business ahead of Keytruda’s loss of exclusivity later in the decade.(You can read the full research report on Merck here &gt;&gt;&gt;)Shares of Thermo Fisher Scientific have outperformed the Zacks Medical - Instruments industry over the past year (+2.7% vs. -12.0%). The company’s robust year-over-year revenue growth in the Analytical Instruments and the Laboratory Products and Biopharma Services segments appears promising.Thermo Fisher’s accelerated investments to expand bioproduction capacity also buoy optimism. In the quarter, Thermo Fisher witnessed strength in three out of its four end markets. The upbeat guidance for 2022 is indicative that this growth momentum will continue.However, the year-over-year decline in revenues in the Life Science Solutions and Specialty Diagnostics segment is disappointing. The contraction of both margins on escalating costs and expenses does not bode well either. The year-over-year decline in adjusted earnings is concerning.(You can read the full research report on Thermo Fisher Scientific here &gt;&gt;&gt;)Shares of American Express have declined -8.6% over the past year against the Zacks Financial - Miscellaneous Services industry’s decline of -17.7%. Due to higher utilization of the company’s cards, expense in the form of card member services and card member rewards is likely to go up and strain the company's margins. Also, marketing and business development expenses are expected to rise, hurting the bottom line. As such, the stock warrants a cautious stance.Nevertheless, American Express have adopted several growth initiatives, such as launching new products, enhancing existing features, reaching new agreements and forging alliances, are boosting its revenues. Consumer spending on travel and entertainment, which carry higher margins for AmEx, is advancing well.The company’s balance sheet looks strong with manageable debt. Solid cash-generation abilities enable the pursuit of business investments and capital deployment via share buybacks and dividends.(You can read the full research report on American Express here &gt;&gt;&gt;)Other noteworthy reports we are featuring today Valero Energy Corp.

For more stocks, head on over to Mario Gabelli Stock Picks for 2023: Top 5.GAMCO Investors, Inc. is an American hedge fund that is headquartered in Rye, New York. It is one of the largest investment institutions in the world, with a total of $9.2 billion of stock market investments as of the fourth quarter of last year (for the biggest hedge funds in the world, head on over to 15 Biggest Hedge Funds in the World by AUM). The fund is managed by Mr. Mario J. Gabelli, who is its chief executive officer. Mr. Gabelli set up GAMCO, previously known as Gabelli Asset Management Company, in 1976, and has been running it since then, giving him decades of experience in the finance industry.2022 has been a year of significant economic turmoil, and as we enter 2023, institutions and investors all over are sharing their thoughts on what to expect. For instance, investment bank The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. (NYSE:GS) is one of the more optimistic analysts right now, as it believes that the ever dreaded recession that is being speculated since the mid of last year might be avoided. Mr. Gabelli also has a take on the current situation, and in an interview with CNBC he mirrored sentiments that while the first half of this year will be turbulent, investors can expect the market to take off in 2024. His research comes from the proverbial horse's mouth, as the investor outlined:""A year from now, Joe [laughs], it's gonna be 2024 and the opportunities a year later are gonna be terrific. But short term, what I'm learning from visiting companies, listening to meetings, reading the dynamics, one, goods are becoming more available, but more importantly, the managements have learned how to deal with pass throughs, how to deal with inflation, how to deal with currency, how to deal with the balance sheet and interest rates. And they're learning the inelastic questions about the demand for their products. Now from my point of view revenue's gonna be quite okay this year in nominal terms. Gross margins are going to be challenged short term for the manufacturing sector. SG&amp;A, kind of held in check, and then the question is taxes, we talked about, there's a 15% tax on booked profits, that's kinda gotta be worked out. Bottom line, I think that things are okay, but there's going to be a lot of tension in the first half of the year in the markets.""Story continuesNaturally, his insight merits a deeper look at GAMCO Investors' latest investments, out of which the top three are Herc Holdings Inc.

MLM reported mixed results for fourth-quarter 2022. Earnings beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate but revenues (products and services) missed the same. On a year-over-year basis, the metrics declined due to inclement weather in a number of key markets and higher operating costs.Pertaining to 2022 results, Ward Nye, chairman and CEO of MLM, stated, “2022 marked our Company’s eleventh consecutive year delivering increased products and services revenues, gross profit and Adjusted EBITDA, as well as our most profitable year ever. We achieved record financial results and world-class safety incidence rates while also seamlessly integrating a large platform acquisition and completing non-core asset divestitures against a backdrop of rapid monetary tightening, a resulting housing slowdown, and cost inflation at 40-year highs.”Nye added, “Entering 2023, near-term product demand visibility is supported by healthy customer backlogs driven by an acceleration in public infrastructure investment and announced large-scale energy and domestic manufacturing projects.”He further stated, “In total, we expect full year 2023 aggregates shipments to be relatively flat but, given the carryover effects of our 2022 commercial actions and broad acceptance of our January 1, 2023 price increases, we are confident in our ability to continue to deliver accelerated margin expansion.”Martin Marietta Materials, Inc.

This compares to earnings of $3.15 per share a year ago. These figures are adjusted for non-recurring items.This quarterly report represents an earnings surprise of 0.33%. A quarter ago, it was expected that this seller of granite, limestone, sand and gravel would post earnings of $4.74 per share when it actually produced earnings of $4.69, delivering a surprise of -1.05%.Over the last four quarters, the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates two times.Martin Marietta , which belongs to the Zacks Building Products - Concrete and Aggregates industry, posted revenues of $1.38 billion for the quarter ended December 2022, missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 3.72%. This compares to year-ago revenues of $1.4 billion. The company has topped consensus revenue estimates three times over the last four quarters.The sustainability of the stock's immediate price movement based on the recently-released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's commentary on the earnings call.Martin Marietta shares have added about 5.4% since the beginning of the year versus the S&amp;P 500's gain of 7.7%.What's Next for Martin Marietta?While Martin Marietta has underperformed the market so far this year, the question that comes to investors' minds is: what's next for the stock?There are no easy answers to this key question, but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company's earnings outlook. Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter(s), but also how these expectations have changed lately.Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near-term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions. Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried-and-tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank, which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions.Story continuesAhead of this earnings release, the estimate revisions trend for Martin Marietta: unfavorable. While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company's just-released earnings report, the current status translates into a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) for the stock. So, the shares are expected to underperform the market in the near future.

While this widely-known consensus outlook is important in gauging the company's earnings picture, a powerful factor that could impact its near-term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates.The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report, which is expected to be released on February 22. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call, it's worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise.Zacks Consensus EstimateThis data storage company is expected to post quarterly earnings of $1.31 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of -9%.Revenues are expected to be $1.62 billion, up 0.1% from the year-ago quarter.Estimate Revisions TrendThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 0.08% higher over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change.Earnings WhisperEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. Our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) -- has this insight at its core.The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Story continuesThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for NetApp?For NetApp, the Most Accurate Estimate is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bullish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of +0.82%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #3.So, this combination indicates that NetApp will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate.Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that NetApp would post earnings of $1.34 per share when it actually produced earnings of $1.48, delivering a surprise of +10.45%.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times.Bottom LineAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.NetApp appears a compelling earnings-beat candidate.

RMD is gaining from increased demand for its sleep and respiratory care devices. The company posted better-than-expected results for the second quarter of fiscal 2023. The robust sales performance in the Software as a Service (SaaS) segment is impressive. However, mounting operating costs and stiff competition raise apprehensions.In the past year, the Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock has lost 10% compared with a 37.9% fall of the industry and a 9.2% decline of the S&amp;P 500.The renowned medical device company has a market capitalization of $31.62 billion. Its earnings for the second quarter of fiscal 2023 surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 3.8%. The company has a long-term expected growth rate of 16.6% compared with the industry’s 13.5% rise.Let’s delve deeper.Factors At PlayQ2 Upsides: ResMed exited the second quarter of fiscal 2023 with better-than-expected earnings and revenues. The company recorded a robust sales performance in the quarter on increased demand for sleep and respiratory care devices. Mask sales growth was strong across the globe, reflecting a post-COVID pandemic awareness about the importance and need for respiratory hygiene and respiratory health. The company registered strong customer uptake of the re-engineered AirSense 10 Card-to-Cloud device.Robust Mask Sales: ResMed continues to see robust demand for a market-leading mask portfolio despite being faced with challenges related to lower new patient setups from a competitor recall. The company recorded increased masks and other sales in the United States, Canada and Latin America region in the fiscal second quarter, where growth was 11% on a reported basis, reflecting solid resupply revenues amid a challenging device-supply environment. Masks and other sales in Europe, Asia and other markets increased by 14% in constant currency terms.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchCOVID-19-Led Critical Care Drives Demand for Products: ResMed’s business received a significant boost amid the pandemic on the back of strong demand for critical care products like ventilators and masks.Story continuesDuring the fiscal second-quarter update, the company continues to drive growth, banking on the strong adoption of ventilator devices worldwide. The company witnessed good uptake of both the life support and non-life support ventilator platforms during the quarter. There is also ongoing adoption of Propeller's monitoring system. Its digital therapeutic platform is now integrated with the two leading US electronic health record systems Epic and Cerner. This digital health integration makes it easier for doctors and healthcare workers to onboard people to the Propeller platform.DownsidesMounting Costs: During the quarter, ResMed’s selling, general and administrative expenses rose 14.2% year over year, predominantly on increases in employee-related expenses, professional service fees and travel expenses. Meanwhile, research and development expenses increased 11.8%. These mounting expenses led to an adjusted operating margin contraction of 36 bps year over year to 29.6%, weighing on the company’s bottom line.Competitive Landscape: The market for SDB products is highly competitive with respect to product price, features and reliability. ResMed's primary competitors include Philips BV; DeVilbiss Healthcare; Fisher &amp; Paykel Healthcare Corporation Limited; Apex Medical Corporation; BMC Medical Co. Ltd.; and regional manufacturers. The disparity between the company's resources and those of its competitors may increase due to consolidation in the healthcare industry. Moreover, some of ResMed's competitors, such as Löwenstein Medical GmbH + Co. KG, are affiliates of its customers, which may make it difficult for the company to compete with them.Estimate TrendOver the past 90 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for ResMed’s fiscal 2023 earnings has moved down to $6.38 by 1.5%.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for its fiscal 2023 revenues is pegged at $4.08 billion, suggesting a 14% rise from the 2022 comparable figure.Key PicksSome better-ranked stocks in the broader medical space are AMN Healthcare Services, Inc.

However, the metric fell from $1.17 reported in the year-ago quarter.

The branded convenience food products provider’s solid brand portfolio has been a major driver. Management is on track with its cost-saving efforts to counter the rising inflationary environment.The upsides mentioned above drove CPB’s first-quarter fiscal 2023 results, with net sales and earnings rising year over year and beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate. Management expects 7-9% net sales growth, with 7-9% organic sales growth during fiscal 2023. Adjusted earnings per share (EPS) is envisioned to be up 2-5% to come in at $2.90-$3.00 during this time.Let’s discuss the factors driving Campbell Soup’s performance.Snacks Business SolidZacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchThe Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) company is benefiting from its growing Snacks business. The segment contributed 43.5% to the company’s top line in the first quarter of fiscal 2023. Net sales in the division rose 15% (also organically) to $1,120 million. The upside can be attributed to sales of power brands which rose 21%. Sales growth was fueled by a rise in cookies and crackers, specifically Goldfish crackers and in salty snacks, Snyder's of Hanover pretzels and Kettle Brand and CapeCod potato chips. Inflation-driven pricing and sales allowances were somewhat offset by soft volume and higher promotional spending.Campbell Soup’s Snacks unit has been standing out for a while now. This business is likely to tap incremental sales, backed by a proven growth model with strength in the power snacks brands and higher innovation.Savings Plan on TrackCampbell Soup has been progressing well with its cost-saving plan. The company’s strategy of concentrating on supply-chain efficiencies, curtailing costs and reinvesting part of these savings in high-growth potential areas is noteworthy. In the first quarter of fiscal 2023, the company generated $10 million in savings under its multi-year cost-saving program, including Snyder’s-Lance synergies, bringing total program-to-date cost savings to $860 million. Management is on track to deliver savings worth $1 billion by fiscal 2025-end.Story continuesWrapping UpCampbell Soup has been struggling with cost inflation for a while. In the first quarter of fiscal 2023, its adjusted gross profit margin contracted 30 basis points to 32.2% due to continued cost inflation, increased other supply chain costs and unfavorable volume/ mixManagement expects to keep witnessing cost inflation throughout fiscal 2023.

347,00914da3-847b-384a-85ff-f3416e2ab020,OXY,2023-02-16,3 Top Energy Stocks With Impressive Upside Potential in 2023,InvestorPlace,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/3-top-energy-stocks-impressive-011048019.html,1676250648,STORY,"['XOM', 'OXY', 'MRO']","[Investors assessing how various sectors will perform in 2023 certainly have their hands full. There are plenty of uncertainties to consider, from central bank-related macro concerns to geopolitical issues and a slowing global economy. What this portends for energy stocks in particular is going to be difficult to ascertain.That said, I think there’s good reason for investors to consider adding some exposure to energy stocks right now. This is a sector that’s given back much of its gains from last year. However, many of the same catalysts that drove energy stocks higher remain in play.Thus, for those looking to hedge against market uncertainty this year, the three energy stocks below are among the best in the sector with regard to fundamental strength, industry outlook and financial position.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsMROMarathon Oil$27.75OXYOccidental Petroleum$65.63XOMExxon Mobil$119.17Marathon Oil (MRO)Marathon Oil Logo at the top of a mobile device.Source: IgorGolovniov / Shutterstock.comMarathon Oil (NYSE:MRO) is one of North America’s leading oil and gas exploration and production companies. Its oil and gas portfolio is well-positioned to benefit from the anticipated improvement in market conditions in 2023.This is one of the energy stocks I’ve had my eye on for some time as a high-growth play. MRO is off to a slow start in 2023, up just 2.5%. And that includes Friday’s 6.2% pop as oil prices jumped on news Russia plans to cut its oil output by 500,000 barrels a day next month. However, the stock delivered a 67% gain in 2022.Marathon is scheduled to report fourth-quarter and full-year earnings on Feb. 15. Analysts are calling for EPS of 85 cents, a 10.4% increase over the year-ago quarter. However, I think the company could exceed analysts’ earnings expectations, as it has done in each of the past four quarters. If it does, the stock could see bullish momentum pick up.For the full year, analysts are forecasting a 44% jump in revenue and for earnings to nearly triple to $4.57 per share. Revenue is expected to decline in 2023, though only by 0.5%, while earnings are estimated to contract by 18.6%.Story continuesHowever, the company recently disclosed that it had successfully completed the acquisition of Ensign Natural Resources’ Eagle Ford assets for a total cash consideration of $3 billion. This is a key driver of bottom-line growth I think the market has yet to price in.Occidental Petroleum (OXY)Person holding cellphone with logo of American company Occidental Petroleum Corp. (OXY) on screen in front of website. Focus on phone display. Unmodified photo.Source: T. Schneider / Shutterstock.comOccidental Petroleum (NYSE:OXY) is another major player in the oil and gas production and exploration space and a favorite of Warren Buffett.The stock is up 4.2% so far this year, less than the 6.5% gain in the S&amp;P 500. But shares surged 119% in 2022, no doubt helped by the clout of the world’s best-known investor throwing his weight behind the company. In July, Berkshire gained the approval of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to buy up to 50% of the oil company’s common stock. Currently, Berkshire owns more than 194 million OXY shares for a 21.4% stake worth approximately $12.8 billion.Occidental is expected to report fourth-quarter and full-year results at the end of the month. For 2022, analysts are predicting revenue will increase by 41% to $37.2 billion. Earnings per share are estimated to surge 280% to $9.69. As these forecasts show, the company benefited greatly from last year’s elevated energy prices. And while analysts are predicting revenue and earnings will decline this year, Occidental is still expected to earn $6.84 a share on $33.3 billion in revenue.Analysts’ average 12-month target price of $75.36 is 15% above where shares currently trade. That’s not as impressive as the 53% return over the past 12 months. However, with Buffett in the company’s corner, more upside may be in the cards.Exxon Mobil (XOM)XOM Stock Is on the Way Back, but It Will Take Some TimeSource: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.comShares of Houston-based Exxon Mobil (NYSE:XOM) are up 8% so far in 2023, marking the best year-to-date performance among today’s top energy stocks.  Over the past year, XOM has gained 53%.In addition to producing, transporting and selling petroleum products, Exxon is involved in manufacturing synthetic rubber, plastics and other items that will remain in high demand regardless of short-term oil price fluctuations. Moreover, its control over the entire value chain enables Exxon to retain a larger share of the profits it generates than many of its competitors.On Jan. 31, the company reported a record $56 billion in net profits for 2022. As news organizations were quick to point out, that translates to $6.3 million an hour, or more than $100,000 a minute.While revenue and earnings are projected to decline this year on lower oil prices,  I think the company will continue to deliver for investors due to its vertically integrated business model and the recent progress with the $8 billion Coral South floating liquified natural gas project in Mozambique. Exxon said the project produced its first LNG cargo in November. While XOM may not deliver gains as large as the other energy stocks on this list, it is an excellent option for long-term investors. In addition to producing long-term capital gains, the company pays an attractive dividend for a 3.1% yield. Exxon has raised that dividend in each of the past 40 years.On the date of publication, Chris MacDonald did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.Chris MacDonald’s love for investing led him to pursue an MBA in Finance and take on a number of management roles in corporate finance and venture capital over the past 15 years.

And out of all of the metrics and results to consider, earnings is one of the most important.We know earnings results are vital, but how a company performs compared to bottom line expectations can be even more important when it comes to stock prices, especially in the near-term. This means that investors might want to take advantage of these earnings surprises.2 Stocks to Add to Your WatchlistThe Zacks Earnings ESP is more formally known as the Expected Surprise Prediction, and it aims to grab the inside track on the latest analyst estimate revisions ahead of a company's report. The idea is relatively intuitive as a newer projection might be based on more complete information. The ESP is calculated by comparing the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate, with the percentage difference between the two giving us the Zacks ESP figure.The last thing we will do today, now that we have a grasp on the ESP and how powerful of a tool it can be, is to look at a qualifying stock. Ulta Beauty (ULTA) holds a Zacks Rank #2 at the moment and its Most Accurate Estimate comes in at $6 a share 22 days away from its upcoming earnings release on March 9, 2023.Ulta Beauty's Earnings ESP sits at 8.53%, which, as explained above, is calculated by taking the percentage difference between the $6 Most Accurate Estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $5.53.ULTA is part of a big group of Retail-Wholesale stocks that boast a positive ESP, and investors may want to take a look at Dick's Sporting Goods (DKS) as well.Dick's Sporting Goods is a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock, and is getting ready to report earnings on March 7, 2023. DKS' Most Accurate Estimate sits at $3.09 a share 20 days from its next earnings release.Dick's Sporting Goods' Earnings ESP figure currently stands at 7.97% after taking the percentage difference between its Most Accurate Estimate and its Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.86.Story continuesBecause both stocks hold a positive Earnings ESP, ULTA and DKS could potentially post earnings beats in their next reports.Find Stocks to Buy or Sell Before They're ReportedUse the Zacks Earnings ESP Filter to turn up stocks with the highest probability of positively, or negatively, surprising to buy or sell before they're reported for profitable earnings season trading.

In Q4 2022, Warren Buffett significantly reduced his investment in Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (NYSE:TSM) only a few months after disclosing a substantial stake. This rapid turnaround by the famous stock picker has spooked investors, and sentiment towards the chip giant has dampened as a result. Berkshire Hathaway reduced its ownership of Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (NYSE:TSM)'s American depositary receipts by 86% in the fourth quarter, according to the latest filings. If Berkshire sold the shares at the average price during that time, the sale of the stake would have raked in $3.7 billion. In the wake of this announcement, the stock prices of the world's largest chip manufacturer declined by up to 4% in Taipei, contributing to widespread losses in the market.Tony Huang, vice president at Taishin Securities Investment Advisory Co, told Bloomberg on February 15: “It’s surprising that Berkshire cut its holding so much in just a quarter, which differs from its past practice of long-term investment and continuing to add shares.”While Berkshire Hathaway opted to sell its holdings in Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (NYSE:TSM), it added 333,856 shares to its position in Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL). For Q4 2022, Apple reported its worst revenue results for a holiday season in seven years.Some of the best long-term stocks to buy according to Warren Buffett include The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO), American Express Company (NYSE:AXP), and Bank of America Corporation (NYSE:BAC). Our MethodologyWe selected the stocks from the Q4 portfolio of Berkshire which have been part of the fund's portfolio for at least 5 years.

Offsetting this increased tech weight was a 3-percentage point decrease in industrials and a two-percentage point decline in health care. The other two largest purchases include Visa Inc. (NYSE:V) and Abbott Labs which likewise saw their valuations improve as their estimated free cash flows held up or improved while their enterprise values declined.”8. VeriSign, Inc.

DaVita Inc. (NYSE:DVA)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 30Berkshire’s Holding Period: 11 YearsBerkshire’s Stake Value: $2,695,256,212DaVita Inc. (NYSE:DVA) is a Colorado-based company that provides kidney dialysis services for patients suffering from chronic kidney failure. In Q4 2022, Buffett owned 36 million shares of DaVita Inc. (NYSE:DVA) worth $2.7 billion, representing 0.90% of the total 13F securities. It is one of the long-term stock picks of Buffett, featuring on the Berkshire portfolio for 11 years. On November 1, Pito Chickering, an analyst at Deutsche Bank, lowered DaVita Inc. (NYSE:DVA)’s rating from Buy to Hold and set a new price target of $72, down from $97, following the release of its Q3 results. The analyst informed investors that healthcare service providers have been affected by inflationary pressures in 2022, and DaVita has managed these challenges exceptionally well. However, he attributes the downgrade to the issue of patients missing appointments at dialysis clinics in Q3 and the company's guidance on this matter.According to Insider Monkey’s data, 30 hedge funds were bullish on DaVita Inc. (NYSE:DVA) at the end of Q3 2022, compared to 28 funds in the last quarter. Jeffrey Gates’ Gates Capital Management held a prominent stake in the company, consisting of 1.46 million shares worth $121.20 million. Moon Capital made the following comment about DaVita Inc. (NYSE:DVA) in its Q4 2022 investor letter:“During the fourth quarter, we purchased shares in DaVita Inc. (NYSE:DVA), a dialysis center operator. For those unfamiliar, kidney dialysis involves the critical removal of toxins, fluids and salts from the blood by artificial means. Roughly 500,000 patients receive kidney dialysis in the U.S., which requires a 3.5-hour treatment three times a week. The only alternatives to the treatments are a kidney transplant or potential fatality. Given the critical nature of its services, demand has little correlation with the overall economy, resulting in a highly recession resistant business.The U.S. dialysis industry is highly concentrated, with two companies (DaVita and its competitor Fresenius) controlling a combined 80% of the $25 billion market. The dominance of this duopoly provides massive scale advantages, making it incredibly difficult for new entrants to gain profitable market share.In the past, DaVita’s valuation has been penalized (we view unfairly) because the company generates a significant portion of its operating income from a small percentage of its patients. Of DaVita’s 200,000 patients, approximately 90% qualify for Medicare (or Medicaid), with the remaining 10% covered by a commercial insurance provider. While commercial insurers pay an average of $1,000 per treatment, the federal government’s pay rate for Medicare and Medicaid is only $275 – which is actually less than what it costs DVA to provide the treatment…”(Click here to read the full text)6. Moody's Corporation (NYSE:MCO)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 63Berkshire’s Holding Period: 12 YearsBerkshire’s Stake Value: $6,873,493,546Moody's Corporation (NYSE:MCO) is a New York-based integrated risk assessment firm that publishes credit ratings and provides assessment services on various debt obligations, programs and facilities, and entities that issue such obligations. Moody's Corporation (NYSE:MCO) has been in the Berkshire portfolio for 12 years. Buffett owns a $6.8 billion position in the company. On January 31, Moody's Corporation (NYSE:MCO) reported a Q4 non-GAAP EPS of $1.60, beating market estimates by $0.13. The revenue of $1.29 billion outperformed Wall Street consensus by $20 million. For FY2023, the company expects revenue to increase in the mid-to-high single digit percent range and adjusted diluted EPS of $9 to $9.50, versus a consensus of $9.28.Ashish Sabadra, an analyst from RBC Capital, increased the target price for Moody's Corporation (NYSE:MCO) on February 1 from $329 to $350 and maintained an Outperform rating on the company's shares after it exceeded Q4 earnings expectations. In a research note to investors, the analyst said that the company's FY23 guidance may be too cautious because of the anticipated strong recovery in issuance. Additionally, RBC Capital thinks that Moody's projected buyback guidance for 2023 is conservative and will result in only about half of its free cash flows being returned to shareholders.According to Insider Monkey’s third quarter database, 63 hedge funds were long Moody's Corporation (NYSE:MCO), compared to 48 funds in the preceding quarter. Chris Hohn’s TCI Fund Management is a significant position holder in the company, with 8.2 million shares worth $2 billion. In addition to The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO), American Express Company (NYSE:AXP), and Bank of America Corporation (NYSE:BAC), Moody's Corporation (NYSE:MCO) has featured on the Berkshire portfolio for several years.  Here is what Qualivian Investment Partners has to say about Moody’s Corporation (NYSE:MCO) in its Q2 2021 investor letter:“Moody’s: Revenue, operating profit margins, and EPS all exceeded expectations, and annual guidance for these items (and for free cash flow) was raised. In MIS (Moody’s Investors Service) which houses the traditional ratings business, the outlook for debt issuance was raised for the remainder of the year, while MA (Moody’s Analytics) also came in ahead of expectations. The company leveraged strong revenue growth with strong operating profit margin improvement of 200 bps, with EPS coming in $0.22 ahead of consensus estimates. Management alluded to having interesting opportunities in their M&amp;A pipeline, which we will have to assess when the time comes, but Moody’s management team has been very effective at allocating capital in the past toward value-creating bolt-on acquisitions, especially in their Moody’s Analytics business, a key growth driver for the company.” Click to continue reading and see 5 Best Long-Term Stocks To Buy According To Warren Buffett.  Suggested articles:13 Stocks Big Short Michael Burry is Buying and Selling10 Jim Cramer Stocks This Month10 Tech Stocks To Sell Now According to Cathie Wood Disclosure: None. 10 Best Long-Term Stocks To Buy According To Warren Buffett is originally published on Insider Monkey.]"

You can skip our detailed analysis of the early retirement phenomenon and dividend stocks, and go directly to read Early Retirement Portfolio: 5 Stocks to Live Off Dividends. Due to the onset of the pandemic in 2020, early retirement gained a steady pace among Americans. According to a report by New York Times, millennial workers plan to retire in their 50s to pursue their interests. However, their financial condition suggests otherwise. The report showed results from the Global Benefits Attitudes Survey, revealing that 36% of millennial workers were just saving around 5% of their income, which is not sufficient to cover living expenses post-retirement.The financial instability, coupled with growing inflation, has somewhat altered investor sentiment who are now delaying their retirement plans. According to a survey conducted by the Nationwide Retirement Institute, 40% of US workers ages 45 years or above are holding up on their retirement, which is twice the number of workers who asserted the same last year. The survey also mentioned that only 58% of the workers are positive about their retirement plans, down from 74% in 2021. This was also supported by data from Natixis Investment Managers, which highlighted that 58% of high-net-worth individuals plan to work beyond their retirement age due to market uncertainty.As major stocks and bonds fell in 2022, retiree investors are turning to stocks that offer long-term growth and can generate stable income. Over the years, dividend stocks have shown promising performance, becoming investors’ top choices in times of financial instability. Moreover, companies with long dividend growth streaks and positive cash flow generation are also great investment options for retirees. Among these companies are PepsiCo, Inc. (NASDAQ:PEP), AbbVie Inc. (NYSE:ABBV), and Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) who have raised their dividends for decades, even during market turmoil. Readers can also have a look at 30 Best Stocks for Retirement, which discusses dividends retirement stocks in detail.Story continuesLast year, I wrote an article on Early Retirement Portfolio: 15 Stocks to Live Off Dividends, which listed dividend companies derived from different user platforms. With soaring inflation and risks of recession, it was time to update that list and focus on stocks that offer passive income opportunities to retiree investors. This list includes stocks that have impressive track records of making regular dividend payments and have raised their payouts for at least 10 years. For this reason, some of the stocks from the previous list were replaced by those that regularly increase their payouts. Costco Wholesale Corporation (NASDAQ:COST), Raytheon Technologies Corporation (NYSE:RTX), Kellogg Company (NYSE:K), Eastman Chemical Company (NYSE:EMN), Realty Income Corporation (NYSE:O), Walgreens Boots Alliance, Inc.

Here is what the firm has to say:“Let’s look at The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG). Dividend yield is 2.4%. Earnings are forecasted to grow at 5.9%, and its current earnings multiple is at 25x. Now, lets say over the next 3-5 years the market loses interest in the “safe”, mature companies that grow at anemic rates and gets an appetite for growth again. It’s very unlikely that Mr. Market will be paying 25x for 5.9% earnings growth. Lets assume that multiple declines to the market average of 18x — that would be ~6.9% drag per year on the total expected return over next 3-5 years. If we get 2.4% (dividend) + 5.9% (earnings growth) – 6.9% (decrease in earnings multiple) = 1.4% (annual return we can expect on average from this stock).”11. The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO)Dividend Yield as of February 14: 2.90%The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) has kept its dividends steady during previous inflationary periods.

Here is what the firm has to say:“Let’s take The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) for example. Its dividend yield is 2.8%, earnings are estimated to grow at only 3.6% rate per year over next 4 years, and its earnings multiple is currently at 24x (based on next years forecasted earnings). KO has an anemic growth, so we can argue that paying 24x earnings is not very attractive. Let’s assume that the multiple will stay constant over the next 3-5 years, thus our expected annual returns will be 2.8%+3.6% = 6.4% (that is below the current reported inflation rate and only slightly above the risk-free rate of 4%).”10.

Drugs like Keytruda and Gardasil (HPV vaccine) have been driving sales. With continued label expansion into new indications &amp; early-stage settings, Keytruda is expected to remain a key top-line driver.Animal health and vaccine products are core growth drivers. Its new COVID oral antiviral pill, Lagevrio, has become a key top-line driver in 2022. Merck boasts a strong cancer pipeline, including Keytruda, which should help drive long-term growth.However, generic competition for several drugs and rising competitive pressure, mainly on the diabetes franchise, will continue to be overhangs on the top line. There are concerns about Merck’s ability to grow its non-oncology business ahead of Keytruda’s loss of exclusivity later in the decade.(You can read the full research report on Merck here &gt;&gt;&gt;)Shares of Thermo Fisher Scientific have outperformed the Zacks Medical - Instruments industry over the past year (+2.7% vs. -12.0%). The company’s robust year-over-year revenue growth in the Analytical Instruments and the Laboratory Products and Biopharma Services segments appears promising.Thermo Fisher’s accelerated investments to expand bioproduction capacity also buoy optimism. In the quarter, Thermo Fisher witnessed strength in three out of its four end markets. The upbeat guidance for 2022 is indicative that this growth momentum will continue.However, the year-over-year decline in revenues in the Life Science Solutions and Specialty Diagnostics segment is disappointing. The contraction of both margins on escalating costs and expenses does not bode well either. The year-over-year decline in adjusted earnings is concerning.(You can read the full research report on Thermo Fisher Scientific here &gt;&gt;&gt;)Shares of American Express have declined -8.6% over the past year against the Zacks Financial - Miscellaneous Services industry’s decline of -17.7%. Due to higher utilization of the company’s cards, expense in the form of card member services and card member rewards is likely to go up and strain the company's margins. Also, marketing and business development expenses are expected to rise, hurting the bottom line. As such, the stock warrants a cautious stance.Nevertheless, American Express have adopted several growth initiatives, such as launching new products, enhancing existing features, reaching new agreements and forging alliances, are boosting its revenues. Consumer spending on travel and entertainment, which carry higher margins for AmEx, is advancing well.The company’s balance sheet looks strong with manageable debt.

365,7370ed11-ed68-3fd6-8e4b-02751f853ad6,INTU,2023-02-16,10 Profitable SaaS Companies for 2023,Insider Monkey,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/10-profitable-saas-companies-2023-224937964.html,1676501377,STORY,"['NOW', 'ADBE', 'BOX', 'DBX', 'VEEV', 'INTU', 'AKAM', 'FFIV']","[In this piece, we will take a look at the ten most profitable SaaS companies for 2023. For more companies, head on over to 5 Most Profitable SaaS Companies for 2023. The growth in computing power over the past couple of decades has revolutionized the matter in which both companies and individuals live their lives and run their businesses. While computers of the past were limited to large facilities where researchers or others had to physically relocate themselves, nowadays, vast amounts of computing power are available right in the palm of a hand.As an example, the Apple A15 Bionic chip that is used in the latest iPhone models has a whopping 15 billion transistors on a die area of 107 mm², while one of the first processors, Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC)'s Intel 4004 had a mere 2,300 transistors with a die size of 12 mm². In terms of computing power, this has increased beyond comprehension, since while the 4004 was able to compute a respectable 92,000 instructions per second, the A15's Neural Engine goes as high as being able to crunch 15.8 trillion operations per second.This growth in computing has created new industries of its own, one of which is the Software as a Service (SaaS) sector. Broadly speaking, SaaS covers all firms that host software on their own hardware and then provide a subscription based service to customers willing to use the products. This has a variety of benefits for the customer, as it saves the costs of setting up expensive hardware and generates flexibility in usage since anyone with an Internet connection can use the service. Yet, this flexibility also comes with some drawbacks such as the lack of control over how the service operates and privacy concerns as data is stored in an external server.These compelling benefits have also led to sterling valuations for the SaaS sector. For instance, a research report from Industry Research released in November 2022, believes that the industry was worth $96 billion in 2022 and will grow at a compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) of 15.9% and be worth an estimated $235 billion by the end of 2028. While this might sound a bit less when comes to the technology industry, it is important to keep in mind that the SaaS industry is primarily a software arena that does not have any major and expensive hardware products to drive up its value. The research firm segments the market along several different areas such as public, private, and hybrid clouds alongside pureplay SaaS products. It also lists the major applications that SaaS covers, with some of these being customer relationship management (CRM), supply chain management (SCM), and enterprise resource planning (ERP).Story continuesAnother report, this time from SkyQuest Technology Consulting, has even stronger hopes for the sector. It outlines that the SaaS industry was worth $147 billion in 2021 and will grow at a CAGR of 25.8% between 2022 and 2028 to be worth a whopping $720 billion by the end of the forecast period. The firm believes that the onset of the coronavirus pandemic stimulated the industry as it made firms increase the rate at which they digitized their operations and shares that globally, the growth in the use of computers, cell phones, and other technology products is driving the industry's growth.Focusing on the current state of the industry, one SaaS platform that you should have come across by now is ChatGPT. The conversation chatbox that took the Internet by storm has several characteristics which make it the perfect SaaS application. ChatGPT is hosted on a central server and users create an account to access it and use its services over the Internet - in an atypical definition of how SaaS works. In fact, the amalgamation of artificial intelligence into SaaS is a hot topic these days in the industry, particularly due to the lucrative nature of the industry itself. The standalone AI industry, according to Grand View Market Research, can be worth as much as $1.8 trillion by 2030, and some of the ways in which it is making its way into the SaaS sector are improving customer experience through personalization, speeding up processes, improving threat detection, and generating new insights through identifying trends.These factors, combined with the fact that global cloud spending slowed down to 30% for the first time in history last year due to high inflation merits a look at the SaaS industry to sift out which companies are actually making shareholders money in terms of earnings per share. Some of the top performers are Adobe Inc. (NASDAQ:ADBE), Intuit Inc. (NASDAQ:INTU), and Box, Inc. (NYSE:BOX).10 Profitable SaaS Companies for 2023Copyright: ralwel / 123RF Stock PhotoOur Methodology We took a broad look at the technology industry to sift out which companies provide SaaS products and services to their customers and earn most of their revenue from it.

Intuit (INTU), which belongs to the Zacks Computer - Software industry, could be a great candidate to consider.This maker of TurboTax, QuickBooks and other accounting software has seen a nice streak of beating earnings estimates, especially when looking at the previous two reports. The average surprise for the last two quarters was 25.87%.For the last reported quarter, Intuit came out with earnings of $1.66 per share versus the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.19 per share, representing a surprise of 39.50%. For the previous quarter, the company was expected to post earnings of $0.98 per share and it actually produced earnings of $1.10 per share, delivering a surprise of 12.24%.Price and EPS SurpriseFor Intuit, estimates have been trending higher, thanks in part to this earnings surprise history. And when you look at the stock's positive Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction), it's a great indicator of a future earnings beat, especially when combined with its solid Zacks Rank.Our research shows that stocks with the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time. In other words, if you have 10 stocks with this combination, the number of stocks that beat the consensus estimate could be as high as seven.The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is related to change. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Intuit has an Earnings ESP of +0.42% at the moment, suggesting that analysts have grown bullish on its near-term earnings potential. When you combine this positive Earnings ESP with the stock's Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), it shows that another beat is possibly around the corner. The company's next earnings report is expected to be released on February 23, 2023.Story continuesInvestors should note, however, that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss, but a negative value does reduce the predictive power of this metric.Many companies end up beating the consensus EPS estimate, though this is not the only reason why their shares gain. Additionally, some stocks may remain stable even if they end up missing the consensus estimate.Because of this, it's really important to check a company's Earnings ESP ahead of its quarterly release to increase the odds of success.

368,5c718e25-9d84-3a2d-ab72-bce8958475c8,INTU,2023-02-16,7 Long-Term Stocks to Buy With Your Tax Refund,InvestorPlace,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/7-long-term-stocks-buy-192127600.html,1676229687,STORY,"['INTU', 'IBM', 'XOM', 'CMPS', 'KELYB', 'CWCO']","[While going on a spending spree with your tax refund might seem tempting, a better approach with your windfall may be to invest in long-term stocks to buy. For one thing, that refund isn’t really that. Instead, it’s the amount you overpaid in taxes. Thus, it amounts to an interest-free loan that you gave Uncle Sam so don’t get too happy about it.Second, the average tax “refund” amounted to $3,176 in 2022. While many families could see smaller checks this year, we’re still talking a big chunk of cash. Naturally, you don’t want to blow it all on frivolous purchases that you’ll regret later. Rather, it’s better to consider an accretive approach, particularly long-term stocks to buy that can give you back your refund and then some.Finally, if buy something stupid with your refund, the money and any associated benefits evaporate. On the other hand, if certain long-term stocks to buy don’t work out, you may use the losses to your advantage, so as to offset capital gains. With that in mind, below are some enticing market ideas to consider.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsIBMIBM.$135.60XOMExxon Mobil$119.17INTUIntuit$413.52CWCOConsolidated Water$15.12KELYAKelly Services$17.96ROVRRover$3.89CMPSCOMPASS Pathways$9.47IBM (IBM)Photo of IBM (IBM) building as seen through the canopy of a tree. IBM logo is in large letters on side of building.Source: shutterstock.com/LCVFor many years, IBM (NYSE:IBM) struggled as other technology firms stole its thunder. Dragged down by legacy businesses, “Big Blue” just couldn’t keep pace with younger, nimbler competitors. However, management got its act together and now, a “new” Blue is in town.Don’t believe me? While the tech-centric Nasdaq Composite index dropped nearly 17% of market value in the trailing year, IBM managed to poke its head just above parity. It’s not an impressive performance by itself but it’s a lot better than 17% down. Plus, unlike other tech firms that absorbed double-digit percentage losses in 2022, IBM pays a dividend.Indeed, its forward yield stands at 4.93%, which ranks well above the tech sector’s average yield of 1.37%. Additionally, the company’s payout ratio is 65.45%, which while not small still represents a manageable figure. As well, IBM commands 29 years of consecutive dividend increases, making it one of the best long-term stocks to buy. Admittedly, Wall Street’s consensus assessment for IBM is a hold. However, the average price target of $143.56 implies upside potential of over 7%.Story continuesExxon Mobil (XOM)Exxon Retail Gas LocationSource: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.comGiven all the political dynamism associated with clean energy infrastructures, Exxon Mobil (NYSE:XOM) might not seem a bright idea for long-term stocks to buy. However, as President Joe Biden stated, we’re going to need oil for the next 10 years. If the leader of the Democrats believes in big oil, perhaps you should too.Indeed, my first reaction was that we’re going to need hydrocarbons for much longer than 10 years. Sure enough, other much more esteemed individuals stated the same thing. Therefore, as intolerable as XOM might seem to some investors going all-in on green energy, it’s one of the long-term stocks to buy.If it makes anyone feel any better, while XOM wouldn’t be considered cheap, it’s fiscally robust. Right now, both its long-term revenue trend and trailing-year profitability metrics rate above sector median stats. Additionally, Exxon Mobil enjoys a strong balance sheet. Finally, Wall Street analysts peg XOM as a consensus moderate buy. Further, their average price target stands at $125.28, implying upside potential of almost 10%.Intuit (INTU)Stacks of coins hold up wooden blocks that spell out ""TAX."" FairTaxSource: ShutterstockYou just got done doing your taxes and getting your so-called refund. Why then should you invest in Intuit (NASDAQ:INTU), the popular tax and accounting software provider? Mainly, Intuit helps doing taxes a less onerous and painful process. Therefore, you can feel good knowing that your money supports a noble cause. More importantly, though, Intuit enjoys an underappreciated catalyst: the gig economy.Everyone loves talking about the gig economy because of its lucrative potential. One research firm believes it will command a valuation of $873 billion by 2028. It very well might but here’s the thing: what really distinguishes employees from independent contractors (gig workers) is the tax-filing requirements.Long story short, gig workers essentially operate as businesses; that is, people are in business for themselves. Therefore, the taxes are appropriately complex. For first time gig workers, Intuit’s tax programs may be a lifesaver. Currently, Wall Street analysts peg INTU as a consensus strong buy. Also, their average price target stands at $492.33, implying over 17% upside potential. Therefore, it’s a great idea for long-term stocks to buy.Consolidated Water (CWCO)A zoomed in photo of a drop of water hitting a container of water's surface.Source: Sambulov Yevgeniy/ShutterStock.comBy most measures, Consolidated Water (NASDAQ:CWCO) represents a boring example of long-term stocks to buy. Per its website, Consolidated is an international water solutions company, supplying potable water, treating water for reuse, and manufacturing and providing water-related products and services. To be fair, it’s boilerplate stuff.However, where Consolidated gets interesting is in desalination. On one of its webpages, the company “designs, builds, operates, and in some cases finances seawater reverse osmosis (SWRO) desalination plants and water distribution systems in several Caribbean countries, where the supply of drinking water is scarce and the use of SWRO is economically feasible.”Here’s the deal – water scarcity represents a brewing global crisis. Over the long run, desalination stands poised to deliver incredible solutions. Also, advancements in renewable energy infrastructures or even nuclear could make desalination even more feasible. Presently, one analyst covers CWCO with a buy rating and a price target implying upside of 35%. For speculators, it’s well worth consideration for long-term stocks to buy.Kelly Services (KELYA)An image of a businesswoman shaking hands with a female executive at a job interviewSource: ShutterstockOne of the discombobulating circumstances associated with the post-pandemic new normal centers on how quickly circumstances may change. Earlier, it seemed as if employers were begging for job applicants, throwing in concessions wherever possible. These days, however, mass layoffs appear to be a central theme, particularly for the tech industry.Fortunately, that’s where Kelly Services (NASDAQ:KELYA) might bring some hope to the table. As a staffing agency, its phone lines are probably busy at the moment. And they could get busier still. That’s because Kelly doesn’t just specialize in one particular niche, like finance and accounting. Rather, the company features connections with a broad range of industries.What I’m getting at is that beggars can’t be choosers. Once the bills start piling up, people may lose their pride and pick up a warehousing shift. Thus, KELYA makes for an intriguing (albeit cynical) candidate for long-term stocks to buy. Finally, covering analysts peg KELYA as a consensus moderate buy. As well, their average price target stands at $24.50, implying upside potential of over 36%.Rover (ROVR)a puppy and a kitten sniggling together. represents pet stocksSource: ShutterstockAmericans love their pets – perhaps a bit too much. Still, the numbers won’t be denied. In 2021, the American Pet Products Association revealed that total pet industry sales hit $123.6 billion. Personally, I’d bet an even stronger result for 2022. And that bodes well for Rover (NASDAQ:ROVR), a platform that connects dog owners with independent canine service providers.Now, during the worst of the coronavirus pandemic, most white-collar workers operated remotely. However, more than a few high-profile enterprises began recalling their employees. Suddenly, pet owners no longer can care for their furry friends. Therefore, to keep their four-legged family members occupied, a professional dog care specialist may be necessary. In my view, then, ROVR represents an enticing name among long-term stocks to buy.Despite its volatility risks, Wall Street analysts peg ROVR as a consensus moderate buy. Also, their average price target stands at $5.58, implying upside potential of almost 41%.COMPASS Pathways (CMPS)psychedelic stocksSource: luckakcul / Shutterstock.comIf you’re feeling that something isn’t quite right in the U.S., you’re not alone. According to a survey which CNN conducted in partnership with the Kaiser Family Foundation, an overwhelming majority of Americans believe the country is experiencing a mental health crisis. I’m not going to dive too deeply into the topic but many of the individual stories are heart wrenching.However, COMPASS Pathways (NASDAQ:CMPS) offers an innovative solution. Leveraging psilocybin therapy, Compass aims to help patients suffering from treatment-resistant depression. Of course, the company attracts some misunderstandings as psilocybin represents a naturally occurring psychedelic. Still, clinical evidence suggests that the approach carries much potential, though additional research must be undertaken.Inherently, CMPS is a high-risk, high-reward venture among long-term stocks to buy. Still, if you decide to go ahead, you’ll be glad to know that Wall Street stands behind you. Currently, CMPS carries a strong buy consensus view. As well, analysts believe shares will hit $56, implying nearly 500% upside potential.On the date of publication, Josh Enomoto did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.A former senior business analyst for Sony Electronics, Josh Enomoto has helped broker major contracts with Fortune Global 500 companies.

In Q4 2022, Warren Buffett significantly reduced his investment in Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (NYSE:TSM) only a few months after disclosing a substantial stake. This rapid turnaround by the famous stock picker has spooked investors, and sentiment towards the chip giant has dampened as a result. Berkshire Hathaway reduced its ownership of Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (NYSE:TSM)'s American depositary receipts by 86% in the fourth quarter, according to the latest filings. If Berkshire sold the shares at the average price during that time, the sale of the stake would have raked in $3.7 billion. In the wake of this announcement, the stock prices of the world's largest chip manufacturer declined by up to 4% in Taipei, contributing to widespread losses in the market.Tony Huang, vice president at Taishin Securities Investment Advisory Co, told Bloomberg on February 15: “It’s surprising that Berkshire cut its holding so much in just a quarter, which differs from its past practice of long-term investment and continuing to add shares.”While Berkshire Hathaway opted to sell its holdings in Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (NYSE:TSM), it added 333,856 shares to its position in Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL). For Q4 2022, Apple reported its worst revenue results for a holiday season in seven years.Some of the best long-term stocks to buy according to Warren Buffett include The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO), American Express Company (NYSE:AXP), and Bank of America Corporation (NYSE:BAC). Our MethodologyWe selected the stocks from the Q4 portfolio of Berkshire which have been part of the fund's portfolio for at least 5 years.

Over the past several years, GM has taken steps necessary to focus the company on the most profitable segments and move into position to compete in an electrified and autonomous world. With the recent rise in interest rates there was a meaningful selloff in the auto industry, which presented us with an attractive entry point to a name we know well.”9. Visa Inc.

(NYSE:V) in its Q3 2022 investor letter:“The largest sector change in the rebalance was a six-percentage point increase in technology. The biggest component of this increase was the introduction of a 4% weight in Apple, which is discussed further below. Offsetting this increased tech weight was a 3-percentage point decrease in industrials and a two-percentage point decline in health care. The other two largest purchases include Visa Inc. (NYSE:V) and Abbott Labs which likewise saw their valuations improve as their estimated free cash flows held up or improved while their enterprise values declined.”8. VeriSign, Inc. (NASDAQ:VRSN)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 37Berkshire’s Holding Period: 10 YearsBerkshire’s Stake Value: $2,632,839,535VeriSign, Inc.

Despite the fact that the overall economic conditions are likely to continue to negatively impact consumers, which could affect the sector as a whole, the analyst believes that the challenging macro environment is already reflected in share performance and estimate revisions.

DaVita Inc. (NYSE:DVA)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 30Berkshire’s Holding Period: 11 YearsBerkshire’s Stake Value: $2,695,256,212DaVita Inc.

The analyst informed investors that healthcare service providers have been affected by inflationary pressures in 2022, and DaVita has managed these challenges exceptionally well.

Roughly 500,000 patients receive kidney dialysis in the U.S., which requires a 3.5-hour treatment three times a week. The only alternatives to the treatments are a kidney transplant or potential fatality. Given the critical nature of its services, demand has little correlation with the overall economy, resulting in a highly recession resistant business.The U.S. dialysis industry is highly concentrated, with two companies (DaVita and its competitor Fresenius) controlling a combined 80% of the $25 billion market. The dominance of this duopoly provides massive scale advantages, making it incredibly difficult for new entrants to gain profitable market share.In the past, DaVita’s valuation has been penalized (we view unfairly) because the company generates a significant portion of its operating income from a small percentage of its patients. Of DaVita’s 200,000 patients, approximately 90% qualify for Medicare (or Medicaid), with the remaining 10% covered by a commercial insurance provider. While commercial insurers pay an average of $1,000 per treatment, the federal government’s pay rate for Medicare and Medicaid is only $275 – which is actually less than what it costs DVA to provide the treatment…”(Click here to read the full text)6. Moody's Corporation (NYSE:MCO)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 63Berkshire’s Holding Period: 12 YearsBerkshire’s Stake Value: $6,873,493,546Moody's Corporation (NYSE:MCO) is a New York-based integrated risk assessment firm that publishes credit ratings and provides assessment services on various debt obligations, programs and facilities, and entities that issue such obligations. Moody's Corporation (NYSE:MCO) has been in the Berkshire portfolio for 12 years. Buffett owns a $6.8 billion position in the company. On January 31, Moody's Corporation (NYSE:MCO) reported a Q4 non-GAAP EPS of $1.60, beating market estimates by $0.13. The revenue of $1.29 billion outperformed Wall Street consensus by $20 million. For FY2023, the company expects revenue to increase in the mid-to-high single digit percent range and adjusted diluted EPS of $9 to $9.50, versus a consensus of $9.28.Ashish Sabadra, an analyst from RBC Capital, increased the target price for Moody's Corporation (NYSE:MCO) on February 1 from $329 to $350 and maintained an Outperform rating on the company's shares after it exceeded Q4 earnings expectations. In a research note to investors, the analyst said that the company's FY23 guidance may be too cautious because of the anticipated strong recovery in issuance. Additionally, RBC Capital thinks that Moody's projected buyback guidance for 2023 is conservative and will result in only about half of its free cash flows being returned to shareholders.According to Insider Monkey’s third quarter database, 63 hedge funds were long Moody's Corporation (NYSE:MCO), compared to 48 funds in the preceding quarter. Chris Hohn’s TCI Fund Management is a significant position holder in the company, with 8.2 million shares worth $2 billion. In addition to The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO), American Express Company (NYSE:AXP), and Bank of America Corporation (NYSE:BAC), Moody's Corporation (NYSE:MCO) has featured on the Berkshire portfolio for several years.  Here is what Qualivian Investment Partners has to say about Moody’s Corporation (NYSE:MCO) in its Q2 2021 investor letter:“Moody’s: Revenue, operating profit margins, and EPS all exceeded expectations, and annual guidance for these items (and for free cash flow) was raised.

370,896902ab-c55d-3f88-8e96-c5760a25258c,DVA,2023-02-16,Earnings Preview: DaVita HealthCare (DVA) Q4 Earnings Expected to Decline,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/earnings-preview-davita-healthcare-dva-150003814.html,1676473203,STORY,"['DVA', 'ELAN']","[DaVita HealthCare (DVA) is expected to deliver a year-over-year decline in earnings on lower revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended December 2022. This widely-known consensus outlook gives a good sense of the company's earnings picture, but how the actual results compare to these estimates is a powerful factor that could impact its near-term stock price.The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report, which is expected to be released on February 22. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call, it's worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise.Zacks Consensus EstimateThis kidney dialysis provider is expected to post quarterly earnings of $0.88 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of -56.4%.Revenues are expected to be $2.94 billion, down 0.2% from the year-ago quarter.Estimate Revisions TrendThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has remained unchanged over the last 30 days. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts.Earnings WhisperEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. Our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) -- has this insight at its core.The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Story continuesThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for DaVita HealthCare?For DaVita HealthCare, the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of -1.71%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #4.So, this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that DaVita HealthCare will beat the consensus EPS estimate.Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?While calculating estimates for a company's future earnings, analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that DaVita HealthCare would post earnings of $1.65 per share when it actually produced earnings of $1.45, delivering a surprise of -12.12%.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates two times.Bottom LineAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.DaVita HealthCare doesn't appear a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.An Industry Player's Expected ResultsAmong the stocks in the Zacks Medical - Outpatient and Home Healthcare industry, Elanco Animal Health Incorporated (ELAN) is soon expected to post earnings of $0.13 per share for the quarter ended December 2022. This estimate indicates a year-over-year change of -38.1%. This quarter's revenue is expected to be $980.41 million, down 11.9% from the year-ago quarter.Over the last 30 days, the consensus EPS estimate for Elanco Animal Health Incorporated has been revised 5.2% down to the current level. Nevertheless, the company now has an Earnings ESP of -6.80%, reflecting a lower Most Accurate Estimate.When combined with a Zacks Rank of #5 (Strong Sell), this Earnings ESP makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Elanco Animal Health Incorporated will beat the consensus EPS estimate. The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters.Stay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

In Q4 2022, Warren Buffett significantly reduced his investment in Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (NYSE:TSM) only a few months after disclosing a substantial stake. This rapid turnaround by the famous stock picker has spooked investors, and sentiment towards the chip giant has dampened as a result. Berkshire Hathaway reduced its ownership of Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (NYSE:TSM)'s American depositary receipts by 86% in the fourth quarter, according to the latest filings. If Berkshire sold the shares at the average price during that time, the sale of the stake would have raked in $3.7 billion. In the wake of this announcement, the stock prices of the world's largest chip manufacturer declined by up to 4% in Taipei, contributing to widespread losses in the market.Tony Huang, vice president at Taishin Securities Investment Advisory Co, told Bloomberg on February 15: “It’s surprising that Berkshire cut its holding so much in just a quarter, which differs from its past practice of long-term investment and continuing to add shares.”While Berkshire Hathaway opted to sell its holdings in Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (NYSE:TSM), it added 333,856 shares to its position in Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL). For Q4 2022, Apple reported its worst revenue results for a holiday season in seven years.Some of the best long-term stocks to buy according to Warren Buffett include The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO), American Express Company (NYSE:AXP), and Bank of America Corporation (NYSE:BAC). Our MethodologyWe selected the stocks from the Q4 portfolio of Berkshire which have been part of the fund's portfolio for at least 5 years.

Over the past several years, GM has taken steps necessary to focus the company on the most profitable segments and move into position to compete in an electrified and autonomous world. With the recent rise in interest rates there was a meaningful selloff in the auto industry, which presented us with an attractive entry point to a name we know well.”9. Visa Inc.

The biggest component of this increase was the introduction of a 4% weight in Apple, which is discussed further below. Offsetting this increased tech weight was a 3-percentage point decrease in industrials and a two-percentage point decline in health care. The other two largest purchases include Visa Inc. (NYSE:V) and Abbott Labs which likewise saw their valuations improve as their estimated free cash flows held up or improved while their enterprise values declined.”8. VeriSign, Inc.

MTTR and TuSimple Holdings Inc. TSP.Industry: Tech ServicesLink: https://www.zacks.com/commentary/2053977/3-stocks-to-watch-from-a-promising-technology-services-industryOngoing digitization, increasing dependency on technology and initiatives to diversify technology services have been boosting the prospects of the Zacks Technology Services industry. Growth opportunities from the robust adoption of the multi-cloud model should offset challenges arising from cyber threats and expenditures related to hiring skillful talent and restructuring initiatives.Trane Technologies plc, Matterport, Inc. and TuSimple Holdings Inc. are some stocks, which are likely to gain from the abovementioned industry trends.Industry DescriptionThe Zacks Technology Services industry comprises companies that are engaged in manufacturing, developing and designing an array of software support, data processing, computing hardware and communications equipment. These include integrated powertrain technologies, advanced analytics, technology solutions and contract research services, semiconductor packaging and interconnect technologies, collaboration software, specialty printers, and data acquisition and analysis systems.The industry includes consumer as well as business-oriented products and services. It comprises companies with diversified end-markets and customer base. Some industry participants also provide advanced analytics, clinical research services, data storage technology and solutions, and technology-enabled financial solutions to consumers, small business owners, tax professionals.What's Shaping the Future of the Technology Services Industry?Remote &amp; Hybrid Work Model Trends Boost Prospects: The industry's growth is expected to accelerate in the days ahead based on an increasing number of remote and hybrid workers. In this era of digital transformation, enterprises are actively seeking a common ground between on-premise and cloud infrastructures, enabling them to provide flexible, as well as easily adaptable hybrid solutions. The coronavirus-induced remote-working trend has led to increased demand for cloud and cost-efficient business support solutions, as well as other digital monetization solutions, which bode well for the industry.Story continuesDigitization Wave is a Tailwind: Most industry participants are in the process of modernizing their traditional legacy-oriented business processes to keep themselves updated with evolving IT services. The aim is to integrate synergies of emerging technologies, including the cloud, the Internet of Things, Artificial Intelligence and analytics. Moreover, increasing Internet penetration in emerging markets, particularly across the Asia-Pacific, is a tailwind.Adoption of the Multi-Cloud Model: The growing uptake of the multi-cloud model to achieve better scalability and attain improved resource utilization is also expanding the scope of the industry participants. Cloud and hardware/software virtual technologies are anticipated to favorably impact the industry. As growth and investment opportunities in developed countries continue to slow down, we believe that emerging economies will play a crucial role in the days ahead.Growing Cyber Attacks a Tailwind: The increasing number of cyber-attacks and related security risks are expected to keep the industry's momentum alive. Government agencies are ideal targets for cyber-attacks, as they are entrusted with sensitive information. Therefore, the growing need for cyber security solutions and services in critical areas like defense, intelligence and civilian agencies of the U.S. government bodes well for the industry players.Talent Cost Woes: Rising spending on acquiring skilled talent and restructuring initiatives involving modernization of the IT-service infrastructure are causing higher debt levels, R&amp;D, and sales &amp; marketing expenses.Zacks Industry Rank Indicates Encouraging ProspectsThe Zacks Technology Services industry, which is housed within the broader Zacks Business Services sector, currently carries a Zacks Industry Rank #101. This rank places it in the top 40% of more than 250 Zacks industries.The group's Zacks Industry Rank, which is basically the average of the Zacks Rank of all member stocks, indicates dull near-term prospects. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperforms the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.Before we present a few stocks that investors can buy or retain given their sturdy potential, let's take a look at the industry's recent stock market performance and current valuation.Industry Underperforms Sector and S&amp;P 500The Zacks Technology Services industry has lagged the broader Zacks Business Services sector as well as the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite over the past year.The industry has declined 31.1% over this period compared with a 15.5% decline of the broader sector and an 8.7% downside of the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite.Industry's Current ValuationOn the basis of EV-to-EBITDA (enterprise value to earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization), which is commonly used for valuing technology services stocks, the industry is currently trading at 40.55X compared with the S&amp;P 500's 12.03X and the sector's 24.98X.Over the past year, the industry has traded as high as 53.68X, as low as 14.37X and at the median of 27.87X.3 Key Technology Services PicksWe are presenting three stocks that are well-positioned to grow in the near term.Trane Technologies: Trane remains focused on improving the quality of its products and services and operating efficiencies to achieve sustained improvement in earnings and cash flow. It prioritizes improving its business operating system and innovation through business transformation initiatives and prudent investments. Trane has a track record of repurchasing shares and paying dividends consistently.TT's 2023 guidance looks encouraging. Trane expects revenues to increase 7-9% on a reported basis and 6-8% on an organic basis. Adjusted EPS is expected between $8.20 and $8.50. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Trane's 2023 EPS has improved 4.8% in the past 90 days. TT stock has gained 21.2% over the past year. It carries a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Matterport: This California-based spatial data company focuses on digitization and datafication of the built world. Matterport's top line is likely to benefit from strength across subscription and annual recurring revenues.

374,4f992897-331d-3e17-846a-a906ebe87539,SRE,2023-02-16,SoCalGas Updates Customers on Current Natural Gas Prices,PR Newswire,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/socalgas-updates-customers-current-natural-020600275.html,1676513160,STORY,['SRE'],"[Market conditions improve: critical out-of-state pipeline service restored; experts also cite improved weather conditions and related decrease in natural gas demand as contributing to lower market prices SoCalGas continues to encourage customers to conserve as natural gas markets remain sensitive to changing weather and maintenance updates LOS ANGELES, Feb. 15, 2023 /PRNewswire/ -- Southern California Gas Company (SoCalGas) today provided customers with an update on natural gas prices across the West Coast. After a significant drop from unprecedented January natural gas commodity prices, market prices for March, 2023 are currently trending closer to 2022 prices.Improved weather conditions and a related reduction in natural gas usage have led prices to continue to fall along the West Coast, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA), which is charged with collecting, analyzing and disseminating independent and impartial energy information. In addition, the restoration of service to the out-of-state pipeline, which has been offline for two years, is expected to increase supply capacity to the Southwest by as much as 500 million cubic feet per day. However, the markets where SoCalGas purchases natural gas remain volatile and sensitive to changing weather and maintenance updates.""It is still too early to tell if this positive trend will continue, but with warmer weather ahead, we do not expect to see price swings as large as we saw earlier in the winter,"" said Gillian Wright, chief customer officer for SoCalGas.Consistent with regulatory requirements, SoCalGas will file March core procurement prices (rates) with the California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC) at the end of February. The core procurement rate reflects the price SoCalGas pays for natural gas for residential and business customers. That rate changes each month. SoCalGas does not set the price for natural gas. Instead, natural gas prices are determined by national and regional markets. SoCalGas buys natural gas in those markets on behalf of residential and small business customers, and the cost of buying that gas is billed to those customers with no markup.Story continuesThe markets where SoCalGas purchases natural gas remain volatile and sensitive to changing weather and maintenance updates. For example, consistent with applicable rules and regulations, SoCalGas issued a notice Tuesday about a about a safety related condition resulting in a capacity reduction on another natural gas pipeline - Line 235.What caused prices to spike in the first place?According to the EIA, several factors contributed to higher natural gas commodity prices:Widespread, below-normal temperatures on much of the West Coast, including Washington and Oregon;High natural gas demand for heating by customers in areas with below normal temperatures;Reduced natural gas supplies to the West Coast from Canada;Reduced interstate pipeline capacity to the West Coast because of pipeline maintenance activities in West Texas (the out-of-state pipeline mentioned earlier in this release); andLow natural gas storage levels in the Pacific Region.A detailed report about these market conditions can be found here: https://www.eia.gov/naturalgas/weekly/archivenew_ngwu/2022/12_22/.Experts weigh in on natural gas market conditionsA number of experts have weighed in on the market conditions that led to unprecedented natural gas prices in December. The California Public Utilities Commission last week held a public hearing to discuss those conditions.Alan Mayberry, associate administrator for pipeline safety for the United States Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration (PHMSA) told the CPUC his agency authorized the return to service of the out-of-state pipeline identified by EIA as one source of high January's high prices. ""As of yesterday, we gave Kinder Morgan (the pipeline's owner and operator) the go-ahead to return Line 2000 to their normal operating pressure,"" Mayberry told the CPUC. On Tuesday, Feb 15 Kinder Morgan lifted operational restrictions on the out-of-state pipeline.According to the EIA, the pipeline's return to full service will increase natural gas takeaway capacity out of West Texas by close to 500 million cubic feet per day, increasing supply into the Desert Southwest.What is SoCalGas doing for its customers?In January, SoCalGas tripled its contribution to the Gas Assistance Fund, increasing it to $1 million. This program helps income-qualified customers pay their natural gas bills with a one-time $100 grant.Customers also should see some relief soon, courtesy of the CPUC accelerating the California Climate Credit. SoCalGas customers will receive a credit of $50.77 in their February or March bill, depending on their billing cycle.In addition, SoCalGas continues to encourage customers to take advantage of programs and services that can help manage and save costs.SoCalGas' free Ways to Save tool may also help customers find ways to save on natural gas bills, with a personalized savings plan that offers a household energy analysis, customized energy-efficiency recommendations, bill comparisons and energy usage comparisons. Ways to Save can be found at socalgas.com/WaysToSave. Customers can also sign up for weekly Bill Tracker Alerts to monitor natural gas consumption, take steps to reduce usage, and avoid bill surprises.Eligible customers may sign up for a Level Pay Plan (LPP), for example, which averages their annual natural gas use and costs over 12 months. There are also financial assistance programs for eligible customers who are experiencing hardships.SoCalGas also offers the following tips to help potentially reduce energy usage:Lowering your thermostat three to five degrees – if health permits – can save up to 10 percent on heating costs.Installing proper caulking and weather-stripping can save roughly 10 to 15 percent on heating and cooling bills.Washing clothes in cold water to save up to 10 percent on water heating costs.Considering turning down the temperature on your water heater, keeping in mind that most hot water heaters require a temperature of 120 degrees or higher.Limiting use of non-essential natural gas appliances such as spas and fireplaces.Customers can visit socalgas.com/ManageHigherBills for more information on the factors that lead to higher bills and ways we can help.About SoCalGas Headquartered in Los Angeles, SoCalGas® is the largest gas distribution utility in the United States.

We continued to improve our aggregates unit profitability and demonstrate the resiliency of our business. Our relentless focus on our operating disciplines, coupled with nimble pricing actions to overcome inflationary pressures, led to a 12 percent increase in our full-year Adjusted EBITDA. Fourth quarter results were negatively impacted by abnormally wet and cold weather that disrupted construction activity and materials shipments, in addition to some softening in single-family residential demand. Despite these disruptions, our industry-leading aggregates cash gross profit per ton increased 11 percent in the fourth quarter. We carry solid pricing momentum into 2023 and are focused on our operating disciplines to manage costs and improve efficiencies. By controlling what we can control, we expect to deliver another year of earnings growth.""Story continuesSegment ResultsAggregatesSegment gross profit increased in the fourth quarter despite lower shipments due mostly to unfavorable weather. Fourth quarter gross profit increased to $327 million, or $6.04 per ton; shipments declined 6 percent. In early October, the lingering effects of Hurricane Ian slowed shipments in certain southeastern markets while significant rainfall and extreme winter temperatures impacted November and December construction activity across many markets. The prior year's fourth quarter weather was unusually mild, amplifying this year's weather impact. Quarterly shipments were also impacted by the absence of tons available from the Company's Mexico operations, which were unexpectedly and arbitrarily shut down by the Mexican government in May of 2022.Fourth quarter freight-adjusted selling prices increased 14 percent, or $2.05 per ton, and increases were widespread across the Company's footprint. Freight-adjusted pricing for the full year was $16.40 per ton, an increase of $1.53 per ton, or 10 percent, over the prior year. Adjusting for mix impacts, average selling prices increased 15 percent in the fourth quarter and 11 percent for the full year.Notwithstanding the challenging weather conditions in the fourth quarter, solid operational execution helped offset continued energy cost headwinds and inflationary pressures for many parts and supplies. Freight-adjusted unit cash cost of sales increased 17 percent, or $1.27 per ton, as compared to the prior year's fourth quarter. The average unit price of diesel fuel in the fourth quarter increased 61 percent from the prior year. Excluding the impact of higher diesel fuel costs, freight-adjusted cash cost of sales increased 11 percent.Unit profitability expansion accelerated throughout the year with fourth quarter gross profit per ton increasing 7 percent and cash gross profit per ton increasing 11 percent. For the full year, cash gross profit per ton improved 5 percent to $7.83 per ton.Asphalt, Concrete and CalciumAsphalt segment gross profit was $17 million, an increase of $13 million over the prior year's fourth quarter, as pricing actions initiated throughout the year outpaced higher input costs. Fourth quarter shipments were 2.8 million tons, a 2 percent decline versus the prior year. Asphalt pricing increased 24 percent, or $14.56 per ton, more than offsetting a 24 percent increase in the unit cost of liquid asphalt and driving strong unit profitability improvement versus the prior year. For the full year, asphalt gross profit improved $36 million with robust pricing gains overcoming a 36 percent increase in the unit cost of liquid asphalt. Volume improved 7 percent for the year, benefiting from solid growth in Arizona and California, the Company's two largest asphalt markets, as well as acquisitions completed during 2022. Full-year cash gross profit was $92 million, a 62 percent increase versus the prior year.Fourth quarter Concrete segment gross profit was $17 million lower than the prior year due to lower volumes and higher costs for diesel fuel. Shipments of 2.3 million cubic yards were 15 percent lower than the prior year. The year-over-year decline resulted from significant rainfall in Texas and California and some slowdown in residential construction activity. Additionally, the Company divested its concrete operations in New York, New Jersey and Pennsylvania in November. Average selling prices increased 14 percent, partially offsetting higher raw materials, diesel and labor costs. For the full year, concrete gross profit improved $35 million, benefiting from the earnings contribution of acquisitions. Cash gross profit for the full year was $172 million.Full year Calcium segment gross profit was $2.6 million compared to $2.2 million in the prior year.Selling, Administrative and General (SAG) and Other ItemsSAG expense in the quarter was $126 million, or 7.3 percent of total revenues. Full year SAG expense was $515 million, or 7.0 percent of total revenues, a 50-basis points improvement versus the prior year.In the fourth quarter, we completed the disposition of our concrete operations in New York, New Jersey and Pennsylvania, resulting in an incremental pretax loss on sale of $17 million ($13 million after-tax) to the estimate recorded in the third quarter.Financial Position, Liquidity and Capital AllocationCapital expenditures in the fourth quarter were $266 million, including growth projects. For the full year, capital expenditures were $644 million. In 2023, the Company expects to spend $600 to $650 million, including growth projects. The Company will continue to review its plans and will adjust as needed, while being thoughtful about preserving liquidity.On December 31, 2022, the ratio of total debt to trailing-twelve-months Adjusted EBITDA was 2.4 times (2.3 times on a net debt basis), down from 2.7 times (2.5 times on a net debt basis) at the end of 2021. The Company remains committed to its stated long-term target leverage range of 2.0 to 2.5 times total debt to trailing-twelve-months Adjusted EBITDA.On a trailing-twelve-months basis, return on average invested capital was 13.5 percent. The Company is focused on driving improvement through solid operating earnings growth coupled with disciplined capital management.OutlookRegarding the Company's outlook, Mr. Hill said, ""Most leading indicators of demand remain healthy in the near term, and we carry strong pricing momentum into 2023. Overall shipments will be dependent upon the depth and duration of the decline in residential construction activity, the timing of highway starts converting to aggregates shipments, and the impact of rising interest rates on private nonresidential construction activity as the year progresses. We are encouraged by the strength in leading indicators that support growth in public construction activity, particularly highways, and we are well positioned to benefit in geographic markets where the need is greatest. On the private side, slowing single-family construction activity has outweighed continued growth in multi-family, leading to overall declines in residential demand. Nonresidential demand remains at healthy levels and continues to benefit from manufacturing and other heavy industrial projects. As always, we are focused on the things we can control, and our execution on our operating and commercial disciplines will lead to further improvement in our aggregates unit profitability and earnings growth in 2023.""Management expectations for 2023 include:Continued acceleration in Aggregates segment cash gross profit per ton improvement ($7.83 in 2022)Total Asphalt, Concrete and Calcium segment cash gross profit collectively in line with 2022 ($268 million in 2022)Selling, Administrative and General expenses of $515 to $530 millionInterest expense of approximately $195 millionDepreciation, depletion, accretion, and amortization expense of approximately $610 millionAn effective tax rate of approximately 22 percentNet earnings attributable to Vulcan of between $715 and $835 millionAdjusted EBITDA of between $1.725 and $1.875 billionConference Call Vulcan will host a conference call at 10:00 a.m. CT on February 16, 2023.

This compares to earnings of $3.15 per share a year ago. These figures are adjusted for non-recurring items.This quarterly report represents an earnings surprise of 0.33%. A quarter ago, it was expected that this seller of granite, limestone, sand and gravel would post earnings of $4.74 per share when it actually produced earnings of $4.69, delivering a surprise of -1.05%.Over the last four quarters, the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates two times.Martin Marietta , which belongs to the Zacks Building Products - Concrete and Aggregates industry, posted revenues of $1.38 billion for the quarter ended December 2022, missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 3.72%. This compares to year-ago revenues of $1.4 billion. The company has topped consensus revenue estimates three times over the last four quarters.The sustainability of the stock's immediate price movement based on the recently-released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's commentary on the earnings call.Martin Marietta shares have added about 5.4% since the beginning of the year versus the S&amp;P 500's gain of 7.7%.What's Next for Martin Marietta?While Martin Marietta has underperformed the market so far this year, the question that comes to investors' minds is: what's next for the stock?There are no easy answers to this key question, but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company's earnings outlook. Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter(s), but also how these expectations have changed lately.Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near-term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions. Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried-and-tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank, which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions.Story continuesAhead of this earnings release, the estimate revisions trend for Martin Marietta: unfavorable. While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company's just-released earnings report, the current status translates into a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) for the stock. So, the shares are expected to underperform the market in the near future. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.It will be interesting to see how estimates for the coming quarters and current fiscal year change in the days ahead. The current consensus EPS estimate is $0.88 on $1.18 billion in revenues for the coming quarter and $14.66 on $6.32 billion in revenues for the current fiscal year.Investors should be mindful of the fact that the outlook for the industry can have a material impact on the performance of the stock as well. In terms of the Zacks Industry Rank, Building Products - Concrete and Aggregates is currently in the bottom 24% of the 250 plus Zacks industries. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperform the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.One other stock from the same industry, Vulcan Materials (VMC), is yet to report results for the quarter ended December 2022. The results are expected to be released on February 16.This construction materials company is expected to post quarterly earnings of $1.29 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +3.2%. The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 0.2% lower over the last 30 days to the current level.Vulcan Materials' revenues are expected to be $1.82 billion, up 13.3% from the year-ago quarter.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

That is, insiders sold more stock than they bought.While we would never suggest that investors should base their decisions solely on what the directors of a company have been doing, logic dictates you should pay some attention to whether insiders are buying or selling shares. Check out our latest analysis for Valero Energy The Last 12 Months Of Insider Transactions At Valero EnergyIn the last twelve months, the biggest single sale by an insider was when the President &amp; COO, R. Riggs, sold US$2.0m worth of shares at a price of US$132 per share. That means that an insider was selling shares at slightly below the current price (US$136). When an insider sells below the current price, it suggests that they considered that lower price to be fair. That makes us wonder what they think of the (higher) recent valuation. While insider selling is not a positive sign, we can't be sure if it does mean insiders think the shares are fully valued, so it's only a weak sign. We note that the biggest single sale was only 5.6% of R. Riggs's holding. The only individual insider seller over the last year was R. Riggs.You can see a visual depiction of insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last 12 months, below.

Usually, the higher the insider ownership, the more likely it is that insiders will be incentivised to build the company for the long term. Valero Energy insiders own 0.4% of the company, currently worth about US$221m based on the recent share price. This kind of significant ownership by insiders does generally increase the chance that the company is run in the interest of all shareholders.Story continuesWhat Might The Insider Transactions At Valero Energy Tell Us?It doesn't really mean much that no insider has traded Valero Energy shares in the last quarter. It's heartening that insiders own plenty of stock, but we'd like to see more insider buying, since the last year of Valero Energy insider transactions don't fill us with confidence. While we like knowing what's going on with the insider's ownership and transactions, we make sure to also consider what risks are facing a stock before making any investment decision.

Today's Research Daily features new research reports on 16 major stocks, including Merck &amp; Co., Inc. (MRK), Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc. (TMO) and American Express Co. (AXP). These research reports have been hand-picked from the roughly 70 reports published by our analyst team today.You can see all of today’s research reports here &gt;&gt;&gt;Merck’s shares have outperformed the Zacks Large Cap Pharmaceuticals industry over the past year (+39.8% vs. +11.8%). Drugs like Keytruda and Gardasil (HPV vaccine) have been driving sales. With continued label expansion into new indications &amp; early-stage settings, Keytruda is expected to remain a key top-line driver.Animal health and vaccine products are core growth drivers. Its new COVID oral antiviral pill, Lagevrio, has become a key top-line driver in 2022. Merck boasts a strong cancer pipeline, including Keytruda, which should help drive long-term growth.However, generic competition for several drugs and rising competitive pressure, mainly on the diabetes franchise, will continue to be overhangs on the top line. There are concerns about Merck’s ability to grow its non-oncology business ahead of Keytruda’s loss of exclusivity later in the decade.(You can read the full research report on Merck here &gt;&gt;&gt;)Shares of Thermo Fisher Scientific have outperformed the Zacks Medical - Instruments industry over the past year (+2.7% vs. -12.0%). The company’s robust year-over-year revenue growth in the Analytical Instruments and the Laboratory Products and Biopharma Services segments appears promising.Thermo Fisher’s accelerated investments to expand bioproduction capacity also buoy optimism. In the quarter, Thermo Fisher witnessed strength in three out of its four end markets. The upbeat guidance for 2022 is indicative that this growth momentum will continue.However, the year-over-year decline in revenues in the Life Science Solutions and Specialty Diagnostics segment is disappointing. The contraction of both margins on escalating costs and expenses does not bode well either. The year-over-year decline in adjusted earnings is concerning.(You can read the full research report on Thermo Fisher Scientific here &gt;&gt;&gt;)Shares of American Express have declined -8.6% over the past year against the Zacks Financial - Miscellaneous Services industry’s decline of -17.7%. Due to higher utilization of the company’s cards, expense in the form of card member services and card member rewards is likely to go up and strain the company's margins. Also, marketing and business development expenses are expected to rise, hurting the bottom line. As such, the stock warrants a cautious stance.Nevertheless, American Express have adopted several growth initiatives, such as launching new products, enhancing existing features, reaching new agreements and forging alliances, are boosting its revenues. Consumer spending on travel and entertainment, which carry higher margins for AmEx, is advancing well.The company’s balance sheet looks strong with manageable debt. Solid cash-generation abilities enable the pursuit of business investments and capital deployment via share buybacks and dividends.(You can read the full research report on American Express here &gt;&gt;&gt;)Other noteworthy reports we are featuring today Valero Energy Corp.

Higher Gulf Coast export volumes will also support its margins.Expanding Solar Market Aid Enphase (ENPH) Amid Supply WoesPer the Zacks analyst, the expanding solar market tends to benefit Enphase. However, constrained component supply conditions may adversely impact its revenues and results of operations.Operational Excellence Aids Weyerhaeuser (WY), Low Sales HurtPer the Zacks analyst, Weyerhaeuser's focus on operational excellence plans is encouraging. However, weak demand &amp; macroeconomic uncertainty raise concern.Hewlett Packard (HPE) Benefits From Spurt in Aruba ServicesPer the Zacks analyst, a strong uptick in Aruba Services is driving Hewlett Packard's Intelligent Edge segment, which in turn, helps sustain its supremacy in the market with high growth opportunity.Strong End Market Aids Berry Global (BERY), High Debt HurtsPer the Zacks analyst, Berry Global will benefit from strength across food service, hygiene, retail food and beverage end markets. However, the company's high debt level remains concerning.Digital Transformation, Buyouts Aid DXC Technology (DXC)Per the Zacks analyst, DXC Technology is benefiting from ongoing digital transformations and adoption of its solutions.

383,8605a6b4-cf34-330d-967c-979f5b21fb29,VLO,2023-02-16,5 Stocks With High ROE to Buy as Inflation Blows Hot Again,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/5-stocks-high-roe-buy-124612658.html,1676465172,STORY,"['CNHI', 'THO', 'HOLX', 'SUZ', 'VLO']","[The U.S. equity markets witnessed intense volatility in the past few trading sessions as inflationary pressures refused to abate, with the consumer price index (CPI) rising more than expected in January. The latest data revealed that CPI was up 0.5% in January following a 0.1% rise in December compared to broad-based expectations of a 0.4% increase. This, in turn, signified that inflation was still a force to reckon with and offered further ammunition to the Fed to continue its aggressive stance against it.A few days earlier, Fed had raised the interest rates by 25 basis points – much akin to the broader expectations – and kept the door ajar for future hikes as it indicated that the battle against inflation was far from over. It also expected economic growth to remain subdued in 2023. Average hourly earnings in January fell 0.2% on a sequential basis and were down 1.8% from a year ago. The uncertain business environment failed to paint a clearer picture of the overall economy and led to the cacophony that drove the broader equity market volatility.As investors employ a wait-and-see approach in a classic example of “backing and filling” in the market, they can benefit from “cash cow” stocks that garner higher returns. However, identifying cash-rich stocks alone does not make for a solid investment proposition unless it is backed by attractive efficiency ratios like return on equity (ROE). A high ROE ensures that the company is reinvesting cash at a high rate of return. THOR Industries, Inc. THO, CNH Industrial N.V. CNHI, Valero Energy Corporation VLO, Hologic, Inc. HOLX and Suzano S.A. SUZ are some of the stocks with high ROE to profit from.Why ROE?ROE = Net Income/Shareholders’ EquityROE helps investors distinguish profit-generating companies from profit burners and is useful in determining the financial health of a company. In other words, this financial metric enables investors to identify companies that diligently deploy cash for higher returns.Moreover, ROE is often used to compare the profitability of a company with other firms in the industry — the higher, the better. It measures how well a company is multiplying its profits without investing new equity capital and portrays management’s efficiency in rewarding shareholders with attractive risk-adjusted returns.Story continuesScreening ParametersIn order to shortlist stocks that are cash-rich with high ROE, we have added Cash Flow greater than $1 billion and ROE greater than X-Industry as our primary screening parameters. In addition, we have taken a few other criteria into consideration to arrive at a winning strategy.Price/Cash Flow lesser than X-Industry: This metric measures how much investors pay for $1 of free cash flow. A lower ratio indicates that investors need to pay less for a better cash flow-generating stock.Return on Assets (ROA) greater than X-Industry: This metric determines how much profit a company earns for every dollar of asset, which includes cash, accounts receivable, property, equipment, inventory and furniture. The higher the ROA, the better it is for the company.5-Year EPS Historical Growth greater than X-Industry: This criterion indicates that continued earnings momentum has translated into solid cash strength.   Zacks Rank less than or equal to 2: Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) stocks are known to outperform irrespective of the market environment.Here are five of the 22 stocks that qualified the screen:THOR Industries: Founded in 1980, Indiana-based Thor Industries is the largest manufacturer of RVs in the world.

384,c0077d24-79b9-3c9f-bf32-0203bf77afe1,UNH,2023-02-16,UnitedHealth Group Incorporated's (NYSE:UNH) Fundamentals Look Pretty Strong: Could The Market Be Wrong About The Stock?,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/unitedhealth-group-incorporateds-nyse-unh-120102314.html,1676548862,STORY,['UNH'],"[With its stock down 7.3% over the past three months, it is easy to disregard UnitedHealth Group (NYSE:UNH). However, stock prices are usually driven by a company’s financial performance over the long term, which in this case looks quite promising. In this article, we decided to focus on UnitedHealth Group's  ROE.Return on Equity or ROE is a test of how effectively a company is growing its value and managing investors’ money. Simply put, it is used to assess the profitability of a company in relation to its equity capital. See our latest analysis for UnitedHealth Group How Do You Calculate Return On Equity?Return on equity can be calculated by using the formula:Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' EquitySo, based on the above formula, the ROE for UnitedHealth Group is:24% = US$21b ÷ US$86b (Based on the trailing twelve months to December 2022).The 'return' is the profit over the last twelve months. So, this means that for every $1 of its shareholder's investments, the company generates a profit of $0.24.What Has ROE Got To Do With Earnings Growth?Thus far, we have learned that ROE measures how efficiently a company is generating its profits. Depending on how much of these profits the company reinvests or ""retains"", and how effectively it does so, we are then able to assess a company’s earnings growth potential. Generally speaking, other things being equal, firms with a high return on equity and profit retention, have a higher growth rate than firms that don’t share these attributes.UnitedHealth Group's Earnings Growth And 24% ROEFirstly, we acknowledge that UnitedHealth Group has a significantly high ROE. Second, a comparison with the average ROE reported by the industry of 13% also doesn't go unnoticed by us. Probably as a result of this, UnitedHealth Group was able to see a decent net income growth of 11% over the last five years.As a next step, we compared UnitedHealth Group's net income growth with the industry and were disappointed to see that the company's growth is lower than the industry average growth of 16% in the same period.Story continuespast-earnings-growthEarnings growth is a huge factor in stock valuation. It’s important for an investor to know whether the market has priced in the company's expected earnings growth (or decline). By doing so, they will have an idea if the stock is headed into clear blue waters or if swampy waters await. Has the market priced in the future outlook for UNH? You can find out in our latest intrinsic value infographic research report. Is UnitedHealth Group Making Efficient Use Of Its Profits?With a three-year median payout ratio of 30% (implying that the company retains 70% of its profits), it seems that UnitedHealth Group is reinvesting efficiently in a way that it sees respectable amount growth in its earnings and pays a dividend that's well covered.Moreover, UnitedHealth Group is determined to keep sharing its profits with shareholders which we infer from its long history of paying a dividend for at least ten years. Upon studying the latest analysts' consensus data, we found that the company is expected to keep paying out approximately 26% of its profits over the next three years. Therefore, the company's future ROE is also not expected to change by much with analysts predicting an ROE of 28%.SummaryOn the whole, we feel that UnitedHealth Group's performance has been quite good. Particularly, we like that the company is reinvesting heavily into its business, and at a high rate of return. As a result, the decent growth in its earnings is not surprising. The latest industry analyst forecasts show that the company is expected to maintain its current growth rate.

If you want to see more most profitable dividend stocks, go directly to 5 Most Profitable Dividend Stocks.Dividend stocks are stocks of companies that pay dividends.Many dividend stocks pay a dividend quarterly as a way to return excess capital back to shareholders. Companies can also use stock repurchases as another way to return excess capital back to shareholders. For those you interested check out 15 Companies That Are Buying Back Their Stock.When company profits rise, many companies tend to pay slightly higher dividends. When company profits decrease, many companies also decrease or even suspend their dividends.Considering the change in tax laws for stock repurchases beginning in 2023 given the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022, dividends could be slightly more attractive. As a result, some companies might be more inclined to return slightly more capital back to shareholders through dividends than stock repurchases.Jones Day describes the effect of the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022, ""U.S. (and in certain instances, non-U.S.) corporations, whose stock is traded on an established securities market, that undertake share repurchases of more than $1 million in the aggregate per tax year, will be subject to a 1% share excise tax on the value of any share repurchase unless such share repurchase is taxed as a dividend (other exceptions and exclusions may apply).""While the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 could affect dividend payments slightly, the largest determination of how much capital companies return through dividends will still likely be how much the companies make in profits in the near term and how much excess capital management of companies think they have.If there is a possibility of an economic slowdown or even a recession in the future, many companies may not raise their dividends even if their profits increase. If the economic slowdown or recession occurs, many companies will likely cut or even suspend their dividends.Story continuesIn terms of the possibility of an economic slowdown or a recession, the probability will depend on economic developments and how much further the Federal Reserve raises interest rates.Although inflation has cooled from their 2022 highs late last year, the Federal Reserve has indicated that it will raise rates further. If the U.S. central bank raises interest rates too much, there is potential for an economic slowdown or even a recession. If that happens, demand will soften for a lot of companies and company profits could decline.Given the uncertainty, it could be a good idea for long term investors to own a well diversified portfolio of leading stocks across many different sectors.Building, Real estate, HoldingMethodologyFor our list of 15 Most Profitable Dividend Stocks, we used the Fortune 500 list to find the most profitable American companies and we then filtered the list to find the stocks that paid dividends and that were profitable according to YCharts in terms of net income for the trailing twelve months.Because we used YCharts data, the net income may not be the same as adjusted profit.For some stocks, the trailing twelve months isn't the same time period as it for others given some stocks have not reported their fourth quarter earnings results yet.15 Most Profitable Dividend Stocks15.

You can skip our detailed analysis of the early retirement phenomenon and dividend stocks, and go directly to read Early Retirement Portfolio: 5 Stocks to Live Off Dividends. Due to the onset of the pandemic in 2020, early retirement gained a steady pace among Americans. According to a report by New York Times, millennial workers plan to retire in their 50s to pursue their interests. However, their financial condition suggests otherwise. The report showed results from the Global Benefits Attitudes Survey, revealing that 36% of millennial workers were just saving around 5% of their income, which is not sufficient to cover living expenses post-retirement.The financial instability, coupled with growing inflation, has somewhat altered investor sentiment who are now delaying their retirement plans. According to a survey conducted by the Nationwide Retirement Institute, 40% of US workers ages 45 years or above are holding up on their retirement, which is twice the number of workers who asserted the same last year. The survey also mentioned that only 58% of the workers are positive about their retirement plans, down from 74% in 2021. This was also supported by data from Natixis Investment Managers, which highlighted that 58% of high-net-worth individuals plan to work beyond their retirement age due to market uncertainty.As major stocks and bonds fell in 2022, retiree investors are turning to stocks that offer long-term growth and can generate stable income. Over the years, dividend stocks have shown promising performance, becoming investors’ top choices in times of financial instability. Moreover, companies with long dividend growth streaks and positive cash flow generation are also great investment options for retirees. Among these companies are PepsiCo, Inc. (NASDAQ:PEP), AbbVie Inc. (NYSE:ABBV), and Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) who have raised their dividends for decades, even during market turmoil. Readers can also have a look at 30 Best Stocks for Retirement, which discusses dividends retirement stocks in detail.Story continuesLast year, I wrote an article on Early Retirement Portfolio: 15 Stocks to Live Off Dividends, which listed dividend companies derived from different user platforms. With soaring inflation and risks of recession, it was time to update that list and focus on stocks that offer passive income opportunities to retiree investors. This list includes stocks that have impressive track records of making regular dividend payments and have raised their payouts for at least 10 years. For this reason, some of the stocks from the previous list were replaced by those that regularly increase their payouts. Costco Wholesale Corporation (NASDAQ:COST), Raytheon Technologies Corporation (NYSE:RTX), Kellogg Company (NYSE:K), Eastman Chemical Company (NYSE:EMN), Realty Income Corporation (NYSE:O), Walgreens Boots Alliance, Inc. (NASDAQ:WBA), and AT&amp;T Inc. (NYSE:T) still make it to our list of the best dividend stocks for early retirement among others.Early Retirement Portfolio: 15 Stocks to Live Off Dividends RevisitedCopyright: halfpoint / 123RF Stock PhotoOur Methodology:For this list, we selected companies that have raised their payouts for over 10 years and generated stable returns over the years.

The collective value of these stakes is over $4.08 billion.Rowan Street Capital mentioned The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG) in its Q4 2022 investor letter. Here is what the firm has to say:“Let’s look at The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG). Dividend yield is 2.4%. Earnings are forecasted to grow at 5.9%, and its current earnings multiple is at 25x. Now, lets say over the next 3-5 years the market loses interest in the “safe”, mature companies that grow at anemic rates and gets an appetite for growth again. It’s very unlikely that Mr. Market will be paying 25x for 5.9% earnings growth. Lets assume that multiple declines to the market average of 18x — that would be ~6.9% drag per year on the total expected return over next 3-5 years. If we get 2.4% (dividend) + 5.9% (earnings growth) – 6.9% (decrease in earnings multiple) = 1.4% (annual return we can expect on average from this stock).”11. The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO)Dividend Yield as of February 14: 2.90%The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) has kept its dividends steady during previous inflationary periods.

Overall, 59 hedge funds in Insider Monkey’s database owned investments in the company in Q3, worth over $25 billion.Rowan Street Capital mentioned The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) in its Q4 2022 investor letter. Here is what the firm has to say:“Let’s take The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) for example. Its dividend yield is 2.8%, earnings are estimated to grow at only 3.6% rate per year over next 4 years, and its earnings multiple is currently at 24x (based on next years forecasted earnings). KO has an anemic growth, so we can argue that paying 24x earnings is not very attractive. Let’s assume that the multiple will stay constant over the next 3-5 years, thus our expected annual returns will be 2.8%+3.6% = 6.4% (that is below the current reported inflation rate and only slightly above the risk-free rate of 4%).”10.

Major stock indexes suffered a huge blow last year. However, the Dow suffered the least.Dow Changes Course in 2023In 2022, the Dow fell 8.8% year over year, while the S&amp;P 500 and the Nasdaq Composite plummeted 19.4% and 33.1%, respectively. Last year, the Fed raised the benchmark interest rate by 4.25% to combat 40-year high inflation.A higher interest rate is detrimental to growth stocks like consumer discretionary and technology. In contrast to the Nasdaq Composite and the S&amp;P 500 indexes, the 30-stock Dow is more inclined to cyclical stocks than growth stocks. Therefore, the index suffered the least. However, the situation has taken a turn in 2023.Dow Lags Peers Year to DateLess-than-expected inflation rates in October, November and December with respect to several measures have clearly indicated this. On Jan 31, the Department of Labor reported that the employment cost index for fourth-quarter 2022 rose 1%, below the consensus mark of a 1.2% rise. The metric for third-quarter 2022 was also 1.2%. The data clearly indicates that the wage rate, a major source of current inflation, is declining as expected by the Fed.On Feb 1, in its February FOMC meeting, the Fed hiked the benchmark interest rate by 25 basis points to the range of 4.50% to 4.75%, marking its highest rate since late 2007. Market participants are expecting two more rate hikes of 25 basis points each in 2023.Story continuesThe technology sector is no longer overvalued. We are seeing early signs of market participants' confidence returning to this sector. Of the three major stock indexes — year to date — The S&amp;P 500 and the Nasdaq Composite advanced 7.8% and 13.6%, respectively. The Dow gained just 3.3%.U.S. Economy CoolingThe U.S. economy expanded 2.9% in fourth-quarter 2022. Although the metric exceeded the consensus mark of 2.6%, it declined from the third-quarter's growth rate of 3.2%. The latest projection by the Atlanta Fed revealed that the U.S. economy may have expanded by 2.2% in first-quarter 2023.A devastated housing market owing to the high mortgage rate, disappointing retail sales in December, the peak festive season, huge inventory accumulation by several retailers, a sharp fall in U.S. manufacturing activities and a notable decline in factory orders and industrial production indicated that the U.S. economy is cooling in the direction desired by the Fed.Moreover, several U.S. corporate behemoths have already retrenched manpower to a good extent at high levels. Lack of earnings visibility due to some near-term concerns related to business opportunities is the primary reason for recent job cuts.Market participants are expecting more softness in consumer spending and a decline in business spending due to a margin squeeze resulting in moderate GDP growth. Powell also warned of some toughness going forward. As a result, growth and momentum stocks may underperform cyclical value stocks in 2023.

On the call today from management for our opening comments are Steven Roth, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Michael Franco, President and Chief Financial Officer. Our senior team is also present and available for questions. I will now turn the call over to Steven Roth.Story continuesSteven Roth: Thank you, Steve, and good morning, everyone. It's Valentine's Day. As Michael will cover in a moment, 2022 was a strong year with comparable FFO up 10%. Fourth quarter FFO was down 11% due to higher interest rates. Ex-rising interest rates, our core business is performing quite well. Not surprisingly, we expect 2023 will be a down year, negatively impacted by a full year of higher rates. I'd like to share with you a few other thoughts. Notwithstanding all the noise, New York continues to be the most important city in America. We continuously survey dozens and dozens of our tenants all of whom reaffirm their commitment to stay and grow in New York. And that goes for our clients who are headquartered in other cities who are making New York their, so to speak, second home.And it's not by chance that the New York area is the tightest residential market in the country. People want to live here. Steel, concrete and curtain wall are important, but in our business capital is the essential raw material. We are now in the middle of a Federal Reserve's tightening cycle, the result of which is interest rates are up and capital is scarce. And that's an understatement. Notwithstanding Fed funds at 5% most run of the mill real estate operators can't borrow at 10% or can't borrow at all. So here's what we have done. Several years ago, when we began the Farley Facebook PENN 1 and PENN 2 projects and are all important PENN district. We loaded in over $2 billion in cash to pre fund 100% of our development and construction course.We didn't know then how precious this would be. So Farley Facebook is now finished and paid for. And PENN 1 almost so and PENN 2 will finish the round year end. All three of these assets will be free and clear and unencumbered. And that's quite a feat. We handled all of our 2023 and 2024 maturities. We put on a series of swaps in caps, but found very helpful. They provide only partial protection. And I would observe that there really is no protection against loans that mature in a rising interest rate market. And a further observation is that the stock market prices at then current interest rates, giving no credit to a company which might have lower rate loans, even if they're locked in for term. Beginning first quarter of this year, we declare a right size dividend allowing us to retain 128 million of cash annually.And by the way, our stock chose trades still trades at a too high 6.5% yield. In January, we completed an important deal with Citadel at our 350 Park Samuel building, which involved their master leasing the entire 585,000 square foot building, essentially relieving us of 225,000 square feet of vacancy. This deal will almost certainly result in a tear down at a new build of a grand 1.7 million square foot tower on a larger assembled site. Please see our press release of December 9, 2022 explaining the transaction. We have lots of friends on Wall Street and I might venture that by any measure return on equity or return per employee or whatever Citadel is at the head of the class, intensely focused and aggressively growing. This deal validates the quality of our site, our development team, as new.Interestingly, Ken tells me that a significant differentiator for his firm is the simple fact that everybody comes to work every day, five days a week. I think they start at 7:30 There is a learning here, call me crazy, but I think companies that embrace work from home will be left behind. And I think it's absurd to think that years from now 10s of millions of Americans will be working from home alone at their kitchen table. And by the way, Zoom may be a disrupter. But his stock is down from 588 to a still high 75 today. You will notice in our supplement that we updated our development projections for Farley PENN 1 and PENN 2 raising our aggregate projected returns. This based on the fact that in 2022 we'd be sorted 25,000 square feet of Penn2 an average fighting rates in the 90s.And based as well on the outstanding market reaction we are getting to PENN 1 and PENN 2. Our strategy here is to achieve very strong returns at rents well below those required for new construction. The PENN 1 ground lease process is now kicking off as required by GAAP accounting convention. In the first quarter of 2022 we estimated a ground lease of 26 billion and reflected that in our statements. Based on current market conditions, we now think that numbers should be quite a bit lower. We expect 2023 will be challenging as business and consumers continue to feel the effect of the Feds aggressive rate increases and generally tighten their belts and act with caution. This will likely be reflected at lower leasing volumes at frozen capital markets.Buildings, Real estate, BuyingPhoto by Maxim Tirdea on UnsplashWe believe quality product wins today. Just look at our new bills, new lobbies, amenities at Penn1, new scale at PENN 2 etc. Not long ago, new construction commanded a $20 premium. Now it commands a $100 premium or more. Does anybody think that's too high and that the market will adjust? One more point and this is an important one. In the history of legal real estate all great upward landlord markets followed a period of constrained supply and here we are. Capital markets are now making it almost impossible to build new, which will be the fourth pillar to the next bull market and landlords market. Now over to Michael.Michael Franco: Thank you, Steve. And good morning, everyone. As Steve mentioned, we had a strong year despite experiencing headwinds from rising interest rates. For the year comparable FFO as adjusted was $3.15 per share up $0.29 or 10.1% from 2021. Fourth quarter comparable FFO as adjusted was $0.72 per share, compared to $0.81 for last year's fourth quarter, a decrease of $0.9 or 11.1%. While earnings for the quarter were down driven primarily by higher net interest expense from increase rates and the non-cash straight line impact of the estimated 2023 PENN 1 ground and expense. Our core business had strong performance from the rent commencement and new office and retail leases. We have provided a quarter-over-quarter bridge in earnings released in our financial supplement.We have several non comparable items in the quarter from early gains from 220 Central Park, South sales and other non-core asset dispositions, which in total increased FFO by an $0.18 per share. As previously announced we recorded 595 million of non-cash impairment charges during the fourth quarter of which approximately 483 million was released for equity investment in the Fifth Avenue and Times Square retails joint venture. It should be noted as impairment charges not included and FFO. Companywide same store cash NOI for the fourth quarter increased by 7.9% over the prior year's fourth quarter. Our overall same store office business was up 8% compared to the prior year's fourth quarter. Our New York same store office business was up 5.4% primarily due to cash rents at Farley coming online.Our retail same store cash NOI was up a very strong 7.9% primarily due to the rent commencement on several important leases. Now turning to 2023. While the current economic environment makes forecasting more difficult than usual, we expect our 2023 comparable FFO to be down from 2022 given the known impact of certain items. These include roughly $0.40 from additional interest expense as a result of a full year of higher rates on a variable rate debt net of higher interest income and capitalized interest assuming the current silver curve. $0.10 from the prior period property tax accrual at the mark was recognized during the second half of 2022 and $0.5 of lower FFO from the sale of assets in 2022. These reductions could potentially be offset by a lower result on the PENN 1 ground rent reset that's currently running through earnings, which Steve mentioned earlier.Now turning to the leasing markets. We see 2023 as the year both challenges and opportunities. The pace of leasing has slowed in the past few months and the activity is lumpier as businesses generally are feeling cost pressures, and are exercising more caution. Companies are still grappling with hybrid work policies and the right level of flexibility. But overall sentiment is shifting more closely at pre-pandemic norms. We are seeing a real pickup in the return to office throughout our portfolio, particularly Tuesday through Thursday. Utilization rates are approaching 60% and momentum is improving month by month. Both employers and employees clearly recognize the productivity, collaboration, creativity and cultural benefits of working in the office together.Flight to quality continues to be the prevalent theme for tenants. However, leasing activity is broadening out. We are seeing a pickup in activity in the traditional multi-tenant Class A buildings as tenants are dealing with the aforementioned cost pressures and are not all willing to pay new construction rents. One thing we do think will begin to emerge this year is a heightened focus on the quality of the landlord. Many landlords particularly private ones are beginning to struggle with high leverage levels, which may limit their ability to invest capital in their buildings or in some cases even retain their assets. Tenants and their brokers are smart enough to figure out which buildings these issues are at and avoid them. Strong well capitalized landlords like Coronado will benefit.A perfect example of flight to quality with strong sponsorship as the previously announced 350 Park Avenue transit action with Citadel. We began our relationship with Citadel 350 Park in the beginning of 2020 with an initial 120,000 square foot lease, and are proud of the relationship we have built with our team, which has culminated in this master lease in the future potential partnership for a new 1.7 million square foot world class building at the site. Our overall leasing pipeline in New York remains healthy at almost 1.2 million square feet of leases, with 275,000 square feet of leases being finalized in another 900,000 square feet of activity in various stages in negotiation. The financial sector in particular continues to be active. Turning to retail.With the rebound and tourism and daily workers we're continuing to see more retailers search Manhattan for new store locations. Retailer sales, generally back in the pre-pandemic levels, which is spurring retailers to become more confident and active and taking new spaces. They're still concerned about inflation the overall economy but are starting to lock in deals given rents are much more attractive levels. Turning to the capital markets now. The financing markets remain highly constrained, driven by the volatility from the feds sharp rate increases. Thanks for dealing with an increase in problem loans and remain cautious and lending and the CMBS market is still largely close. But financing is available for the highest quality sponsors and properties the markets will take some time to thaw, which likely won't happen until the Fed ends its tightening cycle.On the asset sale front that continues to be active interested investors in New York office and retail asset. But without a stable financing market it remains difficult to transact large assets without in place debt right now. In these volatile times, we remain focused on maintaining balance sheet strength. Our current liquidity is a strong $3.4 billion, including 1.5 billion of cash, restricted cash and investments in U.S. T-Bill and 1.9 billion undrawn under our $2.5 billion revolving credit facilities. In addition, as a result of our refinancing activities early last year, we have no significant maturities through mid 2024. With that, I'll turn it over the operator for Q&amp;A.See also 25 Largest Pizza Chains in the World and 10 Least Innovative Companies that are still in Business.To continue reading the Q&amp;A session, please click here.]"

396,ff67bcb7-5e5a-3983-b75f-69e68d850492,AFL,2023-02-16,Why Aflac (AFL) is a Top Dividend Stock for Your Portfolio,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/why-aflac-afl-top-dividend-164504642.html,1676479504,STORY,['AFL'],"[Getting big returns from financial portfolios, whether through stocks, bonds, ETFs, other securities, or a combination of all, is an investor's dream. However, when you're an income investor, your primary focus is generating consistent cash flow from each of your liquid investments.While cash flow can come from bond interest or interest from other types of investments, income investors hone in on dividends. A dividend is that coveted distribution of a company's earnings paid out to shareholders, and investors often view it by its dividend yield, a metric that measures the dividend as a percent of the current stock price. Many academic studies show that dividends make up large portions of long-term returns, and in many cases, dividend contributions surpass one-third of total returns.Aflac in FocusHeadquartered in Columbus, Aflac (AFL) is a Finance stock that has seen a price change of -3.79% so far this year. The insurer is currently shelling out a dividend of $0.4 per share, with a dividend yield of 2.43%. This compares to the Insurance - Accident and Health industry's yield of 2.29% and the S&amp;P 500's yield of 1.57%.Taking a look at the company's dividend growth, its current annualized dividend of $1.68 is up 5% from last year. In the past five-year period, Aflac has increased its dividend 5 times on a year-over-year basis for an average annual increase of 10.76%. Looking ahead, future dividend growth will be dependent on earnings growth and payout ratio, which is the proportion of a company's annual earnings per share that it pays out as a dividend. Aflac's current payout ratio is 30%. This means it paid out 30% of its trailing 12-month EPS as dividend.Looking at this fiscal year, AFL expects solid earnings growth. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2023 is $5.60 per share, which represents a year-over-year growth rate of 5.07%.Bottom LineInvestors like dividends for a variety of different reasons, from tax advantages and decreasing overall portfolio risk to considerably improving stock investing profits. However, not all companies offer a quarterly payout.Story continuesBig, established firms that have more secure profits are often seen as the best dividend options, but it's fairly uncommon to see high-growth businesses or tech start-ups offer their stockholders a dividend. Income investors have to be mindful of the fact that high-yielding stocks tend to struggle during periods of rising interest rates. That said, they can take comfort from the fact that AFL is not only an attractive dividend play, but also represents a compelling investment opportunity with a Zacks Rank of #1 (Strong Buy).Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

397,8317ee7e-f97e-3f1b-ae7a-ddff88ceb1dc,SHW,2023-02-16,Does Sherwin-Williams (NYSE:SHW) Deserve A Spot On Your Watchlist?,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/does-sherwin-williams-nyse-shw-130206545.html,1676552526,STORY,['SHW'],"[It's common for many investors, especially those who are inexperienced, to buy shares in companies with a good story even if these companies are loss-making. Sometimes these stories can cloud the minds of investors, leading them to invest with their emotions rather than on the merit of good company fundamentals. Loss making companies can act like a sponge for capital - so investors should be cautious that they're not throwing good money after bad.In contrast to all that, many investors prefer to focus on companies like Sherwin-Williams (NYSE:SHW), which has not only revenues, but also profits. Now this is not to say that the company presents the best investment opportunity around, but profitability is a key component to success in business. View our latest analysis for Sherwin-Williams How Fast Is Sherwin-Williams Growing?The market is a voting machine in the short term, but a weighing machine in the long term, so you'd expect share price to follow earnings per share (EPS) outcomes eventually. Therefore, there are plenty of investors who like to buy shares in companies that are growing EPS. Over the last three years, Sherwin-Williams has grown EPS by 12% per year. That's a good rate of growth, if it can be sustained.Top-line growth is a great indicator that growth is sustainable, and combined with a high earnings before interest and taxation (EBIT) margin, it's a great way for a company to maintain a competitive advantage in the market. While we note Sherwin-Williams achieved similar EBIT margins to last year, revenue grew by a solid 11% to US$22b. That's encouraging news for the company!The chart below shows how the company's bottom and top lines have progressed over time. To see the actual numbers, click on the chart.earnings-and-revenue-historyIn investing, as in life, the future matters more than the past. So why not check out this free interactive visualization of Sherwin-Williams' forecast profits?Are Sherwin-Williams Insiders Aligned With All Shareholders?It's said that there's no smoke without fire. For investors, insider buying is often the smoke that indicates which stocks could set the market alight. That's because insider buying often indicates that those closest to the company have confidence that the share price will perform well. However, small purchases are not always indicative of conviction, and insiders don't always get it right.Story continuesAlthough we did see some insider selling (worth US$401k) this was overshadowed by a mountain of buying, totalling US$1.3m in just one year. We find this encouraging because it suggests they are optimistic about Sherwin-Williams'future. It is also worth noting that it was Chairman &amp; CEO John Morikis who made the biggest single purchase, worth US$519k, paying US$260 per share.Along with the insider buying, another encouraging sign for Sherwin-Williams is that insiders, as a group, have a considerable shareholding. Indeed, they have a considerable amount of wealth invested in it, currently valued at US$170m. This comes in at 0.3% of shares in the company, which is a fair amount of a business of this size. This should still be a great incentive for management to maximise shareholder value.Does Sherwin-Williams Deserve A Spot On Your Watchlist?One positive for Sherwin-Williams is that it is growing EPS. That's nice to see. On top of that, we've seen insiders buying shares even though they already own plenty. These factors alone make the company an interesting prospect for your watchlist, as well as continuing research. However, before you get too excited we've discovered 1 warning sign for Sherwin-Williams that you should be aware of.The good news is that Sherwin-Williams is not the only growth stock with insider buying. Here's  a list of them... with insider buying in the last three months!Please note the insider transactions discussed in this article refer to reportable transactions in the relevant jurisdiction.Have feedback on this article?

Fourth quarter and full year 2021 results included a gain of $2.70 per share, which reflected the completion of the sale of HOS in December of 2021. Fourth quarter and full year 2021 results were $0.85 per share and $4.25 per share, respectively, before the gain on the sale of HOS.""American Water successfully executed on our strategies in 2022, achieved on-plan earnings growth, and again delivered strong dividend growth to investors. Importantly, we achieved constructive outcomes in general rate cases in three of our largest jurisdictions - New Jersey, Pennsylvania, and Illinois,"" said Susan Hardwick, president and CEO of American Water.""We invested a record $2.6 billion across our business, led by infrastructure renewal, and completed 26 regulated acquisitions during the year. We are also proud that 2022 marked our best year of safety performance on record, and that we established additional GHG emissions reduction goals, including a net zero target by 2050,"" added Hardwick. ""We are excited about this positive momentum as we begin 2023.""2023 EPS Guidance and Long-Term Financial Targets AffirmedThe Company affirms its 2023 earnings per share guidance range of $4.72 to $4.82. The Company also affirms its long-term financial targets for the 2023-2027 period announced in Nov. 2022, including its long-term EPS and dividend growth rate targets of 7-9%. The Company’s earnings forecasts are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties, including, without limitation, those described under ""Cautionary Statement Concerning Forward-Looking Statements"" below and under ""Risk Factors"" in its annual, quarterly, and current reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (""SEC""). All statements related to earnings and earnings per share refer to diluted earnings and earnings per share.Story continuesHighlightsDelivered EPS results of $4.51 slightly ahead of expectations, led by strong growth in the Regulated BusinessesSuccessfully completed general rate cases in New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Illinois, West Virginia, and HawaiiIncorporated updated production costs in New Jersey and received authorization of a pension and OPEB deferral effective January 1, 2023Incorporated updated production costs and pension and OPEB costs in Pennsylvania and IllinoisInvested a record $2.3 billion for infrastructure improvements and replacements in 2022Closed on 26 acquisitions of various regulated water and wastewater systems in 2022, adding a record 70,000 customer connections, totaling $0.3 billion of investmentAnnounced new medium-term and long-term GHG emissions reduction targets aligning with the Paris AgreementPublished inclusion, diversity &amp; equity (ID&amp;E) metrics report​ with consolidated EEO-1 data and launched diversityataw.com​Consolidated ResultsFor the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2022, earnings per share were $0.81 and $4.51, respectively, compared to $3.55 and $6.95 per share in the same periods in 2021. The 2021 results included a net gain of $2.70 per share relating to the sale of HOS. Before the gain related to the sale of HOS in 2021, earnings per share increased $0.26 in 2022 as compared to 2021. This increase was primarily driven by continued growth in the Regulated Businesses from the return on infrastructure investments, acquisitions, and organic customer growth, offset somewhat by impacts from inflationary pressures on production costs and higher interest costs along with higher depreciation expenses from the growth of the business. Results for 2022 also reflect the favorable impact of weather, estimated at $0.06 per share, primarily due to hot and dry weather in the third quarter of 2022, as compared to a modest favorable impact from weather in 2021. Also, included in the results for 2022 are $0.24 per share from interest income earned on the seller note and income earned on revenue share agreements, which compares to HOS operating results for 2021 of $0.31 per share. Lastly, operating results for the Company’s New York subsidiary, which was sold on January 1, 2022, were $0.12 per share in 2021.In 2022, the Company made capital investments of $2.6 billion, including $2.3 billion for infrastructure improvements and other capital investments in the Regulated Businesses and $0.3 billion for regulated acquisitions.Regulated BusinessesIn the fourth quarter of 2022, the Regulated Businesses’ net income was $173 million, compared to $166 million for the same period in 2021. For the full year 2022, the Regulated Businesses’ net income was $854 million, compared to $789 million in 2021. Net income attributable to the Company’s New York subsidiary was $4 million and $21 million for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2021, respectively.Operating revenues increased $61 million and $248 million for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2022, respectively, as compared to 2021, when excluding revenues contributed by the Company’s New York subsidiary in 2021. The increases in operating revenues were primarily a result of authorized revenue increases resulting from completed general rate cases and infrastructure proceedings to recover incremental capital and acquisition investments.Since January 1, 2022, the Company has been authorized additional annualized revenues of approximately $308 million from general rate cases, with $90 million effective in 2022 and $218 million effective in 2023. Further, approximately $108 million of additional annualized revenues from infrastructure surcharges have been authorized, with $83 million effective in 2022 and $25 million effective in 2023. The Company has general rate cases in progress in three jurisdictions and filed for two infrastructure surcharges, reflecting a total annualized revenue request of approximately $181 million.Excluding impacts of the Company’s New York subsidiary in 2021, operation and maintenance (""O&amp;M"") expenses were higher by $24 million and $68 million for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2022, respectively, as compared to 2021, primarily due to increases in production costs from inflationary pressures. Also, depreciation expense was higher by $8 million and $32 million in these same periods due to the growing capital investment in infrastructure and acquisitions.For the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2021, results included revenues of $30 million and $127 million, respectively, and operating expenses of $23 million and $94 million, respectively, for the Company’s New York subsidiary that was sold on January 1, 2022.For the full year 2022, the Company’s adjusted regulated O&amp;M efficiency ratio (a non-GAAP financial measure) was 33.7%, compared to 34.1% for 2021. The ratio reflects an increase in operating revenues for the Regulated Businesses, after considering the adjustment for the amortization of the excess accumulated deferred income taxes (""EADIT"") shown in the table below, as well as the continued focus on operating costs.OtherIn the fourth quarter of 2022, the net loss in Other was $26 million, compared to net income of $479 million for the same period in 2021. For the year ended 2022, the net loss in Other was $34 million, compared to net income of $474 million for the same period in 2021. The primary driver for the change in both periods is the gain on the sale of HOS of $478 million in 2021, the loss of earnings from HOS operations as a result of the sale of the business in 2021, and incremental interest expense on long-term debt in 2022. The loss of HOS operating results has been partially offset in both periods of 2022 with interest income earned on the seller note from the sale and continuing income earned on revenue share agreements. As previously disclosed, results in 2022 also reflect $0.06 per share of favorable impact from post-close adjustments related to the sale of HOS and the Company’s New York subsidiary.DividendsOn December 7, 2022, the Company’s Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend payment of $0.6550 per share of common stock payable on March 1, 2023, to shareholders of record as of February 7, 2023.2022 Fourth Quarter and Year-End Earnings Conference CallThe conference call to discuss fourth quarter and year-end 2022 earnings, and affirmation of 2023 earnings guidance, and long-term targets will take place on Thursday, February 16, 2023, at 9 a.m. Eastern Standard Time.

The Company recognizes its website as a key channel of distribution to reach public investors and as a means of disclosing material non-public information to comply with its obligations under SEC Regulation FD.Following the earnings conference call, a replay of the audio webcast will be available for one year on American Water’s investor relations website at ir.amwater.com/events.Non-GAAP Financial MeasuresThis press release includes a presentation of adjusted regulated O&amp;M efficiency ratio, a ""non-GAAP financial measure"" under SEC rules, which excludes from its calculation estimated purchased water revenues and purchased water expenses, reductions for the amortization of EADIT, and the allocable portion of non-O&amp;M support services costs, mainly depreciation and general taxes. These items were excluded from the O&amp;M efficiency ratio calculation as they do not reflect management’s ability to increase the efficiency of the Regulated Businesses. This item is derived from American Water’s consolidated financial information but is not presented in its financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP. This non-GAAP financial measure supplements and should be read in conjunction with the Company’s GAAP disclosures and should be considered as an addition to, and not a substitute for, any GAAP measure.Management evaluates its operating performance using this ratio and believes that this non-GAAP financial measure is useful to the Company’s investors because it directly measures improvement in the operating performance and efficiency of the Company’s Regulated Businesses. The Company’s adjusted regulated O&amp;M efficiency ratio (i) is not an accounting measure that is based on GAAP; (ii) is not based on a standard, objective industry definition or method of calculation; (iii) may not be comparable to other companies’ operating measures; and (iv) should not be used in place of the GAAP information provided elsewhere in this press release.Set forth in this release is a table that calculates the Company’s adjusted regulated O&amp;M efficiency ratio and reconciles each of the components used to calculate this ratio to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure.About American WaterWith a history dating back to 1886, American Water is the largest and most geographically diverse U.S. publicly-traded water and wastewater utility company.

But which of these two stocks presents investors with the better value opportunity right now? Let's take a closer look.Everyone has their own methods for finding great value opportunities, but our model includes pairing an impressive grade in the Value category of our Style Scores system with a strong Zacks Rank. The proven Zacks Rank puts an emphasis on earnings estimates and estimate revisions, while our Style Scores work to identify stocks with specific traits.Veolia Environnement SA has a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy), while American Water Works has a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold) right now. This system places an emphasis on companies that have seen positive earnings estimate revisions, so investors should feel comfortable knowing that VEOEY is likely seeing its earnings outlook improve to a greater extent. But this is just one piece of the puzzle for value investors.Value investors also try to analyze a wide range of traditional figures and metrics to help determine whether a company is undervalued at its current share price levels.The Value category of the Style Scores system identifies undervalued companies by looking at a number of key metrics. These include the long-favored P/E ratio, P/S ratio, earnings yield, cash flow per share, and a variety of other fundamentals that help us determine a company's fair value.VEOEY currently has a forward P/E ratio of 17.10, while AWK has a forward P/E of 31.26. We also note that VEOEY has a PEG ratio of 1.46. This metric is used similarly to the famous P/E ratio, but the PEG ratio also takes into account the stock's expected earnings growth rate. AWK currently has a PEG ratio of 3.87.Another notable valuation metric for VEOEY is its P/B ratio of 1.31. The P/B is a method of comparing a stock's market value to its book value, which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities. By comparison, AWK has a P/B of 3.50.Story continuesThese metrics, and several others, help VEOEY earn a Value grade of A, while AWK has been given a Value grade of D.VEOEY has seen stronger estimate revision activity and sports more attractive valuation metrics than AWK, so it seems like value investors will conclude that VEOEY is the superior option right now.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

An upward trend in earnings estimates -- one of the most powerful forces impacting stock prices -- has triggered this rating change.The sole determinant of the Zacks rating is a company's changing earnings picture. The Zacks Consensus Estimate -- the consensus of EPS estimates from the sell-side analysts covering the stock -- for the current and following years is tracked by the system.Since a changing earnings picture is a powerful factor influencing near-term stock price movements, the Zacks rating system is very useful for individual investors. They may find it difficult to make decisions based on rating upgrades by Wall Street analysts, as these are mostly driven by subjective factors that are hard to see and measure in real time.As such, the Zacks rating upgrade for Freeport-McMoRan is essentially a positive comment on its earnings outlook that could have a favorable impact on its stock price.Most Powerful Force Impacting Stock PricesThe change in a company's future earnings potential, as reflected in earnings estimate revisions, has proven to be strongly correlated with the near-term price movement of its stock. The influence of institutional investors has a partial contribution to this relationship, as these big professionals use earnings and earnings estimates to calculate the fair value of a company's shares. An increase or decrease in earnings estimates in their valuation models simply results in higher or lower fair value for a stock, and institutional investors typically buy or sell it. Their transaction of large amounts of shares then leads to price movement for the stock.For Freeport-McMoRan, rising earnings estimates and the consequent rating upgrade fundamentally mean an improvement in the company's underlying business. And investors' appreciation of this improving business trend should push the stock higher.Story continuesHarnessing the Power of Earnings Estimate RevisionsEmpirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock movements, so it could be truly rewarding if such revisions are tracked for making an investment decision. Here is where the tried-and-tested Zacks Rank stock-rating system plays an important role, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions.The Zacks Rank stock-rating system, which uses four factors related to earnings estimates to classify stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), has an impressive externally-audited track record, with Zacks Rank #1 stocks generating an average annual return of +25% since 1988. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;.Earnings Estimate Revisions for Freeport-McMoRanFor the fiscal year ending December 2023, this mining company is expected to earn $1.94 per share, which is a change of -20.5% from the year-ago reported number.Analysts have been steadily raising their estimates for Freeport-McMoRan. Over the past three months, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company has increased 13.9%.Bottom LineUnlike the overly optimistic Wall Street analysts whose rating systems tend to be weighted toward favorable recommendations, the Zacks rating system maintains an equal proportion of 'buy' and 'sell' ratings for its entire universe of more than 4000 stocks at any point in time. Irrespective of market conditions, only the top 5% of the Zacks-covered stocks get a 'Strong Buy' rating and the next 15% get a 'Buy' rating. So, the placement of a stock in the top 20% of the Zacks-covered stocks indicates its superior earnings estimate revision feature, making it a solid candidate for producing market-beating returns in the near term.You can learn more about the Zacks Rank here &gt;&gt;&gt;The upgrade of Freeport-McMoRan to a Zacks Rank #2 positions it in the top 20% of the Zacks-covered stocks in terms of estimate revisions, implying that the stock might move higher in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

(NYSE: FCX) is pleased to announce the Copper Mark has been awarded to PT Freeport Indonesia (PT-FI). With this award, FCX has achieved the Copper Mark at all 12 of its eligible copper producing sites globally.

We recognize the critical role our products play in the global economy and in advancing and accelerating decarbonization. I am proud of our team for their accomplishments and ongoing commitment to responsible production practices.""The Copper Mark is a comprehensive assurance framework designed to demonstrate the copper industry's responsible production practices. In fourth-quarter 2022, the Copper Mark announced an extension of its framework to include molybdenum producers, among other metal producers. In addition to its primary mines, FCX’s four copper mines that produce byproduct molybdenum (Bagdad, Cerro Verde, Morenci and Sierrita) have also been awarded the Molybdenum Mark.To achieve the Copper Mark and Molybdenum Mark each site is required to complete a robust, independent external assurance process to assess conformance with 32 environmental, social and governance requirements. Awarded sites are required to be revalidated every three years.The Copper Mark seeks to promote transparency and accountability especially for sites that manage complex issues. The Copper Mark recognizes the unique site-specific considerations of PT-FI’s tailings management system. The extensive, independent onsite assessment of PT-FI confirmed the site’s full conformance with the current Copper Mark tailings requirements. The Copper Mark is in the process of developing additional guidance for participating sites with complex issues and PT-FI looks forward to working with them to demonstrate ongoing conformance of its tailings management system.Story continuesTo learn more about the Copper Mark and Molybdenum Mark, please see FCX’s website at: https://www.fcx.com/sustainability/coppermark.

You can skip our detailed analysis of the early retirement phenomenon and dividend stocks, and go directly to read Early Retirement Portfolio: 5 Stocks to Live Off Dividends. Due to the onset of the pandemic in 2020, early retirement gained a steady pace among Americans. According to a report by New York Times, millennial workers plan to retire in their 50s to pursue their interests. However, their financial condition suggests otherwise. The report showed results from the Global Benefits Attitudes Survey, revealing that 36% of millennial workers were just saving around 5% of their income, which is not sufficient to cover living expenses post-retirement.The financial instability, coupled with growing inflation, has somewhat altered investor sentiment who are now delaying their retirement plans. According to a survey conducted by the Nationwide Retirement Institute, 40% of US workers ages 45 years or above are holding up on their retirement, which is twice the number of workers who asserted the same last year. The survey also mentioned that only 58% of the workers are positive about their retirement plans, down from 74% in 2021. This was also supported by data from Natixis Investment Managers, which highlighted that 58% of high-net-worth individuals plan to work beyond their retirement age due to market uncertainty.As major stocks and bonds fell in 2022, retiree investors are turning to stocks that offer long-term growth and can generate stable income. Over the years, dividend stocks have shown promising performance, becoming investors’ top choices in times of financial instability. Moreover, companies with long dividend growth streaks and positive cash flow generation are also great investment options for retirees. Among these companies are PepsiCo, Inc. (NASDAQ:PEP), AbbVie Inc. (NYSE:ABBV), and Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) who have raised their dividends for decades, even during market turmoil. Readers can also have a look at 30 Best Stocks for Retirement, which discusses dividends retirement stocks in detail.Story continuesLast year, I wrote an article on Early Retirement Portfolio: 15 Stocks to Live Off Dividends, which listed dividend companies derived from different user platforms. With soaring inflation and risks of recession, it was time to update that list and focus on stocks that offer passive income opportunities to retiree investors. This list includes stocks that have impressive track records of making regular dividend payments and have raised their payouts for at least 10 years. For this reason, some of the stocks from the previous list were replaced by those that regularly increase their payouts. Costco Wholesale Corporation (NASDAQ:COST), Raytheon Technologies Corporation (NYSE:RTX), Kellogg Company (NYSE:K), Eastman Chemical Company (NYSE:EMN), Realty Income Corporation (NYSE:O), Walgreens Boots Alliance, Inc. (NASDAQ:WBA), and AT&amp;T Inc.

Here is what the firm has to say:“Let’s look at The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG). Dividend yield is 2.4%. Earnings are forecasted to grow at 5.9%, and its current earnings multiple is at 25x. Now, lets say over the next 3-5 years the market loses interest in the “safe”, mature companies that grow at anemic rates and gets an appetite for growth again. It’s very unlikely that Mr. Market will be paying 25x for 5.9% earnings growth. Lets assume that multiple declines to the market average of 18x — that would be ~6.9% drag per year on the total expected return over next 3-5 years. If we get 2.4% (dividend) + 5.9% (earnings growth) – 6.9% (decrease in earnings multiple) = 1.4% (annual return we can expect on average from this stock).”11. The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO)Dividend Yield as of February 14: 2.90%The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) has kept its dividends steady during previous inflationary periods.

Here is what the firm has to say:“Let’s take The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) for example. Its dividend yield is 2.8%, earnings are estimated to grow at only 3.6% rate per year over next 4 years, and its earnings multiple is currently at 24x (based on next years forecasted earnings). KO has an anemic growth, so we can argue that paying 24x earnings is not very attractive. Let’s assume that the multiple will stay constant over the next 3-5 years, thus our expected annual returns will be 2.8%+3.6% = 6.4% (that is below the current reported inflation rate and only slightly above the risk-free rate of 4%).”10.

The S&amp;P 500 and the Nasdaq recorded the worst week since December. Investors analyzed the recent commentary from Federal Reserve and mixed-to-upbeat economic data points. This has resulted in a rise in rates as the Fed is now believed to be hiking rates more than expected before.The U.S. benchmark treasury yield started the week at 3.63% and ended the week at 3.74% while the two-year U.S. treasury yield started the week at 4.44% and ended the week at 4.50%.

But biotechs have cut thousands of jobs lately. The ebbing pandemic resulted in lower demand for Covid-19 vaccines and treatments. The sector has underperformed due to research failures, slowing M&amp;A and rising interest rates.WSJ article pointed out “in recent weeks, Finch Therapeutics Group Inc. said it was halting development of its most advanced drug, making arrangements to sell its other assets and laying off 95% of its staff. In addition, privately held Goldfinch Bio Inc. shut down after failing to raise money. Vyant Bio Inc. said it was seeking strategic alternatives.”Pharmaceutical and other life-sciences companies laid off 7,387 people in 2022, according to the most recent data from global outplacement firm Challenger, Gray &amp; Christmas Inc.

The price target implies an upside of more than 6%.“We continue to recommend purchase of REGN shares and continue to model US Eylea revenue of $1,577M, $1,659M, $1,672M, and $1,668M for Q123-Q423, respectively,” the analysts said in a research note on Wednesday.Fourth quarter U.S. Eylea revenue of $1.5 billion missed consensus by $150 million, they said in the note, but since then the analysts have heard from investors that they are skeptical about the cause being attributed to a temporary shift to another off-label drug.The analysts point to a Spherix survey in early February of 75 ophthalmologists that indicates not only is Eylea share bouncing back, “it is approaching all-time highs.”“Bottom line – we think this feedback bodes well for a Q123 Eylea recovery and stable numbers at least until the high-dose launch later this year,” the analysts said.The company points to the successful trial of its 8-mg formulation. It expects approval to come this year.Related ArticlesRegeneron poised to benefit from bounce-back of eye drugSouth Korean banking shares plunge in New York after political pushNew Biden EV charger rules stress Made In America, force Tesla changes]"

(NASDAQ:CSCO) saw a double-digit share price rise of over 10% in the past couple of months on the NASDAQGS. With many analysts covering the large-cap stock, we may expect any price-sensitive announcements have already been factored into the stock’s share price. However, could the stock still be trading at a relatively cheap price? Let’s take a look at Cisco Systems’s outlook and value based on the most recent financial data to see if the opportunity still exists. View our latest analysis for Cisco Systems What Is Cisco Systems Worth?Good news, investors! Cisco Systems is still a bargain right now. According to my valuation, the intrinsic value for the stock is $69.17, but it is currently trading at US$48.45 on the share market, meaning that there is still an opportunity to buy now. Another thing to keep in mind is that Cisco Systems’s share price may be quite stable relative to the rest of the market, as indicated by its low beta. This means that if you believe the current share price should move towards its intrinsic value over time, a low beta could suggest it is not likely to reach that level anytime soon, and once it’s there, it may be hard to fall back down into an attractive buying range again.What does the future of Cisco Systems look like?earnings-and-revenue-growthInvestors looking for growth in their portfolio may want to consider the prospects of a company before buying its shares. Although value investors would argue that it’s the intrinsic value relative to the price that matter the most, a more compelling investment thesis would be high growth potential at a cheap price. With profit expected to grow by 20% over the next couple of years, the future seems bright for Cisco Systems. It looks like higher cash flow is on the cards for the stock, which should feed into a higher share valuation.What This Means For YouAre you a shareholder? Since CSCO is currently undervalued, it may be a great time to increase your holdings in the stock. With an optimistic outlook on the horizon, it seems like this growth has not yet been fully factored into the share price. However, there are also other factors such as financial health to consider, which could explain the current undervaluation.Story continuesAre you a potential investor? If you’ve been keeping an eye on CSCO for a while, now might be the time to enter the stock. Its prosperous future outlook isn’t fully reflected in the current share price yet, which means it’s not too late to buy CSCO. But before you make any investment decisions, consider other factors such as the track record of its management team, in order to make a well-informed buy.It can be quite valuable to consider what analysts expect for Cisco Systems from their most recent forecasts.
