Sometimes these stories can cloud the minds of investors, leading them to invest with their emotions rather than on the merit of good company fundamentals. Loss making companies can act like a sponge for capital - so investors should be cautious that they're not throwing good money after bad.Despite being in the age of tech-stock blue-sky investing, many investors still adopt a more traditional strategy; buying shares in profitable companies like Charles Schwab (NYSE:SCHW). While this doesn't necessarily speak to whether it's undervalued, the profitability of the business is enough to warrant some appreciation - especially if its growing. See our latest analysis for Charles Schwab Charles Schwab's Earnings Per Share Are GrowingIf a company can keep growing earnings per share (EPS) long enough, its share price should eventually follow. That means EPS growth is considered a real positive by most successful long-term investors. Charles Schwab managed to grow EPS by 7.2% per year, over three years. This may not be setting the world alight, but it does show that EPS is on the upwards trend.One way to double-check a company's growth is to look at how its revenue, and earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) margins are changing.

The equity has seen seven similar signals in the last three years, and was higher one month later 71% of the time, averaging a 7.5% gain. A move of similar magnitude would place SCHW near levels not seen since April. SCHW Chart January 042023Last seen up 2% to trade at $83.57, Charles Schwab stock's rally on the charts really began in earnest after a late-October breakout.

It has amassed assets over $29.03 billion, making it one of the largest ETFs attempting to match the Large Cap Blend segment of the US equity market.Why Large Cap BlendLarge cap companies usually have a market capitalization above $10 billion. Overall, they are usually a stable option, with less risk and more sure-fire cash flows than mid and small cap companies.Blend ETFs usually hold a mix of growth and value stocks as well as stocks that exhibit both value and growth characteristics.CostsSince cheaper funds tend to produce better results than more expensive funds, assuming all other factors remain equal, it is important for investors to pay attention to an ETF's expense ratio.Annual operating expenses for this ETF are 0.03%, making it one of the least expensive products in the space.It has a 12-month trailing dividend yield of 1.64%.Sector Exposure and Top HoldingsEven though ETFs offer diversified exposure that minimizes single stock risk, investors should also look at the actual holdings inside the fund. Luckily, most ETFs are very transparent products that disclose their holdings on a daily basis.This ETF has heaviest allocation to the Information Technology sector--about 26.40% of the portfolio. Healthcare and Financials round out the top three.Looking at individual holdings, Apple Inc (AAPL) accounts for about 6.78% of total assets, followed by Microsoft Corp (MSFT) and Amazon Com Inc (AMZN).The top 10 holdings account for about 26.15% of total assets under management.Performance and RiskSCHX seeks to match the performance of the Dow Jones U.S. Large-Cap Total Stock Market Index before fees and expenses. The Dow Jones U.S. Large-Cap Total Stock Market measures all U.S. equity securities with readily available prices. The index includes approximately the largest 750 stocks and is float-adjusted market-capitalization weighted.Story continuesThe ETF has lost about -0.47% so far this year and is down about -20.24% in the last one year (as of 01/04/2023). In the past 52-week period, it has traded between $42.25 and $56.29.The ETF has a beta of 1.01 and standard deviation of 25.53% for the trailing three-year period, making it a medium risk choice in the space. With about 756 holdings, it effectively diversifies company-specific risk.AlternativesSchwab U.S. LargeCap ETF carries a Zacks ETF Rank of 3 (Hold), which is based on expected asset class return, expense ratio, and momentum, among other factors. Thus, SCHX is a sufficient option for those seeking exposure to the Style Box - Large Cap Blend area of the market. Investors might also want to consider some other ETF options in the space.The iShares Core S&amp;P 500 ETF (IVV) and the SPDR S&amp;P 500 ETF (SPY) track a similar index.

The two 1700 V avalanche-rated EliteSiC Schottky diodes will help designers achieve stable high-voltage operation at high temperatures.ON has forayed into building these products to capitalize on the uptrend in the market for energy infrastructure.onsemi has a well-diversified business and is addressing other megatrends such as factory automation and electric vehicles. The company generates a significant percentage of revenues from each of the computing, consumer, industrial, communications and automotive markets. onsemi reported revenues of $2.19 billion in the third quarter of 2022, which beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 3.6% and improved 26% on a year-over-year basis.The company is reallocating capacity to strategic and high-margin products to drive a favorable mix shift and eliminate price-to-value discrepancies. To do so, onsemi is expanding its production capacity in strategic locations and closing fab locations in areas that are affecting its margin growth due to rising price surges in operating in those areas.ON Semiconductor Corporation Price and Consensus ON Semiconductor Corporation Price and ConsensusON Semiconductor Corporation price-consensus-chart | ON Semiconductor Corporation Quoteonsemi Boosting SiC Manufacturing Capacity to Drive Top LineThe entire Semiconductor - Analog and Mixed industry is reeling under various operational challenges due to a number of macroeconomic turmoils like raging inflation, the ongoing Russia-Ukraine war, forex market volatility and the looming recession. These can impact the performance capabilities and bottom-line growth of companies like onsemi, which has a significant debt burden.Story continuesAs of Sep 30, 2022, onsemi had a cash balance of $2.45 billion, whereas total debt (including the current portion) was $3.21 billion. A high debt position increases the risk profile of the business. Thus, the company is required to constantly generate an adequate amount of cash flows to meet debt requirements. Onsemi currently carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.However, despite its leveraged balance sheet, onsemi has been expanding its SiC facilities domestically and internationally to diversify its product portfolio. Per onsemi, the SiC total addressable market is projected to grow from $2 billion in 2021 to $6.5 billion in 2026, witnessing a CAGR of 33%.The company recently expanded its Hudson, NH-based facility, which will increase SiC boule production capacity by five times year over year. This will aid in meeting the rising demand for SiC-based solutions, which is critical for developing EVs and energy infrastructure, and is an important contributor to decarbonization.ON recently expanded its SiC facility in Roznov, Czech Republic, to expand SiC production capacity by 16 times. So far, ON has invested more than $150 million in the Roznov site and will look to spend an additional $300 million through 2023.onsemi, is not only expanding its production capacity. The company has recently completed the sale of its Niigata, Japan facility, which aligns with its fab liter strategy to expand the gross margin and reduce its fixed-cost footprint.Also, positively impacting the domestic expansion of onsemi’s SiC facilities is President Biden's decision to sign the CHIPS and Science Act. The act supports investments in domestic semiconductor manufacturing, and reducing dependence on foreign markets like China and Japan. Its peer Microchip Technology MCHP is also looking to benefit from the recent declaration of the act by the government.The government's recent declaration will help Microchip to diversify income from its microcontroller business, which is riddled with supply-chain disturbances. Microchip continues developing, and introducing a wide range of innovative and proprietary new linear, mixed-signal, power, interface and timing products to spur growth in the analog business.However, ON is facing stiff competition from Texas Instruments TXN and STMicroelectronics STM.STMicroelectronics’ third-generation STPOWER SiC MOSFETs help meet the energy-saving efficiency requirements in EVs and are chief competitors of onsemi in the EV market. STMicroelectronics’ solutions will help EV makers achieve faster charging and reduce EV weight, helping STM win a significant market share in the industry.Texas Instruments is also seeing success in certain fast-growing automotive market segments. TXN is focused on infotainment, safety and ADAS, body electronics (including lighting), hybrid electric vehicles and powertrain segments of the automotive market. It also experiences significant traction from the EV megatrend.onsemi, however, signed long-term supply agreements with various customers for the next three years, which are expected to help secure $1 billion of committed SiC revenues in 2023.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

The current discussions, which revived late last year, are in the early stage and could also end without an agreement, the people said.The companies, which have a joint venture that produces flash chips, have been circling each other for years. Western Digital rose 4.1% at 10:08 a.m. in New York trading Thursday, giving the company a value of about $11 billion.Talks between the competitors that were reported in 2021 failed to yield what could have been a $20 billion transaction. Closely held Kioxia, which is backed by Bain Capital and Toshiba Corp., also considered pursuing an initial public offering in 2021, though Chief Executive Officer Nobuo Hayasaka said in October it had no immediate plans for an IPO.Representatives for Western Digital and Kioxia declined to comment.Strategic ReviewIn June, Western Digital announced a review of strategic alternatives following discussions with activist investor Elliott Investment Management.A deal between Western Digital and Kioxia would build on a sometimes fractious partnership.Western Digital has provided Kioxia with funds for capital expenditure and research and development in return for production out of its Japanese partner’s plants. The relationship turned bitter when Western Digital, under a previous CEO, tried to acquire Kioxia when Toshiba was suffering financial difficulties as a result of its nuclear power division’s troubles.Story continuesThe current talks come as a sense of crisis in the industry as demand falls may persuade stakeholders and regulators to overcome reservations that have derailed deals in the past. The value of deals targeting semiconductor companies fell by more than a third last year to about $25 billion, with the largest being Intel Corp.’s purchase of Tower Semiconductor Ltd, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.Profit PlungeWestern Digital, based in San Jose, California, has seen its shares drop 51% in the past year, leaving it with a market value of about $10 billion. While its revenue for the quarter ended Sept. 30 fell to $3.7 billion from about $5.1 billion the previous year, its net income dived to $34 million from $636 million for the period.Kioxia, which was spun out of Toshiba in 2018, is the last remaining Japanese chipmaker capable of producing semiconductors on leading production technology. Japan has seen its lead in that vital field taken by South Korea and Taiwan. Toshiba itself is in take-private talks with a consortium led by Japan Industrial Partners Inc.Demand for memory chips has plummeted along with the cool down in their main markets: computing and smartphones. Publicly traded competitors such as Micron Technology Inc. and SK Hynix Inc. are facing steep sales declines in 2023 and may end up reporting losses, according to analysts’ projections.What Bloomberg Intelligence says:“This would create a company with meaningful scale in NAND flash memory and could structurally improve the broad NAND market.

That is because the Jan 20, 2023 $2.00 Call had some of the highest implied volatility of all equity options today.What is Implied Volatility?Implied volatility shows how much movement the market is expecting in the future. Options with high levels of implied volatility suggest that investors in the underlying stocks are expecting a big move in one direction or the other. It could also mean there is an event coming up soon that may cause a big rally or a huge sell-off. However, implied volatility is only one piece of the puzzle when putting together an options trading strategy.What do the Analysts Think?Clearly, options traders are pricing in a big move for Range Resources shares, but what is the fundamental picture for the company? Currently, Range Resources is a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) in the Oil and Gas - Exploration and Production - United States industry that ranks in the Bottom 42% of our Zacks Industry Rank. Over the last 30 days, two analysts have increased their earnings estimates for the current quarter, while one has dropped the estimates. The net effect has taken our Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current quarter from $1.20 per share to $1.21 in that period.Given the way analysts feel about Range Resources right now, this huge implied volatility could mean there’s a trade developing. Oftentimes, options traders look for options with high levels of implied volatility to sell premium. This is a strategy many seasoned traders use because it captures decay. At expiration, the hope for these traders is that the underlying stock does not move as much as originally expected.Looking to Trade Options?Check out the simple yet high-powered approach that Zacks Executive VP Kevin Matras has used to close recent double and triple-digit winners.

Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: Olympic Steel, Inc. ZEUS, Steel Dynamics, Inc. STLD, TimkenSteel Corporation TMST, Aperam S.A. APEMY and Nucor Corporation NUE.Here are highlights from Wednesday’s Analyst Blog:Nailing the Bright Spot in a Turbulent 2023Perhaps it would be wrong to say the bright spot. That would mean that it is the only one. And the Steel - Producers industry certainly isn’t the only one. All said and done, investors appear to be horribly pessimistic about the markets in general, which is a sure sign that there are plenty of cheap stocks to choose from.But the steel producers are a bit of an exception. Because they really have so much going for them this year. So much, in fact, that it’s even easy to ignore the uncertainties that a slower economy, deteriorating consumer spending and rising interest rates could bestow upon our markets. Even if the Fed gets to a 5.5% end-goal (more than what the market’s expecting now) and then sticks with that for a while, the negatives still couldn’t stand up to the positives we are seeing in this space.The first of these would be pent-up demand in the auto market, which is one of the primary consumers of the commodity. Steelmakers have been talking about it for a while now. Because of supply chain issues and the non-availability of semiconductors, demand from this market has been building up. Depending on which company you’re looking up, they are talking about a swelling order book at good pricing extending into the second half of the year. And now that the other issues have cleared up and there’s a huge drive to switch to EVs in the next few years, it’s safe to say that there’s several years of growth in the cards.Story continuesThe second factor is government regulations and initiatives, such as the CHIPS Act and the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, both of which are intended to onshore some strategically important manufacturing and increase government spending on public infrastructure. This will, of course, increase demand for steel. While this is a tailwind for several years, market watchers expect some of the spending to start kicking in this year.The energy crisis is nothing new. Ever since Russia went to war against Ukraine, the global energy markets have gone into a tailspin. The markets were already under pressure catering to pent up demand after the pandemic. With the West’s sanctions on Russia, one of the major energy players is set to move out of the market (effectively). Europe intends to stop using Russian energy at the earliest, but this requires the shifting of supply chains and therefore, significant investment in energy markets.It’s clear as day that clean energy won’t be up to speed with global demand in the next few years. Therefore, although backstopped by environmentalists and investors alike, energy companies are stepping up to add capacity. Which is so good for steelmakers.With that as a backdrop, one would expect this group to be trading at rich valuations.

That would mean that it is the only one. And the Steel - Producers industry certainly isn’t the only one. All said and done, investors appear to be horribly pessimistic about the markets in general, which is a sure sign that there are plenty of cheap stocks to choose from.But the steel producers are a bit of an exception. Because they really have so much going for them this year. So much, in fact, that it’s even easy to ignore the uncertainties that a slower economy, deteriorating consumer spending and rising interest rates could bestow upon our markets. Even if the Fed gets to a 5.5% end-goal (more than what the market’s expecting now) and then sticks with that for a while, the negatives still couldn’t stand up to the positives we are seeing in this space.The first of these would be pent-up demand in the auto market, which is one of the primary consumers of the commodity. Steelmakers have been talking about it for a while now. Because of supply chain issues and the non-availability of semiconductors, demand from this market has been building up. Depending on which company you’re looking up, they are talking about a swelling order book at good pricing extending into the second half of the year. And now that the other issues have cleared up and there’s a huge drive to switch to EVs in the next few years, it’s safe to say that there’s several years of growth in the cards.The second factor is government regulations and initiatives, such as the CHIPS Act and the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, both of which are intended to onshore some strategically important manufacturing and increase government spending on public infrastructure. This will, of course, increase demand for steel. While this is a tailwind for several years, market watchers expect some of the spending to start kicking in this year.The energy crisis is nothing new. Ever since Russia went to war against Ukraine, the global energy markets have gone into a tailspin. The markets were already under pressure catering to pent up demand after the pandemic. With the West’s sanctions on Russia, one of the major energy players is set to move out of the market (effectively). Europe intends to stop using Russian energy at the earliest, but this requires the shifting of supply chains and therefore, significant investment in energy markets.Story continuesIt’s clear as day that clean energy won’t be up to speed with global demand in the next few years. Therefore, although backstopped by environmentalists and investors alike, energy companies are stepping up to add capacity. Which is so good for steelmakers.With that as a backdrop, one would expect this group to be trading at rich valuations. But that is not the case as we see below-Olympic Steel, Inc.

25,fe51820c-8ac4-3b50-a621-791bbbd21094,TMO,2023-01-05,Here's Why Thermo Fisher Scientific (NYSE:TMO) Can Manage Its Debt Responsibly,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/heres-why-thermo-fisher-scientific-110017650.html,1672916417,STORY,['TMO'],"[Warren Buffett famously said, 'Volatility is far from synonymous with risk.' When we think about how risky a company is, we always like to look at its use of debt, since debt overload can lead to ruin. As with many other companies Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc. (NYSE:TMO) makes use of debt. But the more important question is: how much risk is that debt creating?Why Does Debt Bring Risk?Debt and other liabilities become risky for a business when it cannot easily fulfill those obligations, either with free cash flow or by raising capital at an attractive price. In the worst case scenario, a company can go bankrupt if it cannot pay its creditors. However, a more usual (but still expensive) situation is where a company must dilute shareholders at a cheap share price simply to get debt under control. Of course, debt can be an important tool in businesses, particularly capital heavy businesses. The first step when considering a company's debt levels is to consider its cash and debt together. View our latest analysis for Thermo Fisher Scientific What Is Thermo Fisher Scientific's Debt?The image below, which you can click on for greater detail, shows that at October 2022 Thermo Fisher Scientific had debt of US$28.9b, up from US$21.6b in one year. However, it also had US$2.92b in cash, and so its net debt is US$26.0b.debt-equity-history-analysisA Look At Thermo Fisher Scientific's LiabilitiesAccording to the last reported balance sheet, Thermo Fisher Scientific had liabilities of US$11.1b due within 12 months, and liabilities of US$35.7b due beyond 12 months. On the other hand, it had cash of US$2.92b and US$8.92b worth of receivables due within a year. So it has liabilities totalling US$35.0b more than its cash and near-term receivables, combined.Since publicly traded Thermo Fisher Scientific shares are worth a very impressive total of US$221.4b, it seems unlikely that this level of liabilities would be a major threat. But there are sufficient liabilities that we would certainly recommend shareholders continue to monitor the balance sheet, going forward.Story continuesWe measure a company's debt load relative to its earnings power by looking at its net debt divided by its earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) and by calculating how easily its earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) cover its interest expense (interest cover). Thus we consider debt relative to earnings both with and without depreciation and amortization expenses.Thermo Fisher Scientific's net debt to EBITDA ratio of about 2.1 suggests only moderate use of debt. And its commanding EBIT of 19.0 times its interest expense, implies the debt load is as light as a peacock feather. The bad news is that Thermo Fisher Scientific saw its EBIT decline by 14% over the last year. If that sort of decline is not arrested, then the managing its debt will be harder than selling broccoli flavoured ice-cream for a premium. When analysing debt levels, the balance sheet is the obvious place to start. But ultimately the future profitability of the business will decide if Thermo Fisher Scientific can strengthen its balance sheet over time. So if you're focused on the future you can check out this free report showing analyst profit forecasts.Finally, a company can only pay off debt with cold hard cash, not accounting profits. So the logical step is to look at the proportion of that EBIT that is matched by actual free cash flow. Over the most recent three years, Thermo Fisher Scientific recorded free cash flow worth 74% of its EBIT, which is around normal, given free cash flow excludes interest and tax. This cold hard cash means it can reduce its debt when it wants to.Our ViewThermo Fisher Scientific's interest cover was a real positive on this analysis, as was its conversion of EBIT to free cash flow. But truth be told its EBIT growth rate had us nibbling our nails. When we consider all the elements mentioned above, it seems to us that Thermo Fisher Scientific is managing its debt quite well. Having said that, the load is sufficiently heavy that we would recommend any shareholders keep a close eye on it. There's no doubt that we learn most about debt from the balance sheet. However, not all investment risk resides within the balance sheet - far from it.

CF is well-placed to benefit from rising nitrogen fertilizer demand in major markets and higher nitrogen prices amid headwinds from higher natural gas costs.The company’s shares have gained 18.8% in a year compared with the 3.9% rise of its industry.Let’s find out why this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock is worth retaining at the moment. Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchHigher Nitrogen Demand &amp; Prices Bode WellCF Industries is gaining from strong nitrogen fertilizer demand. Higher crop commodity prices are contributing to healthy demand globally. Industrial demand has also recovered from the pandemic-related disruptions. Higher industrial and economic activities and high levels of corn planted acres in the United States are likely to drive the demand for nitrogen.The company, on its third-quarter call, said that demand for nitrogen continues to be driven by the need to replenish global grains stocks. It expects high crop futures prices and healthy farm economics to support high corn and wheat planted acreage in 2023 in North America. India is also forecast to tender for urea to fully meet higher demand as farmers boost grain production.The company is also benefiting from higher nitrogen prices on the back of lower supply resulting from reduced operating rates globally due to higher energy prices. Higher nitrogen prices are driving its sales as witnessed in the last-reported quarter. The positive pricing environment is expected to continue moving ahead. Global nitrogen supply is expected to remain challenged due to higher energy prices and geopolitical factors.CF Industries also remains committed to boosting shareholders’ value by leveraging strong cash flows. Its net cash provided by operating activities was $990 million for the third quarter, up roughly 44% year over year. The company repurchased around 6.1 million shares for $532 million during the quarter. It also repurchased around 12.7 million shares for $1.12 billion during the first nine months of 2022. The company’s board has authorized a new $3 billion share repurchase program, which will commence upon completion of the existing share repurchase program and run through the end of 2025.Story continuesHigher Natural Gas Costs a ConcernThe company is facing headwinds from higher natural gas costs, stemming from an increase across Europe and Asia. The average cost of natural gas reflected in its cost of sales increased to $8.35 per million British thermal units (MMBtu) in the third quarter from $4.21 per MMBtu in the year-ago quarter. Gas costs are expected to remain elevated in Europe due to the uncertainties over the supply from Russia. High natural gas costs are expected to increase the company’s cost of sales in the fourth quarter.CF Industries Holdings, Inc. Price and Consensus CF Industries Holdings, Inc.

One way to achieve this is by employing the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model. Don't get put off by the jargon, the math behind it is actually quite straightforward.We would caution that there are many ways of valuing a company and, like the DCF, each technique has advantages and disadvantages in certain scenarios. If you still have some burning questions about this type of valuation, take a look at the Simply Wall St analysis model. View our latest analysis for Cintas The MethodWe are going to use a two-stage DCF model, which, as the name states, takes into account two stages of growth. The first stage is generally a higher growth period which levels off heading towards the terminal value, captured in the second 'steady growth' period. To begin with, we have to get estimates of the next ten years of cash flows. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.Generally we assume that a dollar today is more valuable than a dollar in the future, and so the sum of these future cash flows is then discounted to today's value:10-year free cash flow (FCF) estimate2023202420252026202720282029203020312032 Levered FCF ($, Millions) US$1.31bUS$1.55bUS$1.78bUS$1.94bUS$2.08bUS$2.19bUS$2.29bUS$2.38bUS$2.45bUS$2.52bGrowth Rate Estimate SourceAnalyst x6Analyst x6Analyst x1Est @ 9.24%Est @ 7.06%Est @ 5.54%Est @ 4.47%Est @ 3.72%Est @ 3.20%Est @ 2.83% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 7.1% US$1.2kUS$1.4kUS$1.4kUS$1.5kUS$1.5kUS$1.5kUS$1.4kUS$1.4kUS$1.3kUS$1.3k(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$14bStory continuesAfter calculating the present value of future cash flows in the initial 10-year period, we need to calculate the Terminal Value, which accounts for all future cash flows beyond the first stage. For a number of reasons a very conservative growth rate is used that cannot exceed that of a country's GDP growth. In this case we have used the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield (2.0%) to estimate future growth. In the same way as with the 10-year 'growth' period, we discount future cash flows to today's value, using a cost of equity of 7.1%.Terminal Value (TV)= FCF2032 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$2.5b× (1 + 2.0%) ÷ (7.1%– 2.0%) = US$51bPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$51b÷ ( 1 + 7.1%)10= US$26bThe total value is the sum of cash flows for the next ten years plus the discounted terminal value, which results in the Total Equity Value, which in this case is US$39b. In the final step we divide the equity value by the number of shares outstanding. Compared to the current share price of US$449, the company appears around fair value at the time of writing. Valuations are imprecise instruments though, rather like a telescope - move a few degrees and end up in a different galaxy. Do keep this in mind.dcfThe AssumptionsNow the most important inputs to a discounted cash flow are the discount rate, and of course, the actual cash flows. If you don't agree with these result, have a go at the calculation yourself and play with the assumptions. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Cintas as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 7.1%, which is based on a levered beta of 0.914. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.SWOT Analysis for CintasStrengthDebt is well covered by earnings and cashflows.Dividends are covered by earnings and cash flows.WeaknessEarnings growth over the past year underperformed the Commercial Services industry.Dividend is low compared to the top 25% of dividend payers in the Commercial Services market.Expensive based on P/E ratio and estimated fair value.OpportunityAnnual earnings are forecast to grow for the next 3 years.ThreatAnnual earnings are forecast to grow slower than the American market.Moving On:Valuation is only one side of the coin in terms of building your investment thesis, and it shouldn't be the only metric you look at when researching a company. DCF models are not the be-all and end-all of investment valuation. Instead the best use for a DCF model is to test certain assumptions and theories to see if they would lead to the company being undervalued or overvalued. If a company grows at a different rate, or if its cost of equity or risk free rate changes sharply, the output can look very different.

Typically, we'll want to notice a trend of growing return on capital employed (ROCE) and alongside that, an expanding base of capital employed. Put simply, these types of businesses are compounding machines, meaning they are continually reinvesting their earnings at ever-higher rates of return. With that in mind, the ROCE of Edwards Lifesciences (NYSE:EW) looks attractive right now, so lets see what the trend of returns can tell us.What Is Return On Capital Employed (ROCE)?If you haven't worked with ROCE before, it measures the 'return' (pre-tax profit) a company generates from capital employed in its business. To calculate this metric for Edwards Lifesciences, this is the formula:Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)0.22 = US$1.7b ÷ (US$8.6b - US$918m) (Based on the trailing twelve months to September 2022).Therefore, Edwards Lifesciences has an ROCE of 22%. In absolute terms that's a great return and it's even better than the Medical Equipment industry average of 11%. See our latest analysis for Edwards Lifesciences roceAbove you can see how the current ROCE for Edwards Lifesciences compares to its prior returns on capital, but there's only so much you can tell from the past. If you're interested, you can view the analysts predictions in our free report on analyst forecasts for the company.What Can We Tell From Edwards Lifesciences' ROCE Trend?We'd be pretty happy with returns on capital like Edwards Lifesciences. The company has employed 62% more capital in the last five years, and the returns on that capital have remained stable at 22%. With returns that high, it's great that the business can continually reinvest its money at such appealing rates of return. You'll see this when looking at well operated businesses or favorable business models.What We Can Learn From Edwards Lifesciences' ROCEIn the end, the company has proven it can reinvest it's capital at high rates of returns, which you'll remember is a trait of a multi-bagger. And the stock has followed suit returning a meaningful 88% to shareholders over the last five years. So while the positive underlying trends may be accounted for by investors, we still think this stock is worth looking into further.Story continuesWhile Edwards Lifesciences looks impressive, no company is worth an infinite price.

Newsbreak reported that the North Carolina Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services’ Standards Division collected fines from 70 Walmart stores in 38 counties due to pricing errors over the past year. The Charlotte Observer added that over the last year, the agency has seen about 26% of price scanner inspections fail. Overcharges of roughly 10% at Walmart were also found at locations in California’s Bay Area.Dollar General locations in Ohio that have been fined as a result of price scanning errors will display warning signs stuck to the side of store registers, Best Life detailed. The sign will read “WARNING NONSEALED SCANNER SYSTEM,” and instruct customers to “verify you have been charged correctly.” The sign also states that the scanner has not been officially approved by the Division of Weights and Measures.In a Dec. 13 press release from Ohio Franklin County Auditor Michael Stinziano — as reported by Best Life — Stinziano urged consumers to check prices and only pay the price listed on the store shelves.Jim and Cheryl Wilmington, two affected consumers in Topeka, Kansas, told 13 News that they wanted to spread the news about overcharging. They recommended dividing up your purchase by separating food items from non-food items and always checking the receipt.Some consumers were even charged for items they never purchased. In a viral TikTok video, user Julia Taylor said she noticed a charge of $19.86 for an item she didn’t purchase, per Best Life.

Employee Reveals 10 Standout Buys for Your MoneyFind: With a Recession Looming, Make These 3 Retirement Moves To Stay On TrackIn its 2022 National Retail Security Survey, the National Retail Federation (NRF) declared that non-sales product losses amount to almost $100 billion in the industry.Although retail management has identified several types of shrinkage — such as internal/employee theft, operational loss, administrative errors and return fraud — it is organized retail crime (ORC) that accounts for a large part of the problem. This grander, more coordinated type of shoplifting has industry leaders taking tougher security stances and paying plenty for them.When speaking to Forbes in November 2022, the National Retail Federation’s (NRF) Mark Mathews emphasized that the problem is more than an uptick in random shoplifting. “The kind of theft that’s mostly happening isn’t run-of-the-mill shoplifting. It’s organized crime,” said Mathews.As Best Life reported, companies have seen ORC numbers climb steadily over the past three years. Talking about the problem on CNBC’s “Squawk Box,” Walmart CEO Doug McMillon said, “Theft is an issue. It’s higher than what it has historically been.”Explaining these “more sophisticated and highly dangerous” crimes to a Senate hearing in Nov. 2021, CVS Health crime and corporate investigations exec Brendan (Ben) Dugan told the committee judiciary that his company has seen ORC increase 300% since the start of the pandemic. Dugan indicated those thefts had resulted in annual losses of more than $200 million for his company.And in a company call to investors in Jan. 2022, Walgreens CFO James Kehoe claimed his company’s retail shrink rose 40% to 50% “over the last two years” — and was then currently “absorbing a 52% increase in shrink,” per Best Life.Story continuesRetailers Lock Up Product In Response to Increased TheftMore locked product cases and additional security gear have been implemented by Walmart, CVS, Walgreens and others in an attempt to thwart criminals from stealing large quantities of goods and reselling them for profit.Having to access items from locked displays is causing an inconvenience for shoppers, who have taken to social media to complain about the increasingly unacceptable customer service at stores that are understaffed and underperforming.NRF’s vice president of asset protection and retail operations, David Johnston, admitted that the rise in lock-and-key measures is “probably not great for the customer experience,” but tightened security actions aren’t ideal for companies, either.Although Joe Budano told Slate that the security devices his company, Indyme, sells to Walgreens and others are “a solution of last resort,” he also said they are an unfortunate requirement for companies trying to combat ORC. In a separate interview with Forbes, Budano suggested that merchandising lock-ups cost stores between 15% and 25% in sales.Describing the type of individual complicit in retail ORC, Kehoe said: “It’s not somebody who can’t afford to eat tomorrow… These are gangs that actually go in and empty our stores of beauty products. And it’s a real issue.”Take Our Poll: What Do You Plan To Use Your Tax Refund For?More: 10 Aldi Brand Products Worth BuyingIf the issue grows into a widespread departure of bothered and scared shoppers from stores, retailers will have to come up with more consumer-friendly strategies to battle this level of theft.

The Federal Reserve raised the benchmark federal funds rate seven times last year to the highest level in 15 years to mitigate inflationary pressures. The S&amp;P United States REIT index plunged 27% in 2022. The benchmark S&amp;P 500 index, in comparison, is down 19.4% over the past year.The recessionary concerns have also battered real estate investment trusts (REITs), as demand for specific real estate properties such as housing and commercial office properties plummeted. After a stellar run in 2021, housing demand plunged by 30% in November last year. The permanent shift toward a remote working culture along with mass layoffs also harmed commercial office properties.As the inflation levels are still well above the Fed’s target of 2%, the central bank is expected to stick to its hawkish monetary policies.“There’s an expectation really that the services inflation will not move down so quickly, so we’ll have to stay at it,” Fed Chairman Jerome Powell said. “We may have to raise rates higher to get where we want to go.”Some of the hardest-hit REITs are:AvalonBay CommunitiesAvalonBay Communities Inc. (NYSE: AVB) is a residential REIT that owns 88,405 apartments across 12 states. It won the Nareit 2022 Leader in the Light Award, reflecting its superior environmental, social and governance (ESG) efforts.But shares of AvalonBay Communities declined 36.1% in 2022. Several analysts downgraded the stock anticipating underperformance amid the Fed’s continued hawkish stance and normalizing rental rates.Last month, Aperture Investors analyst Adam Kramer downgraded AVB stock from Overweight to Equal-Weight, while Goldman Sach analyst Chandi Luthra downgraded the stock from Buy to Neutral. Also, JP Morgan analysts downgraded AvalonBay Communities from Neutral to Underweight on Dec. 16. This comes after the REIT revised its fiscal 2022 core funds from operations (FFO) per share guidance from $9.76$9.96 to $9.74-$9.84.Story continuesAvalonBay Communities pays $6.36 per share as dividends annually, yielding 3.94%. Its four-year average dividend yield stands at 3.23%. Over the past five years, the REIT’s dividend payouts grew at a meager 2.3% compound annual growth rate (CAGR).Equity ResidentialShares of Chigaco-based Equity Residential (NYSE: EQR) declined 34.8% over the past year, given the tremendous macroeconomic turbulence. Equity Residential’s financials have taken a hit in recent quarters. In the third quarter that ended on Sept. 30, the REIT’s earnings per share (EPS) fell 25.2% year-over-year to $0.86.Equity Residential’s normalized FFO per share increased 19.5% year-over-year from $0.77 in the third quarter of 2021 to $0.92 in the third quarter of last year. The REIT pays $2.50 in dividends annually, translating to a 4.24% yield. Equity Residential raised its annual dividend payout by 9 cents, or 3.73%, from $2.41 in 2021 to $2.50 last year.Despite the softening rental rates, the REIT’s management has remained bullish regarding its 2023 growth prospects.“The substantial embedded growth in our rent roll and our financially resilient and highly employable resident base leaves us well-positioned to deliver above-average results in 2023 — despite likely macroeconomic turbulence. Longer term, we will continue to benefit from trends such as high single-family housing costs, favorable demographics and an overall deficit in housing across the country,” Equity Residential President and CEO Mark Parrell said.SL Green RealtyManhattan, New York’s largest commercial landlord, SL Green Realty Corp. (NYSE: SLG), has had a dismal year. SL Green stock plummeted 54.4% last year, making it one of the worst-performing office REITs in 2022. Analysts have also maintained a bearish sentiment regarding SL Green Realty. In December, SL Green stock was downgraded by BMO Capital Markets analyst John Kim, Scotiabank analyst Nicholas Yulico and Citigroup analyst Nicholas Joseph.The commercial REIT has been battered by the declining demand for office space over the past two years. For the nine months ended Sept. 30, SL Green Realty reported a net loss of $28.7 million, or 47 cents per share. This compares with the $486.1 million net income generated over the same period of 2021. The REIT slashed its dividend per share by 12.9% to $0.3108 last month. It pays $3.25 in dividends annually, translating to a 9.64% yield.As recession concerns loom, the possibility of speedy revival is slim for New York City’s largest landlord. The consensus FFO estimate of $5.72 for fiscal 2023 indicates a 14.1% decline year-over-year. Analysts expect the REIT’s revenue to improve by 2.4% in this year.Weekly REIT Report: REITs are one of the most misunderstood investment options, making it difficult for investors to spot incredible opportunities until it’s too late.

SWK has failed to impress investors with its recent operational performance due to weakness in its Tools &amp; Outdoor segment, persistent supply-chain constraints, raw material cost inflation and foreign-currency headwinds. These factors may adversely impede its earnings in the near term.Let’s discuss the factors that might continue taking a toll on the firm.Weak Segmental Performance: Softness in the Tools &amp; Outdoor segment due to reduced retail and consumer demand is weighing on Stanley Black’s performance. The segment is witnessing lower volumes due to reduced consumer spending as a result of hiked interest rates and a spike in fuel prices. The company anticipates the segment’s organic revenues to decline by mid-to-high-single digits in 2022.Steep Costs and Expenses: Cost inflation poses a threat to Stanley Black’s bottom line. In the first nine months of 2022, SWK’s cost of sales, and selling, general and administrative expenses jumped 28.6% and 15.6%, respectively, year over year. Supply chain disruptions are added concerns for the company, which are weighing on margins and profitability.Forex Woes: Given the company’s vast international presence, it is exposed to currency translation risks. Forex woes hampered Stanley Black’s sales by 4% on a year-over-year basis in the third quarter 2022.

47,f5d0d303-1132-3a39-b584-e99688002c78,HBAN,2023-01-05,Will Huntington Bancshares (HBAN) Beat Estimates Again in Its Next Earnings Report?,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/huntington-bancshares-hban-beat-estimates-171005595.html,1672852205,STORY,['HBAN'],"[If you are looking for a stock that has a solid history of beating earnings estimates and is in a good position to maintain the trend in its next quarterly report, you should consider Huntington Bancshares (HBAN). This company, which is in the Zacks Banks - Midwest industry, shows potential for another earnings beat.This regional bank holding company has seen a nice streak of beating earnings estimates, especially when looking at the previous two reports. The average surprise for the last two quarters was 4.26%.For the last reported quarter, Huntington Bancshares came out with earnings of $0.39 per share versus the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $0.38 per share, representing a surprise of 2.63%. For the previous quarter, the company was expected to post earnings of $0.34 per share and it actually produced earnings of $0.36 per share, delivering a surprise of 5.88%.Price and EPS SurpriseWith this earnings history in mind, recent estimates have been moving higher for Huntington Bancshares. In fact, the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) for the company is positive, which is a great sign of an earnings beat, especially when you combine this metric with its nice Zacks Rank.Our research shows that stocks with the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time. In other words, if you have 10 stocks with this combination, the number of stocks that beat the consensus estimate could be as high as seven.The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is related to change. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Story continuesHuntington Bancshares has an Earnings ESP of +3.89% at the moment, suggesting that analysts have grown bullish on its near-term earnings potential. When you combine this positive Earnings ESP with the stock's Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), it shows that another beat is possibly around the corner. The company's next earnings report is expected to be released on January 20, 2023.Investors should note, however, that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss, but a negative value does reduce the predictive power of this metric.Many companies end up beating the consensus EPS estimate, but that may not be the sole basis for their stocks moving higher. On the other hand, some stocks may hold their ground even if they end up missing the consensus estimate.Because of this, it's really important to check a company's Earnings ESP ahead of its quarterly release to increase the odds of success.

(UBSFY) and MGM Resorts (MGM). But which of these two stocks presents investors with the better value opportunity right now? Let's take a closer look.The best way to find great value stocks is to pair a strong Zacks Rank with an impressive grade in the Value category of our Style Scores system. The proven Zacks Rank emphasizes companies with positive estimate revision trends, and our Style Scores highlight stocks with specific traits.Right now, UbiSoft Entertainment Inc. is sporting a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy), while MGM Resorts has a Zacks Rank of #5 (Strong Sell). Investors should feel comfortable knowing that UBSFY likely has seen a stronger improvement to its earnings outlook than MGM has recently. But this is just one piece of the puzzle for value investors.Value investors are also interested in a number of tried-and-true valuation metrics that help show when a company is undervalued at its current share price levels.Our Value category grades stocks based on a number of key metrics, including the tried-and-true P/E ratio, the P/S ratio, earnings yield, and cash flow per share, as well as a variety of other fundamentals that value investors frequently use.UBSFY currently has a forward P/E ratio of 13.94, while MGM has a forward P/E of 138.67. We also note that UBSFY has a PEG ratio of 1.75. This figure is similar to the commonly-used P/E ratio, with the PEG ratio also factoring in a company's expected earnings growth rate. MGM currently has a PEG ratio of 7.89.Another notable valuation metric for UBSFY is its P/B ratio of 1.97. The P/B is a method of comparing a stock's market value to its book value, which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities. By comparison, MGM has a P/B of 2.25.These metrics, and several others, help UBSFY earn a Value grade of A, while MGM has been given a Value grade of C.Story continuesUBSFY has seen stronger estimate revision activity and sports more attractive valuation metrics than MGM, so it seems like value investors will conclude that UBSFY is the superior option right now.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

49,cde8d24e-de08-33f6-95f9-122b205fc764,MGM,2023-01-05,5 Toxic Stocks That Can Set Off Alarm Bells for Your Portfolio,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/5-toxic-stocks-set-off-120612734.html,1672833972,STORY,"['OMCL', 'RDNT', 'MGM']","[Successful investing calls for the appropriate identification of overpriced stocks and correctly priced stocks. However, in practice, overhyped toxic stocks and fairly priced stocks are intermixed in the marketplace in such a way that it becomes difficult to distinguish between them. Investors who can correctly spot overpriced stocks and shun them at the right time are the ones likely to make a profit.Usually, toxic stocks are fraught with huge debt loads and susceptible to external shocks. Also, the unjustifiably high price of toxic stocks is short-lived as the intrinsic value of these stocks is less than their current price. Quite naturally, if you own such toxic stocks for a long period of time, you are sure to incur a huge loss of wealth.MGM Resorts International MGM, Illumina Inc ILMN, Omnicell, Inc. OMCL, Hecla Mining HL and RadNet, Inc. RDNT are a few such toxic stocks.The higher price of the toxic stocks can be attributed to either an irrational exuberance associated with them or some serious fundamental lacuna associated with them. If you own such stocks for long, you are likely to see a big loss in your wealth.On the other hand, if you can accurately pinpoint the toxic stocks, you are likely to gain by resorting to an investing strategy called short selling. This strategy allows you to sell a stock first and then buy it when the price falls.While short selling excels in bear markets, it typically loses money in bull markets.So, just like picking up stocks with strong growth potential, pinpointing toxic stocks and abandoning them at the right time is the key to protect your portfolio from big losses or make profits by short selling them.Screening CriteriaHere is a winning strategy that will help you to identify overpriced toxic stocks:Most recent Debt/Equity Ratio greater than the median industry average: High debt/equity ratio implies high leverage. High leverage indicates a huge level of repayment that the company has to make in connection with the debt amount.Story continuesP/E using 12-month forward EPS estimate greater than 50: A very high forward P/E implies that a stock is highly overvalued.% Change in F (1) and F (2) Estimate (12 Weeks) less than -5: Negative EPS estimate revision for this fiscal year and the next during the past 12 weeks points to analysts’ pessimism.Zacks Rank more than #3 (Hold): We have not considered Buy/Hold-rated stocks that generally outperform or are in line with the market. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Stocks to DiscardHere are five of the 23 toxic stocks that showed up on the screen:MGM Resorts is a holding company and primarily owns and operates casino resorts through wholly owned subsidiaries. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company’s 2023 earnings implies a decline of 81.1% year over year. The consensus mark for 2022 EPS has been revised downward by 62.2% in the past 90 days. MGM Resorts missed earnings estimates in two out of the last four quarters for as many beats, with the average negative surprise being 52%. The company carries a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) and has a VGM Score of C.Illumina is a life sciences company that provides tools and integrated systems for the analysis of genetic variation and function. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Illumina’s 2022 earnings per share implies a year-over-year decline of 59%. The consensus mark for 2023 EPS has moved south by 40 cents over the past 60 days. Estimates for ILMN’s 2022 earnings have also moved south by 32 cents per share over the same time frame.

Estimates for OMCL’s 2023 earnings have also moved south by 32 cents per share over the past 30 days. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company’s 2023 earnings per share implies a year-over-year decline of 26%.

The two 1700 V avalanche-rated EliteSiC Schottky diodes will help designers achieve stable high-voltage operation at high temperatures.ON has forayed into building these products to capitalize on the uptrend in the market for energy infrastructure.onsemi has a well-diversified business and is addressing other megatrends such as factory automation and electric vehicles. The company generates a significant percentage of revenues from each of the computing, consumer, industrial, communications and automotive markets. onsemi reported revenues of $2.19 billion in the third quarter of 2022, which beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 3.6% and improved 26% on a year-over-year basis.The company is reallocating capacity to strategic and high-margin products to drive a favorable mix shift and eliminate price-to-value discrepancies. To do so, onsemi is expanding its production capacity in strategic locations and closing fab locations in areas that are affecting its margin growth due to rising price surges in operating in those areas.ON Semiconductor Corporation Price and Consensus ON Semiconductor Corporation Price and ConsensusON Semiconductor Corporation price-consensus-chart | ON Semiconductor Corporation Quoteonsemi Boosting SiC Manufacturing Capacity to Drive Top LineThe entire Semiconductor - Analog and Mixed industry is reeling under various operational challenges due to a number of macroeconomic turmoils like raging inflation, the ongoing Russia-Ukraine war, forex market volatility and the looming recession. These can impact the performance capabilities and bottom-line growth of companies like onsemi, which has a significant debt burden.Story continuesAs of Sep 30, 2022, onsemi had a cash balance of $2.45 billion, whereas total debt (including the current portion) was $3.21 billion. A high debt position increases the risk profile of the business. Thus, the company is required to constantly generate an adequate amount of cash flows to meet debt requirements. Onsemi currently carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.However, despite its leveraged balance sheet, onsemi has been expanding its SiC facilities domestically and internationally to diversify its product portfolio. Per onsemi, the SiC total addressable market is projected to grow from $2 billion in 2021 to $6.5 billion in 2026, witnessing a CAGR of 33%.The company recently expanded its Hudson, NH-based facility, which will increase SiC boule production capacity by five times year over year. This will aid in meeting the rising demand for SiC-based solutions, which is critical for developing EVs and energy infrastructure, and is an important contributor to decarbonization.ON recently expanded its SiC facility in Roznov, Czech Republic, to expand SiC production capacity by 16 times. So far, ON has invested more than $150 million in the Roznov site and will look to spend an additional $300 million through 2023.onsemi, is not only expanding its production capacity. The company has recently completed the sale of its Niigata, Japan facility, which aligns with its fab liter strategy to expand the gross margin and reduce its fixed-cost footprint.Also, positively impacting the domestic expansion of onsemi’s SiC facilities is President Biden's decision to sign the CHIPS and Science Act. The act supports investments in domestic semiconductor manufacturing, and reducing dependence on foreign markets like China and Japan. Its peer Microchip Technology MCHP is also looking to benefit from the recent declaration of the act by the government.The government's recent declaration will help Microchip to diversify income from its microcontroller business, which is riddled with supply-chain disturbances. Microchip continues developing, and introducing a wide range of innovative and proprietary new linear, mixed-signal, power, interface and timing products to spur growth in the analog business.However, ON is facing stiff competition from Texas Instruments TXN and STMicroelectronics STM.STMicroelectronics’ third-generation STPOWER SiC MOSFETs help meet the energy-saving efficiency requirements in EVs and are chief competitors of onsemi in the EV market. STMicroelectronics’ solutions will help EV makers achieve faster charging and reduce EV weight, helping STM win a significant market share in the industry.Texas Instruments is also seeing success in certain fast-growing automotive market segments. TXN is focused on infotainment, safety and ADAS, body electronics (including lighting), hybrid electric vehicles and powertrain segments of the automotive market. It also experiences significant traction from the EV megatrend.onsemi, however, signed long-term supply agreements with various customers for the next three years, which are expected to help secure $1 billion of committed SiC revenues in 2023.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude settled up 83 cents, or 1.2%, at $73.67 a barrel.Both benchmarks' cumulative declines of more than 9% on Tuesday and Wednesday were the biggest two-day losses at the start of a year since 1991, according to Refinitiv Eikon data.Supporting prices earlier in the session was a statement from top U.S. pipeline operator Colonial Pipeline, which said its Line 3 had been shut for unscheduled maintenance with a restart expected for the products line on Jan. 7.Tamas Varga of oil broker PVM said the price rebound early in the session was due to the pipeline shutdown and added: ""There is no doubt that the prevailing trend is down; it is a bear market.""Reflecting near-term bearishness, the nearby contracts of the two benchmarks traded at a discount to the next month, a structure known as contango.On Wednesday, figures showing U.S. manufacturing contracted further in December pressured prices, as did concerns about economic disruption as COVID-19 works its way through China, which has abruptly dropped strict curbs on travel and activity.(Reporting by Stephanie Kelly; Additional reporting by Alex Lawler and Jeslyn Lerh; Editing by Marguerita Choy, David Evans, Diane Craft and David Gregorio)]"
61,51cdad5d-ad39-312f-a2ef-db70a0f2670f,FE,2023-01-05,U.S. natgas futures drop 5% to 10-month low ahead of storage report,Reuters,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/u-natgas-futures-drop-5-125525440.html,1672923325,STORY,['NG=F'],"[Jan 5 (Reuters) - U.S. natural gas futures dropped about 5% to a 10-month low on Thursday on forecasts for warmer-than-normal weather to continue into late January. That should keep heating demand low during what is usually the coldest part of the year and allow utilities to pull less gas from storage than usual in coming weeks. Thursday's price drop came ahead of a federal report expected to show last week's storage withdrawal was much bigger-than-usual because the weather then was still colder-than-normal, prompting consumers to burn lots of gas to heat their homes and businesses. Analysts forecast U.S. utilities pulled 228 billion cubic feet (bcf) of gas from storage during the week ended Dec. 30. That compares with a decrease of 46 bcf in the same week last year and a five-year (2017-2021) average decline of 98 bcf. If correct, last week's decrease would cut stockpiles to 2.884 trillion cubic feet (tcf), or 6.9% below the five-year average of 3.099 tcf for this time of year. Traders said the market's biggest uncertainty remains when Freeport LNG will restart its liquefied natural gas (LNG) export plant in Texas. After several delays from October to November and then to December, Freeport now expects the facility to return in the second half of January, pending regulatory approvals. That is in line with what many analysts have long been saying - that Freeport would likely return during the first quarter of 2023 because the company still has a lot of work to do to satisfy federal regulators before restarting the plant. Whenever Freeport returns, U.S. demand for gas will jump. The plant can turn about 2.1 billion cubic feet per day (bcfd) of gas into LNG, which is about 2% of U.S. daily production. Freeport shut on June 8 after a pipe failure caused an explosion due to inadequate operating and testing procedures, and human error and fatigue, according to a report by consultants hired to review the incident and suggest corrective actions. Several vessels, including Prism Diversity, Prism Courage, Prism Agility and Elisa Larus, have been waiting in the Gulf of Mexico to pick up LNG from Freeport, some since early November. Other ships were sailing toward the plant, including Corcovado LNG, which is expected to arrive in mid-January, and Kmarin Diamond and Wilforce expected in late January. After jumping about 5% on Wednesday, front-month gas futures on Thursday fell 20.8 cents, or 5.0%, to $3.964 per million British thermal units (mmBtu) at 8:00 a.m. EST (1300 GMT), putting the contract on track for its lowest close since Feb. 11 for a second time this week. It also closed at its lowest since Feb. 11 on Tuesday. That keeps the front-month in technically oversold territory with a relative strength index (RSI) below 30 for a sixth day in a row for the first time since October. Data provider Refinitiv said average gas output in the U.S. Lower 48 states rose to 98.3 bcfd so far in January, up from 96.7 bcfd in December but still below the monthly record of 99.9 bcfd in November 2022. Even though the weather is expected to remain warmer-than-normal through late-January, Refinitiv projected average U.S. gas demand, including exports, would jump from 110.4 bcfd this week to 121.6 bcfd next week as temperatures ease ahead of what are usually the coldest weeks of the year. Those demand forecasts were similar to Refinitiv's outlook on Wednesday. The average amount of gas flowing to U.S. LNG export plants slid to 11.8 bcfd so far in January, down from 11.9 bcfd in December. That compares with a monthly record of 12.9 bcfd in March. The seven big U.S. export plants, including Freeport, can turn about 13.8 bcfd of gas into LNG.

On Friday, January 7, 2022, in Edmonton, Alberta, Canada. (Photo by Artur Widak/NurPhoto via Getty Images)At the moment, big-cap tech companies are executing on the first aspect to Meeks' investment thesis, the one most within their control, which is cost slashing to bolster sagging profits.Salesforce said Wednesday morning it would cut 10% of its workforce — which would comprise roughly 7,000 employees — and execute select real estate exits and office space reductions. The company declined to comment to Yahoo Finance on what real estate it would be exiting or offices it would be reducing.The company estimates it will incur $1.4 billion to $2.1 billion in charges related to the actions.""I’ve been thinking a lot about how we came to this moment,"" Salesforce co-founder and CEO Marc Benioff said in a letter to employees. ""As our revenue accelerated through the pandemic, we hired too many people leading into this economic downturn we’re now facing, and I take responsibility for that.""Story continuesInvestors embraced the money-saving news — shares finished the session up 3.5%.Amazon joined Salesforce on Wednesday night in revealing 18,000 job cuts, mostly in corporate functions. An Amazon spokesperson didn't return Yahoo Finance's request for comment on the amount of charges the company would incur as a result of the maneuvers.""Amazon has weathered uncertain and difficult economies in the past, and we will continue to do so,"" Amazon CEO Andy Jassy wrote in a letter to employees. ""These changes will help us pursue our long-term opportunities with a stronger cost structure; however, I’m also optimistic that we’ll be inventive, resourceful, and scrappy in this time when we’re not hiring expansively and eliminating some roles. Companies that last a long time go through different phases. They’re not in heavy people expansion mode every year.""In a similar vein to Salesforce, Amazon shares popped in premarket trading on Thursday as traders positioned for potential better profits later this year.Others in tech have also found that come-to-Jesus moment on costs in recent months as investors press for better margins with sales growth cooling and stock prices languishing.Snap (SNAP) canned 20% of its workforce in August, and Robinhood (HOOD) cut ties with 23% of its employee base the same month. In November, Meta said it would cut 11,000 workers after another soft quarter. Twitter CEO Elon Musk moved swiftly to cut 3,700 Twitter employees in November upon the closure of his deal for the social media platform.Meeks estimates the tech industry cut an estimated 300,000 jobs in 2022 alone. Furthermore, Meeks thinks the likes of Amazon, Salesforce and others aren't done yet on cost-cutting to appease Wall Street.""I think we will see more layoffs,"" Meeks said, adding that ""these companies have probably gotten fat over the years, so I expect continued trimming.""Brian Sozzi is an editor-at-large and anchor at Yahoo Finance.

The software company cutting around 8,000 jobs, or 10%, in the latest head count cut in the tech sector. Said CEO Marc Benioff, quote, ""the environment remains challenging and our customers are taking a more measured approach to their purchasing decisions.""Salesforce, like many tech companies, boomed during the pandemic with people hunkering down at home. With the soaring revenues came similar headcount, growing from about 48,000 to just under 80,000 at the end of October. That's an increase of more than 30%, Seana. It is not the beginning of tech layoffs, it appears to be far from the end.SEANA SMITH: It certainly does. And I thought it was interesting-- Benioff really just taking responsibility for this-- for the fact that Salesforce grew way too quickly. He wrote part in that letter that you just wrote that we hired too many people leading into this economic downturn we are facing, and I take responsibility for that.And I think this is largely reflective of the trends that we're seeing more broadly throughout the industry rather than this being a Salesforce-specific issue. Because when you take into account the fact that clients have been starting to scale back some of their spending, a lot of that being done in the enterprise space, which clearly affects Salesforce and more reflective of the softening that we're seeing, more so in the landscape rather than Salesforce losing some of that ground or losing market share to some of its competitors.The stock, Dave, has been hammered over the past year-- shares off nearly 50%. I think many on the Street were maybe not expecting, but weren't necessarily going to be surprised if Salesforce was, in fact, forced to lay off people given the fact that they scaled so quickly, but that 10% number might have been a little bit higher than what some analysts were initially expecting to see.Story continuesDAVE BRIGGS: I think it most similarly follows the Amazon story in that another tech company that just really overbuilt during the pandemic and had to cut back under Andy Jassy-- a little different than the Meta story, which invested too heavily in, of course, the metaverse. If there's any sprinkling of good news-- five months of severance and benefits for those employees.And a ZipRecruiter survey recently found that 79% of tech employees who were laid off found a new job in the next three months. Now, the question is, Seana-- and I think the question that Jay Powell is asking is, are those new jobs going to be at the same salary or lower and bring down inflation increases? That's what he needs-- the wage inflation to begin to come down.SEANA SMITH: Well, at least at this point, it seems like the employee still has the upper hand-- obviously, it varies from industry to industry. But as these layoffs tend to increase, or if it keeps on the trend that we have been seeing, the employer will have the upper hand and maybe we will see salaries begin to come down a bit. And, simply, people aren't able to negotiate, maybe, for the salary that they want at their next job.]"

(NYSE: NRGV) (""Energy Vault"" or the ""Company""), a leader in sustainable grid-scale energy storage solutions, and Pacific Gas and Electric Company (PG&amp;E), a subsidiary of PG&amp;E Corporation (NYSE: PCG), today announced the companies are partnering to deploy and operate a utility-scale battery plus green hydrogen long-duration energy storage system (BH-ESS) with a minimum of 293 megawatt-hours (MWh) of dispatchable carbon-free energy.This press release features multimedia. View the full release here: https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20230105005452/en/The BH-ESS is designed to power downtown and the surrounding area of the Northern California City of Calistoga for a minimum of 48 hours during planned outages and potential Public Safety Power Shutoffs (PSPS), which is when the powerlines serving the surrounding area must be turned off for safety due to high wildfire risk.PG&amp;E submitted the project contract for review and approval to the California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC) on December 30, 2022, with a request for the issuance of a final resolution approving the project by May 15, 2023. The energy storage system will be owned, operated and maintained by Energy Vault while providing dispatchable power under a long-term tolling agreement with PG&amp;E. The system’s capacity may be expanded to 700MWh, which would allow it to operate for longer without refueling, enabling further flexibility for PG&amp;E and the City of Calistoga.Story continuesEnergy Vault’s BH-ESS will replace the typical, mobile diesel generators used to energize PG&amp;E’s Calistoga microgrid during broader grid outages. The project represents a major advance in community-scale microgrid development and a significant step toward realizing the CPUC’s vision of cleaner forms of microgrid generation.""PG&amp;E selected Energy Vault’s innovative hybrid architecture and design to create a cost-effective, community-scale, fully carbon-free microgrid that can store and dispatch on-demand renewable energy,"" said Ron Richardson, Regional Vice President, North Bay and North Coast, PG&amp;E. ""This breakthrough collaboration between PG&amp;E and Energy Vault provides a template for future, renewable community-scale microgrids that successfully integrate third-party distributed energy resources, which is expected to cost customers less than the benchmark set by state regulators based on the alternative use of mobile diesel generators.""The system is anticipated to provide carbon-free energy for the Calistoga community of more than 2,000 electric customers for a period of 48 hours with a hybrid architecture that will allow for grid forming and black start capabilities, with the potential to further expand the project’s capacity in the future up to 700MWh.Construction is anticipated to begin in the fourth quarter of 2023 with commercial operation expected by the end of second quarter of 2024. Upon completion, this project is expected to be the first-of-its-kind and the largest utility-scale green hydrogen project in the United States.""We’re excited to partner with PG&amp;E on this groundbreaking project that reflects Energy Vault’s differentiated ability to design, build and operate innovative and utility-scale energy storage solutions that meet our customers’ specific needs in achieving their grid reliability and decarbonization goals,"" said Robert Piconi, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Energy Vault. ""We are setting a new benchmark for what can be achieved with an innovative design that integrates the most advanced energy storage mediums in order to deliver a fully renewable green hydrogen battery energy storage system. We look forward to delivering this world-class resiliency system for the City of Calistoga, which has been an excellent partner throughout the evaluation and operational review process. Our engineers designed this innovative hybrid energy storage system leveraging Energy Vault’s technology-neutral integration platform and energy management software. This project represents another key customer validation of our strategy and our unmatched, industry-leading ability to bring the most innovative short, long and ultra-long duration energy storage technologies to our customers with proprietary gravity, green hydrogen and hybrid battery solutions as we deliver on our mission of enabling a renewable world.""About the Technology, How it Works, and Next stepsUnder the 10.5-year agreement, Energy Vault will provide ""Distributed Generation-Enabled Microgrid Services"" – a type of energy service that involves using grid-forming generation and storage resources, potentially in combination with demand-side resources, to provide energy, fault current contribution and to regulate voltage and frequency within the utility’s established parameters to enable the islanding of the Calistoga microgrid during planned outages.A hydrogen fuel cell will be powered by electrolytic hydrogen derived from renewable energy sources. The hybrid generation/storage facility will not emit localized pollutants such as oxides of nitrogen and particulate matter when generating electricity to power the microgrid. Green hydrogen, also called renewable hydrogen, is produced through the electrolysis of water. This process is powered entirely by renewable energy, so it generates no polluting emissions into the atmosphere and is the cleanest and most sustainable hydrogen. The community-scale microgrid will be 100% renewable.The solution is designed to operate during planned outages and PSPS events, serving all the load within a safe-to-energize area in the City of Calistoga, including critical facilities such as fire and police stations, and shared services in the downtown and surrounding area.Energy Vault’s proprietary Energy Management System will provide full system control and optimal dispatching across the multi-medium aspect of the project, including batteries, hydrogen tanks and fuel-cells.PG&amp;E will use and upgrade its existing distribution infrastructure to establish the microgrid.The entire system will be developed on less than one acre of land and is expected to serve as a model for Energy Vault’s future utility-scale hybrid storage system deployments.Given the groundbreaking nature of the technology, PG&amp;E and Energy Vault undertook extensive safety and operational studies and also consulted with local stakeholders in advance of finalizing the agreement, including the City of Calistoga and Marin Clean Energy, a Community Choice Aggregator that is the default retail seller of electricity in the area.The City of Calistoga supported the project through the issuance of a letter of intent to allow City property to be leased to Energy Vault in order to site the storage and dispatching resources.For more information, read PG&amp;E’s advice letter requesting approval of the project.About PG&amp;EPG&amp;E, a subsidiary of PG&amp;E Corporation (NYSE:PCG), is a combined natural gas and electric utility serving more than 16 million people across 70,000 square miles in Northern and Central California.

Amongst other things, we'll want to see two things; firstly, a growing return on capital employed (ROCE) and secondly, an expansion in the company's amount of capital employed. This shows us that it's a compounding machine, able to continually reinvest its earnings back into the business and generate higher returns. Although, when we looked at Align Technology (NASDAQ:ALGN), it didn't seem to tick all of these boxes.Understanding Return On Capital Employed (ROCE)For those who don't know, ROCE is a measure of a company's yearly pre-tax profit (its return), relative to the capital employed in the business. To calculate this metric for Align Technology, this is the formula:Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)0.18 = US$751m ÷ (US$5.9b - US$1.8b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to September 2022).So, Align Technology has an ROCE of 18%.  On its own, that's a standard return, however it's much better than the 11% generated by the Medical Equipment industry. View our latest analysis for Align Technology roceAbove you can see how the current ROCE for Align Technology compares to its prior returns on capital, but there's only so much you can tell from the past. If you'd like to see what analysts are forecasting going forward, you should check out our free report for Align Technology.What Can We Tell From Align Technology's ROCE Trend?In terms of Align Technology's historical ROCE movements, the trend isn't fantastic. Over the last five years, returns on capital have decreased to 18% from 25% five years ago. Meanwhile, the business is utilizing more capital but this hasn't moved the needle much in terms of sales in the past 12 months, so this could reflect longer term investments. It may take some time before the company starts to see any change in earnings from these investments.Story continuesThe Bottom LineBringing it all together, while we're somewhat encouraged by Align Technology's reinvestment in its own business, we're aware that returns are shrinking. And investors appear hesitant that the trends will pick up because the stock has fallen 15% in the last five years. All in all, the inherent trends aren't typical of multi-baggers, so if that's what you're after, we think you might have more luck elsewhere.Align Technology does have some risks though, and we've spotted   1 warning sign for Align Technology  that you might be interested in.If you want to search for solid companies with great earnings, check out this free list of companies with good balance sheets and impressive returns on equity.Have feedback on this article?

This move lagged the S&amp;P 500's daily gain of 0.75%. Elsewhere, the Dow gained 0.4%, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq added 10.36%.Heading into today, shares of the energy company had lost 6.59% over the past month, outpacing the Oils-Energy sector's loss of 6.78% and lagging the S&amp;P 500's loss of 5.98% in that time.Investors will be hoping for strength from Marathon Oil as it approaches its next earnings release. The company is expected to report EPS of $0.97, up 25.97% from the prior-year quarter. Our most recent consensus estimate is calling for quarterly revenue of $1.82 billion, up 0.95% from the year-ago period.Investors might also notice recent changes to analyst estimates for Marathon Oil. These recent revisions tend to reflect the evolving nature of short-term business trends. As a result, we can interpret positive estimate revisions as a good sign for the company's business outlook.Based on our research, we believe these estimate revisions are directly related to near-team stock moves. To benefit from this, we have developed the Zacks Rank, a proprietary model which takes these estimate changes into account and provides an actionable rating system.The Zacks Rank system, which ranges from #1 (Strong Buy) to #5 (Strong Sell), has an impressive outside-audited track record of outperformance, with #1 stocks generating an average annual return of +25% since 1988. Within the past 30 days, our consensus EPS projection has moved 0.62% lower. Marathon Oil is currently a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Digging into valuation, Marathon Oil currently has a Forward P/E ratio of 6.15. For comparison, its industry has an average Forward P/E of 11.12, which means Marathon Oil is trading at a discount to the group.We can also see that MRO currently has a PEG ratio of 0.51. This popular metric is similar to the widely-known P/E ratio, with the difference being that the PEG ratio also takes into account the company's expected earnings growth rate. Oil and Gas - Integrated - United States stocks are, on average, holding a PEG ratio of 0.51 based on yesterday's closing prices.Story continuesThe Oil and Gas - Integrated - United States industry is part of the Oils-Energy sector.

That is because the Jan 20, 2023 $2.00 Call had some of the highest implied volatility of all equity options today. What is Implied Volatility?Implied volatility shows how much movement the market is expecting in the future. Options with high levels of implied volatility suggest that investors in the underlying stocks are expecting a big move in one direction or the other. It could also mean there is an event coming up soon that may cause a big rally or a huge sell-off. However, implied volatility is only one piece of the puzzle when putting together an options trading strategy.What do the Analysts Think?Clearly, options traders are pricing in a big move for Marathon Oil shares, but what is the fundamental picture for the company? Currently, Marathon Oil is a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) in the Oil and Gas - Integrated - United States industry that ranks in the Bottom  38% of our Zacks Industry Rank. Over the last 60 days, three analysts have increased their earnings estimates for the current quarter, while five have dropped their estimates. The net effect has taken our Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current quarter from $1.01 per share to 97 cents in that period.Given the way analysts feel about Marathon Oil right now, this huge implied volatility could mean there’s a trade developing. Oftentimes, options traders look for options with high levels of implied volatility to sell premium. This is a strategy many seasoned traders use because it captures decay. At expiration, the hope for these traders is that the underlying stock does not move as much as originally expected.Looking to Trade Options?Check out the simple yet high-powered approach that Zacks Executive VP Kevin Matras has used to close recent double and triple-digit winners.

We're taking a pause. We need to focus on integration activities,"" Chief Financial Officer James Kehoe said in a post-earnings conference call.The company could still make targeted acquisitions, but those would likely be in the hundreds of millions of dollars range, Kehoe said.Shares of the company fell over 6% after same-store sales at its pharmacy business missed expectations in the first quarter, and as it reported a quarterly loss versus a year-ago profit due to a $6.5 billion opioid-related litigation charge.Walgreens spent $5.5 billion in 2021 to take majority stakes in healthcare providers VillageMD and CareCentrix, and VillageMD later struck a $9 billion deal to buy urgent care provider Summit Health in November 2022.Pharmacy sales during the quarter dropped about 4% even amid high demand for cough and cold drugs during one of the worst U.S. flu seasons in a decade.Walgreens said same-store pharmacy sales rose 4.8% in the reported quarter from a year earlier, but below Evercore ISI's estimates of 5% growth.Comparisons from last year when there was a COVID surge are ""masking some positive changes we are seeing with Walgreens building its U.S. Healthcare business and improvements the company has made in its drugstores post-pandemic,"" Edward Jones analyst John Boylan said.Net loss attributable to Walgreens was $3.72 billion, for the quarter ended Nov. 30, compared with a profit of $3.58 billion, a year earlier.(Reporting by Raghav Mahobe and Aditya Samal in Bengaluru; Editing by Vinay Dwivedi and Shailesh Kuber)]"

(Nasdaq: WBA) today announced financial results for the first quarter of fiscal 2023, which ended November 30, 2022.Chief Executive Officer Rosalind Brewer said:""WBA delivered a solid start to the fiscal year, as we continue to accelerate our transformation to a consumer-centric healthcare company. We're making significant progress in driving our U.S. Healthcare segment to scale and profit, including the recent VillageMD acquisition of Summit Health. Our core retail pharmacy businesses in both the United States and United Kingdom remain resilient in challenging operating environments. Execution across segments reinforces our confidence in achieving full-year guidance, and our strategic actions are creating long-term shareholder value.""Overview of First Quarter ResultsWBA first quarter sales decreased 1.5 percent from the year-ago quarter to $33.4 billion, an increase of 1.1 percent on a constant currency basis. Excluding the negative impact from AllianceRx Walgreens of 485 basis points and the positive contributions from U.S. Healthcare M&amp;A of 280 basis points, sales growth was 3.2 percent on a constant currency basis.Operating loss was $6.2 billion in the first quarter compared to operating income of $1.3 billion in the year-ago quarter. Operating loss in the quarter reflects a $6.5 billion pre-tax charge for opioid-related claims and litigation. Adjusted operating income was $1.0 billion, a decrease of 42.2 percent on a constant currency basis, reflecting lower volumes of COVID-19 vaccinations and testing compared to the peak prior year period, planned payroll and IT investments in U.S. Retail Pharmacy and growth investments in U.S. Healthcare. This was partly offset by improved retail contributions in the U.S. and International.Net loss in the first quarter was $3.7 billion compared to net income of $3.6 billion in the year-ago quarter. This decrease is driven by a $5.2 billion after-tax charge for opioid-related claims and litigation offset by a $0.9 billion after-tax gain from the partial sale of the Company's equity method investment in AmerisourceBergen during the first quarter; and lapping $2.5 billion after-tax gain on the Company's investments in VillageMD and Shields Health Solutions in the year-ago quarter. Adjusted net earnings was $1.0 billion, down 30.2 percent on a constant currency basis, primarily driven by lower adjusted operating income partly offset by the favorable impact of a lower tax rate compared with the year-ago quarter primarily due to the release of valuation allowance related to capital loss carryforwards.Loss per share in the first quarter was $4.31, compared to earnings per share of $4.13 in the year-ago quarter. Adjusted earnings per share decreased 30.8 percent to $1.16, reflecting a decrease of 29.9 percent on a constant currency basis.Net cash provided by operating activities was $493 million in the first quarter. Operating cash flow was negatively impacted by increased inventory build for the U.S. and UK holiday season. Free cash flow was negative $117 million, a $762 million decrease compared with the year-ago quarter primarily driven by lower earnings versus the prior year quarter, phasing of working capital, and increased capital expenditures in growth initiatives, including the VillageMD footprint expansion, the rollout of micro-fulfillment centers, and digital transformation initiatives.Business HighlightsWBA continues to achieve strong results across its business and strategic priorities, including:Transform and align the coreContinuing to play a leading role in COVID-19 vaccinations and testing, administering 8.4 million vaccinations in the quarterU.S. retail comparable sales growth of 1.4 percent, or 2.1 percent excluding tobacco, on top of strong prior year performance of 10.6 percent, or 11.7 percent excluding tobaccoExpanded U.S. retail margins while managing supply chain costs, maintaining price positioning vs. competitors, and stabilizing shrink levelsU.S. pharmacy comparable script volume growth of 2.1 percent excluding immunizationsOperating nine automated micro-fulfillment centers at quarter-end, supporting ~3,000 storesInvesting in labor to return impacted stores to normal operating hoursBoots UK retail comparable sales growth of 8.7 percent on top of robust prior year growth of 16.3 percentBuild our next growth engine with consumer-centric healthcare solutionsInvested $3.5 billion to support VillageMD’s acquisition of Summit Health, a leading independent provider of primary, specialty, and urgent careClosed full acquisition of Shields on December 28, 2022Full acquisition of CareCentrix expected to close in the third quarter of fiscal 2023Achieved calendar year 2022 target for co-located VillageMD clinics of 200, as part of 393 total clinics now openExceeded calendar year 2022 target for Walgreens Health Corners: 112 vs. goal of 100Focus the portfolio; optimize capital allocationSold 19.2 million shares of AmerisourceBergen common stock in November and December, with total after-tax cash proceeds of $3 billionSold stake of Guangzhou Pharmaceuticals in December for approximately $150 millionBuild a high-performance culture and a winning teamStrong U.S. Healthcare leadership team in place, including President and Chief Growth OfficerAppointed Bryan Hanson to the Board of Directors, bolstering leadership experience in healthcare and technologyEliminated all task-based metrics for retail pharmacy staff, further enabling pharmacists to practice at the top of their license while creating a differentiated work environmentBusiness SegmentsU.S. Retail Pharmacy:The U.S. Retail Pharmacy segment had first quarter sales of $27.2 billion, a decrease of 3.0 percent from the year-ago quarter. Comparable sales increased 3.8 percent from the year-ago quarter while lapping strong comparable sales of 7.9 percent in the year-ago quarter. The year-ago quarter included a significant contribution from COVID-19 vaccinations.Pharmacy sales decreased 4.2 percent compared to the year-ago quarter, negatively impacted by a 7.8 percentage point headwind from AllianceRx Walgreens. Comparable pharmacy sales increased 4.8 percent in the quarter compared to the year-ago quarter, benefiting from higher branded drug inflation. Comparable prescriptions filled in the first quarter were flat to the year-ago quarter, while comparable prescriptions excluding immunizations increased 2.1 percent compared with the year-ago quarter, a sequential improvement of 220 basis points compared to the prior quarter. Total prescriptions filled in the quarter, including immunizations, adjusted to 30-day equivalents, decreased 0.7 percent to 311.6 million.Retail sales increased 0.8 percent and comparable retail sales increased 1.4 percent in the first quarter compared with the year-ago quarter. Excluding tobacco, comparable retail sales increased 2.1 percent, aided by strong cough, cold, flu sales representing a tailwind of 220 bps, partly offset by lower sales of OTC test kits representing a headwind of 170 basis points. Beauty and personal care categories both grew, benefiting from owned brand offerings and improved inventory availability.Gross profit decreased 7.3 percent compared with the year-ago quarter. Adjusted gross profit decreased 7.2 percent. Gross profit and adjusted gross profit were driven by lower contributions from COVID-19 vaccinations and testing and reimbursement net of procurement savings, partially offset by higher retail gross profit from higher sales and gross margin expansion.Selling, general and administrative expenses (SG&amp;A) increased 129.8 percent from $5.1 billion in the year-ago quarter to $11.7 billion. SG&amp;A in the quarter reflects a $6.5 billion pre-tax charge for opioid-related claims and litigation. Adjusted SG&amp;A increased 2.5 percent to $4.9 billion, driven by $100 million of increased labor investments, and incremental IT and digital investments, partly offset by cost savings from the Transformational Cost Management Program.Operating loss in the first quarter was $5.8 billion compared to operating income of $1.4 billion from the year-ago quarter, reflecting the $6.5 billion charge for opioid-related claims and litigation. Adjusted operating income decreased 34.6 percent to $1.1 billion from the year-ago quarter, reflecting lower COVID-19 vaccination volumes, continued reimbursement pressure, and planned labor investments, partly offset by improved higher retail gross profit from higher sales and gross margin expansion.International:The International segment had first quarter sales of $5.2 billion, a decrease of 10.8 percent from the year-ago quarter, held back by an adverse currency impact of 15.4 percent. Sales increased 4.6 percent on a constant currency basis, with Boots UK sales growing 4.3 percent, and the Company's Germany wholesale business growing 4.2 percent.Boots UK comparable pharmacy sales decreased 0.9 percent compared with the year-ago quarter, due to lower demand for COVID-19 services compared to the year-ago quarter. Boots UK comparable retail sales increased 8.7 percent compared to the year-ago quarter, growing market share for the 7th consecutive quarter. Footfall improved by around 8 percent, compared to the year-ago quarter. Boots.com continued to perform well, accounting for 18 percent of retail sales in the quarter compared to 9 percent pre-pandemic. In November, Boots.com percent of sales reached almost 23 percent, including the biggest ever single day of digital sales for the business, on Black Friday.Gross profit decreased 13.0 percent compared with the year-ago quarter, including an adverse currency impact of 15.1 percent. Gross profit increased 2.1 percent on a constant currency basis, reflecting higher UK retail sales growth, and strong execution in our Germany wholesale business, partially offset by lower demand for COVID-19 related services in the UK and the adverse gross margin impact of National Health Service pharmacy funding.SG&amp;A in the quarter decreased 18.2 percent from the year-ago quarter to $944 million, reflecting a favorable currency impact of 14.9 percent, lower acquisition-related costs, and lower costs related to the Transformational Cost Management Program compared to the year-ago quarter. Adjusted SG&amp;A increased 5.6 percent on a constant currency basis, reflecting increased in-store and marketing activities, higher inflation, and the expiration of temporary COVID-19 related rental reductions received in the year-ago quarter.Operating income increased 96.5 percent from the year-ago quarter to $106 million, reflecting lower acquisition related costs and restructuring activity, partially offset by an adverse currency impact of 18.8 percent. Adjusted operating income decreased 28.9 percent to $116 million, a decrease of 20.3 percent on a constant currency basis compared with the year-ago quarter, as strong growth in UK retail and Germany was more than offset by lower demand for COVID-19 related services in the UK, the adverse gross margin impact of NHS pharmacy funding, and the expiration of COVID-19 rental reductions received in the year-ago quarter.U.S. Healthcare:The U.S. Healthcare segment had first quarter sales of $989 million, an increase of $938 million compared to the prior year period. On a pro forma basis, this segment's businesses grew sales at a combined rate of 38.4 percent in the quarter. VillageMD grew 48.7 percent, reflecting existing clinic growth and clinic footprint expansion. Shields grew 44.1 percent, driven by recent contract wins, further expansion of existing partnerships, and strong executional focus. CareCentrix grew 22.3 percent as a result of additional service offerings with existing partners.Gross profit was $17 million and adjusted gross profit was $43 million. Shields and CareCentrix gross profit was more than offset by the VillageMD expansion. VillageMD added 119 clinics compared to the year-ago quarter for a total of 375 total clinics open.First quarter SG&amp;A was $454 million, and adjusted SG&amp;A was $195 million. Adjusted SG&amp;A increased $162 million compared to the prior year quarter, due to the year-over-year impact of acquisitions and higher investments in the organic business.Operating loss was $436 million. Adjusted operating loss was $152 million, which excludes certain costs related to stock compensation expense and amortization of acquired intangible assets. Adjusted EBITDA was negative $124 million, reflecting a full quarter of VillageMD results compared to six days of results in the year-ago quarter and growth in organic business investments, partly offset by positive contributions from Shields and CareCentrix.Conference CallWBA will hold a conference call to discuss the first quarter results beginning at 8:30 a.m. Eastern time today, January 5, 2023.

AND SUBSIDIARIESSUPPLEMENTAL INFORMATION (UNAUDITED)REGARDING NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES(in millions, except per share amounts)The following information provides reconciliations of the supplemental non-GAAP financial measures, as defined under SEC rules, presented in this press release to the most directly comparable financial measures calculated and presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (GAAP). The Company has provided the non-GAAP financial measures in the press release, which are not calculated or presented in accordance with GAAP, as supplemental information and in addition to the financial measures that are calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP.These supplemental non-GAAP financial measures are presented because management has evaluated the Company’s financial results both including and excluding the adjusted items or the effects of foreign currency translation, as applicable, and believes that the supplemental non-GAAP financial measures presented provide additional perspective and insights when analyzing the core operating performance of the Company’s business from period to period and trends in the Company’s historical operating results. These supplemental non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered superior to, as a substitute for or as an alternative to, and should be considered in conjunction with, the GAAP financial measures presented in the press release.The Company does not provide a reconciliation for non-GAAP estimates on a forward-looking basis where it is unable to provide a meaningful or accurate calculation or estimation of reconciling items and the information is not available without unreasonable effort. This is due to the inherent difficulty of forecasting the timing or amount of various items that have not yet occurred, are out of the Company’s control and/or cannot be reasonably predicted, and that would impact diluted net earnings per share, the most directly comparable forward-looking GAAP financial measure. For the same reasons, the Company is unable to address the probable significance of the unavailable information. Forward-looking non-GAAP financial measures provided without the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures may vary materially from the corresponding GAAP financial measures.Constant currencyThe Company also presents certain information related to current period operating results in ""constant currency,"" which is a non-GAAP financial measure. These amounts are calculated by translating current period results at the foreign currency exchange rates used in the comparable period in the prior year. The Company presents such constant currency financial information because it has significant operations outside of the U.S. reporting in currencies other than the U.S. dollar and this presentation provides a framework to assess how its business performed excluding the impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations.Comparable salesFor the Company's U.S. Retail Pharmacy and International segments, comparable sales are defined as sales from stores that have been open for at least twelve consecutive months without closure for seven or more consecutive days, including due to store damage, and without a major remodel or being subject to a natural disaster, in the past twelve months as well as e-commerce sales. E-commerce sales include digitally initiated sales online or through mobile applications. Relocated stores are not included as comparable sales for the first twelve months after the relocation. Acquired stores are not included as comparable sales for the first twelve months after acquisition or conversion, when applicable, whichever is later. Comparable sales, comparable pharmacy sales, comparable retail sales, comparable number of prescriptions and comparable number of 30-day equivalent prescriptions refer to total sales, pharmacy sales, retail sales, number of prescriptions and number of 30-day equivalent prescriptions, respectively. The method of calculating comparable sales varies across the retail industry. As a result, the Company's method of calculating comparable sales may not be the same as other retailers’ methods.With respect to the International segment, comparable sales, comparable pharmacy sales and comparable retail sales, are presented on a constant currency basis, which is a non-GAAP financial measure. Refer to the discussion above in ""Constant currency"" for further details on constant currency calculations.Key Performance IndicatorsThe Company considers certain metrics, such as comparable sales, comparable pharmacy sales, comparable retail sales, comparable number of prescriptions, comparable 30-day equivalent prescriptions, number of payor/ provider partnerships, number of locations of Walgreens Health Corners, number of VillageMD co-located clinics and number of total VillageMD clinics, at period end, to be key performance indicators because the Company’s management has evaluated its results of operations using these metrics and believes that these key performance indicators presented provide additional perspective and insights when analyzing the core operating performance of the Company from period to period and trends in its historical operating results. These key performance indicators should not be considered superior to, as a substitute for or as an alternative to, and should be considered in conjunction with, the GAAP financial measures presented herein. These measures may not be comparable to similarly-titled performance indicators used by other companies.With respect to the total number of VillageMD clinics, clinics are defined as the primary care locations where the Company or the Company’s affiliates lease or license space and the providers are employed by either the Company or one of the Company’s affiliates. These clinics are primarily branded as Village Medical where the Company employs the providers but, in some instances, may operate under their own brands.NET (LOSS) EARNINGS AND DILUTED NET (LOSS) EARNINGS PER SHARE(in millions)Three months ended November 30,20222021Net (loss) earnings attributable to Walgreens Boots Alliance, Inc.

The Company excludes these charges when evaluating operating performance because it does not incur such charges on a predictable basis and exclusion of such charges enables more consistent evaluation of the Company’s operating performance. These charges are recorded within Selling, general and administrative expenses. During the three months ended November 30, 2022, the Company recorded a $6.5 billion charge related to the previously announced opioid litigation settlement frameworks and certain other opioid-related matters.2Transformational Cost Management Program charges are costs associated with a formal restructuring plan. These charges are primarily recorded within Selling, general and administrative expenses. These costs do not reflect current operating performance and are impacted by the timing of restructuring activity.3Acquisition-related amortization includes amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets, inventory valuation adjustments and stock-based compensation fair valuation adjustments. Amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets includes amortization of intangible assets such as customer relationships, trade names, trademarks, developed technology and contract intangibles. Intangible asset amortization excluded from the related non-GAAP measure represents the entire amount recorded within the Company’s GAAP financial statements. The revenue generated by the associated intangible assets has not been excluded from the related non-GAAP measures. Amortization expense, unlike the related revenue, is not affected by operations of any particular period unless an intangible asset becomes impaired, or the estimated useful life of an intangible asset is revised. These charges are primarily recorded within Selling, general and administrative expenses. Business combination accounting principles require us to measure acquired inventory at fair value. The fair value of the inventory reflects cost of acquired inventory and a portion of the expected profit margin. The acquisition-related inventory valuation adjustments exclude the expected profit margin component from cost of sales recorded under the business combination accounting principles. The stock-based compensation fair valuation adjustment reflects the difference between the fair value based remeasurement of awards under purchase accounting and the grant date fair valuation. Post-acquisition compensation expense recognized in excess of the original grant date fair value of acquiree awards are excluded from the related non-GAAP measures as these arise from acquisition-related accounting requirements or agreements, and are not reflective of normal operating activities.4Acquisition-related costs are transaction and integration costs associated with certain merger, acquisition and divestitures related activities. These costs include charges incurred related to certain mergers, acquisition and divestitures related activities recorded in operating income, for example, costs related to integration efforts for merger, acquisition and divestitures activities. Examples of such costs include deal costs, severance and stock compensation. These charges are primarily recorded within Selling, general and administrative expenses. These costs are significantly impacted by the timing and complexity of the underlying merger, acquisition and divestitures related activities and do not reflect the Company’s current operating performance.5Adjustments to equity earnings in AmerisourceBergen consist of the Company’s proportionate share of non-GAAP adjustments reported by AmerisourceBergen consistent with the Company’s non-GAAP measures.6The Company’s U.S. Retail Pharmacy segment inventory is accounted for using the last-in-first-out (""LIFO"") method. This adjustment represents the impact on cost of sales as if the U.S. Retail Pharmacy segment inventory is accounted for using first-in first-out (""FIFO"") method. The LIFO provision is affected by changes in inventory quantities, product mix, and manufacturer pricing practices, which may be impacted by market and other external influences. Therefore, the Company cannot control the amounts recognized or timing of these items.7Gain or loss on certain derivative instruments used as economic hedges of the Company’s net investments in foreign subsidiaries. These charges are recorded within Other income, net. We do not believe this volatility related to mark-to-market adjustment on the underlying derivative instruments reflects the Company’s operational performance.8Includes significant gains on business combinations due to the remeasurement of previously held minority equity interests and debt securities to fair value. During the three months ended November 30, 2021, the Company recorded such pre-tax gains of $2.2 billion and $402 million for VillageMD and Shields, respectively.9Includes significant gains on the sale of equity method investments. During the three months ended November 30, 2022, the Company recorded a gain of $969 million in Other income, net due to a partial sale of its equity method investment in AmerisourceBergen.10Adjustments to income tax (benefit) provision include adjustments to the GAAP basis tax (benefit) provision commensurate with non-GAAP adjustments and certain discrete tax items including U.S. and UK tax law changes and equity method non-cash tax. These charges are recorded within income tax (benefit) provision.11Adjustments to post tax earnings (loss) from other equity method investments consist of the proportionate share of certain equity method investees’ non-cash items or unusual or infrequent items consistent with the Company’s non-GAAP adjustments. These charges are recorded within post tax earnings (loss) from other equity method investments. Although the Company may have shareholder rights and board representation commensurate with its ownership interests in these equity method investees, adjustments relating to equity method investments are not intended to imply that the Company has direct control over their operations and resulting revenue and expenses. Moreover, these non-GAAP financial measures have limitations in that they do not reflect all revenue and expenses of these equity method investees.12Due to the anti-dilutive effect resulting from the reported net loss, the impact of potentially dilutive securities on the per share amounts has been omitted from the quarterly calculation of weighted-average common shares outstanding for diluted EPS for the three months ended November 30, 2022.13Includes impact of potentially dilutive securities in the quarterly calculation of weighted-average common shares, diluted for adjusted diluted net earnings per common share calculation purposes for the three months ended November 30, 2022.NON-GAAP RECONCILIATIONS BY SEGMENT(in millions)Three months ended November 30, 2022U.S. RetailPharmacy1InternationalU.S.HealthcareCorporate andOtherWalgreens BootsAlliance, Inc.Sales$27,204$5,189$989$—$33,382Gross profit (GAAP)$5,886$1,050$17$—$6,953LIFO provision18———18Acquisition-related amortization5—26—...]"

They’re well-established in nature, have greater analyst coverage, and commonly pay dividends, undoubtedly significant perks that make them so beloved among investors.While many of these stocks no longer enjoy supercharged growth, there are still several currently top-ranked large-caps with impressive earnings outlooks, including PepsiCo PEP, Deere &amp; Company DE, and Paychex Inc.

103,2bc8635f-21c3-367e-a1cc-33293da56201,PAYX,2023-01-05,Paychex (PAYX) Upgraded to Buy: What Does It Mean for the Stock?,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/paychex-payx-upgraded-buy-does-170005679.html,1672851605,STORY,['PAYX'],"[Paychex (PAYX) could be a solid choice for investors given its recent upgrade to a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). An upward trend in earnings estimates -- one of the most powerful forces impacting stock prices -- has triggered this rating change.The Zacks rating relies solely on a company's changing earnings picture. It tracks EPS estimates for the current and following years from the sell-side analysts covering the stock through a consensus measure -- the Zacks Consensus Estimate.Since a changing earnings picture is a powerful factor influencing near-term stock price movements, the Zacks rating system is very useful for individual investors. They may find it difficult to make decisions based on rating upgrades by Wall Street analysts, as these are mostly driven by subjective factors that are hard to see and measure in real time.As such, the Zacks rating upgrade for Paychex is essentially a positive comment on its earnings outlook that could have a favorable impact on its stock price.Most Powerful Force Impacting Stock PricesThe change in a company's future earnings potential, as reflected in earnings estimate revisions, has proven to be strongly correlated with the near-term price movement of its stock. That's partly because of the influence of institutional investors that use earnings and earnings estimates for calculating the fair value of a company's shares. An increase or decrease in earnings estimates in their valuation models simply results in higher or lower fair value for a stock, and institutional investors typically buy or sell it. Their bulk investment action then leads to price movement for the stock.Fundamentally speaking, rising earnings estimates and the consequent rating upgrade for Paychex imply an improvement in the company's underlying business. Investors should show their appreciation for this improving business trend by pushing the stock higher.Harnessing the Power of Earnings Estimate RevisionsAs empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock movements, tracking such revisions for making an investment decision could be truly rewarding. Here is where the tried-and-tested Zacks Rank stock-rating system plays an important role, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions.Story continuesThe Zacks Rank stock-rating system, which uses four factors related to earnings estimates to classify stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), has an impressive externally-audited track record, with Zacks Rank #1 stocks generating an average annual return of +25% since 1988. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;.Earnings Estimate Revisions for PaychexFor the fiscal year ending May 2023, this payroll processor and human-resources services provider is expected to earn $4.26 per share, which is a change of 13% from the year-ago reported number.Analysts have been steadily raising their estimates for Paychex. Over the past three months, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company has increased 1.1%.Bottom LineUnlike the overly optimistic Wall Street analysts whose rating systems tend to be weighted toward favorable recommendations, the Zacks rating system maintains an equal proportion of 'buy' and 'sell' ratings for its entire universe of more than 4000 stocks at any point in time. Irrespective of market conditions, only the top 5% of the Zacks-covered stocks get a 'Strong Buy' rating and the next 15% get a 'Buy' rating. So, the placement of a stock in the top 20% of the Zacks-covered stocks indicates its superior earnings estimate revision feature, making it a solid candidate for producing market-beating returns in the near term.You can learn more about the Zacks Rank here &gt;&gt;&gt;The upgrade of Paychex to a Zacks Rank #2 positions it in the top 20% of the Zacks-covered stocks in terms of estimate revisions, implying that the stock might move higher in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Still, the volatility among Chinese equities over the last few years has soured a lot of investors from wanting to invest directly in Chinese companies.However, here are two stocks that may be “safer” investments after mainland China has mostly ended its Zero-Covid policy and reopened the economy.Starbucks SBUXThe first stock on the list is a very familiar name. Starbucks has over 6,000 stores in China, but its headquarters and upper management is in Seattle, Washington.Starbucks will get a significant boost from mainland China reopening. In fact, at the end of the company’s most recent fiscal fourth quarter, the U.S. and China comprised 61% of Starbucks’ global portfolio with 15,878 stores in the U.S. and 6,021 stores in China.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchAs mainland China continues its Zero-Covid recovery and reopening it is quite plausible that earnings estimates will continue to rise for Starbucks stock. For now, Starbucks lands a Zack Rank #3 (Hold).Starbucks earnings are currently expected to climb 15% in fiscal 2023 and jump another 17% in FY24 to $4.01 per share. Even better, earnings estimate revisions have steadily trended higher over the last 90 days for both FY23 and FY24. Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchSales are projected to be up 11% in FY23 and rise another 11% in FY24 at $39.85 billion. More importantly, fiscal 2024 would represent 50% growth from pre-pandemic levels with 2019 sales at $26.50 billion.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchYum China YUMC Another more “trustworthy” investment for exposure to the Chinese economy is Yum Brands’ spinoff Yum China, which operates KFCs, Pizza Huts, and Taco Bells among other restaurant establishments in China.While YUMC, like most Chinese stocks, is subject to auditing by the SEC under the Holding Foreign Companies Accountable Act (HFCAA), it is more likely to comply as a franchiser of American restaurants.Story continuesYum China stands to benefit from a China reopening with a large presence among its KFC and Pizza Hut franchises specifically. There are over 8,000 KFC locations across more than 1,600 cities in China with 2,500 Pizza Hut locations in over 600 Chinese cities.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchYum China’s stock currently lands a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) with earnings estimate revisions trending significantly higher for its current fiscal 2022.Earnings are now projected to decline -13% for 2022 at $1.05 per share but this is up from estimates of $0.92 a share last quarter. Plus, FY23 earnings are expected to rebound and jump 56% to $1.64 per share although estimates have slightly gone down.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchOn the top line, sales are forecasted to decline -2% for FY22 but jump 14% in FY23 at $11.04 billion. Even better, FY23 would be a 25% increase from pre-pandemic levels with 2019 sales at $8.77 billion.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchBottom line Starbucks and Yum China looked poised to benefit from the reopening of the Chinese economy and should be safer investments in terms of volatility and SEC regulations. Both companies’ top and bottom lines should appreciate significantly as China’s Zero-Covid restrictions have eased and hopefully improves their future performances and valuation as well.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

105,9bf0285a-fbac-305b-844a-1c706f91471f,SBUX,2023-01-05,Starbucks Is Changing Their Rewards — How Many Stars You’ll Now Need for a Latte,GOBankingRates,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/starbucks-changing-rewards-many-stars-205627315.html,1672865787,STORY,['SBUX'],"[monticelllo / Getty ImagesStarting Monday, Feb. 13, Starbucks will require more star rewards to get your favorite drinks. The coffee giant announced back in December it would be changing the structure of its rewards program.See: 11 Grocery Items To Buy at Dollar TreeFind: 10 Things To Stop Buying in 2023These new tiers are now in effect:100 Stars for a hot drip coffee or tea, iced coffee or iced tea, bakery item (including a cake pop or cookie), or a packaged snack such as potato chips or popcorn.200 Stars for an espresso beverage such as a latte or macchiato, Frappuccino or a hot breakfast staple like a breakfast sandwich.300 Stars for a packaged food item such as a sandwich, protein box or salad — or a bag of whole bean coffee.These new redemption qualifications are a steep difference from what has long been in place for the Starbucks rewards program. Previous to the Feb. 13 changeover, 50 stars were required for drip coffee, tea or a bakery item; 150 stars for an espresso drink, Frappuccino or hot breakfast item; and 200 stars for a prepared, packaged food item.Customers were also able to customize their drinks with a choice of milk or a flavor enhancer for just 25 stars, and that seems to be staying in place.The only “better deal” out of the new update is the fact that claiming a bag of coffee beans now requires only 300 stars, versus 400 stars currently.Disappointment With New Starbucks Stars Program AboundsThe announced changes have made many customers upset, according to Daily Hive, who screen captured a series of Twitter posts that share a collective wave of disappointment.“To earn one free cup of coffee using a prepaid card you have to buy 17 cups. Using cash or linked credit card you have to buy 34 cups.

In third-quarter 2022, revenues in the segment rose 9.8% year over year.

Southwest Airlines (LUV), which belongs to the Zacks Transportation - Airline industry, could be a great candidate to consider.This airline has seen a nice streak of beating earnings estimates, especially when looking at the previous two reports. The average surprise for the last two quarters was 16.53%.For the last reported quarter, Southwest came out with earnings of $0.50 per share versus the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $0.41 per share, representing a surprise of 21.95%. For the previous quarter, the company was expected to post earnings of $1.17 per share and it actually produced earnings of $1.30 per share, delivering a surprise of 11.11%.Price and EPS SurpriseThanks in part to this history, there has been a favorable change in earnings estimates for Southwest lately. In fact, the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) for the stock is positive, which is a great indicator of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with its solid Zacks Rank.Our research shows that stocks with the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time. In other words, if you have 10 stocks with this combination, the number of stocks that beat the consensus estimate could be as high as seven.The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is related to change. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Southwest has an Earnings ESP of +4.37% at the moment, suggesting that analysts have grown bullish on its near-term earnings potential. When you combine this positive Earnings ESP with the stock's Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), it shows that another beat is possibly around the corner. The company's next earnings report is expected to be released on January 26, 2023.Story continuesWith the Earnings ESP metric, it's important to note that a negative value reduces its predictive power; however, a negative Earnings ESP does not indicate an earnings miss.Many companies end up beating the consensus EPS estimate, but that may not be the sole basis for their stocks moving higher. On the other hand, some stocks may hold their ground even if they end up missing the consensus estimate.Because of this, it's really important to check a company's Earnings ESP ahead of its quarterly release to increase the odds of success.

Your estimated wait time is 1 hour and 5 minutes. We are experiencing a high volume of traffic and using a virtual queue to limit the amount of users on the website at the same time.”The airline says the bonus points are worth more than $300.

Following Buffett’s ownership, Berkshire has operated as a holding company, with the famous investor buying troubled businesses and bringing them back to prosperity.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchExamples of such brands include GEICO, Duracell, and Fruit of The Loom, among others. Outside of these renowned transformations, Berkshire’s main businesses revolve around insurance, freight rail transportation, utility, and energy generation and distribution.In its own right, Goldman Sachs has a long history that dates back to 1869 when Marcus Goldman and his son and son-in-law Samuel Sachs became renowned for their “commercial paper business.” Mr. Sachs purchased promissory notes from local merchants during a period of tight and expensive bank credit and sold them to New York’s commercial banks.Today, Goldman Sachs has continued its financial prowess evolving into a financial conglomerate and investment banking giant that operates on a global scale. Goldman Sachs is now a leading provider of international banking, securities, investment management, and consumer banking services. Performance &amp; Valuation Over the last year, Berkshire Hathaway is up +1% to outperform Goldman Sachs -13% and the S&amp;P 500’s -20% decline. Gazing at the last decade, Berkshire Hathaway’s is now up +233% to top Goldman Sachs and the benchmark.Story continuesZacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchTrading around $314 per share BRK.B trades at 20.8X forward earnings. In comparison, GS stock trades at $347 per share and just 10.3X forward earnings.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchGoldman Sachs certainly appears attractive from a valuation standpoint, trading 40% below its decade high of 17.1X and on par with the median of 10.4X. Similarly, Berkshire trades 31% beneath its decade-long high of 30.4X and also near its median of 20.4X.Goldman Sachs does stick out in terms of a broader market perspective as well, trading below the benchmark’s 17.2X with Berkshire Hathaway just above these levels.Growth &amp; Outlook Pivoting to growth, Berkshire’s earnings are now projected to pop 22% for 2022 and jump another 12% in fiscal 2023 at $16.62 per share. Even better, earnings estimate revisions have largely gone up over the last 30 days.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchOn the top line, sales are forecasted to be up 8% for 2022 and rise another 2% in FY23 at $305.90 billion. Fiscal 2023 would represent 20% growth from pre-pandemic levels with 2019 sales at $254.61 billion. This is impressive growth considering the size and age of a company like Berkshire Hathaway.Turning to Goldman Sachs, earnings are expected to decline -44% for 2022 at $33.46 per share. This is following a very tough-to-compete-with year and exceptional earnings of $59.45 a share in 2021. Fiscal 2023 earnings are expected to stabilize and rise 13% to $37.87 per share. Earnings estimates have slightly declined over the last 90 days.Sales are forecasted to dip -20% for 2022 and rise 8% in FY23 to $51.32 billion. Fiscal 2023 would be an impressive 40% increase from pre-pandemic levels with 2019 sales at $36.54 billion.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchBottom Line At the moment, Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.B) stock looks like the more attractive option to start 2023 with its earnings estimate revisions trending much higher for FY22 and FY23. This lands BRK.B stock a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). Goldman Sachs (GS), on the other hand, continues to churn out strong bottom-line results, along with its attractive valuation.

That is because the Jan 20, 2023 $2.50 Call had some of the highest implied volatility of all equity options today.What is Implied Volatility?Implied volatility shows how much movement the market is expecting in the future. Options with high levels of implied volatility suggest that investors in the underlying stocks are expecting a big move in one direction or the other. It could also mean there is an event coming up soon that may cause a big rally or a huge sell-off. However, implied volatility is only one piece of the puzzle when putting together an options trading strategy.What do the Analysts Think?Clearly, options traders are pricing in a big move for Schlumberger shares, but what is the fundamental picture for the company? Currently, Schlumberger is a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) in the Oil and Gas - Field Services industry that ranks in the Top 16% of our Zacks Industry Rank. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current quarter has moved up from 68 cents per share to 69 cents in that period.Given the way analysts feel about Schlumberger right now, this huge implied volatility could mean there’s a trade developing. Oftentimes, options traders look for options with high levels of implied volatility to sell premium. This is a strategy many seasoned traders use because it captures decay. At expiration, the hope for these traders is that the underlying stock does not move as much as originally expected.Looking to Trade Options?Check out the simple yet high-powered approach that Zacks Executive VP Kevin Matras has used to close recent double and triple-digit winners.

It also represents a significant bridging of the divides between Sony Pictures Entertainment, Sony PlayStation and Sony Music, according to a dozen current and former senior executives interviewed by Reuters.“I defined our identity as a creative entertainment company with a solid foundation on technology,” Sony chief executive Kenichiro Yoshida said.The film’s appearance at CES on a stage typically reserved for big-screen TVs and robot pets caps $10 billion in investments in music, games and anime over the last five years.“Gran Turismo” is one of 10 game-inspired film and television projects in various stages of development.HBO's “The Last of Us,” about a man hired to smuggle a 14-year-old girl across a pandemic-plagued America, debuts on Jan. 15. “The New Yorker” suggested the series could break the curse of bad video-game adaptations.Last month, Amazon Prime Video ordered “God of War,” a live action adaptation of the PlayStation hit based on Greek mythology.Sony’s “creative entertainment” company approach extends beyond content.A Sony-Honda electric vehicle, scheduled to reach consumers by 2026, is being framed as a rolling showcase of Sony’s entertainment, gaming and camera sensor prowess.It will also generate recurring subscription revenue like other content services.“Eventually, we think in the long term, the mobility space will become an entertainment space,” Yoshida said.Story continuesThe high-profile projects, which could not have happened even three years ago, grew out of regular conversations among Sony executives, as they sought a way to work together more effectively.Sony resisted chasing after Netflix with a rival service and fended off an activist shareholder’s call to sell or spin off its media and entertainment assets in 2013.Instead it struck deals to provide movies to Netflix and Walt Disney Co's Disney+ and series to HBO, Amazon and Apple Inc's Apple TV+. The shift is reflected in Sony’s results, with two-thirds of operating profit coming from games, music and the film studio. Operating profit rose 8% to 344 billion yen ($2.6 billion) for the July-September quarter, beating analyst estimates. In November, with the music business offsetting weakness in the games group, Sony hiked its full-year operating profit forecast.“This is a complete pivot of this company into something that’s no longer an electronics company,” said Ulrike Schaede, a professor of Japanese Business at UC San Diego’s School of Global Policy and Strategy.Schaede said the company now has a coherent corporate narrative that would make it easier to unite the company’s divisions.“That's the new Sony,” she said. “Now, can they deliver? I don't know.”TREASURE CHESTWhen veteran media executive Tony Vinciquerra was recruited as chairman of Sony Pictures in 2017, the division was reeling after a string of box office flops including the 2016 reboot of the “Ghostbusters” franchise. DVD and Blu-ray disc revenue had plummeted under pressure from streaming services, and there were rumors of a possible sale, media executives said.But Vinciquerra was attracted by the opportunity to leverage the company’s assets: “Sony is the only company in the media business that has not only television or film, but music, PlayStation, and technology,” he said in an interview.Sony had struggled for decades to achieve the “synergy” the company touted with its 1989 acquisition of Columbia Pictures Entertainment.At best, these forced collaborations ended up as product placement in a movie or marketing promotion. At worst, they got in the way of adapting to the digital era. Entertainment executives then came up with PlayStation Productions: a division within the games group located on the Culver City studio lot and dedicated to film and television adaptations.It acted as a cultural attaché to Hollywood, “someone who could talk in their language,” PlayStation chief Jim Ryan said in an interview, “in a non-confrontational, non-adversarial way just, you know, just try to do the best thing for both divisions.”The result was “Uncharted,” last year’s release starring ""Spider-Man’s"" Tom Holland and Mark Wahlberg in a hunt for Magellan’s lost treasure. The film delivered $401 million in global ticket sales and became the most-watched film on Netflix when it was released on the streaming service in August.Meanwhile, one of the most popular artists distributed by Sony Music, the Puerto Rican rapper Benito Antonio Martínez Ocasio, who performs as “Bad Bunny,"" will star in “El Muerto,” a film drawn from Sony’s Marvel Universe of characters, due out in 2024. Bad Bunny is a Rimas Entertainment artist.Sony Music Entertainment CEO Rob Stringer said Yoshida’s “light touch” has proven successful. “Quite frankly, the ideas are flying around, and everyone's much, much more comfortable about talking to each other,” Stringer said.This August will bring another test of Sony’s strategy when “Gran Turismo” hits theaters after languishing for 12 years.The movie is based on British racer Jann Mardenborough, who won the 2011 GT Academy Europe at 19 and went on to a podium finish at the 24-Hours of Le Mans in 2013.Academy Award-nominated director of “District 9” Neil Blomkamp directs a cast that includes “Lord of the Rings” star Orlando Bloom and “Stranger Things” actor David Harbour.“We’re telling a true story about wish fulfillment,” PlayStation Productions chief Asad Qizilbash said. “This kid loved playing Gran Turismo, and at the same time, we’re celebrating the game.” (Reporting by Dawn Chmielewski in Los Angeles, additional reporting by Kiyoshi Takenaka in Tokyo; Edited by Kenneth Li and Suzanne Goldenberg in New York.)]"

This is because investors always try to position themselves ahead of time and look to tap stocks that are high quality in nature.Yum China YUMC, Chewy CHWY, Phillips 66 PSX, Workday WDAY and Sprinklr CXM are some stocks that are likely to deliver an earnings surprise in their upcoming release.Why Is a Positive Earnings Surprise So Important?Historically, stocks of companies with solid quarterly earnings (on a nominal basis) tank if they miss or merely meet market expectations. After all, a 20% earnings rise (though apparently looks good) doesn’t tell you if earnings growth has been exhibiting a decelerating trend.Also, seasonal fluctuations come into play sometimes. If a company’s Q1 is seasonally weak and Q4 strong, then it is likely to report a sequential earnings decline. In such cases, growth rates are misleading while judging the true health of a company.On the other hand, after much brainstorming and analysis of companies’ financials and initiatives, Wall Street analysts project earnings of companies. They in fact club their insights and a company’s guidance when deriving an earnings estimate.Thus, outperforming that estimate is almost equivalent to beating the company’s own expectation as well as the market perception. And if the margin of earnings surprise is big, it typically drives the stock higher right after the release. Thus, more than anything else, an earnings surprise can push a stock higher.How to Find Stocks that Can Beat?Now, finding stocks that have the potential to beat on the bottom line may be investors’ dream but not an easy job. One way to do this is to look at the earnings surprise history of the company.An impressive track in this regard generally acts as a catalyst in sending a stock higher. It indicates the company’s ability to surpass estimates. And investors generally believe that the company will apply the same secret sauce to execute yet another earning beat in its next release.Story continuesThe Winning StrategyIn order to shortlist stocks that are likely to come up with an earnings surprise, we chose the following as our primary screening parameters.Last EPS Surprise greater than or equal to 10%: Stocks delivering positive surprise in the last quarter tend to surprise again.Average EPS Surprise in the last four quarters greater than 20%: We lifted the bar for outperformance slightly higher by setting the average earnings surprise for the last four quarters at 20%.Average EPS Surprise in the last two quarters greater than 20%: This points to a more consistent surprise history and makes the case for another surprise even stronger.In addition, we place a few other criteria that push up the chance of a positive surprise.Zacks Rank less than or equal to 2: Only companies with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) rating can get through.Earnings ESP greater than zero: A stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank of #1, 2 or 3 (Hold) for an earnings beat to happen, as per our proven model.In order to zero in on those that have long-term growth potential and high trading liquidity we have added the following parameters too:Next 3–5 Years Estimated EPS Growth (Per Year) greater than 10%: Solid expected earnings growth exhibits the stock’s long-term growth prospects.Average 20-day Volume greater than 100,000: High trading volume implies that the stocks have adequate liquidity.The criteria have narrowed down the universe from more than 7,700 stocks to five.Here are all five stocks:Yum China: Yum China’s U.S. operations are based in Texas. The company operates both company-owned and franchised restaurants. The stock carries a Zacks Rank #2. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.YUMC delivered an average earnings surprise of  263.39% in the last four quarters.Chewy: Chewy operates as an online pet retailer. The company offers pet products, which include dry and wet food, toys, mats, biscuits, vitamins and supplements. It has a Zacks Rank #2.CHWY came up with an average earnings surprise of 82.59% in the last four quarters.Phillips 66: This Zacks Rank #2 company’s operations incorporate refining, midstream, marketing and specialties, and chemicals.The four-quarter average earnings surprise of PSX is 28.05%.Workday: This Zacks Rank #2 company is a provider of enterprise-level software solutions for financial management and human resource domains.The four-quarter average earnings surprise of WDAY is 7.32%.Sprinklr: Zacks Rank #2 Sprinklr provides a unified customer experience management platform for modern enterprises.The four-quarter average earnings surprise of CXM is 102.78%.The Research Wizard is a great place to begin.

145,0cb575e2-2bce-35a6-9a62-fa0e245fbbed,NEM,2023-01-05,Can Gold Hedge Your Investment Portfolio in 2023?,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/gold-hedge-investment-portfolio-2023-220710395.html,1672870030,STORY,"['GC=F', 'NEM', 'GOLD']","[Every investor has an opportunity to wipe the slate clean and start from scratch in 2023.If you had a good year or broke even in 2022, congrats you crushed it! 2022 was one of the most challenging years on record. If you didn’t do so well, don’t worry you're not alone. Accept your results, and learn from your mistakes, everyone is starting from zero now just like you.So where are we making money this year? I’m no gold bug, but in my opinion 2023 is shaping up like it may be a big year for the yellow metal. Most major analysts agree that 2023 is going to be a challenging one for most asset markets.With the Fed and international central banks chugging along with their interest rate hikes, a recession, and higher interest rates are likely on the horizon. Inflation is still stubbornly high as well.I agree with most analysts on the outlook and expect to see another challenging year.Gold finished 2022 nearly unchanged, with the SPDR Gold Trust (GLD) down just 0.8%. Yet from November to year end it moved 200 points off its lows and has entered 2023 with considerable relative strength and a strong trend on multiple time frames. I think this strong trend will soon become a persistent trend. Why Gold?Gold is something of an enigmatic asset and can evoke very broad and extreme reactions from different investors. To someone like Warren Buffett, a business analyst and owner, there is no position for gold in his portfolio.From Buffett’s perspective, there is no point. It has no earnings, produces nothing, and only changes value in nominal terms. Buffett invests in businesses with sound business models, and considerable free cash flow. If he is feeling risk adverse, he would rather hold cash or short-term US Treasuries.On the other side of the spectrum, you have gold bugs like Peter Schiff, who believe there is a financial Armageddon coming. He thinks you should hold outsized positions in physical gold to hedge in the event of a major economic, currency, or political crisis. That gold will be the only haven, as it has been used as a form of currency and store of value for thousands of years.Story continuesThen somewhere in the middle you have an investor like Ray Dalio. As a macro trader, and founder of Bridgewater Associates one of the largest hedge fund in the world he helps manage huge sums for sovereign wealth funds, and pensions.Dalio’s mandate is to achieve adequate returns, with limited downside risk so that these institutions can predictably fund their activities. Ideally, he wants to do well when broad markets are not. He pragmatically believes gold plays a role in portfolios, as its low and negative correlation to traditional asset markets will improve his risk adjusted returns during the most challenging years.For a very risk averse investor, a permanent portfolio allocation of 5-20% to gold should reduce the volatility of a portfolio vs. holding just bonds and equities. On the other hand, an active investor or trader, with a higher tolerance for risk may enter gold and related financial products speculatively with a stop-loss to mitigate risk.How to Invest?In addition to the GLD ETF some other forms of gold exposure can be achieved by buying the stocks of individual gold mining companies, or a gold mining ETF. Buying the mining ETF or individual names will come with more volatility and risk than directly buying exposure to just the commodity. GDX is the popular mining ETF, and the largest components are Newmont Corp (NEM) and Barrick Gold Corp (GOLD).GDX is one of the most popular ways to get involved in gold investing. By investing in this product, you are going to really juice up the returns if there is a big bull market in gold.Newmont and Barrick Gold both earn Zacks Rank #3 (Holds) and have seen their stock prices charge higher in the last few weeks. Barrick Gold is part of the Mining – Gold industry that ranks in the top 30% of over 250 Zacks industries, with a 2.2% dividend yield (think they might have raised recently too)Newmont’s Mining is also in top third of all the Zacks industries. Plus, NEM’s 4.4% dividend yield is rather enticing. Both Newmont and Barrick Gold also sport very impressive balance sheets that will come in handy during the ongoing economic turbulence.Something worth considering is that these gold stocks will have a great deal of influence from macro factors, rather than business fundamentals. They are of course still important and worth digging deeper into finding appealing businesses even within an industry such as gold will further improve your downside risk, and upside returns.Why so Bullish?There are several fundamental factors underlying a bullish view on gold. First, while we have begun to see inflation ease, it has only been ever so slightly. There have so far only been two CPI prints where the rate of inflation has increased less than expected. Only the very early signs of slowing inflation.Running above 7%, and core inflation at 6% both remain well above the Fed’s target of 2%. Second, with regards to Federal Reserve policy, there is still a lack of clarity on future policy. Interest rates are the guiding feature of modern capital markets, and regimes like this can lead to uncertainty and high volatility, which is when gold really shines.Third, according to the IMF central banks have purchased more than 600 tons of gold in 2022, which is more than any time in the last 55 years.Convincing Technical SetupLastly, there is a decisive long-term technical chart pattern on the gold chart. The well-known cup and handle pattern has been built on the 20yr, monthly candle chart with some well-defined risk points. A close below last year’s low should invalidate the setup, while a breakout above 2000 can launch the price to ~$2400. TradingviewImage Source: TradingviewWhat can Go Wrong?Of course, no trade is a guarantee and while price alone may invalidate the trade, what else might go wrong? Inflation can surprise to the downside, tensions between Russia and Ukraine can ease (one can only hope), and general market uncertainty may subside. Additionally, it should be noted that periods of high interest rates are generally not great for the prospect of higher gold prices. Although, if it coincides with periods of high uncertainty, gold can remain bid.Gold is a very interesting asset and can be caught up in many different dogmas and narratives. I think when looked at pragmatically, it can be a valuable addition to some investor’s portfolios. Disclosure: Officers, directors and/or employees of Zacks Investment Research may own or have sold short securities and/or hold long and/or short positions in options that are mentioned in this material.

U.S. Treasury yields fell sharply after the minutes to a three-week low.Still, the Fed minutes also showed that policymakers were hyper focused on bringing down inflation, and are set to keep U.S. interest rates higher for longer. Such a scenario is likely to limit gains in metal markets.Spot gold rose slightly to $1,855.45 an ounce, while gold futures steadied around $1,860.80 an ounce by 19:26 ET (00:26 GMT), reaching their highest level since mid-June. Both instruments logged a strong start to 2023, and are up nearly 2% over the past two sessions.Bullion prices were also boosted by increased safe haven demand for assets apart from the dollar, especially after a warning from the International Monetary Fund that the world’s largest economies face a potential recession in 2023.But broader metal markets slipped on the prospect of a global economic slowdown. Among industrial metals, copper prices crept lower and were headed for a third straight day of losses, following a dismal start to the new year.Copper futures fell 0.1% in early Asian trade to $3.7412 a pound, and are trading down nearly 2% since their last close in 2022.Uncertainty over an economic reopening in China weighed heavily on the red metal, as the world’s largest copper importer faces an overwhelming spike in COVID-19 infections.While copper demand is expected to recover eventually as the Chinese economy reopens, prices are set for more near-term volatility as the timeline for said reopening remains unclear.Story continuesSigns of slowing business activity in other major economies also weighed on industrial metals. U.S. manufacturing activity shrank for a second straight month in December, data showed on Wednesday, furthering fears of an economic slowdown in the country.Nickel prices plummeted 6% after the U.S. reading, while the prices of precious metals with industrial applications, such as platinum and silver, also declined.Related ArticlesGold nears 7-month high as Fed minutes indicate slower rate hikesVenezuela's lack of dredging causes trouble for Chevron's heavy oil exportsOil falls more than 5% on global economy worry, China COVID cases]"

Effective January 4, 2023, the size ranges will be updated as follows:Previous Market Capitalization Eligibility CriteriaUpdated Market Capitalization Eligibility CriteriaUnadjusted company market capitalization of: US$ 14.6 billion or more for the S&amp;P 500US$ 3.7 billion to US$ 14.6 billion for the S&amp;P MidCap 400US$ 850 million to US$ 3.7 billion for the S&amp;P SmallCap 600Unadjusted company market capitalization of: US$ 12.7 billion or more for the S&amp;P 500US$ 4.6 billion to US$ 12.7 billion for the S&amp;P MidCap 400US$ 750 million to US$ 4.6 billion for the S&amp;P SmallCap 600Based on favorable feedback received from the S&amp;P Composite 1500 Index Consultation on Market Capitalization and Liquidity Eligibility Criteria, the Index Committee is adopting the proposals on Market Capitalization Guidelines and Float Adjusted Liquidity (""FALR""). These ranges will be reviewed at the beginning of every calendar quarter, updated as needed to ensure they reflect current market conditions and expressed in dollar ranges. These minimum market capitalization guidelines are designed to capture the three-month average cumulative total company level market capitalization of the S&amp;P Total Market Index (""TMI"") universe at approximately the following cumulative percentiles:S&amp;P 500 – 85th percentileS&amp;P MidCap 400 index – 85th-93rd percentileS&amp;P SmallCap 600 index – 93rd-99th percentileAt the quarterly review, if the new market capitalization ranges for any of the Composite 1500 indices deviate by 10% or more from the current range, the index committee will consider a market capitalization range update for all underlying indices. Updates, if needed, are officially announced with immediate effect.Companies passing the total company-level market capitalization criteria must also have a security level float-adjusted market capitalization (FMC) that is at least 50% of the respective index's total company-level minimum market capitalization threshold.Story continuesThese adjustments to the market capitalization guidelines may result in added turnover in the S&amp;P Composite 1500 indices as the indices gradually reflect shifts in the market capitalization guidelines ranges for the underlying indices over time.The FALR ratio eligibility requirement will be lowered from 1.00 to 0.75, reflecting the increased liquidity in the market for announced Composite 1500 additions.To increase clarity, the Liquidity eligibility criteria in the U.S. Indices methodology is being updated to show that only U.S. consolidated volume is included in the FALR calculation, and that public companies considered to be U.S. domiciled for index purposes will have their U.S. volume annualized as of the evaluation date if they do not have 365 calendar days of trading history on a U.S. exchange. The phrase ""across all venues (including historical values)"" is being removed.Previous FALR Eligibility CriteriaUpdated FALR Eligibility CriteriaFloat adjusted liquidity ratio (""FALR"") must be greater than or equal to 1.0 at the time of addition to the S&amp;P Composite 1500.Float adjusted liquidity ratio (""FALR"") must be greater than or equal to 0.75 at the time of addition to the S&amp;P Composite 1500.As a reminder, the market capitalization eligibility criteria are for additions to an index, not for continued membership. As a result, an index constituent that appears to violate criteria for addition to that index is not removed unless ongoing conditions warrant an index change.A history of market cap ranges dating back to 2007 can be found in Appendix A of the U.S. Indices methodology. The U.S. Indices methodology document will be updated soon to reflect the changes.

Increases were $82.5 billion versus $78.6 billion, and decreases were $14.3 billion compared to $8.8 billion in 2021. Excluding AT&amp;T's $6.9 billion reduction in Q1 2022, associated with its WarnerMedia spinoff, the 2022 decreases have been $7.4 billion, a 16.1% decline from 2021.""Dividend payments continue at record levels. The strength of the increases has declined, as concerns over interest rates, inflation and slowing consumer spending have made companies more measured and cautious in their commitment to dividend increases. At this point, 2023 appears set to increase, setting another record,"" said Howard Silverblatt, Senior Index Analyst at S&amp;P Dow Jones Indices. ""For 2023, the number of increases is expected to grow, with February being the most popular month for increases, even as the average increase is expected to be limited when measured against recent inflationary metrics.""Story continuesWithin the S&amp;P 500, Q4 cash dividends set a record payment, and were up 10.2% over Q4 2021. For all of 2022, dividends set a new record, posting a 10.8% increase in the actual cash payment over 2021. S&amp;P 500 dividend payments have increased for 13 consecutive years, and set a payment record for the last 11 consecutive years.""2023 appears set for another record payment, with the key question being by how much as the answer may depend on the state of the economy and corporate profits. The uncertain forecast for 2023 dividend payments is also driven by several factors including changes in inflation, interest rates, and consumer spending. Overall, it is clear that companies are currently protecting their dividends, even if it means reducing buybacks,"" Silverblatt concluded.Buybacks, which set a record in Q1 2022 at $281 billion, declined in Q2 to $220 billion and in Q3 to $211 billion, with Financial issues pulling back on their expenditures. For Q4 2022, buyback activity appears to have increased as companies accelerated their purchases to avoid the new 1% buyback tax set to start in 2023.S&amp;P 500 DividendsOn a per share basis, S&amp;P 500 Q4 2022 dividend payments set a record, increasing 4.4% to $17.39 from Q3 2022's $16.66, and were up 10.2% from Q4 2021 $15.78 payment.

U.S. Treasury yields fell sharply after the minutes to a three-week low.Still, the Fed minutes also showed that policymakers were hyper focused on bringing down inflation, and are set to keep U.S. interest rates higher for longer. Such a scenario is likely to limit gains in metal markets.Spot gold rose slightly to $1,855.45 an ounce, while gold futures steadied around $1,860.80 an ounce by 19:26 ET (00:26 GMT), reaching their highest level since mid-June. Both instruments logged a strong start to 2023, and are up nearly 2% over the past two sessions.Bullion prices were also boosted by increased safe haven demand for assets apart from the dollar, especially after a warning from the International Monetary Fund that the world’s largest economies face a potential recession in 2023.But broader metal markets slipped on the prospect of a global economic slowdown. Among industrial metals, copper prices crept lower and were headed for a third straight day of losses, following a dismal start to the new year.Copper futures fell 0.1% in early Asian trade to $3.7412 a pound, and are trading down nearly 2% since their last close in 2022.Uncertainty over an economic reopening in China weighed heavily on the red metal, as the world’s largest copper importer faces an overwhelming spike in COVID-19 infections.While copper demand is expected to recover eventually as the Chinese economy reopens, prices are set for more near-term volatility as the timeline for said reopening remains unclear.Story continuesSigns of slowing business activity in other major economies also weighed on industrial metals. U.S. manufacturing activity shrank for a second straight month in December, data showed on Wednesday, furthering fears of an economic slowdown in the country.Nickel prices plummeted 6% after the U.S. reading, while the prices of precious metals with industrial applications, such as platinum and silver, also declined.Related ArticlesGold nears 7-month high as Fed minutes indicate slower rate hikesVenezuela's lack of dredging causes trouble for Chevron's heavy oil exportsOil falls more than 5% on global economy worry, China COVID cases]"

183,5fa72cad-ff26-43ba-a524-1d6a400a24a4,QCOM,2023-01-05,Magic Leap CEO Peggy Johnson on the AR revolution,Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/magic-leap-ceo-peggy-johnson-on-the-ar-revolution-193620889.html,1672860980,STORY,"['MSFT', 'QCOM']","[While working at Qualcomm (QCOM) in the 90s and early 2000s, Peggy Johnson helped advance the mobile phone revolution.Now, as CEO of Magic Leap, she’s doing the same for augmented reality (AR). In November, the company launched Magic Leap 2, a high-tech set AR headset that allows users to see virtual images in 3D.Unlike the first iteration of the product released in 2018, the Magic Leap 2 is lighter, faster, and has a larger field of view. It also targets industries ranging from defense to health care rather than consumers more broadly. The device costs $3,299.Magic Leap, which is private, has roughly 1,000 employees and is based in South Florida. In 2020, Johnson joined the company as CEO. Previously, she spent 6 years as vice president of business development at Microsoft (MSFT). Before that, she spent 25 years at Qualcomm, where she served as Executive Vice-President of Global Market Development, among other positions.Johnson recently joined Yahoo Finance’s Andy Serwer to discuss subjects including Magic Leap’s product, the company’s future, and gender diversity.Some edited highlights from the conversation:What Magic Leap does: “So, we make a head-mounted device. You wear it over your eyes. You can actually think of it as a computer on your eyes. And you still see your physical world around you, but we place digital content very smartly in that physical world. It is augmented reality. And how that's different from virtual reality is virtual reality, usually, you put something on your eyes, and you're fully occluded. You're fully in another virtual world.”Magic Leap 2 AR gogglesOn Magic Leap 1 versus Magic Leap 2: “The device still today is awesome, the initial device. But they pointed the company largely at the consumer market…The size of the device was not really something consumers would wear for a very long time. It was a little bit heavy. And then the cost, you know, it was sold through some consumer channels and side by side with a phone ... There wasn't a winning combination there. However, just having gotten the device to where it is was a big start. And then that put us on the road to Magic Leap 2, which was built from the ground up to be used by the enterprise initially.”Story continuesOn how Magic Leap was ahead of its time: “In fact, Magic Leap has been in the industry, I think, for much longer than most of the players that we hear about now— over a decade, as I said. And so it was ahead of its time, but the vision was right. And the tech and the ability to make the tech had to catch up. For me, I think of it as just like mobile phones. So that was the industry I grew up in. I spent 25 years at Qualcomm. And they went through that same trajectory.”On the privacy challenges of Magic Leap: “I think we have to get ahead of this. This device has much more imagery and sensors that go far beyond, say, what a phone does. And I think we're already concerned about our data on a phone. So, we need to from the get-go protect that data, whether it's corporate data or consumer data. For instance, the camera's looking at your eyes. You can do a bio identity of somebody. And so, we have to be careful, keep that data secure. The good thing about our company, Magic Leap, is the only thing we do is build a platform, an augmented reality platform. We don't have a business model where we're dependent on that data. And so from our standpoint, that's highly personal data that needs to be contained and protected at all times and only released when the user or the company is allowing that.”On Magic Leap’s competitors and how its product is different: “Just to talk about the consumer-facing companies, there are some devices out there that you'll see, largely, they solve one problem. And that's great. There's use cases they're solving for. Those are great use cases. But they're not highly immersive augmented reality. And by that, I mean, many of them are just heads up displays. So you put the lenses on, and maybe there's notifications across the top. There's some cues that help you do your job better, or as a consumer, might be entertaining you or showing you where to walk to the next building you have to go to. And that's all fine.Ours is quite a bit different in that we are the most immersive augmented reality device out there. So, the digital content that are in front of your eyes in Magic Leap is very accurately placed, so much so that we have to trick your eyes into thinking it's there.”On the Metaverse: “I have a bit of a reaction to Metaverse because I think actually if you Google Metaverse, what comes up is it's a virtual reality world. And while it is that, I think that that's constraining to what I think is the true promise of the Metaverse. And that is this heads up world where our head can come back up from our phones, set the phone down, and you're back in your physical world. And the data that you were seeking on your phone just lives very comfortably in your field of view. And you don't trip over the coffee table.So, you're mobile. You can keep going about your work. And it's just augmenting how you're viewing your digital content. So, it's really when the digital and physical worlds merge seamlessly, I think that's the true promise of the Metaverse.”On regulation: “I think we've learned from the releases of previous versions of all sorts of technologies, even going back to the mobile phone, that we have to be responsible. We can't just unleash new technologies to the world and expect others to be responsible for the use of it. We have to think about, what can this technology do? What are the good things, but also what are the harmful things that it might do if put into the wrong hands or in the wrong scenarios?”On female engineers: ""It's sort of this untapped community. But in order for them to come in, they have to feel included and have the right environments that wouldn't cause them to leave after a few years, like so many of my colleagues did. And so that's changing as well. We definitely have companies who understand that. They're working to have the most inclusive environments.”On the future of AR and what she’s trying to accomplish: “I see augmented reality as the next paradigm in computing. And it feels to me the same way the mobile phone did in the early days. Like, this is going to be a thing. It's definitely going to be more than just a handful of businesses buying it. This is the start of something. [As] mobile phones were. I feel that same feeling about augmented reality. I think it's going to be the next tool that we all have on, hopefully someday even in contact form, so you don't even notice that it's in there. But it's helping you.

But that $3.84 billion amounted to only 35 percent of 2019, before Covid-19 changed the world.Story continuesChina domestic tourism — and Trip.com Group, among others — might be the winner in the short run as wary destinations aren’t really laying out the red carpet for Chinese tourists given the spike in Covid-19 infections there since the abandonment of the zero-Covid policy. Some countries, including the UK, Canada, Spain, Australia, India, the U.S. and France are reintroducing compulsory pre-flight Covid-19 tests for arrivals from China.Others, such as Japan and Italy, require on-arrival tests while Morocco has announced an outright ban on travelers coming from China.Airbnb might have benefited from a resurgence in China domestic tourism but it withdrew from the China domestic market midway through 2022.An Uptick in China Inbound FlightsAirlines are also taking a cautious approach as aviation data provider Cirium noted that scheduled flights into China from January-March are up by a little less than 3 percent during the December 29 week compared to the previous week.And then there are post-Covid issues plaguing the tourism industry like a shortage of human capital. Aviation, travel and hospitality businesses will also need to ramp up recruitment if there is indeed a surge of Chinese tourists.The wait will have to be a little longer for travel companies that hope to to get Chinese tourists to take 155 million outbound trips and spend more than $130 billion overseas, like they did in 2019.

The award has been provided by the Naval Air Systems Command, Patuxent River, MD.Details of the DealValued at $18.7 million, the contract is projected to be completed by September 2025. Per the terms of the deal, Raytheon will procure long-lead materials, parts and components for F135 propulsion systems for F-35 Lighting II Joint Strike Fighter aircraft from the 17th lot.A major portion of the work related to this deal will be carried out in Indianapolis, IN and Windsor Locks, CT. The contract will serve the non-U.S. Department of Defense (DOD) partners and Foreign Military Sales (FMS) customers.Raytheon’s Growth ProspectsIn recent times, combat aircraft are witnessing a surge in demand with the rapid rise in political risks and global terrorism. In this context, F-35 jets, built by America’s largest defense contractor, Lockheed Martin LMT, enjoy a lucrative position in the combat aircraft arena and witness a steady flow of orders from the U.S. Army, seven international partner countries and eight FMS customers.Lockheed Martin has delivered 841 F-35 airplanes since the program's inception, with 271 jets in the backlog as of September 2022. The strong international demand for F-35 in the first three quarters of 2022 resulted in multiple order wins for LMT and RTX.The production of F-35 jets is expected to continue for many years, given the U.S. government's current inventory target of 2,456 aircraft for the Air Force, Marine Corps and Navy.Consequently, Pratt &amp; Whitney, which builds F-35’s engine, is expected to witness more order inflows for the F-35 engine and its propulsion system in the coming days. This should significantly bolster this defense contractor’s top line.Benefits for PeersApart from Lockheed Martin and Raytheon, defense majors that stand to benefit from the expanding production rates of F-35 are as follows:Northrop Grumman NOC renders its expertise in carrier aircraft and low-observable stealth technology for the F-35 program.

Due to its high mission-capable rate, large payload, long range, persistence and ability to employ nuclear and conventional precision standoff weapons, the B-52 continues to be a critical contributor to the U.S. National Security Strategy.Growth ProspectsWith rising security threats across the globe, emerging economies like South America, the Asia Pacific, and the Middle East are spending a lot on enhancing their defense arsenals. Meanwhile, Europe and the United States have already been leading the defense market. With the United States being the largest worldwide weapons exporter, the nation has been spending amply on defense products. Boeing, the largest aircraft manufacturer in the United States, thus enjoys a dominant position in the combat aircraft market.Per a Mordor Intelligence report, the global military aviation market is expected to witness a CAGR of 5.3% during the 2022-2028 time period, with North America constituting the largest share of this market. Such growth can be attributed to a rise in global threats and geopolitical instabilities and increased spending on defense.

While media reports about rating changes by these brokerage-firm employed (or sell-side) analysts often affect a stock's price, do they really matter?Before we discuss the reliability of brokerage recommendations and how to use them to your advantage, let's see what these Wall Street heavyweights think about PulteGroup (PHM).PulteGroup currently has an average brokerage recommendation (ABR) of 2.00, on a scale of 1 to 5 (Strong Buy to Strong Sell), calculated based on the actual recommendations (Buy, Hold, Sell, etc.) made by 12 brokerage firms. An ABR of 2.00 indicates Buy.Of the 12 recommendations that derive the current ABR, six are Strong Buy, representing 50% of all recommendations.Brokerage Recommendation Trends for PHMBroker Rating Breakdown Chart for PHMCheck price target &amp; stock forecast for PulteGroup here&gt;&gt;&gt;The ABR suggests buying PulteGroup, but making an investment decision solely on the basis of this information might not be a good idea. According to several studies, brokerage recommendations have little to no success guiding investors to choose stocks with the most potential for price appreciation.Are you wondering why? The vested interest of brokerage firms in a stock they cover often results in a strong positive bias of their analysts in rating it. Our research shows that for every ""Strong Sell"" recommendation, brokerage firms assign five ""Strong Buy"" recommendations.This means that the interests of these institutions are not always aligned with those of retail investors, giving little insight into the direction of a stock's future price movement. It would therefore be best to use this information to validate your own analysis or a tool that has proven to be highly effective at predicting stock price movements.Zacks Rank, our proprietary stock rating tool with an impressive externally audited track record, categorizes stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), and is an effective indicator of a stock's price performance in the near future. Therefore, using the ABR to validate the Zacks Rank could be an efficient way of making a profitable investment decision.Story continuesZacks Rank Should Not Be Confused With ABRAlthough both Zacks Rank and ABR are displayed in a range of 1-5, they are different measures altogether.Broker recommendations are the sole basis for calculating the ABR, which is typically displayed in decimals (such as 1.28). The Zacks Rank, on the other hand, is a quantitative model designed to harness the power of earnings estimate revisions. It is displayed in whole numbers -- 1 to 5.Analysts employed by brokerage firms have been and continue to be overly optimistic with their recommendations. Since the ratings issued by these analysts are more favorable than their research would support because of the vested interest of their employers, they mislead investors far more often than they guide.In contrast, the Zacks Rank is driven by earnings estimate revisions. And near-term stock price movements are strongly correlated with trends in earnings estimate revisions, according to empirical research.In addition, the different Zacks Rank grades are applied proportionately to all stocks for which brokerage analysts provide current-year earnings estimates. In other words, this tool always maintains a balance among its five ranks.There is also a key difference between the ABR and Zacks Rank when it comes to freshness. When you look at the ABR, it may not be up-to-date. Nonetheless, since brokerage analysts constantly revise their earnings estimates to reflect changing business trends, and their actions get reflected in the Zacks Rank quickly enough, it is always timely in predicting future stock prices.Is PHM a Good Investment?Looking at the earnings estimate revisions for PulteGroup, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has remained unchanged over the past month at $10.14.Analysts' steady views regarding the company's earnings prospects, as indicated by an unchanged consensus estimate, could be a legitimate reason for the stock to perform in line with the broader market in the near term.The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for PulteGroup. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stocks here &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;It may therefore be prudent to be a little cautious with the Buy-equivalent ABR for PulteGroup.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

This demonstration tire has passed all applicable regulatory testing as well as Goodyear's internal testing.The Goodyear Tire &amp; Rubber Company unveils a demonstration tire comprised of 90% sustainable materials. This demonstration tire has passed all applicable regulatory testing as well as Goodyear’s internal testing.This demonstration tire also tested to have lower rolling resistance when compared to the reference tire, made with traditional materials. Lower rolling resistance means this demonstration tire has the potential to offer better fuel savings and carbon footprint reduction.In addition, after announcing the capability to demonstrate a 70% sustainable-material tire in January 2022, Goodyear, working with its supply base, plans to sell a tire with up to 70% sustainable-material content in 2023. Consumers interested in purchasing this tire can register for updates at Goodyear.com/SustainableMaterialTire. Bringing a 90% sustainable-material tire to market will require further collaboration with the company's supply base to identify the scale necessary for these innovative materials to produce that specific tire at high volumes.""We continue to make progress toward our goal of introducing the first 100% sustainable-material tire in the industry by 2030,"" said Chris Helsel, senior vice president, Global Operations and Chief Technology Officer. ""The past year was a pivotal one toward achieving this goal. We researched new technologies, identified opportunities for further collaboration and utilized our team's tenacity to not only demonstrate our capabilities to produce a 90% sustainable-material tire, but to also produce a tire with up to 70% sustainable-material content this year. Our team continues to showcase its innovation and commitment to building a better future.""90% Sustainable-material Demonstration Tire - 17 Ingredients Across 12 Different Tire Components This 90% sustainable-material demonstration tire includes 17 featured ingredients across 12 different components, including:Story continuesCarbon black, which is included in tires for compound reinforcement and to help increase their life, has traditionally been made by burning various types of petroleum products. Goodyear's 90% sustainable-material demonstration tire features four different types of carbon black that are produced from methane, carbon dioxide, plant-based oil and end-of-life tire pyrolysis oil feedstocks. These carbon black technologies target reduced carbon emissions, circularity and the use of bio-based carbons, while still delivering on performance.The use of soybean oil in this demonstration tire helps keep the tire's rubber compound pliable in changing temperatures. Soybean oil is a bio-based resource that helps to reduce Goodyear's use of petroleum-based products. While nearly 100% of soy protein is used in food/animal feed applications, a significant surplus of oil is left over and available for use in industrial applications.Silica is an ingredient often used in tires to help improve grip and reduce fuel consumption. This demonstration tire includes a high-quality silica produced from rice husk waste residue (RHA silica), a byproduct of rice processing that is often discarded and put into landfills.Polyester is recycled from post-consumer bottles by reverting the polyester into base chemicals and reforming them into technical grade polyester used in tire cords.Resins are used to help improve and enhance tire traction performance. In this demonstration tire, traditional petroleum-based resins are replaced with bio-renewable pine tree resins.Bead wire and steel cords provide reinforcement in the structure of a radial tire. This demonstration tire uses bead wire and steel cord from steel with high-recycled content, which is produced using the electric arc furnace (EAF) process. The utilization of the EAF process allows for steel to be produced with reduced energy use and higher recycled content. The EAF process has the potential for lower greenhouse gas emissions in comparison with steel produced using a blast furnace.ISCC certified mass balance polymers from bio- and bio-circular feedstock are also included in this tire.The shift to sustainable materials is evident in some of Goodyear's current product lines. Today, eight product lines, and some racing tires, include soybean oil. In addition, Goodyear has more than doubled its use of RHA silica in its product lines since 2018. With the introduction of a tire with up to 70% sustainable-material content, Goodyear is demonstrating tangible commitment with in-market solutions to building a better future.*A sustainable material is defined as a bio-based/renewable, recycled material or one that may be produced using or contributing to other sustainable practices for resource conservation and/or emissions reductions including mass-balance materials. **The 90% sustainable-material tire has been developed as a demonstration tire, which means Goodyear has proven its ability to produce a consumer tire with a high-level of sustainable-material content.                               About The Goodyear Tire &amp; Rubber CompanyGoodyear is one of the world's largest tire companies.

The breakthrough will add more utility to what a tire can deliver by providing critical data that can help enhance vehicle safety and performance, increasing efficiency and value for Gatik's customers in the B2B short-haul market.Friction estimates from Goodyear’s SightLine solution were successfully able to detect low grip conditions, such as snowy or icy conditions, and make this information available to Gatik’s autonomous fleet.Goodyear and Gatik recently deployed road-friction detection capabilities in Canada through continuous measurement of tire sensor-derived information, which is paired with other vehicle data and connected to Goodyear's cloud-based proprietary algorithms to optimize vehicle performance. Friction estimates from Goodyear's SightLine solution were successfully able to detect low grip conditions, such as snowy or icy conditions, and make this information available to Gatik's autonomous fleet, enhancing safety and performance for Gatik's commercial operations in Canada's challenging winter climate.With road-friction data, tires can help enable smoother, safer and more sustainable driving. This is critical information for autonomous vehicles in terms of path planning and providing recommendations for safe driving speed, vehicle acceleration limits and vehicle following distance.Goodyear SightLine technology is designed to measure the tire wear state, load, inflation pressure and temperature. It combines that with real-time road-weather data and proprietary rubber friction models to estimate the tire-road friction potential. Having this information in real-time enables Gatik's fleet to safely and efficiently respond to challenging conditions within its operational design domain (ODD). While Goodyear's SightLine technology has tremendous future implications for autonomous driving, this year it is anticipated that Goodyear will also be deploying Goodyear SightLine technology on select original equipment vehicles bringing immediate utility to today's mobility market.Story continues""The tire is the only part of the vehicle that touches the ground, and this new level of data sophistication can communicate vital information to the vehicle, enhancing safety and performance,"" said Chris Helsel, Goodyear's senior vice president, Global Operations and Chief Technology Officer. ""This is another step to evolve the tire to not only deliver its core, traditional job but also be a nexus of new data and information.""""At Gatik, we're dedicated to providing our customers with a solution that continues to raise industry standards in safety, efficiency and performance,"" said Arjun Narang, Gatik's Chief Technology Officer and co-founder.

(NYSE:CCI) sold US$3.7m worth of stock, possibly indicating weakness in the future",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/insiders-crown-castle-inc-nyse-140028142.html,1672840828,STORY,['CCI'],"[In the last year, many Crown Castle Inc. (NYSE:CCI) insiders sold a substantial stake in the company which may have sparked shareholders' attention. Knowing whether insiders are buying is usually more helpful when evaluating insider transactions, as insider selling can have various explanations. However, shareholders should take a deeper look if several insiders are selling stock over a specific time period.While insider transactions are not the most important thing when it comes to long-term investing, logic dictates you should pay some attention to whether insiders are buying or selling shares. View our latest analysis for Crown Castle The Last 12 Months Of Insider Transactions At Crown CastleIn the last twelve months, the biggest single sale by an insider was when the Executive VP &amp; COO of Fiber, Christopher Levendos, sold US$2.1m worth of shares at a price of US$193 per share. While insider selling is a negative, to us, it is more negative if the shares are sold at a lower price. The silver lining is that this sell-down took place above the latest price (US$138). So it is hard to draw any strong conclusion from it.Happily, we note that in the last year insiders paid US$843k for 5.91k shares. But they sold 19.50k shares for US$3.7m. In total, Crown Castle insiders sold more than they bought over the last year. They sold for an average price of about US$190. We are not joyful about insider selling. But the selling was at much higher prices than the current share price (US$138), so it probably doesn't tell us a lot about the value on offer today. You can see the insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last year depicted in the chart below. If you click on the chart, you can see all the individual transactions, including the share price, individual, and the date!insider-trading-volumeIf you like to buy stocks that insiders are buying, rather than selling, then you might just love this free list of companies. (Hint: insiders have been buying them).Story continuesCrown Castle Insiders Bought Stock RecentlyOver the last quarter, Crown Castle insiders have spent a meaningful amount on shares. Not only was there no selling that we can see, but they collectively bought US$397k worth of shares. This makes one think the business has some good points.Does Crown Castle Boast High Insider Ownership?I like to look at how many shares insiders own in a company, to help inform my view of how aligned they are with insiders. Usually, the higher the insider ownership, the more likely it is that insiders will be incentivised to build the company for the long term. It's great to see that Crown Castle insiders own 0.5% of the company, worth about US$285m. I like to see this level of insider ownership, because it increases the chances that management are thinking about the best interests of shareholders.What Might The Insider Transactions At Crown Castle Tell Us?It is good to see recent purchasing. However, the longer term transactions are not so encouraging. The recent buying by some insiders , along with high insider ownership, suggest that Crown Castle insiders are fairly aligned, and optimistic. While we like knowing what's going on with the insider's ownership and transactions, we make sure to also consider what risks are facing a stock before making any investment decision. In terms of investment risks, we've identified 2 warning signs with Crown Castle and understanding them should be part of your investment process.But note: Crown Castle may not be the best stock to buy. So take a peek at this free list of interesting companies with high ROE and low debt.For the purposes of this article, insiders are those individuals who report their transactions to the relevant regulatory body.

203,23fe3c33-a354-36bf-8a05-cf176cf20fbf,MOS,2023-01-05,Mosaic (NYSE:MOS) shareholders have earned a 28% CAGR over the last three years,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/mosaic-nyse-mos-shareholders-earned-114822355.html,1672919302,STORY,['MOS'],"[The Mosaic Company (NYSE:MOS) shareholders might be concerned after seeing the share price drop 15% in the last quarter. But in three years the returns have been great. The share price marched upwards over that time, and is now 105% higher than it was. After a run like that some may not be surprised to see prices moderate. The thing to consider is whether the underlying business is doing well enough to support the current price.Let's take a look at the underlying fundamentals over the longer term, and see if they've been consistent with shareholders returns. See our latest analysis for Mosaic While the efficient markets hypothesis continues to be taught by some, it has been proven that markets are over-reactive dynamic systems, and investors are not always rational. One flawed but reasonable way to assess how sentiment around a company has changed is to compare the earnings per share (EPS) with the share price.Mosaic became profitable within the last three years. Given the importance of this milestone, it's not overly surprising that the share price has increased strongly.The company's earnings per share (over time) is depicted in the image below (click to see the exact numbers).earnings-per-share-growthWe consider it positive that insiders have made significant purchases in the last year. Even so, future earnings will be far more important to whether current shareholders make money. This free interactive report on Mosaic's earnings, revenue and cash flow is a great place to start, if you want to investigate the stock further.What About Dividends?It is important to consider the total shareholder return, as well as the share price return, for any given stock. The TSR incorporates the value of any spin-offs or discounted capital raisings, along with any dividends, based on the assumption that the dividends are reinvested. It's fair to say that the TSR gives a more complete picture for stocks that pay a dividend. In the case of Mosaic, it has a TSR of 111% for the last 3 years. That exceeds its share price return that we previously mentioned. This is largely a result of its dividend payments!Story continuesA Different PerspectiveIt's good to see that Mosaic has rewarded shareholders with a total shareholder return of 11% in the last twelve months. That's including the dividend. That gain is better than the annual TSR over five years, which is 11%. Therefore it seems like sentiment around the company has been positive lately. In the best case scenario, this may hint at some real business momentum, implying that now could be a great time to delve deeper. It's always interesting to track share price performance over the longer term. But to understand Mosaic better, we need to consider many other factors. For instance, we've identified   1 warning sign for Mosaic  that you should be aware of.There are plenty of other companies that have insiders buying up shares.

Meanwhile, Europe and the United States have already been leading the defense market. With the United States being the largest worldwide weapons exporter, the nation has been spending amply on defense products.

Such growth can be attributed to a rise in global threats and geopolitical instabilities and increased spending on defense. These projections should benefit Boeing along with other U.S.-based combat jet manufacturers like Northrop Grumman NOC, Lockheed Martin LMT and Textron TXT.Since its inception, Northrop Grumman has been a pioneer in the development of manned aircraft for combat.

In 2021, 52% of total revenue came from international sales.GRAILBiotech company GRAIL specializes in blood tests (liquid biopsies) for 50 forms of cancer, which it claims to detect before patients notice any symptoms. With early detection, patients and their doctors can get an early start on treatment, thus increasing the probability of success.GRAIL was spun off from Illumina in early 2016, although the latter did retain a 12% stake in the new company. In 2020, Illumina announced its intention to take over GRAIL again and followed up by doing so in 2021.Story continuesThe Federal Trade Commission announced on March 30, 2021 that it had filed an administrative complaint and asked a federal court to block the acquisition. According to the FTC, the deal would diminish innovation in the U.S. market for MCED [multi-cancer early detection] tests.The European Commission prohibited the acquisition on the same grounds as the FTC.An administrative law judge rejected the complaint in September 2022, ruling that the FTC had failed to prove there would be a substantial lessening of competition in the relevant market. The FTC has appealed the decision.Illumina expected both challenges when it announced the acquisition. Regarding the FTC, it wrote in its news release, There is no legal impediment to acquiring GRAIL in the U.S. Illumina is committed to working through the ongoing FTC administrative process, and as always, will abide by whatever outcome is ultimately reached in the U.S. courts.As for the EU challenge, it wrote, GRAIL has no business in the EU, and the company believes that the European Commission does not have jurisdiction to review the merger as the EU merger thresholds are not met, nor are they met in any EU member state.The company also argued there were compelling reasons for the deal to go ahead. First, it would speed up availability of GRAILs testing to doctors offices and could save 10,000 lives over a nine-year period.Second, it noted the two companies are not competitors, and the deal was a vertical acquisition. Third, the GRAIL test is available but is expensive because it is not covered by insurance. That would be reversed if Illumina owned the company.No one yet knows how the two challenges will work themselves out, but the Illumina share price is unlikely to make any sustainable gains until this shadow is lifted.Still, Illumina is a large-cap company with lots of other successful business interests, and should continue to make progress in the rest of its businesses.Financial strengthIllumina receives a 7 out of 10 ranking for its financial strength, based on its interest coverage ratio (a proxy for indebtedness), its debt-to-revenue ratio and its Altman Z-Score.Illumina: A Growth Stock in WaitingBringing GRAIL back into the fold cost Illumina $3.1 billion in cash, plus $4 billion worth of stock and other considerations. As a result, its debt has increased significantly.Still, its interest coverage ratio of 16.16, its debt-to-revenue ratio of 0.37 and Altman Z-Score of 3.59 are all reasonable and give me no concern about its financial sustainability.ProfitabilityA high profitability ranking for Illumina, 9 out of 10, is based on its operating margin, the trend of the operating margin over the past five years, its Piotroski F-Score, the consistency of its profitability and its predictability ranking.Illumina: A Growth Stock in WaitingThe companys operating margin took a hit in the third quarter of 2021, but has since recovered.Illumina: A Growth Stock in WaitingExcept for that one quarter, it has been relatively consistent over the past 10 years.The Piotroski F-Score is low at just 3 out of 9, and the predictability ranking is middling at three out of five stars. We might say the same of its consistency of profitability.Illumina: A Growth Stock in WaitingGrowthAgain, Illumina scores a ranking of 9 out of 10 for growth. Thats based on its three- and five-year revenue growth rates, the predictability of its five-year revenue growth rate and its five-year Ebitda growth rate.Illumina: A Growth Stock in WaitingThe chart below shows its revenue growth, which has grown consistently in four of the past five years.Illumina: A Growth Stock in WaitingEbitda growth has been more volatile.Illumina: A Growth Stock in WaitingFive-year free cash flow took a beating in 2021, presumably because the company needed to raise $3.1 billion to buy GRAIL.Dividends and share buybacksAs might be expected of a growth company, it pays no dividend and its share count shot up last year to cover the GRAIL deal.ValuationsThe GF Value Line, which is based on historical multiples such as the price-earnings ratio and price-book ratio, as well as an adjustment based on past returns and growth and future estimates of its performance, concludes Illumina is significantly undervalued.Illumina: A Growth Stock in WaitingThe undervaluation is so deep that GuruFocus warns it might be a value trap (a stock that might collapse to nothing). However, we can discount that quickly. The company has cash and cash equivalents of $1.04 billion and ongoing, profitable operations. Its short- and long-term debts of $1.74 billion are relatively small in comparison.The GF Value charts estimated value of $408.82 is almost exactly double the Jan. 2 closing price of $202.20. That suggests a lot of upside potential when (or if) it resolves its issues with the FTC and EU, and the market recovers.GurusGuruFocus shows Illumina shareholders among the gurus include Baillie Gifford (Trades, Portfolio), the Vanguard Health Care Fund (Trades, Portfolio), Ron Baron (Trades, Portfolio), PRIMECAP Management (Trades, Portfolio), Steven Cohen (Trades, Portfolio), Jerome Dodson (Trades, Portfolio), Louis Moore Bacon (Trades, Portfolio), Joel Greenblatt (Trades, Portfolio) and John Hussman (Trades, Portfolio). Institutional investors own 80.34% of the company.Insiders have a 1.92% stake, with CEO Francis DeSouza having the largest slice with 79,443 shares.ConclusionIllumina is a growth stock in waiting, waiting for a resolution of its issues with regulators and with the stock market as a whole.In the meantime, it continues to be a strong performer, with excellent growth and profitability metrics.This article first appeared on GuruFocus.]"

219,6927bc94-3e97-37d0-a427-e3f98e4574b1,CI,2023-01-05,Cigna's (NYSE:CI) earnings growth rate lags the 15% CAGR delivered to shareholders,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/cignas-nyse-ci-earnings-growth-130107786.html,1672923667,STORY,['CI'],"[One simple way to benefit from the stock market is to buy an index fund. But if you pick the right individual stocks, you could make more than that. Just take a look at Cigna Corporation (NYSE:CI), which is up 47%, over three years, soundly beating the market return of 15% (not including dividends). On the other hand, the returns haven't been quite so good recently, with shareholders up just 39% , including dividends .Although Cigna has shed US$6.2b from its market cap this week, let's take a look at its longer term fundamental trends and see if they've driven returns. Check out our latest analysis for Cigna To paraphrase Benjamin Graham: Over the short term the market is a voting machine, but over the long term it's a weighing machine. One way to examine how market sentiment has changed over time is to look at the interaction between a company's share price and its earnings per share (EPS).Cigna was able to grow its EPS at 21% per year over three years, sending the share price higher. The average annual share price increase of 14% is actually lower than the EPS growth. So one could reasonably conclude that the market has cooled on the stock.The company's earnings per share (over time) is depicted in the image below (click to see the exact numbers).earnings-per-share-growthThis free interactive report on Cigna's earnings, revenue and cash flow is a great place to start, if you want to investigate the stock further.What About Dividends?It is important to consider the total shareholder return, as well as the share price return, for any given stock. Whereas the share price return only reflects the change in the share price, the TSR includes the value of dividends (assuming they were reinvested) and the benefit of any discounted capital raising or spin-off. Arguably, the TSR gives a more comprehensive picture of the return generated by a stock. As it happens, Cigna's TSR for the last 3 years was 52%, which exceeds the share price return mentioned earlier. And there's no prize for guessing that the dividend payments largely explain the divergence!Story continuesA Different PerspectiveIt's good to see that Cigna has rewarded shareholders with a total shareholder return of 39% in the last twelve months. And that does include the dividend. Since the one-year TSR is better than the five-year TSR (the latter coming in at 9% per year), it would seem that the stock's performance has improved in recent times. In the best case scenario, this may hint at some real business momentum, implying that now could be a great time to delve deeper. I find it very interesting to look at share price over the long term as a proxy for business performance. But to truly gain insight, we need to consider other information, too. For instance, we've identified   1 warning sign for Cigna  that you should be aware of.For those who like to find winning investments this free list of growing companies with recent insider purchasing, could be just the ticket.Please note, the market returns quoted in this article reflect the market weighted average returns of stocks that currently trade on US exchanges.Have feedback on this article?

With Elite Channel Partner EDRMedeso, Ansys enabled Halodi Robotics to shorten development time by months.Halodi Robotics' humanoid robots will perform jobs such as patrolling buildings at night, stocking grocery shelves, and executing logistical tasks at hospitals.Up until now, robotic machines have only been seen working in factories performing repetitive and precise tasks. With humanoid robots, the most significant difference is that they are capable of interacting with the world just like humans do. To be able to do so, safety is the most important factor for ensuring successful deployment. Halodi Robotics engineers used Ansys to develop motors with enough power to lift heavy packages in a warehouse while simultaneously being gentle enough to retrieve a laptop and hand it to a human colleague.Last spring, Halodi Robotics tested its robot EVE as an assistant to healthcare personnel at Sunnaas Hospital in Norway, executing logistical tasks. The hospital identified that using EVE as an assistant has the potential to free up the approximately 200 hours nurses spend on simple logistics tasks, allowing them to spend more time caring for patients.Story continues""Safety must come first when designing a humanoid robot that will interact with and work among people. Our goal is to engineer a product that is passively safe, making sure that if everything fails, the robot is still harmless,"" said Bernt Øivind Børnich, chief executive officer at Halodi Robotics. ""Simulating the design of powerful yet safe electric motor systems using Ansys software reduced the development time of our second generation of motors by months.""Halodi Robotics engineers used Ansys Motor-CAD simulation software to develop motors that mimic biological systems, such as human muscles. Synthetic fiber threads connected to actuators are driven by very lightweight, low-speed motors with very high torque. These motors provide the high power and low-energy interactions required by humanoid robots.""We're amazed at what Halodi Robotics has been able to accomplish. With the help of Ansys software, engineers are making humanoid robots safe to work around people,"" said Walt Hearn, vice president of worldwide sales and customer excellence at Ansys. ""Moving robots out of confined, structured industrial settings and enabling them to interact with people in real-world settings is a significant leap forward in robotics technology.""To speak with Ansys executives and subject matters and learn more about how customers are leveraging Ansys solutions, visit Ansys at CES in Las Vegas from Jan. 5-8, 2023, at booth #4401./ About AnsysWhen visionary companies need to know how their world-changing ideas will perform, they close the gap between design and reality with Ansys simulation.

Ansys solutions helped enable stronger, lighter, stiffer bike frame geometries that meet ISO safety standards while satisfying competitive cycling and e-bike design requirements. Bianchi's E-Omnia e-bike is on display during CES at Ansys booth #4401.Bianchi used Ansys simulation software to realize a 70% reduction in frame prototyping in the efficient optimization of its road bike and e-bike designs.Designing bicycles that conform to numerous applications or environments presents significant challenges for manufacturers. In the world of competitive cycling, there is considerable demand for bikes that are lighter, stiffer and faster. For e-bikes, suspension components must be lightweight, yet strong enough to withstand pavement impacts. To meet these demands, engineers require an understanding of frame design as it relates to material stiffness, weight, component integration, and the aerodynamics of rider and bike in a variety of environments.Bianchi used Ansys' multiphysics capabilities to understand the impact of frame geometry on overall performance. Within Ansys® SpaceClaim®, Bianchi used a dynamic 3D model of rider position in combination with drivetrain efficiency data to make predictions about what levels of power and performance can be expected during time trials or specific stages of a competitive race. Ansys® Mechanical™ also helped engineers understand and identify the level of suspension e-bike kinematics needed to withstand hard pavement yet conform with lighter component materials — often revealing interesting mechanical properties that led to new design ideas.Story continues""One of the biggest discoveries we made during testing was that frame stiffness is dependent on the geometrical harmony between all the tubes of the frame, including the top tube, which we had previously overlooked,"" said Marco Borgonovo, head of product at Bianchi. ""It's just one of many examples of how using Ansys simulation helped us to understand which parts of the frame really influence aerodynamic performance — where it makes sense to work more and optimize more, rather than stick to conventional wisdom and dismiss the importance of the top tube altogether.""""The role of bicycles has evolved beyond recreation to green transportation,"" said Walt Hearn, vice president of worldwide sales and customer excellence at Ansys. ""This shift reflects a preference for ergonomic designs influenced by lower drag, lighter frames and greater performance. Using Ansys simulation solutions helps our customers efficiently work through large design challenges like these with fewer prototypes, saving them time, effort and costs on the way to something new.""Visit Ansys at CES in Las Vegas from Jan. 5-8, 2023, at booth #4401 to see Bianchi's e-bike, E Omnia, on display and learn more./ About AnsysWhen visionary companies need to know how their world-changing ideas will perform, they close the gap between design and reality with Ansys simulation.

Pfizer (PFE), which belongs to the Zacks Large Cap Pharmaceuticals industry, could be a great candidate to consider.When looking at the last two reports, this drugmaker has recorded a strong streak of surpassing earnings estimates. The company has topped estimates by 18.83%, on average, in the last two quarters.For the most recent quarter, Pfizer was expected to post earnings of $1.47 per share, but it reported $1.78 per share instead, representing a surprise of 21.09%. For the previous quarter, the consensus estimate was $1.75 per share, while it actually produced $2.04 per share, a surprise of 16.57%.Price and EPS SurpriseFor Pfizer, estimates have been trending higher, thanks in part to this earnings surprise history. And when you look at the stock's positive Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction), it's a great indicator of a future earnings beat, especially when combined with its solid Zacks Rank.Our research shows that stocks with the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time. In other words, if you have 10 stocks with this combination, the number of stocks that beat the consensus estimate could be as high as seven.The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is related to change. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Pfizer currently has an Earnings ESP of +3.06%, which suggests that analysts have recently become bullish on the company's earnings prospects. This positive Earnings ESP when combined with the stock's Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) indicates that another beat is possibly around the corner. We expect the company's next earnings report to be released on January 31, 2023.Story continuesWith the Earnings ESP metric, it's important to note that a negative value reduces its predictive power; however, a negative Earnings ESP does not indicate an earnings miss.Many companies end up beating the consensus EPS estimate, though this is not the only reason why their shares gain. Additionally, some stocks may remain stable even if they end up missing the consensus estimate.Because of this, it's really important to check a company's Earnings ESP ahead of its quarterly release to increase the odds of success.

Therefore, investors should consider paying close attention to these earnings surprises, as a big beat can help a stock climb even higher.2 Stocks to Add to Your WatchlistThe Zacks Earnings ESP, or Expected Surprise Prediction, aims to find earnings surprises by focusing on the most recent analyst revisions. The basic premise is that if an analyst reevaluates their earnings estimate ahead of an earnings release, it means they likely have new information that could possibly be more accurate. The core of the ESP model is comparing the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate, where the resulting percentage difference between the two equals the Expected Surprise Prediction.The last thing we will do today, now that we have a grasp on the ESP and how powerful of a tool it can be, is to look at a qualifying stock. Pfizer (PFE) holds a Zacks Rank #3 at the moment and its Most Accurate Estimate comes in at $1.12 a share 27 days away from its upcoming earnings release on January 31, 2023.By taking the percentage difference between the $1.12 Most Accurate Estimate and the $1.09 Zacks Consensus Estimate, Pfizer has an Earnings ESP of 3.06%.PFE is just one of a large group of Medical stocks with a positive ESP figure.

The program is designed to fuel growth for new and existing partners, including resellers, hyperscalers, technology providers, independent software vendors and systems integrators, by putting them in control of their earning potential. IBM Partner Plus is central to the company's Hybrid Cloud and AI strategy and aims to empower partners to help clients automate, secure and modernize their businesses.IBM Corporation logo.IBM Partner Plus offers partners a transparent, simple and modern experience. By growing technical expertise and demonstrating sales success, participants can progress to three tiers - Silver, Gold and Platinum - which unlock specialized financial, go-to-market support and education benefits. In the new program, badging will become the standardized measure of skills and validated solutions will demonstrate expertise. The enhanced IBM Partner Portal consolidates and tracks all expertise, revenue and deals globally, offering each partner a clear line-of-site into their progression through the program.""IBM Partner Plus introduces a new way for IBM to deliver value to new and existing partners by helping them gain skills, grow faster and earn more,"" said Kate Woolley, General Manager, IBM Ecosystem. ""We've heard from partners that they want a simplified experience that helps them win with clients. I'm confident these changes and our continued investment in our ecosystem will make IBM the partner of choice across the industry, and together we can drive growth for partners, clients, and IBM.""IBM Partner Plus results from the company's journey to put partners at the center of IBM's go-to-market strategy and act as a growth engine to help capture the $1 trillion hybrid cloud and AI market opportunities. IBM has invested in elevating the role of partners and accelerating partner-led sales by enabling the ecosystem to become a preferred route to market, offering clients an optimal mix of technology, services and consulting expertise. To drive continued growth, IBM will increase its capacity to support partners by doubling the number of partner-facing brand and technical specialists to help them prospect and win additional client business.Story continues""The new IBM Partner Plus program provides an enhanced experience that sets our company up for success by offering employees access to skills and opportunities, so we can help more clients utilize IBM's technology portfolio to modernize their operations,"" said Bo Gebbie, President, Evolving Solutions. ""IBM is more serious than ever about putting partners first. They've listened to our feedback, and it is reflected in the new partner experience that makes it easy for us to collaborate, rewards our investments and fuel growth.""IBM Partner Plus brings all partner types and programs together – whether they sell, build on or with, and/or provide services for IBM technology – into one integrated ecosystem. For example, to help broaden the market opportunity and create new revenue streams for its ecosystem, IBM recently enabled partners in North America to resell IBM products through other cloud marketplaces. This allows for independent software vendors to embed IBM Software from partner marketplaces into their own solutions. All partner sales through the marketplace accumulate towards their progression in IBM Partner Plus.Competitive incentivesPartners can advance through tiers to unlock benefits and demand generation programs which could offer them up to a threefold increase in total investment from IBM. The IBM Partner Portal gives partners real-time visibility into the incentives they are eligible for, predictability into potential earnings and includes an automated deal share engine that helps them surface quality leads. This has improved deal registration and introduced partners to more than 7,000 potential deals valued at over half a billion dollars globally.* IBM investments in co-marketing campaigns and co-sell support with partners can also help bring solutions to market and generate demand.Insider accessIBM Partner Plus builds on the successful release of its October badging and selling enablement materials to partners, which has driven more than 15,000 partner enrollments in sales and technical badges. Offering partners the training, enablement, and experiential selling resources available to IBMers at no cost can help better equip them to win with clients. Additionally, access to IBM's seller tools can help them generate competitive and transparent pricing. Partners can also attend IBM's quarterly Sales Kickoffs together with IBM sellers and participate in live training sessions and other global technical advocacy events to help upskill, increase eminence, and engage with technical experts. For new partners, IBM is launching the IBM New Partner Accelerator, which provides onboarding, training and other benefits during their first six months in the program to help accelerate their path to profitability.Enhanced support and benefitsPartners can grow skills, develop solutions and build sales expertise with technologies like AI, security and cloud on an open hybrid cloud platform by leveraging technical experts from IBM. IBM will also assist partners in the development of minimal viable products, proofs of concept, and custom demos to help them win client business and accelerate growth. In addition, as partner businesses grow with IBM, they can unlock additional benefits designed to help them expand capabilities and find new clients.PartnerWorld will transition to a new IBM Partner Plus experience on January 4, 2023, with the new incentive program taking effect on April 1, 2023. Registered PartnerWorld members will maintain their current tier through July 1, 2023 and can progress to the new tiering system during this time as they meet criteria.For more details on IBM Partner Plus, please visit: https://www.ibm.com/partnerplus/Statements regarding IBM's future direction and intent are subject to change or withdrawal without notice and represent goals and objectives only.*Proprietary metrics obtained from IBM sales data, January 2022–August 2022Media ContactLowell Eschenlowell.eschen@ibm.com SOURCE IBM]"

TRC's offer price is approximately 4.33% lower than the closing price of MPC's common stock on December 16, 2022, the last trading day prior to its stated commencement of the offer.MPC is not associated in any way with TRC or its mini-tender offer. MPC recommends that shareholders not tender their shares in response to TRC's unsolicited offer because the price of $105.00 is below the current market price for MPC's shares.TRC has made similar mini-tender offers for shares of other companies. Mini-tender offers, such as this one by TRC, avoid many of the investor protections afforded by larger tender offers, including the filing of disclosure and other tender offer documents with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and other procedures mandated by U.S. securities laws.The SEC has issued ""Tips for Investors"" regarding mini-tender offers, noting that some bidders, in making the offers at below-market prices, are ""hoping that they will catch investors off guard if the investors do not compare the offer price to the current market price.""

Its unique expertise in dealer and vendor financing programs provides valuable solutions to industries with increasing growth in capital spending, such as IT services, office equipment, and 3D print.PEAC Solutions is a portfolio company of the Asset Value Funds sponsored and managed by leading global investment firm HPS Investment Partners.Under the Forward Funding Agreement, FITTLE has the option to sell eligible pools of lease receivables, which PEAC Solutions is committed to purchase on a monthly basis. FITTLE will continue to service the lease receivables for a specified fee and will be paid a commission on lease receivables sold. The Forward Funding Agreement primarily covers U.S. direct originations and has an initial term of one-year, with automatic one-year extensions thereafter, unless terminated by either party. FITTLE expects to sell lease receivables, which would otherwise have been funded by Xerox, totaling approximately $600 million during the initial term.""Since FITTLE's inception, we have been dedicated to being a best-in-class provider of leasing services and solutions, and this strategic shift in our business model will drive our next phase of growth. With the majority of our future origination volume expected to be funded by third parties, we can expand the financing of our valued business customers and partners, and free up capital for Xerox,"" said FITTLE's President Nicole Torraco.""Our new strategic partnership with FITTLE demonstrates PEAC Solutions’ innovative leasing capabilities, identifying us as a leading partner to both vendors and captive finance providers.

Xerox coupled this new funding solution with an opportunity to reduce the commitments under its revolving credit facility by 50 percent and eliminate its quarter-end minimum liquidity requirement.

Let's talk more about auto sales. They're expected to hit that number he just mentioned. 13.9 million for '22. That's an 8% decline from the year prior, well below that pre-pandemic average, which was around 17 million. Here to discuss that as well as GM and the passing lane right by Toyota is Pat Ryan, the founder and CEO of CoPilot, which helps consumers buy new and used cars. Good to see you, sir. What do you make of that dynamic as GM increases sales and Toyota falls off more than 9%, or the fact that we're looking at is this a new norm of auto sales in that 13 to 14 million units?PAT RYAN: There's still a lot of pent up demand. If you look at it, Toyota has almost no supply on the ground. Toyota and Lexus combined have about 21 days worth of cars on their lots. So they're still in very high demand. They just don't have the supply. Japanese automakers overall have really struggled to catch up on the chip side and struggled to keep up with the demand. Their cars have been very high demand throughout the pandemic, where GM supplies caught up. GM supplies up quite a bit. It's closer to 60 days.And so GM's really come back in its supply. That's allowed them to sell in ways that Toyota hasn't been able to. So if Toyota can produce and get caught up to GM on the production side, I would expect to see that race be more neck and neck than it was at the end of this year. Toyota just lost too much ground in the middle of the year, unable to keep production up. And you see it with their market today. If you buy a Toyota in the fourth quarter, they only gave you one key because they couldn't import enough chips to give you two keys.Story continues- Pat, let's compare what's going on in the new car market and comparing that with the used car market because pricing, especially in the used car market, we've seen that come down pretty substantially. You sent over numbers in that the average price of a used car was $31,000. That's down 6% year over year. When you take a look at pricing-- let's start there-- do you expect that to trend even lower this year, and how low?PAT RYAN: We do. It's an interesting. The markets are all different. So if you look at the older used cars, they started to really come down at the beginning of the year. They've been dropping all year. They're down considerably. And they saw a really big decline in those prices that slowed in the fourth quarter. Where the substitute for new cars, those one to three-year-old nearly new used cars, those really didn't start to slow until August. They actually peaked in August. So we've seen a big drop in those numbers. Those numbers are really moving down dramatically in the fourth quarter as new car supply has come back.New car supply is up over 70% from its low in the summer. And that's going to accelerate as people begin to continue to struggle, I think, a little bit with the interest rate payments. The Toyota management said that they're seeing for the first time cars they thought were pre-sold that aren't closing because people look at the interest rates and say, maybe not. And those used car prices are starting to soften because of it. And we expect that to accelerate as we get into '23.- And Seana mentions that 6% decline. Nothing compared to the EV drop off, four times that, 24%. And Tesla's down 25%. What do you make of that drop off of a cliff?PAT RYAN: Well, it's interesting. The Tesla vehicle price, the vehicle price and the Tesla stock price seem to have had an equally tumultuous year. The electric prices really took off when the Ukraine war started. And we saw a huge increase that peaked in the summer. And then since then, we've seen a huge drop off, 25% down, in terms of what used Teslas have gone down, which is interesting because new Teslas, price has been going up because of the scarcity of battery-related minerals and the ability to just get production of electric vehicles as high as they'd like.So the reality is that the Tesla bubble sort of peaked this summer and then popped. But it's not just that the prices have come down. Even though prices have come down 25%, what we're looking at is near record high supply of used Teslas on the market. It's hard to imagine with new Tesla prices going up that that's not going to put some real pressure the Tesla stock because the difference in a two-year-old Tesla is hard to say it's worth $25,000 or $30,000.- Certainly. I do agree with that. Pat, you at CoPilot, you help people. You help potential buyers get the best deal, whether they're buying a new or used car. If some of our viewers are in the market, I guess what are one, two, or three tips that you have or they need to keep in mind when they are purchasing their next vehicle?PAT RYAN: Yeah. I think it's really important to really shop around and be patient. Both the new car supply is going up. Incentives reached record lows in the middle of this year for new cars. They're going up. But they're down 71% year over year. So you're going to see incentives climb throughout '23. You're going to see availability climb for new cars throughout '23. And you're going to see used car prices on the other side drop throughout '23.So this is a great time to be patient, a great time to shop around. That's why we tell our members, hey, we'll look at every dealer in the country for you and find you the ones who are really adjusting to the market because no one wants to be that person who's the last one to pay the record high price. And there's risk of that. There's a lot of diffusion in the market in terms of what prices look like. A lot of dealers trying to hold on for the old profits. And consumers need to be savvy about that.I think the second one to keep in mind is-- first one is on used cars. Definitely wait for the incentives on used cars. Wait for prices to come down more. They're accelerating. All these forces are coming your way. After two years of being a dealer and automaker market, it's now going to become a consumer market in '23. The last one is if you have a trade in and you're trade in is a lot of equity, that may be the one reason to buy sooner because with those used car prices going down are going to impact the price and value of your trade in.So that'd be the only reason to buy now is if you have a trade in with a lot of equity. Maybe that makes it better to get a new car right now. That's probably the best combo is to sell a-- trade in a used car and buy a new car right now. Otherwise, patience will be your friend. And you'll see people-- it's like the stock market. I expect that '23-- as we get into mid to late '23, we're going to see that the car market prices have adjusted the way the stock market has. And being patient will pay off for consumers who do.- Don't want to rush to any big decisions there. Pat Ryan, CoPilot CEO, thanks so much for joining us here this afternoon.]"

And GM has reclaimed its title as a top seller in the US. Sales for 2022 totaling 2.27 million. That's up 2 and 1/2 percent from what we saw a year ago and pushing shares higher today. Look at that, the stock closing up just about 2 and 1/2 percent.And Pras Subramanian here with more on this. And Pras, I guess, good news for GM, but overall clearly a challenging year for the auto industry?PRAS SUBRMANIAN: Yeah, for sure. GM, good news there. They're number one overall America, number one in total truck sales, a number of things like that, up 2.5% last year sales-wise, up 41% in Q4. So sort of reflecting that they really had an improvement compared to last year with all the chip shortages and things like that.So Toyota there, their rival, you see there, 2.1, so barely missing out, but down 9.6%. They were really hit this year with those parts shortages, chip shortages. They've cut their outlook a couple of times last year, so not a good year for them. But still, 2.1 million nothing to sneeze at there.Looking at it, GM actually sees that their ICE and gas-powered businesses actually will see potential sales of-- across the industry of $15 million to-- from $14.1 million last year. So they see the actual gas business growing overall for the industry. And then EVs of course, they upped their Bolt production to 70,000 per year. They have three new EVs come out next year. And their Factory Zero all-EV plant opens mid-next year too. So a lot going on for GM as well.DAVE BRIGGS: Just remarkable, that split though, in year over year between GM and Toyota, wow. All right, broader expectations across the industry as the '22 numbers roll in, what are you thinking?PRAS SUBRMANIAN: Yeah, as we get more and more these numbers-- Ford tomorrow-- then the industry will put together their sort of projection for what 2022 was. So we're looking at ""Edmunds"" here, looking at a number of around what 13.9-- sorry, Cox Auto, 13.9 million for 2022. That's down 8% from last year, down 20% from peak levels in like 2015-2016.So we're not going to see these days before of 17 million units sold in a year. Those days are over. Automakers are sort of seeing the numbers and higher prices, price inflation, higher rates. We're never going to see those days, at least for a long time. And right now, it's more about can you sell cars at a decent margin, make money, and not sell as much?DAVE BRIGGS: Yeah, auto dealers really liked that COVID dynamic, right? They didn't have a lot of inventory, but the prices were sky high, and they didn't have to have a lot of employees. It all worked out well for them. Pras, good to see you. Thank you.]"

This lead to analyst like JPMorgan’s Ryan Brinkman to cut his price target to $125 from $150.""Beyond the impact to near-term financials, another implication we see from 4Q’s combination of softer than consensus volume and pricing is the impact on the stock’s growth narrative which has allowed many investors to believe the company is likely to grow [unit volumes],"" Brinkman said in a note to clients yesterday. ""We have questioned the company’s ability to sustain this rate of growth.""Brinkman’s concern is one echoed on Wall Street, where analysts are questioning whether Tesla can maintain its long-term delivery growth rate target of 50% compound annual growth. If that growth rate can’t be maintained, Tesla’s high valuation will have to come down to mirror traditional automakers, who have had much more modest growth, and smaller profit margins.Story continuesIn a note today to investors, Wedbush’s Dan Ives laid out that demand concern, writing that yesterday’s delivery numbers leave “investors with more questions than answers on the Tesla story with global demand.”And while Ives believes investors shouldn’t bail on Tesla just yet, he does note it is a “fork in the road” moment for Tesla—and Musk must go into damage control mode now to lay out a realistic vision for growth, or more “brutal pain” is to come for already scarred long-term investors.—Pras Subramanian is a reporter for Yahoo Finance.

Wall Street clearly dives into all of the other metrics and management's input, but the EPS figure helps cut through all the noise.The earnings figure itself is key, but a beat or miss on the bottom line can sometimes be just as, if not more, important. Therefore, investors should consider paying close attention to these earnings surprises, as a big beat can help a stock climb even higher.2 Stocks to Add to Your WatchlistThe Zacks Expected Surprise Prediction, or ESP, works by locking in on the most up-to-date analyst earnings revisions because they can be more accurate than estimates from weeks or even months before the actual release date. The thinking is pretty straightforward: analysts who provide earnings estimates closer to the report are likely to have more information. With this in mind, the Expected Surprise Prediction compares the Most Accurate Estimate (being the most recent) against the overall Zacks Consensus Estimate. The percentage difference provides the ESP figure.Now that we understand what the ESP is and how beneficial it can be, let's dive into a stock that currently fits the bill. United Parcel Service (UPS) earns a Zacks Rank #3 right now and its Most Accurate Estimate sits at $3.64 a share, just 27 days from its upcoming earnings release on January 31, 2023.UPS has an Earnings ESP figure of 1.5%, which, as explained above, is calculated by taking the percentage difference between the $3.64 Most Accurate Estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $3.59.UPS is part of a big group of Transportation stocks that boast a positive ESP, and investors may want to take a look at United Airlines (UAL) as well.United Airlines, which is readying to report earnings on January 18, 2023, sits at a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) right now. It's Most Accurate Estimate is currently $2.23 a share, and UAL is 14 days out from its next earnings report.Story continuesUnited Airlines' Earnings ESP figure currently stands at 4.59% after taking the percentage difference between its Most Accurate Estimate and its Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.13.Because both stocks hold a positive Earnings ESP, UPS and UAL could potentially post earnings beats in their next reports.Find Stocks to Buy or Sell Before They're ReportedUse the Zacks Earnings ESP Filter to turn up stocks with the highest probability of positively, or negatively, surprising to buy or sell before they're reported for profitable earnings season trading.

But the results of PNC's recent Economic Outlook survey indicates that the majority of women business owners (WBOs) already have more confidence than men in the same roles. That goes hand-in-hand with PNC's drive to help WBO's realize equitable access to opportunities and capital and shrinking the gender pay gap.There's no question that current economic conditions - including supply chain disruptions and political and geopolitical uncertainties - have tempered optimism for business owners across the board. But four in 10 WBOs reported feeling highly optimistic about their own businesses, and more than eight in 10 were very confident in their future success. Perhaps most important, at least to me, is that nearly half of the respondents indicated that their confidence comes from their own hard work and drive.This is the second time in as many years that WBOs have cited their own resilience as the source of their confidence. It appears that the same adaptability and flexibility that went into ensuring their businesses survived the pandemic is the source of their self-assurance and optimism today.Last year's survey showed that nearly half (49%) of women-owned businesses reported their business was operating differently than pre-pandemic, compared to 38% of men-owned businesses (MBOs). Many of the changes implemented by WBOs were on behalf of their employees, and they remain more likely than their men-owned counterparts to continue or accelerate those actions, including offering flexible work arrangements (48%), increased compensation (38%), and employee health or safety enhancements (33%).The adaptability and willingness to embrace change in the face of a transforming labor market has left WBOs better equipped to manage staffing challenges. Fewer WBOs (30%) than MBOs (43%) were finding it hard to hire new staff and when they did confront shortages, more women (49%) than men (33%) were willing to jump in to cover open staff hours themselves. This willingness to support employees is also reflected in McKinsey &amp; Company's Women in the Workplace 2022. According to the report, compared to men at their level, women leaders do more to support employee well-being and foster diversity, equity and inclusion-work that dramatically improves retention and employee satisfaction but is not formally rewarded in most companies. For women who own a company, employee well-being is its own reward.Story continuesAnd the survey result that really excites me? For the first time, we have evidence of increased financial confidence among WBOs: they are twice as likely as men to say they're considering a new loan or line of credit to support business growth. They're also investing excess cash rather than stockpiling it, and confidently increasing pricing as the economy allows for it.Women-owned businesses currently represent about 40% of all small businesses in the U.S., and women continue to turn to business ownership for a number of reasons - including work flexibility and the chance to build wealth on their own terms. As PNC's most recent survey shows, women are not only holding their own as entrepreneurs, but they are out-performing men counterparts in creating positive workplaces. Their consistent and growing optimism for the future of their own businesses bodes well for the economy as a whole - and hopefully moves us closer to the end of the 257-year economic gender gap.View additional multimedia and more ESG storytelling from PNC Financial Services Group on 3blmedia.com.Contact Info:Spokesperson: PNC Financial Services GroupWebsite: http://threeblpro.prod.acquia-sites.com/dashboard/pnc-financial-services-groupEmail: info@3blmedia.comSOURCE: PNC Financial Services GroupView source version on accesswire.com: https://www.accesswire.com/733975/Women-Business-Owners-Dont-Need-to-Become-Confident-They-Already-Are]"

PNC recently overtook the 50-day moving average, and this suggests a short-term bullish trend.The 50-day simple moving average, which is one of three major moving averages, is widely used by traders and analysts to establish support and resistance levels for a range of securities. Because it's the first sign of an up or down trend, the 50-day is considered to be more important.PNC has rallied 5% over the past four weeks, and the company is a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) at the moment. This combination suggests PNC could be on the verge of another move higher.Looking at PNC's earnings estimate revisions, investors will be even more convinced of the bullish uptrend. There have been 1 higher compared to none lower for the current fiscal year, and the consensus estimate has moved up as well.Investors may want to watch PNC for more gains in the near future given the company's key technical level and positive earnings estimate revisions.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

This factor can impact your investment portfolio as well as help you compare investment results across sectors and industries.The fear of missing out, or FOMO, also plays a factor in investing, especially with particular tech giants, as well as popular consumer-facing stocks.What if you'd invested in The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc (PNC) ten years ago? It may not have been easy to hold on to PNC for all that time, but if you did, how much would your investment be worth today?The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc's Business In-DepthWith that in mind, let's take a look at The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc's main business drivers.Headquartered in Pittsburgh and incepted in 1983, The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. provides consumer and business banking services. The company's principal subsidiary is PNC Bank.PNC Financial reports mainly through three business segments. Retail Banking provides deposit, lending, brokerage, insurance services, investment management, and cash management products and services to consumer and small business customers through a coast-to-coast branch network, automated telling machines (ATMs), call centers, and online &amp; mobile banking channels.Corporate and Institutional Banking segment provides lending, treasury management, and capital markets-related products and services to mid-sized and large corporations, government and not-for-profit entities.Asset Management Group provides a wide range of wealth management products and services to individuals and their families, multi-generational family planning services to ultra-high net worth clients through the PNC Private Bank. Institutional asset management operating unit serves as an investment manager and trustee for companies, non-profit organizations and retirement plans across the country.In September 2022, the company closed the buyout of Linga, a point of sale (POS) and payment solutions firm in a bid to expand corporate payments capabilities in the hospitality and restaurant industry space.On Oct 12, 2021, PNC Financial completed the conversion of consumers, employees and branches across seven states from BBVA USA to PNC Bank. The acquisition of BBVA USA Bancshares Inc. and its U.S. banking subsidiary, BBVA USA was closed in June 2021. The company shelled out $11.5 billion in cash for the acquisition, and added $82.2 billion of deposits and $60.5 billion of loans to its balance sheet.Story continuesIn April 2017, PNC Financial acquired U.S.-based commercial and vendor finance business of ECN Capital Corp in an all-cash transaction valued at $1.1 billion.As of Sep 30, 2022, PNC Financial reported $559.5 billion in assets, $315.4 billion in loans, $438.2 billion in deposits and $46.7 billion in shareholders' equity.Bottom LineAnyone can invest, but building a successful investment portfolio requires research, patience, and a little bit of risk. So, if you had invested in The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc ten years ago, you're likely feeling pretty good about your investment today.A $1000 investment made in January 2013 would be worth $2,669.79, or a 166.98% gain, as of January 4, 2023, according to our calculations. Investors should note that this return excludes dividends but includes price increases.In comparison, the S&amp;P 500 gained 162.04% and the price of gold went up 6.62% over the same time frame.Going forward, analysts are expecting more upside for PNC.Shares of PNC Financial have outperformed the industry in the past year. The company's earnings have surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in the trailing four quarters. Higher net interest income (NII) and loan growth, and declining expenses, aided its third-quarter results. Higher loan and deposit balance, along with decent pipelines, are expected to support balance-sheet strength. PNC Financial’s NII and margins are well-poised to benefit from rising interest rates. Inorganic expansion strategies have diversified the business mix. Sound capital deployment activities, backed by decent liquidity, are other positives. However, mounting expenses due to accelerated investment spend and integration costs will likely keep denting the bottom line in the near term. Significant exposure to commercial loans can be risky in competitive markets.The stock has jumped 5.04% over the past four weeks. Additionally, no earnings estimate has gone lower in the past two months, compared to 1 higher, for fiscal 2022; the consensus estimate has moved up as well.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

273,58d5311c-b926-387b-a11d-e4d0f300b76d,TGT,2023-01-05,Should You Think About Buying Target Corporation (NYSE:TGT) Now?,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/think-buying-target-corporation-nyse-120029042.html,1672920029,STORY,['TGT'],"[Let's talk about the popular Target Corporation (NYSE:TGT). The company's shares saw significant share price movement during recent months on the NYSE, rising to highs of US$179 and falling to the lows of US$141. Some share price movements can give investors a better opportunity to enter into the stock, and potentially buy at a lower price. A question to answer is whether Target's current trading price of US$153 reflective of the actual value of the large-cap? Or is it currently undervalued, providing us with the opportunity to buy? Let’s take a look at Target’s outlook and value based on the most recent financial data to see if there are any catalysts for a price change. Check out our latest analysis for Target What's The Opportunity In Target?The share price seems sensible at the moment according to my price multiple model, where I compare the company's price-to-earnings ratio to the industry average. I’ve used the price-to-earnings ratio in this instance because there’s not enough visibility to forecast its cash flows. The stock’s ratio of 20.39x is currently trading slightly above its industry peers’ ratio of 16.62x, which means if you buy Target today, you’d be paying a relatively reasonable price for it. And if you believe that Target should be trading at this level in the long run, then there should only be a fairly immaterial downside vs other industry peers. Although, there may be an opportunity to buy in the future. This is because Target’s beta (a measure of share price volatility) is high, meaning its price movements will be exaggerated relative to the rest of the market. If the market is bearish, the company’s shares will likely fall by more than the rest of the market, providing a prime buying opportunity.What kind of growth will Target generate?earnings-and-revenue-growthInvestors looking for growth in their portfolio may want to consider the prospects of a company before buying its shares. Buying a great company with a robust outlook at a cheap price is always a good investment, so let’s also take a look at the company's future expectations. With profit expected to grow by 57% over the next couple of years, the future seems bright for Target. It looks like higher cash flow is on the cards for the stock, which should feed into a higher share valuation.Story continuesWhat This Means For YouAre you a shareholder? TGT’s optimistic future growth appears to have been factored into the current share price, with shares trading around industry price multiples. However, there are also other important factors which we haven’t considered today, such as the financial strength of the company. Have these factors changed since the last time you looked at TGT? Will you have enough conviction to buy should the price fluctuate below the industry PE ratio?Are you a potential investor? If you’ve been keeping tabs on TGT, now may not be the most optimal time to buy, given it is trading around industry price multiples. However, the positive outlook is encouraging for TGT, which means it’s worth diving deeper into other factors such as the strength of its balance sheet, in order to take advantage of the next price drop.If you want to dive deeper into Target, you'd also look into what risks it is currently facing.

Going to buy from hold with a new price target of $160 a share there from that analyst Anna Andreeva. And basically saying that the company has been underperforming, but its model is proving to be sticky in keeping pandemic gains.So that's part of what the thesis is here is that-- you know, remember we had that whole discussion about how Etsy had a mask boom, right? Everybody was selling masks on Etsy. And the concern was the pandemic is over, people aren't buying-- well, it's not over but people are not buying masks in the same quantity that they were. Oh, that's gonna be a problem for Etsy. And I think her argument is that people actually hung around and kept buying stuff.BRAD SMITH: I mean, they're gonna have to do something on the front to really kind of prop up the seller environment on Etsy even more so. They've been investing heavily into that, trying to enhance the customer experience across the marketplace. Trying to retain, grow out the buyer base as well. And it's kind of all part of this right-to-win strategy that they've rolled out.But I mean, you look at the most recent quarter. You did see GMS, the Gross Merchandise Sales, actually down 3.3% year-over-year. So it's gonna come against some tough comps as well in not just the next quarter that they report for but perhaps next year as we start to-- or this year, rather, as we start to get into some of the comparisons against when they did see that pandemic boom. Perhaps, it'll be a little bit more favorable.BRIAN SOZZI: And very important point. Anna mentions in here that Etsy is exiting the pandemic in a stronger position, arguably then when it went into the pandemic. And compare that to what we saw with these other pandemic plays, like a Peloton. They are an absolute disaster right now.Story continuesAnd I think that's a nice nod to Josh Silverman, the CEO of Etsy, longtime CEO. He has run a very-- just he's done a very good job throughout the pandemic. You don't see him-- or you haven't seen him make a lot of mistakes operationally over the past three years.JULIE HYMAN: Yeah, although there was some buyer pushback at some fee--BRIAN SOZZI: YesJULIE HYMAN: --increases. That was something that got some attention for the company.]"

Both of those are moving off of rating changes this morning. First, let's take a look at TGT. This follows a downgrade from overweight to equal weight by Wells Fargo, as the bank is also slashing its price target on the retail giant from $170 down to $142 here. And so there, you're taking a look at what's kind of change there in the mix.But again, the consumer discretionary environment far different, I think, for the different categories that Target has tried to move through some of their inventory, especially where consumers have pushed back because they probably don't need another laptop or they don't need one of the consumer electronics devices, where they face some of those issues. It's also in the apparel category. These other discretionary categories at Target, that's gonna be one to watch as they continue to give us some more insights into how they're performing.BRIAN SOZZI: Right, I just put my serious posture on and my face on because this is a serious call on target by Ed Kelly over at Wells Fargo. Saying, ""Target's outlook has deteriorated meaningfully and we no longer see it as an attractive investment into an uncertain 2023."" That is a big call.You don't make calls like that lightly, having been in that seat with Ed. You know, that is a type of call that you risk just damaging your relation-- damaging your relationship with the company. But him, I guess, he has seen enough in those November, December channel checks at retail.And I've seen it, too. A lot of inventory building up, notably in toys, that he sees potentially another earnings miss from Target when they report in the middle of February. That would be the third straight earnings miss from a Target, in addition to maybe he sees another warning for the balance of this year.JULIE HYMAN: Yeah.]"

Unfortunately, these high risk investments often have little probability of ever paying off, and many investors pay a price to learn their lesson. A loss-making company is yet to prove itself with profit, and eventually the inflow of external capital may dry up.So if this idea of high risk and high reward doesn't suit, you might be more interested in profitable, growing companies, like Visa (NYSE:V). Now this is not to say that the company presents the best investment opportunity around, but profitability is a key component to success in business. View our latest analysis for Visa How Fast Is Visa Growing?The market is a voting machine in the short term, but a weighing machine in the long term, so you'd expect share price to follow earnings per share (EPS) outcomes eventually. That makes EPS growth an attractive quality for any company. We can see that in the last three years Visa grew its EPS by 10% per year. That growth rate is fairly good, assuming the company can keep it up.Careful consideration of revenue growth and earnings before interest and taxation (EBIT) margins can help inform a view on the sustainability of the recent profit growth. EBIT margins for Visa remained fairly unchanged over the last year, however the company should be pleased to report its revenue growth for the period of 22% to US$29b. That's progress.In the chart below, you can see how the company has grown earnings and revenue, over time.

But we are reassured by the fact they have invested in the company. Notably, they have an enviable stake in the company, worth US$229m. We note that this amounts to 0.05% of the company, which may be small owing to the sheer size of Visa but it's still worth mentioning. So despite their percentage holding being low, company management still have plenty of reasons to deliver the best outcomes for investors.Story continuesDoes Visa Deserve A Spot On Your Watchlist?One positive for Visa is that it is growing EPS. That's nice to see. For those who are looking for a little more than this, the high level of insider ownership enhances our enthusiasm for this growth. The combination definitely favoured by investors so consider keeping the company on a watchlist. It is worth noting though that we have found 1 warning sign for Visa that you need to take into consideration.There's always the possibility of doing well buying stocks that are not growing earnings and do not have insiders buying shares.

U.S. Treasury yields fell sharply after the minutes to a three-week low.Still, the Fed minutes also showed that policymakers were hyper focused on bringing down inflation, and are set to keep U.S. interest rates higher for longer. Such a scenario is likely to limit gains in metal markets.Spot gold rose slightly to $1,855.45 an ounce, while gold futures steadied around $1,860.80 an ounce by 19:26 ET (00:26 GMT), reaching their highest level since mid-June. Both instruments logged a strong start to 2023, and are up nearly 2% over the past two sessions.Bullion prices were also boosted by increased safe haven demand for assets apart from the dollar, especially after a warning from the International Monetary Fund that the world’s largest economies face a potential recession in 2023.But broader metal markets slipped on the prospect of a global economic slowdown. Among industrial metals, copper prices crept lower and were headed for a third straight day of losses, following a dismal start to the new year.Copper futures fell 0.1% in early Asian trade to $3.7412 a pound, and are trading down nearly 2% since their last close in 2022.Uncertainty over an economic reopening in China weighed heavily on the red metal, as the world’s largest copper importer faces an overwhelming spike in COVID-19 infections.While copper demand is expected to recover eventually as the Chinese economy reopens, prices are set for more near-term volatility as the timeline for said reopening remains unclear.Story continuesSigns of slowing business activity in other major economies also weighed on industrial metals. U.S. manufacturing activity shrank for a second straight month in December, data showed on Wednesday, furthering fears of an economic slowdown in the country.Nickel prices plummeted 6% after the U.S. reading, while the prices of precious metals with industrial applications, such as platinum and silver, also declined.Related ArticlesGold nears 7-month high as Fed minutes indicate slower rate hikesVenezuela's lack of dredging causes trouble for Chevron's heavy oil exportsOil falls more than 5% on global economy worry, China COVID cases]"

SWK has failed to impress investors with its recent operational performance due to weakness in its Tools &amp; Outdoor segment, persistent supply-chain constraints, raw material cost inflation and foreign-currency headwinds. These factors may adversely impede its earnings in the near term.Let’s discuss the factors that might continue taking a toll on the firm.Weak Segmental Performance: Softness in the Tools &amp; Outdoor segment due to reduced retail and consumer demand is weighing on Stanley Black’s performance. The segment is witnessing lower volumes due to reduced consumer spending as a result of hiked interest rates and a spike in fuel prices. The company anticipates the segment’s organic revenues to decline by mid-to-high-single digits in 2022.Steep Costs and Expenses: Cost inflation poses a threat to Stanley Black’s bottom line. In the first nine months of 2022, SWK’s cost of sales, and selling, general and administrative expenses jumped 28.6% and 15.6%, respectively, year over year. Supply chain disruptions are added concerns for the company, which are weighing on margins and profitability.Forex Woes: Given the company’s vast international presence, it is exposed to currency translation risks. Forex woes hampered Stanley Black’s sales by 4% on a year-over-year basis in the third quarter 2022. The performance of its overseas business might be depressed by a stronger U.S. dollar in the quarters ahead.Southbound Estimate Trend: In the past 60 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2022 earnings has been revised 3.3% downward.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchDue to these headwinds, shares of Stanley Black have lost 31% compared with the industry’s decline of 11.8% over the past six months.Zacks Rank &amp; Stocks to ConsiderSWK currently carries a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell).Some top-ranked stocks in the Industrial Products sector are:MRC Global Inc.

307,4909fbc4-4c7b-36df-80dc-1e97477cb872,TRV,2023-01-05,CECO Environmental and Amazon have been highlighted as Zacks Bull and Bear of the Day,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/ceco-environmental-amazon-highlighted-zacks-134601754.html,1672839961,STORY,"['AMZN', 'CECO', 'TRV', 'ALL-PG']","[For Immediate ReleaseChicago, IL – January 4, 2023 – Zacks Equity Research shares CECO Environmental CECO as the Bull of the Day and Amazon AMZN as the Bear of the Day. In addition, Zacks Equity Research provides analysis on The Travelers Companies, Inc. TRV and The Allstate Corporation ALL.Here is a synopsis of all four stocks.Bull of the Day:CECO Environmental is a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) and it sports a C for Value and an A for Growth. This company helps protect people from industrial exposures and that in turn, helps keep the environment safe. This stock has bucked the system, seeing a dramatic run since May while the broader market tumbled. Let’s explore more about this company in this Bull of The Day article.DescriptionCECO Environmental Corp. provides industrial air quality and fluid handling systems worldwide. It operates in two segments: Engineered Systems Segment and Industrial Process Solutions Segment. The company markets its products and services to natural gas processors, transmission and distribution companies, refineries, power generators, industrial manufacturing, engineering and construction companies, semiconductor manufacturers, compressor manufacturers, beverage can manufacturers, metals and minerals, and electric vehicle producer companies. CECO Environmental Corp. was incorporated in 1966 and is headquartered in Dallas, Texas.Earnings HistoryWhen I look at a stock, the first thing I do is look to see if the company is beating the number. This tells me right away where the market’s expectations have been for the company and how management has communicated to the market. A stock that consistently beats has management communicating expectations to Wall Street that can be achieved. That is what you want to see.For CECO, I see four straight beats of the Zacks Consensus Estimate. That is great to see, but by itself that is not enough to make the company a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).Story continuesThe average positive earnings surprise over the course of the last year works out to be 62%.Earnings Estimates RevisionsThe Zacks Rank tells us which stocks are seeing earnings estimates move higher.Over the last 60 days, earning estimates have moved up for CECO.This quarter has moved up from $0.17 to $0.20.The full fiscal year 2022 has increased from $0.63 to $0.73.Next fiscal year has seen the estimate move from $0.77 to $0.92.Positive movement in earnings helped move this stock to a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).ValuationThe valuation for this name is low even with the solid growth. I see a forward PE of 16x which is a little low given the company is coming off a quarter that saw topline growth of more than 35%. The price to book multiple is 2x. Price to sales comes in a 1x while the stock carries operating margins of roughly 4%.Bear of the Day:Amazon is a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) after missing earnings in late October. The November retail sales report came in awfully weak so it is not surprising to see analysts taking down estimates of select consumer goods names. This article will look at why this stock is a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) as it is the Bear of the Day.DescriptionAmazon.com is one of the largest e-commerce providers, with sprawling operations in North America, now spreading across the globe.Its online retail business revolves around the Prime program well-supported by the company’s massive distribution network. Further, the Whole Foods Market acquisition helped Amazon establish a footprint in the physical grocery supermarket space.Earnings HistoryWhen I look at a stock, the first thing I do is look to see if the company is beating the number. This tells me right away where the market’s expectations have been for the company and how management has communicated to the market.  A stock that consistently beats has management communicating expectations to Wall Street that can be achieved. That is what you want to see.In the case of AMZN, I see one beat of the  Zacks Consensus Estimate and three misses. This alone does not make the stock a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) and it doesn’t make it a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) either.The Zacks Rank does care about the earnings history, but it is much more heavily influenced by the movement of earnings estimates.Earnings EstimatesThe Zacks Rank tells us which stocks are seeing earnings estimates move higher or in this case lower. For AMZN I see annual estimates moving lower of late.The current fiscal year consensus number moved lower from a loss of $0.09  to a loss of $0.12 over the last 60 days.The next year has moved from $1.70 to $1.56. That move lower is probably the biggest deciding factor for this stock to be a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell).Negative movement in earnings estimates like that is why this stock is a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell).It should be noted that a majority of stocks in the Zacks universe are seeing negative earnings estimate revisions. That means that the stocks that are seeing small but negative earnings estimate revisions are falling to a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell).Additional content:Travelers or Allstate: Which P&amp;C Stock Is Better Placed Right Now?The U.S. property and casualty (P&amp;C) insurance industry has been benefitting from a couple of factors — a better pricing environment, exposure growth and strong customer retention rates. Frequent rate hikes by the Fed act as another tailwind for insurers. However, continued catastrophic events and persistent inflationary headwinds might create roadblocks in the way of P&amp;C insurers.Premiums, being the most significant contributors to insurers’ top lines, remain well-poised for growth as an improved pricing environment encourages insurers to implement price hikes. With consistent rate increases, insurers can pursue uninterrupted claim payments, which is of dire need amid an active catastrophe season. According to the Swiss Re Institute, the insurance industry is expected to generate average annual premium growth of 2.1% in 2023 and 2024.Though an active catastrophe environment comes with its share of worries, they usually accelerate the policy renewal rate. P&amp;C insurers also remain equipped with reinsurance covers and favorable reserve development to counter catastrophe losses and shield their underwriting results.An improving interest rate scenario usually boosts the investment yields of insurers. Seven rate hikes were implemented by the Fed last year. Reports have surfaced hinting at rate increases in early 2023.A solid capital position motivates P&amp;C insurers to increasingly undertake mergers and acquisitions (M&amp;A). These growth initiatives aim to strengthen an insurer’s capability and bring about a diversified portfolio, which minimize concentration risks for insurers. However, the looming fear of recession and continued interest rate increases might slow down the pace of entering M&amp;A deals by industry players.The insurance industry pursues significant technology investments in blockchain, AI and advanced analytics for ramping up claim payments and bringing about automation in processes. These investments will save operational costs and boost the margins of insurers in the long-run.The prevailing scenario makes us optimistic regarding consistent growth in the industry, which should boost the prospects of companies with sound business fundamentals.The Zacks P&amp;C Insurance industry, which is housed within the broader Zacks Finance sector, has gained 10.4% in the past six months compared with the sector’s growth of 2.6%. The S&amp;P Index dipped 0.5% in the same time frame.Against this backdrop, let’s take a look at the two P&amp;C insurers, The Travelers Companies, Inc. and The Allstate Corporation, with market capitalizations of $43.9 billion and $36 billion, respectively. Both stocks carry a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) at present. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Let's delve deeper into specific parameters to ascertain which company is better positioned at the moment.Price PerformanceThough shares of both companies have underperformed the industry’s rally of 10.4% in the past six months, Travelers has the edge over Allstate on this front. TRV and ALL gained 9.6% and 3.8%, respectively, in the same time frame.Earnings Surprise HistoryA stock’s earnings surprise track helps investors get an idea about its performance in the previous quarters.Travelers’ bottom line beat estimates in each of the trailing four quarters, the average surprise being 25.39%. Meanwhile, Allstate’s earnings surpassed the mark in three of the trailing four quarters and missed once, the average surprise being 8.29%. It is clear that TRV has a better reading than ALL here.Return on Equity (ROE)ROE is a profitability measure, which indicates how efficiently the company is utilizing its shareholders' funds.Travelers’ ROE of 14.3% compares favorably with Allstate’s ROE of 5.1% and remains higher than the industry’s average of 6.7%.ValuationPrice-to-book (P/B) value is the best multiple used for valuing insurers. Compared with Allstate’s trailing 12-month P/B ratio of 2.31, Travelers is cheaper, with a reading of 2.21. The P&amp;C insurance industry’s P/B ratio is 1.52.Debt-to-Equity RatioThe lower the debt-to-equity ratio, the better it is for the company, as it implies a sound solvency level. Both stocks have a higher leverage ratio than the industry’s average of 25.8%. TRV’s leverage ratio of 36.6% betters ALL’s ratio of 45.4%. Therefore, Travelers holds an edge over Allstate on this front.Dividend YieldBoth companies are regular dividend payers. Allstate’s dividend yield of 2.5% betters Travelers’ metric of 2% and remains higher than the industry’s average of 0.4%. ALL wins over TRV on this front.Growth ProjectionBoth stocks' expected long-term earnings growth rate is lower than the industry’s average of 9.7%. However, the metric for Travelers is pegged at 5.5%, better than Allstate’s figure of 5.1%.VGM ScoreVGM Score rates each stock on their combined weighted styles, helping to identify those with the most attractive value, best growth and the most promising momentum. Both Travelers and Allstate have an impressive VGM Score of B, faring equally on this front.Insurance PremiumsOne of the major contributors to a P&amp;C insurer’s revenues is its premiums. Net written premiums of Travelers improved 11% year over year in the first nine months of 2022. Meanwhile, Allstate’s premiums rose 8.4% year over year in the same time frame. Thus. TRV is the winner in this context.ConclusionOur comparative analysis shows that Travelers is better-poised than Allstate with respect to most metrics barring the ones on dividend yield and VGM Score. With the scale significantly toward TRV, the stock appears to be better positioned than ALL.Why Haven’t You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?Our 5 best-performing strategies have blown away the S&amp;P's impressive +28.8% gain in 2021.

Firstly, we'd want to identify a growing return on capital employed (ROCE) and then alongside that, an ever-increasing base of capital employed. This shows us that it's a compounding machine, able to continually reinvest its earnings back into the business and generate higher returns. With that in mind, the ROCE of Air Products and Chemicals (NYSE:APD) looks decent, right now, so lets see what the trend of returns can tell us.What Is Return On Capital Employed (ROCE)?Just to clarify if you're unsure, ROCE is a metric for evaluating how much pre-tax income (in percentage terms) a company earns on the capital invested in its business. Analysts use this formula to calculate it for Air Products and Chemicals:Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)0.10 = US$2.5b ÷ (US$27b - US$3.5b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to September 2022).Therefore, Air Products and Chemicals has an ROCE of 10%. In absolute terms, that's a pretty normal return, and it's somewhat close to the Chemicals industry average of 12%. See our latest analysis for Air Products and Chemicals roceAbove you can see how the current ROCE for Air Products and Chemicals compares to its prior returns on capital, but there's only so much you can tell from the past. If you'd like to see what analysts are forecasting going forward, you should check out our free report for Air Products and Chemicals.The Trend Of ROCEThe trend of ROCE doesn't stand out much, but returns on a whole are decent. The company has consistently earned 10% for the last five years, and the capital employed within the business has risen 48% in that time. 10% is a pretty standard return, and it provides some comfort knowing that Air Products and Chemicals has consistently earned this amount. Over long periods of time, returns like these might not be too exciting, but with consistency they can pay off in terms of share price returns.Story continuesOur Take On Air Products and Chemicals' ROCEIn the end, Air Products and Chemicals has proven its ability to adequately reinvest capital at good rates of return. On top of that, the stock has rewarded shareholders with a remarkable 103% return to those who've held over the last five years. So while investors seem to be recognizing these promising trends, we still believe the stock deserves further research.If you want to continue researching Air Products and Chemicals, you might be interested to know about the 2 warning signs that our analysis has discovered.While Air Products and Chemicals isn't earning the highest return, check out this free list of companies that are earning high returns on equity with solid balance sheets.Have feedback on this article?

314,618c51ad-bbb8-3e4f-85f3-310187e1bfbd,CMI,2023-01-05,Cummins Inc. (NYSE:CMI) insiders sold US$2.6m worth of stock suggesting impending weakness.,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/cummins-inc-nyse-cmi-insiders-140036607.html,1672840836,STORY,['CMI'],"[In the last year, many Cummins Inc. (NYSE:CMI) insiders sold a substantial stake in the company which may have sparked shareholders' attention. When evaluating insider transactions, knowing whether insiders are buying versus if they selling is usually more beneficial, as the latter can be open to many interpretations. However, when multiple insiders sell stock over a specific duration, shareholders should take notice as that could possibly be a red flag.While insider transactions are not the most important thing when it comes to long-term investing, we do think it is perfectly logical to keep tabs on what insiders are doing. Check out our latest analysis for Cummins The Last 12 Months Of Insider Transactions At CumminsOver the last year, we can see that the biggest insider sale was by the Senior Vice President, Livingston Satterthwaite, for US$1.0m worth of shares, at about US$230 per share. So it's clear an insider wanted to take some cash off the table, even below the current price of US$241. As a general rule we consider it to be discouraging when insiders are selling below the current price, because it suggests they were happy with a lower valuation. While insider selling is not a positive sign, we can't be sure if it does mean insiders think the shares are fully valued, so it's only a weak sign. We note that the biggest single sale was only 6.6% of Livingston Satterthwaite's holding.Insiders in Cummins didn't buy any shares in the last year. You can see a visual depiction of insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last 12 months, below. If you want to know exactly who sold, for how much, and when, simply click on the graph below!insider-trading-volumeIf you like to buy stocks that insiders are buying, rather than selling, then you might just love this free list of companies. (Hint: insiders have been buying them).Insiders At Cummins Have Sold Stock RecentlyThe last quarter saw substantial insider selling of Cummins shares. In total, insiders sold US$1.0m worth of shares in that time, and we didn't record any purchases whatsoever. This may suggest that some insiders think that the shares are not cheap.Story continuesInsider Ownership Of CumminsFor a common shareholder, it is worth checking how many shares are held by company insiders. A high insider ownership often makes company leadership more mindful of shareholder interests. Cummins insiders own about US$143m worth of shares (which is 0.4% of the company). Most shareholders would be happy to see this sort of insider ownership, since it suggests that management incentives are well aligned with other shareholders.So What Does This Data Suggest About Cummins Insiders?Insiders haven't bought Cummins stock in the last three months, but there was some selling. Looking to the last twelve months, our data doesn't show any insider buying. It is good to see high insider ownership, but the insider selling leaves us cautious. So these insider transactions can help us build a thesis about the stock, but it's also worthwhile knowing the risks facing this company. You'd be interested to know, that we found 2 warning signs for Cummins and we suggest you have a look.If you would prefer to check out another company -- one with potentially superior financials -- then do not miss this free list of interesting companies, that have HIGH return on equity and low debt.For the purposes of this article, insiders are those individuals who report their transactions to the relevant regulatory body.

325,c35b6812-26fc-3ab8-82ba-5664025d95b1,CL,2023-01-05,Investors in Colgate-Palmolive (NYSE:CL) have made a return of 22% over the past three years,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/investors-colgate-palmolive-nyse-cl-120057299.html,1672920057,STORY,['CL'],"[Low-cost index funds make it easy to achieve average market returns. But in any diversified portfolio of stocks, you'll see some that fall short of the average. For example, the Colgate-Palmolive Company (NYSE:CL) share price return of 14% over three years lags the market return in the same period. Unfortunately, the share price has fallen 5.9% over twelve months.With that in mind, it's worth seeing if the company's underlying fundamentals have been the driver of long term performance, or if there are some discrepancies. Check out our latest analysis for Colgate-Palmolive There is no denying that markets are sometimes efficient, but prices do not always reflect underlying business performance. One imperfect but simple way to consider how the market perception of a company has shifted is to compare the change in the earnings per share (EPS) with the share price movement.Over the last three years, Colgate-Palmolive failed to grow earnings per share, which fell 5.1% (annualized).The strong decline in earnings per share suggests the market isn't using EPS to judge the company. Since the change in EPS doesn't seem to correlate with the change in share price, it's worth taking a look at other metrics.It may well be that Colgate-Palmolive revenue growth rate of 4.9% over three years has convinced shareholders to believe in a brighter future. In that case, the company may be sacrificing current earnings per share to drive growth, and maybe shareholder's faith in better days ahead will be rewarded.The image below shows how earnings and revenue have tracked over time (if you click on the image you can see greater detail).earnings-and-revenue-growthColgate-Palmolive is well known by investors, and plenty of clever analysts have tried to predict the future profit levels. So we recommend checking out this free report showing consensus forecastsWhat About Dividends?It is important to consider the total shareholder return, as well as the share price return, for any given stock. The TSR incorporates the value of any spin-offs or discounted capital raisings, along with any dividends, based on the assumption that the dividends are reinvested. So for companies that pay a generous dividend, the TSR is often a lot higher than the share price return. We note that for Colgate-Palmolive the TSR over the last 3 years was 22%, which is better than the share price return mentioned above. This is largely a result of its dividend payments!Story continuesA Different PerspectiveAlthough it hurts that Colgate-Palmolive returned a loss of 3.7% in the last twelve months, the broader market was actually worse, returning a loss of 20%. Of course, the long term returns are far more important and the good news is that over five years, the stock has returned 4% for each year. In the best case scenario the last year is just a temporary blip on the journey to a brighter future. I find it very interesting to look at share price over the long term as a proxy for business performance. But to truly gain insight, we need to consider other information, too. For instance, we've identified   1 warning sign for Colgate-Palmolive  that you should be aware of.Of course, you might find a fantastic investment by looking elsewhere. So take a peek at this free list of companies we expect will grow earnings.Please note, the market returns quoted in this article reflect the market weighted average returns of stocks that currently trade on US exchanges.Have feedback on this article?

To keep the lesson grounded in practicality, we'll use ROE to better understand Comcast Corporation (NASDAQ:CMCSA).Return on equity or ROE is an important factor to be considered by a shareholder because it tells them how effectively their capital is being reinvested. Simply put, it is used to assess the profitability of a company in relation to its equity capital. Check out our latest analysis for Comcast How To Calculate Return On Equity?The formula for ROE is:Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' EquitySo, based on the above formula, the ROE for Comcast is:6.2% = US$5.0b ÷ US$81b (Based on the trailing twelve months to September 2022).The 'return' is the income the business earned over the last year. So, this means that for every $1 of its shareholder's investments, the company generates a profit of $0.06.Does Comcast Have A Good ROE?One simple way to determine if a company has a good return on equity is to compare it to the average for its industry. However, this method is only useful as a rough check, because companies do differ quite a bit within the same industry classification. As is clear from the image below, Comcast has a lower ROE than the average (12%) in the Media industry.roeUnfortunately, that's sub-optimal. However, a low ROE is not always bad. If the company's debt levels are moderate to low, then there's still a chance that returns can be improved via the use of financial leverage. A high debt company having a low ROE is a different story altogether and a risky investment in our books. To know the 4 risks we have identified for Comcast visit our risks dashboard for free.Why You Should Consider Debt When Looking At ROEMost companies need money -- from somewhere -- to grow their profits. The cash for investment can come from prior year profits (retained earnings), issuing new shares, or borrowing. In the first two cases, the ROE will capture this use of capital to grow. In the latter case, the use of debt will improve the returns, but will not change the equity. Thus the use of debt can improve ROE, albeit along with extra risk in the case of stormy weather, metaphorically speaking.Story continuesComcast's Debt And Its 6.2% ROEComcast clearly uses a high amount of debt to boost returns, as it has a debt to equity ratio of 1.20. Its ROE is quite low, even with the use of significant debt; that's not a good result, in our opinion. Investors should think carefully about how a company might perform if it was unable to borrow so easily, because credit markets do change over time.SummaryReturn on equity is useful for comparing the quality of different businesses. In our books, the highest quality companies have high return on equity, despite low debt. If two companies have the same ROE, then I would generally prefer the one with less debt.But ROE is just one piece of a bigger puzzle, since high quality businesses often trade on high multiples of earnings. Profit growth rates, versus the expectations reflected in the price of the stock, are a particularly important to consider. So I think it may be worth checking this free report on analyst forecasts for the company.Of course Comcast may not be the best stock to buy. So you may wish to see this free collection of other companies that have high ROE and low debt.Have feedback on this article? Concerned about the content? Get in touch with us directly.

(NYSE:PRU) insiders sold US$9.2m worth of stock, possibly signalling a downtrend",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/prudential-financial-inc-nyse-pru-130024155.html,1672837224,STORY,['PRU'],"[Over the past year, many Prudential Financial, Inc. (NYSE:PRU) insiders sold a significant stake in the company which may have piqued investors' interest. When analyzing insider transactions, it is usually more valuable to know whether insiders are buying versus knowing if they are selling, as the latter sends an ambiguous message. However, if numerous insiders are selling, shareholders should investigate more.While we would never suggest that investors should base their decisions solely on what the directors of a company have been doing, we would consider it foolish to ignore insider transactions altogether. View our latest analysis for Prudential Financial The Last 12 Months Of Insider Transactions At Prudential FinancialOver the last year, we can see that the biggest insider sale was by the Chairman, Charles Lowrey, for US$3.4m worth of shares, at about US$120 per share. While we don't usually like to see insider selling, it's more concerning if the sales take place at a lower price. It's of some comfort that this sale was conducted at a price well above the current share price, which is US$99.48. So it may not tell us anything about how insiders feel about the current share price.Prudential Financial insiders didn't buy any shares over the last year. The chart below shows insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last year. If you click on the chart, you can see all the individual transactions, including the share price, individual, and the date!insider-trading-volumeFor those who like to find winning investments this free list of growing companies with recent insider purchasing, could be just the ticket.Prudential Financial Insiders Are Selling The StockThe last three months saw significant insider selling at Prudential Financial. In total, insiders dumped US$1.1m worth of shares in that time, and we didn't record any purchases whatsoever. In light of this it's hard to argue that all the insiders think that the shares are a bargain.Story continuesDoes Prudential Financial Boast High Insider Ownership?Another way to test the alignment between the leaders of a company and other shareholders is to look at how many shares they own. Usually, the higher the insider ownership, the more likely it is that insiders will be incentivised to build the company for the long term. Insiders own 0.1% of Prudential Financial shares, worth about US$46m. This level of insider ownership is good but just short of being particularly stand-out. It certainly does suggest a reasonable degree of alignment.So What Do The Prudential Financial Insider Transactions Indicate?Insiders haven't bought Prudential Financial stock in the last three months, but there was some selling. And even if we look at the last year, we didn't see any purchases. Insider ownership isn't particularly high, so this analysis makes us cautious about the company. So we'd only buy after careful consideration. So these insider transactions can help us build a thesis about the stock, but it's also worthwhile knowing the risks facing this company. In terms of investment risks, we've identified 4 warning signs with Prudential Financial and understanding these should be part of your investment process.If you would prefer to check out another company -- one with potentially superior financials -- then do not miss this free list of interesting companies, that have HIGH return on equity and low debt.For the purposes of this article, insiders are those individuals who report their transactions to the relevant regulatory body.

However, stock prices are usually driven by a company’s financial performance over the long term, which in this case looks quite promising. In this article, we decided to focus on Devon Energy's  ROE.Return on equity or ROE is a key measure used to assess how efficiently a company's management is utilizing the company's capital. In simpler terms, it measures the profitability of a company in relation to shareholder's equity. View our latest analysis for Devon Energy How Is ROE Calculated?Return on equity can be calculated by using the formula:Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' EquitySo, based on the above formula, the ROE for Devon Energy is:58% = US$6.3b ÷ US$11b (Based on the trailing twelve months to September 2022).The 'return' is the amount earned after tax over the last twelve months. That means that for every $1 worth of shareholders' equity, the company generated $0.58 in profit.Why Is ROE Important For Earnings Growth?Thus far, we have learned that ROE measures how efficiently a company is generating its profits. Depending on how much of these profits the company reinvests or ""retains"", and how effectively it does so, we are then able to assess a company’s earnings growth potential. Assuming everything else remains unchanged, the higher the ROE and profit retention, the higher the growth rate of a company compared to companies that don't necessarily bear these characteristics.Devon Energy's Earnings Growth And 58% ROETo begin with, Devon Energy has a pretty high ROE which is interesting. Secondly, even when compared to the industry average of 33% the company's ROE is quite impressive. Under the circumstances, Devon Energy's considerable five year net income growth of 35% was to be expected.Next, on comparing with the industry net income growth, we found that Devon Energy's growth is quite high when compared to the industry average growth of 7.3% in the same period, which is great to see.Story continuespast-earnings-growthEarnings growth is an important metric to consider when valuing a stock. What investors need to determine next is if the expected earnings growth, or the lack of it, is already built into the share price. This then helps them determine if the stock is placed for a bright or bleak future. One good indicator of expected earnings growth is the P/E ratio which determines the price the market is willing to pay for a stock based on its earnings prospects. So, you may want to check if Devon Energy is trading on a high P/E or a low P/E, relative to its industry.Is Devon Energy Efficiently Re-investing Its Profits?Devon Energy's three-year median payout ratio to shareholders is 12%, which is quite low. This implies that the company is retaining 88% of its profits. This suggests that the management is reinvesting most of the profits to grow the business as evidenced by the growth seen by the company.Additionally, Devon Energy has paid dividends over a period of at least ten years which means that the company is pretty serious about sharing its profits with shareholders. Upon studying the latest analysts' consensus data, we found that the company is expected to keep paying out approximately 11% of its profits over the next three years. Regardless, Devon Energy's ROE is speculated to decline to 16% despite there being no anticipated change in its payout ratio.SummaryOverall, we are quite pleased with Devon Energy's performance. In particular, it's great to see that the company is investing heavily into its business and along with a high rate of return, that has resulted in a sizeable growth in its earnings. That being so, according to the latest industry analyst forecasts, the company's earnings are expected to shrink in the future.

The rotary rig count, issued by BKR, is usually published in major newspapers and trade publications.Baker Hughes’ data, issued at the end of every week since 1944, helps energy service providers gauge the overall business environment of the oil and gas industry. The number of active rigs and its comparison with the prior-week figure indicates the demand trajectory for Baker Hughes’ oilfield services from exploration and production companies.DetailsTotal U.S. Rig Count Flat: The count of rigs engaged in the exploration and production of oil and natural gas in the United States was 779 for the week ended Dec 30. The figure is flat with the prior week’s count. The tally increased in five of the prior nine weeks. The current national rig count is higher than the year-ago level of 586.The onshore rigs in the week ended Dec 30 totaled 762, in line with the prior week's count. In offshore resources, 15 rigs were operating, also in line with the prior week’s count.U.S. Oil Rig Count Falls: The oil rig count was 621 in the week ended Dec 30, lower than the prior-week figure of 622. The current number of oil rigs — far from the peak of 1,609 attained in October 2014 — is, however, up from the year-ago figure of 480.U.S. Natural Gas Rig Count Increases: Natural gas rig count of 156 is higher than the prior-week figure of 155. The count of rigs exploring the commodity is higher than the prior-year week’s tally of 106. Per the latest report, the number of natural gas-directed rigs is 90.3% lower than the all-time high of 1,606 recorded in 2008.Rig Count by Type: The number of vertical drilling rigs totaled 27 units, in line with the prior-week count. The horizontal/directional rig count (encompassing new drilling technology with the ability to drill and extract gas from dense rock formations, also known as shale formations) of 752 is flat with the prior-week level.Story continuesGulf of Mexico (GoM) Rig Count Flat: GoM rig count was 15 units, all oil-directed. The count was in line with the prior-week number.Rig Count in the Most Prolific BasinPermian — the most prolific basin in the United States — recorded a weekly oil rig tally of 350, higher than the prior week's count of 349. The tally increased in three successive weeks.OutlookThe West Texas Intermediate crude price is trading at more than the $75-per-barrel mark, which is still highly favorable for exploration and production activities. Solid oil prices will likely pave the way for further rig additions despite a slowdown in drilling activities, as upstream players mainly focus on stockholder returns rather than boosting output.Investors may keep a close eye on energy stocks like EOG Resources EOG and Devon Energy Corporation DVN, as these companies are expected to benefit from the current healthy oil price scenario.EOG Resources, currently carrying a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), is a leading oil and natural gas exploration and production company. It is well-placed to capitalize on the promising business scenario. It has an estimated 11,500 net undrilled premium locations, resulting in a brightened production outlook.

Typically, we'll want to notice a trend of growing return on capital employed (ROCE) and alongside that, an expanding base of capital employed. Put simply, these types of businesses are compounding machines, meaning they are continually reinvesting their earnings at ever-higher rates of return. So while McDonald's (NYSE:MCD) has a high ROCE right now, lets see what we can decipher from how returns are changing.What Is Return On Capital Employed (ROCE)?Just to clarify if you're unsure, ROCE is a metric for evaluating how much pre-tax income (in percentage terms) a company earns on the capital invested in its business. Analysts use this formula to calculate it for McDonald's:Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)0.23 = US$10b ÷ (US$49b - US$3.5b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to September 2022).Therefore, McDonald's has an ROCE of 23%. In absolute terms that's a great return and it's even better than the Hospitality industry average of 11%. View our latest analysis for McDonald's roceAbove you can see how the current ROCE for McDonald's compares to its prior returns on capital, but there's only so much you can tell from the past. If you're interested, you can view the analysts predictions in our free report on analyst forecasts for the company.The Trend Of ROCEIn terms of McDonald's' historical ROCE movements, the trend isn't fantastic. Historically returns on capital were even higher at 29%, but they have dropped over the last five years. On the other hand, the company has been employing more capital without a corresponding improvement in sales in the last year, which could suggest these investments are longer term plays. It's worth keeping an eye on the company's earnings from here on to see if these investments do end up contributing to the bottom line.Story continuesThe Key TakeawayTo conclude, we've found that McDonald's is reinvesting in the business, but returns have been falling. Since the stock has gained an impressive 72% over the last five years, investors must think there's better things to come. But if the trajectory of these underlying trends continue, we think the likelihood of it being a multi-bagger from here isn't high.If you'd like to know about the risks facing McDonald's, we've discovered 1 warning sign that you should be aware of.McDonald's is not the only stock earning high returns.

But we also understand that investors develop their own strategies, so we are constantly looking at the latest trends in value, growth, and momentum to find strong companies for our readers.Looking at the history of these trends, perhaps none is more beloved than value investing. This strategy simply looks to identify companies that are being undervalued by the broader market. Value investors use a variety of methods, including tried-and-true valuation metrics, to find these stocks.On top of the Zacks Rank, investors can also look at our innovative Style Scores system to find stocks with specific traits. For example, value investors will want to focus on the ""Value"" category. Stocks with high Zacks Ranks and ""A"" grades for Value will be some of the highest-quality value stocks on the market today.One company to watch right now is PACCAR (PCAR). PCAR is currently sporting a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy), as well as an A grade for Value. The stock holds a P/E ratio of 12.13, while its industry has an average P/E of 19.75. Over the past year, PCAR's Forward P/E has been as high as 18.10 and as low as 10.39, with a median of 11.79.Investors should also note that PCAR holds a PEG ratio of 1.21. This popular metric is similar to the widely-known P/E ratio, with the difference being that the PEG ratio also takes into account the company's expected earnings growth rate. PCAR's PEG compares to its industry's average PEG of 1.35. Within the past year, PCAR's PEG has been as high as 1.81 and as low as 1.04, with a median of 1.18.Another valuation metric that we should highlight is PCAR's P/B ratio of 2.67. The P/B is a method of comparing a stock's market value to its book value, which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities. PCAR's current P/B looks attractive when compared to its industry's average P/B of 2.81. PCAR's P/B has been as high as 2.93 and as low as 2.20, with a median of 2.53, over the past year.Story continuesValue investors also frequently use the P/S ratio. This metric is found by dividing a stock's price with the company's revenue. This is a prefered metric because revenue can't really be manipulated, so sales are often a truer performance indicator. PCAR has a P/S ratio of 1.25. This compares to its industry's average P/S of 2.52.Value investors will likely look at more than just these metrics, but the above data helps show that PACCAR is likely undervalued currently. And when considering the strength of its earnings outlook, PCAR sticks out at as one of the market's strongest value stocks.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

This is expected to be January 31, 2023. On that day, United Parcel Service is projected to report earnings of $3.59 per share, which would represent no growth from the prior-year quarter. Our most recent consensus estimate is calling for quarterly revenue of $28.1 billion, up 1.2% from the year-ago period.Investors might also notice recent changes to analyst estimates for United Parcel Service. These revisions help to show the ever-changing nature of near-term business trends. With this in mind, we can consider positive estimate revisions a sign of optimism about the company's business outlook.Based on our research, we believe these estimate revisions are directly related to near-team stock moves.

Wall Street clearly dives into all of the other metrics and management's input, but the EPS figure helps cut through all the noise.The earnings figure itself is key, but a beat or miss on the bottom line can sometimes be just as, if not more, important. Therefore, investors should consider paying close attention to these earnings surprises, as a big beat can help a stock climb even higher.2 Stocks to Add to Your WatchlistThe Zacks Expected Surprise Prediction, or ESP, works by locking in on the most up-to-date analyst earnings revisions because they can be more accurate than estimates from weeks or even months before the actual release date. The thinking is pretty straightforward: analysts who provide earnings estimates closer to the report are likely to have more information. With this in mind, the Expected Surprise Prediction compares the Most Accurate Estimate (being the most recent) against the overall Zacks Consensus Estimate. The percentage difference provides the ESP figure.Now that we understand what the ESP is and how beneficial it can be, let's dive into a stock that currently fits the bill. United Parcel Service (UPS) earns a Zacks Rank #3 right now and its Most Accurate Estimate sits at $3.64 a share, just 27 days from its upcoming earnings release on January 31, 2023.UPS has an Earnings ESP figure of 1.5%, which, as explained above, is calculated by taking the percentage difference between the $3.64 Most Accurate Estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $3.59.UPS is part of a big group of Transportation stocks that boast a positive ESP, and investors may want to take a look at United Airlines (UAL) as well.United Airlines, which is readying to report earnings on January 18, 2023, sits at a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) right now. It's Most Accurate Estimate is currently $2.23 a share, and UAL is 14 days out from its next earnings report.Story continuesUnited Airlines' Earnings ESP figure currently stands at 4.59% after taking the percentage difference between its Most Accurate Estimate and its Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.13.Because both stocks hold a positive Earnings ESP, UPS and UAL could potentially post earnings beats in their next reports.Find Stocks to Buy or Sell Before They're ReportedUse the Zacks Earnings ESP Filter to turn up stocks with the highest probability of positively, or negatively, surprising to buy or sell before they're reported for profitable earnings season trading.

Allied reportedly had oil supplies worth $150 million inspected and collateralized by their creditors. But these oil supplies were discovered to be nothing more than seawater with oil floating on top, so it looked like they were full.In total, the company only had an inventory of roughly $6 million in oil.One of its largest creditors, American Express Co. (NYSE: AXP), was looking at a massive loss on its loan, which caused its stock to fall by over 50%.Buffett saw an opportunity. American Express was extremely profitable at the time but was poised to take a big hit. Buffett saw this as a way to get a profitable company at a steep discount and began buying up a massive 5% stake in American Express for roughly $20 million.Following the purchase, as predicted, American Express began to rebound considerably over the following years and significantly outperformed the market. It grew to one of Buffett's largest positions and roughly 40% of his entire portfolio near its peak.From 1964 to 1968, the stock rose from the purchase price of 94 cents per share to about $5 when Buffett began selling the position and taking gains. To this day, American Express still makes up roughly 7% of Warren Buffett’s portfolio, and he now owns 20% of the company. While this wasn’t without its risks, it certainly paid off for the Oracle of Omaha.What to know: While this seems like a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity, it’s not. It’s just about finding value, finding a good company, and committing.Story continuesOne great place to do this can be the startup market. Startup investing is all about finding new and innovative companies and then holding them long-term as they appreciate in value.For example, MaxTracker is a startup raising on StartEngine looking to pour gasoline on the Apple AirTag. It added GPS instead of Bluetooth, weatherproofing, 5G, one-year battery life, and a host of other features while sitting at a valuation of under $9 million.Hundreds of startups are raising on StartEngine at any given time, so anyone can browse the site and find value of their own. These investments can be speculative and illiquid, so it’s important never to invest more than you can afford to lose. See more on startup investing from Benzinga.This Unexpected Economic Safe Haven Might Be Your Best Bet To Weather The Current StormGaming Skins Just Became A $50 Billion IndustryDon't miss real-time alerts on your stocks - join Benzinga Pro for free!

These factors propel the demand for robust data storage solutions, bolstering the requirement for computer storage products. This favors the prospects of prominent industry players like NetApp, Pure Storage and Super Micro Computer.Democratization of higher internal memory smartphones, faster Internet speed and 5G is likely to act as a tailwind for the industry participants. Rapid deployment of 5G networking is driving the proliferation of IoT, Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS) and Augmented Reality/Virtual Reality (AR/VR) devices. However, negative impacts stemming from the pandemic-triggered supply chain disruptions and component shortages are a concern in the near term.Industry DescriptionThe Zacks Computer-Storage Devices industry houses companies that design, develop, manufacture and market various hard disk drives (HDDs) and solid-state drives (SSDs). These drives are utilized in PCs, laptops, mobiles, servers, network-attached storage (NAS) devices, video game consoles, digital video recorders and other consumer electronic devices.A few industry participants, including Pure Storage, provide software-defined all-flash solutions that are uniquely fast and cloud-capable for customers. Many industry players offer high-performance modular memory subsystems, mount and blade server systems, enterprise storage and data management software and hardware products and services.

Extensive implementation of cloud computing solutions, increased Internet usage and rapidly-growing media and regulatory compliance, driven by coronavirus-led work-from-home setup, have led to a data explosion for enterprises.Innovation in Cloud Storage Technologies to Drive Adoption: Extensive storage options from collocated hardware (such as hard disks and tape drives) to many cloud storage solutions have put the industry on a growth trajectory. The industry players are well poised for growth on the back of a rapid increase in the amount of data, the complexity of data formats and the need to scale resources at regular intervals. The companies rely on Artificial Intelligence for IT Operations (AIOps) and machine learning (ML) to manage and optimize storage solutions.To streamline data storage, companies are relying on virtualization technologies. As more data is amassed from IoT, companies are turning to edge computing architecture to reduce latency and boost flexibility. Kubernetes storage is becoming increasingly popular as it facilitates greater agility and scalability. This has bolstered the deployment of high-capacity mass storage products, which is a positive for industry playersMacro Headwinds May Prove a Drag on IT Spending: Per a Gartner report, worldwide IT spending is expected to increase a mere 0.8% in 2022 compared with 2021 levels and reach $4.4 trillion. Rising inflation is compelling organizations across the world to cut back on IT spend. Consumer spending cuts on the purchase of PCs, tablets and printers are likely to bring down the IT spending growth. Higher technology spending will drive the upside in the long term as enterprises continue to build sound technological infrastructure. For 2023, Gartner projects IT spending to be up 5.1% year over year, which is still less than the 10.2% spurt witnessed in 2021.Slowing Momentum in PC Shipments Might Hinder Growth Prospects: Worldwide PC shipments dropped 19.5% to 68 million units in the third quarter of 2022, according to the data compiled by Gartner. The latest Gartner report depicts the end of the massive spike in PC demand due to the pandemic-led work-from-home and online learning wave.In the third quarter, sales were affected by a huge inventory pile-up amid easing supply chain bottlenecks and a slump in demand. Further, global macroeconomic weakness, the Ukraine war and inflationary pressure are leading to careful IT spending by business organizations. A slowing PC market does not augur well for the industry participants.Zacks Industry Rank Indicates Dim ProspectsThe Zacks Computer Storage is housed within the broader Zacks Computer And Technology Sector.

These factors propel the demand for robust data storage solutions, bolstering the requirement for computer storage products. This favors the prospects of prominent industry players like NetApp NTAP, Pure Storage PSTG and Super Micro Computer SMCI. Democratization of higher internal memory smartphones, faster Internet speed and 5G is likely to act as a tailwind for the industry participants. Rapid deployment of 5G networking is driving the proliferation of IoT, Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS) and Augmented Reality/Virtual Reality (AR/VR) devices. However, negative impacts stemming from the pandemic-triggered supply chain disruptions and component shortages are a concern in the near term.Industry DescriptionThe Zacks Computer-Storage Devices industry houses companies that design, develop, manufacture and market various hard disk drives (HDDs) and solid-state drives (SSDs). These drives are utilized in PCs, laptops, mobiles, servers, network-attached storage (NAS) devices, video game consoles, digital video recorders and other consumer electronic devices. A few industry participants, including Pure Storage, provide software-defined all-flash solutions that are uniquely fast and cloud-capable for customers. Many industry players offer high-performance modular memory subsystems, mount and blade server systems, enterprise storage and data management software and hardware products and services.

Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: Conagra Brands Inc. CAG, Entergy Corp. ETR, Kimberly-Clark Corp. KMB, PPL Corp. PPL and CNA Financial Corp. CNA.Here are highlights from Wednesday’s Analyst Blog:5 Low-Beta High-Yielding Stocks for a Likely Volatile JanuaryWall Street wrapped up 2022 as the worst year since 2008, terminating a three-year winning streak. Major stock indexes suffered a bloody blow last year. The Dow fell 8.8% year over year and 10.3% from its record high. The S&amp;P 500 tumbled 19.4% year over year and more than 20% from its all-time high. The Nasdaq Composite plummeted 33.1% year over year and 32.9% from its all-time high.Sticky inflation at its 40-year high level due to the pandemic-led destruction of the global supply-chain system and strong demand from U.S. citizens due to unprecedented fiscal and monetary stimuli in the pandemic-ridden years, aggressive interest rate hikes by major central banks led by the Fed, lockdown in China due to the resurgence of COVID-19 infections and geopolitical conflict between Russia and Ukraine rattled the global financial world last year.U.S. stock markets started 2023 with huge volatility. On Jan 3, the first trading day of this year, intraday volatility of the Dow, the S&amp;P 500 and the Nasdaq Composite was around 537 points, 84 points and 304 points, respectively.Volatility is likely to continue in January as market participants will keenly watch the major economic data of December 2022. Moreover, the next FOMC meeting of the Fed will start from Feb 1, which will lead the foundation of the central bank’s policies for 2023.Recession Fears Grip MarketsLast year, the Fed raised the benchmark interest rate by 4.25%, which led the range of the Fed fund rate to 4.25-4.5%. The central bank projected in December the terminal rate to top out at 5.25% before it takes a call on pausing the hikes.

Major stock indexes suffered a bloody blow last year. The Dow fell 8.8% year over year and 10.3% from its record high. The S&amp;P 500 tumbled 19.4% year over year and more than 20% from its all-time high. The Nasdaq Composite plummeted 33.1% year over year and 32.9% from its all-time high.Sticky inflation at its 40-year high level due to the pandemic-led destruction of the global supply-chain system and strong demand from U.S. citizens due to unprecedented fiscal and monetary stimuli in the pandemic-ridden years, aggressive interest rate hikes by major central banks led by the Fed, lockdown in China due to the resurgence of COVID-19 infections and geopolitical conflict between Russia and Ukraine rattled the global financial world last year.U.S. stock markets started 2023 with huge volatility. On Jan 3, the first trading day of this year, intraday volatility of the Dow, the S&amp;P 500 and the Nasdaq Composite was around 537 points, 84 points and 304 points, respectively.Volatility is likely to continue in January as market participants will keenly watch the major economic data of December 2022. Moreover, the next FOMC meeting of the Fed will start from Feb 1, which will lead the foundation of the central bank’s policies for 2023.Recession Fears Grip MarketsLast year, the Fed raised the benchmark interest rate by 4.25%, which led the range of the Fed fund rate to 4.25-4.5%.

Focus on investing in innovation, technology and acquisitions in the pool business as well as residential and commercial water treatment will continue to stoke growth.Strong Pool Demand to Aid GrowthPentair’s pool business has generated a 10-year revenue CAGR of approximately 10%. The business benefitted from the surge in demand for swimming pools amid the pandemic as consumers were forced to stay at home, which triggered the desire to invest in their backyards. Even though the impact of the pandemic has abated, consumers continue to enhance their at-home quality of life by investing in pools. The emergence of Airbnb and Vrbo has also contributed to the rise in demand for homes with pools.PNR estimates that the pool industry in North America caters to a large installed base of approximately 5.4 million pools, with the average age of these pools approaching 25 years. Around 60% of the industrial demand is for repairing, 20% for major remodeling and 20% for new pools. Pentair is poised well to gain from these demand trends in the long term. Also, given that half of the installed pools lack any form of automation, the growing preference for more autonomous and energy-efficient pools will benefit the company as well.Transformation Program to Boost MarginsDuring second-quarter 2021, Pentair launched a Transformation program to accelerate growth and drive margin expansion. The program, structured in multiple phases, is expected to drive operational efficiency, streamline processes, and reduce complexity while meeting financial objectives. It will also utilize automation to increase productivity. The company is projecting at least 300 basis points of margin expansion by 2025 through the program.Innovation, Acquisitions Remain Key CatalystsPentair is investing in digital transformation, innovation and technology. Its strategy to grow through acquisitions in the high-growth areas of pool, residential and commercial water treatment, is commendable. In the Water Treatment business, Pentair is investing in innovative components, such as flat-connected valves for water softeners. Within Water Treatment, the company believes that there are opportunities to rapidly expand its $50 million end-to-end residential services business.In July 2022, Pentair completed the acquisition of Manitowoc Ice, which enables the company to enhance and deliver total water management offerings to an expanded network of channel partners and customers. The buyout will expand the company’s commercial water solutions platform and drive growth in the food service industry.Story continuesPrice PerformanceZacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchPentair’s shares have gained 6.3% in the past three months compared with the industry’s decline of 3%.Zacks Rank &amp; Stocks to ConsiderPentair currently has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

355,9e723530-5e91-34b2-9974-9db1ed7f678f,MDLZ,2023-01-05,Why Mondelez (MDLZ) Could Beat Earnings Estimates Again,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/why-mondelez-mdlz-could-beat-171005042.html,1672852205,STORY,['MDLZ'],"[Looking for a stock that has been consistently beating earnings estimates and might be well positioned to keep the streak alive in its next quarterly report? Mondelez (MDLZ), which belongs to the Zacks Food - Miscellaneous industry, could be a great candidate to consider.This maker of Oreo cookies, Cadbury chocolate and Trident gum has an established record of topping earnings estimates, especially when looking at the previous two reports. The company boasts an average surprise for the past two quarters of 6.76%.For the most recent quarter, Mondelez was expected to post earnings of $0.68 per share, but it reported $0.74 per share instead, representing a surprise of 8.82%. For the previous quarter, the consensus estimate was $0.64 per share, while it actually produced $0.67 per share, a surprise of 4.69%.Price and EPS SurpriseWith this earnings history in mind, recent estimates have been moving higher for Mondelez. In fact, the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) for the company is positive, which is a great sign of an earnings beat, especially when you combine this metric with its nice Zacks Rank.Our research shows that stocks with the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time. In other words, if you have 10 stocks with this combination, the number of stocks that beat the consensus estimate could be as high as seven.The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is related to change. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Mondelez currently has an Earnings ESP of +6.67%, which suggests that analysts have recently become bullish on the company's earnings prospects. This positive Earnings ESP when combined with the stock's Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) indicates that another beat is possibly around the corner.Story continuesWhen the Earnings ESP comes up negative, investors should note that this will reduce the predictive power of the metric. But, a negative value is not indicative of a stock's earnings miss.Many companies end up beating the consensus EPS estimate, but that may not be the sole basis for their stocks moving higher. On the other hand, some stocks may hold their ground even if they end up missing the consensus estimate.Because of this, it's really important to check a company's Earnings ESP ahead of its quarterly release to increase the odds of success. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

LW is likely to register top and bottom-line growth when it reports second-quarter fiscal 2023 earnings on Jan 5.

The projection indicates growth of 48% from the year-ago quarter’s reported figure.Lamb Weston has a trailing four-quarter earnings surprise of 47.3%, on average. This frozen potato product company delivered an earnings surprise of 44.2% in the last reported quarter.Lamb Weston Price, Consensus and EPS SurpriseLamb Weston Price, Consensus and EPS SurpriseLamb Weston price-consensus-eps-surprise-chart | Lamb Weston QuoteFactors to ConsiderLamb Weston has been benefiting from its robust pricing actions across core business segments to counter input, manufacturing and transportation cost inflation. Management expects the gross margin to have remained under pressure in the first half of fiscal 2023 due to considerable inflation for key production inputs, transportation and packaging, and rising raw potato costs on a per-pound basis.The gross margin is also likely to have borne the adverse impacts of supply-chain hurdles, resulting in operational bottlenecks like labor and commodities shortages.However, management highlighted that it expects to keep realizing the carryover benefit of product pricing actions in the Foodservice and Retail segments in fiscal 2023. In the Global segment, it expects to witness the benefit of pricing actions, which includes pricing structures for contract renewals.The abovementioned aspects bode well for the quarter under review. Further, Lamb Weston’s efforts to boost offerings and expand capacity enable the company to effectively meet rising demand conditions for snacks and fries.What the Zacks Model UnveilsOur proven model doesn’t conclusively predict an earnings beat for Lamb Weston this time. The combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) increases the chances of an earnings beat, which is not the case here.Lamb Weston has a Zacks Rank #3 and an Earnings ESP of 0.00%.

The results of the latest prospective study were published in the Egyptian Journal of Anesthesia.SpHb is not intended to replace laboratory blood testing. Hence, clinical decisions regarding red blood cell transfusions should be based on the clinician’s judgment considering factors like patient condition, continuous SpHb monitoring and laboratory diagnostic tests using blood samples, among others.The latest positive study outcome is a major stepping stone for Masimo’s non-invasive continuous Hb monitoring business across the world. This is likely to solidify Masimo’s position in the global real-time patient monitoring space.Significance of the StudyThe researchers noted that antepartum hemorrhage was associated with adverse maternal and neo-natal outcomes. They further noted that blood transfusion was also associated with a variety of risks. According to them, invasive laboratory Hb measurement, while a crucial factor in transfusion decisions, yielded intermittent and often delayed results. Thus, the researchers sought to assess whether the use of non-invasive, continuous Hb monitoring might allow faster detection of clinically significant blood loss and improve perioperative transfusion practices, among other objectives.The researchers found significant positive correlations between SpHb and invasive Hb values. Based on this, they concluded that continuous SpHb through Masimo Pulse CO-Oximetry indicated clinically acceptable accuracy of Hb measurement compared with invasive Hb, even at low Hb levels, in patients undergoing CS with antepartum hemorrhage.The researchers also noted that SpHb evaluation has the potential for additional benefits, including patient comfort, increased safety, and decreased complexity for healthcare staff, who are not exposed to the risks of needle-stick injury and bloodspill contamination.Story continuesIndustry ProspectsPer a report by MarketsandMarkets, the global patient blood management market is projected to reach $15.3 billion by 2024 from $10.7 billion in 2019 at a CAGR of 7.4%. Factors like the rising prevalence of blood disorders, the growing number of blood donations increasing the risk of transfusion-transmitted infections, and the escalation in road accidents, injuries, surgeries and trauma are expected to drive the market.Given the market potential, the positive study outcome is likely to provide a significant boost to Masimo’s business globally.Notable DevelopmentsLast month, Masimo announced the launch of the expansion of the HEOS platform to provide a robust and always-on connection to the Masimo Health secure cloud. This feature adds the ability to aggregate, record and display health data from wearable Masimo continuous and spot-check health and wellness devices.The same month, Masimo announced the limited market release of the Sepsis Index, an early warning indicator designed to aid clinicians in identifying possible sepsis in patients remotely monitored with Masimo Patient SafetyNet.Also, in December, Masimo announced the full-market release of the Hydration Index for the Masimo W1 watch. In the same press release, the company announced that a medical version of Masimo W1 would be available outside the United States for use in telehealth and telemonitoring applications via Masimo SafetyNet and Personal SafetyNet for healthcare providers and payers along with individual use.Price PerformanceShares of Masimo have lost 44.3% in the past year compared with the industry’s 23.9% decline and the S&amp;P 500's 19.8% fall.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchZacks Rank &amp; Stocks to ConsiderCurrently, Masimo carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).Some better-ranked stocks in the broader medical space are AMN Healthcare Services, Inc.

PACB, popularly known as PacBio, is well-poised for growth in the coming quarters, courtesy of its slew of strategic deals over the past few months. The optimism, led by a solid third-quarter 2022 performance and strength in its Sequel system, is expected to contribute further. However, stiff competition and production bottlenecks persist.Over the past year, this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock has lost 53.3% compared with the 23.9% fall of the industry and the 19.8% decline of the S&amp;P 500.The renowned global provider of sequencing systems has a market capitalization of $1.79 billion. The company projects 3.7% growth for 2023 and expects to maintain a strong performance. PacBio’s projected sales growth of 40% is favorable to the industry’s 13.8%. Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment Research Let’s delve deeper.Strategic Deals: We are optimistic about PacBio’s robust growth opportunities via its inking of a slew of deals over the past few months. The company, in December 2022, announced that its HiFi sequencing technology would be used in a pilot project for the Children’s Rare Disease Cohorts Initiative at Boston Children’s Hospital.In October, PacBio, along with Twist Bioscience Corporation, announced the availability of an initial portfolio of off-the-shelf long-read gene panels — Twist Alliance panels.Strength in Sequel System: We are optimistic about PacBio's flagship platform, the Sequel system, which has been fortifying the company’s footprint worldwide. The Sequel System has been a significant contributor to Pacific Bioscience’s top line.During its third-quarter 2022 earnings call in November 2022, PacBio confirmed that it delivered additional Sequel IIes to support multiple customers in their sequencing for a large, population-scale genome project in the United States. The company also shipped multiple Sequel IIes in a competitive deal to a customer in the Middle East planning to launch a population-scale program.Story continuesStrong Q3 Results: PacBio’s better-than-expected earnings in third-quarter 2022 buoy optimism. The company saw a robust increase in its Service and other revenues in the quarter. The company also gained from strength in its Consumables revenues during the quarter. Robust performance in the Asia-Pacific region is also encouraging. The company’s slew of launches over the past few months augurs well.DownsidesProduction Bottlenecks: PacBio must successfully manage product introductions and transitions, including the Single Molecule, Real-Time Cell 8M and Sequel II/IIe Systems. However, the company may incur significant costs during these transitions, which may not result in the anticipated benefits.Stiff Competition: PacBio operates in a highly competitive market, wherein its competitors offer nucleic acid sequencing equipment or consumables. Many of these companies currently have greater resources and may be able to respond more quickly and effectively than PacBio to new or changing opportunities, technologies, standards or customer requirements.Estimate TrendPacBio has been witnessing a negative estimate revision trend for 2023. Over the past 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for its loss per share has widened from $1.36 to $1.37.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company’s fourth-quarter 2022 revenues is pegged at $26.4 million, suggesting a 26.8% decline from the year-ago quarter’s reported number.This compares to our fourth-quarter revenue estimate of $25.8 million, suggesting a 28.3% fall from the year-ago quarter’s reported number.Key PicksSome better-ranked stocks in the broader medical space are AMN Healthcare Services, Inc.

The proven Zacks Rank emphasizes companies with positive estimate revision trends, and our Style Scores highlight stocks with specific traits.PetIQ and Boston Scientific are both sporting a Zacks Rank of # 2 (Buy) right now. The Zacks Rank favors stocks that have recently seen positive revisions to their earnings estimates, so investors should rest assured that both of these companies have improving earnings outlooks. But this is just one factor that value investors are interested in.Value investors also try to analyze a wide range of traditional figures and metrics to help determine whether a company is undervalued at its current share price levels.Our Value category grades stocks based on a number of key metrics, including the tried-and-true P/E ratio, the P/S ratio, earnings yield, and cash flow per share, as well as a variety of other fundamentals that value investors frequently use.PETQ currently has a forward P/E ratio of 6.58, while BSX has a forward P/E of 23.97. We also note that PETQ has a PEG ratio of 0.82.

BSX currently has a PEG ratio of 2.32.Another notable valuation metric for PETQ is its P/B ratio of 1.29. The P/B ratio is used to compare a stock's market value with its book value, which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities. For comparison, BSX has a P/B of 3.73.Story continuesThese are just a few of the metrics contributing to PETQ's Value grade of A and BSX's Value grade of C.Both PETQ and BSX are impressive stocks with solid earnings outlooks, but based on these valuation figures, we feel that PETQ is the superior value option right now.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

362,39653606-d4c8-34da-8e44-bc79f6dadcca,BSX,2023-01-05,Walgreens (WBA) to Report Q1 Earnings: What's in the Cards?,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/walgreens-wba-report-q1-earnings-161904778.html,1672849144,STORY,"['WBA', 'AMN', 'BSX']","[Walgreens Boots Alliance, Inc. WBA is slated to release first-quarter fiscal 2023 results on Jan 05, before market open.In the fiscal fourth quarter, the company delivered an earnings surprise of 2.6%. WBA’s earnings outperformed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in each of the trailing four quarters, the average surprise being 10.61%.Let’s look at how things have shaped up prior to this announcement.Factors at PlayWalgreens is likely to have gained from continued strategic executions on both the United States and the international front. The quarter’s top line is likely to have benefited from the launch of a clinical trial business, which is expected to enhance the company’s participation, especially among diverse populations, while supporting sponsors in meeting the trial goal. The top line is likely to have benefited from the new Walgreens Health business, which brings equitable, personalized, whole-person healthcare to local communities across America.During fourth-quarter earnings call, the company noted that it recognized meaningful contributions from alternative profit streams for fiscal 2022, including Walgreen’s advertising group, with 35% growth. This is expected to have continued during the first quarter of fiscal 2023.In December 2022, Walgreens sold $0.8 billion shares of AmerisourceBergen Corporation subject to the completion of the Rule 144 sale, a concurrent share repurchase by AmerisourceBergen for proceeds of approximately $0.2 billion. The proceeds will be used primarily for debt paydown and the funding of the company’s strategic priorities, including the definitive agreement for VillageMD to acquire Summit Health-CityMD. This strategic development is likely to have contributed to the company’s fiscal first-quarter performance and improved its debt position.United StatesWalgreens is likely to have registered growth in U.S. retail pharmacy business, banking on resurging demand for vaccinations and tests amid the spread of new virus variants through the months of the fiscal first quarter. The company administered 35 million vaccinations in fiscal 2022, well beyond its expectation. Moreover, the company’s expanded access to offering Pixel by Labcorp and at-home PCR kits at no cost through curbside and in-store pickup has been seen to gain strong customer acceptance over the past few months. This, too, should have contributed to the top line in the fiscal first quarter.Story continuesWalgreens Boots Alliance, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise Walgreens Boots Alliance, Inc. Price and EPS SurpriseWalgreens Boots Alliance, Inc. price-eps-surprise | Walgreens Boots Alliance, Inc. Quote In the United States, Walgreens’ retail business continued to witness impressive momentum through digital and omnichannel growth from the myWalgreens loyalty program, owned brand innovation and other profit streams. In the fiscal fourth quarter, U.S. digital sales grew 37% on top of 74% growth a year ago. These developments are likely to have contributed to Walgreens’ fiscal first-quarter revenues.In fiscal 2022, Walgreens Boots has added three strategic partners for Walgreens Health, Blue Shield of California, Clover and Buckeye, bringing the number of lives covered above the calendar year 2022 end target of 2 million. This development is likely to benefit company’s top line in the to-be-reported quarter.InternationalIn the last reported quarter, the international business registered an ongoing rebound and strong execution across its retail portfolio, particularly in Boots U.K. and growth in the German wholesale business. The trend is expected to have continued in the fiscal first quarter, banking on strong demand for COVID-19 and monkeypox testing and vaccinations, online healthcare services and beauty brands.In the fiscal fourth quarter, sales increased 6.6% year over year, reflecting growth across all international markets, with Boots UK advancing 6% and Germany wholesale growing 6.8%. Walgreens noted that the integration of the wholesale business in Germany remained on track, with operational synergy gains coming ahead of schedule. This development is expected to have accelerated international businesses in the to-be-reported quarter.Walgreens HealthThe Walgreens Health segment is likely to have gained from its majority investments in Shields Health and VillageMD. VillageMD is leading the way in value-based care for the nation, with over 340 clinics now open, including about 150 co-located with Walgreens. In the fiscal fourth quarter, Shields delivered pro forma sales growth of 48%. VillageMD and Shields are expected to have driven pro-forma sales growth in the to-be-reported quarter on the back of annualizing recent contract wins and expanding their value proposition with existing health system partners.EstimatesFor first-quarter 2023, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for total revenues of $32.96 billion indicates a 2.8% dip from the prior-year comparable quarter’s reported figure. The consensus mark for earnings is pegged at $1.14, suggesting a 32.1% decline year on year.What Our Model SuggestsPer our proven model, a stock with the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) has higher chance of beating estimates.

Holding on to stock would have meant their investment would be worth less now than it was at the time of sale. Thus selling at an average price of US$112, which is higher than the current price, may have been the best decision.Although we don't think shareholders should simply follow insider transactions, logic dictates you should pay some attention to whether insiders are buying or selling shares. View our latest analysis for Capital One Financial The Last 12 Months Of Insider Transactions At Capital One FinancialIn the last twelve months, the biggest single sale by an insider was when the insider, Kara West, sold US$305k worth of shares at a price of US$110 per share. We generally don't like to see insider selling, but the lower the sale price, the more it concerns us. The good news is that this large sale was at well above current price of US$92.97. So it may not tell us anything about how insiders feel about the current share price.Insiders in Capital One Financial didn't buy any shares in the last year. You can see the insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last year depicted in the chart below. If you want to know exactly who sold, for how much, and when, simply click on the graph below!insider-trading-volumeFor those who like to find winning investments this free list of growing companies with recent insider purchasing, could be just the ticket.Insiders At Capital One Financial Have Sold Stock RecentlyThe last quarter saw substantial insider selling of Capital One Financial shares. In total, insider Kara West dumped US$69k worth of shares in that time, and we didn't record any purchases whatsoever. This may suggest that some insiders think that the shares are not cheap.Insider OwnershipMany investors like to check how much of a company is owned by insiders. We usually like to see fairly high levels of insider ownership. It's great to see that Capital One Financial insiders own 1.2% of the company, worth about US$410m. Most shareholders would be happy to see this sort of insider ownership, since it suggests that management incentives are well aligned with other shareholders.Story continuesSo What Do The Capital One Financial Insider Transactions Indicate?An insider hasn't bought Capital One Financial stock in the last three months, but there was some selling. And there weren't any purchases to give us comfort, over the last year. While insiders do own a lot of shares in the company (which is good), our analysis of their transactions doesn't make us feel confident about the company. While we like knowing what's going on with the insider's ownership and transactions, we make sure to also consider what risks are facing a stock before making any investment decision. For example, Capital One Financial has 3 warning signs (and 1 which is significant) we think you should know about.Of course, you might find a fantastic investment by looking elsewhere. So take a peek at this free list of interesting companies.For the purposes of this article, insiders are those individuals who report their transactions to the relevant regulatory body.

Buying under-rated businesses is one path to excess returns. To wit, the Vertex Pharmaceuticals share price has climbed 81% in five years, easily topping the market return of 33% (ignoring dividends). On the other hand, the more recent gains haven't been so impressive, with shareholders gaining just 29%.Let's take a look at the underlying fundamentals over the longer term, and see if they've been consistent with shareholders returns. View our latest analysis for Vertex Pharmaceuticals To quote Buffett, 'Ships will sail around the world but the Flat Earth Society will flourish. There will continue to be wide discrepancies between price and value in the marketplace...' One imperfect but simple way to consider how the market perception of a company has shifted is to compare the change in the earnings per share (EPS) with the share price movement.During five years of share price growth, Vertex Pharmaceuticals achieved compound earnings per share (EPS) growth of 74% per year. This EPS growth is higher than the 13% average annual increase in the share price. So one could conclude that the broader market has become more cautious towards the stock.The company's earnings per share (over time) is depicted in the image below (click to see the exact numbers).earnings-per-share-growthWe know that Vertex Pharmaceuticals has improved its bottom line lately, but is it going to grow revenue? You could check out this free report showing analyst revenue forecasts.A Different PerspectiveIt's good to see that Vertex Pharmaceuticals has rewarded shareholders with a total shareholder return of 29% in the last twelve months. That's better than the annualised return of 13% over half a decade, implying that the company is doing better recently. In the best case scenario, this may hint at some real business momentum, implying that now could be a great time to delve deeper. It's always interesting to track share price performance over the longer term. But to understand Vertex Pharmaceuticals better, we need to consider many other factors. Take risks, for example - Vertex Pharmaceuticals has   1 warning sign   we think you should be aware of.Story continuesWe will like Vertex Pharmaceuticals better if we see some big insider buys.

The deal has been awarded by the Air Force Life Cycle Management, Tinker Air Force Base, OK.Details of the DealValued at $38.7 million, the contract is projected to be completed by Dec 31, 2023. Per the terms of the deal, Boeing will provide recurring and non-recurring engineering services to B-1 and B-52 aircraft.With this latest modification, the cumulative value of the contract now stands at $1.20 billion. Work related to the deal will be executed in Edwards AFB, CA; Barksdale AFB, LA; as well as Tinker Air Force Base and Oklahoma City, OK.Advantages of Boeing’s B-1 &amp; B-52 BomberBoeing's B-1 is a long-range, multi-mission, supersonic conventional bomber, which is equipped to carry eight air-launched cruise missiles or 24 SRAMs alongside up to 24 nuclear bombs or 84 500-pound conventional bombs.The Boeing B-52 primarily provides the U.S. military with immediate nuclear and conventional global strike capabilities. Due to its high mission-capable rate, large payload, long range, persistence and ability to employ nuclear and conventional precision standoff weapons, the B-52 continues to be a critical contributor to the U.S. National Security Strategy.Growth ProspectsWith rising security threats across the globe, emerging economies like South America, the Asia Pacific, and the Middle East are spending a lot on enhancing their defense arsenals. Meanwhile, Europe and the United States have already been leading the defense market. With the United States being the largest worldwide weapons exporter, the nation has been spending amply on defense products. Boeing, the largest aircraft manufacturer in the United States, thus enjoys a dominant position in the combat aircraft market.Per a Mordor Intelligence report, the global military aviation market is expected to witness a CAGR of 5.3% during the 2022-2028 time period, with North America constituting the largest share of this market. Such growth can be attributed to a rise in global threats and geopolitical instabilities and increased spending on defense. These projections should benefit Boeing along with other U.S.-based combat jet manufacturers like Northrop Grumman NOC, Lockheed Martin LMT and Textron TXT.Since its inception, Northrop Grumman has been a pioneer in the development of manned aircraft for combat.

Healthcare is something that everyone will need at some point in their lives, so today’s industry of $8.3 trillion spent globally is an indication of a growing, profitable sector – one that could create many opportunities for those looking to make significant investments. The U.S. alone accounts for almost half of the total healthcare expenditure, which is set to grow at an incredible pace in the coming decade. Therefore, healthcare stocks to buy are set for substantial progress ahead, with the population of individuals over 65 expected to rise by 113% from 2019 to 2050.Healthcare stocks have seen a huge rally in 2022, and even though there have been multiple negative macro factors that influence markets, companies with specific catalysts have managed to gain immensely.

In light of these promising developments, Verona expressed plans to seek FDA approval for its novel treatment in the first half of 2023. With over 12 million people affected by COPD in the U.S. alone, the firm’s long-term position looks mighty encouraging.

In addition, several potential blockbuster treatments in its pipeline could also put them ahead of the curve in the not-so-distant future.

One common approach is to try and find a company with returns on capital employed (ROCE) that are increasing, in conjunction with a growing amount of capital employed. Put simply, these types of businesses are compounding machines, meaning they are continually reinvesting their earnings at ever-higher rates of return. So, when we ran our eye over Waste Management's (NYSE:WM) trend of ROCE, we liked what we saw.What Is Return On Capital Employed (ROCE)?For those that aren't sure what ROCE is, it measures the amount of pre-tax profits a company can generate from the capital employed in its business. To calculate this metric for Waste Management, this is the formula:Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)0.13 = US$3.3b ÷ (US$30b - US$3.8b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to September 2022).Therefore, Waste Management has an ROCE of 13%. On its own, that's a standard return, however it's much better than the 9.3% generated by the Commercial Services industry. Check out our latest analysis for Waste Management roceIn the above chart we have measured Waste Management's prior ROCE against its prior performance, but the future is arguably more important. If you're interested, you can view the analysts predictions in our free report on analyst forecasts for the company.How Are Returns Trending?The trend of ROCE doesn't stand out much, but returns on a whole are decent. The company has consistently earned 13% for the last five years, and the capital employed within the business has risen 47% in that time. 13% is a pretty standard return, and it provides some comfort knowing that Waste Management has consistently earned this amount. Stable returns in this ballpark can be unexciting, but if they can be maintained over the long run, they often provide nice rewards to shareholders.Story continuesThe Bottom Line On Waste Management's ROCETo sum it up, Waste Management has simply been reinvesting capital steadily, at those decent rates of return. Therefore it's no surprise that shareholders have earned a respectable 95% return if they held over the last five years. So while the positive underlying trends may be accounted for by investors, we still think this stock is worth looking into further.On a separate note, we've found   1 warning sign for Waste Management   you'll probably want to know about.While Waste Management isn't earning the highest return, check out this free list of companies that are earning high returns on equity with solid balance sheets.Have feedback on this article?

But even the best stock picker will only win with some selections. So we wouldn't blame long term General Electric Company (NYSE:GE) shareholders for doubting their decision to hold, with the stock down 54% over a half decade. More recently, the share price has dropped a further 18% in a month.Given the past week has been tough on shareholders, let's investigate the fundamentals and see what we can learn. See our latest analysis for General Electric While the efficient markets hypothesis continues to be taught by some, it has been proven that markets are over-reactive dynamic systems, and investors are not always rational. One imperfect but simple way to consider how the market perception of a company has shifted is to compare the change in the earnings per share (EPS) with the share price movement.General Electric became profitable within the last five years. On the other hand, it reported a trailing twelve months loss, suggesting it isn't reliably profitable. Other metrics may better explain the share price move.The modest 0.5% dividend yield is unlikely to be guiding the market view of the stock. Arguably, the revenue drop of 10.0% a year for half a decade suggests that the company can't grow in the long term. This has probably encouraged some shareholders to sell down the stock.You can see how earnings and revenue have changed over time in the image below (click on the chart to see the exact values).earnings-and-revenue-growthWe like that insiders have been buying shares in the last twelve months. Having said that, most people consider earnings and revenue growth trends to be a more meaningful guide to the business. This free report showing analyst forecasts should help you form a view on General ElectricWhat About Dividends?When looking at investment returns, it is important to consider the difference between total shareholder return (TSR) and share price return. The TSR is a return calculation that accounts for the value of cash dividends (assuming that any dividend received was reinvested) and the calculated value of any discounted capital raisings and spin-offs. It's fair to say that the TSR gives a more complete picture for stocks that pay a dividend. We note that for General Electric the TSR over the last 5 years was -36%, which is better than the share price return mentioned above. This is largely a result of its dividend payments!Story continuesA Different PerspectiveAlthough it hurts that General Electric returned a loss of 9.6% in the last twelve months, the broader market was actually worse, returning a loss of 20%. Given the total loss of 6% per year over five years, it seems returns have deteriorated in the last twelve months. While some investors do well specializing in buying companies that are struggling (but nonetheless undervalued), don't forget that Buffett said that 'turnarounds seldom turn'. Investors who like to make money usually check up on insider purchases, such as the price paid, and total amount bought.

GE has finally spun off its health unit, creating the newly listed GE Healthcare on the NASDAQ, which began trading today. The parent GE will still have nearly a 20% stake in the spinoff. And while this isn't a new business line for GE, it does signal the appeal of an industry that accounts for nearly 20% of the country's GDP. Between the influx of tech and other consumer brands in recent years, everyone is wrangling for their piece of the $4 trillion pie. I feel like I talk about this all the time.Tracking-- while tracking tech and technology sectors' attempts to infiltrate the space has been top of mind for investors, brands like Best Buy, you see retail pharmacies and others that you recognize. As you can see on your screen, Lyft, Uber, UPS, you wouldn't think, has its own health unit. So increasingly, these companies are trying to find new avenues to capitalize on what is a sector that just won't quit.Medtech especially, which often covers devices, is an area of growth as more companies tinker with the idea of consumer-facing health devices. That came, of course, we saw during the pandemic, more remote monitoring, more wearables. And so these companies are really trying to get in on that space.Meanwhile, you've got legacy medtech sector, the medtech-- medtech sector-- wow, I didn't realize I was going to have that tongue twister in there-- dominated by big pharma. Think of J&amp;J and Medtronic and the like. That's going to be really interesting to watch because they have been watching consumer habits.And you've seen some of these big players spin out or not pay as much attention to consumer brands, but also what consumers demand as patients, whether in the outpatient setting or when you're looking at remote monitoring wearables and the like. That's really going to drive the strategy of these companies, I think, in the coming years.DAVE BRIGGS: And the company, some feel, will be worth some $50 billion. This is going to be a huge spinoff. And really, the story of GE moving forward is going to be one of the stories of the year, in particular, the shedding of its power business. My eye's on GE Aerospace, the one that's worth the most money, somewhere in the neighborhood of $100 billion, they believe, spinning out more than $20 billion annually in revenue.]"

This change lagged the S&amp;P 500's 0.75% gain on the day. At the same time, the Dow added 0.4%, and the tech-heavy Nasdaq gained 10.36%.Coming into today, shares of the oil refiner had gained 0.99% in the past month. In that same time, the Oils-Energy sector lost 6.78%, while the S&amp;P 500 lost 5.98%.Valero Energy will be looking to display strength as it nears its next earnings release, which is expected to be January 26, 2023. In that report, analysts expect Valero Energy to post earnings of $6.23 per share. This would mark year-over-year growth of 152.23%. Our most recent consensus estimate is calling for quarterly revenue of $41.12 billion, up 14.54% from the year-ago period.Any recent changes to analyst estimates for Valero Energy should also be noted by investors. These revisions typically reflect the latest short-term business trends, which can change frequently. As such, positive estimate revisions reflect analyst optimism about the company's business and profitability.Research indicates that these estimate revisions are directly correlated with near-term share price momentum. To benefit from this, we have developed the Zacks Rank, a proprietary model which takes these estimate changes into account and provides an actionable rating system.Ranging from #1 (Strong Buy) to #5 (Strong Sell), the Zacks Rank system has a proven, outside-audited track record of outperformance, with #1 stocks returning an average of +25% annually since 1988. The Zacks Consensus EPS estimate has moved 13.37% lower within the past month. Valero Energy currently has a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold).Looking at its valuation, Valero Energy is holding a Forward P/E ratio of 6.64. This valuation marks a discount compared to its industry's average Forward P/E of 8.09.Also, we should mention that VLO has a PEG ratio of 1.11.

Therefore, you might want to consider some of the key factors that could influence the stock's performance in the near future.Over the past month, shares of this oil refiner have returned +1%, compared to the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's -6% change. During this period, the Zacks Oil and Gas - Refining and Marketing industry, which Valero Energy falls in, has lost 4.1%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?Although media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.Revisions to Earnings EstimatesHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.We essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.Valero Energy is expected to post earnings of $6.23 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +152.2%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -21.7%.The consensus earnings estimate of $27.23 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of +869%. This estimate has changed -13.4% over the last 30 days.Story continuesFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $18.09 indicates a change of -33.6% from what Valero Energy is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -13.4%.With an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for Valero Energy.The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPS12-month consensus EPS estimate for VLO _12MonthEPSChartUrlProjected Revenue GrowthEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.For Valero Energy, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $41.12 billion indicates a year-over-year change of +14.5%. For the current and next fiscal years, $175.76 billion and $150.93 billion estimates indicate +54.2% and -14.1% changes, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryValero Energy reported revenues of $44.45 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +50.6%. EPS of $7.14 for the same period compares with $1.22 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $39.01 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +13.94%. The EPS surprise was +2%.The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.ValuationNo investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.While comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.The Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.Valero Energy is graded A on this front, indicating that it is trading at a discount to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.Bottom LineThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Valero Energy. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

In contrast, the stock is down for the year. But at least it bettered the loss of 20% in its market.With that in mind, it's worth seeing if the company's underlying fundamentals have been the driver of long term performance, or if there are some discrepancies. Check out our latest analysis for Regency Centers To quote Buffett, 'Ships will sail around the world but the Flat Earth Society will flourish. There will continue to be wide discrepancies between price and value in the marketplace...' One imperfect but simple way to consider how the market perception of a company has shifted is to compare the change in the earnings per share (EPS) with the share price movement.Even though the Regency Centers share price is down over the year, its EPS actually improved. Of course, the situation might betray previous over-optimism about growth.The divergence between the EPS and the share price is quite notable, during the year. So it's easy to justify a look at some other metrics.We don't see any weakness in the Regency Centers' dividend so the steady payout can't really explain the share price drop. The revenue trend doesn't seem to explain why the share price is down. Of course, it could simply be that it simply fell short of the market consensus expectations.You can see how earnings and revenue have changed over time in the image below (click on the chart to see the exact values).earnings-and-revenue-growthIt's probably worth noting that the CEO is paid less than the median at similar sized companies. But while CEO remuneration is always worth checking, the really important question is whether the company can grow earnings going forward. So we recommend checking out this free report showing consensus forecastsWhat About Dividends?As well as measuring the share price return, investors should also consider the total shareholder return (TSR). The TSR incorporates the value of any spin-offs or discounted capital raisings, along with any dividends, based on the assumption that the dividends are reinvested. So for companies that pay a generous dividend, the TSR is often a lot higher than the share price return. We note that for Regency Centers the TSR over the last 1 year was -13%, which is better than the share price return mentioned above. The dividends paid by the company have thusly boosted the total shareholder return.Story continuesA Different PerspectiveWhile it's certainly disappointing to see that Regency Centers shares lost 13% throughout the year, that wasn't as bad as the market loss of 20%. Longer term investors wouldn't be so upset, since they would have made 4%, each year, over five years. It could be that the business is just facing some short term problems, but shareholders should keep a close eye on the fundamentals. It's always interesting to track share price performance over the longer term. But to understand Regency Centers better, we need to consider many other factors. Consider for instance, the ever-present spectre of investment risk.   We've identified 3 warning signs  with Regency Centers (at least 2 which are a bit concerning)  , and understanding them should be part of your investment process.If you would prefer to check out another company -- one with potentially superior financials -- then do not miss this free list of companies that have proven they can grow earnings.Please note, the market returns quoted in this article reflect the market weighted average returns of stocks that currently trade on US exchanges.Have feedback on this article?

While media reports about rating changes by these brokerage-firm employed (or sell-side) analysts often affect a stock's price, do they really matter?Before we discuss the reliability of brokerage recommendations and how to use them to your advantage, let's see what these Wall Street heavyweights think about Procter &amp; Gamble (PG).P&amp;G currently has an average brokerage recommendation (ABR) of 1.63, on a scale of 1 to 5 (Strong Buy to Strong Sell), calculated based on the actual recommendations (Buy, Hold, Sell, etc.) made by 12 brokerage firms. An ABR of 1.63 approximates between Strong Buy and Buy.Of the 12 recommendations that derive the current ABR, seven are Strong Buy and two are Buy. Strong Buy and Buy respectively account for 58.3% and 16.7% of all recommendations.Brokerage Recommendation Trends for PGBroker Rating Breakdown Chart for PGCheck price target &amp; stock forecast for P&amp;G here&gt;&gt;&gt;The ABR suggests buying P&amp;G, but making an investment decision solely on the basis of this information might not be a good idea. According to several studies, brokerage recommendations have little to no success guiding investors to choose stocks with the most potential for price appreciation.Are you wondering why? The vested interest of brokerage firms in a stock they cover often results in a strong positive bias of their analysts in rating it. Our research shows that for every ""Strong Sell"" recommendation, brokerage firms assign five ""Strong Buy"" recommendations.In other words, their interests aren't always aligned with retail investors, rarely indicating where the price of a stock could actually be heading. Therefore, the best use of this information could be validating your own research or an indicator that has proven to be highly successful in predicting a stock's price movement.With an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, which classifies stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), is a reliable indicator of a stock's near -term price performance. So, validating the Zacks Rank with ABR could go a long way in making a profitable investment decision.Story continuesZacks Rank Should Not Be Confused With ABRAlthough both Zacks Rank and ABR are displayed in a range of 1-5, they are different measures altogether.The ABR is calculated solely based on brokerage recommendations and is typically displayed with decimals (example: 1.28). In contrast, the Zacks Rank is a quantitative model allowing investors to harness the power of earnings estimate revisions. It is displayed in whole numbers -- 1 to 5.Analysts employed by brokerage firms have been and continue to be overly optimistic with their recommendations. Since the ratings issued by these analysts are more favorable than their research would support because of the vested interest of their employers, they mislead investors far more often than they guide.On the other hand, earnings estimate revisions are at the core of the Zacks Rank. And empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.Furthermore, the different grades of the Zacks Rank are applied proportionately across all stocks for which brokerage analysts provide earnings estimates for the current year. In other words, at all times, this tool maintains a balance among the five ranks it assigns.There is also a key difference between the ABR and Zacks Rank when it comes to freshness. When you look at the ABR, it may not be up-to-date. Nonetheless, since brokerage analysts constantly revise their earnings estimates to reflect changing business trends, and their actions get reflected in the Zacks Rank quickly enough, it is always timely in predicting future stock prices.Should You Invest in PG?In terms of earnings estimate revisions for P&amp;G, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has increased 0% over the past month to $5.83.Analysts' growing optimism over the company's earnings prospects, as indicated by strong agreement among them in revising EPS estimates higher, could be a legitimate reason for the stock to soar in the near term.The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) for P&amp;G.

The Federal Reserve raised the benchmark federal funds rate seven times last year to the highest level in 15 years to mitigate inflationary pressures. The S&amp;P United States REIT index plunged 27% in 2022. The benchmark S&amp;P 500 index, in comparison, is down 19.4% over the past year.The recessionary concerns have also battered real estate investment trusts (REITs), as demand for specific real estate properties such as housing and commercial office properties plummeted. After a stellar run in 2021, housing demand plunged by 30% in November last year. The permanent shift toward a remote working culture along with mass layoffs also harmed commercial office properties.As the inflation levels are still well above the Fed’s target of 2%, the central bank is expected to stick to its hawkish monetary policies.“There’s an expectation really that the services inflation will not move down so quickly, so we’ll have to stay at it,” Fed Chairman Jerome Powell said. “We may have to raise rates higher to get where we want to go.”Some of the hardest-hit REITs are:AvalonBay CommunitiesAvalonBay Communities Inc. (NYSE: AVB) is a residential REIT that owns 88,405 apartments across 12 states. It won the Nareit 2022 Leader in the Light Award, reflecting its superior environmental, social and governance (ESG) efforts.But shares of AvalonBay Communities declined 36.1% in 2022. Several analysts downgraded the stock anticipating underperformance amid the Fed’s continued hawkish stance and normalizing rental rates.Last month, Aperture Investors analyst Adam Kramer downgraded AVB stock from Overweight to Equal-Weight, while Goldman Sach analyst Chandi Luthra downgraded the stock from Buy to Neutral. Also, JP Morgan analysts downgraded AvalonBay Communities from Neutral to Underweight on Dec. 16. This comes after the REIT revised its fiscal 2022 core funds from operations (FFO) per share guidance from $9.76$9.96 to $9.74-$9.84.Story continuesAvalonBay Communities pays $6.36 per share as dividends annually, yielding 3.94%. Its four-year average dividend yield stands at 3.23%. Over the past five years, the REIT’s dividend payouts grew at a meager 2.3% compound annual growth rate (CAGR).Equity ResidentialShares of Chigaco-based Equity Residential (NYSE: EQR) declined 34.8% over the past year, given the tremendous macroeconomic turbulence. Equity Residential’s financials have taken a hit in recent quarters. In the third quarter that ended on Sept. 30, the REIT’s earnings per share (EPS) fell 25.2% year-over-year to $0.86.Equity Residential’s normalized FFO per share increased 19.5% year-over-year from $0.77 in the third quarter of 2021 to $0.92 in the third quarter of last year. The REIT pays $2.50 in dividends annually, translating to a 4.24% yield. Equity Residential raised its annual dividend payout by 9 cents, or 3.73%, from $2.41 in 2021 to $2.50 last year.Despite the softening rental rates, the REIT’s management has remained bullish regarding its 2023 growth prospects.“The substantial embedded growth in our rent roll and our financially resilient and highly employable resident base leaves us well-positioned to deliver above-average results in 2023 — despite likely macroeconomic turbulence. Longer term, we will continue to benefit from trends such as high single-family housing costs, favorable demographics and an overall deficit in housing across the country,” Equity Residential President and CEO Mark Parrell said.SL Green RealtyManhattan, New York’s largest commercial landlord, SL Green Realty Corp. (NYSE: SLG), has had a dismal year. SL Green stock plummeted 54.4% last year, making it one of the worst-performing office REITs in 2022. Analysts have also maintained a bearish sentiment regarding SL Green Realty. In December, SL Green stock was downgraded by BMO Capital Markets analyst John Kim, Scotiabank analyst Nicholas Yulico and Citigroup analyst Nicholas Joseph.The commercial REIT has been battered by the declining demand for office space over the past two years. For the nine months ended Sept. 30, SL Green Realty reported a net loss of $28.7 million, or 47 cents per share. This compares with the $486.1 million net income generated over the same period of 2021. The REIT slashed its dividend per share by 12.9% to $0.3108 last month. It pays $3.25 in dividends annually, translating to a 9.64% yield.As recession concerns loom, the possibility of speedy revival is slim for New York City’s largest landlord. The consensus FFO estimate of $5.72 for fiscal 2023 indicates a 14.1% decline year-over-year. Analysts expect the REIT’s revenue to improve by 2.4% in this year.Weekly REIT Report: REITs are one of the most misunderstood investment options, making it difficult for investors to spot incredible opportunities until it’s too late.

Horton, Inc. (NYSE:DHI) should be aware of the most powerful shareholder groups. We can see that institutions own the lion's share in the company with 87% ownership. Put another way, the group faces the maximum upside potential (or downside risk).Institutional investors would appreciate the 3.3% increase in share prices last week, given their one-year returns have been disappointing at 11%.In the chart below, we zoom in on the different ownership groups of D.R. Horton. View our latest analysis for D.R. Horton ownership-breakdownWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About D.R. Horton?Institutional investors commonly compare their own returns to the returns of a commonly followed index. So they generally do consider buying larger companies that are included in the relevant benchmark index.D.R. Horton already has institutions on the share registry. Indeed, they own a respectable stake in the company. This implies the analysts working for those institutions have looked at the stock and they like it. But just like anyone else, they could be wrong. If multiple institutions change their view on a stock at the same time, you could see the share price drop fast. It's therefore worth looking at D.R. Horton's earnings history below. Of course, the future is what really matters.earnings-and-revenue-growthSince institutional investors own more than half the issued stock, the board will likely have to pay attention to their preferences. We note that hedge funds don't have a meaningful investment in D.R. Horton. Looking at our data, we can see that the largest shareholder is Capital Research and Management Company with 17% of shares outstanding. With 10% and 8.4% of the shares outstanding respectively, The Vanguard Group, Inc. and BlackRock, Inc. are the second and third largest shareholders.A closer look at our ownership figures suggests that the top 12 shareholders have a combined ownership of 51% implying that no single shareholder has a majority.Story continuesWhile studying institutional ownership for a company can add value to your research, it is also a good practice to research analyst recommendations to get a deeper understand of a stock's expected performance. There are a reasonable number of analysts covering the stock, so it might be useful to find out their aggregate view on the future.Insider Ownership Of D.R. HortonWhile the precise definition of an insider can be subjective, almost everyone considers board members to be insiders. Management ultimately answers to the board. However, it is not uncommon for managers to be executive board members, especially if they are a founder or the CEO.Insider ownership is positive when it signals leadership are thinking like the true owners of the company. However, high insider ownership can also give immense power to a small group within the company. This can be negative in some circumstances.We can see that insiders own shares in D.R. Horton, Inc.. The insiders have a meaningful stake worth US$313m. It is good to see this level of investment. You can check here to see if those insiders have been buying recently. General Public OwnershipThe general public-- including retail investors -- own 12% stake in the company, and hence can't easily be ignored. While this size of ownership may not be enough to sway a policy decision in their favour, they can still make a collective impact on company policies.Next Steps:I find it very interesting to look at who exactly owns a company. But to truly gain insight, we need to consider other information, too. To that end, you should learn about the   3 warning signs  we've spotted with D.R. Horton (including 2 which are potentially serious) .But ultimately  it is the future, not the past, that will determine how well the owners of this business will do. Therefore we think it advisable to take a look at this free report showing whether analysts are predicting a brighter future.NB: Figures in this article are calculated using data from the last twelve months, which refer to the 12-month period ending on the last date of the month the financial statement is dated.

It beat estimates in each of the last four quarters with the average being 14.18%.Business TailwindsPrincipal Financial’s revenue growth is expected to improve in the long run, riding on higher premiums and other considerations, fees and other revenues and higher net investment income across its segments.The Principal International segment is likely to benefit from higher single premium annuity sales in Chile. The segment’s operating earnings should gain from foreign currency tailwinds.With positive net cash flow over the trailing 12 months, strong investment performance and the migration of institutional retirement and trust retirement assets, Principal Financial’s assets under management should continue to gain.The Specialty Benefits Insurance business should continue to gain from record sales, strong retention and employment growth. Growth in the business, favorable claims and disciplined expense management should benefit its pre-tax operating earnings.Principal Financial boasts a strong capital position. Its excess and available capital is currently estimated to be $1.4 billion and includes around $900 million at the holding company, higher than the $800 million target, $450 million in subsidiaries and $100 million in excess of the targeted 400% risk-based capital ratio.Principal Financial expects to return $2.5-$3 billion of capital to shareholders in 2022, consisting of $2-$2.3 billion in share repurchases.

This company, which is in the Zacks Insurance - Accident and Health industry, shows potential for another earnings beat.This insurer has seen a nice streak of beating earnings estimates, especially when looking at the previous two reports. The average surprise for the last two quarters was 7%.For the last reported quarter, Aflac came out with earnings of $1.23 per share versus the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.22 per share, representing a surprise of 0.82%. For the previous quarter, the company was expected to post earnings of $1.29 per share and it actually produced earnings of $1.46 per share, delivering a surprise of 13.18%.Price and EPS SurpriseWith this earnings history in mind, recent estimates have been moving higher for Aflac. In fact, the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) for the company is positive, which is a great sign of an earnings beat, especially when you combine this metric with its nice Zacks Rank.Our research shows that stocks with the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time. In other words, if you have 10 stocks with this combination, the number of stocks that beat the consensus estimate could be as high as seven.The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is related to change. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Aflac has an Earnings ESP of +4.13% at the moment, suggesting that analysts have grown bullish on its near-term earnings potential. When you combine this positive Earnings ESP with the stock's Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), it shows that another beat is possibly around the corner.Story continuesInvestors should note, however, that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss, but a negative value does reduce the predictive power of this metric.Many companies end up beating the consensus EPS estimate, but that may not be the sole basis for their stocks moving higher. On the other hand, some stocks may hold their ground even if they end up missing the consensus estimate.Because of this, it's really important to check a company's Earnings ESP ahead of its quarterly release to increase the odds of success.

394,cb653a88-eda4-3fa3-9bfa-3d4748160412,UHS,2023-01-05,Universal Health Services (NYSE:UHS) Will Want To Turn Around Its Return Trends,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/universal-health-services-nyse-uhs-125943981.html,1672923583,STORY,['UHS'],"[There are a few key trends to look for if we want to identify the next multi-bagger. One common approach is to try and find a company with returns on capital employed (ROCE) that are increasing, in conjunction with a growing amount of capital employed. Put simply, these types of businesses are compounding machines, meaning they are continually reinvesting their earnings at ever-higher rates of return. Having said that, from a first glance at Universal Health Services (NYSE:UHS) we aren't jumping out of our chairs at how returns are trending, but let's have a deeper look.Return On Capital Employed (ROCE): What Is It?For those that aren't sure what ROCE is, it measures the amount of pre-tax profits a company can generate from the capital employed in its business. To calculate this metric for Universal Health Services, this is the formula:Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)0.095 = US$1.1b ÷ (US$13b - US$1.9b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to September 2022).So, Universal Health Services has an ROCE of 9.5%.  On its own that's a low return on capital but it's in line with the industry's average returns of 10%. View our latest analysis for Universal Health Services roceAbove you can see how the current ROCE for Universal Health Services compares to its prior returns on capital, but there's only so much you can tell from the past. If you'd like, you can check out the forecasts from the analysts covering Universal Health Services here  for free.How Are Returns Trending?On the surface, the trend of ROCE at Universal Health Services doesn't inspire confidence. Around five years ago the returns on capital were 14%, but since then they've fallen to 9.5%. However it looks like Universal Health Services might be reinvesting for long term growth because while capital employed has increased, the company's sales haven't changed much in the last 12 months. It's worth keeping an eye on the company's earnings from here on to see if these investments do end up contributing to the bottom line.Story continuesOur Take On Universal Health Services' ROCEBringing it all together, while we're somewhat encouraged by Universal Health Services' reinvestment in its own business, we're aware that returns are shrinking. And with the stock having returned a mere 30% in the last five years to shareholders, you could argue that they're aware of these lackluster trends. So if you're looking for a multi-bagger, the underlying trends indicate you may have better chances elsewhere.On a final note, we've found   2 warning signs for Universal Health Services  that we think you should be aware of.While Universal Health Services may not currently earn the highest returns, we've compiled a list of companies that currently earn more than 25% return on equity.

Sometimes these stories can cloud the minds of investors, leading them to invest with their emotions rather than on the merit of good company fundamentals. While a well funded company may sustain losses for years, it will need to generate a profit eventually, or else investors will move on and the company will wither away.Despite being in the age of tech-stock blue-sky investing, many investors still adopt a more traditional strategy; buying shares in profitable companies like Union Pacific (NYSE:UNP). While profit isn't the sole metric that should be considered when investing, it's worth recognising businesses that can consistently produce it. View our latest analysis for Union Pacific Union Pacific's Earnings Per Share Are GrowingThe market is a voting machine in the short term, but a weighing machine in the long term, so you'd expect share price to follow earnings per share (EPS) outcomes eventually. So it makes sense that experienced investors pay close attention to company EPS when undertaking investment research. Over the last three years, Union Pacific has grown EPS by 8.9% per year. That growth rate is fairly good, assuming the company can keep it up.It's often helpful to take a look at earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) margins, as well as revenue growth, to get another take on the quality of the company's growth. It's noted that Union Pacific's revenue from operations was lower than its revenue in the last twelve months, so that could distort our analysis of its margins. EBIT margins for Union Pacific remained fairly unchanged over the last year, however the company should be pleased to report its revenue growth for the period of 15% to US$24b. That's progress.In the chart below, you can see how the company has grown earnings and revenue, over time. To see the actual numbers, click on the chart.Story continuesearnings-and-revenue-historyFortunately, we've got access to analyst forecasts of Union Pacific's future profits. You can do your own forecasts without looking, or you can take a peek at what the professionals are predicting.Are Union Pacific Insiders Aligned With All Shareholders?Owing to the size of Union Pacific, we wouldn't expect insiders to hold a significant proportion of the company. But we are reassured by the fact they have invested in the company. We note that their impressive stake in the company is worth US$195m. This comes in at 0.1% of shares in the company, which is a fair amount of a business of this size. So despite their percentage holding being low, company management still have plenty of reasons to deliver the best outcomes for investors.Does Union Pacific Deserve A Spot On Your Watchlist?One positive for Union Pacific is that it is growing EPS. That's nice to see. For those who are looking for a little more than this, the high level of insider ownership enhances our enthusiasm for this growth. These two factors are a huge highlight for the company which should be a strong contender your watchlists. Don't forget that there may still be risks. For instance, we've identified   1 warning sign for Union Pacific  that you should be aware of.There's always the possibility of doing well buying stocks that are not growing earnings and do not have insiders buying shares.

(NYSE:AMP) sold US$36m worth of stock, possibly indicating weakness in the future",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/insiders-ameriprise-financial-inc-nyse-130045370.html,1672837245,STORY,['AMP'],"[In the last year, many Ameriprise Financial, Inc. (NYSE:AMP) insiders sold a substantial stake in the company which may have sparked shareholders' attention. When analyzing insider transactions, it is usually more valuable to know whether insiders are buying versus knowing if they are selling, as the latter sends an ambiguous message. However, if numerous insiders are selling, shareholders should investigate more.Although we don't think shareholders should simply follow insider transactions, logic dictates you should pay some attention to whether insiders are buying or selling shares. Check out our latest analysis for Ameriprise Financial The Last 12 Months Of Insider Transactions At Ameriprise FinancialThe Chairman &amp; CEO, James Cracchiolo, made the biggest insider sale in the last 12 months. That single transaction was for US$18m worth of shares at a price of US$315 each. So what is clear is that an insider saw fit to sell at around the current price of US$311. While we don't usually like to see insider selling, it's more concerning if the sales take place at a lower price. In this case, the big sale took place at around the current price, so it's not too bad (but it's still not a positive).Insiders in Ameriprise Financial didn't buy any shares in the last year. You can see the insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last year depicted in the chart below. If you click on the chart, you can see all the individual transactions, including the share price, individual, and the date!insider-trading-volumeIf you are like me, then you will not want to miss this free list of growing companies that insiders are buying.Insiders At Ameriprise Financial Have Sold Stock RecentlyOver the last three months, we've seen significant insider selling at Ameriprise Financial. Specifically, insiders ditched US$843k worth of shares in that time, and we didn't record any purchases whatsoever. This may suggest that some insiders think that the shares are not cheap.Story continuesInsider Ownership Of Ameriprise FinancialLooking at the total insider shareholdings in a company can help to inform your view of whether they are well aligned with common shareholders. I reckon it's a good sign if insiders own a significant number of shares in the company. Ameriprise Financial insiders own 0.4% of the company, currently worth about US$128m based on the recent share price. This kind of significant ownership by insiders does generally increase the chance that the company is run in the interest of all shareholders.So What Does This Data Suggest About Ameriprise Financial Insiders?Insiders haven't bought Ameriprise Financial stock in the last three months, but there was some selling. And there weren't any purchases to give us comfort, over the last year. But it is good to see that Ameriprise Financial is growing earnings. It is good to see high insider ownership, but the insider selling leaves us cautious. So these insider transactions can help us build a thesis about the stock, but it's also worthwhile knowing the risks facing this company. Case in point: We've spotted 1 warning sign for Ameriprise Financial you should be aware of.Of course, you might find a fantastic investment by looking elsewhere. So take a peek at this free list of interesting companies.For the purposes of this article, insiders are those individuals who report their transactions to the relevant regulatory body.

(NYSE:GPS) Potentially Undervalued?",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/gap-inc-nyse-gps-potentially-133229412.html,1672839149,STORY,['GPS'],"[The Gap, Inc. (NYSE:GPS), might not be a large cap stock, but it saw a significant share price rise of over 20% in the past couple of months on the NYSE. With many analysts covering the mid-cap stock, we may expect any price-sensitive announcements have already been factored into the stock’s share price. But what if there is still an opportunity to buy? Let’s take a look at Gap’s outlook and value based on the most recent financial data to see if the opportunity still exists. See our latest analysis for Gap What's The Opportunity In Gap?Gap is currently expensive based on my price multiple model, where I look at the company's price-to-earnings ratio in comparison to the industry average. In this instance, I’ve used the price-to-earnings (PE) ratio given that there is not enough information to reliably forecast the stock’s cash flows. I find that Gap’s ratio of 75.2x is above its peer average of 8.72x, which suggests the stock is trading at a higher price compared to the Specialty Retail industry. If you like the stock, you may want to keep an eye out for a potential price decline in the future. Given that Gap’s share is fairly volatile (i.e. its price movements are magnified relative to the rest of the market) this could mean the price can sink lower, giving us another chance to buy in the future. This is based on its high beta, which is a good indicator for share price volatility.What kind of growth will Gap generate?earnings-and-revenue-growthInvestors looking for growth in their portfolio may want to consider the prospects of a company before buying its shares. Buying a great company with a robust outlook at a cheap price is always a good investment, so let’s also take a look at the company's future expectations. Gap's earnings over the next few years are expected to double, indicating a very optimistic future ahead. This should lead to stronger cash flows, feeding into a higher share value.What This Means For YouAre you a shareholder? GPS’s optimistic future growth appears to have been factored into the current share price, with shares trading above industry price multiples. However, this brings up another question – is now the right time to sell? If you believe GPS should trade below its current price, selling high and buying it back up again when its price falls towards the industry PE ratio can be profitable. But before you make this decision, take a look at whether its fundamentals have changed.Story continuesAre you a potential investor? If you’ve been keeping tabs on GPS for some time, now may not be the best time to enter into the stock. The price has surpassed its industry peers, which means it is likely that there is no more upside from mispricing. However, the positive outlook is encouraging for GPS, which means it’s worth diving deeper into other factors in order to take advantage of the next price drop.Keep in mind, when it comes to analysing a stock it's worth noting the risks involved.

(NASDAQ:CSCO). The company's stock led the NASDAQGS gainers with a relatively large price hike in the past couple of weeks. With many analysts covering the large-cap stock, we may expect any price-sensitive announcements have already been factored into the stock’s share price. However, could the stock still be trading at a relatively cheap price? Today I will analyse the most recent data on Cisco Systems’s outlook and valuation to see if the opportunity still exists. See our latest analysis for Cisco Systems What Is Cisco Systems Worth?Great news for investors – Cisco Systems is still trading at a fairly cheap price. According to my valuation, the intrinsic value for the stock is $66.87, but it is currently trading at US$47.55 on the share market, meaning that there is still an opportunity to buy now. Another thing to keep in mind is that Cisco Systems’s share price may be quite stable relative to the rest of the market, as indicated by its low beta. This means that if you believe the current share price should move towards its intrinsic value over time, a low beta could suggest it is not likely to reach that level anytime soon, and once it’s there, it may be hard to fall back down into an attractive buying range again.Can we expect growth from Cisco Systems?earnings-and-revenue-growthInvestors looking for growth in their portfolio may want to consider the prospects of a company before buying its shares. Buying a great company with a robust outlook at a cheap price is always a good investment, so let’s also take a look at the company's future expectations. Cisco Systems' earnings over the next few years are expected to increase by 21%, indicating a highly optimistic future ahead. This should lead to more robust cash flows, feeding into a higher share value.What This Means For YouAre you a shareholder? Since CSCO is currently undervalued, it may be a great time to accumulate more of your holdings in the stock. With a positive outlook on the horizon, it seems like this growth has not yet been fully factored into the share price. However, there are also other factors such as financial health to consider, which could explain the current undervaluation.Story continuesAre you a potential investor? If you’ve been keeping an eye on CSCO for a while, now might be the time to make a leap. Its buoyant future outlook isn’t fully reflected in the current share price yet, which means it’s not too late to buy CSCO.

In November, the most recent month for which data is available, the sector announced 52,771 cuts, for a total of 80,978 over the course of the year, according to consulting firm Challenger, Gray &amp; Christmas Inc. It was the highest monthly total for the industry since the firm started keeping data in 2000.More recently, tech giants such as Amazon.com Inc. and Microsoft Corp. have announced plans for deeper cuts. And a number of companies are reckoning with volatile cryptocurrency markets or a sudden slump in demand.After a bumpy start to the pandemic in 2020, tech companies benefited from a boom in e-commerce spending and remote work boomed, triggering a hiring spree. Now, things look different. In recent earnings reports, Alphabet Inc., Meta Platforms Inc., Microsoft and others missed estimates, sending shares plunging.There’s a Job-Market Riddle at the Heart of the Next RecessionHere’s a running list of who’s cutting jobs and pulling back on hiring.AdobeAdobe Inc. has eliminated about 100 jobs, concentrated in sales. The company shifted some employees to other roles internally.AmazonThe e-commerce titan is laying off 18,000 employees, Chief Executive Officer Andy Jassy announced on Jan. 4. The cuts, which started last year, were initially expected to affect about 10,000 jobs.“Amazon has weathered uncertain and difficult economies in the past, and we will continue to do so,” Jassy said. “These changes will help us pursue our long-term opportunities with a stronger cost structure.”Story continuesIn November, Amazon halted “new incremental” hiring across its corporate workforce.AppleThe iPhone maker has paused hiring for many jobs outside of research and development, an escalation of its plan to reduce budgets heading in the new year, according to people with knowledge of the matter. The break generally doesn’t apply to teams working on future devices and long-term initiatives, but it affects some corporate functions and standard hardware and software engineering roles.ChimeThe digital-banking startup Chime Financial Inc. is cutting 12% of its staff, or 160 people. A spokesperson said the company remains well-capitalized and the move will position it for “sustained success.”CiscoCisco Systems Inc. is beginning a restructuring plan that will affect about 5% of employees. The company says it will incur pretax charges of about $600 million for severance, termination and other costs. The employees will be given a chance to move to other jobs within the company, Chief Financial Officer Scott Herren said in an interview.“This is not about reducing our workforce — in fact we’ll have roughly the same number of employees at the end of this fiscal year as we had when we started,” Herren said. Cisco had more than 83,000 employees as of July 30.CoinbaseCoinbase Global Inc. is eliminating 60 positions as the cryptocurrency market slumps.

The plan may still be changed and the final number could be in a range of 15% to 20%, according to people familiar with the matter. Galaxy’s shares have plummeted more than 80% in the past year, part of a rout for cryptocurrencies.GenesisGenesis Global Trading Inc. has laid off 60 employees in its latest round of job cuts, or about 30% of the crypto brokerage’s workforce. The company now has 145 employees remaining.HPHP Inc. will cut as many as 6,000 jobs over the next three years as declining demand for personal computers cuts into profits. In addition to reducing its workforce by about 10%, the company will reduce its real estate footprint.IntelIntel Corp. is cutting jobs and slowing spending on new plants in an effort to save $3 billion, the chipmaker said. The hope is to save as much as $10 billion by 2025, a plan that went over well with investors, who sent the shares up more than 10% on Oct. 28. Bloomberg News reported earlier that the headcount reduction could number in the thousands.KrakenThe crypto exchange Kraken is laying off 30% of its workforce as the fallout from the digit-asset market meltdown worsens. The cuts account for about 1,100 people.LyftLyft Inc.’s cost-saving efforts include divesting its vehicle service business. It’s eliminating 13% of staff, or about 683 people.

It’s now facing even stiffer headwinds.“We are not immune to the realities of inflation and a slowing economy,” co-founders John Zimmer and Logan Green said in a memo. “We need 2023 to be a period where we can better execute without having to change plans in response to external events — and the tough reality is that today’s actions set us up to do that.”MetaThe Facebook parent is cutting 11,000 jobs, the first major round of layoffs in the social-media company’s history. Meta’s stock has plunged in the past year, and the company is trying to pare costs following several quarters of disappointing earnings and a slide in revenue. The reductions equal about 13% of the workforce, and Meta will extend its hiring freeze through the first quarter.“I want to take accountability for these decisions and for how we got here,” CEO Mark Zuckerberg said in the statement. “I know this is tough for everyone, and I’m especially sorry to those impacted.”MicrosoftMicrosoft Corp. said Wednesday it will cut 10,000 jobs this year, or about 5% of its workforce, which will result in a $1.2 billion charge in the fiscal second quarter. Chief Executive Officer Satya Nadella said in a blog post and internal email to employees that the company will continue to hire in “key strategic areas.” Nadella, speaking at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, said the tech industry needs to adjust to the broader economic slowdown. “During the pandemic there was rapid acceleration. I think we’re going to go through a phase today where there is some amount of normalization in demand. We will have to do more with less — we will have to show our own productivity gains with our own technology.”OpendoorOpendoor Technologies Inc. said that it’s laying off about 550 employees — roughly 18% of its headcount. The company, which practices a data-driven spin on home-flipping called iBuying, is coping with slowing housing demand because of higher mortgage rates.PelotonPeloton Interactive Inc. laid off 500 employees globally, or about 12% of the workforce, in October. It was the fourth time the company has cut staff over the past year. Along with other expense reduction measures, Peloton said the move will help it reach the break-even point on cash flow by the end of fiscal 2023.“I know many of you will feel angry, frustrated and emotionally drained by today’s news, but please know this is a necessary step if we are going to save Peloton, and we are,” CEO Barry McCarthy said in an October memo. “Our goal is to control our own destiny and assure the future viability of the business.”PlaidPlaid Inc. cut 260 staffers to reduce costs. The fintech company will provide 16 weeks of severance and accelerate equity grants for some employees, CEO Zach Perret said in a memo to staffers.QualcommQualcomm Inc. said that it’s frozen hiring in response to a faster-than-feared decline in demand for phones, which use its chips. It now expects smartphone shipments to decline in the double-digit percent range this year, worse than the outlook it gave earlier.SalesforceSalesforce will cut about 10% of its workforce and reduce its real estate holdings, according to a regulatory filing on Jan. 4. CEO Marc Benioff said in a letter to employees, “We hired too many people” during the pandemic. The software company had about 80,000 employees. The cutbacks included staff at Slack, Tableau and Mulesoft, businesses that Salesforce acquired in recent years.SeagateSeagate Technology Holdings Plc, the biggest maker of computer hard drives, said that it’s paring about 3,000 jobs. Computer suppliers, including Seagate and Intel, have been hard hit by a slowdown in hardware spending. Customers are sitting on a pile of extra inventory, hurting orders and weighing on Seagate’s financial performance, CEO Dave Mosley said. That necessitated cuts. “We have taken quick and decisive actions to respond to current market conditions and enhance long-term profitability,” he said.SilvergateSilvergate Capital Corp., a crypto bank, said it is firing 40% of its staff after customers withdrew $8.1 billion worth of digital assets during the fourth quarter.Stitch FixStitch Fix Inc. will cut about 20% of salaried employees as the personal-styling platform struggles to maintain the sales growth it saw during the pandemic. The company will also close its Salt Lake City distribution center.StripePayments company Stripe Inc., one of the world’s most valuable startups, is cutting more than 1,000 jobs. The 14% staff reduction will return its headcount to almost 7,000 — its total in February. Co-founders Patrick and John Collison told staff that they need to trim expenses more broadly as they prepare for “leaner times.”TwitterThe upheaval at Twitter has more to do with its recent buyout — and the accompanying debt — than economic concerns. But the company has suffered some of the deepest cuts of its peers right now. Elon Musk, who bought Twitter for $44 billion, eliminated about 3,700 jobs by email. Musk also reversed the company’s work-from-anywhere policy, asking remaining employees to report to offices.“Regarding Twitter’s reduction in force, unfortunately there is no choice when the company is losing over $4M/day,” Musk tweeted on Nov. 4.UpstartUpstart Holdings Inc., an online lending platform, said in a regulatory filing it cut 140 hourly employees “given the challenging economy and reduction in the volume of loans on our platform.”VimeoVimeo Inc. announced it will cut 11% of its global full-time workforce, according to a Jan. 4 regulatory filing.(Updates with Microsoft job cuts.)Most Read from Bloomberg BusinessweekWind Turbines Taller Than the Statue of Liberty Are Falling OverFake Meat Was Supposed to Save the World.

On December third we acknowledge International Day of Persons with Disabilities and reflect on Cisco Networking Academy's commitment to create an inclusive future for all, including people living with disabilities. This year, the United Nations unveils a theme echoing Cisco's position: ""Transformative solutions for inclusive development - the role of innovation in fuelling an accessible and equitable world.""As many as one billion people worldwide live with a disability. One in eight people are more likely to be disadvantaged by poorer education outcomes and lower levels of employment. One study of ten least developed and developing economies reports that excluding people with disabilities from the workforce could cost those economies between three and seven percent of GDP.Technology levels the playing field.At Cisco, we believe technology can power an inclusive future for all. For 25 years, Cisco Networking Academy has focused on providing high-quality IT curriculum in leading-edge subjects like networking and cybersecurity, learning simulators, and hands-on learning opportunities via a learning platform to support instructors and engage learners in 190 countries.Innovative platformCisco Networking Academy creates and delivers accessible curriculum, learning platforms, and tools to meet the needs of educators and students through design with compatible assistive technologies. Cisco Networking Academy's netacad.com and skillsforall.com learning platforms follow Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) to make content more accessible to a wide range of people with disabilities. In fiscal 2019, course enhancements included screen reader support (including lab instructions), transcripts, closed captions, keyboard shortcuts, and online accessibility resources for instructors to support students with accessibility accommodations.For more information about our work in this area, visit ourNetAcad Accessibility Online ResourceStory continuesPurpose-drivenThese course enhancements and design considerations follow a commitment Cisco made in 2017 to train 10,000 students with disabilities in five years.Inclusive workforce development goes beyond technology. It also requires innovation and a collaborative community that is united in purpose and serving together.Some innovative ‘firsts' for our Networking Academy ecosystem include:Partnering with UT de Santa Catarina in Mexico, one of the first institutions capable of offering a model of educational and labor inclusion for people with disabilities in the Americas.Creating Cisco Access for the Visually Impaired (CAVI), in partnership with Curtin University of Technology in Perth, Western Australia, which saw its first graduates in 2005. Dr. Iain Murray started the program as a short-term research project in 2001 and has since been awarded an Order of Australia for his work. The program now teaches close to 300 vision-impaired students annually from around the world through partnerships with organizations in India, Sri Lanka, The United Kingdom, South Africa, and Myanmar.The Royal National College for the Blind in the United Kingdom became a Networking Academy in 2014.The abilITy Cisco Networking Academy in New York offered by the Institute for Career Development (ICD) became the first IT training program for people with disabilities in the United States in 2018.These are just a few of our partners doing great work to make the Networking Academy Program available to people with disabilities worldwide.Impact mattersHow are we tracking against the commitment we made five years ago to train 10,000 people with disabilities? Since we activated voluntary self-reporting in fiscal 2019, as many as 153,000 students have declared disabilities. Our work in this focused area continues to evolve and we're honored to make an even greater impact.Meet some of our inspirational Networking Academy graduates and instructors with disabilities:Jacques, from the United States, not only achieved CCNA certification as part of his degree program at College of DuPage, but went on to complete a Master's program. He was recently awarded American Airforce Association CyberPatriot XIII Mentor of the Year.Jacques found his passion for technology after his vision started to change, and succeeded in part because he learned to ask what tools were available to help. He now works as a Cybersecurity and Incident Response Analyst at United Airlines.Tyler was working as a relief cook when the pandemic struck, and it made him realize he wanted to change his career. With assistance from Massachusetts Rehabilitation Commission, he overcame his learning difficulties to study the Cisco Cybersecurity Associate Program at Holyoke Community College. Tyler is now Lead Associate of Tech Development at an IT solutions provider, where he instructs interns in basic PC function, PC builds and networking, as well as basic cybersecurity. He hopes to earn a degree. ""Having a disability shouldn't limit or define your capabilities….It's taking me longer than most to achieve what I'd like but I'll get there eventually,"" he says.Juan, from Peru, had an interest in computers from a young age. Despite his hearing impairment, Juan found his home with Cisco Networking Academy. ""When I joined the Cisco Networking Academy, the practical approach they had in their digital courses made my learning experience so much easier,"" he says.He felt so strongly about the curriculum he now works as a Cisco CCNA instructor, and as an IT Supervisor for another company. Check out Juan's story in the video above.A different way of perceiving things may give Richard, from the United States, an advantage in cybersecurity as a Senior Analyst. Being neurodivergent could have presented a challenge in his education. With assistance from the Massachusetts Rehabilitation Commission and Holyoke Community College, Richard achieved both Cisco Certified CyberOps Associate and Cisco Certified Network Associate accreditation.""The Cisco Cybersecurity training gave me the knowledge, especially in the data and privacy space, to succeed at work, and I recommend the program to anyone considering it,"" he says.Fabien, from France, studied for his CCNA and Introduction to Cybersecurity at Lycée Cabanis with the help of a French sign language interpreter. He transitioned from work in building maintenance and as an electrician to running his own IT contracting, networking administration, and coaching company.""I am very proud to succeed in networking as a hearing-impaired person.
