1,d4843779-2b18-3162-8b94-2b6d52956336,TXN,2022-10-09,7 Dividend Stocks That Are Too Cheap to Ignore,InvestorPlace,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/7-dividend-stocks-too-cheap-112650609.html,1665055610,STORY,"['TXN', 'JNJ', 'FAST', 'UPS', 'RHI', 'SAP']","[With the massive paradigm shifts that erupted this year, more investors look toward cheap dividend stocks to buy. As inflationary forces diminished the dollar’s purchasing power in the first half of this year, many sought to arrest this trajectory through passive income. And while the Federal Reserve intends to effectively introduce deflationary forces by raising the benchmark interest rate, the underlying chaos still makes dividend payers look good.Another reason to consider cheap dividend stocks is that they offer stability at a discount. While it’s unfair to make blanket statements, companies pay dividends from their profits. Naturally, this circumstance implies earnings generation, meaning they’re not purely growth driven. Therefore, businesses with solid track records should be able to weather storms better than non-passive-income providers.Finally, many may question the word “cheap” in cheap dividend stocks. For that, I will rely on valuation metrics and implied value against forward-looking industry or business-specific fundamentals.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsIt’s not an exact science, but I’m going to throw some quantifiable reasoning here. And with that, here are seven cheap dividend stocks to consider.JNJJohnson &amp; Johnson$165.11SAPSAP$87.18TXNTexas Instruments$167.80FASTFastenal$48.13RHIRobert Half$79.66TROWT. Rowe Price$111.54UPSUnited Parcel Service$167.93Johnson &amp; Johnson (JNJ)Why Johnson &amp; Johnson Stock is Clearly Set to Rise AgainSource: ShutterstockJohnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) is a global household name representing a pharmaceutical giant featuring several over-the-counter products. Undergirding an investment profile that caters to everyday necessities, JNJ is a smart buy, no matter the circumstances. However, with the present chaos in the market, it makes for one of the best cheap dividend stocks to buy.For one thing, you can look at the company’s year-to-date performance in the equity price charts. JNJ is down about 3.7%, which arguably belies its all-around pertinence. More importantly, the underlying firm provides a decent forward yield of 2.74%. Perhaps not the most remarkable figure, it does exceed the median yield of 1.58% for the healthcare segment.Story continuesAccording to Gurufocus.com, JNJ is fairly valued. Fair enough. However, Johnson &amp; Johnson features financial strengths across the board. The company enjoys balance sheet stability, solid growth metrics, and excellent profitability indicators. Since stability commands a fundamental premium during these tumultuous times, JNJ ranks among the cheap dividend stocks to buy.SAP (SAP)SAP sign is seen at SAP SuccessFactors Global Headquarters in South San Francisco, CaliforniaSource: Tada Images / Shutterstock.comA German multinational software company, SAP (NYSE:SAP), represents a stalwart of stability in the global business ecosystem. It plays a critical role in the efficient flow of supply chains. Ironically, the coronavirus pandemic disrupted such business networks, leading to sharp corporate losses. In turn, the red ink filtered down SAP’s ability to generate income.Investors can see the damage for themselves. Since the start of the year, SAP stock has slipped nearly 38%. Still, for the contrarian, the crimson ink may represent an opportunity. As well, per the subject of this article on cheap dividend stocks to buy, SAP offers passive income. Specifically, it provides a forward yield of 2.38%. In contrast, the technology sector’s average yield sits at 1.37%.Gurufocus.com labels SAP stock as modestly undervalued. As with JNJ, SAP enjoys solid financials across the board, including solid growth metrics and a stable balance sheet. Perhaps most notably, SAP features a forward price-earnings ratio of 14.3x. The software industry’s median forward PE stands at 22x.Texas Instruments (TXN)Texas Instruments logo on its world headquarters located in Dallas, Texas.Source: Katherine Welles / Shutterstock.comA technology firm, Texas Instruments (NASDAQ:TXN), specializes in designing and manufacturing semiconductors. As well the company focuses on the development of integrated circuits. Of course, because of the severe disruption of the Covid-19 pandemic, few eagerly touch semiconductor investments like TXN stock. That might be a mistake in the long run.To be fair, TXN initially presents an uninviting profile, shedding over 13% YTD. Over the trailing year, it’s down a bit more at a loss of nearly 15%. Still, these represent far superior numbers than the underlying benchmark tech index. In addition, TXN separates itself from other tech plays by offering passive income. It features a forward yield of 3%, above the average industry yield of 1.4%.Notably, Gurufocus.com labels TXN as modestly undervalued. Per the resource’s proprietary valuation metrics, it views Texas Instruments as an excellent all-around investment. Most significantly, the company enjoys a net margin of nearly 44%, above approximately 98% of other tech firms. Therefore, TXN ranks easily among the best cheap dividend stocks to buy.Fastenal (FAST)Fastenal (FAST) logo displayed on a mobile phoneSource: IgorGolovniov / Shutterstock.comFocused on industrial supplies, Fastenal (NASDAQ:FAST) represents the largest fastener distributor in North America, per its website. Still, this impressive status also points to significant risks. Should the Fed’s hawkish monetary policy inadvertently slip the U.S. economy into recession, Fastenal brings an uncertain outlook. I’m not saying this to be negative on FAST stock. It’s just a risk factor to acknowledge.Another danger to FAST stems from broader market volatility. Since the start of the year through the Oct. 4 session, Fastenal dropped 22% in equity value. However, contrarians might consider this an opportunity for an eventual economic comeback. To be fair, FAST doesn’t represent one of the most generous cheap dividend stocks. Still, its forward yield of 2.58% beats the industry average of 2.36%.Moving onto Gurufocus.com, it labels Fastenal’s business as modestly undervalued. Per the investment resource, the company commands excellent growth and profitability metrics. As well, its books are stable. For instance, Fastenal’s equity-to-asset ratio stands at 0.69, beating nearly 85% of sector peers.Robert Half (RHI)The Robert Half International logo on the website homepageSource: Casimiro PT / Shutterstock.comAn employment services agency, Robert Half (NYSE:RHI), connects professional talent with hiring enterprises. It then acts as a middleman entity, collecting fees for its services. While many may criticize Robert Half for “fleecing the flock,” the reality is that not all companies have the resources to hire qualified talent. Therefore, they outsource the (often cumbersome) process to firms like Robert Half.Still, with Covid-19 imposing strange dynamics in the employer-employee relationship, RHI stock suffered from relevancy loss. Therefore, RHI slipped 27% YTD. Anecdotally, I’m almost sure that these strange dynamics will correct themselves. At the end of the day, employers sign the checks. Employees must either put up or shut up. This statement is harsh, but it’s also a reality.Let’s look to Gurufocus.com for some numbers. RHI rates as modestly undervalued. Arguably, the company’s highlight financial metric is its return-on-equity of nearly 50%, blasting the industry median of 8.6%. RHI also features a forward yield of 2.16%, which isn’t great. However, the combo of likely surging relevance (from desperate workers amid a possible recession) bolsters the case for RHI as one of the cheap dividend stocks to buy.T. Rowe Price (TROW)T row price (TROW) logo magnified through a lens while displayed on a web browserSource: Pavel Kapysh / Shutterstock.comAn investment management firm, T. Rowe Price (NASDAQ:TROW), may immediately appear to be one of the cheap dividend stocks. However, critics may argue that it’s for the wrong reasons. As an investment management firm, T. Rowe performed well through 2021. The reason? Inflation, baby! With the greenback’s purchasing power guaranteed (under the dovish monetary ecosystem) to decline, investors have an active incentive to invest. Otherwise, the dollar’s value goes into the toilet.Under a deflationary system – that is, rising purchasing power – the incentive flips on its head. Essentially, if investors do nothing and sit on cash, they enjoy a guaranteed positive return of relative wealth. Thus, any investment opportunity must be so compelling that people will give up guaranteed returns. On a related note, that’s the reason why, arguably, most folks hate deflationary cycles.Not surprisingly, then, Gurufocus.com considers TROW significantly undervalued. Still, contrarian investors may appreciate the opportunity as the underlying company features its industry’s top-level growth and profitability metrics. In addition, T. Rowe features a forward yield of 4.24%.United Parcel Service (UPS)Envelopes with UPS logo on them. UPS stock.Source: monticello / ShutterstockIf you thought buying the above idea for cheap dividend stocks was extremely risky, look at United Parcel Service (NYSE:UPS). I don’t want to spend too much time beating a dead horse. However, the consumer economy suffered badly this year. As a result, a rival courier service disclosed terrible pre-earnings figures that sent shockwaves throughout the market in September.Understandably, UPS finds itself in the crosshairs. Nevertheless, its performance isn’t too awful, losing about 21% YTD in the price charts. Fundamentally, the hesitation is understandable given that the ratio of e-commerce sales relative to total retail sales has diminished conspicuously since the Covid peak. Nevertheless, the ratio did pick up in the second quarter of this year.For the extreme contrarian seeking cheap dividend stocks, Gurufocus.com labels UPS modestly undervalued. Despite incoming challenges, the company currently stands strong regarding growth and profitability metrics. The deflated equity value and the forward yield of 3.6% might make shares worthwhile for gamblers.On the date of publication, Josh Enomoto did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.A former senior business analyst for Sony Electronics, Josh Enomoto has helped broker major contracts with Fortune Global 500 companies.

Brent crude skyrocketed to around $130 before steadily declining – but that was likely due to the soaring prices for oil products, not oil itself, Rats said to CNBC on Friday.He noted that gas prices peaked at $180 a barrel and diesel prices peaked at $190 a barrel before the market began to see demand destruction – which suggests current prices have room to rise before hitting a critical point.""From that perspective, we are nowhere near prices that cause demand destruction. From that perspective, there is room to rally again,"" Rats said.He noted there are three factors facing the oil market that would likely drive prices higher.The first is OPEC's recent announcement of a production cut. The cartel on Wednesday they would slash oil production by two million barrels a day – a major blow to the global energy market, as OPEC+ supplies around 40% of the world's oil consumption.Second, the US Strategic Petroleum Reserve releases are winding down, with excess supply the US has brought to the market since April set to dry up this month.Finally, there are heightened odds of disruptions to Russia supplies. Russian oil exports have been falling ahead of the European Union ban on Russian oil, which are set to kick in by the end of the year. The nation has also threatened to slash oil production in response to a planned price cap on Russian oil by G7 nations. If the Kremlin goes through with a production cut, that will put more stress on the global oil supply, likely pushing prices higher.""All of that is coming together over the next couple of weeks, or month or two, and when those things come together I think that will put upward pressure on prices again,"" Rats said.Read the original article on Business Insider]"

I wish I knew. But since there’s no way to know with complete certainty, investors must be prepared for multiple outcomes going forward. It’s why I suggest always keeping a list of must-buy stocks.More than just knowing what stocks to buy, investors should know when they want to buy them and for what price. For instance, I want to buy shares of “ABC in a bear-market panic at $X a share.”That gives us a clear plan of attack — even if we never make it to that particular battle.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsThe risk in not buying a stock today in hopes of a lower price tomorrow is that that price may never come. However, the risk of buying now is clear, too, as a continued decline will hammer its value.By having a few stocks outlined at specific prices, we can avoid some of these headaches. We can also get a great deal on some must-buy stocks and do so with much less emotional turmoil.CRMSalesforce$156.23PANWPalo Alto Networks$175.65GOOGL, GOOGAlphabet$101.43, $102.22Salesforce (CRM)A hand with pink painted fingernails holds a Salesforce sticker.Source: Bjorn Bakstad / Shutterstock.comSalesforce (NYSE:CRM) has already come down significantly in price, with shares suffering a peak-to-trough decline of 53.9%. However, should we see a bit more downside, I’m pretty interested.Specifically, I’m looking to see if the stock falls into the $120s. If so, I think it’s one long-term growth investors need to snatch up.While the company’s earnings did take a bit of a hit due to the economic volatility we’re experiencing — after not experiencing any issues earlier in the year — growth here remains robust.Analysts expect 17% revenue growth this year and 14.7% growth in 2024. While earnings growth is forecast to be flat this year, analysts expect 20% growth next year. All told, shares trade at about 30x this year’s earnings and 26x estimates for next year.More important than all of that, though, is the company’s recent projection, which calls for revenue of $50 billion in FY 2026. Keep in mind that it’s operating in FY 2023 right now and is forecast to generate $31 billion in sales this year. Thus, Salesforce isn’t anywhere near slowing down.Story continuesPalo Alto Networks (PANW)Palo Alto Networks (PANW) logo on corporate buildingSource: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.comAs volatility in the stock market and economy continues to accelerate, so too do cybercrimes.

When it most recently reported earnings, the company delivered a top- and bottom-line beat for its fiscal Q4. However, it also provided full-year guidance ahead of analysts’ expectations.The stock isn’t cheap, but should it be?With this type of growth — analysts expect earnings and revenue growth of roughly 25% this year and 20% next year, respectively — should it trade at a discount? I don’t think so.I’m eyeing two areas on the chart for Palo Alto Networks: $127 to $133 and sub-$110. The first zone is a retest of the 2021 breakout area.

The company is tied to global and domestic economies. If there’s a significant slowdown — in other words, a recession — then ad revenue and ad margins will take a hit.There’s no other way to put it. However, that doesn’t mean Alphabet should be sold relentlessly.It owns the two most popular websites, Google.com and YouTube.com. That’s like owning Boardwalk and Park Place in Monopoly. It has a fortress balance sheet and monstrous free cash flow to boot.Simply put, a short-term slowdown should not discourage long-term investors. Painfully, Alphabet came quite close to hitting our $90 to $92 buy target (with a preference toward $90). There we find a key retracement measure, breakout area, and the 200-week moving average. Not to mention, the stock has already suffered a terrible pullback, with a peak-to-trough loss of 37%. That’s the stock’s most significant decline in the last 12 years — even outpacing its decline during March 2020.Lastly, Alphabet has only suffered three pullbacks in excess of 30% in the last dozen years, and this has been the worst one. The other two were major opportunities. Long-term investors can rest assured that this one will be too. Thus, Alphabet is among the top must-buy stocks.On the date of publication, Bret Kenwell did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

10,f3583f1e-f251-3d1d-b2ec-42e44e130385,CRM,2022-10-09,7 Growth Stocks That Are Too Cheap to Ignore,InvestorPlace,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/7-growth-stocks-too-cheap-172212191.html,1664990532,STORY,"['TSLA', 'GOOGL', 'SPOT', 'DOCU', 'CRM', 'CHPT', 'SQ']","[Simply described, growth stocks are the shares of companies that are growing faster than the average company on the stock market. These are often the stocks of start-up companies that are  expanding quickly and rapidly gaining market share. While growth stocks are often depressed when the market is down, for outsized gains, there are few alternatives to growth stocks. Given the decline of stock prices in recent months, many growth stocks are now available at deep discounts. However, when the bull market returns, these names will rebound sharply. Here are seven cheap growth stocks that are too attractive to ignore.GOOG,GOOGLAlphabet$103,$102CRMSalesforce$156TSLATesla$242.70SPOTSpotify$92.30SQBlock$62.50CHPTChargePoint$15.70DOCUDocuSign$52.30Alphabet (GOOG,GOOGL)GOOG stock: letters spelling out googleSource: rvlsoft / Shutterstock.comAlphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) is so much more than an online search engine today. The parent company of Google is diversified and offers a range of cutting-edge products that include smartphones and smart watches, as well as online home assistants. Many of its offerings utilize artificial intelligence.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsThe California-based company remains a leader when it comes to pushing the technology envelope. And GOOGL stock has now reached its most affordable level since the company went public in 2004.A 20-for-1 stock split executed in July brought the price of GOOGL stock down to around $135 from more than $1,800 previously. However, the share price has been dragged lower amid this year’s tech wreck and after the company signaled that online advertising is slowing.The result is that investors can now buy GOOGL stock for $99 a share. Over the long term, the company’s return on investment is likely to be massive. Since its initial public offering 18 years ago, Alphabet’s stock has returned more than 3,500% to the investors who held onto its shares for all those years.Story continuesSalesforce (CRM)A hand with pink painted fingernails holds a Salesforce sticker.Source: Bjorn Bakstad / Shutterstock.comAnother leading technology company and growth stock that has been pushed lower this year is cloud computing giant Salesforce (NYSE:CRM). In 2022, CRM stock has fallen  39% to $155.82 per share.The San Francisco-based company’s stock has been hurt by investors fleeing to the safety of more cyclical blue-chip names and by weak forward guidance that indicates its growth is starting to slow. However, there are reasons for investors to remain optimistic about Salesforce’s long-term outlook.In August, Salesforce issued quarterly results that beat Wall Street’s forecasts, highlighted by earnings per share of $1.19, which handily beat analysts’ average EPS estimate  of $1.02. Additionally, the company announced that it was undertaking its first-ever share buyback program with plans to repurchase  $10 billion of its own stock.While its forward guidance was weaker than had been expected, Salesforce’s management said that it plans to lift the prices that it charges for the Slack team communications app that it acquired last year.Tesla (TSLA)Tesla Motors (TSLA) now an SP500 company with a busy Pond Springs location in northwest Austin, TXSource: Roschetzky Photography / Shutterstock.comWith the drama surrounding Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) seemingly put to bed, Elon Musk can now, hopefully, turn his focus back to Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA), the world’s leading manufacturer of electric vehicles.While it can no longer be considered a start-up, Tesla remains in aggressive growth mode. In the last year alone, the company has opened massive new manufacturing plants in Austin, Texas and Berlin, Germany, and expanded its existing plant in Shanghai, China. The company also continues to push into new frontiers ranging from solar panels to humanoid robots.It’s all part of Musk’s vision for our collective future, and it is the reason why Tesla remains one of the best cheap growth stocks to own.Like many tech stocks, TSLA shares split on a 3-for-1 basis in August this year. It was the second split in as many years for the stock and brought the price down to under $250 a share.However, aside from the split, the shares of Tesla have declined 32% in 2022, providing an attractive entry point for investors at their current level of $240. Its price-earnings ratio is still on the high side at 87.But keep in mind that its P/E ratio was sitting above 200 at the outset of the pandemic.Spotify Technology (SPOT)Spotify (SPOT) logo is on the screen of a smartphone with headphones plugged in.Source: Kaspars Grinvalds / Shutterstock.comSwedish company Spotify Technology (NYSE:SPOT) is the undisputed king of audio streaming. It is a fast-growing company that is dominant in most of the markets in which it operates.However, the company’s lack of profitability has hurt its share price, pushing it down 61% so far this year to $92.30.However, while profits remain elusive for SPOT, the numbers show that it is heading in the right direction.In the second quarter, Spotify reported that its monthly active users had jumped 19% year-over-year and 3% versus Q1 to 433 million. The company has a goal to reach 1 billion monthly active users by 2030.As music streaming and podcasts grow in popularity, Spotify has continued to aggressively expand. Today the company and its service are available in every country around the world except for China.As a result, Spotify now generates more than $10 billion a year in revenues, with the vast majority of that money coming from monthly subscriptions. The company is working to diversify and generate new revenue streams, most recently by entering the audio-book space. If all goes according to plan, Spotify should turn a profit by the end of this year and should start generating consistent profits in 2023.Block (SQ)The logo for Block is shown on a phone screen with the company's old name and logo, Square, visible behind the phone.Source: Sergei Elagin / Shutterstock.comIt’s not without risk and many investors would be unable to handle its volatility, but for those who can be patient and stomach near-term losses, then financial technology (fintech) company Block (NYSE:SQ) could be a good growth stock to buy at current levels. Formerly known as Square, Block is the company behind the popular payment system that enables small-and-medium businesses to accept credit and debit card payments and use smartphones for point-of-sale transactions.Square co-founder Jack Dorsey rebranded the company as Block to reflect its growing push into cryptocurrencies, a risky proposition that is largely responsible for SQ stock being down 61% this year.At its current price of $62.50 a share, SQ stock looks very cheap. At the depths of the pandemic, when so many merchants were turning to Block’s technology to help facilitate online payments, the stock was trading near $300 a share.The decline since last November has been largely due to Dorsey’s push into the volatile cryptocurrency market. The company currently holds more than 8,000 Bitcoin (BTC-USD) tokens worth more than $150 million. That has made many investors think twice about buying SQ stock. However, the company’s core payments business continues to grow and expand at a brisk pace.ChargePoint (CHPT)EV stocks: A close-up shot of a ChargePoint charging station.Source: YuniqueB / Shutterstock.comWith the Biden administration’s hard fought climate change legislation officially passed, the long-awaited buildout of electric vehicle infrastructure is expected to begin in earnest.And this benefits  California-based ChargePoint (NYSE:CHPT), the biggest manufacturer of electric vehicle charging stations in the world.  The Biden administration has allocated $900 million to install electric vehicle charging stations in 34 states and Puerto Rico. The President has said publicly that he wants EV chargers to be “as easy to find as gas stations are now.”This will be a boom for ChargePoint, which operates the largest network of independent EV charging stations in the world, spanning 14 countries. The American company is expected to further benefit as other countries around the world ramp up their investments in the infrastructure that is needed to achieve more widespread adoption of electric vehicles.With most major automakers planning to switch their fleets to EVs by 2030, the demand for the charging stations made by ChargePoint will only grow in coming years. Currently, CHPT stock, which has tumbled 18% this year, can be bought for $15,70 a share.DocuSign (DOCU)Docusign (DOCU) logo on buildingSource: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.comWhile it is true that we’ve returned to the office, much of our work life has migrated online for good from video conferences to team-chat functions. The same can be said for the electronic management of contracts and signatures. Basically, people no longer need to be face-to-face to sign a contract and finalize a deal or agreement.Companies such as DocuSign (NASDAQ:DOCU) have made it possible for contracts and signatures to be managed from anywhere in the world, easily and conveniently. Another casualty of the pandemic recovery, DOCU stock has fallen  80% in the past 12 months and now changes hands at $52.30 a share. But the selloff has been overdone based on DocuSign’s financials and future outlook.To be sure, DocuSign has struggled coming out of the Covid-19 crisis. Most recently, the company announced that it was laying off more than 650 employees as part of a cost-cutting plan that will cost as much as $40 million.DocuSign has also announced the appointment of Allan Thygesen, who previously was in charge of online advertisements at Google parent company Alphabet, to be its new CEO. While the current transition at DocuSign has been painful for shareholders, the end result should be a leaner and more nimble company that is poised for future gains.The company estimates that its total addressable market is $50 billion, which should provide plenty of room for continued growth.On the date of publication, Joel Baglole held a long position in GOOGL.

These range from the highest market value of Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) at $2.5 trillion to the lowest — Liberty Latin America Class C (NASDAQ:LILAK) — with a value of around $1.5 billion.If you’re familiar with Warren Buffett’s investing style, you know that the Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRK.B) CEO loves to collect dividends from these companies.The other thing that Buffett really likes is share repurchases. That’s because the company’s share count is reduced, giving shareholders a larger piece of the company without investing any additional funds. InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsSo, it only makes sense when looking for long-term Warren Buffett stocks to buy that you consider companies on the Berkshire Hathaway list that grow their dividends and repurchase shares in a big way.For the purposes of this article, I’ll be selecting seven companies from at least five different sectors who have repurchased at least $500 million of their stock in the latest fiscal year and $300 million in dividends.After all, if these stocks are good enough for Warren Buffett, they ought to be good enough for you. AAPLApple$146.40MCOMoody’s$261.97AXPAmerican Express$144.36HPQHP Inc.$26.81ALLYAlly Financial$30.69KRKroger$44.59AONAon$282.98Apple (AAPL)Apple (AAPL) logo brand and text sign on entrance facade store American multinational boutique corporation dealership shopSource: sylv1rob1 / Shutterstock.comAny list of top long-term Warren Buffett stocks to buy ought to start with Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL). In the latest fiscal year ended Sept. 25, 2021, Apple bought back $86 billion of its stock and paid out $14.5 billion in dividends. From fiscal 2012 through Q3 2022, Apple bought back $529.1 billion of its stock. Over the same period, it paid out $128.2 billion in dividends.Apple currently accounts for 41.1% of the Berkshire Hathaway equity portfolio. Berkshire’s stake in Apple is 5.7%, making this iPhone producer by far the holding company’s largest position. Apple ended the third quarter with net cash of $60 billion.Story continuesDown almost 20% year-to-date through Oct. 4, AAPL stock is trading at 6.1-times sales, its lowest multiple since 2019.BofA Global Research analyst Wamsi Mohan recently suggested that the next year could get ugly for Apple if consumers pull back on their discretionary spending. The analyst feels that the spending slowdown isn’t just with low-end consumers, but has spread to a wider group of people. While that’s a reason to be cautious about your stock purchases, Apple remains a stock to own for the long haul. You shouldn’t be attempting to time the market with this kind of quality stock. If you have money to invest, buy it.Moody’s (MCO)A Moody's Corporation (MCO) sign in silver.Source: Daniel J. Macy / Shutterstock.comIn the latest fiscal year ended Dec. 31, 2021, Moody’s (NYSE:MCO) bought back $750 million of its stock and paid out $463 million in dividends. Moody’s, best known for its credit ratings business, authorized an additional $750 million in share repurchases in February. That’s on top of the $1 billion approved in February 2021. As of June 30, it had $960 million remaining on the authorization. There is no expiration. In February 2019, the company entered into an accelerated stock repurchase program. In total, Moody’s repurchased 2.8 million shares at an average price of $180.33. That’s a 45% return over 43 months. A monthly return of 1% isn’t too shabby. As for dividends, the company has more than doubled its annual payment per share between 2015 ($1.36) and 2022 ($2.80), a compound annual growth rate of 10.9%.Moody’s currently accounts for 2.0% of the Berkshire Hathaway equity portfolio. Berkshire’s stake in the company is 13.4%.

That’s only slightly less than where its stock is currently trading.Amex currently accounts for 6.8% of the Berkshire Hathaway equity portfolio. Berkshire’s stake in the company is 20.2%. It is the holding company’s fifth-largest position. In the second quarter ended June 30, American Express announced its revenues increased 31% to $13.4 billion while its net income fell 8% to $2.57 a share. Due to the success of its premium card products, it added 3.2 million new proprietary cards in the quarter. The company’s management team appears to be more than happy with its quarterly results. As a result, American Express raised its yearly revenue growth guidance from 19% at the midpoint of its range to 24%. On the bottom line, the company maintained its full-year EPS guidance of $9.45. HP (HPQ)Source: Tomasz Wozniak / Shutterstock.comIn the latest fiscal year ended Dec. 31, 2021, HP (NYSE:HPQ) bought back $6.3 billion of its stock and paid out $938 million in dividends. The company’s board authorized the repurchase of an additional $15 billion of its stock in February 2020. It does not have an expiration.

In addition, it raised its quarterly cash dividend to 30 cents a share, a 20% increase over the previous quarter. Through the first six months of 2022, Ally repurchased $1.18 billion of its stock at an average price of $42.93 a share, considerably higher than its current share price. It can do better. Hopefully, it was buying in the third quarter.  Ally accounts for 0.3% of the Berkshire Hathaway equity portfolio. Berkshire’s stake in the company is 9.7%. It is the holding company’s 29th-largest position, but certainly finds itself in many investors’ list of top long-term Warren Buffett stocks to buy. One of the reasons Buffett may continue to own Ally’s stock is its deflated tangible book value per share. At the end of Q2 2022, it was $32.16, down from $38.83 a year earlier, and trading at a discount to its share price.

In June, Kroger increased its quarterly dividend by 24% to 26 cents or $1.04 annually. It was the 16th consecutive year increasing its dividend since it was reinstated in 2006. Through the first six months of 2022, Kroger repurchased $975 million of its stock at an average price of $51.32. That’s 3% higher than the average of its high ($62.78) and low ($42.70) for 2022. That’s a decent, if not spectacular, job of buying back its stock.Kroger accounts for 0.7% of the Berkshire Hathaway equity portfolio. Berkshire’s stake in the company is 7.3%. It is the holding company’s 17th-largest position. In early September, Kroger boosted its annual profit forecast on higher prepared food and private label revenues from increased in-home dining. As a result, the company now expects to earn as much as $4.05 a share, up 10 cents from $3.95. Aon (AON)A photo pf physical representations of cryptocoins above wooden tiles bearing black letters that spell out insurance.Source: Najmi Arif/ShutterStock.comRounding out the list of top long-term Warren Buffett stocks to buy, we have Aon (NYSE:AON). Aon repurchased $3.5 billion of its stock and paid out $447 million in dividends in 2021.  The global leader in commercial risk, health, reinsurance, and wealth solutions, paid an average of $286.82 for each of the 12.4 million shares it repurchased last year. Thanks to 2022’s major correction, it’s a little underwater on those purchases. The company’s board authorized its first share repurchase program in April 2012 for $5 billion. It subsequently added $22.5 billion in buybacks on four occasions since, the most recent, a $7.5 billion bump in February. As of June 30, it had $7.9 billion remaining on its program.Since 2012, the company has repurchased 154.1 million shares of its stock at an average price of $127.19, a return on investment of 124%, or 8% compounded annually. A reasonable, if not lights-out, return on its investment.   In August, Aon moved its Chief Operating Officer, James Platt, into the new role of Chief Digital Officer. Platt oversees the company’s Digital Client Solutions. Replacing Platt as COO is Mindy Simon. She comes over from Conagra Brands, where she was the firm’s Chief Information Officer. Aon continues to build a strong bench of talent. That will be good for shareholder returns down the road. The company accounts for 0.4% of the Berkshire Hathaway equity portfolio. Berkshire’s stake in the company is 2.1%. It is the holding company’s 25th-largest position. On the date of publication, Will Ashworth did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

12,6f756305-0030-3fa0-b8a4-26160b7fdc51,PCG,2022-10-09,PG&E Corporation's (NYSE:PCG) Intrinsic Value Is Potentially 82% Above Its Share Price,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/pg-e-corporations-nyse-pcg-120555721.html,1665317155,STORY,['PCGU'],"[In this article we are going to estimate the intrinsic value of PG&amp;E Corporation (NYSE:PCG) by projecting its future cash flows and then discounting them to today's value. Our analysis will employ the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model. Before you think you won't be able to understand it, just read on! It's actually much less complex than you'd imagine.Companies can be valued in a lot of ways, so we would point out that a DCF is not perfect for every situation. If you still have some burning questions about this type of valuation, take a look at the Simply Wall St analysis model. See our latest analysis for PG&amp;E Crunching The NumbersWe are going to use a two-stage DCF model, which, as the name states, takes into account two stages of growth. The first stage is generally a higher growth period which levels off heading towards the terminal value, captured in the second 'steady growth' period. To start off with, we need to estimate the next ten years of cash flows. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.A DCF is all about the idea that a dollar in the future is less valuable than a dollar today, and so the sum of these future cash flows is then discounted to today's value:10-year free cash flow (FCF) forecast2023202420252026202720282029203020312032 Levered FCF ($, Millions) -US$2.42b-US$2.55b-US$2.34bUS$1.16bUS$1.59bUS$2.01bUS$2.39bUS$2.72bUS$3.00bUS$3.24bGrowth Rate Estimate SourceAnalyst x4Analyst x4Analyst x2Analyst x1Est @ 36.78%Est @ 26.33%Est @ 19.01%Est @ 13.89%Est @ 10.31%Est @ 7.8% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 5.6% -US$2.3k-US$2.3k-US$2.0kUS$936US$1.2kUS$1.5kUS$1.6kUS$1.8kUS$1.8kUS$1.9k(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$4.1bStory continuesWe now need to calculate the Terminal Value, which accounts for all the future cash flows after this ten year period. The Gordon Growth formula is used to calculate Terminal Value at a future annual growth rate equal to the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield of 1.9%. We discount the terminal cash flows to today's value at a cost of equity of 5.6%.Terminal Value (TV)= FCF2032 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$3.2b× (1 + 1.9%) ÷ (5.6%– 1.9%) = US$90bPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$90b÷ ( 1 + 5.6%)10= US$53bThe total value, or equity value, is then the sum of the present value of the future cash flows, which in this case is US$57b. In the final step we divide the equity value by the number of shares outstanding. Relative to the current share price of US$14.9, the company appears quite undervalued at a 45% discount to where the stock price trades currently. Valuations are imprecise instruments though, rather like a telescope - move a few degrees and end up in a different galaxy. Do keep this in mind.dcfThe AssumptionsWe would point out that the most important inputs to a discounted cash flow are the discount rate and of course the actual cash flows. Part of investing is coming up with your own evaluation of a company's future performance, so try the calculation yourself and check your own assumptions. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at PG&amp;E as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 5.6%, which is based on a levered beta of 0.861. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.Moving On:Although the valuation of a company is important, it shouldn't be the only metric you look at when researching a company. DCF models are not the be-all and end-all of investment valuation. Instead the best use for a DCF model is to test certain assumptions and theories to see if they would lead to the company being undervalued or overvalued. For example, changes in the company's cost of equity or the risk free rate can significantly impact the valuation. What is the reason for the share price sitting below the intrinsic value? For PG&amp;E, there are three relevant elements you should look at:Risks: Consider for instance, the ever-present spectre of investment risk.   We've identified 4 warning signs  with PG&amp;E (at least 1 which makes us a bit uncomfortable)  , and understanding them should be part of your investment process.Future Earnings: How does PCG's growth rate compare to its peers and the wider market?

During the second quarter of 2022, the Global Growth Composite Portfolio (the “Portfolio”) was down -18.08% and -18.34% gross and net of fees, respectively, versus a decline of -15.65% for the MSCI ACWI (the “Index”). Since inception, the Portfolio has compounded at an annualized rate of 11.04% and 10.12%, gross and net of fees, versus 6.88% for the Index. Go over the fund’s top 5 positions to have a glimpse of its finest picks for 2022.In its Q2 2022 investor letter, Polen Global Growth mentioned Align Technology, Inc. (NASDAQ:ALGN) and explained its insights for the company. Founded in 1997, Align Technology, Inc. (NASDAQ:ALGN) is a San Jose, California-based orthodontics company with a $17.3 billion market capitalization. Align Technology, Inc. (NASDAQ:ALGN) delivered a -66.16% return since the beginning of the year, while its 12-month returns are down by -66.38%. The stock closed at $222.36 per share on October 06, 2022.Here is what Polen Global Growth has to say about Align Technology, Inc. (NASDAQ:ALGN) in its Q2 2022 investor letter:""Align Technology shares declined significantly during the second quarter when management reported a meaningful deceleration in growth. Management cited a host of challenges, including COVID19 impacts, especially in China with restrictions and lockdowns under their zero-COVID policy, a weaker economic environment, inflationary pressures, supply chain disruptions, and the war in Ukraine, to name a few. Tough comparisons were also a reality— Invisalign case starts in 1Q22 were roughly flat, having lapped the 66% growth from the prior year. It’s not completely surprising that growth is slowing on such tough comparisons, but the company’s shares declined on the news.By looking at Align’s three-year compound average growth rate (CAGR) to smooth out the ups and downs through COVID, key metrics like Invisalign case shipment, clear aligner revenue, and earnings per share have all grown ~20% during the trailing three years. We think this is quite respectable given the challenges during this period, but the lack of near-term momentum or visibility has not been well received in the current environment. According to our research, Align is the clear market leader, has global scale, a superior product, and still very modest market penetration. While growth may be challenged near term, we remain confident in the long-term growth opportunity.""Story continuesSmiling.

15,1cdfa541-6971-3e01-a028-eff56f1e87ef,MRO,2022-10-09,This Is the Best Time to Buy These 4 Long-Term Energy Stocks,InvestorPlace,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/best-time-buy-4-long-195507907.html,1664999707,STORY,"['CVX', 'OXY', 'RIG', 'MRO']","[It’s been a year of windfall profits for oil and gas companies. Indeed, it isn’t surprising that energy stocks have performed well through 2022. Surging oil prices due to supply and demand dislocations have made these companies extremely profitable.That said, oil has started to correct from its highs on global growth concerns. I believe that this correction provides an opportunity to consider adding exposure to long-term energy stocks to buy.It’s worth noting that the U.S. Energy Information Administration believes that Brent oil is likely to average $90 in 2023. The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries also expects oil demand to touch pre-pandemic levels in 2023. Even with some economic concerns, the outlook for the energy sector seems positive.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsFactors such as geo-political tensions are also likely to ensure that oil remains firm over the next few years. Last year, Russell Hardy, CEO of commodity trader Vitol warned of an “oil supply ‘gap’ in 2025-2035 as upstream spending ebbs.” Therefore, even with investors’ focus increasingly on green energy, it’s too early to write-off fossil fuel investments.Let’s therefore talk about four long-term energy stocks to buy for sustained value creation.CVXChevron$159.23OXYOccidental Petroleum$67.89MROMarathon Oil$27.20RIGTransocean$3.00Chevron (CVX)CVX stockSource: tishomir / Shutterstock.comAfter touching 52-week highs of $182, Chevron (NYSE:CVX) stock dipped to as low as $135 per share. However, CVX stock has since bounced back from lows, and at current levels, seems attractive for long-term exposure.An obvious reason to buy CVX stock is this company’s attractive dividend yield of 4%. With an investment-grade balance sheet and strong cash flows, dividend growth seems likely.For Q2 2022, Chevron reported operating cash flow of $13.3 billion. This company’s annual cash flow potential is well over $30 billion (discounting the correction in oil prices). Thus, for those seeking companies valued attractively on a price-to-cash-flow basis, CVX stock is up there with the best.Story continuesAs of 2021, Chevron reported 11.3 billion barrels in proved oil-equivalent reserves. For the last year, the company also reported a robust reserve replacement ratio of 112%. With strong financial flexibility, Chevron is well-positioned to continue to make big investments in exploration. Reserve replacement is therefore likely to remain strong.With a healthy balance sheet, Chevron is also making big investments in renewable energy development. Over the next few years, this segment is likely to positively contribute to growth as well.Occidental PetroleumA magnifying glass zooms in on the Occidental Petroleum website.Source: Pavel Kapysh / Shutterstock.comWarren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRK.B) has continued to load up on shares of Occidental Petroleum (NYSE:OXY). Currently, the investment company holds a 20.9% stake in Occidental. Indeed, wherever the Oracle of Omaha invests is where many investors will start looking for real value.Buffett’s long-term investment in OXY stock is a potential indicator of the value the energy sector is likely to create in the coming years. Of course, there are many reasons why Warren Buffett may be bullish on OXY stock. Occidental has been generating robust cash flows, which are being used to strengthen the company’s credit profile. In Q2 2022 alone, the company retired $4.8 billion debt.With deleveraging, Occidental is positioned to increase shareholder returns as debt servicing costs decline and profits rise. Over the long-term, OXY stock certainly appears compelling as a top dividend growth stock to buy.From an asset perspective, Occidental is also one of the largest acreage holders in the United States. As of December 2021, the company reported 3.5 billion barrels of oil equivalent in proved reserves. A robust reserve base with an attractive break-even cost per barrel ensures stable cash flows in the years to come.Marathon OilMarathon Oil Logo at the top of a mobile device.Source: IgorGolovniov / Shutterstock.comMarathon Oil (NYSE:MRO) stock has surged by 78% in the last 12 months. That said, I still consider this stock to be among the top long-term energy stocks to buy.Marathon Oil has U.S.-focused assets with a strong presence in the Permian, Bakken and Eagle Ford regions, among others. As of December 2021, Marathon reported proved reserves of 1,106 million barrels of oil equivalent. On a year-on-year basis, proved reserves increased by 14%.It’s worth noting that Marathon had guided for free cash flow in excess of $3 billion at $80 WTI. The company however revised the FCF guidance to $4.5 billion in Q2 2022. This was assuming a scenario where WTI is priced at $100 and Henry hub at $6.With robust FCF visibility, Marathon is positioned to increase investments and dividend. On the downside, Marathon expects free cash flows to break even at $35 WTI. Therefore, even if oil were to correct further, there is visibility for positive long-term free cash flows for this company.Overall, Marathon has attractive assets with a low break-even price per barrel. This company’s strong balance sheet provides a long runway for organic growth and potential acquisitions.Transocean (RIG)Transocean logo on a laptop screen. RIG stock.Source: Postmodern Studio / ShutterstockMoving away from oil and gas exploration companies, Transocean (NYSE:RIG) is attractive among offshore rig providers. The stock has corrected by almost 38% in the last six-months. However, this correction seems overdone, as the company encounters a number of positive business catalysts.As an overview, Transocean has a fleet of 39 floaters with 100% focus on harsh environment and ultra-deep water ships. As of September 2022, Transocean reported an order backlog of $7.4 billion. This backlog provides clear cash flow visibility for the next two years.With oil above $80 per barrel, Transocean has been able to secure recent contracts at a higher day-rate. Thus, EBITDA margin expansion is likely in 2023 and beyond.It’s also worth noting that Transocean has a liquidity buffer of $1.9 billion. With visibility for positive cash flows, the company is positioned to deleverage.With a high-quality fleet, strong backlog and improving credit metrics, RIG stock is attractive after a deep correction.On the date of publication, Faisal Humayun did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

16,40bd81be-6cd6-3f79-9da5-6cd3ee3555e4,MRO,2022-10-09,3 Oil Stocks That Are Too Cheap to Ignore,InvestorPlace,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/3-oil-stocks-too-cheap-123856862.html,1664973536,STORY,"['^GSPC', 'MRO', 'CVX', 'VET']","[Oil stocks are doing great in the current market environment. With demand still strong and supply constrained, these companies have plenty of opportunity to make money hand over fist even if prices dip below $80 per barrel. Moreover, cheap oil stocks offer a great way to diversify your portfolio. I believe that even though they have seen some volatility in the market, the oil will continue as an essential part of our world and economy.This year’s narrative for cheap oil stocks is centered on the Russia/Ukraine conflict and the resulting energy crisis. Moreover, with Ukraine gaining momentum in the war, we may see an even more aggressive stance from the Kremlin. Therefore, oil stocks will likely be incredible bets for the foreseeable future.From an economic standpoint, oil prices, for the most part, tend to be price inelastic. Inelastic demand is when demand doesn’t fluctuate much, given a price change. Base demands for oil tend to be inelastic despite consumer sentiment. Having said that, let’s look at three cheap oil stocks that could provide plenty of value to your portfolio.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsCVXChevron$157.63MROMarathon Oil$26.50VETVermilion Energy$23.83Chevron (CVX)Chevron logo on blue sign in front of skyscraper buildingSource: Jeff Whyte / Shutterstock.comIntegrated oil and gas giant Chevron (NYSE:CVX) has been a great investment this year. Its shares have surged over 20% in a year where the S&amp;P 500 has tanked to historic lows. It’s been capitalizing on higher energy prices, enabling it to produce a robust free cash flow (or FCF). Consequently, it has more money to allocate to investors and has done a brilliant job of utilizing its cash to grow value for its stockholders. Though it’s held up well this year, it trades roughly 15% to 20% lower than its intrinsic value.Chevron remains arguably the best long-term investment in the sphere. As discussed by its CFO, Pierre Breber, its priority is to “invest and grow both traditional and new energy.” Accordingly, it’s investing 80% more in advancing its investments in the first half of this year compared to the prior-year period.Story continuesIn addition to its traditional business, it invests in its low-carbon segment. It is already one of the leading producers of renewable fuels with its $3 billion acquisition of Renewable Energy Group. These investments, however, haven’t impacted its robust dividend profile, which boasts a 3.60% yield with 34 consecutive years of dividend payout growth.Marathon Oil (MRO)Marathon Oil gas station carport on sunny day with blue sky backgroundSource: Jonathan Weiss/shutterstock.comMarathon Oil (NYSE:MRO) is a leading oil and gas exploration and production firm. It’s had an incredible 12 months on the back of stellar results from the energy sector. In the process, MRO has significantly increased its free cash flows and capital return policies, enabling it to become remarkably profitable despite scaling down over the past ten years.Marathon has been a cash-generating machine in the past couple of years. It earned a whopping FCF of over 1.3 billion in the second quarter. That number has jumped over 24%, with the renewed strength in the market. Hence, it expects to wrap up the year with a mind-boggling $4.5 billion in FCF.The most attractive element of MRO is its friendly and clear-cut shareholder rewards program. Its policies are primarily geared towards share repurchases over dividends, though, with it buying $760 million in shares in the second quarter. Nevertheless, it yields a relatively strong 1.4%. Despite its rock-solid results, its stock trades at just 1.9 forward sales, significantly lower than its 5-year average.Vermilion Energy (VET)Offshore oil rig near Harlingen, Nederlande. Oil producing is a major economic factor in the Netherlands.Source: travelview / Shutterstock.comVermilion Energy (NYSE:VET) is a Canadian oil and gas producer operating in North America, Europe, and Australia. Its stock has been bid up recently for its substantial exposure to European natural gas. Its acquisition of a larger stake in the Corrib gas project is set to pay off significantly next year.Vermilion had previously projected it would make $1.5 billion in FCF in 2023 and $1.2 billion in 2024 at current prices when oil prices were on the move. However, with the rising natural gas prices, it is poised to make significantly more, resulting in higher returns for its stockholders. Moreover, natural gas prices in the European region are expected to be over four times the price of oil next year and roughly three times the following year, which bodes remarkably well for VET stock over the long term. However, that upside hasn’t been priced in, which makes VET an incredible wager over the next couple of years.On the date of publication, Muslim Farooque did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

Based on this payment, the dividend yield for the company will be 1.2%, which is fairly typical for the industry. See our latest analysis for Microsoft Microsoft's Dividend Is Well Covered By EarningsWe aren't too impressed by dividend yields unless they can be sustained over time. However, Microsoft's earnings easily cover the dividend. This means that most of its earnings are being retained to grow the business.Looking forward, earnings per share is forecast to rise by 43.2% over the next year. Assuming the dividend continues along recent trends, we think the payout ratio could be 20% by next year, which is in a pretty sustainable range.historic-dividendMicrosoft Has A Solid Track RecordThe company has a sustained record of paying dividends with very little fluctuation. Since 2012, the annual payment back then was $0.80, compared to the most recent full-year payment of $2.72. This implies that the company grew its distributions at a yearly rate of about 13% over that duration. Rapidly growing dividends for a long time is a very valuable feature for an income stock.The Dividend Looks Likely To GrowThe company's investors will be pleased to have been receiving dividend income for some time. We are encouraged to see that Microsoft has grown earnings per share at 24% per year over the past five years. A low payout ratio gives the company a lot of flexibility, and growing earnings also make it very easy for it to grow the dividend.We Really Like Microsoft's DividendOverall, a dividend increase is always good, and we think that Microsoft is a strong income stock thanks to its track record and growing earnings. Earnings are easily covering distributions, and the company is generating plenty of cash. Taking this all into consideration, this looks like it could be a good dividend opportunity.Story continuesMarket movements attest to how highly valued a consistent dividend policy is compared to one which is more unpredictable. Still, investors need to consider a host of other factors, apart from dividend payments, when analysing a company.

And if you believe that the stock is really worth $237.80, then there isn’t much room for the share price grow beyond what it’s currently trading. Is there another opportunity to buy low in the future? Since Netflix’s share price is quite volatile, we could potentially see it sink lower (or rise higher) in the future, giving us another chance to buy. This is based on its high beta, which is a good indicator for how much the stock moves relative to the rest of the market.Can we expect growth from Netflix?earnings-and-revenue-growthFuture outlook is an important aspect when you’re looking at buying a stock, especially if you are an investor looking for growth in your portfolio. Although value investors would argue that it’s the intrinsic value relative to the price that matter the most, a more compelling investment thesis would be high growth potential at a cheap price. Netflix's earnings over the next few years are expected to increase by 36%, indicating a highly optimistic future ahead. This should lead to more robust cash flows, feeding into a higher share value.What This Means For YouAre you a shareholder? NFLX’s optimistic future growth appears to have been factored into the current share price, with shares trading around its fair value. However, there are also other important factors which we haven’t considered today, such as the track record of its management team. Have these factors changed since the last time you looked at the stock? Will you have enough confidence to invest in the company should the price drop below its fair value?Story continuesAre you a potential investor? If you’ve been keeping tabs on NFLX, now may not be the most advantageous time to buy, given it is trading around its fair value. However, the positive outlook is encouraging for the company, which means it’s worth diving deeper into other factors such as the strength of its balance sheet, in order to take advantage of the next price drop.With this in mind, we wouldn't consider investing in a stock unless we had a thorough understanding of the risks.

If you want to see some more of the most valuable internet companies today versus 2000, go directly to 5 Most Valuable Internet Companies in 2000 vs. Today.The 10 most valuable internet companies have changed a lot since 22 years ago.Back in 2000, the internet was much smaller than what it is today. Globally, there were only around 413 million internet users.It was also much slower with many people using dialup.In 2000, most people also accessed the internet through either a PC or laptop. Popular apps like Facebook did not exist. The iPhone was not invented either. Cloud computing was mainly just a theory rather than reality.80% of people used Internet Explorer and Google Chrome did not exist.The 5 most popular sites back in 2000 included Yahoo.com, AOL.com, Geocities.com, MSN.com, and Lycos.com.Today, the internet is much larger with several billion more users.The internet is also much faster for many given 5G.Due to mobile phones, internet companies also do a lot more than just internet now. With the internet, people can work at home. They can do shopping, or they can watch TV or even movies.In terms of the 5 most popular sites, Yahoo.com and MSN.com still have a lot of users and the other sites have not done very well.The demographics of the people who use the internet have also changed. While many people in China weren't online in 2000, hundreds of millions of Chinese are online today. As a result of the demographic change, some of the world's most valuable internet companies are Chinese while none were Chinese in 2000.As a result of the huge growth of the internet as well as inflation, the 10 most valuable internet companies today are collectively worth a lot more than what they were collectively worth in 2000.The 10th most valuable company today is worth over $80 billion, for example, versus around $2.1 billion in 2000. Meanwhile the most valuable company today is worth almost $1.3 trillion versus $94.2 billion in 2000.Story continuesThe composition of the most valuable companies in 2000 versus today has also changed substantially. Aside from Amazon, every other company in the top 10 in 2000 isn't in the top 10 today. Some of the top internet companies back in 2000 did not do very well in terms of their stock performance also.The change illustrates how quickly the internet has evolved over time and how successful Amazon has really been in terms of growing its businesses.In terms of the future, it is very likely that the internet will continue to evolve with potentially several new top ten companies. Companies in India, which has a population that will be bigger than China soon, could also potentially make it into the top ten sometime in the future.The internet could also be more about virtual reality or augmented reality in the future. As a result, some companies that offer entirely new services that don't even exist today could also be in the top 10.If existing internet companies are well run, their values could continue to increase. Companies like Amazon.com that were in the top 10 in 2000 and 2022 could still potentially be in the top 10 in 2042 if it continues to grow quickly and innovate.Best Fintech Startups Investors are Flocking ToPhoto by Campaign Creators on UnsplashMethodologyFor the market caps of internet companies today, we took the top 20 internet companies from Statista as of June 2022 and we reranked them based on the market caps as of October 7.

29,06e7c3f7-b393-35b6-a532-423c58dc4264,NFLX,2022-10-09,Here’s Why Polen Capital Liquidated its Netflix (NFLX) Position in the Second Quarter,Insider Monkey,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/why-polen-capital-liquidated-netflix-180839723.html,1665252519,STORY,['NFLX'],"[Polen Capital, an investment management firm, published its “Polen Global Growth Fund” second quarter 2022 investor letter – a copy of which can be downloaded here. During the second quarter of 2022, the Global Growth Composite Portfolio (the “Portfolio”) was down -18.08% and -18.34% gross and net of fees, respectively, versus a decline of -15.65% for the MSCI ACWI (the “Index”). Since inception, the Portfolio has compounded at an annualized rate of 11.04% and 10.12%, gross and net of fees, versus 6.88% for the Index. Go over the fund’s top 5 positions to have a glimpse of its finest picks for 2022.In its Q2 2022 investor letter, Polen Global Growth mentioned Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) and explained its insights for the company. Founded in 1997, Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) is a Los Gatos, California-based subscription streaming service and production company with a $106.7 billion market capitalization. Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) delivered a -60.16% return since the beginning of the year, while its 12-month returns are down by -62.01%. The stock closed at $240.02 per share on October 06, 2022.Here is what Polen Global Growth has to say about Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) in its Q2 2022 investor letter:""After taking a small initial position in Netflix in the first quarter, we liquidated our position during the second quarter. During the first quarter of ownership, Netflix management reported weakerthan-expected new subscriber growth, provided very tempered guidance, and highlighted a host of challenges. Beyond the challenging comparisons from the prior year, which were expected, management noted the economic environment, increasing competition, and higher market penetration. All these factors have made it more challenging for Netflix to add subscribers at the pace expected. Upon initiating a small position, we thought Netflix was in much earlier innings with regard to market penetration given its ~222 million subscriber base versus ~900 million broadband homes ex-China. However, management recently revealed, for the first time, that they have more than 100 million non-paying subscribers and that the more addressable segment of the market is roughly 450 million smart TV homes. While we think a large majority of broadband homes will ultimately become smart TV homes, management noted that smart TV home growth has stalled recently. In short, Netflix is much more penetrated into the immediately addressable market than we thought, and that’s leading to a variety of challenges. Management is now looking to develop strategies to monetize non-paying subscribers and create an ad-supported model, which they have railed against up to this point. Since Netflix reported 1Q22 results, we focused our research on trying to understand how and when the company plans to monetize non-paying subscribers and roll out an ad-supported streaming subscription. We’ve also done more work to understand the potential growth of the smart TV market going forward. While there are scenarios that could lead to acceptable growth and a decent investment return from the current valuation, we were not able to build the confidence to add to the position. At a roughly 1% weight of the Portfolio, we felt it was an up-or-out decision after the sharp price decline. Given our lack of conviction and an increasing number of more attractive opportunities within our global opportunity set, we decided to exit the position.""Story continuesOur calculations show that Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) ranks 19th on our list of the 30 Most Popular Stocks Among Hedge Funds. Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) was in 95 hedge fund portfolios at the end of the second quarter of 2022, compared to 109 funds in the previous quarter. Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) delivered a 26.81% return in the past 3 months.In October 2022, we also shared another hedge fund’s views on Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) in another article.

(NASDAQ:AMGN) sold US$4.9m worth of stock, possibly indicating weakness in the future",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/insiders-amgen-inc-nasdaq-amgn-110041748.html,1665313241,STORY,['AMGN'],"[The fact that multiple Amgen Inc. (NASDAQ:AMGN) insiders offloaded a considerable amount of shares over the past year could have raised some eyebrows amongst investors. When analyzing insider transactions, it is usually more valuable to know whether insiders are buying versus knowing if they are selling, as the latter sends an ambiguous message. However, if numerous insiders are selling, shareholders should investigate more.Although we don't think shareholders should simply follow insider transactions, we do think it is perfectly logical to keep tabs on what insiders are doing. View our latest analysis for Amgen The Last 12 Months Of Insider Transactions At AmgenThe Executive VP, Jonathan Graham, made the biggest insider sale in the last 12 months. That single transaction was for US$3.3m worth of shares at a price of US$242 each. So what is clear is that an insider saw fit to sell at around the current price of US$229. We generally don't like to see insider selling, but the lower the sale price, the more it concerns us. In this case, the big sale took place at around the current price, so it's not too bad (but it's still not a positive).Insiders in Amgen didn't buy any shares in the last year. The chart below shows insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last year. By clicking on the graph below, you can see the precise details of each insider transaction!insider-trading-volumeIf you are like me, then you will not want to miss this free list of growing companies that insiders are buying.Insiders At Amgen Have Sold Stock RecentlyOver the last three months, we've seen significant insider selling at Amgen. Specifically, Lead Independent Director Robert Eckert ditched US$1.6m worth of shares in that time, and we didn't record any purchases whatsoever. In light of this it's hard to argue that all the insiders think that the shares are a bargain.Insider OwnershipI like to look at how many shares insiders own in a company, to help inform my view of how aligned they are with insiders. Usually, the higher the insider ownership, the more likely it is that insiders will be incentivised to build the company for the long term. It's great to see that Amgen insiders own 0.2% of the company, worth about US$192m. This kind of significant ownership by insiders does generally increase the chance that the company is run in the interest of all shareholders.Story continuesWhat Might The Insider Transactions At Amgen Tell Us?An insider sold Amgen shares recently, but they didn't buy any. Looking to the last twelve months, our data doesn't show any insider buying. But since Amgen is profitable and growing, we're not too worried by this. While insiders do own a lot of shares in the company (which is good), our analysis of their transactions doesn't make us feel confident about the company. So these insider transactions can help us build a thesis about the stock, but it's also worthwhile knowing the risks facing this company. Every company has risks, and we've spotted 2 warning signs for Amgen you should know about.Of course Amgen may not be the best stock to buy. So you may wish to see this free collection of high quality companies.For the purposes of this article, insiders are those individuals who report their transactions to the relevant regulatory body.

Brent crude skyrocketed to around $130 before steadily declining – but that was likely due to the soaring prices for oil products, not oil itself, Rats said to CNBC on Friday.He noted that gas prices peaked at $180 a barrel and diesel prices peaked at $190 a barrel before the market began to see demand destruction – which suggests current prices have room to rise before hitting a critical point.""From that perspective, we are nowhere near prices that cause demand destruction. From that perspective, there is room to rally again,"" Rats said.He noted there are three factors facing the oil market that would likely drive prices higher.The first is OPEC's recent announcement of a production cut. The cartel on Wednesday they would slash oil production by two million barrels a day – a major blow to the global energy market, as OPEC+ supplies around 40% of the world's oil consumption.Second, the US Strategic Petroleum Reserve releases are winding down, with excess supply the US has brought to the market since April set to dry up this month.Finally, there are heightened odds of disruptions to Russia supplies. Russian oil exports have been falling ahead of the European Union ban on Russian oil, which are set to kick in by the end of the year. The nation has also threatened to slash oil production in response to a planned price cap on Russian oil by G7 nations. If the Kremlin goes through with a production cut, that will put more stress on the global oil supply, likely pushing prices higher.""All of that is coming together over the next couple of weeks, or month or two, and when those things come together I think that will put upward pressure on prices again,"" Rats said.Read the original article on Business Insider]"

The company's stock saw significant share price movement during recent months on the NASDAQGS, rising to highs of US$156 and falling to the lows of US$113. Some share price movements can give investors a better opportunity to enter into the stock, and potentially buy at a lower price. A question to answer is whether QUALCOMM's current trading price of US$121 reflective of the actual value of the large-cap? Or is it currently undervalued, providing us with the opportunity to buy? Let’s take a look at QUALCOMM’s outlook and value based on the most recent financial data to see if there are any catalysts for a price change. View our latest analysis for QUALCOMM Is QUALCOMM Still Cheap?The share price seems sensible at the moment according to my price multiple model, where I compare the company's price-to-earnings ratio to the industry average. In this instance, I’ve used the price-to-earnings (PE) ratio given that there is not enough information to reliably forecast the stock’s cash flows. I find that QUALCOMM’s ratio of 10.56x is trading slightly below its industry peers’ ratio of 15.04x, which means if you buy QUALCOMM today, you’d be paying a decent price for it. And if you believe that QUALCOMM should be trading at this level in the long run, then there’s not much of an upside to gain over and above other industry peers. Is there another opportunity to buy low in the future? Since QUALCOMM’s share price is quite volatile, we could potentially see it sink lower (or rise higher) in the future, giving us another chance to buy. This is based on its high beta, which is a good indicator for how much the stock moves relative to the rest of the market.What kind of growth will QUALCOMM generate?earnings-and-revenue-growthInvestors looking for growth in their portfolio may want to consider the prospects of a company before buying its shares. Although value investors would argue that it’s the intrinsic value relative to the price that matter the most, a more compelling investment thesis would be high growth potential at a cheap price. Though in the case of QUALCOMM, it is expected to deliver a relatively unexciting earnings growth of 1.3%, which doesn’t help build up its investment thesis. Growth doesn’t appear to be a main reason for a buy decision for the company, at least in the near term.Story continuesWhat This Means For YouAre you a shareholder? QCOM’s future growth appears to have been factored into the current share price, with shares trading around industry price multiples. However, there are also other important factors which we haven’t considered today, such as the financial strength of the company. Have these factors changed since the last time you looked at QCOM? Will you have enough confidence to invest in the company should the price drop below the industry PE ratio?Are you a potential investor? If you’ve been keeping tabs on QCOM, now may not be the most advantageous time to buy, given it is trading around industry price multiples. However, the positive growth outlook may mean it’s worth diving deeper into other factors in order to take advantage of the next price drop.In light of this, if you'd like to do more analysis on the company, it's vital to be informed of the risks involved.

Those bar unauthorized Chinese content in the jet.The acceptance of the aircraft is necessary for national security interests, LaPlante said in a statement, adding that the determination applies until the last aircraft under the contract is accepted, currently projected for October 2023.The pump supplier, Honeywell International Inc, will work to find an alternative source for the metal and use that in future lubricant pumps.The magnet does not transmit information or harm aircraft, and that there are no security risks involved.Lockheed Martin, which manufactures the jets, had said the issue was ""related to a magnet on the F-35 Turbomachine manufactured by Honeywell that includes cobalt and samarium alloy.""An alternative source for the alloy will be used in future, the Joint Program Office said in its statement.There are other Chinese-origin magnets on the jet that have received waivers from past Pentagon officials.

You can skip our detailed analysis of dividend stocks and their returns in the past, and go directly to read 5 Monthly Dividend Stocks with Over 4% Yield. Dividend stocks are outperforming this year as high-interest rates and inflation pull down the market. Dividend companies that make regular distributions to shareholders and have raised their payouts for years are valuable in times of financial instability. These companies tend to have stable cash flow generation and solid balance sheets to support shareholder returns. Some of the best dividend stocks in this context are The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO), Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ), and The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG).Over the years, dividend stocks have delivered long-term returns to shareholders during inflationary periods. According to a report published by BMO Capital Markets, dividend-paying stocks’ annual average return stood at 7.8% from 1998 to 2013, compared with a 2.4% annual average return of non-dividend stocks. During this period, the S&amp;P 500 returned 4.3%, significantly underperforming the dividend-paying securities. Another report by T. Rowe Price showed that dividend growers dominated during the down markets. From December 1985 to December 2020, dividend growers fell by 12.1% on average, compared to a 27.9% drop in non-dividend payers. The report further mentioned that with moderate returns of the broader markets, dividend companies offering yields between 2% to 3% are favorable investment options.Robert D. Arnott, the founder of Research Affiliates, talked about the significant representation of dividends in overall long-term market returns in his interview with Danske Invest. He mentioned that the average annual return from equities was 7.9% from 1802 to 2002, 5% of which was from dividends. The result shows that dividends were the main source of returns during this period. The report also mentioned that stocks with high dividend yields offer lower volatility and stronger downside protection during volatile times, compared with non-dividend paying stocks.Story continuesPhoto by Sharon McCutcheon on UnsplashOur Methodology: For this list, we selected monthly dividend stocks with yields over 4%.

Active investors aim to buy stocks that vastly outperform the market - but in the process, they risk under-performance. That downside risk was realized by Medtronic plc (NYSE:MDT) shareholders over the last year, as the share price declined 34%. That's well below the market decline of 21%. At least the damage isn't so bad if you look at the last three years, since the stock is down 23% in that time.Now let's have a look at the company's fundamentals, and see if the long term shareholder return has matched the performance of the underlying business. Check out our latest analysis for Medtronic To quote Buffett, 'Ships will sail around the world but the Flat Earth Society will flourish. There will continue to be wide discrepancies between price and value in the marketplace...' One flawed but reasonable way to assess how sentiment around a company has changed is to compare the earnings per share (EPS) with the share price.During the unfortunate twelve months during which the Medtronic share price fell, it actually saw its earnings per share (EPS) improve by 35%. It could be that the share price was previously over-hyped.The divergence between the EPS and the share price is quite notable, during the year. But we might find some different metrics explain the share price movements better.Revenue was pretty flat on last year, which isn't too bad. But the share price might be lower because the market expected a meaningful improvement, and got none.The image below shows how earnings and revenue have tracked over time (if you click on the image you can see greater detail).earnings-and-revenue-growthWe like that insiders have been buying shares in the last twelve months. Having said that, most people consider earnings and revenue growth trends to be a more meaningful guide to the business. If you are thinking of buying or selling Medtronic stock, you should check out this free report showing analyst profit forecasts.Story continuesA Different PerspectiveWhile the broader market lost about 21% in the twelve months, Medtronic shareholders did even worse, losing 32% (even including dividends). However, it could simply be that the share price has been impacted by broader market jitters. It might be worth keeping an eye on the fundamentals, in case there's a good opportunity. On the bright side, long term shareholders have made money, with a gain of 3% per year over half a decade. If the fundamental data continues to indicate long term sustainable growth, the current sell-off could be an opportunity worth considering.

Long-term tech stocks to buy abound, following some seriously negative sentiment and declining stock prices over the last month. The Federal Reserve heightened market fears when it raised interest rates by 75 basis points. Moreover, it cited the risk of inflation embedding itself into the economic system.Technology stocks fell by 10% in September as a result. Their growth prospects fall as central banks tighten monetary policy, which could create a recession, or at the very least much weaker demand and inflation. Investors who run a stock filter for companies with strong quality, growth, and value may find the stocks in the table below:Long-Term Tech Stocks to BuyBuy stocks with strong quality, value, and growth as denoted by scores in green.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsData from Stock RoverThe seven selected tech stocks are high quality. This is important, as the economy deteriorates in the months ahead. Expectations are that these companies will be able to sustain strong returns on their invested capital. More importantly, their profit margins will not fall as much. Companies in the semiconductor and computer hardware sector are used to managing through business cycles. Accordingly, during severe downturns, these companies often cut expenses to protect profits.Understandably, such companies may suffer from lower growth. In return, shareholders trade off this expected slowdown with better value. These companies’ value scores of 70/100 or higher suggest that investors have fewer downside risks in the long term.AKAMAkamai Technologies$86.02AMATApplied Materials$89.21AVGOBroadcom$483.93HPQHP Inc.$26.62MUMicron Technology$54.65STMSTMicroelectronics$34.96SWKSSkyworks Solutions$93.19Akamai Technologies (AKAM)building facade with akamai (AKAM) logo on it. representing tech stocksSource: Ken Wolter / Shutterstock.comAkamai Technologies (NASDAQ:AKAM) Chief Financial Officer Edward McGowan appears bullish on his long-term prospects. The Akamai CEO recently said the company will report steady EBITDA margins. While unfavorable exchange rates hurt results, slower web traffic benefits Akamai. This company faces less impact from peak traffic, allowing the firm to save on capital expenditures.Story continuesTo increase customer retention, Akamai passed its savings to customers in May 2022. For example, Akamai offered customers discounts. When business eventually rebounds, Akamai has the flexibility to increase hardware investments. Currently, capital expenditures account for only 2% of the company’s revenue.Customers require Akamai’s solutions to manage their cyber security needs. Additionally, with the company growing its Enterprise Application Access offering, customers get enterprise-grade access to security. EAA is a small part of the overall business. This creates an opportunity for long-term growth, especially after the firm acquired Guardicore in October 2021.Customers will keep investing in their digital supply chain despite the weaker economy. Additionally, these same customers will likely have new requirements for cybersecurity protection. Akamai offers them a safe user experience that will likely remain sticky over the long-term.Applied Materials (AMAT)Close-up Presentation of a New Generation Microchip. Gloved Hand Holding Piece of Technological Wonder. Semiconductor stocks are in the news.Source: ShutterstockApplied Materials (NASDAQ:AMAT) is a company with strong demand drivers that exceed supply concerns. That said, in this environment, AMAT stock is not reflecting this sentiment. Memory chip demand remains weak. Competition is heating up from Intel (NASDAQ:INTC), Samsung (OTCMKTS:SSNLF), and Taiwan Semiconductor (NYSE:TSM).The market appears to fearing this weak memory demand, which overshadows Applied’s strength. Currently, this company is growing in the industrial automation and automobile markets. What may be an economic slowdown on the horizon is unlikely to hurt these strong sectors of the market.In 2023, Applied is expected to enjoy relative strength in the foundry/logic markets. This will more than offset the weak memory chip market. In addition, the company will continue its investments in the 7-nanometer to the 3-nanometer manufacturing process. The company is progressing on increasing chip efficiencies as it overcomes various macro challenges.The world’s conversion from gas to electric vehicles also benefits Applied Materials. The EV market requires more critical semiconductors in its supply chain.Thus, as customers continue to invest in their digital infrastructure, I think Applied Materials is a great long-term tech stock to buy now.Broadcom (AVGO)broadcom (AVGO) logo outside office buildingSource: Sasima / Shutterstock.comAmong the reasons I like Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO) right now is the company’s limited exposure to the consumer market. The economic recession many expect may thus skirt past Broadcom, as investors focus on more commercially-exposed names in the tech infrastructure space.Broadcom is growing primarily from the strength in demand for the company’s infrastructure products. Broadcom benefits from a heavy backlog, which is unchanged at 50 weeks. On the supply side, Broadcom’s lack of exposure to China’s supply chain disruptions gives it an edge. CEO Hock Tan said that investors should expect the company to deliver growth of at least 5% annually for the long term. Even in a down cycle, growth that still averages 5% is notable.Broadcom has strong long-term prospects, particularly in the company’s graphics processing business. Via SmartNIC video transcode, and its ASIC market, the company is expected to reach critical mass within the next three years. Although the company’s emerging markets business is not guaranteed growth, it is worth the long-term speculation. AVGO stock has a history of performing well in new markets.HP Inc. (HPQ)HP sign with blue sky and autumn leaves as backdropSource: ShutterstockHP Inc. (NYSE:HPQ) spooked markets when it announced a decrease in demand for the company’s consumer products. Demand fell mainly due to the negative macroeconomic situation. Indeed, inflation and higher energy prices, plus the war in Europe, continue to provide a dampened outlook for PC demand moving forward.That said, in HP’s commercial market, the company benefited from a strong quarter. This strong performance was met with tempered expectations, as investors sent HPQ stock sharply lower. Shareholders appear to be bracing for more conservative corporate orders.Despite this stock’s price action, HP’s CEO, Enrique Lores, expects demand of 300 million units for the industry. More importantly, the addressable market for computers is bigger than before the pandemic.Between 2020 and 2021, the pandemic shifted the dynamics of the PC market. Telemedicine, gaming, remote schooling, and hybrid work are trends that may be more permanent than many think. thus, customers will likely continue to demand HP computers to increase their productivity. As a result, strong long-term prospects for HP PCs could be the catalyst that increases profits.HP’s average selling price is expected to rise by 20% to 30%. Even after factoring in supply chain constraints, better components and functionality will expand HP’s profit margins.Micron Technology (MU)Why MU Stock Looks Attractive for Longer Term InvestorsSource: madamF / Shutterstock.comMicron Technology (NASDAQ:MU) cut its utilization rates for the current quarter. The company now expects weaker NAND (storage) and DRAM (memory) demand will hurt margins. In addition, Micron must work through existing high inventories. By cutting production, Micron’s management team hopes this will position the company for the next technology transition.Markets priced in Micron’s elevated inventory problems. With revenue and shipment volumes expected to decline, investors are taking the company’s commentary at face value.That said, the company has also guided toward lower capital expenditures. Thus, there’s the potential that in the back half of the year, volumes will recover. Accordingly, cash flow could thus get a boost, and even turn positive, thanks to lower capital spending.Micron is expected to benefit from selling at better DRAM prices, after supply growth recovers. In 2023, demand for memory chips is expected improve. Additionally, the PC market is shifting from the less expensive DDR4 memory to the faster DDR5 format. Accordingly, I think Micron’s average selling price could stabilize and potentially rise.Investors are not paying much for MU stock. The price-to-earnings ratio is in the mid-single digits, around seven-times, at the time of writing.STMicroelectronics (STM)STMicroelectronics buildingSource: Michael Vi / Shutterstock.comSTMicroelectronics (NYSE:STM) managed relatively well through supply chain disruptions this past quarter. The company positioned its manufacturing to maximize output for high-definition-based products. CEO Jean-Marc Chery said that the company’s overall production of HD chips will increase by 12.5% in the third quarter.Despite weak economic conditions in Europe, STMicro entered a seasonally strong period in the third quarter. Its operating expenses of $810 million to $815 million speak to this. Investments in the fourth quarter are expected to lead to higher returns after that.Particular investments in the company’s Automotive and Discrete Group and Analog, MEMS, and Sensors Group are notable. That’s because these are strong markets with highly-engaged customers. Over time, expectations are that supply challenges in these segments will ease, benefiting investors in STM stock.Additionally, in the company’s personal electronics sector, STMicro will benefit from strong traction. The company is gearing up for a recovery that accelerates later this year and into its fourth quarter.Skyworks Solutions (SWKS)the Skyworks website is loading on a smartphoneSource: madamF / Shutterstock.comSkyworks Solutions (NASDAQ:SWKS) has many strong opportunities in its core business. The company is extending its technology growth in the industry. For example, on the mobile side, Skyworks is diversifying its business. This should lead to higher growth and stronger earnings for investors.In Skywork’s broad market portfolio, the company entered new end markets. CEO Liam Griffin said that the broad markets business is growing quickly. It accounts for 40% of the company’s overall business. This segment benefits from growth in data centers, handsets, infrastructure, and IoT markets.In July 2021, Skyworks completed its acquisition of the Infrastructure &amp; Automotive Business of Silicon Labs. This acquisition will allow the company to further benefit from scaling unique elements of its I&amp;A unit. Already, Skyworks is seeing benefits from customer growth following this deal. Over time, it’s expected that Skyworks will be able to scale this business unit to a greater degree than the overall sector. Accordingly, I expect stronger profitability on the horizon, which could lift SWKS stock materially above its 52-week low.On the date of publication, Chris Lau did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

And in December, a cyclical blitz of Jordan brand retro products is set to drop, which has led fans to brave cold weather and camp outside stores in years past.Story continues'Uncertain time period' in ChinaBeyond inventory calculus, sneaker brands have been navigating a faltering reopening in China, a key region contributing to sales growth.Nike sales in Greater China missed estimates in the latest quarter as COVID-19 lockdowns continued to weigh on the business.""In Q4, revenue declined 20% on a currency-neutral basis and EBIT declined 55% on a reported basis,"" Nike Chief Financial Officer Matt Friend said in the Q4 earnings call in June. ""This follows the region's most widespread COVID disruption since 2020, impacting over 100 cities and over 60% of our business.""Workers install a Nike logo lamp outside the Wukesong Arena in Beijing, China August 28, 2019. Picture taken August 28, 2019. REUTERS/Tingshu WangThe revenue decline could be 'a short- to medium-term COVID transitory issue,' Yih said, but it also could be early evidence of a consumer preference for domestic brands in China.Nike and other brands targeting expansion in China, such as Adidas (ADDYY), Under Armour (UA), and Lululemon (LULU), have faced greater competition from domestic brands such as Li-Ning and Anta, which have experienced revenue growth and increasing market share.""If you look at their first-half yearly numbers, Li-Ning was up 22%,"" Yih said. ""Anta was taking share of 14% in the market. You compare that to Adidas, down 35%, and then, for the first half of the year that we know of, from Nike, down 12%. And so we think that this is a very sort of uncertain time period.""Brad Smith is an anchor at Yahoo Finance.

If you want to see some more of the most valuable internet companies today versus 2000, go directly to 5 Most Valuable Internet Companies in 2000 vs. Today.The 10 most valuable internet companies have changed a lot since 22 years ago.Back in 2000, the internet was much smaller than what it is today. Globally, there were only around 413 million internet users.It was also much slower with many people using dialup.In 2000, most people also accessed the internet through either a PC or laptop. Popular apps like Facebook did not exist. The iPhone was not invented either. Cloud computing was mainly just a theory rather than reality.80% of people used Internet Explorer and Google Chrome did not exist.The 5 most popular sites back in 2000 included Yahoo.com, AOL.com, Geocities.com, MSN.com, and Lycos.com.Today, the internet is much larger with several billion more users.The internet is also much faster for many given 5G.Due to mobile phones, internet companies also do a lot more than just internet now. With the internet, people can work at home. They can do shopping, or they can watch TV or even movies.In terms of the 5 most popular sites, Yahoo.com and MSN.com still have a lot of users and the other sites have not done very well.The demographics of the people who use the internet have also changed. While many people in China weren't online in 2000, hundreds of millions of Chinese are online today. As a result of the demographic change, some of the world's most valuable internet companies are Chinese while none were Chinese in 2000.As a result of the huge growth of the internet as well as inflation, the 10 most valuable internet companies today are collectively worth a lot more than what they were collectively worth in 2000.The 10th most valuable company today is worth over $80 billion, for example, versus around $2.1 billion in 2000. Meanwhile the most valuable company today is worth almost $1.3 trillion versus $94.2 billion in 2000.Story continuesThe composition of the most valuable companies in 2000 versus today has also changed substantially. Aside from Amazon, every other company in the top 10 in 2000 isn't in the top 10 today. Some of the top internet companies back in 2000 did not do very well in terms of their stock performance also.The change illustrates how quickly the internet has evolved over time and how successful Amazon has really been in terms of growing its businesses.In terms of the future, it is very likely that the internet will continue to evolve with potentially several new top ten companies. Companies in India, which has a population that will be bigger than China soon, could also potentially make it into the top ten sometime in the future.The internet could also be more about virtual reality or augmented reality in the future. As a result, some companies that offer entirely new services that don't even exist today could also be in the top 10.If existing internet companies are well run, their values could continue to increase. Companies like Amazon.com that were in the top 10 in 2000 and 2022 could still potentially be in the top 10 in 2042 if it continues to grow quickly and innovate.Best Fintech Startups Investors are Flocking ToPhoto by Campaign Creators on UnsplashMethodologyFor the market caps of internet companies today, we took the top 20 internet companies from Statista as of June 2022 and we reranked them based on the market caps as of October 7.

The US government is providing incentives to increase the sales and market share of EVs to 50% of the automobile market by the end of this decade. These developments are taking place to reduce greenhouse emissions as the US, the EU, and other leading countries are focusing on becoming net-zero emitters of greenhouse gases by 2050.Leading automobile companies like General Motors Company (NYSE:GM), Ford Motor Company (NYSE:F), and Volkswagen AG (OTC:VWAGY) are also gearing up to boost sales of EVs.

Volkswagen is making an even bolder claim as it expects EVs to take up 70% and 55% of its total sales in Europe and the US, respectively, by the end of this decade.An Emerging MarketThe massive transition towards EVs is creating a new avenue for lithium-ion battery makers. Investors recognize this change in the automobile industry, but they do not have clarity on the breadth, complexity, and speed of the emerging lithium-ion battery industry globally. The focus of governments to lower greenhouse gas emissions is making corporations invest aggressively in renewable energy sources, providing an impetus to automobile and battery manufacturers. As a result, we are seeing some of the best EV stocks in the industry gaining market share.Adam Jonas, research head of Global Auto and Shared Mobility at Morgan Stanley, thinks that the impact of lithium-ion batteries can be revolutionary for the EV industry. The investment team at Morgan Stanley sees the battery industry as a key investment theme which is forecasted to have a total addressable market of $525 billion by 2040. The mass adoption of EVs has significantly lowered battery prices from $1,100 per kilowatt hour (kWh) in 2010 to just $110 kWh now.

Indeed, it isn’t surprising that energy stocks have performed well through 2022. Surging oil prices due to supply and demand dislocations have made these companies extremely profitable.That said, oil has started to correct from its highs on global growth concerns. I believe that this correction provides an opportunity to consider adding exposure to long-term energy stocks to buy.It’s worth noting that the U.S. Energy Information Administration believes that Brent oil is likely to average $90 in 2023. The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries also expects oil demand to touch pre-pandemic levels in 2023. Even with some economic concerns, the outlook for the energy sector seems positive.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsFactors such as geo-political tensions are also likely to ensure that oil remains firm over the next few years. Last year, Russell Hardy, CEO of commodity trader Vitol warned of an “oil supply ‘gap’ in 2025-2035 as upstream spending ebbs.” Therefore, even with investors’ focus increasingly on green energy, it’s too early to write-off fossil fuel investments.Let’s therefore talk about four long-term energy stocks to buy for sustained value creation.CVXChevron$159.23OXYOccidental Petroleum$67.89MROMarathon Oil$27.20RIGTransocean$3.00Chevron (CVX)CVX stockSource: tishomir / Shutterstock.comAfter touching 52-week highs of $182, Chevron (NYSE:CVX) stock dipped to as low as $135 per share. However, CVX stock has since bounced back from lows, and at current levels, seems attractive for long-term exposure.An obvious reason to buy CVX stock is this company’s attractive dividend yield of 4%. With an investment-grade balance sheet and strong cash flows, dividend growth seems likely.For Q2 2022, Chevron reported operating cash flow of $13.3 billion. This company’s annual cash flow potential is well over $30 billion (discounting the correction in oil prices). Thus, for those seeking companies valued attractively on a price-to-cash-flow basis, CVX stock is up there with the best.Story continuesAs of 2021, Chevron reported 11.3 billion barrels in proved oil-equivalent reserves. For the last year, the company also reported a robust reserve replacement ratio of 112%. With strong financial flexibility, Chevron is well-positioned to continue to make big investments in exploration. Reserve replacement is therefore likely to remain strong.With a healthy balance sheet, Chevron is also making big investments in renewable energy development. Over the next few years, this segment is likely to positively contribute to growth as well.Occidental PetroleumA magnifying glass zooms in on the Occidental Petroleum website.Source: Pavel Kapysh / Shutterstock.comWarren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRK.B) has continued to load up on shares of Occidental Petroleum (NYSE:OXY). Currently, the investment company holds a 20.9% stake in Occidental. Indeed, wherever the Oracle of Omaha invests is where many investors will start looking for real value.Buffett’s long-term investment in OXY stock is a potential indicator of the value the energy sector is likely to create in the coming years. Of course, there are many reasons why Warren Buffett may be bullish on OXY stock. Occidental has been generating robust cash flows, which are being used to strengthen the company’s credit profile. In Q2 2022 alone, the company retired $4.8 billion debt.With deleveraging, Occidental is positioned to increase shareholder returns as debt servicing costs decline and profits rise. Over the long-term, OXY stock certainly appears compelling as a top dividend growth stock to buy.From an asset perspective, Occidental is also one of the largest acreage holders in the United States. As of December 2021, the company reported 3.5 billion barrels of oil equivalent in proved reserves. A robust reserve base with an attractive break-even cost per barrel ensures stable cash flows in the years to come.Marathon OilMarathon Oil Logo at the top of a mobile device.Source: IgorGolovniov / Shutterstock.comMarathon Oil (NYSE:MRO) stock has surged by 78% in the last 12 months. That said, I still consider this stock to be among the top long-term energy stocks to buy.Marathon Oil has U.S.-focused assets with a strong presence in the Permian, Bakken and Eagle Ford regions, among others. As of December 2021, Marathon reported proved reserves of 1,106 million barrels of oil equivalent. On a year-on-year basis, proved reserves increased by 14%.It’s worth noting that Marathon had guided for free cash flow in excess of $3 billion at $80 WTI. The company however revised the FCF guidance to $4.5 billion in Q2 2022. This was assuming a scenario where WTI is priced at $100 and Henry hub at $6.With robust FCF visibility, Marathon is positioned to increase investments and dividend. On the downside, Marathon expects free cash flows to break even at $35 WTI.

RIG stock.Source: Postmodern Studio / ShutterstockMoving away from oil and gas exploration companies, Transocean (NYSE:RIG) is attractive among offshore rig providers. The stock has corrected by almost 38% in the last six-months. However, this correction seems overdone, as the company encounters a number of positive business catalysts.As an overview, Transocean has a fleet of 39 floaters with 100% focus on harsh environment and ultra-deep water ships. As of September 2022, Transocean reported an order backlog of $7.4 billion. This backlog provides clear cash flow visibility for the next two years.With oil above $80 per barrel, Transocean has been able to secure recent contracts at a higher day-rate. Thus, EBITDA margin expansion is likely in 2023 and beyond.It’s also worth noting that Transocean has a liquidity buffer of $1.9 billion. With visibility for positive cash flows, the company is positioned to deleverage.With a high-quality fleet, strong backlog and improving credit metrics, RIG stock is attractive after a deep correction.On the date of publication, Faisal Humayun did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

53,40bd81be-6cd6-3f79-9da5-6cd3ee3555e4,MAR,2022-10-09,3 Oil Stocks That Are Too Cheap to Ignore,InvestorPlace,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/3-oil-stocks-too-cheap-123856862.html,1664973536,STORY,"['^GSPC', 'MRO', 'CVX', 'VET']","[Oil stocks are doing great in the current market environment. With demand still strong and supply constrained, these companies have plenty of opportunity to make money hand over fist even if prices dip below $80 per barrel. Moreover, cheap oil stocks offer a great way to diversify your portfolio. I believe that even though they have seen some volatility in the market, the oil will continue as an essential part of our world and economy.This year’s narrative for cheap oil stocks is centered on the Russia/Ukraine conflict and the resulting energy crisis. Moreover, with Ukraine gaining momentum in the war, we may see an even more aggressive stance from the Kremlin. Therefore, oil stocks will likely be incredible bets for the foreseeable future.From an economic standpoint, oil prices, for the most part, tend to be price inelastic. Inelastic demand is when demand doesn’t fluctuate much, given a price change. Base demands for oil tend to be inelastic despite consumer sentiment. Having said that, let’s look at three cheap oil stocks that could provide plenty of value to your portfolio.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsCVXChevron$157.63MROMarathon Oil$26.50VETVermilion Energy$23.83Chevron (CVX)Chevron logo on blue sign in front of skyscraper buildingSource: Jeff Whyte / Shutterstock.comIntegrated oil and gas giant Chevron (NYSE:CVX) has been a great investment this year. Its shares have surged over 20% in a year where the S&amp;P 500 has tanked to historic lows. It’s been capitalizing on higher energy prices, enabling it to produce a robust free cash flow (or FCF). Consequently, it has more money to allocate to investors and has done a brilliant job of utilizing its cash to grow value for its stockholders. Though it’s held up well this year, it trades roughly 15% to 20% lower than its intrinsic value.Chevron remains arguably the best long-term investment in the sphere. As discussed by its CFO, Pierre Breber, its priority is to “invest and grow both traditional and new energy.” Accordingly, it’s investing 80% more in advancing its investments in the first half of this year compared to the prior-year period.Story continuesIn addition to its traditional business, it invests in its low-carbon segment. It is already one of the leading producers of renewable fuels with its $3 billion acquisition of Renewable Energy Group. These investments, however, haven’t impacted its robust dividend profile, which boasts a 3.60% yield with 34 consecutive years of dividend payout growth.Marathon Oil (MRO)Marathon Oil gas station carport on sunny day with blue sky backgroundSource: Jonathan Weiss/shutterstock.comMarathon Oil (NYSE:MRO) is a leading oil and gas exploration and production firm. It’s had an incredible 12 months on the back of stellar results from the energy sector. In the process, MRO has significantly increased its free cash flows and capital return policies, enabling it to become remarkably profitable despite scaling down over the past ten years.Marathon has been a cash-generating machine in the past couple of years. It earned a whopping FCF of over 1.3 billion in the second quarter. That number has jumped over 24%, with the renewed strength in the market. Hence, it expects to wrap up the year with a mind-boggling $4.5 billion in FCF.The most attractive element of MRO is its friendly and clear-cut shareholder rewards program. Its policies are primarily geared towards share repurchases over dividends, though, with it buying $760 million in shares in the second quarter. Nevertheless, it yields a relatively strong 1.4%. Despite its rock-solid results, its stock trades at just 1.9 forward sales, significantly lower than its 5-year average.Vermilion Energy (VET)Offshore oil rig near Harlingen, Nederlande. Oil producing is a major economic factor in the Netherlands.Source: travelview / Shutterstock.comVermilion Energy (NYSE:VET) is a Canadian oil and gas producer operating in North America, Europe, and Australia. Its stock has been bid up recently for its substantial exposure to European natural gas. Its acquisition of a larger stake in the Corrib gas project is set to pay off significantly next year.Vermilion had previously projected it would make $1.5 billion in FCF in 2023 and $1.2 billion in 2024 at current prices when oil prices were on the move. However, with the rising natural gas prices, it is poised to make significantly more, resulting in higher returns for its stockholders. Moreover, natural gas prices in the European region are expected to be over four times the price of oil next year and roughly three times the following year, which bodes remarkably well for VET stock over the long term. However, that upside hasn’t been priced in, which makes VET an incredible wager over the next couple of years.On the date of publication, Muslim Farooque did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

(NYSE:VZ) may be sending bullish signals at the moment, given that almost half of all companies in the United States have P/E ratios greater than 14x and even P/E's higher than 27x are not unusual. Although, it's not wise to just take the P/E at face value as there may be an explanation why it's limited.Verizon Communications could be doing better as it's been growing earnings less than most other companies lately. The P/E is probably low because investors think this lacklustre earnings performance isn't going to get any better. If this is the case, then existing shareholders will probably struggle to get excited about the future direction of the share price. View our latest analysis for Verizon Communications peKeen to find out how analysts think Verizon Communications' future stacks up against the industry? In that case, our free report is a great place to start.Is There Any Growth For Verizon Communications?Verizon Communications' P/E ratio would be typical for a company that's only expected to deliver limited growth, and importantly, perform worse than the market.Retrospectively, the last year delivered a decent 3.1% gain to the company's bottom line. The latest three year period has also seen a 29% overall rise in EPS, aided somewhat by its short-term performance. So we can start by confirming that the company has actually done a good job of growing earnings over that time.Shifting to the future, estimates from the analysts covering the company suggest earnings should grow by 2.7% each year over the next three years. That's shaping up to be materially lower than the 9.6% each year growth forecast for the broader market.With this information, we can see why Verizon Communications is trading at a P/E lower than the market. Apparently many shareholders weren't comfortable holding on while the company is potentially eyeing a less prosperous future.Story continuesWhat We Can Learn From Verizon Communications' P/E?We'd say the price-to-earnings ratio's power isn't primarily as a valuation instrument but rather to gauge current investor sentiment and future expectations.As we suspected, our examination of Verizon Communications' analyst forecasts revealed that its inferior earnings outlook is contributing to its low P/E. At this stage investors feel the potential for an improvement in earnings isn't great enough to justify a higher P/E ratio. It's hard to see the share price rising strongly in the near future under these circumstances.There are also other vital risk factors to consider before investing and we've discovered 2 warning signs for Verizon Communications that you should be aware of.You might be able to find a better investment than Verizon Communications.

Long-term tech stocks to buy abound, following some seriously negative sentiment and declining stock prices over the last month. The Federal Reserve heightened market fears when it raised interest rates by 75 basis points. Moreover, it cited the risk of inflation embedding itself into the economic system.Technology stocks fell by 10% in September as a result. Their growth prospects fall as central banks tighten monetary policy, which could create a recession, or at the very least much weaker demand and inflation. Investors who run a stock filter for companies with strong quality, growth, and value may find the stocks in the table below:Long-Term Tech Stocks to BuyBuy stocks with strong quality, value, and growth as denoted by scores in green.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsData from Stock RoverThe seven selected tech stocks are high quality. This is important, as the economy deteriorates in the months ahead. Expectations are that these companies will be able to sustain strong returns on their invested capital. More importantly, their profit margins will not fall as much. Companies in the semiconductor and computer hardware sector are used to managing through business cycles. Accordingly, during severe downturns, these companies often cut expenses to protect profits.Understandably, such companies may suffer from lower growth. In return, shareholders trade off this expected slowdown with better value. These companies’ value scores of 70/100 or higher suggest that investors have fewer downside risks in the long term.AKAMAkamai Technologies$86.02AMATApplied Materials$89.21AVGOBroadcom$483.93HPQHP Inc.$26.62MUMicron Technology$54.65STMSTMicroelectronics$34.96SWKSSkyworks Solutions$93.19Akamai Technologies (AKAM)building facade with akamai (AKAM) logo on it. representing tech stocksSource: Ken Wolter / Shutterstock.comAkamai Technologies (NASDAQ:AKAM) Chief Financial Officer Edward McGowan appears bullish on his long-term prospects. The Akamai CEO recently said the company will report steady EBITDA margins. While unfavorable exchange rates hurt results, slower web traffic benefits Akamai. This company faces less impact from peak traffic, allowing the firm to save on capital expenditures.Story continuesTo increase customer retention, Akamai passed its savings to customers in May 2022. For example, Akamai offered customers discounts. When business eventually rebounds, Akamai has the flexibility to increase hardware investments. Currently, capital expenditures account for only 2% of the company’s revenue.Customers require Akamai’s solutions to manage their cyber security needs. Additionally, with the company growing its Enterprise Application Access offering, customers get enterprise-grade access to security. EAA is a small part of the overall business. This creates an opportunity for long-term growth, especially after the firm acquired Guardicore in October 2021.Customers will keep investing in their digital supply chain despite the weaker economy. Additionally, these same customers will likely have new requirements for cybersecurity protection. Akamai offers them a safe user experience that will likely remain sticky over the long-term.Applied Materials (AMAT)Close-up Presentation of a New Generation Microchip. Gloved Hand Holding Piece of Technological Wonder. Semiconductor stocks are in the news.Source: ShutterstockApplied Materials (NASDAQ:AMAT) is a company with strong demand drivers that exceed supply concerns. That said, in this environment, AMAT stock is not reflecting this sentiment. Memory chip demand remains weak. Competition is heating up from Intel (NASDAQ:INTC), Samsung (OTCMKTS:SSNLF), and Taiwan Semiconductor (NYSE:TSM).The market appears to fearing this weak memory demand, which overshadows Applied’s strength. Currently, this company is growing in the industrial automation and automobile markets. What may be an economic slowdown on the horizon is unlikely to hurt these strong sectors of the market.In 2023, Applied is expected to enjoy relative strength in the foundry/logic markets. This will more than offset the weak memory chip market. In addition, the company will continue its investments in the 7-nanometer to the 3-nanometer manufacturing process. The company is progressing on increasing chip efficiencies as it overcomes various macro challenges.The world’s conversion from gas to electric vehicles also benefits Applied Materials. The EV market requires more critical semiconductors in its supply chain.Thus, as customers continue to invest in their digital infrastructure, I think Applied Materials is a great long-term tech stock to buy now.Broadcom (AVGO)broadcom (AVGO) logo outside office buildingSource: Sasima / Shutterstock.comAmong the reasons I like Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO) right now is the company’s limited exposure to the consumer market. The economic recession many expect may thus skirt past Broadcom, as investors focus on more commercially-exposed names in the tech infrastructure space.Broadcom is growing primarily from the strength in demand for the company’s infrastructure products. Broadcom benefits from a heavy backlog, which is unchanged at 50 weeks. On the supply side, Broadcom’s lack of exposure to China’s supply chain disruptions gives it an edge. CEO Hock Tan said that investors should expect the company to deliver growth of at least 5% annually for the long term. Even in a down cycle, growth that still averages 5% is notable.Broadcom has strong long-term prospects, particularly in the company’s graphics processing business. Via SmartNIC video transcode, and its ASIC market, the company is expected to reach critical mass within the next three years. Although the company’s emerging markets business is not guaranteed growth, it is worth the long-term speculation. AVGO stock has a history of performing well in new markets.HP Inc. (HPQ)HP sign with blue sky and autumn leaves as backdropSource: ShutterstockHP Inc. (NYSE:HPQ) spooked markets when it announced a decrease in demand for the company’s consumer products. Demand fell mainly due to the negative macroeconomic situation. Indeed, inflation and higher energy prices, plus the war in Europe, continue to provide a dampened outlook for PC demand moving forward.That said, in HP’s commercial market, the company benefited from a strong quarter. This strong performance was met with tempered expectations, as investors sent HPQ stock sharply lower. Shareholders appear to be bracing for more conservative corporate orders.Despite this stock’s price action, HP’s CEO, Enrique Lores, expects demand of 300 million units for the industry. More importantly, the addressable market for computers is bigger than before the pandemic.Between 2020 and 2021, the pandemic shifted the dynamics of the PC market. Telemedicine, gaming, remote schooling, and hybrid work are trends that may be more permanent than many think. thus, customers will likely continue to demand HP computers to increase their productivity. As a result, strong long-term prospects for HP PCs could be the catalyst that increases profits.HP’s average selling price is expected to rise by 20% to 30%. Even after factoring in supply chain constraints, better components and functionality will expand HP’s profit margins.Micron Technology (MU)Why MU Stock Looks Attractive for Longer Term InvestorsSource: madamF / Shutterstock.comMicron Technology (NASDAQ:MU) cut its utilization rates for the current quarter. The company now expects weaker NAND (storage) and DRAM (memory) demand will hurt margins. In addition, Micron must work through existing high inventories. By cutting production, Micron’s management team hopes this will position the company for the next technology transition.Markets priced in Micron’s elevated inventory problems. With revenue and shipment volumes expected to decline, investors are taking the company’s commentary at face value.That said, the company has also guided toward lower capital expenditures. Thus, there’s the potential that in the back half of the year, volumes will recover. Accordingly, cash flow could thus get a boost, and even turn positive, thanks to lower capital spending.Micron is expected to benefit from selling at better DRAM prices, after supply growth recovers. In 2023, demand for memory chips is expected improve. Additionally, the PC market is shifting from the less expensive DDR4 memory to the faster DDR5 format. Accordingly, I think Micron’s average selling price could stabilize and potentially rise.Investors are not paying much for MU stock. The price-to-earnings ratio is in the mid-single digits, around seven-times, at the time of writing.STMicroelectronics (STM)STMicroelectronics buildingSource: Michael Vi / Shutterstock.comSTMicroelectronics (NYSE:STM) managed relatively well through supply chain disruptions this past quarter. The company positioned its manufacturing to maximize output for high-definition-based products. CEO Jean-Marc Chery said that the company’s overall production of HD chips will increase by 12.5% in the third quarter.Despite weak economic conditions in Europe, STMicro entered a seasonally strong period in the third quarter. Its operating expenses of $810 million to $815 million speak to this. Investments in the fourth quarter are expected to lead to higher returns after that.Particular investments in the company’s Automotive and Discrete Group and Analog, MEMS, and Sensors Group are notable. That’s because these are strong markets with highly-engaged customers. Over time, expectations are that supply challenges in these segments will ease, benefiting investors in STM stock.Additionally, in the company’s personal electronics sector, STMicro will benefit from strong traction. The company is gearing up for a recovery that accelerates later this year and into its fourth quarter.Skyworks Solutions (SWKS)the Skyworks website is loading on a smartphoneSource: madamF / Shutterstock.comSkyworks Solutions (NASDAQ:SWKS) has many strong opportunities in its core business. The company is extending its technology growth in the industry. For example, on the mobile side, Skyworks is diversifying its business. This should lead to higher growth and stronger earnings for investors.In Skywork’s broad market portfolio, the company entered new end markets. CEO Liam Griffin said that the broad markets business is growing quickly. It accounts for 40% of the company’s overall business. This segment benefits from growth in data centers, handsets, infrastructure, and IoT markets.In July 2021, Skyworks completed its acquisition of the Infrastructure &amp; Automotive Business of Silicon Labs. This acquisition will allow the company to further benefit from scaling unique elements of its I&amp;A unit. Already, Skyworks is seeing benefits from customer growth following this deal. Over time, it’s expected that Skyworks will be able to scale this business unit to a greater degree than the overall sector. Accordingly, I expect stronger profitability on the horizon, which could lift SWKS stock materially above its 52-week low.On the date of publication, Chris Lau did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

Although management delivered an encouraging framework during the company’s investor day, observers noted a contrast between present-day realities and the forward vision. Initially popping up on Tuesday’s late-morning session, HAS stock struggled since then.According to Barron’s, Hasbro unveiled a strategic initiative that may lead to significantly higher revenue and profit margins by 2027. Specifically, the company aims to generate a single-digit compound annual growth rate (CAGR) to hit over $8.5 billion in revenue by 2027. Last year, the toymaker rang up $6.4 billion on the top line.Structurally, to achieve this goal, Hasbro will bolster existing brands and exit unprofitable ones. Ultimately, the company seeks to have three billion-dollar brands by 2027. Currently, it owns one.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsDuring the aforementioned period, management projects an operating profit margin of over 20%. This contrasts with the 2022 projection of 16%. Per Barron’s, “Hasbro plans to cut costs by between $250 million and $300 million over three years, including $150 million by the end of 2023.”“A rightsized portfolio will improve efficiencies and reduce cost in product development, manufacturing, and overhead,” said Hasbro CEO Eric Nyman.Nevertheless, CFO Deborah Thomas acknowledged that while fourth-quarter results should reflect the benefits of the strategic initiative, the upcoming Q3 report will present challenges. Further, Thomas announced a cut to Hasbro’s full-year outlook. Management now models 2022 revenue to be flat or slightly down in constant-currency terms.HAS Stock Must Contend With RealityWhile HAS stock ultimately gained 1.4% on Tuesday’s session, it’s down more than 2% in the early afternoon hours. Investors appear to have trouble digesting the nearer-term pessimism — based on worrying indicators such as macroeconomic headwinds — against longer-term optimism.Story continuesPer Yahoo Finance’s coverage of Hasbro’s investor day, some observers deemed the company’s growth targets as too aggressive. As well, they raised eyebrows at how management intends to achieve broader profitability metrics. In particular, the projected 50% increase in operating profits over the next three years attracted skepticism.JPMorgan Chase analyst Megan Alexander summed up Hasbro’s announcement as a “show-me story in the near-term with 4Q an even higher-bar considering three quarters of misses vs. the Street in its high-margin Wizards of the Coast segment while trends in its consumer products business appear to be deteriorating into a weaker consumer backdrop.”Moreover, the current profile for HAS stock presents an unsettling picture for prospective investors. Free cash flow pings lower than desired. As well, the company features high debt to the tune of $3.5 billion more than cash on hand.On the date of publication, Josh Enomoto did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.A former senior business analyst for Sony Electronics, Josh Enomoto has helped broker major contracts with Fortune Global 500 companies.

The only thing Wall Street likes more than good earnings these days are the promise of more good earnings down the road.But my entry for the best stocks of 2022 has disappointed in a major way. Despite blowout earnings and positive news, shares of the cannabis financial firm have slumped 65% this year. The over-the-counter firm now trade at 1.75x sales, pricing POSaBIT at a third of other point-of-sale companies like Fidelity National Information Services (NYSE:FIS) and a tenth of payment firms like Visa (NYSE:V). (Fortunately, my No. 2 pick would get bought at a 100% premium).Among my list of 10 stocks that could rise 10x (safely), POSaBIT is now the cheapest on an industry-relative basis.A Promising Stock in a Terrible MarketPOSaBIT’s shares have fallen on a combination of investor de-risking and cannabis market issues.Consider the first element: investor de-risking.Unexpected inflation and rising rates have punished shares this year in a way few predicted. Today, 361 companies on America’s three main exchanges trade for negative enterprise value, meaning that the firm’s cash is worth more than its market value. These factors will ease as the U.S. Federal Reserve slows the pace of rate rises.Story continuesThe second factor – cannabis issues – is more worrying.“The cannabis industry is in a full-on downturn,” Jeremy Berke of Business Insider wrote in an update this month. “Legal cannabis sales have slowed down in states like California and Colorado as consumers feel the pinch of inflation.”The illicit marijuana market has also hurt the legal industry, which pays taxes to local and state governments. A study by California’s United Cannabis Business Association found that almost 90% of licensed dispensaries in 2017 had closed by 2022.Though POSaBIT will eventually come out ahead, these short-term headwinds have scared investors about the company’s near-term growth.Should You Buy POSaBIT Stock?None of this will comfort investors in POSaBIT, a stock that’s underperformed the Nasdaq index by almost 30% this year. When shares are down by twice the index, it’s easy to worry about holding the bag.But POSaBIT’s underlying business continues to power along. On Sept. 20, the firm entered the Illinois market.“Launching our system in Illinois was a major goal for us this year and we are proud to have achieved it,” Mr. Hamlin said. “We are riding a wave of increased momentum and the results speak for themselves.”The point-of-sale company also continues to grow revenues faster than costs. In Q2, selling and general expenses (SG&amp;A) decreased despite a 28% sequential increase in gross profits. At that rate, the firm could reach profitability by 2024. As I mentioned in my initial write-up of the company:“POSaBIT operates … a lucrative business with few traditional competitors … Marijuana remains a Schedule 1 substance under federal laws, preventing most publicly traded companies from breaking in.”Ignoring the valuation noise, I expect the company could be worth $5 by 2024… a modest price that still values POSaBIT under $300 million. It could be worth as much as $10 within several years if it succeeds.Best Stocks: The Bottom Line on POSAFStill, any investor should continue to exercise caution.“We all know that penny stock investing is risky at best,” I also warned in my original piece. “That means investing in my top penny stock pick for 2022 should still be done with a measure of restraint. Even though POSaBIT now holds a 5x return potential, investors should only tip-toe back into the stock with cash they can stand to lose.”With shares down to 50 cents, the same is true as ever. POSaBIT remains a top pick, but tread lightly in the wild world of over-the-counter penny stocks, no matter how cheap they become.On Penny Stocks and Low-Volume Stocks: With only the rarest exceptions, InvestorPlace does not publish commentary about companies that have a market cap of less than $100 million or trade less than 100,000 shares each day.

These range from the highest market value of Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) at $2.5 trillion to the lowest — Liberty Latin America Class C (NASDAQ:LILAK) — with a value of around $1.5 billion.If you’re familiar with Warren Buffett’s investing style, you know that the Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRK.B) CEO loves to collect dividends from these companies.The other thing that Buffett really likes is share repurchases. That’s because the company’s share count is reduced, giving shareholders a larger piece of the company without investing any additional funds. InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsSo, it only makes sense when looking for long-term Warren Buffett stocks to buy that you consider companies on the Berkshire Hathaway list that grow their dividends and repurchase shares in a big way.For the purposes of this article, I’ll be selecting seven companies from at least five different sectors who have repurchased at least $500 million of their stock in the latest fiscal year and $300 million in dividends.After all, if these stocks are good enough for Warren Buffett, they ought to be good enough for you. AAPLApple$146.40MCOMoody’s$261.97AXPAmerican Express$144.36HPQHP Inc.$26.81ALLYAlly Financial$30.69KRKroger$44.59AONAon$282.98Apple (AAPL)Apple (AAPL) logo brand and text sign on entrance facade store American multinational boutique corporation dealership shopSource: sylv1rob1 / Shutterstock.comAny list of top long-term Warren Buffett stocks to buy ought to start with Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL). In the latest fiscal year ended Sept. 25, 2021, Apple bought back $86 billion of its stock and paid out $14.5 billion in dividends. From fiscal 2012 through Q3 2022, Apple bought back $529.1 billion of its stock. Over the same period, it paid out $128.2 billion in dividends.Apple currently accounts for 41.1% of the Berkshire Hathaway equity portfolio. Berkshire’s stake in Apple is 5.7%, making this iPhone producer by far the holding company’s largest position. Apple ended the third quarter with net cash of $60 billion.Story continuesDown almost 20% year-to-date through Oct. 4, AAPL stock is trading at 6.1-times sales, its lowest multiple since 2019.BofA Global Research analyst Wamsi Mohan recently suggested that the next year could get ugly for Apple if consumers pull back on their discretionary spending. The analyst feels that the spending slowdown isn’t just with low-end consumers, but has spread to a wider group of people. While that’s a reason to be cautious about your stock purchases, Apple remains a stock to own for the long haul. You shouldn’t be attempting to time the market with this kind of quality stock. If you have money to invest, buy it.Moody’s (MCO)A Moody's Corporation (MCO) sign in silver.Source: Daniel J. Macy / Shutterstock.comIn the latest fiscal year ended Dec. 31, 2021, Moody’s (NYSE:MCO) bought back $750 million of its stock and paid out $463 million in dividends. Moody’s, best known for its credit ratings business, authorized an additional $750 million in share repurchases in February. That’s on top of the $1 billion approved in February 2021. As of June 30, it had $960 million remaining on the authorization. There is no expiration. In February 2019, the company entered into an accelerated stock repurchase program. In total, Moody’s repurchased 2.8 million shares at an average price of $180.33. That’s a 45% return over 43 months. A monthly return of 1% isn’t too shabby. As for dividends, the company has more than doubled its annual payment per share between 2015 ($1.36) and 2022 ($2.80), a compound annual growth rate of 10.9%.Moody’s currently accounts for 2.0% of the Berkshire Hathaway equity portfolio. Berkshire’s stake in the company is 13.4%. It is the holding company’s 8th-largest position. The 21 analysts covering MCO stock give it an overweight rating with an average target price of $307.44, 14% higher than its current share price.  American Express (AXP)the American Express logo etched into woodSource: First Class Photography / Shutterstock.comIn the latest fiscal year ended Dec. 31, 2021, American Express (NYSE:AXP) bought back $7.7 billion of its stock and paid out $1.4 billion in dividends. The company’s board authorized the repurchase of up to 120 million shares of its stock in September 2019. It does not have an expiration date. Over the past three years, American Express has repurchased 93 million sharesforf $13.1 billion. That’s anaveragee price paid of $140.86 a share. That’s only slightly less than where its stock is currently trading.Amex currently accounts for 6.8% of the Berkshire Hathaway equity portfolio. Berkshire’s stake in the company is 20.2%. It is the holding company’s fifth-largest position. In the second quarter ended June 30, American Express announced its revenues increased 31% to $13.4 billion while its net income fell 8% to $2.57 a share. Due to the success of its premium card products, it added 3.2 million new proprietary cards in the quarter. The company’s management team appears to be more than happy with its quarterly results. As a result, American Express raised its yearly revenue growth guidance from 19% at the midpoint of its range to 24%. On the bottom line, the company maintained its full-year EPS guidance of $9.45. HP (HPQ)Source: Tomasz Wozniak / Shutterstock.comIn the latest fiscal year ended Dec. 31, 2021, HP (NYSE:HPQ) bought back $6.3 billion of its stock and paid out $938 million in dividends. The company’s board authorized the repurchase of an additional $15 billion of its stock in February 2020. It does not have an expiration. There is $6.4 billion remaining on the authorization. In 2021, it repurchased 224 million shares at an average price of $28.13, slightly more than where it’s currently trading.

It is the holding company’s 12th-largest position. Due to share repurchases, HP’s non-GAAP EPS in Q3 2022 rose 4% year-over-year to $1.04, despite its non-GAAP net income falling by 10% in the quarter to $1.1 billion from $1.2 billion a year earlier.The 18 analysts covering HPQ stock have an average target price of $30.25, 14% higher than its current share price.  Ally Financial (ALLY)ally financial office building stocks to buySource: JHVEPhoto/Shutterstock.comIn the latest fiscal year ended Dec. 31, 2021, Ally Financial (NYSE:ALLY) bought back $2.0 billion of its stock and paid out $324 million in dividends. In January, The company announced that the board authorized a $2.0 billion share repurchase program effective until the end of the year. In addition, it raised its quarterly cash dividend to 30 cents a share, a 20% increase over the previous quarter. Through the first six months of 2022, Ally repurchased $1.18 billion of its stock at an average price of $42.93 a share, considerably higher than its current share price. It can do better. Hopefully, it was buying in the third quarter.  Ally accounts for 0.3% of the Berkshire Hathaway equity portfolio. Berkshire’s stake in the company is 9.7%. It is the holding company’s 29th-largest position, but certainly finds itself in many investors’ list of top long-term Warren Buffett stocks to buy. One of the reasons Buffett may continue to own Ally’s stock is its deflated tangible book value per share. At the end of Q2 2022, it was $32.16, down from $38.83 a year earlier, and trading at a discount to its share price. Kroger (KR)A Kroger (KR) logo on a building.Source: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.comIn the latest fiscal year ended Jan. 31, 2022, Kroger (NYSE:KR) bought back $1.7 billion of its stock and paid out $589 million in dividends. At the time the company announced its Q2 2022 results in September, the grocery store operator reported that the board authorized a new $1.0 billion share repurchase program. In June, Kroger increased its quarterly dividend by 24% to 26 cents or $1.04 annually. It was the 16th consecutive year increasing its dividend since it was reinstated in 2006. Through the first six months of 2022, Kroger repurchased $975 million of its stock at an average price of $51.32. That’s 3% higher than the average of its high ($62.78) and low ($42.70) for 2022. That’s a decent, if not spectacular, job of buying back its stock.Kroger accounts for 0.7% of the Berkshire Hathaway equity portfolio. Berkshire’s stake in the company is 7.3%. It is the holding company’s 17th-largest position. In early September, Kroger boosted its annual profit forecast on higher prepared food and private label revenues from increased in-home dining. As a result, the company now expects to earn as much as $4.05 a share, up 10 cents from $3.95. Aon (AON)A photo pf physical representations of cryptocoins above wooden tiles bearing black letters that spell out insurance.Source: Najmi Arif/ShutterStock.comRounding out the list of top long-term Warren Buffett stocks to buy, we have Aon (NYSE:AON). Aon repurchased $3.5 billion of its stock and paid out $447 million in dividends in 2021.  The global leader in commercial risk, health, reinsurance, and wealth solutions, paid an average of $286.82 for each of the 12.4 million shares it repurchased last year. Thanks to 2022’s major correction, it’s a little underwater on those purchases. The company’s board authorized its first share repurchase program in April 2012 for $5 billion. It subsequently added $22.5 billion in buybacks on four occasions since, the most recent, a $7.5 billion bump in February. As of June 30, it had $7.9 billion remaining on its program.Since 2012, the company has repurchased 154.1 million shares of its stock at an average price of $127.19, a return on investment of 124%, or 8% compounded annually. A reasonable, if not lights-out, return on its investment.   In August, Aon moved its Chief Operating Officer, James Platt, into the new role of Chief Digital Officer. Platt oversees the company’s Digital Client Solutions. Replacing Platt as COO is Mindy Simon. She comes over from Conagra Brands, where she was the firm’s Chief Information Officer. Aon continues to build a strong bench of talent. That will be good for shareholder returns down the road. The company accounts for 0.4% of the Berkshire Hathaway equity portfolio. Berkshire’s stake in the company is 2.1%. It is the holding company’s 25th-largest position. On the date of publication, Will Ashworth did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

As inflationary forces diminished the dollar’s purchasing power in the first half of this year, many sought to arrest this trajectory through passive income. And while the Federal Reserve intends to effectively introduce deflationary forces by raising the benchmark interest rate, the underlying chaos still makes dividend payers look good.Another reason to consider cheap dividend stocks is that they offer stability at a discount. While it’s unfair to make blanket statements, companies pay dividends from their profits. Naturally, this circumstance implies earnings generation, meaning they’re not purely growth driven. Therefore, businesses with solid track records should be able to weather storms better than non-passive-income providers.Finally, many may question the word “cheap” in cheap dividend stocks. For that, I will rely on valuation metrics and implied value against forward-looking industry or business-specific fundamentals.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsIt’s not an exact science, but I’m going to throw some quantifiable reasoning here. And with that, here are seven cheap dividend stocks to consider.JNJJohnson &amp; Johnson$165.11SAPSAP$87.18TXNTexas Instruments$167.80FASTFastenal$48.13RHIRobert Half$79.66TROWT. Rowe Price$111.54UPSUnited Parcel Service$167.93Johnson &amp; Johnson (JNJ)Why Johnson &amp; Johnson Stock is Clearly Set to Rise AgainSource: ShutterstockJohnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) is a global household name representing a pharmaceutical giant featuring several over-the-counter products. Undergirding an investment profile that caters to everyday necessities, JNJ is a smart buy, no matter the circumstances. However, with the present chaos in the market, it makes for one of the best cheap dividend stocks to buy.For one thing, you can look at the company’s year-to-date performance in the equity price charts. JNJ is down about 3.7%, which arguably belies its all-around pertinence. More importantly, the underlying firm provides a decent forward yield of 2.74%. Perhaps not the most remarkable figure, it does exceed the median yield of 1.58% for the healthcare segment.Story continuesAccording to Gurufocus.com, JNJ is fairly valued. Fair enough. However, Johnson &amp; Johnson features financial strengths across the board. The company enjoys balance sheet stability, solid growth metrics, and excellent profitability indicators. Since stability commands a fundamental premium during these tumultuous times, JNJ ranks among the cheap dividend stocks to buy.SAP (SAP)SAP sign is seen at SAP SuccessFactors Global Headquarters in South San Francisco, CaliforniaSource: Tada Images / Shutterstock.comA German multinational software company, SAP (NYSE:SAP), represents a stalwart of stability in the global business ecosystem. It plays a critical role in the efficient flow of supply chains. Ironically, the coronavirus pandemic disrupted such business networks, leading to sharp corporate losses. In turn, the red ink filtered down SAP’s ability to generate income.Investors can see the damage for themselves. Since the start of the year, SAP stock has slipped nearly 38%. Still, for the contrarian, the crimson ink may represent an opportunity. As well, per the subject of this article on cheap dividend stocks to buy, SAP offers passive income. Specifically, it provides a forward yield of 2.38%. In contrast, the technology sector’s average yield sits at 1.37%.Gurufocus.com labels SAP stock as modestly undervalued. As with JNJ, SAP enjoys solid financials across the board, including solid growth metrics and a stable balance sheet. Perhaps most notably, SAP features a forward price-earnings ratio of 14.3x. The software industry’s median forward PE stands at 22x.Texas Instruments (TXN)Texas Instruments logo on its world headquarters located in Dallas, Texas.Source: Katherine Welles / Shutterstock.comA technology firm, Texas Instruments (NASDAQ:TXN), specializes in designing and manufacturing semiconductors. As well the company focuses on the development of integrated circuits. Of course, because of the severe disruption of the Covid-19 pandemic, few eagerly touch semiconductor investments like TXN stock. That might be a mistake in the long run.To be fair, TXN initially presents an uninviting profile, shedding over 13% YTD. Over the trailing year, it’s down a bit more at a loss of nearly 15%. Still, these represent far superior numbers than the underlying benchmark tech index. In addition, TXN separates itself from other tech plays by offering passive income. It features a forward yield of 3%, above the average industry yield of 1.4%.Notably, Gurufocus.com labels TXN as modestly undervalued. Per the resource’s proprietary valuation metrics, it views Texas Instruments as an excellent all-around investment. Most significantly, the company enjoys a net margin of nearly 44%, above approximately 98% of other tech firms. Therefore, TXN ranks easily among the best cheap dividend stocks to buy.Fastenal (FAST)Fastenal (FAST) logo displayed on a mobile phoneSource: IgorGolovniov / Shutterstock.comFocused on industrial supplies, Fastenal (NASDAQ:FAST) represents the largest fastener distributor in North America, per its website. Still, this impressive status also points to significant risks. Should the Fed’s hawkish monetary policy inadvertently slip the U.S. economy into recession, Fastenal brings an uncertain outlook. I’m not saying this to be negative on FAST stock. It’s just a risk factor to acknowledge.Another danger to FAST stems from broader market volatility. Since the start of the year through the Oct. 4 session, Fastenal dropped 22% in equity value. However, contrarians might consider this an opportunity for an eventual economic comeback. To be fair, FAST doesn’t represent one of the most generous cheap dividend stocks. Still, its forward yield of 2.58% beats the industry average of 2.36%.Moving onto Gurufocus.com, it labels Fastenal’s business as modestly undervalued. Per the investment resource, the company commands excellent growth and profitability metrics. As well, its books are stable. For instance, Fastenal’s equity-to-asset ratio stands at 0.69, beating nearly 85% of sector peers.Robert Half (RHI)The Robert Half International logo on the website homepageSource: Casimiro PT / Shutterstock.comAn employment services agency, Robert Half (NYSE:RHI), connects professional talent with hiring enterprises. It then acts as a middleman entity, collecting fees for its services. While many may criticize Robert Half for “fleecing the flock,” the reality is that not all companies have the resources to hire qualified talent. Therefore, they outsource the (often cumbersome) process to firms like Robert Half.Still, with Covid-19 imposing strange dynamics in the employer-employee relationship, RHI stock suffered from relevancy loss. Therefore, RHI slipped 27% YTD. Anecdotally, I’m almost sure that these strange dynamics will correct themselves. At the end of the day, employers sign the checks. Employees must either put up or shut up. This statement is harsh, but it’s also a reality.Let’s look to Gurufocus.com for some numbers. RHI rates as modestly undervalued. Arguably, the company’s highlight financial metric is its return-on-equity of nearly 50%, blasting the industry median of 8.6%. RHI also features a forward yield of 2.16%, which isn’t great. However, the combo of likely surging relevance (from desperate workers amid a possible recession) bolsters the case for RHI as one of the cheap dividend stocks to buy.T. Rowe Price (TROW)T row price (TROW) logo magnified through a lens while displayed on a web browserSource: Pavel Kapysh / Shutterstock.comAn investment management firm, T. Rowe Price (NASDAQ:TROW), may immediately appear to be one of the cheap dividend stocks. However, critics may argue that it’s for the wrong reasons. As an investment management firm, T. Rowe performed well through 2021. The reason? Inflation, baby! With the greenback’s purchasing power guaranteed (under the dovish monetary ecosystem) to decline, investors have an active incentive to invest. Otherwise, the dollar’s value goes into the toilet.Under a deflationary system – that is, rising purchasing power – the incentive flips on its head. Essentially, if investors do nothing and sit on cash, they enjoy a guaranteed positive return of relative wealth. Thus, any investment opportunity must be so compelling that people will give up guaranteed returns. On a related note, that’s the reason why, arguably, most folks hate deflationary cycles.Not surprisingly, then, Gurufocus.com considers TROW significantly undervalued. Still, contrarian investors may appreciate the opportunity as the underlying company features its industry’s top-level growth and profitability metrics. In addition, T. Rowe features a forward yield of 4.24%.United Parcel Service (UPS)Envelopes with UPS logo on them. UPS stock.Source: monticello / ShutterstockIf you thought buying the above idea for cheap dividend stocks was extremely risky, look at United Parcel Service (NYSE:UPS). I don’t want to spend too much time beating a dead horse. However, the consumer economy suffered badly this year. As a result, a rival courier service disclosed terrible pre-earnings figures that sent shockwaves throughout the market in September.Understandably, UPS finds itself in the crosshairs. Nevertheless, its performance isn’t too awful, losing about 21% YTD in the price charts. Fundamentally, the hesitation is understandable given that the ratio of e-commerce sales relative to total retail sales has diminished conspicuously since the Covid peak. Nevertheless, the ratio did pick up in the second quarter of this year.For the extreme contrarian seeking cheap dividend stocks, Gurufocus.com labels UPS modestly undervalued. Despite incoming challenges, the company currently stands strong regarding growth and profitability metrics. The deflated equity value and the forward yield of 3.6% might make shares worthwhile for gamblers.On the date of publication, Josh Enomoto did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.A former senior business analyst for Sony Electronics, Josh Enomoto has helped broker major contracts with Fortune Global 500 companies.

Rowe Price$111.54UPSUnited Parcel Service$167.93Johnson &amp; Johnson (JNJ)Why Johnson &amp; Johnson Stock is Clearly Set to Rise AgainSource: ShutterstockJohnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) is a global household name representing a pharmaceutical giant featuring several over-the-counter products. Undergirding an investment profile that caters to everyday necessities, JNJ is a smart buy, no matter the circumstances. However, with the present chaos in the market, it makes for one of the best cheap dividend stocks to buy.For one thing, you can look at the company’s year-to-date performance in the equity price charts. JNJ is down about 3.7%, which arguably belies its all-around pertinence. More importantly, the underlying firm provides a decent forward yield of 2.74%. Perhaps not the most remarkable figure, it does exceed the median yield of 1.58% for the healthcare segment.Story continuesAccording to Gurufocus.com, JNJ is fairly valued. Fair enough. However, Johnson &amp; Johnson features financial strengths across the board. The company enjoys balance sheet stability, solid growth metrics, and excellent profitability indicators. Since stability commands a fundamental premium during these tumultuous times, JNJ ranks among the cheap dividend stocks to buy.SAP (SAP)SAP sign is seen at SAP SuccessFactors Global Headquarters in South San Francisco, CaliforniaSource: Tada Images / Shutterstock.comA German multinational software company, SAP (NYSE:SAP), represents a stalwart of stability in the global business ecosystem. It plays a critical role in the efficient flow of supply chains. Ironically, the coronavirus pandemic disrupted such business networks, leading to sharp corporate losses. In turn, the red ink filtered down SAP’s ability to generate income.Investors can see the damage for themselves. Since the start of the year, SAP stock has slipped nearly 38%. Still, for the contrarian, the crimson ink may represent an opportunity. As well, per the subject of this article on cheap dividend stocks to buy, SAP offers passive income. Specifically, it provides a forward yield of 2.38%. In contrast, the technology sector’s average yield sits at 1.37%.Gurufocus.com labels SAP stock as modestly undervalued. As with JNJ, SAP enjoys solid financials across the board, including solid growth metrics and a stable balance sheet. Perhaps most notably, SAP features a forward price-earnings ratio of 14.3x. The software industry’s median forward PE stands at 22x.Texas Instruments (TXN)Texas Instruments logo on its world headquarters located in Dallas, Texas.Source: Katherine Welles / Shutterstock.comA technology firm, Texas Instruments (NASDAQ:TXN), specializes in designing and manufacturing semiconductors. As well the company focuses on the development of integrated circuits. Of course, because of the severe disruption of the Covid-19 pandemic, few eagerly touch semiconductor investments like TXN stock. That might be a mistake in the long run.To be fair, TXN initially presents an uninviting profile, shedding over 13% YTD. Over the trailing year, it’s down a bit more at a loss of nearly 15%. Still, these represent far superior numbers than the underlying benchmark tech index. In addition, TXN separates itself from other tech plays by offering passive income. It features a forward yield of 3%, above the average industry yield of 1.4%.Notably, Gurufocus.com labels TXN as modestly undervalued. Per the resource’s proprietary valuation metrics, it views Texas Instruments as an excellent all-around investment. Most significantly, the company enjoys a net margin of nearly 44%, above approximately 98% of other tech firms. Therefore, TXN ranks easily among the best cheap dividend stocks to buy.Fastenal (FAST)Fastenal (FAST) logo displayed on a mobile phoneSource: IgorGolovniov / Shutterstock.comFocused on industrial supplies, Fastenal (NASDAQ:FAST) represents the largest fastener distributor in North America, per its website. Still, this impressive status also points to significant risks. Should the Fed’s hawkish monetary policy inadvertently slip the U.S. economy into recession, Fastenal brings an uncertain outlook. I’m not saying this to be negative on FAST stock. It’s just a risk factor to acknowledge.Another danger to FAST stems from broader market volatility. Since the start of the year through the Oct. 4 session, Fastenal dropped 22% in equity value. However, contrarians might consider this an opportunity for an eventual economic comeback. To be fair, FAST doesn’t represent one of the most generous cheap dividend stocks. Still, its forward yield of 2.58% beats the industry average of 2.36%.Moving onto Gurufocus.com, it labels Fastenal’s business as modestly undervalued. Per the investment resource, the company commands excellent growth and profitability metrics. As well, its books are stable. For instance, Fastenal’s equity-to-asset ratio stands at 0.69, beating nearly 85% of sector peers.Robert Half (RHI)The Robert Half International logo on the website homepageSource: Casimiro PT / Shutterstock.comAn employment services agency, Robert Half (NYSE:RHI), connects professional talent with hiring enterprises. It then acts as a middleman entity, collecting fees for its services. While many may criticize Robert Half for “fleecing the flock,” the reality is that not all companies have the resources to hire qualified talent. Therefore, they outsource the (often cumbersome) process to firms like Robert Half.Still, with Covid-19 imposing strange dynamics in the employer-employee relationship, RHI stock suffered from relevancy loss. Therefore, RHI slipped 27% YTD. Anecdotally, I’m almost sure that these strange dynamics will correct themselves. At the end of the day, employers sign the checks. Employees must either put up or shut up. This statement is harsh, but it’s also a reality.Let’s look to Gurufocus.com for some numbers. RHI rates as modestly undervalued. Arguably, the company’s highlight financial metric is its return-on-equity of nearly 50%, blasting the industry median of 8.6%. RHI also features a forward yield of 2.16%, which isn’t great. However, the combo of likely surging relevance (from desperate workers amid a possible recession) bolsters the case for RHI as one of the cheap dividend stocks to buy.T. Rowe Price (TROW)T row price (TROW) logo magnified through a lens while displayed on a web browserSource: Pavel Kapysh / Shutterstock.comAn investment management firm, T. Rowe Price (NASDAQ:TROW), may immediately appear to be one of the cheap dividend stocks. However, critics may argue that it’s for the wrong reasons. As an investment management firm, T. Rowe performed well through 2021. The reason? Inflation, baby! With the greenback’s purchasing power guaranteed (under the dovish monetary ecosystem) to decline, investors have an active incentive to invest. Otherwise, the dollar’s value goes into the toilet.Under a deflationary system – that is, rising purchasing power – the incentive flips on its head. Essentially, if investors do nothing and sit on cash, they enjoy a guaranteed positive return of relative wealth. Thus, any investment opportunity must be so compelling that people will give up guaranteed returns. On a related note, that’s the reason why, arguably, most folks hate deflationary cycles.Not surprisingly, then, Gurufocus.com considers TROW significantly undervalued. Still, contrarian investors may appreciate the opportunity as the underlying company features its industry’s top-level growth and profitability metrics. In addition, T. Rowe features a forward yield of 4.24%.United Parcel Service (UPS)Envelopes with UPS logo on them. UPS stock.Source: monticello / ShutterstockIf you thought buying the above idea for cheap dividend stocks was extremely risky, look at United Parcel Service (NYSE:UPS). I don’t want to spend too much time beating a dead horse. However, the consumer economy suffered badly this year. As a result, a rival courier service disclosed terrible pre-earnings figures that sent shockwaves throughout the market in September.Understandably, UPS finds itself in the crosshairs. Nevertheless, its performance isn’t too awful, losing about 21% YTD in the price charts. Fundamentally, the hesitation is understandable given that the ratio of e-commerce sales relative to total retail sales has diminished conspicuously since the Covid peak. Nevertheless, the ratio did pick up in the second quarter of this year.For the extreme contrarian seeking cheap dividend stocks, Gurufocus.com labels UPS modestly undervalued. Despite incoming challenges, the company currently stands strong regarding growth and profitability metrics. The deflated equity value and the forward yield of 3.6% might make shares worthwhile for gamblers.On the date of publication, Josh Enomoto did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.A former senior business analyst for Sony Electronics, Josh Enomoto has helped broker major contracts with Fortune Global 500 companies.

These range from the highest market value of Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) at $2.5 trillion to the lowest — Liberty Latin America Class C (NASDAQ:LILAK) — with a value of around $1.5 billion.If you’re familiar with Warren Buffett’s investing style, you know that the Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRK.B) CEO loves to collect dividends from these companies.The other thing that Buffett really likes is share repurchases. That’s because the company’s share count is reduced, giving shareholders a larger piece of the company without investing any additional funds. InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsSo, it only makes sense when looking for long-term Warren Buffett stocks to buy that you consider companies on the Berkshire Hathaway list that grow their dividends and repurchase shares in a big way.For the purposes of this article, I’ll be selecting seven companies from at least five different sectors who have repurchased at least $500 million of their stock in the latest fiscal year and $300 million in dividends.After all, if these stocks are good enough for Warren Buffett, they ought to be good enough for you. AAPLApple$146.40MCOMoody’s$261.97AXPAmerican Express$144.36HPQHP Inc.$26.81ALLYAlly Financial$30.69KRKroger$44.59AONAon$282.98Apple (AAPL)Apple (AAPL) logo brand and text sign on entrance facade store American multinational boutique corporation dealership shopSource: sylv1rob1 / Shutterstock.comAny list of top long-term Warren Buffett stocks to buy ought to start with Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL). In the latest fiscal year ended Sept. 25, 2021, Apple bought back $86 billion of its stock and paid out $14.5 billion in dividends. From fiscal 2012 through Q3 2022, Apple bought back $529.1 billion of its stock. Over the same period, it paid out $128.2 billion in dividends.Apple currently accounts for 41.1% of the Berkshire Hathaway equity portfolio. Berkshire’s stake in Apple is 5.7%, making this iPhone producer by far the holding company’s largest position. Apple ended the third quarter with net cash of $60 billion.Story continuesDown almost 20% year-to-date through Oct. 4, AAPL stock is trading at 6.1-times sales, its lowest multiple since 2019.BofA Global Research analyst Wamsi Mohan recently suggested that the next year could get ugly for Apple if consumers pull back on their discretionary spending. The analyst feels that the spending slowdown isn’t just with low-end consumers, but has spread to a wider group of people. While that’s a reason to be cautious about your stock purchases, Apple remains a stock to own for the long haul. You shouldn’t be attempting to time the market with this kind of quality stock. If you have money to invest, buy it.Moody’s (MCO)A Moody's Corporation (MCO) sign in silver.Source: Daniel J. Macy / Shutterstock.comIn the latest fiscal year ended Dec. 31, 2021, Moody’s (NYSE:MCO) bought back $750 million of its stock and paid out $463 million in dividends. Moody’s, best known for its credit ratings business, authorized an additional $750 million in share repurchases in February. That’s on top of the $1 billion approved in February 2021. As of June 30, it had $960 million remaining on the authorization. There is no expiration. In February 2019, the company entered into an accelerated stock repurchase program. In total, Moody’s repurchased 2.8 million shares at an average price of $180.33. That’s a 45% return over 43 months. A monthly return of 1% isn’t too shabby. As for dividends, the company has more than doubled its annual payment per share between 2015 ($1.36) and 2022 ($2.80), a compound annual growth rate of 10.9%.Moody’s currently accounts for 2.0% of the Berkshire Hathaway equity portfolio. Berkshire’s stake in the company is 13.4%. It is the holding company’s 8th-largest position. The 21 analysts covering MCO stock give it an overweight rating with an average target price of $307.44, 14% higher than its current share price.  American Express (AXP)the American Express logo etched into woodSource: First Class Photography / Shutterstock.comIn the latest fiscal year ended Dec. 31, 2021, American Express (NYSE:AXP) bought back $7.7 billion of its stock and paid out $1.4 billion in dividends. The company’s board authorized the repurchase of up to 120 million shares of its stock in September 2019. It does not have an expiration date. Over the past three years, American Express has repurchased 93 million sharesforf $13.1 billion. That’s anaveragee price paid of $140.86 a share. That’s only slightly less than where its stock is currently trading.Amex currently accounts for 6.8% of the Berkshire Hathaway equity portfolio. Berkshire’s stake in the company is 20.2%. It is the holding company’s fifth-largest position. In the second quarter ended June 30, American Express announced its revenues increased 31% to $13.4 billion while its net income fell 8% to $2.57 a share. Due to the success of its premium card products, it added 3.2 million new proprietary cards in the quarter. The company’s management team appears to be more than happy with its quarterly results. As a result, American Express raised its yearly revenue growth guidance from 19% at the midpoint of its range to 24%. On the bottom line, the company maintained its full-year EPS guidance of $9.45. HP (HPQ)Source: Tomasz Wozniak / Shutterstock.comIn the latest fiscal year ended Dec. 31, 2021, HP (NYSE:HPQ) bought back $6.3 billion of its stock and paid out $938 million in dividends. The company’s board authorized the repurchase of an additional $15 billion of its stock in February 2020. It does not have an expiration. There is $6.4 billion remaining on the authorization. In 2021, it repurchased 224 million shares at an average price of $28.13, slightly more than where it’s currently trading.

It is the holding company’s 12th-largest position. Due to share repurchases, HP’s non-GAAP EPS in Q3 2022 rose 4% year-over-year to $1.04, despite its non-GAAP net income falling by 10% in the quarter to $1.1 billion from $1.2 billion a year earlier.The 18 analysts covering HPQ stock have an average target price of $30.25, 14% higher than its current share price.  Ally Financial (ALLY)ally financial office building stocks to buySource: JHVEPhoto/Shutterstock.comIn the latest fiscal year ended Dec. 31, 2021, Ally Financial (NYSE:ALLY) bought back $2.0 billion of its stock and paid out $324 million in dividends. In January, The company announced that the board authorized a $2.0 billion share repurchase program effective until the end of the year. In addition, it raised its quarterly cash dividend to 30 cents a share, a 20% increase over the previous quarter. Through the first six months of 2022, Ally repurchased $1.18 billion of its stock at an average price of $42.93 a share, considerably higher than its current share price. It can do better. Hopefully, it was buying in the third quarter.  Ally accounts for 0.3% of the Berkshire Hathaway equity portfolio. Berkshire’s stake in the company is 9.7%. It is the holding company’s 29th-largest position, but certainly finds itself in many investors’ list of top long-term Warren Buffett stocks to buy. One of the reasons Buffett may continue to own Ally’s stock is its deflated tangible book value per share. At the end of Q2 2022, it was $32.16, down from $38.83 a year earlier, and trading at a discount to its share price. Kroger (KR)A Kroger (KR) logo on a building.Source: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.comIn the latest fiscal year ended Jan. 31, 2022, Kroger (NYSE:KR) bought back $1.7 billion of its stock and paid out $589 million in dividends. At the time the company announced its Q2 2022 results in September, the grocery store operator reported that the board authorized a new $1.0 billion share repurchase program. In June, Kroger increased its quarterly dividend by 24% to 26 cents or $1.04 annually. It was the 16th consecutive year increasing its dividend since it was reinstated in 2006. Through the first six months of 2022, Kroger repurchased $975 million of its stock at an average price of $51.32. That’s 3% higher than the average of its high ($62.78) and low ($42.70) for 2022. That’s a decent, if not spectacular, job of buying back its stock.Kroger accounts for 0.7% of the Berkshire Hathaway equity portfolio. Berkshire’s stake in the company is 7.3%. It is the holding company’s 17th-largest position. In early September, Kroger boosted its annual profit forecast on higher prepared food and private label revenues from increased in-home dining. As a result, the company now expects to earn as much as $4.05 a share, up 10 cents from $3.95. Aon (AON)A photo pf physical representations of cryptocoins above wooden tiles bearing black letters that spell out insurance.Source: Najmi Arif/ShutterStock.comRounding out the list of top long-term Warren Buffett stocks to buy, we have Aon (NYSE:AON). Aon repurchased $3.5 billion of its stock and paid out $447 million in dividends in 2021.  The global leader in commercial risk, health, reinsurance, and wealth solutions, paid an average of $286.82 for each of the 12.4 million shares it repurchased last year. Thanks to 2022’s major correction, it’s a little underwater on those purchases. The company’s board authorized its first share repurchase program in April 2012 for $5 billion. It subsequently added $22.5 billion in buybacks on four occasions since, the most recent, a $7.5 billion bump in February. As of June 30, it had $7.9 billion remaining on its program.Since 2012, the company has repurchased 154.1 million shares of its stock at an average price of $127.19, a return on investment of 124%, or 8% compounded annually. A reasonable, if not lights-out, return on its investment.   In August, Aon moved its Chief Operating Officer, James Platt, into the new role of Chief Digital Officer. Platt oversees the company’s Digital Client Solutions. Replacing Platt as COO is Mindy Simon. She comes over from Conagra Brands, where she was the firm’s Chief Information Officer. Aon continues to build a strong bench of talent. That will be good for shareholder returns down the road. The company accounts for 0.4% of the Berkshire Hathaway equity portfolio. Berkshire’s stake in the company is 2.1%. It is the holding company’s 25th-largest position. On the date of publication, Will Ashworth did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

In a perfect world, we'd like to see a company investing more capital into its business and ideally the returns earned from that capital are also increasing. Basically this means that a company has profitable initiatives that it can continue to reinvest in, which is a trait of a compounding machine. Speaking of which, we noticed some great changes in Mondelez International's (NASDAQ:MDLZ) returns on capital, so let's have a look.What Is Return On Capital Employed (ROCE)?If you haven't worked with ROCE before, it measures the 'return' (pre-tax profit) a company generates from capital employed in its business. To calculate this metric for Mondelez International, this is the formula:Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)0.094 = US$4.9b ÷ (US$66b - US$14b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to June 2022).Thus, Mondelez International has an ROCE of 9.4%.  In absolute terms, that's a low return but it's around the Food industry average of 9.6%. View our latest analysis for Mondelez International roceIn the above chart we have measured Mondelez International's prior ROCE against its prior performance, but the future is arguably more important. If you'd like to see what analysts are forecasting going forward, you should check out our free report for Mondelez International.What The Trend Of ROCE Can Tell UsMondelez International has not disappointed with their ROCE growth. Looking at the data, we can see that even though capital employed in the business has remained relatively flat, the ROCE generated has risen by 27% over the last five years. So it's likely that the business is now reaping the full benefits of its past investments, since the capital employed hasn't changed considerably. The company is doing well in that sense, and it's worth investigating what the management team has planned for long term growth prospects.Story continuesWhat We Can Learn From Mondelez International's ROCETo bring it all together, Mondelez International has done well to increase the returns it's generating from its capital employed. And with a respectable 48% awarded to those who held the stock over the last five years, you could argue that these developments are starting to get the attention they deserve. With that being said, we still think the promising fundamentals mean the company deserves some further due diligence.On a separate note, we've found   2 warning signs for Mondelez International   you'll probably want to know about.While Mondelez International isn't earning the highest return, check out this free list of companies that are earning high returns on equity with solid balance sheets.Have feedback on this article?

70,3102775b-0c3d-3ef4-8c4d-252246079691,COF,2022-10-09,Gold vs. Silver: Is Either a Good Investment During Inflation?,SmartAsset,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/gold-vs-silver-investments-better-185522952.html,1665234002,STORY,"['C=F', 'LB=F', 'SI=F', 'GC=F', 'KC=F']","[gold vs silver investmentCommodities trading means you’re buying and selling raw materials rather than finished products (like a house) or financial assets (like stocks and bonds). Commodities are assets like corn, coffee, lumber and ore. One common form of commodities trading is investing in precious metals, namely gold and silver. As an investment asset, gold and silver have very different properties and uses in your portfolio.For more help with investing in gold or silver, consider getting the help of a financial advisor.Gold vs. Silver: UtilityThe biggest thing that differentiates precious metal investing from other commodity investing is utility. For most other commodities, investors judge value based on supply and consumer demand. If you want to invest in coffee beans, for example, you can judge prices by how much coffee people are currently drinking, how tastes are changing, etc.Precious metals are different in that they have relatively low commercial utility. Compared with other metals, here are relatively few consumer or industrial uses for assets like gold and silver.However, silver does have much more industrial and commercial use than gold. Approximately half of all silver bought and sold on the market is used commercially, with applications ranging from dentistry to electronics. (This is still quite small compared to other metals, which are almost entirely used for production.) By contrast, gold has very few commercial applications aside from jewelry. This gives investors a basis on which to judge and predict price movements for silver, since you can make decisions based on factors such as industry need and how the global economy is moving.Gold vs. Silver: Cost and Volatilitygold vs silver investmentAt time of writing, silver traded at approximately $25.77 per ounce. Gold traded at $1,960 per ounce. While the details vary, the gap is consistent. Gold is historically much more expensive than silver. This is in part because silver deposits are nearly 20 times as common as gold. This leads to two outcomes for investors.Story continuesFirst, it’s much easier to invest in silver than gold. You can buy more of it for less money, meaning that less liquid investors can get into silver more easily. As with all financial assets this can also expose you to greater potential gains and losses, since you’re likely to see more change relative to the scope of your investment with a portfolio of silver.However, that’s also the textbook definition of volatility. Low-cost assets tend to also be highly volatile specifically because small price changes have outsized effects on the underlying investment. For example, at current prices, silver only needs to change price by $2.57 per ounce to have a 10% price fluctuation. If the price of gold changed by $2.57, it would represent a change of 0.0013%.Volatility isn’t necessarily a bad thing but it is something to watch out for, especially if you’re seeking a long-term investment.Gold vs. Silver: Relationship to Broader MarketThe price of gold tends to move inversely to the stock market.Gold is what’s known as a “countercyclical investment.” This means that it tends to go up when mainstream assets go down and vice versa. Historically, the worse the stock market does the more investors flock to gold. By contrast, when times are good, investors tend to pull their money out of gold and put it into assets with greater links to the overall economy.As a result, many investors hold gold in their portfolio specifically for if they need liquidity during a downturn. For example, a recession is the worst time to sell stocks but the best time to buy them. Having a pre-existing investment in gold can give you a valuable asset to sell during a recession so that you can buy other people’s undervalued assets without selling your own.By contrast, silver tends to move with the economy overall, at least more so than gold. This is in significant part because of the same commercial applications that make silver a more predictable asset. When the economy slows down, industries need less silver for manufacturing, driving the price down.Gold vs. Silver: Which Should You Buy?gold vs silver investmentThere’s no such thing as an objectively “better” investment.  It all depends on your market position and the state of your portfolio. A good rule of thumb is this: Buy silver if you’re investing for when times are good. This is a semi-predictable speculation asset that can make you some real money. Buy gold if you’re investing for when times are bad.A good S&amp;P 500 index fund will do you better than gold in the long run, but this can be a good countercyclical asset if you want to ensure liquidity in the event of a recession.The Bottom LineGold and silver are especially popular commodity investments, in large part because of their historic relationship with money. Governments once used gold and silver to make their currency. While no major economy uses gold or silver as the basis for its currency any longer, investors still see these two metals as active stores of value. Silver is more volatile, cheaper and more tightly linked with the industrial economy. Gold is more expensive and better for diversifying your portfolio overall. Either or both may have a place in your portfolio.Precious Metal Investing TipsArguably the best use for gold as an investment is to mitigate portfolio risk. This is a good asset for market downturns, since it can give you a source of value at a time when other investments are cratering.A financial advisor can help you decide if gold or silver would be a good part of your portfolio. Finding a qualified financial advisor doesn’t have to be hard.

Our analysis will employ the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model. Don't get put off by the jargon, the math behind it is actually quite straightforward.We would caution that there are many ways of valuing a company and, like the DCF, each technique has advantages and disadvantages in certain scenarios. For those who are keen learners of equity analysis, the Simply Wall St analysis model here may be something of interest to you. See our latest analysis for Coca-Cola What's The Estimated Valuation?We use what is known as a 2-stage model, which simply means we have two different periods of growth rates for the company's cash flows. Generally the first stage is higher growth, and the second stage is a lower growth phase. To start off with, we need to estimate the next ten years of cash flows. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.A DCF is all about the idea that a dollar in the future is less valuable than a dollar today, so we need to discount the sum of these future cash flows to arrive at a present value estimate:10-year free cash flow (FCF) forecast2023202420252026202720282029203020312032 Levered FCF ($, Millions) US$10.4bUS$10.9bUS$10.8bUS$13.1bUS$13.8bUS$14.4bUS$15.0bUS$15.4bUS$15.9bUS$16.3bGrowth Rate Estimate SourceAnalyst x9Analyst x6Analyst x2Analyst x1Est @ 5.45%Est @ 4.4%Est @ 3.66%Est @ 3.14%Est @ 2.78%Est @ 2.53% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 5.3% US$9.9kUS$9.9kUS$9.2kUS$10.7kUS$10.7kUS$10.6kUS$10.4kUS$10.2kUS$9.9kUS$9.7k(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$101bStory continuesWe now need to calculate the Terminal Value, which accounts for all the future cash flows after this ten year period. The Gordon Growth formula is used to calculate Terminal Value at a future annual growth rate equal to the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield of 1.9%. We discount the terminal cash flows to today's value at a cost of equity of 5.3%.Terminal Value (TV)= FCF2032 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$16b× (1 + 1.9%) ÷ (5.3%– 1.9%) = US$489bPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$489b÷ ( 1 + 5.3%)10= US$291bThe total value, or equity value, is then the sum of the present value of the future cash flows, which in this case is US$392b. The last step is to then divide the equity value by the number of shares outstanding. Compared to the current share price of US$54.5, the company appears quite undervalued at a 40% discount to where the stock price trades currently. The assumptions in any calculation have a big impact on the valuation, so it is better to view this as a rough estimate, not precise down to the last cent.dcfImportant AssumptionsThe calculation above is very dependent on two assumptions. The first is the discount rate and the other is the cash flows. If you don't agree with these result, have a go at the calculation yourself and play with the assumptions. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Coca-Cola as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 5.3%, which is based on a levered beta of 0.800. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.Looking Ahead:Although the valuation of a company is important, it is only one of many factors that you need to assess for a company. DCF models are not the be-all and end-all of investment valuation. Rather it should be seen as a guide to ""what assumptions need to be true for this stock to be under/overvalued?"" For instance, if the terminal value growth rate is adjusted slightly, it can dramatically alter the overall result. Can we work out why the company is trading at a discount to intrinsic value? For Coca-Cola, we've put together three fundamental factors you should further research:Risks: Every company has them, and we've spotted   2 warning signs for Coca-Cola   you should know about.Future Earnings: How does KO's growth rate compare to its peers and the wider market?

You can skip our detailed analysis of dividend stocks and their returns in the past, and go directly to read 5 Monthly Dividend Stocks with Over 4% Yield. Dividend stocks are outperforming this year as high-interest rates and inflation pull down the market. Dividend companies that make regular distributions to shareholders and have raised their payouts for years are valuable in times of financial instability. These companies tend to have stable cash flow generation and solid balance sheets to support shareholder returns. Some of the best dividend stocks in this context are The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO), Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ), and The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG).Over the years, dividend stocks have delivered long-term returns to shareholders during inflationary periods. According to a report published by BMO Capital Markets, dividend-paying stocks’ annual average return stood at 7.8% from 1998 to 2013, compared with a 2.4% annual average return of non-dividend stocks. During this period, the S&amp;P 500 returned 4.3%, significantly underperforming the dividend-paying securities. Another report by T. Rowe Price showed that dividend growers dominated during the down markets. From December 1985 to December 2020, dividend growers fell by 12.1% on average, compared to a 27.9% drop in non-dividend payers. The report further mentioned that with moderate returns of the broader markets, dividend companies offering yields between 2% to 3% are favorable investment options.Robert D. Arnott, the founder of Research Affiliates, talked about the significant representation of dividends in overall long-term market returns in his interview with Danske Invest. He mentioned that the average annual return from equities was 7.9% from 1802 to 2002, 5% of which was from dividends. The result shows that dividends were the main source of returns during this period. The report also mentioned that stocks with high dividend yields offer lower volatility and stronger downside protection during volatile times, compared with non-dividend paying stocks.Story continuesPhoto by Sharon McCutcheon on UnsplashOur Methodology: For this list, we selected monthly dividend stocks with yields over 4%.

(NASDAQ:INTU), then you'll have to look at the makeup of its share registry. And the group that holds the biggest piece of the pie are institutions with 85% ownership. In other words, the group stands to gain the most (or lose the most) from their investment into the company.Since institutional have access to huge amounts of capital, their market moves tend to receive a lot of scrutiny by retail or individual investors. Therefore, a good portion of institutional money invested in the company is usually a huge vote of confidence on its future.Let's delve deeper into each type of owner of Intuit, beginning with the chart below. View our latest analysis for Intuit ownership-breakdownWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Intuit?Many institutions measure their performance against an index that approximates the local market. So they usually pay more attention to companies that are included in major indices.As you can see, institutional investors have a fair amount of stake in Intuit. This can indicate that the company has a certain degree of credibility in the investment community. However, it is best to be wary of relying on the supposed validation that comes with institutional investors. They too, get it wrong sometimes. If multiple institutions change their view on a stock at the same time, you could see the share price drop fast. It's therefore worth looking at Intuit's earnings history below. Of course, the future is what really matters.earnings-and-revenue-growthInstitutional investors own over 50% of the company, so together than can probably strongly influence board decisions. We note that hedge funds don't have a meaningful investment in Intuit. Looking at our data, we can see that the largest shareholder is The Vanguard Group, Inc. with 8.6% of shares outstanding. With 8.6% and 6.3% of the shares outstanding respectively, BlackRock, Inc. and T. Rowe Price Group, Inc. are the second and third largest shareholders.Story continuesAfter doing some more digging, we found that the top 22 have the combined ownership of 51% in the company, suggesting that no single shareholder has significant control over the company.While studying institutional ownership for a company can add value to your research, it is also a good practice to research analyst recommendations to get a deeper understand of a stock's expected performance. There are a reasonable number of analysts covering the stock, so it might be useful to find out their aggregate view on the future.Insider Ownership Of IntuitThe definition of an insider can differ slightly between different countries, but members of the board of directors always count. Company management run the business, but the CEO will answer to the board, even if he or she is a member of it.Most consider insider ownership a positive because it can indicate the board is well aligned with other shareholders. However, on some occasions too much power is concentrated within this group.Our most recent data indicates that insiders own some shares in Intuit Inc.. Insiders own US$3.1b worth of shares (at current prices). we sometimes take an interest in  whether they have been buying or selling. General Public OwnershipThe general public, who are usually individual investors, hold a 12% stake in Intuit. While this group can't necessarily call the shots, it can certainly have a real influence on how the company is run.Next Steps:While it is well worth considering the different groups that own a company, there are other factors that are even more important.

(NYSE:EL). The company's stock received a lot of attention from a substantial price movement on the NYSE over the last few months, increasing to US$282 at one point, and dropping to the lows of US$216. Some share price movements can give investors a better opportunity to enter into the stock, and potentially buy at a lower price. A question to answer is whether Estée Lauder Companies' current trading price of US$220 reflective of the actual value of the large-cap? Or is it currently undervalued, providing us with the opportunity to buy? Let’s take a look at Estée Lauder Companies’s outlook and value based on the most recent financial data to see if there are any catalysts for a price change. View our latest analysis for Estée Lauder Companies What's The Opportunity In Estée Lauder Companies?Good news, investors! Estée Lauder Companies is still a bargain right now. My valuation model shows that the intrinsic value for the stock is $291.66, which is above what the market is valuing the company at the moment. This indicates a potential opportunity to buy low. Although, there may be another chance to buy again in the future. This is because Estée Lauder Companies’s beta (a measure of share price volatility) is high, meaning its price movements will be exaggerated relative to the rest of the market. If the market is bearish, the company's shares will likely fall by more than the rest of the market, providing a prime buying opportunity.What kind of growth will Estée Lauder Companies generate?earnings-and-revenue-growthFuture outlook is an important aspect when you’re looking at buying a stock, especially if you are an investor looking for growth in your portfolio. Buying a great company with a robust outlook at a cheap price is always a good investment, so let’s also take a look at the company's future expectations. With profit expected to grow by 47% over the next couple of years, the future seems bright for Estée Lauder Companies. It looks like higher cash flow is on the cards for the stock, which should feed into a higher share valuation.Story continuesWhat This Means For YouAre you a shareholder? Since EL is currently undervalued, it may be a great time to increase your holdings in the stock. With an optimistic outlook on the horizon, it seems like this growth has not yet been fully factored into the share price. However, there are also other factors such as financial health to consider, which could explain the current undervaluation.Are you a potential investor? If you’ve been keeping an eye on EL for a while, now might be the time to make a leap. Its buoyant future outlook isn’t fully reflected in the current share price yet, which means it’s not too late to buy EL. But before you make any investment decisions, consider other factors such as the track record of its management team, in order to make a well-informed investment decision.With this in mind, we wouldn't consider investing in a stock unless we had a thorough understanding of the risks.

You can skip our detailed analysis of dividend stocks and their returns in the past, and go directly to read 5 Monthly Dividend Stocks with Over 4% Yield. Dividend stocks are outperforming this year as high-interest rates and inflation pull down the market. Dividend companies that make regular distributions to shareholders and have raised their payouts for years are valuable in times of financial instability. These companies tend to have stable cash flow generation and solid balance sheets to support shareholder returns. Some of the best dividend stocks in this context are The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO), Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ), and The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG).Over the years, dividend stocks have delivered long-term returns to shareholders during inflationary periods. According to a report published by BMO Capital Markets, dividend-paying stocks’ annual average return stood at 7.8% from 1998 to 2013, compared with a 2.4% annual average return of non-dividend stocks. During this period, the S&amp;P 500 returned 4.3%, significantly underperforming the dividend-paying securities. Another report by T. Rowe Price showed that dividend growers dominated during the down markets. From December 1985 to December 2020, dividend growers fell by 12.1% on average, compared to a 27.9% drop in non-dividend payers. The report further mentioned that with moderate returns of the broader markets, dividend companies offering yields between 2% to 3% are favorable investment options.Robert D. Arnott, the founder of Research Affiliates, talked about the significant representation of dividends in overall long-term market returns in his interview with Danske Invest. He mentioned that the average annual return from equities was 7.9% from 1802 to 2002, 5% of which was from dividends. The result shows that dividends were the main source of returns during this period. The report also mentioned that stocks with high dividend yields offer lower volatility and stronger downside protection during volatile times, compared with non-dividend paying stocks.Story continuesPhoto by Sharon McCutcheon on UnsplashOur Methodology: For this list, we selected monthly dividend stocks with yields over 4%.
