The last time the stock was this cheap, its earnings were half of what they were for the fourth quarter of 2022.SCHW 15-Year Financial DataThe intrinsic value of SCHWPeter Lynch Chart of SCHWCharles Schwab Goes on Sale Amid Bank SelloffSilicon Valley Bank brought the spotlight to some issues that had mostly been overlooked before. For one, most of the Treasury bonds that banks purchased at near-zero interest rates are now worth less money thanks to rising interest rates, so if banks are forced to sell these bonds, it would be at a loss. Another issue is deposit outflows, which could negatively impact net interest income and, in a worst-case scenario, result in capital issues.While these factors are likely to hurt Charles Schwabs earnings as the economy weakens further, the company has rushed to reassure the market that its financial position is strong. Granted it can come out the other side of economic turmoil intact, could Charles Schwab be a bargain after the recent selloff? Lets take a look.Stable financial positionPart of the recent panic surrounding Charles Schwab is likely due to the companys February 2023 monthly activity report released on Monday, which revealed it had experienced a 28% decline in margin balances and a 4% decline in total client assets compared to the same month of 2022.In light of the Silicon Valley Bank situation, Charles Schwab took the initiative on its February report to allay investors fears, noting these developments were well within its expectations of client cash realignment decisions. Moreover, the company said, we still believe client cash realignment decisions will largely abate during 2023. Since client cash realignment trends would only be likely to change if the Federal Reserve were to stop hiking interest rates or lower them again, we can surmise Charles Schwab is betting on rate hikes being done with by the time 2024 rolls around, though of course that is all speculation for now.Story continuesIs it a possibility the company could run out of cash? It seems unlikely. Charles Schwab reassured investors it has access to significant liquidity, which includes approximately $100 billion from cash on hand, portfolio-related cash flows and estimated net new assets for the next 12 months, as well as $8 billion per month in retail CD issuances and $300 billion in short-term loan capacity. Total client assets were $7.38 trillion as of the end of February, though the vast majority of these assets were in investments of various types, so in the case of a sale, their expenses would be covered by the buyers.""More than 80% of our total bank deposits fall within the (Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation) insurance limits,"" said the company in a statement, which is in stark contrast to Silicon Valley Bank, where most deposits fell well outside the FDIC range. Thus, there is no need for most of Charles Schwabs customers to panic, drastically reducing the likelihood of a run on deposits.How low could earnings go?Historically, Charles Schwab derived most of its revenue from the brokerage business through things like direct commissions, transaction fees and payment for order flow. This business is negatively impacted by declines in stock market activity, as less stock market activity means less order flow.With the exception of payment for order flow, these revenue streams have declined due to the advent of zero-fee transactions. Payment for order flow has had to pick up the slack, though it is a small price to pay for remaining competitive. Rather than selling order flow to the highest bidder, Charles Schwab has a policy of setting the same price across the board and routing trades to the market maker that offers each client the best execution, which has helped it gain popularity.In recent years, Charles Schwab has been diversifying more of its revenue through banking, and in its latest fourth-quarter earnings report, the company noted that approximately $10.7 billion of its total annual revenue for 2022 was net interest revenue. Net interest revenue is the difference between interest earned on bonds and loans and interest paid out to funding sources.Net interest revenue reached $10.7 billion, an increase of 33% versus the prior year, as higher interest rates more than offset the impact of balance sheet contraction due to client cash sorting, the company said in its fourth-quarter earnings report.As interest rates rise, loans can garner more revenue, but investors tend to be less willing to let cash sit in their accounts as there are more attractive low-risk or even risk-free assets available such as U.S. Treasury bonds. No asset is truly risk-free, but the U.S. government has never defaulted on its debt before as of this writing, so its debt is broadly considered to be risk-free. Cash balances built up in recent years as near-zero interest rates were followed by a stock market crash, but that landscape is changing now that interest rates are rising again.In summary, there are two main dangers facing Charles Schwabs earnings in the near term: declines in trading volume and further balance sheet contraction as clients move funds to higher-yielding assets. Advisor services (which made up about 25% of 2022 revenue) could also take a hit due to lower trading volume. How much this could impact the companys earnings per share is anyones guess as it depends on the markets behavior, but we do know that after the March 2020 market crash, earnings per share dropped as low as 48 cents per share, driven by lower stock market trading volume and near-zero interest rates.Valuation in perspectiveAs of March 13, the GF Value chart rated Charles Schwab as significantly undervalued based on a combination of historical returns, past valuation multiples and estimates of future business performance:Charles Schwab Goes on Sale Amid Bank SelloffThus, as long as the company keeps up its growth trajectory in the long term, it could be considered undervalued at the moment.According to the discounted cash flow calculator, the company would only need to grow its earnings per share by about 8% per year on average for the next decade in order to be fairly valued at current levels, which is much lower than the past 10-year growth rate of 18% or even the past five-year growth rate of 12.40%.As with most stocks, there is still plenty of downside potential left if the economy enters a full-blown recession or the stock market crashes. However, Charles Schwab is positioning itself well for long-term growth with a client-focused strategy that could help it continue winning more market share.TakeawayCharles Shwabs stock has gone on sale following the Silicon Valley Bank failure, but with a solid balance sheet and 80% of cash deposits being fully covered by FDIC insurance, it seems highly unlikely that the brokerage giant will go belly-up.The question for investors then becomes whether the stock is undervalued compared to its long-term potential. While there is no doubt room for further downside potential in the short term, especially with the possibility of a recession factored in, Charles Schwabs focus on providing clients the best services should help it gain market share in the long term, and its earnings should naturally recover along with the market as well.This article first appeared on GuruFocus.]"

We've got to talk about the regional banks. First Republic Bank, a Charles Schwab, a Zions Bank, Bancorp have really been on the move the last several days following the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank last Friday, and then also what we saw Signature Bank over the weekend. First Republic Bank closing off the last two days, a loss of 67%.Even today, we were looking at a loss of nearly 62%, that five-day chart really illustrating the downward slope that we have certainly seen at least in extended trading, recouping some of those earlier losses, really just a fraction of it. We're seeing similar pressure in Charles Schwab. Now over the last five days, that stock off just about 32%. It closed today off just around 11 and 1/2%, so paring some of the steeper losses that we saw during the interday trading after the bank did come out defending its portfolio, trying to reassure some of that skepticism that's out there from investors in extended trading. We're looking at gains of just about 1%.And Zions was off 25% today, moving slightly to the upside in extended trading. Of course, these are all among our top trending tickers here at Yahoo Finance. That has been the case for at least the last 24 hours. It likely will be the case going forward here as the fallout and we work through some of the latest headlines and pertains to Silicon Valley Bank and also Signature Bank, some very important stocks to keep an eye on here.Let's also talk about United Airlines. Switching gears here just a bit, the company out with updated guidance. And we're seeing the disappointment reflected in extended trading, with the stock off just over 6%. The company now says that it sees its Q1 adjusted EPS loss of $0.60 to a dollar. One of the reasons for that, some of the expenses related to a new collective bargaining agreement with Airline Pilots Association. Originally, they were expecting that charge in the second quarter. They moved that up to the first quarter. That's why we're seeing the stock under pressure, off just about 6 and 1/2% because of that revised loss per share outlook from United for the current quarter right now.The company, though, is saying that it does still see strong demand environment. It now expects Q1 operating revenue to be up about 51% compared to the level that we saw during Q1 2022. But that movement forward here from the quarter for its new collective bargaining agreement, the expenses there dragging the results potentially lower here in the current quarter. That's why the stock's off nearly 7%.]"

14,efb5b179-630a-357c-8e66-6c1fec47b53b,ARE,2023-03-14,3 Top Dividend Stocks to Maximize Your Retirement Income,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/3-top-dividend-stocks-maximize-131001586.html,1678713001,STORY,"['ARE', 'BMY']","[Strange but true: seniors fear death less than running out of money in retirement.Also, retirees who have constructed a nest egg have valid justifications to be concerned, since the traditional ways to plan for retirement may mean income can no longer cover expenses. Some retirees are now tapping their principal to make a decent living, pressed for time between decreasing investment balances and longer life expectancies.Your parents' retirement investing plan won't cut it today.For many years, bonds or other fixed-income assets could produce the yield needed to provide solid income for retirement needs. However, these yields have dwindled over time: 10-year Treasury bond rates in the late 1990s were around 6.50%, but today, that rate is a thing of the past, with a slim likelihood of rates making a comeback in the foreseeable future.The effect of this drop in rates is substantial: over 20 years, the change in yield for a $1 million investment in 10-year Treasuries is over $1 million.And lower bond yields aren't the only potential problem seniors are facing. Today's retirees aren't feeling as secure as they once did about Social Security, either. Benefit checks will still be coming for the foreseeable future, but based on current estimates, Social Security funds will run out of money in 2035.So what's a retiree to do? You could cut your expenses to the bone, and take the risk that your Social Security checks don't shrink. Or you could find an alternative investment that provides a steady, higher-rate income stream to replace dwindling bond yields.Invest in Dividend StocksAs we see it, dividend-paying stocks from generally low-risk, top notch companies are a brilliant way to create steady and solid income streams to supplant low risk, low yielding Treasury and fixed-income alternatives.Look for stocks that have paid steady, increasing dividends for years (or decades), and have not cut their dividends even during recessions.Story continuesOne approach to recognizing appropriate stocks is to look for companies with an average dividend yield of 3% and positive average annual dividend growth. Numerous stocks hike dividends over time, counterbalancing inflation risks.Here are three dividend-paying stocks retirees should consider for their nest egg portfolio.Alexandria Real Estate Equities (ARE) is currently shelling out a dividend of $1.21 per share, with a dividend yield of 3.82%. This compares to the REIT and Equity Trust - Other industry's yield of 4.76% and the S&amp;P 500's yield of 1.76%. The company's annualized dividend growth in the past year was 5.22%. Check Alexandria Real Estate Equities (ARE) dividend history here&gt;&gt;&gt;Bristol Myers Squibb (BMY) is paying out a dividend of $0.57 per share at the moment, with a dividend yield of 3.47% compared to the Medical - Biomedical and Genetics industry's yield of 0% and the S&amp;P 500's yield. The annualized dividend growth of the company was 10.2% over the past year. Check Bristol Myers Squibb (BMY) dividend history here&gt;&gt;&gt;Currently paying a dividend of $0.38 per share, CTO Realty (CTO) has a dividend yield of 9.34%. This is compared to the REIT and Equity Trust - Other industry's yield of 4.76% and the S&amp;P 500's current yield. Annualized dividend growth for the company in the past year was 14%. Check CTO Realty (CTO) dividend history here&gt;&gt;&gt;But aren't stocks generally more risky than bonds?Yes, that's true. As a broad category, bonds carry less risk than stocks. However, the stocks we are talking about - dividend -paying stocks from high-quality companies - can generate income over time and also mitigate the overall volatility of your portfolio compared to the stock market as a whole.Combating the impact of inflation is one advantage of owning these dividend-paying stocks. Here's why: many of these stable, high-quality companies increase their dividends over time, which translates to rising dividend income that offsets the effects of inflation.Thinking about dividend-focused mutual funds or ETFs? Watch out for fees.If you're thinking, ""I want to invest in a dividend-focused ETF or mutual fund,"" make sure to do your homework. It's important to know that some mutual funds and specialized ETFs charge high fees, which may diminish your dividend gains or income and thwart the overall objective of this investment strategy. If you do want to invest in fund, research well to identify the best-quality dividend funds with the least charges.Bottom LineRegardless of whether you select high-quality, low-fee funds or stocks, looking for a steady stream of income from dividend-paying equities can potentially lead you to a solid and more peaceful retirement.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

The consensus estimate has been stable over the past 30 days.This clothing, accessories, footwear and home products retailer has a trailing four-quarter negative earnings surprise of 68.1%, on average.Key Factors to NoteLands' End’s quarterly results might have been hurt by the impacts of a challenging macro environment. Inflationary pressures on consumer discretionary spending and global supply-chain pressures remain deterrents. These along with any deleverage in selling and administrative expenses, and other costs might have hurt Lands' End’s profitability in the fiscal quarter under review.On its last earnings call, management had cited that the fourth quarter will be greatly promotional. Lands’ End envisioned revenues of $510-$530 million and earnings per share of break-even to 9 cents for the fiscal fourth quarter. It had projected an adjusted EBITDA of $20-$25 million for the to-be-reported quarter. This guidance assumes nearly flat transportation expenses stemming from supply-chain bottlenecks.On the flip side, the company’s e-commerce business and brand strength appear encouraging. We note that enhanced data analytics capabilities and improved inventory management are tailwinds. LE’s consumer-centric approach, product initiatives, technological advancements and brand awareness are other positives.What the Zacks Model UnveilsOur proven model does not conclusively predict an earnings beat for Lands' End this time around.

And rightly so, because at bottom, these banks collapsed due to a lack of liquid assets. In sort, these banks did not have enough liquidity to cover severe funding outflows.The affected banks, especially SVB, were hit by a run – that is, depositors came calling to withdraw cash assets – and they lacked the liquid resources to meet that demand. Best practices in the banking industry would require an institution to keep a liquidity coverage ratio sufficient to cover all accounts; that is, high-quality liquid assets suitable to cover cash demand for 30 days. Without such coverage, the bank cannot meet depositor demand, and will rapidly fall into insolvency.Against this backdrop, J.P. Morgan analyst Vivek Juneja has highlighted two big names that have more than enough liquidity to cover rapid cash demands.Noting that each has the potential to generate double-digit returns for investors, the 5-star analyst rates them both as ‘Buys.’US Bancorp (USB)We’ll start with US Bancorp, the parent company of US Bank. This Minneapolis-based bank holding company is the country’s 5th largest banking institution, with $674.8 billion in total assets, more than 3,100 brick-and-mortar banking branches, and over 4,800 ATM machines. The bank operates mainly in the West and Midwest of the US, and is considered by Federal regulators to be a ‘systemically important’ banking institution.In the most important metric, for right now, JPMorgan’s Juneja notes that US Bancorp has a liquidity coverage ratio of 122%. For depositors, this means that the bank has nearly 1/4 more cash than is required to meet 30-days’ demand; from an investors’ perspective, it means that the bank has a degree of insulation in event of a crisis.Story continuesHowever, like most of the bank stocks on Wall Street, USB shares dropped 20% in the past three trading days. For Juneja, that may seem like the kind of dip that could be a buying opportunity.“Earnings should benefit in 2023 from a large amount of noninterest bearing deposits from UB and cost synergies. However, management also expects sizable growth in non-interest income in 2023… We rate U.S. Bancorp Overweight relative to peers as it should benefit more than peers from continued strong consumer spending, which should drive growth in card-related fees. US Bancorp has higher share of revenues from card-related fees,” Juneja opined.Looking forward from this stance, Juneja adds a $52.50 price target, implying a 44% one-year upside potential, to go along with his Overweight (i.e. Buy) rating on the shares. (To watch Juneja’s track record, click here)Overall, there are 17 analyst reviews on file for USB, breaking down to 7 Buys and 10 Holds and giving the stock a Moderate Buy analyst consensus rating. The stock is selling for $36.54 and has an average price target of $54.78, suggesting ~50% upside on the one-year horizon.

For four weeks in the Kansas City area, they can be found in front of stores, in neighborhoods and at local events selling cookies to all. What isn't seen, however, are the bankers who stand behind them.""I love supporting these young entrepreneurs,"" said Steven Sickmeyer, a small business banking specialist with U.S. Bank in the Kansas City area. ""I want to help give them a sense of business ownership.""A sense of ownership that first came to Sickmeyer in July 2022, when two Girl Scout troop leaders from the Girl Scouts of Northeast Kansas and Northwest Missouri set up an appointment looking for help.At their previous bank, troop leaders struggled with a variety of challenges including not having a banker to provide in-person support, being restricted to ATM-only deposits, and requiring everyone to be in the same room at the same time to make changes to accounts.""Our banking and treasury management is complicated,"" said Shari Wyly, the CFO of the Girl Scouts of Northeast Kansas and Northwest Missouri. ""There is banking for the council and then there is troop banking… and troop banking now has a lot of autonomy in deciding where they want to bank.""Late last year, about 600 troops that are a part of the Girl Scout council began the process of looking for a new banking home that could provide everything from checking to merchant services.""When we first started this process of helping those troops solidify relationships with a bank, we were reaching out to every single bank in the area,"" said Dawn Hewitt, customer care specialist at Girl Scouts of Northeast Kansas and Northwest Missouri. ""When Steven came in and said he could be our one point of contact… well, it was like the clouds parting and sunshine coming through.""Story continuesFrom there, things started moving quickly.""We had a lot of people working to get their finances straight before cookie sales started,"" said Kathy Smith, the volunteer support specialist with the Girl Scouts council. ""They all needed to know where their money was going and how to get there.""That's where Sickmeyer and U.S. Bank branch teams stepped in, providing non-profit checking accounts, using technology that allowed for virtual docu-signing, and setting up merchant services. Then, when Sickmeyer was away from the office to volunteer for several weeks, he had a plan in place to make sure the Girl Scouts didn't go without support.""My team and I, at one point, were opening accounts for Girl Scout troops by the handful every day,"" said Jessica Fairchild, a branch manager in Blue Springs, Missouri. ""Since then, we've been there for them to provide that in-person support they were lacking at a previous bank as well as help them take advantage of our digital solutions like the U.S. Bank mobile app.""Now, more than half-a-year later, the success of the partnership between the U.S. Bank team and the Girl Scouts is seen in each cookie sale.""I appreciate the relationship and that we are able in to, in good conscious and good faith, say that U.S. Bank is a good option for our troops,"" said Wyly.To learn more about U.S. Bank, click here.View additional multimedia and more ESG storytelling from U.S. Bank on 3blmedia.com.Contact Info:Spokesperson: U.S. BankWebsite: https://www.3blmedia.com/profiles/us-bankEmail: info@3blmedia.comSOURCE: U.S. BankView source version on accesswire.com: https://www.accesswire.com/743418/Supporting-Young-Entrepreneurs-One-Cookie-Sale-at-a-Time-With-the-Girl-Scouts]"

You can skip our detailed analysis of dividend stocks and their historical performance, and go directly to read 5 Under-the-Radar High Dividend Stocks to Buy. The global economy has take a massive hit last year due to elevated inflation, rising interest rates and geopolitical uncertainty. The world economy is slowing as IMF forecasted global growth to slow to 2.3% this year from 6% in 2021 and 3.2% last year. Analysts and economists have also hinted toward the possible financial crisis in 2023. In the US, 24% of economists surveyed by the World Economic Forum expect high inflation this year, whereas 91% expect weak economic growth. The sizzling inflation and the risks of a possible recession have altered investor sentiment.Considering the current market situation and investment scenarios, analysts recommend putting money in dividend stocks as they have the ability to open up regular income channels for investors. David Rosenberg of Rosenberg Research and Associates spoke to MarketWatch about possible investment strategies in the high-interest rates period in February. He mentioned that investors should focus on defensive sectors of the financial markets, including dividend-paying stocks. He further said that dividend companies with strong balance sheets and dividend payouts endure periods of financial volatility better than their peers.Many other reports conform to Rosenberg’s analysis, revealing the strong performance of dividend stocks in high-interest rates periods. According to iShares, the S&amp;P 500 Dividend Payers fell by 7.6% last year, compared with a 21.1% decline in the S&amp;P 500 Non-Dividend Payers. The report also mentioned that in the 1940s and the 1907s, when inflation was at its record high, dividends contributed 53% and 50% of the stock market’s total return. Another report by Nuveen throws light on the importance of high-dividend stocks and how healthy dividend yields generate better returns for shareholders. According to the report, dividend payers with yields above 3% delivered an annual average return of 8.1% in 2022, versus a 6.7% return of the MSCI World Index.Story continuesDividend investing usually brings well-known companies into focus. Investors are inclined toward quality companies that have proven track records of dividend growth and strong balance sheets. The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO), PepsiCo, Inc. (NASDAQ:PEP), and The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG) are some companies that are most popular among income investors. However, several other, lesser known companies also have strong dividend policies that would be great investment options in the current market situation.

(Nasdaq: MCHP) – a leading provider of smart, connected and secure embedded control solutions – has reached a milestone in its multi-year, $800 million initiative aiming to triple production capacity at its Gresham, Oregon manufacturing facility. Celebrating close to the halfway mark in a major workforce expansion and capital equipment investment, the efforts are part of Microchip’s larger initiative to ramp up overall production in the U.S. as demand continues to grow for semiconductor products across a broad range of industries.“We want to recognize the Microchip Gresham team for their dedication and ongoing hard work on this expansion and thank the state of Oregon and its elected officials for the incentives they have approved in support of its completion,” said Ganesh Moorthy, President and CEO of Microchip Technology. “Our steady growth demonstrates the vital role of semiconductors and the importance of the CHIPS &amp; Science Act for providing the economic support required to help level the global playing field for U.S. companies.”Working with the Business Oregon state economic development agency, the City of Gresham and Multnomah County, Microchip has been approved to receive state and local incentives of approximately $42.4 million for the expansion.“This good news for Gresham opens a fresh chapter for Oregon’s semiconductor industry with the new federal CHIPS &amp; Science Act generating local dividends in the form of good-paying jobs and economic investment in our state,” said Senator Ron Wyden. “I’m proud to have worked on getting this semiconductor bill into law last year, and will keep pressing on all fronts to ensure Oregonians and the semiconductor companies that employ them benefit from this landmark legislation.”“Oregon continues to be the center of excellence for semiconductor manufacturing in the country,” Governor Tina Kotek said. “The state’s focus on economic development led to Microchip expanding its operations in Gresham. This is a win for the city, state and nation: it will bring good-paying jobs to the community, keep Oregon a national leader in chip production, and strengthen our country’s manufacturing, supply chain, and national security.”Story continuesMicrochip has added 300 new employees to its Gresham facility so far, with plans to hire as many as 300 more over the next few years. The company has also made substantial progress expanding and upgrading its 140-acre, 830,000-square-foot Gresham campus so it can manufacture higher volumes of its microcontroller, analog and security products. As part of the investment, Microchip is adding two cleanrooms and more than 160 new tools to its facility, which produces semiconductors from 8-inch wafers.“Microchip continues to be focused on manufacturing legacy chips—the small, ubiquitous microcontrollers and analog products that power virtually every type of electronic device, including things like cars and e-bikes, home appliances, industrial motors and so much more. The growth of these products is critical for growing local, family wage jobs in Oregon and strengthening supply chains right here in the United States,” said Congressman Earl Blumenauer.“This expansion is a tremendous achievement for the City of Gresham and will go a long way in providing jobs and contributing to a thriving economy for our city,” said Gresham Mayor Travis Stovall. “We are grateful for the partnership with Microchip Technology as well as the support from our Oregon legislators in moving this important work forward.”Microchip currently employs more than 900 people at its Gresham campus, with an additional 300 contractors working on-site. The jobs being created at the facility range from production specialists to technical roles in equipment and process engineering, facilities and management.“Microchip established the Gresham site more than two decades ago, and it remains our largest and most advanced internal fabrication facility and an integral element of our long-term microcontroller and analog business strategies,” said Steve Drehobl, senior vice president of Microchip’s 8-bit and 16-bit business units. “Our $800 million expansion initiative here will enable us to better serve customers worldwide.”Microchip has more than 120,000 customers across the industrial, automotive, consumer, communications, computing and aerospace and defense markets.

(NYSE:MET) shareholders are probably generally happy, the stock hasn't had particularly good run recently, with the share price falling 19% in the last quarter. But that doesn't undermine the rather lovely longer-term return, if you measure over the last three years. Indeed, the share price is up a very strong 120% in that time. It's not uncommon to see a share price retrace a bit, after a big gain. The fundamental business performance will ultimately dictate whether the top is in, or if this is a stellar buying opportunity.While this past week has detracted from the company's three-year return, let's look at the recent trends of the underlying business and see if the gains have been in alignment. See our latest analysis for MetLife There is no denying that markets are sometimes efficient, but prices do not always reflect underlying business performance. One way to examine how market sentiment has changed over time is to look at the interaction between a company's share price and its earnings per share (EPS).During the three years of share price growth, MetLife actually saw its earnings per share (EPS) drop 21% per year.So we doubt that the market is looking to EPS for its main judge of the company's value. Given this situation, it makes sense to look at other metrics too.Do you think that shareholders are buying for the 1.3% per annum revenue growth trend? We don't. While we don't have an obvious theory to explain the share price rise, a closer look at the data might be enlightening.The image below shows how earnings and revenue have tracked over time (if you click on the image you can see greater detail).earnings-and-revenue-growthMetLife is well known by investors, and plenty of clever analysts have tried to predict the future profit levels. You can see what analysts are predicting for MetLife in this interactive graph of future profit estimates.What About Dividends?When looking at investment returns, it is important to consider the difference between total shareholder return (TSR) and share price return. The TSR is a return calculation that accounts for the value of cash dividends (assuming that any dividend received was reinvested) and the calculated value of any discounted capital raisings and spin-offs. Arguably, the TSR gives a more comprehensive picture of the return generated by a stock. We note that for MetLife the TSR over the last 3 years was 145%, which is better than the share price return mentioned above. And there's no prize for guessing that the dividend payments largely explain the divergence!Story continuesA Different PerspectiveWhile it's certainly disappointing to see that MetLife shares lost 6.1% throughout the year, that wasn't as bad as the market loss of 7.3%. Longer term investors wouldn't be so upset, since they would have made 8%, each year, over five years. It could be that the business is just facing some short term problems, but shareholders should keep a close eye on the fundamentals. While it is well worth considering the different impacts that market conditions can have on the share price, there are other factors that are even more important. Take risks, for example - MetLife has   3 warning signs  (and 1 which doesn't sit too well with us)  we think you should know about.For those who like to find winning investments this free list of growing companies with recent insider purchasing, could be just the ticket.Please note, the market returns quoted in this article reflect the market weighted average returns of stocks that currently trade on US exchanges.Have feedback on this article?

The above amount includes $4.1 billion of investments made for unaffiliated institutional clients.MIM originated $8.5 billion, $1.9 billion and $4.7 billion worth of private placement in corporate, structured credit and infrastructure, respectively. It also added 94 new issuers to the portfolio. This aligns with MIM’s objective of diversifying across different issuers to protect its client’s wealth.The corporate private placements team achieved growth in origination volume in the past year, owing to the strength of sourcing capabilities and relationships with agent banks, boutique advisory firms and its direct origination platform. This was achieved despite a slowdown in capital markets.With the core focus being diversification, corporate private placement origination of $3.1 billion was spread across U.K. and European issuers. It accounted for 37% of total origination for 2022. Credit tenant leases origination volume grew 50% from 2021, indicating MIM’s efforts on executing the opportunities in this sector. MIM’s private structured credit investments were well diversified across commercial property assessed clean energy, low-income housing, residential credit, alternative financing and energy. Due to the increasing volatility of public-market pricing and increasing financial regulations, issuers are turning to private debt, which will increase private placement assets under MIM management and further increase MIM management fees.MIM also provides capital for social and economic infrastructure development projects, benefiting from stable and predictable cash flows. Infrastructure origination in 2022 was diversified across assets related to transportation like rail, airport, marine projects, ports and toll roads. The top five areas of investment in 2022 included renewable power, communication, water utilities and social housing assets and projects.Story continuesTotal Private Placement assets under management as of Dec 31, 2022, was $89.5 billion.Price PerformanceShares of MetLife have lost 13.8% year to date compared with the industry’sdecline of 9.8%.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchZacks Rank &amp; Key PicksMetLife Inc currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Some better-ranked stocks from the same space are CNO Financial Group CNO, Goosehead Insurance GSHD and Old Republic International ORI.All these companies sport a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) at present.

World oil consumption typically eases around this time, a softer patch between the end of winter and start of the summer driving season.The surplus could be even larger if production from Russian continues to prove resilient to international sanctions, because OPEC’s outlook assumes a sharp drop in the country’s output next quarter.READ: Russia’s Resilience May Thwart Predicted Oil Market Squeeze“There exist some upside potential and downside risks” to demand, OPEC’s Vienna-based research department said in the report on Tuesday. “Given the ongoing high level of uncertainty with regard to the timing and extent of a full global economic recovery to pre-pandemic levels,” the OPEC+ coalition will need to remain cautious.Led by Saudi Arabia, OPEC and its partners are restraining output to keep world markets in balance amid a shaky rebound in consumption and fragile economic outlook, which has faltered further this week in the wake of a bank collapse in the US. Oil prices plunged below $80 a barrel in London on Monday for the first time in a month.Despite this turmoil, OPEC largely left estimates for average global supply and demand this year unchanged, projecting that world consumption will climb by 2.3 million barrels a day to a record of 101.9 million a day.Story continuesThe group sharply increased estimates for supplies this quarter from Russia, which have remained surprisingly strong despite international sanctions over the invasion of Ukraine and Moscow’s threats of retaliatory cuts. OPEC expects Russia will pump 10.9 million barrels a day this quarter, about 620,000 barrels a day more than it estimated in last month’s report.Nevertheless, OPEC kept forecasts for Russian output during the rest of the year unchanged, predicting that it will plunge next quarter by 900,000 barrels a day — an even bigger drop than was witnessed during the international backlash when Moscow when launched its war a year ago.Key members of the OPEC+ coalition are due to hold an online monitoring session to review oil market conditions early next month, and a full ministerial meeting at its Vienna headquarters in June.

46,12483eb4-9647-32fa-8acf-48d4c7282469,O,2023-03-14,Alaska oil project approval adds yet another climate concern,AP Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/alaska-oil-project-approval-adds-050940011.html,1678770580,STORY,['CL=F'],"[JUNEAU, Alaska (AP) — The Biden administration’s approval of a massive oil development in northern Alaska commits the U.S. to yet another decadeslong crude project even as scientists urgently warn that only a halt to more fossil fuel emissions can stem climate change.ConocoPhillips’ Willow project would produce 180,000 barrels of oil a day at its peak, and using that crude would result in at least 263 million tons (239 million metric tons) of greenhouse gas emissions over 30 years.Demand for oil isn't dropping as the planet heats, and a bitter political dispute over the project, which was approved Monday, has underscored the Democratic administration’s struggle to balance economic pressures against pledges to curb fossil fuels. The proposal in the remote region north of the Arctic Circle also highlights the paradox facing the U.S. and other nations: The world’s transition to clean energy lags behind the reality of an economy still largely driven by oil consumption.“At some point, we have to leave oil and gas and coal in the ground. And for me, that some point is now — particularly in a vulnerable ecosystem like the Arctic,” said Rob Jackson, a climate scientist at Stanford University.Interior Secretary Deb Haaland, in announcing Willow's approval, stressed that the number of drill pads was reduced by 40% from ConocoPhillips' original proposal, which she said would benefit people and wildlife. But the company still is expected to get most of the oil it wanted, resulting in only an 8% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions, according to government estimates.For Alaska, the project promises an economic boost after oil production dropped sharply since the late 1980s. Leaders from both parties in the state united behind it. Oil has long been the state's economic lifeblood, with revenues helping remote communities and villages on Alaska’s petroleum-rich North Slope.But the state also has felt the impacts of climate change: coastal erosion is threatening Indigenous villages, unusual wildfires are popping up, sea ice is thinning and permafrost promises to release carbon as it melts.Story continuesAttorneys representing environmentalists and an Alaska Native group filed a lawsuit Tuesday asking a federal judge to block Willow's approval. The Sovereign Iñupiat for a Living Arctic, Sierra Club and other groups said Interior officials ignored the fact that every ton of greenhouse gasses emitted by the project would contribute to sea ice melt, which endangers polar bears and Alaskan villages.The International Energy Agency has said new drilling investments must be halted if nations, including the U.S., hope to reach their 2050 goal of net-zero emissions, meaning only as much planet-warming gas is released into the atmosphere as can be absorbed.The energy sector accounts for 90% of carbon dioxide emissions worldwide and three-quarters of the total human-made greenhouse gases.Yet global demand for crude is expected to continue rising, according to industry analysts and the U.S. Energy Information Administration.Instead of targeting domestic supplies of those fuels — including projects like Willow — energy expert Jim Krane said policymakers should focus on reducing demand.“If you target supply in the U.S. without any kind of measures to bring demand down, refiners are just going to pull their oil from overseas,” said Krane, of Rice University's Baker Institute for Public Policy.Electric vehicles offer a potential substitute for gasoline-powered cars and trucks, but so far they've barely dented fossil fuel demand. By 2030, EV is expected to displace 2.7 million barrels of oil a day, according to Enverus Intelligence Research, a data analysis firm focused on the energy industry.That’s less than 3% of global oil consumption, which in 2030 is anticipated to be about the same as current levels — roughly 100 million barrels a day, said Al Salazar, senior vice president of the research company.“Demand does not go to zero in a blink-of-the-eye,"" Salazar said. “It takes time to turn over the entire light duty vehicle fleet.”The Willow project is in the National Petroleum Reserve-Alaska, where Republican U.S. senators have noted drilling should be expected.Greenhouse gases from Willow would equal emissions from about 1.7 million cars, or just over 0.1% of the U.S. total. Interior Department officials for years have cited such relatively small percentages as justification for approvals of coal mines and oil and gas leases.Jackson said that perspective can’t continue if the worst effects of climate change are to be avoided. The planet is “as far from zero emissions as we've ever been” despite the emphasis on renewable energy.“It’s the same as thinking, well, every new car we put on the road or coal plant we build doesn’t matter because there are millions of other cars and thousands of other coal plants around the world operating,” he said.Prior to the Willow decision, the administration already had softened its opposition to oil and gas — a departure from the early days of Biden’s presidency. During negotiations over last year’s climate bill the administration agreed to tens of millions of acres of new leasing to get the support of Democratic holdout U.S. Sen. Joe Manchin, of West Virginia.Provisions in the measure link oil and gas leasing to renewable energy development. Consequently, the administration will offer for sale more than 73 million acres (29.5 million hectares) of oil and gas leases for sale March 29 in the Gulf of Mexico. Over several months beginning in May, it also plans to auction some 350,000 acres (141,600 hectares) of onshore oil and gas leases in Wyoming, New Mexico, Montana, Nevada and other states.Environmentalists say the Gulf sale alone could yield more than 1 billion barrels of oil over 50 years.“This administration has pledged to oversee a historic transition to clean energy, but actions speak louder than words,” said Earthjustice attorney George Torgun, who represents environmental groups trying to stop further lease sales.___Brown reported from Billings, Montana.]"

In addition, both contracts fell into technically oversold territory for the first time in weeks.Shockwaves from Silicon Valley Bank's collapse triggered big moves in bank shares as investors fretted over the financial health of some lenders, in spite of assurances from U.S. President Joe Biden and other global policymakers.""The market is either anticipating a recession in the future or it could be that one or more funds had to raise cash and reduce the risk on their books because they are concerned about liquidity after the bank failures,"" said Phil Flynn, an analyst at Price Futures Group. He has not heard of any fund in trouble.U.S. consumer prices increased solidly in February as Americans faced persistently higher costs for rents and food, posing a dilemma for the U.S. Federal Reserve whose fight against inflation has been complicated by the collapse of two regional banks.""Crude prices are falling after a mostly in-line inflation report sealed the deal for at least one more Fed rate hike,"" said Edward Moya, senior market analyst at data and analytics firm OANDA.Data showed the U.S. Consumer Price Index (CPI) rose 0.4% in February from 0.5% in January. That slight slowdown in consumer price growth prompted investors to price in a smaller rate hike by the Fed in March.The Fed is now seen raising its benchmark rate by just a quarter of a percentage point next week, down from a previously expected 50-basis points, and delivering another hike of the same size in May. The Fed's next two-day meeting starts next Tuesday.Story continues""The Fed’s tightening work is not done just yet and the chances are growing that they will send the economy into a mild recession, and risks remain that it could be a severe one,"" OANDA's Moya said.The U.S. central bank uses higher interest rates to curb inflation. But those higher rates increase consumer borrowing costs, which can slow the economy and reduce demand for oil.Tuesday's crude price decline also came ahead of U.S. data expected to show energy firms added about 1.2 million barrels of oil to crude stockpiles during the week ended March 10. [EIA/S] [API/S] [ENERGYUSA] [ENERGYAPI]The American Petroleum Institute (API), an industry group, will publish its inventory data at 4:30 p.m. EDT on Tuesday and the U.S. Energy Information Administration at 10:30 a.m. on Wednesday.Limiting crude's price decline - at least earlier in the day - was a monthly report from the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) projecting higher oil demand in China, the world's biggest oil importer, in 2023.Chinese consumers, unshackled from COVID-19 restrictions, are returning to hotels, restaurants and some shops, but they are choosy about what they buy, disappointing hopes for an immediate post-pandemic splurge.OPEC, however, left unchanged its forecast for world oil demand to increase by 2.32 million barrels per day, or 2.3%, in 2023.The International Energy Agency (IEA) will publish its monthly report on Wednesday.

The report provides an in-depth analysis of how well commercials from advertising's biggest stage first appeal to a consumer's primal brain before they can be understood by a consumer's rational brain. This process is also called System 1 and System 2 Thinking.KERN, An Omnicom Agency logoWhile trackers such as the USA TODAY Ad Meter rate ads based on what consumers say they like or dislike about them, neuroscience confirms that likes do not translate to purchase intent. KERN's report scientifically measures how consumers process, consider and remember these multimillion-dollar Super Bowl ads and evaluates them for their effectiveness of persuasion.Under the supervision of renowned neuroscientist Dr. Christophe Morin, a selection of high-profile Super Bowl commercials was analyzed using the direct observation of viewers, including eye-tracking, facial expressions monitoring and interest measurement. KERN has then advanced these findings and written lessons that are designed to help CRM marketers connect the power of brand storytelling to their customer communication programs through neuroscience principles of persuasion. This is done by applying the six stimuli of the primal brain to creative: Personal, Contrastable, Tangible, Memorable, Visual and Emotional.""For the first time, we took the learnings garnered from an extensive scientific review of this year's Super Bowl ads and applied them to the world of CRM marketing,"" said Russell Kern, CEO and Founder of KERN.You can download the full report at: www.kernagency.com/neuroi.About KERNKERN is an agency within Omnicom Group (NYSE: OMC), a leading global marketing and corporate communications company.

While media reports about rating changes by these brokerage-firm employed (or sell-side) analysts often affect a stock's price, do they really matter?Before we discuss the reliability of brokerage recommendations and how to use them to your advantage, let's see what these Wall Street heavyweights think about Salesforce.com (CRM).Salesforce.com currently has an average brokerage recommendation (ABR) of 1.81, on a scale of 1 to 5 (Strong Buy to Strong Sell), calculated based on the actual recommendations (Buy, Hold, Sell, etc.) made by 37 brokerage firms. An ABR of 1.81 approximates between Strong Buy and Buy.Of the 37 recommendations that derive the current ABR, 22 are Strong Buy and two are Buy. Strong Buy and Buy respectively account for 59.5% and 5.4% of all recommendations.Brokerage Recommendation Trends for CRMBroker Rating Breakdown Chart for CRMCheck price target &amp; stock forecast for Salesforce.com here&gt;&gt;&gt;While the ABR calls for buying Salesforce.com, it may not be wise to make an investment decision solely based on this information. Several studies have shown limited to no success of brokerage recommendations in guiding investors to pick stocks with the best price increase potential.Are you wondering why? The vested interest of brokerage firms in a stock they cover often results in a strong positive bias of their analysts in rating it. Our research shows that for every ""Strong Sell"" recommendation, brokerage firms assign five ""Strong Buy"" recommendations.This means that the interests of these institutions are not always aligned with those of retail investors, giving little insight into the direction of a stock's future price movement. It would therefore be best to use this information to validate your own analysis or a tool that has proven to be highly effective at predicting stock price movements.Zacks Rank, our proprietary stock rating tool with an impressive externally audited track record, categorizes stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), and is an effective indicator of a stock's price performance in the near future. Therefore, using the ABR to validate the Zacks Rank could be an efficient way of making a profitable investment decision.Story continuesZacks Rank Should Not Be Confused With ABRIn spite of the fact that Zacks Rank and ABR both appear on a scale from 1 to 5, they are two completely different measures.The ABR is calculated solely based on brokerage recommendations and is typically displayed with decimals (example: 1.28). In contrast, the Zacks Rank is a quantitative model allowing investors to harness the power of earnings estimate revisions. It is displayed in whole numbers -- 1 to 5.It has been and continues to be the case that analysts employed by brokerage firms are overly optimistic with their recommendations. Because of their employers' vested interests, these analysts issue more favorable ratings than their research would support, misguiding investors far more often than helping them.On the other hand, earnings estimate revisions are at the core of the Zacks Rank. And empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.In addition, the different Zacks Rank grades are applied proportionately to all stocks for which brokerage analysts provide current-year earnings estimates. In other words, this tool always maintains a balance among its five ranks.Another key difference between the ABR and Zacks Rank is freshness. The ABR is not necessarily up-to-date when you look at it. But, since brokerage analysts keep revising their earnings estimates to account for a company's changing business trends, and their actions get reflected in the Zacks Rank quickly enough, it is always timely in indicating future price movements.Should You Invest in CRM?Looking at the earnings estimate revisions for Salesforce.com, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has increased 54.9% over the past month to $6.96.Analysts' growing optimism over the company's earnings prospects, as indicated by strong agreement among them in revising EPS estimates higher, could be a legitimate reason for the stock to soar in the near term.The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) for Salesforce.com. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stocks here &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Therefore, the Buy-equivalent ABR for Salesforce.com may serve as a useful guide for investors.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

If you want to read about some more clothing companies, go directly to the 5 Most Valuable Clothing Companies in the World.After experiencing 18 months of robust growth (early 2021 through mid-2022), the clothing industry faces a challenging climate once again. Hyperinflation and depressed customer sentiments had already resulted in declining growth rates in the second half of 2022, and a slowdown is likely to persist this year. The Russia-Ukraine war has disrupted the chances of global economic recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic, at least in the short term. This has led to economic sanctions on multiple countries, a steep rise in commodity prices, and supply chain disruptions, thus causing inflation across goods and services.According to a survey conducted by McKinsey, a global management consulting firm, clothing companies are anticipating a spike in their costs on account of inflation, with 97 % of surveyed executives forecasting that their cost of goods sold and selling, general and administrative (SG&amp;A) expenses will rise in 2023. Cotton and cashmere prices, for example, have increased 45% and 30% year-on-year, respectively. The fashion market, excluding the luxury sector, will struggle to deliver significant growth in 2023. McKinsey's analysis of fashion forecasts projects relatively slow sales growth of between –2% and +3%, weighed down by a contraction in the European market. China and the United States, on the other hand, are expected to fare better.The clothing industry, also known as the apparel market, includes clothing ranging from sportswear to business wear to daily wear to luxury products. The pandemic has acted as a massive restraint on the apparel manufacturing market in 2022 as supply chains were disrupted due to trade restrictions and consumption declined due to lockdowns imposed by governments globally. Despite this, the global clothing market has endured relatively better compared to other industries, growing from $610.12 billion in 2022 to $652.94 billion in 2023. In terms of future outlooks, the market is further expected to grow to $830.69 billion in 2027 at a CAGR of 6.2%. In global comparison, the United States led the charge with $343.70 billion in revenues. With intense competitive rivalry in the industry, leading companies have continued to provide product differentiation with a dynamic approach to meet the changing trends. Additionally, the increasing demand for online shopping is expected to help the apparel manufacturing market grow.Story continues15 Most Valuable Clothing Companies in the WorldPhoto by Keagan Henman on UnsplashOur MethodologyTo come up with the 15 most valuable clothing companies in the world, we used stock screeners to identify the biggest clothing companies by market capitalization. The list not only consists of pure play clothing companies, it also includes companies that are part of the apparel industry, namely clothing retailers, as well as companies whose product portfolios make them a part of other related industries as well, including sports.15.

As we evaluate go-forward plans, we are exploring different options to support future growth. Overall, our third quarter was a strong step in the right direction, yet we remain highly focused on driving further improvement. In an uncertain macro environment, we are leveraging the strength of our operations to control what we can and best position ourselves to respond effectively to changing macro conditions. As the supply chain environment continues to normalize, we are using this to our advantage. We are planning inventories tightly and exercising our capabilities to chase into demand. At the same time, we are also reducing expenses and capital expenditures with a firm focus on improving the bottom line and driving stronger free cash flow.14. The Gap, Inc.

We believe our elevated brand, clear strategy and targeted investments combined with our culture of operating discipline and fortress foundation enablers, put us in a position of strength to continue to drive long-term value creation.

Microsoft has also added safeguards to its search software.(Reporting By Jeffrey Dastin in Palo Alto, California; Editing by Jamie Freed)]"

Robust North America comps, expansion efforts and digital efforts are aiding the company’s performance. The company has an impressive long-term earnings growth rate of 17.2%.However, dismal performance in China and margin contraction remain concerns for the company. Let’s delve deeper.Growth DriversThe company’s North America comps impressed investors for the eighth straight quarter and rose 14% in the fiscal first quarter. The segment benefited from 10% growth in company-operated comparable store sales, new store growth and higher contribution from licensed store sales. Average ticket and transaction increased 9% and 1%, respectively.Despite the unfavorable economic conditions, the company is focusing on expansion efforts. In the first-quarter fiscal 2023, Starbucks opened 459 net new stores worldwide, bringing the total store count to 36,170.During fiscal 2023, the company expects store count in the United States and China to grow approximately 3% and 13%, respectively, on a year-over-year basis. The company expects global store growth to be nearly 7%. Capital expenditures in fiscal 2023 are estimated to be approximately $2.5 billion.This Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company is focusing on digitalization to drive growth. The company’s partnership with Alibaba for providing seamless Starbucks Experience continues to drive growth in China. Starbucks has introduced its mobile order and pay feature — Starbucks Now — to multiple platforms in the Alibaba Digital Economy, which includes Taobao, Amap, Koubei and Alipay.The company made progress with respect to personalized digital relationship to expand reach with members. This includes program enhancements like Stars for Everyone. Starbucks initiated payment partnerships with PayPal and Bakkt, thereby allowing customers to reload their Starbucks card through a range of cryptocurrencies (including Bitcoin and Ethereum) coupled with the option of converting digital currencies to physical currency.Despite dismal performance in China the company reiterated its guidance for fiscal 2023. Consolidated revenues are anticipated to grow in the range of 10-12% on a year-over-year basis. The company anticipates non-GAAP EPS growth to be at the low end of 15-20% range.Story continuesConcernsThe COVID-19 pandemic has negatively impacted the company’s performance in China. In the fiscal first quarter, comps in China declined 29% year over year (compared with a 16% fall reported in the previous quarter). The downtick was caused by a 28% decline in transactions and a 1% decrease in average tickets.China continues to battle COVID-19 resurgences and navigate through prolonged lockdowns. During second-quarter fiscal 2023, the company’s performance in China is also expected to be affected by COVID-19.The company’s margin in first-quarter fiscal 2023 was negatively impacted by inflationary pressures along with increased investments in labor growth (including enhanced store partner wages and new partner training). Reduced traffic in China (due to COVID-19 restrictions) also added to the woes. On a non-GAAP basis, the operating margin in fiscal first quarter was 14.4%, down from 14.6% reported in the prior-year quarter.Zacks Rank &amp; Key PicksSome better-ranked stocks in the Zacks Retail – Restaurants industry are Chuy's Holdings, Inc.

Burford claimed Sysco was preparing to settle for ""low-ball"" amounts and a ""pittance.""An arbitration panel awarded Burford a preliminary injunction in a 2-1 order on March 10, barring Sysco from finalizing its proposed settlements. Burford's new lawsuit in New York seeks confirmation of the arbitration panel's award.Burford's move comes after Sysco last week sued the Burford subsidiaries in Chicago federal court. Sysco accused the multibillion-dollar Burford of ""forcing Sysco to continue to litigate against its will.""Burford Capital CEO Christopher Bogart said in a statement that Sysco's Chicago case was ""frivolous."" The company, he said, seemed to be trying ""to score free media coverage"" before the arbitration panel issued its preliminary injunction ruling.Sysco said in a statement on Monday that the arbitrators' decision granting the injunction is contrary to precedent and public policy concerns about litigation control by funders.

For more companies, head on over to 10 Largest Software Companies in the World by Revenue. Hardware and software are the building blocks of modern day technology. Both have to work hand in hand, and generally speaking, hardware often ends up lagging software when it comes to product development. This is due to the fact that it takes years to develop hardware from the design process to the actual chip fabrication which often requires making the machines themselves in the most advanced cases, while in the case of software, development is relatively easier since it involves iterative upgrades to smooth out any bugs and introduce new features.The global software market is also one of the biggest in the world and also one that comes with higher margins since the product costs are lower. According to research from Sky Quest, the global software market was worth $547 billion in 2021 and will grow to $872 billion by 2028 through a compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) of 7.2%. The research firm believes that emerging trends such as artificial intelligence and the internet of things (IoT) have the potential to drive the market forward, with the fastest growing segment being the one in which no coding is required and the largest segment being one where there is low code required. It adds that the no code segment will outpace the broader industry significantly in growth percentage, as it is expected to exhibit a faster growth rate of 27.6% over the same time period.All anyone can talk about these days is the growth of artificial intelligence and the use of ChatGPT for all sorts of applications, from writing to making assignments, and even writing code. However, while for the general public, using code itself to write code seems to be a novel concept, the fact is that this practice has been around for years. Starting from ChatGPT though, the bot is shown to be able to write simple Java, Python, and React code, alongside also providing conversational feedback receiving capability to admit its mistakes and improve on them. Using code to write code that then writes codes is called Metaprogramming in computer science. This practice has a multi decade history, and the first programming language capable to do so was the programming language Lisp which was introduced in 1958.Story continuesAs far as 2023 goes, there are several trends that will be important this year according to the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT). These include the growing use of robotics in business processes and operations, blockchain technologies, the Internet of Things (IoT), and advanced N3-E semiconductors fabricated by the Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (NYSE:TSM).Today, we'll look at some of the largest software companies in the world with the top picks being Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), Alphabet Inc.

(NYSE: LUV) today will share an overview of the prioritized actions being implemented to strengthen the airline's operational resiliency. The actions will be previewed by Bob Jordan, Southwest's President and Chief Executive Officer, at the J.P. Morgan Industrials Conference in New York and are designed for Customers and Employees to continue benefiting from the airline's 52-year history of providing Safe, reliable, and Customer-friendly Southwest Hospitality.As a result of the initial assessments conducted by Southwest, and the globally-recognized aviation consultancy Oliver Wyman, the airline has developed a three-part Tactical Action Plan to boost operational resiliency in key areas across the Company. The airline's existing five-year Operational Modernization Plan, which began in 2022, is also underway and focuses on operational investments and organizational alignment to support Customers and Employees.""We understand the root causes that led to the holiday disruption, and we're validating our internal review with the third-party assessment. Now, we expect to mitigate the risk of an event of this magnitude ever happening again,"" said Bob Jordan, Southwest's President and Chief Executive Officer. ""Work is well underway implementing action items to prepare for next winter—with some items already completed. I want to thank our Employees and Customers for their patience and grace, and we're resolved to emerge an even stronger airline.""In addition to Winter Storm Elliot, which was more severe than expected, a driver of the disruption was determined to be the volume of cascading and close-in flight cancelations during the storm which overwhelmed Station operations and the airline's Crew Network and hindered established processes and internal tools. While the airline had existing technology and staffing in place to handle many types of irregular operations, the pace and breadth of disruptions during this extreme event strained the ability to create timely operational solutions. The airline will provide additional communication in the coming weeks, including a microsite summarizing key findings and mitigation actions.Story continuesHighlights of the Tactical Action PlanAccelerate Operational Investments: The airline began a five-year Operational Modernization Plan prior to December 2022 with many initiatives already underway to support operational resiliency. Now, ongoing implementation of tools and technology that allow for a greater pace of recovery during extreme events will be prioritized, and the airline is, currently, budgeted to spend more than $1.3 billion on investments, upgrades, and maintenance of information technology systems in 2023. For example, Crew Optimization software has been recently upgraded to address a functional gap that was revealed in December. Crew Scheduling and Customer phone systems also will be upgraded for better surge protection and efficiency during periods of high call volumes.Winter Operations: Challenges with infrastructure, winter equipment, and winter weather preparedness have been, or will be, addressed through various actions, including purchasing additional deicing trucks; securing additional deicing pads and deicing fluid capacity at key network locations; and purchasing more engine covers and engine heaters for cold weather operations. Southwest was the first U.S. airline to hire back to pre-pandemic total staffing by June 2022, and, going forward, the airline will further augment winter staffing levels—for example, when Ground Operations Employees are limited to the amount of time they can work outside in extreme temperatures.

(NYSE:GPN), then you'll have to look at the makeup of its share registry. We can see that institutions own the lion's share in the company with 89% ownership. In other words, the group stands to gain the most (or lose the most) from their investment into the company.And so it follows that institutional investors was the group most impacted after the company's market cap fell to US$26b last week after a 11% drop in the share price. Needless to say, the recent loss which further adds to the one-year loss to shareholders of 21% might not go down well especially with this category of shareholders. Also referred to as ""smart money"", institutions have a lot of sway over how a stock's price moves. Hence, if weakness in Global Payments' share price continues, institutional investors may feel compelled to sell the stock, which might not be ideal for individual investors.Let's delve deeper into each type of owner of Global Payments, beginning with the chart below. Check out our latest analysis for Global Payments ownership-breakdownWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Global Payments?Institutions typically measure themselves against a benchmark when reporting to their own investors, so they often become more enthusiastic about a stock once it's included in a major index. We would expect most companies to have some institutions on the register, especially if they are growing.We can see that Global Payments does have institutional investors; and they hold a good portion of the company's stock. This can indicate that the company has a certain degree of credibility in the investment community. However, it is best to be wary of relying on the supposed validation that comes with institutional investors. They too, get it wrong sometimes. If multiple institutions change their view on a stock at the same time, you could see the share price drop fast. It's therefore worth looking at Global Payments' earnings history below. Of course, the future is what really matters.Story continuesearnings-and-revenue-growthInstitutional investors own over 50% of the company, so together than can probably strongly influence board decisions. Global Payments is not owned by hedge funds. The company's largest shareholder is The Vanguard Group, Inc., with ownership of 10%. BlackRock, Inc. is the second largest shareholder owning 7.6% of common stock, and Wellington Management Group LLP holds about 5.7% of the company stock.Looking at the shareholder registry, we can see that 51% of the ownership is controlled by the top 16 shareholders, meaning that no single shareholder has a majority interest in the ownership.While it makes sense to study institutional ownership data for a company, it also makes sense to study analyst sentiments to know which way the wind is blowing. There are a reasonable number of analysts covering the stock, so it might be useful to find out their aggregate view on the future.Insider Ownership Of Global PaymentsThe definition of company insiders can be subjective and does vary between jurisdictions. Our data reflects individual insiders, capturing board members at the very least. Company management run the business, but the CEO will answer to the board, even if he or she is a member of it.I generally consider insider ownership to be a good thing. However, on some occasions it makes it more difficult for other shareholders to hold the board accountable for decisions.Our most recent data indicates that insiders own less than 1% of Global Payments Inc.. Being so large, we would not expect insiders to own a large proportion of the stock. Collectively, they own US$242m of stock. In this sort of situation, it can be more interesting to  see if those insiders have been buying or selling. General Public OwnershipThe general public-- including retail investors -- own 10% stake in the company, and hence can't easily be ignored. While this group can't necessarily call the shots, it can certainly have a real influence on how the company is run.Next Steps:It's always worth thinking about the different groups who own shares in a company. But to understand Global Payments better, we need to consider many other factors. Take risks for example - Global Payments has   4 warning signs  (and 1 which can't be ignored)  we think you should know about.But ultimately  it is the future, not the past, that will determine how well the owners of this business will do. Therefore we think it advisable to take a look at this free report showing whether analysts are predicting a brighter future.NB: Figures in this article are calculated using data from the last twelve months, which refer to the 12-month period ending on the last date of the month the financial statement is dated.

But that doesn't undermine the rather lovely longer-term return, if you measure over the last three years. In three years the stock price has launched 239% higher: a great result. To some, the recent share price pullback wouldn't be surprising after such a good run. The fundamental business performance will ultimately dictate whether the top is in, or if this is a stellar buying opportunity.In light of the stock dropping 12% in the past week, we want to investigate the longer term story, and see if fundamentals have been the driver of the company's positive three-year return. View our latest analysis for Schlumberger While the efficient markets hypothesis continues to be taught by some, it has been proven that markets are over-reactive dynamic systems, and investors are not always rational. One way to examine how market sentiment has changed over time is to look at the interaction between a company's share price and its earnings per share (EPS).Schlumberger became profitable within the last three years. That kind of transition can be an inflection point that justifies a strong share price gain, just as we have seen here.The company's earnings per share (over time) is depicted in the image below (click to see the exact numbers).earnings-per-share-growthWe know that Schlumberger has improved its bottom line over the last three years, but what does the future have in store? It might be well worthwhile taking a look at our free report on how its financial position has changed over time.What About Dividends?As well as measuring the share price return, investors should also consider the total shareholder return (TSR). The TSR is a return calculation that accounts for the value of cash dividends (assuming that any dividend received was reinvested) and the calculated value of any discounted capital raisings and spin-offs. Arguably, the TSR gives a more comprehensive picture of the return generated by a stock. In the case of Schlumberger, it has a TSR of 259% for the last 3 years. That exceeds its share price return that we previously mentioned. And there's no prize for guessing that the dividend payments largely explain the divergence!Story continuesA Different PerspectiveWe're pleased to report that Schlumberger shareholders have received a total shareholder return of 19% over one year. That's including the dividend. Notably the five-year annualised TSR loss of 2% per year compares very unfavourably with the recent share price performance. This makes us a little wary, but the business might have turned around its fortunes. I find it very interesting to look at share price over the long term as a proxy for business performance. But to truly gain insight, we need to consider other information, too. Take risks, for example - Schlumberger has   3 warning signs   we think you should be aware of.Of course Schlumberger may not be the best stock to buy.

It is the first rapid antigen test for detecting COVID-19 to be awarded FDA market clearance. It is intended for prescription use only and can be used in point-of-care settings.The latest regulatory approval is likely to significantly boost QuidelOrtho’s Point of Care business unit.A Few Words About the TestThe Sofia 2 SARS Antigen+ FIA is a lateral flow immunofluorescent assay used with the Sofia 2 fluorescent immunoassay analyzer. This is intended for the qualitative detection of the nucleocapsid protein antigen of SARS-CoV-2 in direct anterior nasal swab specimens from symptomatic individuals when tested within six days of symptom onset.The Sofia 2 SARS Antigen+ FIA is intended for use by trained clinical laboratory personnel and individuals trained in point-of-care settings and capable of performing tests using Sofia 2 instruments.The enhanced Sofia 2 SARS Antigen+ FIA Test kit includes other upgraded features, such as prefilled reagent vials, among others. The Sofia 2 instrument also offers two distinct workflows — WALK AWAY Mode and READ NOW Mode.Significance of the ApprovalThe Sofia 2 analyzer utilizes QuidelOrtho’s proprietary fluorescent chemistry design and other techniques to provide an accurate, objective and automated result in 10 minutes. This is a marked reduction (33%) from the breakthrough 15-minute processing time achieved in the first iterations of the Sofia SARS Antigen FIA assay. The Sofia 2 system is also connected to QuidelOrtho’s data management system — Virena — which provides aggregated, de-identified testing and surveillance data in near-real time.Per management, the De Novo authorization has enabled Sofia to become the predicate device upon which subsequent devices of the same type and intended use will be compared. This designation is expected to ensure that QuidelOrtho’s rapid testing technologies continue to actively prevent COVID-19 infections as it transitions to its endemic stage.Story continuesIndustry ProspectsPer a report by Precedence Research, the global diagnostic testing market was valued at $165.58 billion in 2021 and is anticipated to exceed $348.75 billion by 2030 at a CAGR of approximately 8.6%.

(HOLX) a Buy Now?",Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/trending-stock-hologic-inc-holx-130001186.html,1678712401,STORY,['HOLX'],"[Hologic (HOLX) has been one of the most searched-for stocks on Zacks.com lately. So, you might want to look at some of the facts that could shape the stock's performance in the near term.Shares of this medical device maker have returned -5.1% over the past month versus the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's -5.4% change. The Zacks Medical - Instruments industry, to which Hologic belongs, has lost 4.9% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?Although media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.Earnings Estimate RevisionsHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.Our analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.For the current quarter, Hologic is expected to post earnings of $0.88 per share, indicating a change of -57.5% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed +0.3% over the last 30 days.For the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $3.74 points to a change of -37.9% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has changed -0.2%.Story continuesFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $4 indicates a change of +7.1% from what Hologic is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed +0.3%.Having a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, Hologic is rated Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPS12-month consensus EPS estimate for HOLX _12MonthEPSChartUrlRevenue Growth ForecastEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.In the case of Hologic, the consensus sales estimate of $967.05 million for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of -32.6%. The $3.97 billion and $4.13 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of -18.4% and +4%, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryHologic reported revenues of $1.07 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -27%. EPS of $1.07 for the same period compares with $2.17 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $980.98 million, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +9.5%. The EPS surprise was +18.89%.The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.ValuationNo investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.While comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.The Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.Hologic is graded B on this front, indicating that it is trading at a discount to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.Bottom LineThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Hologic. However, its Zacks Rank #2 does suggest that it may outperform the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Netflix’s -9% with both underperforming the S&amp;P 500’s -2%. Disney stock is up +6% year to date to top Netflix and the benchmark’s virtually flat performances.  Furthermore, after a volatile 2022, Disney and Netflix are two stocks that many believe could have substantial rebounds this year as inflationary concerns start to subside. To that note, Disney and Netflix stock sill trade 36% and 26% from their 52-week highs respectively.Disney may especially stand out to investors in terms of recovery hopes. Disney stock is still down -28% over the last year to largely underperform Netflix’s -11% and the broader indexes.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchValuationMonitoring the valuation of Disney and Netflix will continue to be important in gauging their upside and rebound prospects.In this regard, both stocks trade attractively relative to their past from a price-to-earnings perspective. Netflix especially stands out trading at $294 and 26.1X forward earnings which is well below its decade high of 513.4X and a 75% discount to the median of 107.3X.In comparison, Disney trades at $92 per share and 23.5X forward earnings, considerably beneath its own decade high of 134.4X and closer to the median of 19.9X.Even better, the price to sales that investors are paying for both companies is far more reasonable. Disney’s price to sales of 1.8X is 63% below its decade high of 5.1X and offers a 35% discount to the median of 2.9X. Looking at Netflix, its P/S multiple of 3.8X is 65% below its decade-high of 11X and 36% beneath the median of 6X.Story continuesZacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchGrowth &amp; SubscribersWith the valuation of both companies becoming more attractive, investors will want to see Disney and Netflix's growth continue.Following their most recent fiscal quarters, Netflix stood at 230.75 million subscribers which topped Disney Plus at 161.8 million subscribers. Netflix subscribers grew by 7.66 million during the quarter while Disney lost 2.4 million users its first reported decline since launching in 2019.Impressively, when including its ESPN+ and Hulu services, Disney’s total subscribers have surpassed Netflix at 234.7 million. Disney earnings are expected to rise 13% in fiscal 2023 and soar another 36% in FY24 at $5.42 per share. Sales are forecasted to be up 9% this year and rise another 7% in FY24 to $96.12 billion.As for Netflix, earnings are projected to be up 12% this year and climb another 28% in FY24 at $14.29 per share. Sales are forecasted to rise 8% in FY23 and jump another 11% in FY24 to $38.12 billion.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchTakeawayDisney and Netflix stock both land a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) at the moment. For now, most of the volatility surrounding last week’s selloff is starting to be contained within the financial sector.There may still be better buying opportunities ahead for Disney and Netflix stock but holding on to shares at their current levels could be rewarding as they appear to be resuming growth following a rough 2022 for most companies.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

90,b0591cde-a356-3edf-89fe-b92b01709256,TJX,2023-03-14,15 Most Valuable Clothing Companies in the World,Insider Monkey,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/15-most-valuable-clothing-companies-140356433.html,1678716236,STORY,"['AEO', 'GPS', 'HMRZF', 'TPR', 'TJX', 'LULU', 'RL']","[In this article, we discuss the 15 most valuable clothing companies in the world. If you want to read about some more clothing companies, go directly to the 5 Most Valuable Clothing Companies in the World.After experiencing 18 months of robust growth (early 2021 through mid-2022), the clothing industry faces a challenging climate once again. Hyperinflation and depressed customer sentiments had already resulted in declining growth rates in the second half of 2022, and a slowdown is likely to persist this year. The Russia-Ukraine war has disrupted the chances of global economic recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic, at least in the short term. This has led to economic sanctions on multiple countries, a steep rise in commodity prices, and supply chain disruptions, thus causing inflation across goods and services.According to a survey conducted by McKinsey, a global management consulting firm, clothing companies are anticipating a spike in their costs on account of inflation, with 97 % of surveyed executives forecasting that their cost of goods sold and selling, general and administrative (SG&amp;A) expenses will rise in 2023. Cotton and cashmere prices, for example, have increased 45% and 30% year-on-year, respectively. The fashion market, excluding the luxury sector, will struggle to deliver significant growth in 2023. McKinsey's analysis of fashion forecasts projects relatively slow sales growth of between –2% and +3%, weighed down by a contraction in the European market. China and the United States, on the other hand, are expected to fare better.The clothing industry, also known as the apparel market, includes clothing ranging from sportswear to business wear to daily wear to luxury products. The pandemic has acted as a massive restraint on the apparel manufacturing market in 2022 as supply chains were disrupted due to trade restrictions and consumption declined due to lockdowns imposed by governments globally. Despite this, the global clothing market has endured relatively better compared to other industries, growing from $610.12 billion in 2022 to $652.94 billion in 2023. In terms of future outlooks, the market is further expected to grow to $830.69 billion in 2027 at a CAGR of 6.2%. In global comparison, the United States led the charge with $343.70 billion in revenues. With intense competitive rivalry in the industry, leading companies have continued to provide product differentiation with a dynamic approach to meet the changing trends. Additionally, the increasing demand for online shopping is expected to help the apparel manufacturing market grow.Story continues15 Most Valuable Clothing Companies in the WorldPhoto by Keagan Henman on UnsplashOur MethodologyTo come up with the 15 most valuable clothing companies in the world, we used stock screeners to identify the biggest clothing companies by market capitalization.

For more such retirement mistakes, go to 5 Biggest Retirement Mistakes You Will Regret Forever.Retirement is an inevitable stage in every individual's life. After working for several years, people eventually reach a point where they want to retire and enjoy the fruits of their labor. However, retirement can be a daunting task if not planned correctly. In this article, we will discuss the importance of retirement planning, its economic impact, and the social costs of poor retirement planning.The Importance Of Retirement PlanningRetirement planning is of utmost importance due to the uncertain economic conditions and the increasing costs of living in the future. Although planning for an unknown future may seem intimidating, it is important to start planning early and develop a roadmap that can be modified over time.The first step in retirement planning is to define retirement goals. It is important to contemplate what one wants to achieve during retirement years and how life would look at that stage. Noting down those goals and aspirations can help guide planning efforts.Another important step is to estimate future expenses, keeping in mind that inflation and rising costs of living can significantly impact those expenses in the long term. According to CNBC, the average inflation rate in the U.S. over the past century (1913-2013) was 3.22%. Thus, planning for higher prices in the future is critical, especially given the rising costs of living.Financial experts have suggested that individuals should aim to save $2 million for their retirement. This figure has increased from the previous recommendation of $1 million due to changes in the cost of living and demographic trends. Others advise that individuals should save between 80% to 90% of their annual pre-retirement income or at least 12 times their pre-retirement salary to ensure a comfortable retirement.Story continuesPreparing for retirement can be challenging, especially when considering life beyond the age of 70, and this overwhelming thought often leads to inaction. However, developing a flexible plan can help navigate the uncertainties of the future and ensure a comfortable retirement.Why It's Never Too Early To Start Planning For RetirementRetirement planning ensures that one has enough funds to maintain their standard of living during retirement. It is crucial to start planning for retirement as early as possible to take advantage of compound interest and secure a better retirement lifestyle.The need for retirement planning to ensure financial security is more than ever now due to the reduction or loss of guaranteed income streams.For example, according to research from Journal of Family and Economic Issues, social security benefits were a significant source of income for the 48 million Americans who received retirement benefits in 2020, representing 33% of their income.However, with 78 million Americans projected to be over age 65 by 2035, and the depletion of the Social Security reserve fund, benefits are expected to be reduced. Defined contribution (DC) plans have become more prevalent than defined benefit (DB) plans, with only 25% of Americans having access to a DB plan in 2020. Additionally, less than half of those DB plans were covered by the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation, while 60% of Americans have access to a DC plan.The Impact Of Retirement PlanningRetirement planning positively impacts the economy due to individuals saving and investing, thereby stimulating economic growth. It also reduces the burden on social security and government-funded programs by enabling individuals to support themselves during retirement and avoiding poverty. Savings increase the capital available for production, contributing to economic growth. Inadequate retirement planning can cause significant social costs. It can lead to a lower quality of life for retirees, increased stress, and health issues. Moreover, retirees who haven't planned for retirement may require support from society, creating an additional burden on government-funded programs. This could increase the risk of Social Security and Medicare insolvency, further exacerbating the issue.Reuters notes that social security and Medicare insolvency can have massive repercussions for retirees in addition to the economy, and according to NIH, social security payroll tax collections have not been enough to cover annual costs since 2010. Once Trust Fund assets are depleted, payroll tax revenue will only cover approximately 75% of scheduled benefits starting around 2036.However, corporate retirement benefits can be helpful to compensate for any potential drawbacks with social security. In this respect, companies like ConocoPhillips (NYSE:COP), The Boeing Company (NYSE:BA) and Amgen Inc. (NASDAQ:AMGN) are among the most noteworthy corporations that have top-notch retirement plans to offer their employees.The Boeing Company (NYSE:BA) has a 401(k) plan for its non-unionized employees, as opposed to a pension plan, with The Boeing Company (NYSE:BA) matching 75% contributions on the first 8% of base pay contributions from its employees.On the other hand, ConocoPhillips (NYSE:COP) pays a 6% match after its employees invest 1% of their income in pay periods. Additionally, ConocoPhillips (NYSE:COP) also offers substitute match of between 0 and 6% based on employees’ ages and the company’s profitability.Lastly, Amgen Inc. (NASDAQ:AMGN) provides retirement benefits to its employees through its retirement fund, in which the company makes an upfront contribution of 5%, regardless of whether the employees have made the contribution to the plan or not.

The objective of our research was to identify common themes and patterns among multiple sources to establish a consensus on retirement mistakes. We then ranked these mistakes based on their severity.Below are the 15 biggest retirement mistakes you will regret forever.15. Retiring PrematurelyRetiring early may seem appealing, but it could be one of the biggest retirement mistakes you'd regret forever. It's important to consider the potential drawbacks. If you retire earlier than planned, you risk depleting your savings and being forced to find ways to earn extra income during retirement instead of pursuing your interests. Many retirement plans, such as 401(k)s and individual retirement accounts, may impose penalties for early withdrawals before the age of 59 1/2. If you retire too soon, you may not be able to access your savings when you need them without incurring fees.14. Retiring Too LateIt is possible to experience regret if one has dedicated their entire life towards preparing for retirement and then delays enjoying it for too long. For those who have planned accordingly and are financially able to retire, it is essential to consider the potential disadvantages of delaying retirement and remaining in the workforce. It is easier to make the transition while still in good health, and after years of hard work, it is reasonable to desire the freedom and leisure that retirement offers.13. Prioritizing Children Over Retirement NeedsIt may not be prudent to make financial sacrifices to support your adult children, especially if you are approaching retirement age while they are still in the early stages of their careers. Your children have a longer time horizon to recover from financial setbacks compared to your limited time left before retirement.According to Martin, a director at BKD Wealth Advisors, many people nearing retirement have had to endure financial hardships in their younger years, such as living in cramped apartments with several roommates and subsisting on low-cost meals. However, some parents struggle with the notion of allowing their children to undergo similar struggles and, as a result, dip into retirement savings to provide financial assistance.12. Disregarding Cognitive DeclineManaging an investment portfolio can become exceedingly challenging with even a mild degree of age-related cognitive decline. MacKenzie, president of Saturn Wealth in Gilbert, recommends preparing a healthcare power of attorney ahead of time to mitigate this risk. According to her, it is advisable to designate someone who can assume control of your account and make sound decisions on your behalf if you are no longer capable of doing so.11. Filing Social Security EarlyAccording to Morgan Stanley, when contemplating social security benefits, it is essential to consider the impact of age on the amount of benefit received. While an individual may apply for benefits at age 62, the resulting benefit amount may be reduced by up to 30% if they have not yet reached the full retirement age (FRA) designated by the Social Security Administration.Additionally, those who opt to receive benefits before reaching FRA and continue working may have their benefits reduced further. For every $2 earned over a specified limit - which stands at $21,240 in 2023 - the individual's benefit will be reduced by $1. Thus, it may be advantageous to delay the application unless there is an urgent need for funds.For those who can afford to postpone receiving benefits, it is prudent to wait until age 70 to apply. By doing so, they may receive up to 32% more in benefits than if they had applied at FRA, providing greater long-term financial stability during their retirement years.10. Not Considering the Impact of TaxesIt is important for individuals to carefully consider their retirement income and tax implications when making investment decisions. If an individual expects to be in a higher tax bracket during retirement, it may be advantageous to invest in a Roth 401(k) or Roth IRA. These investments require taxes to be paid upfront, but all future withdrawals, including investment earnings, will be tax-free. Alternatively, if an individual expects to be in a lower tax bracket during retirement, a traditional IRA or 401(k) could be a better choice as taxes can be deferred until the time of withdrawal.Additionally, borrowing from a regular 401(k) plan may have tax consequences. Borrowed funds must be repaid with after-tax dollars, and withdrawals during retirement will also be taxed. Therefore, individuals should weigh the potential benefits and drawbacks before making decisions about borrowing from their retirement accounts.9. Entering Retirement with Significant DebtDriving up debt in the years preceding retirement can have significant negative implications for one's savings. It is essential to maintain a healthy emergency fund to avoid the need for last-minute borrowing or dipping into retirement savings. Thus, it is prudent to prioritize paying off debts before retirement to minimize financial obligations and reduce the risk of accumulating interest over time.It is important to note that halting retirement savings to pay off debts may not be the best approach. Experts caution against this strategy and suggest finding a way to balance both objectives simultaneously to maximize long-term financial benefits. This may involve seeking professional advice or exploring various debt repayment options to manage debt while continuing to contribute to retirement savings.8. Ignoring Healthcare ExpensesMorgan Stanley states that in a 2021 survey, conducted by Nationwide Retirement Institute, slightly over 50% of retirees express concerns about not having sufficient funds to cover unplanned medical expenses in retirement. Moreover, two-thirds of retirees are apprehensive about healthcare costs becoming too onerous, while 50% of retirees are only somewhat or not at all confident in their plan to pay for healthcare expenses beyond what medicare covers.These apprehensions are not unwarranted, considering healthcare cost trends. For instance, the average retired couple requires $315,000 in current dollars to cover medical expenses in retirement, excluding long-term care. Additionally, today's 65-year-olds have a 70% likelihood of requiring extended care at some point in their lives, and one in five 65-year-olds will need long-term care for more than five years. It is critical to consider the potential impact of long-term care costs on asset erosion.7. Overlooking InflationNot adjusting for inflation can be one of the biggest retirement mistakes you will regret forever. According to CNBC, financial planner Scott Stratton has expressed concern over inflation as a significant risk factor, especially as retirement periods become more prolonged. Stratton notes that even with a modest inflation rate of 3%, the cost of living would double every 24 years, and some expenses such as healthcare are growing at rates exceeding 3%. In response to this risk, Certified Financial Planner (CFP) Tim Estes recommends investing in equities as a means to counteract inflation. He emphasizes the importance of having some investments in the stock market to generate returns above the inflation rate. Estes suggests that a moderately invested portfolio with returns ranging from 6% to 7% can effectively keep up with inflation, even after accounting for withdrawals.6. Draining Retirement Accounts EarlyForbes notes that retirement plan accounts serve the purpose of catering to an individual's financial needs during their later years. To ensure maximum benefit, one should refrain from withdrawing funds from their retirement accounts before attaining the age of 59½, as a 10% penalty is applicable on the withdrawn amount. Additionally, income tax on the distribution must also be paid. For instance, a $10,000 early withdrawal from a retirement account by an individual in the 22% tax bracket would result in $3,200 in taxes and penalties. Therefore, it is advisable to explore alternative financing methods to avoid incurring such high costs.Click to continue reading and see the 5 Biggest Retirement Mistakes You Will Regret Forever.Suggested Articles:15 Biggest Retirement Communities in the World25 Best Countries For A Comfortable RetirementEarly Retirement Portfolio: 15 Stocks to Live Off Dividends RevisitedDisclosure: none. 15 Biggest Retirement Mistake You Will Regret Forever is originally published on Insider Monkey.]"

96,58baec14-2d34-3740-a38e-8f599e94393b,M,2023-03-14,Mongolia looks to copper to transform stagnant economy,AP Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/mongolia-looks-copper-transform-stagnant-105945353.html,1678791585,STORY,['M'],"[BEIJING (AP) — Mongolia plans to channel revenue from rising copper exports into an economic development fund as part of changes to reap more benefit from its mineral riches and root out corruption, the North Asian nation’s prime minister said in an interview Tuesday following the opening of a major expansion of its biggest mine.Luvsannamsrain Oyun-Erdene attended a ceremony 1,300 meters (4,300 feet) below ground to mark the start of underground production Monday at the Oyu Tolgoi mine in the Gobi Desert in southern Mongolia. He was joined by executives of Rio Tinto, the Australian mining giant that owns a 66% stake in the mine. The government owns the rest.The multibillion-dollar expansion of Oyu Tolgoi is the latest effort to generate prosperity from Mongolia's copper, coal, gold and other minerals following three decades of complaints about economic malaise and corruption.Oyun-Erdene, who took office in 2021, represents a younger generation following leaders who grew up under the Soviet-allied former communist government. At 42, the politician with the burly build of an American college football player has a master’s degree in public policy from the Harvard Kennedy School and experience working abroad.“We are working hard to eliminate the old culture and introduce a new mindset,” the prime minister said by video link from Ulan Bator, the Mongolian capital.Mongolia gets more than 90% of its export revenue from minerals and is benefiting from the surge in global sales of electric cars that use more than a mile (1,500 meters) of copper wire in their motors.Oyun-Erdene said his government plans to invest copper revenue in public health, education and developing technology, tourism and other new industries. He said his government will propose a law to create a sovereign wealth fund during the parliament session that begins Wednesday.“We do believe this will be a historic moment for the livelihoods and standard of living of the people of Mongolia,” Oyun-Erdene said. He said his government wants to make “the wealth and natural resources of Mongolia beneficial and equally distributed to all the people of Mongolia.”Story continuesMongolia’s economic growth is forecast by the International Monetary Fund to accelerate this year to 5% from last year’s 2.5%. But households have struggled with inflation that spiked to 14% last year. Economic output per person is about $4,500, barely one-third of neighboring China’s level.Government plans call for more than doubling average economic output for Mongolia’s 3.2 million people to $10,000 by 2030.The planned fund includes a pool of money for housing, education and health, a separate fund for development projects and a “stabilization fund” to cushion against changes in commodity prices, according to Oyun. That is similar to sovereign wealth funds operated by Chile, another big copper exporter, and oil producers to invest natural resource revenues.Other planned investments to “enhance our economic independence” include two hydroelectric power plants to reduce Mongolia’s need for electricity from its giant neighbors, China and Russia, according to Oyun-Erdene.To extract more value from its copper, Mongolia announced an agreement this week with Rio Tinto to look at building a smelter.Oyu Tolgoi, about 550 kilometers (350 miles) south of Ulan Bator, started digging copper from an open pit in 2012 before developing the underground mine that its operators say is more valuable. The mine, with a workforce of 20,000, says it has paid $4 billion in taxes and other fees to the government.Production is forecast to rise to 500,000 tons per year, or enough to equip 6 million electric vehicles. Its operators say that would make Oyu Tolgoi the world’s fourth-largest copper mine.“People of Mongolia will benefit greatly from this project,” Oyun-Erdene, wearing a green helmet with a mining lamp, said Monday at a ceremony with Rio Tinto CEO Jakob Stausholm.The mine faces complaints it uses too much scarce water in its desert setting and has displaced traditional nomadic herders. Activists say Rio Tinto and the government failed to carry out a 2017 agreement to compensate them.The mine’s operator responds that it recycles most of its water and has paid the provincial government some $40.5 million for what it draws from local sources. The company says it has repaired herder wells and installed solar panels to power pumps at 40 of them.“We are having talks with Oyu Tolgoi on how to improve the environment and especially how we can address the issue of environmental degradation,” Oyun-Erdene said.He acknowledged complaints about corruption in the government-dominated mining industry, saying his administration has declared this an “anti-corruption year” and is carrying out a five-part plan based on advice from Transparency International, a global anti-graft watchdog.Mongolia ranked 116th among countries last year in Transparency International’s “corruption perceptions index,” based on a survey of businesspeople and experts. That was down from No. 94 in 2012.In December, thousands of people protested in freezing weather in Ulan Bator after Oyun-Erdene's government announced an investigation into officials accused of profiting from the improper diversion of coal exports in 2013-19.The government aims to make mining more transparent and to reduce political influence by turning state-owned enterprises into companies with publicly traded shares. Oyun-Erdene said.“Some parliament members are involved in mining and own companies. This is a real challenge,” Oyun-Erdene said. “We have to make the private interests of parliament members and public officials separate from the public interests of Mongolia.”]"

This weighed heavily on the dollar and short-term Treasury yields, which in turn greatly benefited gold.Spot gold was flat at $1,913.76 an ounce, while gold futures rose 0.1% to $1,918.75 an ounce by 20:54 ET (00:54 GMT). Both instruments were trading close to their highest levels for the year.Focus is now on consumer price index inflation data for February, due later in the day. The index is expected to have eased slightly from the prior month, although core inflation is expected to remain the same.The Fed had warned last week that sticky inflation could spur more aggressive tightening measures by the bank. But in the face of a potential banking crisis, the central bank’s path remains uncertain.Fed Fund futures prices now show that markets have completely ruled out the possibility of a 50 basis point hike next week, with a majority of traders now expecting the bank to raise rates by a smaller 25 basis points. But a portion of traders also expect the Fed to hold rates at 4.50% to 4.75%.High interest rates had battered gold through 2022, as rising yields pushed up the cost of holding non-yielding assets. But a reversal, or potential easing in the Fed’s hawkish stance, could benefit the yellow metal.Story continuesOther precious metals retreated on Tuesday after logging sharp gains over the past four sessions. Silver futures fell 0.3%, while platinum futures shed 0.5%.Among industrial metals, copper prices were muted as markets weighed less pressure from the dollar against the growing prospect of an economic slowdown this year.Copper futures were flat at $4.0385 a pound, after moving little in recent sessions.Related ArticlesGold prices hold above $1,900 as CPI data loomsOil prices rattled by U.S. banking crisis, CPI data awaitedOil prices edge lower as SVB collapse spooks financial markets]"

(NYSE:TSN), it is important to understand the ownership structure of the business. With 68% stake, institutions possess the maximum shares in the company. Put another way, the group faces the maximum upside potential (or downside risk).And so it follows that institutional investors was the group most impacted after the company's market cap fell to US$20b last week after a 3.0% drop in the share price. Needless to say, the recent loss which further adds to the one-year loss to shareholders of 32% might not go down well especially with this category of shareholders. Institutions or ""liquidity providers"" control large sums of money and therefore, these types of investors usually have a lot of influence over stock price movements. As a result, if the decline continues, institutional investors may be pressured to sell Tyson Foods which might hurt individual investors.In the chart below, we zoom in on the different ownership groups of Tyson Foods. View our latest analysis for Tyson Foods ownership-breakdownWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Tyson Foods?Many institutions measure their performance against an index that approximates the local market. So they usually pay more attention to companies that are included in major indices.We can see that Tyson Foods does have institutional investors; and they hold a good portion of the company's stock. This can indicate that the company has a certain degree of credibility in the investment community. However, it is best to be wary of relying on the supposed validation that comes with institutional investors. They too, get it wrong sometimes. If multiple institutions change their view on a stock at the same time, you could see the share price drop fast. It's therefore worth looking at Tyson Foods' earnings history below. Of course, the future is what really matters.Story continuesearnings-and-revenue-growthInvestors should note that institutions actually own more than half the company, so they can collectively wield significant power. Tyson Foods is not owned by hedge funds. The company's largest shareholder is Tyson Limited Partnership, with ownership of 20%. With 11% and 7.1% of the shares outstanding respectively, The Vanguard Group, Inc. and BlackRock, Inc. are the second and third largest shareholders.On further inspection, we found that more than half the company's shares are owned by the top 9 shareholders, suggesting that the interests of the larger shareholders are balanced out to an extent by the smaller ones.While studying institutional ownership for a company can add value to your research, it is also a good practice to research analyst recommendations to get a deeper understand of a stock's expected performance. There are plenty of analysts covering the stock, so it might be worth seeing what they are forecasting, too.Insider Ownership Of Tyson FoodsThe definition of an insider can differ slightly between different countries, but members of the board of directors always count. Company management run the business, but the CEO will answer to the board, even if he or she is a member of it.Most consider insider ownership a positive because it can indicate the board is well aligned with other shareholders. However, on some occasions too much power is concentrated within this group.We can see that insiders own shares in Tyson Foods, Inc.. Insiders own US$225m worth of shares (at current prices). we sometimes take an interest in  whether they have been buying or selling. General Public OwnershipThe general public, who are usually individual investors, hold a 11% stake in Tyson Foods. While this group can't necessarily call the shots, it can certainly have a real influence on how the company is run.Private Company OwnershipOur data indicates that Private Companies hold 20%, of the company's shares. It's hard to draw any conclusions from this fact alone, so its worth looking into who owns those private companies. Sometimes insiders or other related parties have an interest in shares in a public company through a separate private company.Next Steps:I find it very interesting to look at who exactly owns a company. But to truly gain insight, we need to consider other information, too. Consider risks, for instance. Every company has them, and we've spotted   2 warning signs for Tyson Foods   you should know about.Ultimately the future is most important.

He was joined by executives of Rio Tinto, the Australian mining giant that owns a 66% stake in the mine. The government owns the rest.The multibillion-dollar expansion of Oyu Tolgoi is the latest effort to generate prosperity from Mongolia's copper, coal, gold and other minerals following three decades of complaints about economic malaise and corruption.Oyun-Erdene, who took office in 2021, represents a younger generation following leaders who grew up under the Soviet-allied former communist government. At 42, the politician with the burly build of an American college football player has a master’s degree in public policy from the Harvard Kennedy School and experience working abroad.“We are working hard to eliminate the old culture and introduce a new mindset,” the prime minister said by video link from Ulan Bator, the Mongolian capital.Mongolia gets more than 90% of its export revenue from minerals and is benefiting from the surge in global sales of electric cars that use more than a mile (1,500 meters) of copper wire in their motors.Oyun-Erdene said his government plans to invest copper revenue in public health, education and developing technology, tourism and other new industries. He said his government will propose a law to create a sovereign wealth fund during the parliament session that begins Wednesday.“We do believe this will be a historic moment for the livelihoods and standard of living of the people of Mongolia,” Oyun-Erdene said. He said his government wants to make “the wealth and natural resources of Mongolia beneficial and equally distributed to all the people of Mongolia.”Story continuesMongolia’s economic growth is forecast by the International Monetary Fund to accelerate this year to 5% from last year’s 2.5%. But households have struggled with inflation that spiked to 14% last year. Economic output per person is about $4,500, barely one-third of neighboring China’s level.Government plans call for more than doubling average economic output for Mongolia’s 3.2 million people to $10,000 by 2030.The planned fund includes a pool of money for housing, education and health, a separate fund for development projects and a “stabilization fund” to cushion against changes in commodity prices, according to Oyun. That is similar to sovereign wealth funds operated by Chile, another big copper exporter, and oil producers to invest natural resource revenues.Other planned investments to “enhance our economic independence” include two hydroelectric power plants to reduce Mongolia’s need for electricity from its giant neighbors, China and Russia, according to Oyun-Erdene.To extract more value from its copper, Mongolia announced an agreement this week with Rio Tinto to look at building a smelter.Oyu Tolgoi, about 550 kilometers (350 miles) south of Ulan Bator, started digging copper from an open pit in 2012 before developing the underground mine that its operators say is more valuable. The mine, with a workforce of 20,000, says it has paid $4 billion in taxes and other fees to the government.Production is forecast to rise to 500,000 tons per year, or enough to equip 6 million electric vehicles. Its operators say that would make Oyu Tolgoi the world’s fourth-largest copper mine.“People of Mongolia will benefit greatly from this project,” Oyun-Erdene, wearing a green helmet with a mining lamp, said Monday at a ceremony with Rio Tinto CEO Jakob Stausholm.The mine faces complaints it uses too much scarce water in its desert setting and has displaced traditional nomadic herders. Activists say Rio Tinto and the government failed to carry out a 2017 agreement to compensate them.The mine’s operator responds that it recycles most of its water and has paid the provincial government some $40.5 million for what it draws from local sources. The company says it has repaired herder wells and installed solar panels to power pumps at 40 of them.“We are having talks with Oyu Tolgoi on how to improve the environment and especially how we can address the issue of environmental degradation,” Oyun-Erdene said.He acknowledged complaints about corruption in the government-dominated mining industry, saying his administration has declared this an “anti-corruption year” and is carrying out a five-part plan based on advice from Transparency International, a global anti-graft watchdog.Mongolia ranked 116th among countries last year in Transparency International’s “corruption perceptions index,” based on a survey of businesspeople and experts. That was down from No. 94 in 2012.In December, thousands of people protested in freezing weather in Ulan Bator after Oyun-Erdene's government announced an investigation into officials accused of profiting from the improper diversion of coal exports in 2013-19.The government aims to make mining more transparent and to reduce political influence by turning state-owned enterprises into companies with publicly traded shares. Oyun-Erdene said.“Some parliament members are involved in mining and own companies. This is a real challenge,” Oyun-Erdene said. “We have to make the private interests of parliament members and public officials separate from the public interests of Mongolia.”]"

This weighed heavily on the dollar and short-term Treasury yields, which in turn greatly benefited gold.Spot gold was flat at $1,913.76 an ounce, while gold futures rose 0.1% to $1,918.75 an ounce by 20:54 ET (00:54 GMT). Both instruments were trading close to their highest levels for the year.Focus is now on consumer price index inflation data for February, due later in the day. The index is expected to have eased slightly from the prior month, although core inflation is expected to remain the same.The Fed had warned last week that sticky inflation could spur more aggressive tightening measures by the bank. But in the face of a potential banking crisis, the central bank’s path remains uncertain.Fed Fund futures prices now show that markets have completely ruled out the possibility of a 50 basis point hike next week, with a majority of traders now expecting the bank to raise rates by a smaller 25 basis points. But a portion of traders also expect the Fed to hold rates at 4.50% to 4.75%.High interest rates had battered gold through 2022, as rising yields pushed up the cost of holding non-yielding assets. But a reversal, or potential easing in the Fed’s hawkish stance, could benefit the yellow metal.Story continuesOther precious metals retreated on Tuesday after logging sharp gains over the past four sessions. Silver futures fell 0.3%, while platinum futures shed 0.5%.Among industrial metals, copper prices were muted as markets weighed less pressure from the dollar against the growing prospect of an economic slowdown this year.Copper futures were flat at $4.0385 a pound, after moving little in recent sessions.Related ArticlesGold prices hold above $1,900 as CPI data loomsOil prices rattled by U.S. banking crisis, CPI data awaitedOil prices edge lower as SVB collapse spooks financial markets]"

Secure your seat todayWhat a difference a year makes. On March 9, 2022, U.S. President Joe Biden’s office released its executive order on digital assets, marking the first official sign of a comprehensive approach to the regulation of the crypto ecosystem. At the time I and many others saw this as a very big deal, not least because of the strong signal that crypto had “arrived.” It was now significant enough to warrant attention from the leader of the world’s largest economy, and the surprisingly supportive tone of the document surely meant that a constructive regulatory approach was brewing. How wrong I was.A year later, the supportive tone has pretty much disappeared. The comprehensive approach we hoped for turned out to be more of a threat than we anticipated, and the focus is now on erecting barriers rather than building a guiding framework. What happened in the interim?Noelle Acheson is the former head of research at CoinDesk and Genesis Trading. This article is excerpted from her Crypto Is Macro Now newsletter, which focuses on the overlap between the shifting crypto and macro landscapes. These opinions are hers, and nothing she writes should be taken as investment advice.Part of that answer is unfortunately obvious. The ball of fraud-fueled fire that was the collapse of the FTX crypto exchange in November was a spectacular embarrassment to not only crypto businesses that had confided in then-CEO Sam Bankman-Fried and his team. It was also an embarrassment to the politicians who had sat down with him, had posed for the photo-op and had entertained his ideas about crypto regulation. With a few brave exceptions, politicians understandably closed ranks and scrambled to distance themselves from anything to do with crypto risks.But the shift is more complex than it might seem. Even before the FTX revelations, the tone from the Biden administration was more antagonistic. Absent from the executive order were calls for a clampdown; it was more about requesting investigation and reports, more about gathering information and ideas.Story continuesIn September, the White House published an update, which mentioned the implosion of the Terra ecosystem in the first paragraph. Further down, the update stressed the loss of value in the market, how sellers “commonly” mislead consumers and how noncompliance with existing laws is still “widespread.” Already this was sounding very different.The update also set out some White House recommendations, the first of which was that the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) “aggressively pursue investigations and enforcement actions against unlawful practices in the digital assets space.”The crypto fallout presented Washington, D.C., with a problem it could show the world it was doing something about.The second recommendation was that the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) and Federal Trade Commission (FTC) “redouble their efforts to monitor consumer complaints and to enforce against unfair, deceptive or abusive practices.”The third was that agencies should “issue guidance and rules to address current and emergent risks in the digital asset ecosystem.” You get the drift.The rest of the report emphasizes support of FedNow, the Federal Reserve’s instant payment network due to launch in mid-2023, as a solution for financial exclusion – in other words, the U.S. doesn’t need crypto payments efficiency, it has the Fed.And then we have the official document released in January of this year, titled “The Administration’s Roadmap to Mitigate Cryptocurrencies’ Risks.” You almost don’t need to read it to know what it contains – the last sentence of the very first paragraph spelled it out: “As an administration, our focus is on continuing to ensure that cryptocurrencies cannot undermine financial stability, to protect investors, and to hold bad actors accountable.” The tone had moved from supportive to antagonistic to somewhat panicked.But to blame the shift in the U.S. regulatory tone on crypto fraudsters is simplistic. Another significant change in the regulatory backdrop between the executive order and the two updates is the economic mood, and this is more significant than many realize.Read more: George Kaloudis - The Banking Crisis Is Not Crypto’s FaultWhen the executive order was published, the Federal Reserve had not yet started its interest rate hiking campaign; it would kick this off with the first 25 basis point hike at the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting the following week. The market knew rate hikes were coming. U.S. headline consumer price index (CPI) data showed inflation was rising rapidly, reaching 7.9% for February (this would be reported the following day) – but it was seriously underestimating how high it would go. The implied rate 12 months out, according to the fed funds futures market, was a now-laughable 2.87%.At the time of the executive order, dark clouds were already building for equities. The S&amp;P 500 was round 4270, 10% down year to date. By the time of the update in September, it had fallen almost another 10%,and tech company layoffs were starting to populate headlines. Understandably, with investors hurting, the government had to seem tough on risky, largely unregulated assets that had caused deep losses. In other words, the markets needed a “bad guy” to distract from what was shaping up to be a bleak scenario in all asset groups.November delivered the ultimate “bad guy” as the FTX fraud shocked both the crypto ecosystem and mainstream observers. For a while it was an unwelcome distraction from a core inflation rate that had reached the highest level in four decades, a dollar that was at its highest relative to a basket of other currencies in two decades, and U.S. Treasury market volatility not seen since the Great Financial Crisis of 2008-2009. Things were looking bad on macroeconomic screens, but the crypto fallout presented Washington, D.C., with a problem it could show the world it was doing something about.The current hostility is about more than the political satisfaction of prosecuting criminals, however. It’s a natural reaction to broader concerns. When times get bad we seek comfort, and new, complicated and disruptive technologies are never comfortable. When times get bad we instinctively magnify external threats, because that makes us feel more connected to our tribe. When times get bad we focus more on surviving today and less on building a productive tomorrow. When times get bad the leadership manuals tell us to act stronger than we feel in order to inspire trust.On a more practical level, if the economy is about to enter a downturn, the Biden administration would probably prefer that businesses and individuals invest in more traditional, high-employment endeavors than in this newfangled notion that seeks to disintermediate national authority.I’m not suggesting the administration’s hostility toward crypto assets is just for show. I do think that it is not just because of the brutal hits to investors over the past 10 months. It is also because of the darkening clouds over the U.S. economy.Read more: David Z. Morris - Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank Reignite ‘Moral Hazard’ Dilemma Bitcoin Was Designed to EndThis has a silver lining. Just as administrations change, so do economic cycles. The antagonism is far from uniform – Thursday’s House Financial Services Committee hearing provocatively titled “Coincidence or Coordinated? The Administration’s Attack on the Digital Asset Ecosystem” is a case in point. There was a fair amount of skepticism and outright distrust among some lawmakers and one of the witnesses. But most of the witnesses and many of the elected officials present were eloquent advocates for clearer rules and a usable framework. All agreed that regulation was good, and most seemed to support the idea of market reform and the need to keep crypto business in the U.S.Hearings rarely achieve anything in the short term but they are an opportunity to stick political stakes in the ground. The initial approach of the new House Financial Services Subcommittee on Digital Assets, Financial Technology and Inclusion is encouraging in its apparently critical take on current policy and political process. Its chair, Representative French Hill (R-Ark.) made a sharp point in his written statement after articulating the need to support innovation for the sake of leadership and competitiveness while ensuring appropriate controls and accountability:“These are the administration’s own principles articulated in its Executive Order, though their recent actions seem to conflict with these principles.” (my emphasis)Indeed they do. The White House might argue that recent industry events have shown that suppression of U.S. crypto activity is in Americans’ best interests. But this lamentable shift is about much more than protecting investors from fraud – it’s a reflexive reaction to the broader economic threats gathering on the rapidly approaching horizon. Because of that, we know this will pass, as all cycles do.]"

Amongst other things, we'll want to see two things; firstly, a growing return on capital employed (ROCE) and secondly, an expansion in the company's amount of capital employed. Ultimately, this demonstrates that it's a business that is reinvesting profits at increasing rates of return. And in light of that, the trends we're seeing at QUALCOMM's (NASDAQ:QCOM) look very promising so lets take a look.What Is Return On Capital Employed (ROCE)?For those that aren't sure what ROCE is, it measures the amount of pre-tax profits a company can generate from the capital employed in its business. The formula for this calculation on QUALCOMM is:Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)0.36 = US$15b ÷ (US$50b - US$10b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to December 2022).Therefore, QUALCOMM has an ROCE of 36%. In absolute terms that's a great return and it's even better than the Semiconductor industry average of 14%. View our latest analysis for QUALCOMM roceAbove you can see how the current ROCE for QUALCOMM compares to its prior returns on capital, but there's only so much you can tell from the past. If you'd like to see what analysts are forecasting going forward, you should check out our free report for QUALCOMM.So How Is QUALCOMM's ROCE Trending?QUALCOMM has not disappointed in regards to ROCE growth. The data shows that returns on capital have increased by 306% over the trailing five years. The company is now earning US$0.4 per dollar of capital employed. Interestingly, the business may be becoming more efficient because it's applying 24% less capital than it was five years ago. A business that's shrinking its asset base like this isn't usually typical of a soon to be multi-bagger company.The Bottom Line On QUALCOMM's ROCEIn summary, it's great to see that QUALCOMM has been able to turn things around and earn higher returns on lower amounts of capital. And a remarkable 126% total return over the last five years tells us that investors are expecting more good things to come in the future. In light of that, we think it's worth looking further into this stock because if QUALCOMM can keep these trends up, it could have a bright future ahead.Story continuesQUALCOMM does have some risks though, and we've spotted   2 warning signs for QUALCOMM  that you might be interested in.High returns are a key ingredient to strong performance, so check out our free list ofstocks earning high returns on equity with solid balance sheets.Have feedback on this article?

121,0fcfd371-9bc3-3268-910d-560618becee4,LMT,2023-03-14,UPDATE 2-Biden wants $886 billion defense budget with eyes on Ukraine and future wars,Reuters,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/1-biden-wants-886-billion-161213008.html,1678723933,STORY,['LMT'],"[(Adds details on aircraft and ship retirements, last paragraph)By Mike StoneWASHINGTON, March 13 (Reuters) - President Joe Biden's biggest peacetime U.S. defense budget request of $886 billion includes a 5.2% pay raise for troops and the largest allocation on record for research and development, with Russia's war on Ukraine spurring demand for more spending on munitions.Biden's request earmarks $842 billion for the Pentagon and $44 billion for defense-related programs at the Federal Bureau of Investigation, Department of Energy and other agencies. The total amount of the 2024 budget proposal is $28 billion more than last year's $858 billion.Congress has signaled, as it often does, it will increase defense spending over Biden's request during the months-long budget process that this request kicks off. The Senate and House typically pass bills setting policy and spending levels for the Pentagon much later in the year.Congress and the administration both have an eye on a possibly prolonged war in Ukraine and potential future conflicts with Russia and China.""Our greatest measure of success, and the one we use around here most often, is to make sure the PRC (Peoples Republic of China) leadership wakes up every day, considers the risks of aggression, and concludes, 'today is not the day,'"" Deputy U.S. Defense Secretary Kathleen Hicks said on Monday.Relations between the United States and China have become highly contentious over issues ranging from trade to espionage as increasingly the two powers compete for influence in parts of the world far from their own borders.""This top line request serves as a useful starting point,"" U.S. Senator Jack Reed, Chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, said when the budget figures were unveiled on Thursday.This budget will be the first to procure missiles and other munitions with multi-year contracts, something that is routine for planes and ships, as the Pentagon signals enduring demand to top munitions makers such as Raytheon Technologies Corp, Lockheed Martin Corp and Aerojet Rocketdyne Holdings Inc .Story continuesThe Ukraine war has shown the U.S. military it needs to make bigger lots of certain types of munitions, helping to explain the multi-year contracts for weaponry that would potentially also be used in a military conflict with China.ADVANCED MISSILESThe budget boosts procurement of sophisticated missiles such as the Joint Air-to-Surface Standoff Missile-Extended Range (JASSM-ER), and the Advanced Medium Range Air-to-Air Missile (AMRAAM). Those ""are for the broader strategy - for a higher end fight. They're not ground munitions,"" like those being used in Ukraine, a senior U.S. defense official said.Thus far, funds to backfill the munitions sent to Ukraine, including the JAVELIN and Guided Multiple Launch Rocket System (GMLRS), were handled by $35.7 billion in supplemental funds enacted in 2022. The Pentagon aid to Ukraine in the budget is the same as the prior year. If more funding is needed for Ukraine, the senior defense official said, another supplemental request could be drawn up.The 2024 budget boasts a historically large research and development budget for the Pentagon - $145 billion earmarked to develop new weaponry like hypersonic missiles, which are fired into the upper atmosphere and can evade even advanced radar systems. Russia has used these missiles in Ukraine.Biden's budget request also speeds the Department of Defense's pace for buying the stealthy F-35 fighter jet to 83. The F-35 is the Pentagon's largest weapons program and will be the lynchpin of U.S. air power in the near future.The 2023 budget request asked for 61 F-35 jets made by Lockheed Martin and Congress increased that number to 77.Among the other top priorities for this budget are modernizing the U.S. nuclear ""triad"" of ballistic missile submarines, bombers and land-based missiles, shipbuilding and developing capabilities in space.The budget would benefit the biggest U.S. defense contractors including Lockheed, Raytheon, Northrop Grumman Corp and General Dynamics Corp.Some of that investment is funded by asking to retire equipment such as two of the Navy's older Littoral Combat Ships, 32 of the Air Force's non-combat ready F-22 Raptor jet fighters and 42 older A-10 Warthogs, which the U.S. withdrawal from Afghanistan last year has made less essential because they are vulnerable to more sophisticated enemies.

Using the most recent financial data, we'll take a look at whether the stock is fairly priced by taking the expected future cash flows and discounting them to today's value. Our analysis will employ the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model. Models like these may appear beyond the comprehension of a lay person, but they're fairly easy to follow.Companies can be valued in a lot of ways, so we would point out that a DCF is not perfect for every situation. If you want to learn more about discounted cash flow, the rationale behind this calculation can be read in detail in the Simply Wall St analysis model. Check out our latest analysis for Lockheed Martin The ModelWe use what is known as a 2-stage model, which simply means we have two different periods of growth rates for the company's cash flows. Generally the first stage is higher growth, and the second stage is a lower growth phase. To begin with, we have to get estimates of the next ten years of cash flows. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.Generally we assume that a dollar today is more valuable than a dollar in the future, and so the sum of these future cash flows is then discounted to today's value:10-year free cash flow (FCF) estimate2023202420252026202720282029203020312032 Levered FCF ($, Millions) US$6.27bUS$6.45bUS$6.58bUS$6.89bUS$6.76bUS$6.73bUS$6.74bUS$6.80bUS$6.88bUS$6.97bGrowth Rate Estimate SourceAnalyst x11Analyst x10Analyst x8Analyst x2Analyst x1Est @ -0.55%Est @ 0.24%Est @ 0.79%Est @ 1.17%Est @ 1.44% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 7.1% US$5.9kUS$5.6kUS$5.4kUS$5.2kUS$4.8kUS$4.5kUS$4.2kUS$3.9kUS$3.7kUS$3.5k(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$47bStory continuesAfter calculating the present value of future cash flows in the initial 10-year period, we need to calculate the Terminal Value, which accounts for all future cash flows beyond the first stage. The Gordon Growth formula is used to calculate Terminal Value at a future annual growth rate equal to the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield of 2.1%. We discount the terminal cash flows to today's value at a cost of equity of 7.1%.Terminal Value (TV)= FCF2032 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$7.0b× (1 + 2.1%) ÷ (7.1%– 2.1%) = US$141bPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$141b÷ ( 1 + 7.1%)10= US$71bThe total value, or equity value, is then the sum of the present value of the future cash flows, which in this case is US$118b. In the final step we divide the equity value by the number of shares outstanding. Compared to the current share price of US$476, the company appears around fair value at the time of writing. Valuations are imprecise instruments though, rather like a telescope - move a few degrees and end up in a different galaxy. Do keep this in mind.dcfThe AssumptionsNow the most important inputs to a discounted cash flow are the discount rate, and of course, the actual cash flows. If you don't agree with these result, have a go at the calculation yourself and play with the assumptions. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Lockheed Martin as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 7.1%, which is based on a levered beta of 0.848. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.SWOT Analysis for Lockheed MartinStrengthDebt is well covered by earnings and cashflows.Dividends are covered by earnings and cash flows.WeaknessEarnings declined over the past year.Dividend is low compared to the top 25% of dividend payers in the Aerospace &amp; Defense market.OpportunityAnnual earnings are forecast to grow for the next 3 years.Good value based on P/E ratio compared to estimated Fair P/E ratio.ThreatAnnual earnings are forecast to grow slower than the American market.Next Steps:Valuation is only one side of the coin in terms of building your investment thesis, and it is only one of many factors that you need to assess for a company. It's not possible to obtain a foolproof valuation with a DCF model. Rather it should be seen as a guide to ""what assumptions need to be true for this stock to be under/overvalued?"" For instance, if the terminal value growth rate is adjusted slightly, it can dramatically alter the overall result.

Therefore, you might want to consider some of the key factors that could influence the stock's performance in the near future.Over the past month, shares of this homebuilder have returned -4.5%, compared to the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's -5.4% change. During this period, the Zacks Building Products - Home Builders industry, which PulteGroup falls in, has lost 3.5%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?Although media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.Earnings Estimate RevisionsHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.Our analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.PulteGroup is expected to post earnings of $1.78 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -2.7%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -0.1%.The consensus earnings estimate of $7.34 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of -32%. This estimate has changed +0.3% over the last 30 days.Story continuesFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $7.34 indicates a change of -0.1% from what PulteGroup is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -5%.With an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for PulteGroup.The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPS12-month consensus EPS estimate for PHM _12MonthEPSChartUrlRevenue Growth ForecastEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.In the case of PulteGroup, the consensus sales estimate of $3.27 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of +2.5%. The $14.09 billion and $14.06 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of -13.2% and -0.2%, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryPulteGroup reported revenues of $5.17 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +18.7%. EPS of $3.63 for the same period compares with $2.51 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $4.6 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +12.33%. The EPS surprise was +26.04%.Over the last four quarters, PulteGroup surpassed consensus EPS estimates three times. The company topped consensus revenue estimates two times over this period.ValuationNo investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.Comparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.The Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.PulteGroup is graded A on this front, indicating that it is trading at a discount to its peers.

The global 5G market was valued at $60 billion in 2022, according to Grand View Research and is forecast to expand at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of nearly 60% between now and 2030. Given how powerful it is, 5G wireless is being used for much more than to surf the internet or watch videos on social media. Companies are relying on it to power artificial intelligence, cloud computing and Internet of Things (IoT) platforms and applications. Service providers are racing to keep up with demand and roll their 5G network coverage further afield. This could make 5G wireless stocks great investments. Given the growth of 5G and the strong demand for it, companies behind 5G technology and infrastructure can be expected to continue growing at a fast clip in the coming years.Here are three high-potential 5G stocks to buy in 2023.TAT&amp;T$18.24CCICrown Castle$130VODVodafone$11.53InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading Tips5G Stocks to Buy: AT&amp;T (T)women1600Source: ShutterstockAfter years of delivering mediocre returns, the shares of legacy telecommunications giant AT&amp;T (NYSE:T) appear to now be in recovery mode. In the past 12 months, T stock has risen 5%, outperforming the broader tech sector. Analysts and investors appear to be warming to the company after it spun off the Discovery TV network and sold DirectTV to a private equity firm. These changes have allowed AT&amp;T to concentrate on its core wireless  business, which is focused on expanding its 5G coverage.AT&amp;T remains the world’s largest telecommunications company and the biggest provider of mobile telephone services in the U.S. Currently, the company has more than 200 million wireless subscribers.  And AT&amp;T is ranked number one in customer satisfaction surveys, so its customers will be loyal to it.AT&amp;T has said it plans to use the $50 billion generated from the Discovery and DirecTV sales to pay down debt. The company has also largely restored its dividend after cutting it during the pandemic. Today T stock boasts a dividend yield of 6.1%Story continuesCrown Castle (CCI)Real estate investment trust REIT on an office desk.Source: Vitalii Vodolazskyi / ShutterstockCrown Castle (NYSE:CCI) is a real estate investment trust (REIT) that specializes in building and operating cell phone towers. The company operates one of the largest communications infrastructure networks in the U.S., including more than 40,000 cell towers and 85,000 miles of fiber. CCI stock has been pulled 28% lower over the past 12 months, mostly because of the stock market’s woes. But there are reasons to be upbeat about Crown Castle’s stock.The stock is well below its 52-week high of $200, presenting a nice entry point for investors looking to buy the shares at a low point. CCI stock also pays a strong quarterly dividend of $1.56 per share, which equates to a yield of 4.9%. The company has a fairly large competitive advantage and potential competitors have to overcome high barriers of entry.That’s because CCI and American Tower (NYSE:AMT) are among the two largest cell tower REITs in the U.S.  And CCI has a steady and reliable income stream because it leases tower space to the top mobile carriers, including AT&amp;T.Crown Castle’s rental revenue grew 10% in 2022, continuing its longtime trend of delivering strong growth.Vodafone (VOD)red flag with the vodaphone (VOD) logoSource: Photos by D / Shutterstock.comTurning overseas, we have Vodafone (NASDAQ:VOD), the British telecommunications giant that has operations all over the world. VOD stock gained 14% so far this year. The stock also pays a monster dividend that yields 8%. The stock, which has a price-earnings ratio of 15.30, looks fairly valued, and the company continues to expand its 5G wireless network and offerings.Vodafone is also reportedly looking to streamline its operations by selling its Africa business, a move that could generate $14 billion for the U.K.-based company.Even if it sells its Africa business, Vodafone would still have operations in more than 20 countries worldwide. While some investors gripe that Europe’s telecommunications market is bogged down by excessive regulations, Vodafone continues to be a major player in the sector. And it’s hard to ignore the high dividend  yield of VOD stock.On the date of publication, Joel Baglole did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

So, it might be a good idea to review some of the factors that might affect the near-term performance of the stock.Over the past month, shares of this fertilizer maker have returned -4.3%, compared to the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's -5.4% change. During this period, the Zacks Fertilizers industry, which Mosaic falls in, has lost 8.6%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?While media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.Earnings Estimate RevisionsRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.We essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.Mosaic is expected to post earnings of $1.52 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -36.9%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -29.1%.The consensus earnings estimate of $7.79 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of -29.3%. This estimate has changed -13.1% over the last 30 days.For the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $5.57 indicates a change of -28.6% from what Mosaic is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed +1.6%.Story continuesWith an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions.

For the current and next fiscal years, $15.44 billion and $12.93 billion estimates indicate -19.3% and -16.3% changes, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryMosaic reported revenues of $4.48 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +16.7%.

(NYSE: ROK), the world’s largest company dedicated to industrial automation and digital transformation, today announced the results of the 8th annual ""State of Smart Manufacturing Report."" The global study surveyed more than 1,350 manufacturers across 13 of the leading manufacturing countries.This press release features multimedia.

Additionally, 36% of respondents believe they will be able to repurpose existing workers due to their increasing use of technology.Of the 95% of manufacturers who have formal or informal ESG policies in place, 42% cite ""improving efficiencies"" as the top driving factor for pursuing ESG initiatives.Story continues""Manufacturers are continuing to seek opportunities for profitable growth but are realizing that uncertainty in workforce availability is impacting quality, along with their ability to meet evolving customer needs,"" said Veena Lakkundi, senior vice president, Corporate Strategy and Development, Rockwell Automation. ""The survey found that smart manufacturing technology is enabling manufacturers of all sizes to optimize more resilient, agile, and sustainable solutions that accelerate transformation. If we’ve learned anything from history, it’s that organizations that invest in innovation, with a bias for action, during times of uncertainty can outpace competitors.""Based on the survey findings, technology is crucial to mitigating risk and delivering growth. However, for one-third of manufacturers, the range of available systems and platforms is leading to ""technology paralysis"" – an inability to decide between solutions. Manufacturers can overcome this indecision by choosing a partner with relevant industry expertise and experience who can advise and guide them in implementing a fit-for-purpose solution to achieve desired outcomes.""At Rockwell, we combine the power of our portfolio of industry solutions with our second-to-none partner ecosystem to serve as a trusted advisor to leading companies around the world,"" said Lakkundi.

131,69adaf5c-98cb-3bc2-a5e7-4566cef1df3a,ROK,2023-03-14,Here's Why You Should Hold Apogee (APOG) in Your Portfolio Now,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/heres-why-hold-apogee-apog-174805711.html,1678729685,STORY,"['APOG', 'ROK', 'TS']","[Apogee Enterprises APOG has been delivering sequential improvement in margins and adjusted earnings per share (EPS) in the last six quarters, which is impressive considering the ongoing supply-chain disruptions and inflationary pressures. This has been aided by continued strong performance in Architectural Services and Framing Systems, which is likely to continue the momentum. Pricing actions and benefits from completed restructuring actions will also drive APOG’s growth.Apogee currently has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) and a VGM Score of A. Our research shows that stocks with a VGM Score of A or B, combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), or a Zacks Rank #3 offer the best investment opportunities. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Let’s delve deeper and analyze the factors that make this stock worth holding at present.Solid Q3 Results: APOG reported adjusted EPS of $1.07 for third-quarter fiscal 2023 (ended Nov 26, 2022), which surged 69.8% from the prior-year fiscal quarter’s 63 cents. Revenues were $368 million in the quarter, up 10.2% year over year. This growth was aided by solid improvement in the Architectural Framing Systems and Architectural Glass segments.Upbeat FY23 Guidance: Apogee expects fiscal 2023 adjusted EPS between $3.90 and $4.05, backed by upbeat third-quarter fiscal 2023 results. The midpoint of the revised guidance indicates 60% growth from fiscal 2022’s adjusted EPS of $2.48. The company anticipates revenue growth of 10% for full-year 2023, primarily driven by growth of Architectural Framing Systems.Positive Earnings Surprise History: APOG has an average trailing four-quarter earnings surprise of 45.9%.Healthy Growth Projections: The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Apogee’s fiscal 2023 earnings is currently pegged at $3.96, indicating a 7% increase year over year. The earnings estimate has remained stable in the past two months.Growth Drivers in Place: The Architectural Glass segment is growing as a result of better pricing and product mix, which reflect the company's strategic shift toward more premium products. The segment's operating margins have improved sequentially for five consecutive quarters. This was due to improved sales mix and productivity gains from its Lean program, as well as higher pricing that has helped offset the impact of inflated costs.The company expects backlog growth in fiscal 2023 as well, backed by strong projects pipeline and improving order trends. This is likely to drive the company’s top and bottom line for at least the next two years. The company’s segments have the potential to increase market share, expand into new geographies and markets, and introduce new products. The company completed realignment of Framing Systems to support its go-to-market approach and enhance focus on target markets.

(Nasdaq: ILMN), a global leader in DNA sequencing and array-based technologies, confirmed today that it has received notice from Icahn Partners LP and certain of its affiliates of their intention to nominate three candidates—two current Icahn employees, Jesse Lynn and Andrew Teno, and one former Icahn employee, Vincent Intrieri—for election to the Board of Directors at Illumina's 2023 Annual Meeting of Shareholders.Illumina regularly engages with shareholders on its business, financial performance and corporate governance, and welcomes constructive engagement with the goal of increasing shareholder value.Upon receipt of Icahn Partners' nominations, Illumina's independent Chairman of the Board, John Thompson, and Chief Executive Officer, Francis deSouza, engaged in multiple conversations with Carl Icahn. Illumina's Nominating/Corporate Governance Committee also met with the three nominees. Mr. Icahn was explicit and unyielding in his demand that any resolution should give him outsized influence and control. The Board has determined Icahn's nominees lack relevant skills and experience, and that it is not in the best interests of shareholders to appoint Mr. Icahn's three nominees to the Board of Illumina. The Board recommends that shareholders not support Mr. Icahn's nominees.Illumina's Board is led by an independent chair and all nine members of the Board are independent with the exception of the CEO. Illumina has an experienced Board comprised of directors who bring a range of perspectives to the company and represent the interests of its shareholders. Members of the Board bring extensive business, financial, operating, regulatory and scientific backgrounds in the life sciences and technology sectors. The Illumina Board has been continually refreshed, with over half of the Board appointed within the past five years.Icahn's letter neither recognizes the real value that GRAIL can provide to Illumina's shareholders, nor reflects an understanding of the regulatory process. Illumina is moving as quickly as possible to arrive at a resolution, with divestiture work already underway in advance of the European Commission's divestiture order. Illumina expects to execute a divestiture based on the terms of the final order, expeditiously and in a manner that serves the best interests of Illumina's shareholders, unless Illumina wins the jurisdictional appeal in the meanwhile.Story continuesIllumina is focused on supporting its valued customers with transformative innovations. Customers' interest worldwide remains very strong, and they are eager to harness the capabilities of Illumina's best-in-class products, including the revolutionary NovaSeq X – the most powerful, most sustainable, and most cost-effective sequencer ever developed – to further unlock the power of the genome.Illumina's Board and management team continue to advance the business and fulfill the company's important mission to improve human health with the goal of driving long-term shareholder value.At this time, shareholders are not required to take any action.

These traits have been the key burdens on the participating companies’ profits. Additionally, adverse currency movements threaten the industry players due to their worldwide presence.However, the industry players are well-poised to benefit from the favorable health and wellness trends, which have been boosting the demand for activewear and athletic shoes. The new and innovative designs, along with increased consumer awareness about leading a healthy lifestyle, will likely continue to aid sales of fitness clothes and footwear. The industry players, focused on product innovation, store expansion, digital investments and omni-channel growth, are expected to gain.The industry participants have been investing in product innovation to gain market share. Investments in products and e-commerce portals bode well for players like NIKE Inc. NKE, Deckers Outdoor DECK, Skechers SKX and Wolverine World Wide WWW.About the IndustryThe Zacks Shoes and Retail Apparel industry comprises companies that design, source and market clothing, footwear and accessories for men, women and children under various brand names. Product offerings of the companies mostly include athletic and casual footwear, fashion apparel and activewear, sports equipment, bags, balls, and other sports and fashion accessories. The companies showcase their products through their branded outlets and websites. Some companies distribute products via other retail stores such as national chains, online retailers, sporting goods stores, department stores, mass merchandisers, independent retailers and catalogs.A Look at What's Shaping Shoes and Retail Apparel Industry's FutureCost Headwinds: Companies in the industry are witnessing elevated costs due to factors like commodity cost inflation, increased freight costs, reinvestments and other impacts. Supply-chain constraints, and elevated ocean freight and logistic costs have been acting as deterrents. A number of companies expect increased freight and logistic costs to hurt margins in the near term. Elevated marketing expenses, higher operating overhead and demand-creating expenses, and increased investments to enhance store and digital operations have been raising SG&amp;A costs. Also, the industry participants are witnessing higher costs to support brand campaigns and digital investments. The exit from the Russia business due to the Ukraine-Russia conflict is likely to be the key concern for some players. A tough and competitive labor market remains another concern. These factors pose a threat to the industry players’ margins.Consumer Demand Trends: Players in the industry have been benefiting from strong consumer demand for activewear/athleisure products and footwear and the trend is expected to continue in 2023. Athletic goods and apparel companies offer products from footwear, sweatshirts, leggings, pants, jackets and tops to yoga wear and running clothes for men and women. The increasing fashion sense is boosting the demand for innovative clothes and footwear in the United States. The industry participants have been focused on product innovations, active promotions, store expansion and enhancing e-commerce capabilities to gain market share. Favorable health &amp; wellness trends have been the key to inspiring footwear manufacturers to expand their product portfolio. The companies continue to innovate styles, materials and colors, and incorporate functional designs to grab a large share of the fast-growing market. Moreover, multi-functional shoes that cater to casual and formal looks have been gaining popularity. The increased participation of women in sports and outdoor activities in recent years has been a boon for industry players.E-Commerce Investments: E-commerce has been playing a crucial role in the athleisure market’s growth. The companies in the segment are looking to build a customer base through websites, social media and other digital channels. As consumers continue to shop from home, growth of athletic-inspired apparel and digital sales are likely to continue. Companies focused on expanding their athletic-based apparel lines and building on e-commerce capabilities are expected to witness growth in the long run. Efforts to accelerate deliveries through investments in supply chains and order fulfillment avenues are likely to provide an edge to the industry players. Simultaneously, companies are investing in renovations and improved checkouts, as well as mobile point-of-sale capabilities, to make stores attractive. The efforts to enhance experiences through multiple channels are likely to contribute significantly to improving traffic and transactions both in stores and online.Story continuesZacks Industry Rank Indicates Bleak ProspectsThe Zacks Shoes and Retail Apparel Industry is an 11-stock group within the broader Zacks Consumer Discretionary sector. The industry currently carries a Zacks Industry Rank #194, which places it in the bottom 23% of more than 250 Zacks industries.The group’s Zacks Industry Rank, which is basically the average of the Zacks Rank of all the member stocks, indicates bleak prospects for the near term. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperforms the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.The industry’s positioning in the bottom 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries is a result of a negative earnings outlook for the constituent companies in aggregate. Looking at the aggregate earnings estimate revisions, it appears that analysts are losing confidence in this group’s earnings growth potential. In the past year, the industry’s earnings estimates for 2023 have declined 28%.Before we present a few stocks that you may want to consider for your portfolio, let’s look at the industry’s recent stock-market performance and the valuation picture.Industry Vs.

The bank had long been a key player in funding startups and its failure is now expected to have a major impact on the industry moving forward, according to Varun Badhwar, Endor Labs Co-Founder and CEO.Badhwar, a serial entrepreneur, found himself scrambling to recover funds from Silicon Valley Bank last Thursday when a slack message crossed about the company’s stock price. Ultimately, Badhwar successfully recovered some funds but told Yahoo Finance his team still hasn’t been able to access the company’s account with Silicon Valley Bank.The issues will reach beyond those that banked with SVB, Badhwar argues. Payrolls will be challenged at a variety of startups who also had exposure to companies that banked with SVB.Other regional banks in the area have also seen their stock prices under pressure off the news. First Republic Bank (FRC) closed Monday’s trading session down 61.83% while Zions Bancorporation National Association (ZION) and Western Alliance Bancorporation (WAL) both closed down more than 25%.Yahoo Finance's Seana Smith and Dave Briggs speak with about his experience as a Silicon Valley Bank customer.Key video moments00:00:05 - Companies at risk00:00:35 - Badhwar's experience with SVBVideo Transcript- How big of a deal is this for Silicon Valley? Is it right up there with 2008?VARUN BADHWAR: This is huge because you have tens of thousands of employees in this ecosystem that will not get paid if wires don't start clearing by today. You also have to remember it's not just us companies without the money. It's also a lot of our payroll providers who are banking at Silicon Valley Bank. And just so everybody understands, even though everything is supposed to be fine as of this morning, for the last several hours, I have tried unsuccessfully to log in and access my Silicon Valley Bank accounts online, continue to get errors.I've got reports from our payroll providers that they have not been able to successfully withdraw wires out of Silicon Valley for rest of the customers of theirs. We are fortunate. We directly wired money from First Republic to them. So our employees will get paid on time. But this has a trickle down effect across the entire ecosystem when employees don't get paid on time.]"

We've got to talk about the regional banks. First Republic Bank, a Charles Schwab, a Zions Bank, Bancorp have really been on the move the last several days following the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank last Friday, and then also what we saw Signature Bank over the weekend. First Republic Bank closing off the last two days, a loss of 67%.Even today, we were looking at a loss of nearly 62%, that five-day chart really illustrating the downward slope that we have certainly seen at least in extended trading, recouping some of those earlier losses, really just a fraction of it. We're seeing similar pressure in Charles Schwab. Now over the last five days, that stock off just about 32%. It closed today off just around 11 and 1/2%, so paring some of the steeper losses that we saw during the interday trading after the bank did come out defending its portfolio, trying to reassure some of that skepticism that's out there from investors in extended trading. We're looking at gains of just about 1%.And Zions was off 25% today, moving slightly to the upside in extended trading. Of course, these are all among our top trending tickers here at Yahoo Finance. That has been the case for at least the last 24 hours. It likely will be the case going forward here as the fallout and we work through some of the latest headlines and pertains to Silicon Valley Bank and also Signature Bank, some very important stocks to keep an eye on here.Let's also talk about United Airlines. Switching gears here just a bit, the company out with updated guidance. And we're seeing the disappointment reflected in extended trading, with the stock off just over 6%. The company now says that it sees its Q1 adjusted EPS loss of $0.60 to a dollar. One of the reasons for that, some of the expenses related to a new collective bargaining agreement with Airline Pilots Association. Originally, they were expecting that charge in the second quarter. They moved that up to the first quarter. That's why we're seeing the stock under pressure, off just about 6 and 1/2% because of that revised loss per share outlook from United for the current quarter right now.The company, though, is saying that it does still see strong demand environment.

The move was backed by solid volume with far more shares changing hands than in a normal session. This compares to the stock's 27.5% gain over the past four weeks.The sudden soar in the stock price was observed after Seagen's press release on Monday, stating that the pharma giant, Pfizer PFE, is set to acquire the company for $229 per Seagen share in cash, bringing up the valuation of the company to a whopping $43 billion. The anticipated merger will add Seagen's portfolio of antibody drug conjugates and technology to Pfizer's already robust portfolio of oncology drugs. Both companies expect to complete the trasaction in late 2023, or by early 2024, subject to the fulfillment of certain terms and conditions. This biotechnology company is expected to post quarterly loss of $0.83 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of -12.2%. Revenues are expected to be $522.05 million, up 22.4% from the year-ago quarter.While earnings and revenue growth expectations are important in evaluating the potential strength in a stock, empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.For Seattle Genetics, the consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 8.6% higher over the last 30 days to the current level. And a positive trend in earnings estimate revision usually translates into price appreciation.

(TSE: 4503, President and CEO: Kenji Yasukawa, Ph.D., ""Astellas"") today announced positive topline results from the Phase 3 China ARCHES study of XTANDI® (enzalutamide) plus androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) in men with metastatic hormone-sensitive prostate cancer (mHSPC) versus placebo plus ADT. The study met its primary endpoint, demonstrating a statistically significant improvement in time to prostate-specific antigen (PSA) progression (TTPP), defined as a ≥ 25% increase and an absolute increase of ≥ 2 µg/L (2 ng/mL) above the nadir (i.e., lowest PSA value observed post baseline or at baseline), which is confirmed by a second consecutive value at least 3 weeks later. At the topline analysis, the safety of XTANDI plus ADT was broadly consistent with the known safety profile for the medication. Astellas stands on the forefront of healthcare change to turn innovative science into value for patients.(PRNewsFoto/Astellas Pharma Inc.)The study also met key secondary endpoints, demonstrating that treatment with XTANDI plus ADT notably reduced the risk of radiographic progression-free survival (rPFS) and increased the rate of patients with undetectable PSA versus placebo plus ADT.""With the rising incidence of prostate cancer diagnoses among men in China, there is a need for new and effective treatment options,"" said Ahsan Arozullah, M.D., M.P.H., Senior Vice President and Head of Development Therapeutic Areas, Astellas. ""As observed in our global Phase 3 ARCHES study, and now reaffirmed with China ARCHES, XTANDI significantly delays the time to disease progression in men with mHSPC and may provide an important treatment option for men in China if approved.""""While past global studies have supported the use of XTANDI plus ADT in men with mHSPC, it is encouraging to see these results replicated for patients in mainland China,"" said Prof. Zhou Fangjian, Head of Urology Department, Sun Yat-sen University Cancer Center, Sun Yat-sen University.Story continues""As an existing standard of care for Chinese men with castration-resistant prostate cancer, XTANDI has the potential to help men earlier in their treatment journey – before their disease stops responding to therapies that lower testosterone,"" said Prof. Ye, Dingwei, Vice President of the Fudan University Shanghai Cancer Center, Director of the Multi-disciplinary Team for GU Cancer.Detailed results from China ARCHES will be submitted for publication in the near future. Data from China ARCHES will be shared with the China National Medical Products Administration (NMPA) to potentially support a regulatory filing.XTANDI has not been approved by the NMPA for the treatment of mHSPC.This result will have no impact on the financial forecasts of the current fiscal year ending March 31, 2023.About Metastatic Hormone-Sensitive Prostate CancerIn China, prostate cancer is the most common tumor in male genitourinary cancers.1 It is the second most common cancer in men worldwide.2 Prostate cancer is considered metastatic once it has spread outside of the prostate gland to other parts of the body, such as distant lymph nodes, bones, lungs, and liver.3 Men are considered hormone- (or castration-) sensitive if their disease still responds to medical or surgical treatment to lower testosterone levels.4 Metastatic hormone-sensitive prostate cancer (mHSPC) has a median survival of approximately 3-4 years for men starting treatment with ADT.5About the China ARCHES TrialThe company-sponsored, multicenter, Phase 3, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled China ARCHES trial (NCT04076059) enrolled 180 Chinese patients with metastatic hormone-sensitive prostate cancer (mHSPC) across 30 sites in mainland China. Patients in the trial were randomized to receive XTANDI 160 mg daily or placebo and continued on a luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone (LHRH) agonist or antagonist or had a history of bilateral orchiectomy. The primary endpoint of the trial was time to prostate-specific antigen (PSA) progression (TTPP), defined as a ≥ 25% increase and an absolute increase of ≥ 2 ng/mL above the nadir, which is confirmed by a second consecutive value at least 3 weeks later. Secondary endpoints include radiographic progression-free survival (rPFS), time to first Symptomatic Skeletal Event (SSE), time to castration resistance, PSA response (≥ 50%), PSA response (≥ 90%), time to initiation of new antineoplastic therapy, PSA undetectable rate, which is defined as the percentage of subjects with detectable (≥ 0.2 ng/mL) PSA at baseline, which becomes undetectable (&lt; 0.2 ng/mL) during study treatment, and objective response rate (ORR).For more information on the China ARCHES trial, go to www.clinicaltrials.gov.About XTANDI® (enzalutamide soft capsules)Enzalutamide is an androgen receptor signaling inhibitor indicated for the treatment of adult men with non-metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (nmCRPC) with high-risk of metastasis or metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) who are asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic after failure of ADT in whom chemotherapy is not yet clinically indicated.6Important Safety InformationFor Important Safety Information for enzalutamide please see the Package Insert.About AstellasAstellas Pharma Inc. is a pharmaceutical company conducting business in more than 70 countries around the world.

On Thursday afternoon a bank run Silicon Valley Bank SIVB ensued, and by Friday afternoon markets were in panic mode. All major stock indexes went negative on the year and investors anticipated some government intervention over the weekend. Fortunately, they got it. The Federal Reserve along with support from the US Treasury, opened a new lending program called the “Bank Term Funding Program,” in an effort to backstop the depositors at SIVB.The potential effects of this event are quite significant and include concerns about further bank runs, poorly capitalized banks, and shifting interest rate policy. As of Monday morning, another institution, First Republic Bank FRC seems to be dealing with similar issues as Silicon Valley Bank. Shares were down -66% through morning trading Monday.As for Fed interest rate policy, the expectations of future rates hikes are shifting incredibly fast. Just last week, markets began to price in the high likelihood of the Fed resuming 50 basis point hikes, a very hawkish development. But by Friday, traders reversed that expectation, and were again pricing in 25 basis point hikes. And as of Monday morning, policy expectations have grown even more dovish, pricing in the possibility of no hike in the next FOMC meeting, and a rapid cut in interest rates by year end.If all that wasn’t enough, we are also getting critical data on inflation and unemployment this week.CME GroupImage Source: CME GroupMondayIn other news, Pfizer PFE decided to put some of that vaccine money to work, and agreed to acquire Seagen SGEN for $43 billion. After backing off from aggressive deal-making in the last few years, it looks like big-pharma thinks there are some good deals in the market. French drugmaker Sanofi SNY also agreed to purchase Provention Bio PRVB for $2.9 billion.Already down -21% YTD, PFE investors are hopeful this acquisition can renew an aging product line.Story continuesZacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchTuesdayOn Tuesday morning we are getting a slew of inflation data. CPI, and Core CPI numbers are crucial considerations for the Fed and its interest rate policy. Analysts currently expect YoY CPI to cool from 6.4% last month to 6.1% and Core CPI to go from 5.6% last month to 5.5%.WednesdayWednesday will see retail sales numbers, producer price index and core PPI, empire state manufacturing, business inventories and the homebuilder survey.Retail sales are expecting big drops to come in this report, which should have a significant impact on the leading retail stocks such as Target TGT, Walmart WMT, Costco COST and others. Last month saw retail sales grow by 3%, a strong reading, but analysts are projecting that number to flip negative this month to a -0.4% decline.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchThe strength of the U.S. consumer is going to be another important factor for the Fed when making its policy decisions. Another strong reading from retail sales and the market should expect more hawkishness from policymakers.Thursday Thursday features Philadelphia Fed manufacturing, building permits, housing starts and jobless claims data. Initial jobless claims are yet another important indicator for Fed policy, while housing starts should give a clue to the near-term future of real estate prices.Even in the face of rising interest rates, homebuilders have  been a bright spot for the stock market. Lennar Corp LEN, D.R. Horton DHI, and Toll Brothers Inc TOL along with the homebuilders ETF XHB have all outperformed the broad market YTD.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchFriday Friday morning will round up the week with data for industrial production, U.S. leading economic index, and consumer sentiment.Bottom LineThis is a huge week. The way the market reacts to all of the coming economic data as well as the developing issues in the banking sector will say a lot about the health of this market.Next Wednesday, Mach 15 is the FOMC meeting where the Fed will announce interest rate policy, and possibly give clues about its view on the state of the market.It feels like things are on a precipice. It is time to remain flexible, open-minded, and risk averse. This week and next week will be vital to the direction of the market for the rest of the year.  Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

This move outpaced the S&amp;P 500's daily loss of 0.15%. At the same time, the Dow lost 0.28%, and the tech-heavy Nasdaq gained 3.16%.Prior to today's trading, shares of the technology and consulting company had lost 7.49% over the past month. This has lagged the Computer and Technology sector's loss of 3.13% and the S&amp;P 500's loss of 5.39% in that time.Investors will be hoping for strength from IBM as it approaches its next earnings release. The company is expected to report EPS of $1.27, down 9.29% from the prior-year quarter. Meanwhile, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenue is projecting net sales of $14.28 billion, up 0.58% from the year-ago period.Looking at the full year, our Zacks Consensus Estimates suggest analysts are expecting earnings of $9.46 per share and revenue of $62.06 billion. These totals would mark changes of +3.61% and +2.52%, respectively, from last year.Investors should also note any recent changes to analyst estimates for IBM. These revisions typically reflect the latest short-term business trends, which can change frequently.

For more companies, head on over to 10 Largest Software Companies in the World by Revenue. Hardware and software are the building blocks of modern day technology. Both have to work hand in hand, and generally speaking, hardware often ends up lagging software when it comes to product development. This is due to the fact that it takes years to develop hardware from the design process to the actual chip fabrication which often requires making the machines themselves in the most advanced cases, while in the case of software, development is relatively easier since it involves iterative upgrades to smooth out any bugs and introduce new features.The global software market is also one of the biggest in the world and also one that comes with higher margins since the product costs are lower. According to research from Sky Quest, the global software market was worth $547 billion in 2021 and will grow to $872 billion by 2028 through a compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) of 7.2%. The research firm believes that emerging trends such as artificial intelligence and the internet of things (IoT) have the potential to drive the market forward, with the fastest growing segment being the one in which no coding is required and the largest segment being one where there is low code required. It adds that the no code segment will outpace the broader industry significantly in growth percentage, as it is expected to exhibit a faster growth rate of 27.6% over the same time period.All anyone can talk about these days is the growth of artificial intelligence and the use of ChatGPT for all sorts of applications, from writing to making assignments, and even writing code. However, while for the general public, using code itself to write code seems to be a novel concept, the fact is that this practice has been around for years. Starting from ChatGPT though, the bot is shown to be able to write simple Java, Python, and React code, alongside also providing conversational feedback receiving capability to admit its mistakes and improve on them. Using code to write code that then writes codes is called Metaprogramming in computer science. This practice has a multi decade history, and the first programming language capable to do so was the programming language Lisp which was introduced in 1958.Story continuesAs far as 2023 goes, there are several trends that will be important this year according to the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT). These include the growing use of robotics in business processes and operations, blockchain technologies, the Internet of Things (IoT), and advanced N3-E semiconductors fabricated by the Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (NYSE:TSM).Today, we'll look at some of the largest software companies in the world with the top picks being Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), Alphabet Inc.

173,9ecc7155-0970-391b-97f5-f90469549d08,GM,2023-03-14,11 Cheap EV Stocks To Buy,Insider Monkey,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/11-cheap-ev-stocks-buy-161327604.html,1678724007,STORY,"['TSLA', 'RIVN', 'BYDDY', 'ABB', 'LI', 'F', 'NIO', 'GM', 'FSR']","[In this article, we will be taking a look at 11 cheap EV stocks to buy. To skip our detailed analysis of the electric vehicle sector, you can go directly to see the 5 Cheap EV Stocks To Buy.The electric vehicle (EV) sector and the related battery manufacturing industry have been dominated by China for years. We have reported before that China produced about 75% of all electric vehicle battery cells as of 2023. In 2022, a Chinese EV manufacturer BYD Company Limited (OTC:BYDDF) overtook Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) as the world's largest EV maker with 1.87 million deliveries of EVs in that year, compared to the latter's 1.3 million deliveries. This development alone is enough to bear witness to the fact that China is continuing to retain its monopoly over the EV sector while the US continues to fight its dominance. Companies like Fisker Inc. (NYSE:FSR) have joined Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) in this fight. At Cowen's 15th Annual Global Transportation and Sustainable Mobility Conference, Fisker Inc.'s (NYSE:FSR) Chairman and CEO, Henrik Fisker, mentioned that he foresaw the company expanding to be able to produce a million electric vehicles in a year in 2027. As such, the company is among the fastest growing EV companies in the US today.The US has been attempting to counter the Chinese dominance over the EV sector for almost three years now. In 2021, President Biden first signed the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, also known as the Infrastructure and Investment and Jobs Act. This move signified increased funding for EV charging stations through the National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure Formula Program and the Discretionary Grant Program for Charging and Fueling Infrastructure. These programs contributed about $5 billion and $2.5 billion, respectively, to the US government's plans to uplift its local EV and EV charging companies. Later,  in 2022, the Biden-Harris administration also awarded a $2.8 billion grant to 20 companies. This grant also draws on the funds from the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law of 2021 and is meant to support the creation of battery-grade materials such as lithium, graphite, and nickel.Story continuesSuch consistent efforts to support the American EV sector may be why a number of traditional automotive companies such as Ford Motor Company (NYSE:F) and General Motors Company (NYSE:GM) have been foraging into the EV space. According to a Reuters article published in October, Ford Motor Company (NYSE:F) continued to increase its spending on new EVs throughout 2022 and had spent about $50 billion by October. The company aims to produce about 3 million battery electric models (BEVs) in 2030, an ambitious goal that shows the car maker's dedication to the EV sector.In general, the world's top automakers are planning to spend about $1.2 trillion through 2030 on the development and production of millions of EVs and their batteries and raw materials. As a result, the EV sector continues to expand, making investments in this space a relatively attractive opportunity for investors today. In many ways, several EV stocks are considered cheap investment options since analysts consider many of these stocks to be deeply undervalued. As such, we have compiled a list of the cheapest EV stocks below. Stellar companies like Fisker Inc. (NYSE:FSR) and Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA), among more, were excluded from the list for the sole reason that their valuation, based on their enterprise-value to revenue metric, could not be considered 'cheap' for the purposes of this article.11 Cheap EV Stocks To BuyLet's now take a look at the 11 cheap EV stocks to buy.Our MethodologyTo compile our list of cheap EV stocks, we shortlisted EV companies on the basis of their enterprise value-to-revenue (TTM) ratios.

Makers of planes, trains, automobiles and any heavy industrial business that, if American financial history is any benchmark, have always been reliant on debt for their businesses, expansion plans and continued existence, should take note. Tesla is, for all practical purposes, virtually debt free 20 years after incorporation.Warning! GuruFocus has detected 8 Warning Signs with SQ. Click here to check it out. TSLA 15-Year Financial DataThe intrinsic value of TSLAPeter Lynch Chart of TSLAA capital-intensive businessThe auto industry is, and always will be, a highly capital-intensive industry due to the significant amount of investment required to design, manufacture and market automobiles. Capital expenditures in this industry are high because of the high cost of materials, labor and equipment used in the production process. Additionally, automotive manufacturers require significant research and development investments to design and develop new models, meet regulatory requirements and stay competitive. This industry's capital-intensive nature means that companies require significant amounts of funding to cover the costs of production and operations, which often requires long-term investments and financial planning. Due to these factors, the auto industry is a capital-intensive industry that demands significant investment to achieve success.Historically, capital-intensive businesses in the automotive sphere have been heavily reliant on debt financing to sustain their operations. The large amounts of capital required to design and manufacture vehicles, build factories and invest in research and development mean that companies in the industry often had to borrow funds to cover these costs. Debt financing allows companies to access large sums of capital, which can be used to purchase expensive equipment, cover production costs and fund expansion initiatives. However, reliance on debt financing can also be a double-edged sword, as it can result in higher interest costs and debt servicing expenses. Despite this, automotive companies have often turned to debt financing as a means of achieving their goals due to the significant capital requirements of the industry.Story continuesHow Tesla bucked the trendFirst, let's examine how America's other major automakers compare to Tesla on the debt front. The two largest American auto manufacturers are General Motors (NYSE:GM) and Ford (NYSE:F). There used to be a lot more companies that could have been added to this list but, unfortunately, they have all gone bankrupt or been consolidated into multinational conglomerates because they couldnt manage their debt loads.General Motors was incorporated in 1908 and is headquartered in Detroit, Michigan. It produces vehicles under brands such as Chevrolet, Buick, Cadillac and GMC. GM is one of the largest automobile manufacturers in the world and has a long and storied history.Ford was founded in 1903 and is also headquartered in Michigan. It produces vehicles under the Ford and Lincoln brands and is known for its iconic Mustang sports car and F-series pickup trucks.Both GM and Ford have played significant roles in the American auto industry and have had a significant impact on the global automotive landscape for well over 100 years.Tesla was founded in 2003 by Martin Eberhard and Marc Tarpenning with the goal of accelerating the transition to sustainable energy. Elon Musk became the company's largest shareholder in 2004, which earned him a position as head of the board and the title of co-founder thanks to his financial contributions to the business. Musk was promoted to CEO in 2008, and his vision was to create a company that could build high-quality electric cars that were both efficient and ""fun to drive.""Tesla's first car, the Roadster, was released in 2008, and it was followed by the Model S sedan in 2012. Since then, Tesla has expanded its offerings to include the Model X and Model 3, as well as solar panels and energy storage products. Tesla's success can be attributed to its innovative technology, sleek designs and commitment to sustainability.More importantly for its financial situation, Tesla's mission has captured the attention of investors and consumers alike, making it one of the most valuable and influential automotive companies in the world. Through the power of a brilliant vision and Musk's efforts to hype up investors on social media, the price of Tesla stock soared to incredible heights once the electric vehicle craze really took off in 2020 onwards.Thanks to its high valuation, Tesla has been able to utilize equity funding to keep its debt low. One of the primary advantages of equity financing is that it does not require repayment in the same way that debt financing does. Instead, equity financing involves selling ownership in the company to investors in exchange for funding. This dilutes existing shareholders, but that doesn't matter if investors are still bidding up the stock anyway. This means that companies like Tesla can use the funds raised through equity offerings to support their growth and expansion initiatives without worrying about the burden of interest payments or repayment obligations.Tesla has also used its equity funding to pay down its existing debt obligations that were incurred before its stock price really took off. By reducing its debt levels, Tesla has been able to improve its financial position and increase its flexibility in terms of future financing options.Overall, Tesla's use of equity funding has been a key factor in helping the company to keep its debt low and maintain its financial stability. By using a combination of equity and debt financing, Tesla has been able to manage its finances effectively and support its growth and expansion initiatives without overextending itself.It would be easy to say that Tesla can do this only because the company, and its stock, have boomed over the past three years. This, of course, is true, but it should be noted that GM and Ford have seen their shares boom at different times over the last 120 years for various periods of time, and they never took the same path to raise sufficient equity and rid themselves of debt.GM and Ford have both seen opportunities over the past century to utilize equity to negate debt, or to just pay it off. During the early 1900s, the automotive industry was in its infancy and there was a great deal of speculation and excitement surrounding the potential for this new technology. This led to a number of booms in automotive stock prices, particularly during the years leading up to World War I. Obviously, hindsight is 20/20, but given the run up of Teslas stock in the last decade, its interesting to see how 100 years of automotive bankruptcies, failures and bailouts have informed their management of how to effectivley utalize equity and debt.One of the most notable examples of an automotive stock boom during this period was the rise of GM. Founded in 1908 by William Durant, GM quickly became one of the most successful and influential automobile manufacturers in the world. By 1915, GM had consolidated several smaller automakers and had become the largest automobile manufacturer in the world, with a market capitalization of over $1 billion.Other notable automotive companies that experienced stock price booms during this period included Ford, which went public in 1919, and Chrysler, which was founded in 1925. These companies were able to capitalize on the growing popularity of automobiles and the rapid expansion of the American economy during the early 20th century.If history is any judge of American automakers' debt, and domestic auto manufacturing as a whole, debt is the main reason only two American companies are even on this list next to Tesla. Since horseless carriages started losing ground to the automobile, extreme amounts of debt and bankruptcies have plagued every single car manufacturer in America. Here is a very brief highlight of some of the domestic auto manufacturers that have either declared bankruptcy, restructured, or needed government bailouts since 1900.Studebaker: One of the earliest American automobile manufacturers, Studebaker struggled during the Great Depression and eventually filed for bankruptcy in 1933.Packard: Packard was a luxury automaker that faced financial difficulties in the 1950s due to competition from other luxury brands. The company merged with Studebaker in 1954 and eventually went bankrupt in 1958.American Motors Corporation: This company was formed in 1954 through a merger of several smaller automakers. The company struggled financially in the 1970s and was eventually acquired by Chrysler in 1987.Chrysler: Chrysler faced financial difficulties in the late 1970s and was bailed out by the U.S. government in 1979. The company faced financial difficulties again in the late 2000s and was bailed out by the government again in 2009.General Motors: GM faced financial difficulties during the 2008 financial crisis and was bailed out by the U.S. government in 2009.Ford: While Ford did not require a government bailout during the 2008 financial crisis, the company did face significant financial difficulties and had to restructure its operations to remain competitive.Currently, barring any loan restrictions or covenants, Tesla could pay off the entirety of its debt today with the companys cash on hand. Below I will outline these three American companies corporate debt, market capitalization, total sales, cash and their surplus/deficiency in cash to debt.Big 3 American Auto manufacturer stats (information from most recent financials publicly available)FordGMTeslaTotal Long Term Debt$140 Billion$115 Billion$5 BillionMarket Cap$48.23 Billion$50.93 Billion$548 BillionTotal Sales$158 Billion$156 Billion$81 BillionCash Available$44 Billion$31 Billion$22 BillionDebt Minus Cash$94 Billion$84 Billion$17 Billion SURPLUS in CashTesla currently could pay off all its debt tomorrow as it currently sit on a surplus of $17 billion dollars of cash minus corporate debt. Unlike the two other largest automakers in the U.S., Tesla is not beholden to creditors. In 20 years, Tesla has accomplished something that the rest of the automakers havent been able to accomplish in 120 years.Granted, the modern-day U.S. equity market is the hottest equity market in history in terms of the sheer volume of cash that flows into it. Never before has such a demand for equity been available, not even in the U.S. 100 years ago, so it's entirely possible that even if GM and Ford had decided to raise more equity to pay down their debt, it may not have been the right decision - it's hard to tell with the gap of time. However, I believe the mentality that an automaker must carry loads of debt is a thing of the past.This article first appeared on GuruFocus.]"

You're looking at losses of just about 4 and 1/2%. Investors dumping regional banks as the fallout spreads from the failure of Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank. Some fears there spreading to the other players in this space.But with today's drop, not everyone is running for the hills. Citi out with a new note saying to buy the stock. The bank upgraded PNC today, calling for shares to rally more than 30% from current levels. Analyst Keith Horowitz writing, quote, ""PNC is a high quality franchise with a strong management team. And given the recent pullback, we view this as an attractive entry point.""Now, PNC was in the news over the weekend. There were reports out there that they were among the suitors for SVB. The bank, though, saying in a statement that it's, quote, ""not in talks to acquire SVB Financial or Silicon Valley Bank."" Shares today under a tremendous amount of pressure. And Allie, if you go to our trending ticker page, a majority of them are the bank stocks, and more specifically, the regional banks, just some of the worry out there about what the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank, what the collapse of Signature Bank, what that could signal here, at least in the medium term-- or short term, I should say, for the sector.ALLIE CANAL: Yeah, and if you take a look at some of the other stocks, like First Republic Bank, for example, that is down more than 50% today. I will say that the Street does seem fairly optimistic that what's happening at SVB will not lead to contagion. Oxford Economics out with a new note this morning saying that these bank failures, quote, ""should not have significant broader implications for the economy and are not a sign of systemic risks to the banking sector.""However, I do think that the market reaction to financial sector instability, that could lead to a softening in the Fed's rate hike announcement next week. It seems like markets are pricing in a 25 basis point hike today, as opposed to a 50 basis point increase, which was the general consensus that we saw last week. So a lot to track here, both within the regional banking sector, financial sector at large, but also with the Fed and potentially their play moving forward.]"

The move allowed them to take ownership of their development while best meeting customers' needs.PNC Career Advisors are part of the Talent Management team, providing support, guidance and consultation to employees looking to grow in their current role or prepare for the next role.Ashley Esquivel, talent mobility manager at PNC, and her teams, which includes the Career Advisors, works with 400 to 500 PNC employees actively at any given time. The team offers resources to employees seeking support in their career development and advancement - including coaching, assistance in accessing helpful resources for professional growth and development and placement in new roles. About 58% of employees enlisting the help of Career Advisors accept a new position within six months, and 29% accept a position within a year.""We help employees understand what their career options can be at PNC,"" Esquivel explains. ""Whether it's current-role focused or developing them for future positions, we believe having employees in professionally satisfying roles makes for a superior banking experience for our customers.""Though Robinson's relationship with her Career Advisor is ongoing, she describes placement in her current role as a six-month process. She began her banking career in 2015 as a part-time BBVA USA teller when she and her husband moved to Huntsville, Alabama. She joined PNC after its 2021 acquisition of BBVA USA.""I became a full-time teller and eventually moved into a financial service advisor role,"" she recalls. ""Then I started realizing I wanted to do more with my career, and I knew I didn't want to leave the bank. I had to decide if my next step was to be a branch manager, but that just wasn't for me.""Story continuesShortly before PNC's acquisition of BBVA USA, Robinson went on maternity leave. She had time to think about her next steps and decided to reach out to a Career Advisor once she returned to work.""Everything went quickly,"" she recalls. ""I met with my Career Advisor, and we had a general conversation about my aspirations so she could understand me and gain insight into what I was looking for.""Robinson spent months with her Career Advisor, planning, reworking her résumé, prepping for interviews and searching for just the right role.""I've never had anyone literally sit down with me and say, ‘It's good, but it can be better if you do this,'"" she says. ""She just took me under her wing and made me believe that we were going to get there.""The planning and preparation paid off when Robinson was hired as a payments implementation associate in the Treasury Management department, which tracks and manages the cash flow of businesses - including the funds going in and out, investments and accounts receivables.Meanwhile, Schleuder, currently a business banking center manager at PNC Plaza in Indianapolis, sought Career Advisor help after his wife received a job offer requiring the family to relocate from his branch in Saline, Michigan, to Indianapolis.""Once we decided the move to Indiana was worth it, I approached my regional manager to talk about some of the resources available to me,"" says Schleuder, who has been at PNC for almost 15 years. ""Since I had done my own research, I knew we had Career Advisors who could help.""Within a week, he was talking to a Career Advisor about relocation opportunities within PNC.Schleuder, who worked as a branch manager in Michigan, received an offer to become a branch manager at the Georgetown Road branch in Indianapolis, where he worked for 10 months before moving into his current business banking center role. With duties similar to his branch manager role, Schleuder now has a larger staff, which gives him more time to focus on business banking and prospecting for new clients.""I wanted to continue my development and obtain a position at a branch where I would be able to meet more of the clients and partners in that private banking space,"" he explains.Schleuder's conversations with his Career Advisor not only helped him develop a career plan, but they also helped him determine his next professional steps.""Two to three years out, I want to work in the financial planning space. I'm going to use PNC's education benefit, through its partnership with Guild, to become a certified financial planner,"" he says. ""Those hourlong sessions with my Career Advisor really helped me realize my path and map out my plan.""Esquivel says it's important for employees to be intentional about their career development plans so when the next opportunity arises, they are ready.""We are navigational experts for employees, but we're also here to support managers to make sure they're aware of the tools and resources available to help employees develop,"" Esquivel says.Robinson and Schleuder say building relationships with their Career Advisors has been invaluable.""Seeking the help of a Career Advisor was the best decision of my life,"" Robinson says. ""I believe having a program like this shows PNC cares about getting employees in fulfilling positions, which, in turn, helps us better support our customers and the communities we serve.""The PNC Financial Services Group, Monday, March 13, 2023, Press release pictureView additional multimedia and more ESG storytelling from The PNC Financial Services Group on 3blmedia.com.Contact Info:Spokesperson: The PNC Financial Services GroupWebsite: https://www.3blmedia.com/profiles/pnc-financial-services-groupEmail: info@3blmedia.comSOURCE: The PNC Financial Services GroupView source version on accesswire.com: https://www.accesswire.com/743412/PNC-Employees-Take-Ownership-of-Their-Careers-To-Better-Serve-Customers]"

MAR is likely to benefit from solid leisure demand, rising cross-border travel and the loyalty program. Also, its focus on hotel conversion opportunities bodes well. However, constrained RevPAR in Greater China is a concern.Let us discuss the factors highlighting why investors should retain the stock for now.Growth CatalystsMarriott has been gaining from pent-up leisure demand, reopening international borders and lenient travel restrictions. Throughout the fourth quarter of 2022, the company witnessed a steady increase in demand in the United States, Canada, the Middle East and Africa regions. The company benefited from robust leisure demand and business and cross-border travel improvements. Also, it reported a strong RevPAR recovery in Europe. Group demand in the United States and Canada increased sharply during the quarter, leading to improved occupancies and strength in ADR. With global trends improving, the company expects the recovery momentum to continue. Attributes such as pent-up demand for all types of travel, the shift of spending toward experiences versus goods, sustained high levels of employment, lifting of travel restrictions and opening borders (in most markets) are likely to aid the company in the upcoming periods.The company is benefiting from the robust growth of its loyalty program. With nearly 177 million members globally, the company’s loyalty program Marriott Bonvoy is supporting its marketing strategies. Also, the company is engaging its customers with promotional offers such as grocery and retail spending accelerators on its co-branded credit cards. In 2022, digital revenues increased 41% year over year. Mobile app users were up 32% year-over-year, while digital room nights rose 27% year over year.During the fourth quarter of 2022, the company reported solid member engagement with respect to its co-branded credit cards. Backed by solid customer acceptance for credit card programs and a rise in credit card average spending, the company anticipates higher contributions from credit card fees in 2023. In 2023, the company expects total fees to rise between 6% and 12%, while the non-RevPAR-related component is anticipated to rise 4% to 7% year over year.Marriott is consistently trying to expand its presence worldwide and capitalize on the demand for hotels in international markets. During the second quarter of 2022, the company announced an agreement with Vinpearl to open eight hotels in Vietnam. The deal is expected to add 1,700 rooms to the system. The company is focused on hotel conversion opportunities to mitigate the impact of construction delays caused by the pandemic. In 2022, conversions represented 20% of room signings and 27% of room openings. The company expects positive development trends to continue on the back of new development and multiunit conversion opportunities. For 2023, the company anticipates net room growth in the range of 4-4.5% year over year.Story continuesConcernsZacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchShares of Marriott have inched up 1.8% in the past year compared with the industry’s 5.3% growth. The coronavirus crisis continues to cause disruptions to the global economy and the hospitality industry. During the fourth quarter, strict COVID policies in China dented travel demand. RevPAR remained constrained in Greater China. During the quarter, comparable system-wide RevPAR in Greater China fell 18.2% year over year. Occupancy declined 7.7% from 2021 levels and ADR fell 4.6% year over year. The company expects demand to remain uneven in the near term.Zacks Rank &amp; Stocks to ConsiderMarriott currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

In the most recent test measuring performance of major wireless carriers throughout Atlanta, Verizon not only wins for overall network performance, but is unbeaten in categories including accessibility, reliability and performance in texts and calls. Today’s results show remarkable speeds for Verizon customers in Atlanta with Verizon’s median download speed increasing 113% in the market and Verizon’s median upload speeds increasing by 37% since last year*.“Our network engineers work tirelessly to ensure we can provide the most reliable connections across Atlanta. We will continue to unlock the power of 5G for our customers with better connectivity for their phones, homes and businesses, as part of our ongoing commitment to this community,” said Eric Lia, Vice President of Engineering and Operations for Verizon.Network enhancements in AtlantaThese top marks are a result of months of deploying new enhancements in the network for those who live in and visit the Atlanta area. Currently 79% of people in Atlanta are covered with 5G Ultra Wideband service. That coverage has been expanded recently with the addition of six new macro cell sites and 18 new small cell sites. These new macro cell sites are providing additional coverage and capacity in Powder Springs, Marietta, and Austell, as well as west of Atlanta, in the west of Covington and in the south of Peachtree City. Additional small cells are providing capacity and coverage around the Truist Park and Battery, in Dekalb County, along Cobb Parkway adjacent to Cumberland Mall, in Roswell and in Hiram.Atlanta’s exceptional 5G coverage uses a combination of mmWave spectrum and Verizon’s recently acquired C-band spectrum. Atlanta was among the first to use a full 100 MHz of C-band spectrum almost doubling the spectrum available for 5G Ultra Wideband in many parts of the country. That additional spectrum will turbo charge the service, offering significantly higher speeds, much greater capacity to accommodate more customers and more robust services.Story continuesLastly, the addition of 5G service and the many additional wireless solutions allow far more data to travel on the wireless network in Atlanta. That exponential increase in data carried into and out of the cell sites serving the community requires upgraded fiber optic cable links. Fiber optic cables are used to move data between cell sites and connect those sites to the rest of the network. Verizon has increased the capacity on the fiber connections in many cell sites in the Atlanta area so they can carry 10 times the amount of data.Services from the network customers rely onFor customers in Atlanta, the additional coverage and capacity means more customers now have access not only to reliable, fast mobile service, but also Verizon Home Internet service, a different kind of home internet with no data caps. It’s ideal for anyone who wants super fast connectivity to stream, game or even work remotely. Verizon Home Internet is reliable and fast enough to power home connected devices: smart TVs, tablets, phones, gaming consoles and more. Plans start at just $25 per month with AutoPay and a select 5G mobile plan – all without extra fees, equipment charges, annual contracts or data caps.** Go to verizon.com/home for availability. Visit verizon.com/deals For the latest 5G phones and accessories.Additionally, through Verizon Frontline, the advanced network and technology developed over three decades of partnership with first responders to meet their unique and evolving needs, public safety agencies in the Atlanta area will also be able to experience the benefits of these network enhancements.

201,7e7959bf-8bcc-377f-aca1-6a16cf00d40c,VZ,2023-03-14,Verizon continues to upgrade Tucson's best network,GlobeNewswire,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/verizon-continues-upgrade-tucsons-best-130000690.html,1678798800,STORY,['VZ'],"[Verizon Sourcing LLCRecent upgrades lead to testing results that show customers in Tucson have the best experience on Verizon’s networkTUCSON, Ariz., March 14, 2023 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Customers in Tucson, Arizona have the best experience when using the Verizon network, according to the nation’s most rigorous scientific testing company RootMetrics®. In the most recent test measuring performance of major wireless carriers throughout Tucson, Verizon not only wins for overall network performance, but is unbeaten in every single category measured including accessibility, speed, reliability and performance in texts and calls. Today’s results show remarkable speeds for Verizon customers in Tucson with Verizon’s median download speed increasing 232% in the market*. This marks the 18th testing period in a row Verizon’s network is unbeaten in Tucson.“We know our customers don’t stand still, and neither will we,” said Phillip French, Vice President of Engineering and Operations for Verizon. “Our team will continue enhancing and evolving the network to meet the needs of our customers and continue to provide the network Tucson residents can rely on.”Network enhancements in Tucson, AZThese top marks are a result of months of deploying new enhancements in the network for those who live in and visit the Tucson area. Network engineers have been busy deploying 5G Ultra Wideband service throughout Tucson, with 5G service added to over 100 cell sites throughout the community using Verizon’s recently acquired C-band spectrum. Those sites, as well as new sites being activated throughout the year this year will all have access to significantly more bandwidth - 200 MHz of C-band spectrum by the end of 2023. By comparison, sites now are using 60 MHz or 100 MHz.“Think of it this way, we are adding more lanes onto an already wide and fast highway,” said French. “The more lanes, the more cars can get on and off the interstate and the faster they can drive. In the same way, the more spectrum we open up on our network, the more data can move across our network faster and more efficiently.”Story continuesIn addition to adding more 5G service using C-band spectrum, Verizon is also deploying 5G service using Millimeter Wave (mmWave), its premium, high-band spectrum which allows for extremely fast speeds and massive capacity. Verizon has recently added more than 240 5G Ultra Wideband sites using mmWave spectrum, primarily covering downtown Tucson and neighborhoods North of downtown and south of Catalina Foothills.Verizon engineers recently constructed a new cell site which is providing service in east Tucson, north of I-10 on N. Houghton Rd and South of East Irvington Rd. This new key macro is serving the community East of North Houghton Rd towards the Ole Spanish Trail.One key element that differentiates Verizon’s service for their customers is their ownership and use of upgraded fiber connections to cell sites. Fiber optic cables are used to move data between cell sites and connect those sites to the rest of the network. Verizon has increased the capacity on the fiber connections in over 100 cell sites in the Tucson area so they can carry 10 times the amount of data.“With 5G, people are doing more things in more places with their wireless devices, and we now see Verizon Home Internet customers, who are using the same network infrastructure, using more data as well,” said French. “We’ve exponentially increased the capacity on our cell sites with all the C-band and mmWave spectrum we’re using in the market, but we don’t want the fiber connections to our cell sites to be a bottleneck that could slow the pace of data traffic moving around our network. That’s why we have increased those pipes as well.”Finally, working to ensure the network is available when and where it is needed, Verizon engineers improved capacity at Tucson Medical Center to boost in-building service during times when employees and visitors in the center are using their cell phones the most.Services from the network customers rely onFor customers in Tucson, the additional coverage and capacity means more customers now have access not only to reliable, fast mobile service, but also Verizon Home Internet service, a different kind of home internet with no data caps. It’s ideal for anyone who wants super fast connectivity to stream, game or even work remotely. Verizon Home Internet is reliable and fast enough to power home connected devices: smart TVs, tablets, phones, gaming consoles and more. Plans start at just $25 per month with AutoPay and a select 5G mobile plan – all without extra fees, equipment charges, annual contracts or data caps.** Go to verizon.com/home for availability.

If you want to read about some more clothing companies, go directly to the 5 Most Valuable Clothing Companies in the World.After experiencing 18 months of robust growth (early 2021 through mid-2022), the clothing industry faces a challenging climate once again. Hyperinflation and depressed customer sentiments had already resulted in declining growth rates in the second half of 2022, and a slowdown is likely to persist this year. The Russia-Ukraine war has disrupted the chances of global economic recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic, at least in the short term. This has led to economic sanctions on multiple countries, a steep rise in commodity prices, and supply chain disruptions, thus causing inflation across goods and services.According to a survey conducted by McKinsey, a global management consulting firm, clothing companies are anticipating a spike in their costs on account of inflation, with 97 % of surveyed executives forecasting that their cost of goods sold and selling, general and administrative (SG&amp;A) expenses will rise in 2023. Cotton and cashmere prices, for example, have increased 45% and 30% year-on-year, respectively. The fashion market, excluding the luxury sector, will struggle to deliver significant growth in 2023. McKinsey's analysis of fashion forecasts projects relatively slow sales growth of between –2% and +3%, weighed down by a contraction in the European market. China and the United States, on the other hand, are expected to fare better.The clothing industry, also known as the apparel market, includes clothing ranging from sportswear to business wear to daily wear to luxury products. The pandemic has acted as a massive restraint on the apparel manufacturing market in 2022 as supply chains were disrupted due to trade restrictions and consumption declined due to lockdowns imposed by governments globally. Despite this, the global clothing market has endured relatively better compared to other industries, growing from $610.12 billion in 2022 to $652.94 billion in 2023. In terms of future outlooks, the market is further expected to grow to $830.69 billion in 2027 at a CAGR of 6.2%. In global comparison, the United States led the charge with $343.70 billion in revenues. With intense competitive rivalry in the industry, leading companies have continued to provide product differentiation with a dynamic approach to meet the changing trends. Additionally, the increasing demand for online shopping is expected to help the apparel manufacturing market grow.Story continues15 Most Valuable Clothing Companies in the WorldPhoto by Keagan Henman on UnsplashOur MethodologyTo come up with the 15 most valuable clothing companies in the world, we used stock screeners to identify the biggest clothing companies by market capitalization.

Nevertheless, we know that our readers all have their own perspectives, so we are always looking at the latest trends in value, growth, and momentum to find strong picks.Considering these trends, value investing is clearly one of the most preferred ways to find strong stocks in any type of market. Value investors use a variety of methods, including tried-and-true valuation metrics, to find these stocks.Zacks has developed the innovative Style Scores system to highlight stocks with specific traits. For example, value investors will be interested in stocks with great grades in the ""Value"" category. When paired with a high Zacks Rank, ""A"" grades in the Value category are among the strongest value stocks on the market today.One company to watch right now is Tapestry (TPR). TPR is currently holding a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy) and a Value grade of A. The stock is trading with a P/E ratio of 10.35, which compares to its industry's average of 14.05. Over the past year, TPR's Forward P/E has been as high as 11.92 and as low as 6.70, with a median of 8.78.Investors will also notice that TPR has a PEG ratio of 0.83. This metric is used similarly to the famous P/E ratio, but the PEG ratio also takes into account the stock's expected earnings growth rate. TPR's PEG compares to its industry's average PEG of 0.85. Within the past year, TPR's PEG has been as high as 1.02 and as low as 0.57, with a median of 0.73.Investors could also keep in mind Vera Bradley (VRA), an Retail - Apparel and Shoes stock with a Zacks Rank of # 2 (Buy) and Value grade of A.Furthermore, Vera Bradley holds a P/B ratio of 0.62 and its industry's price-to-book ratio is 2.85.

The company is gaining from strong growth of artificial intelligence, high-performance computing and accelerated computing, which is boosting its Compute &amp; Networking revenues. A surge in Hyperscale demand and a solid uptake of artificial intelligence-based smart cockpit infotainment solutions are acting as tailwinds.Collaboration with Mercedes-Benz and Audi is likely to advance its presence in autonomous vehicles and other automotive electronics space. The Zacks analyst expects its Automotive segment's revenue to grow at a CAGR of 50% through fiscal 2023-2025.However, NVDA's near-term prospects look gloomy due to weakening demand for chips used in gaming and data center end markets. While macroeconomic headwinds are impacting gaming and data center chip demand, higher channel inventory levels are hurting chip prices.(You can read the full research report on NVIDIA here &gt;&gt;&gt;)McDonald's shares have outperformed the Zacks Retail - Restaurants industry over the past year (+15.3% vs. +12.9%).

The S&amp;P 500 registered its biggest weekly loss since September 2022, while the Nasdaq and the Dow posted their largest losses since November and June, respectively.Even as economic data released through the week, especially from the labor market, indicated that inflation was slowing, the market resumed its bloodbath on fears of steeper interest rate hikes ahead. The financial sector saw a broad-based selloff late in the week with the collapse of a major bank. The crypto industry also experienced massive tremors with the failure of an important crypto-lender.The 2-year treasury yield hit decade highs last week by crossing the 5% mark for the first time since 2007.

APD, DuPont de Nemours, Inc. DD, Albemarle Corp. ALB and Cabot Corp. CBT.Industry: Chemicals - DiversifiedLink: https://www.zacks.com/commentary/2063919/4-diversified-chemical-stocks-to-escape-industry-challengesThe Zacks Chemicals Diversified industry is bearing the brunt of a spike in raw material costs as well as higher supply-chain, energy and logistics costs, made worse by the Russia-Ukraine conflict. Weakness in certain markets, COVID-related impacts in China and the slowdown in Europe may also impact demand for chemicals.Industry players like Air Products and Chemicals, Inc., DuPont de Nemours, Inc., Albemarle Corp. and Cabot Corp. are banking on strategic measures, including operating cost reductions and aggressive price hikes to tide over the challenging environment.About the IndustryThe Zacks Chemicals Diversified industry consists of manufacturers of basic chemicals, plastics, specialty chemicals and agricultural chemicals. Companies in this space serve a host of end markets, such as automotive, building &amp; construction, transportation, electronics, aerospace and agriculture. Basic chemicals are produced in large quantities, and include petrochemicals and intermediates (such as ethylene, propylene and benzene), polymers (including plastic resins such as polyethylene, polypropylene and polyvinyl chloride), and inorganic chemicals (such as chlorine, caustic soda and titanium dioxide).Specialty chemicals that include catalysts, specialty polymers and coating additives are used in specific fields based on their performance. Agricultural chemicals include herbicides, fungicides and insecticides that are used to protect crops from disease, pests and weeds.What's Shaping the Future of the Chemicals Diversified Industry?Demand Worries From End-market Weakness, China Slowdown: Companies in the chemical-diversified space are facing headwinds from a slowdown in certain key markets. The semiconductor shortage has led to reduced automotive builds around the world, curbing chemical demand in this major market. The Russia-Ukraine conflict has triggered a fresh round of global microchip shortage. Both these countries are major suppliers of raw materials required for global semiconductor production.Story continuesThe chip crisis is unlikely to abate anytime soon, given the impact of the war. The sluggishness in the building &amp; construction market and customer destocking in consumer durables are other concerns. Also, the slowdown in economic activities in China due to the restrictions following a resurgence in COVID-19 infections is hurting chemical demand. The softness in China has resulted in a higher level of near-term economic uncertainty, which may continue to affect chemical volumes over the near term.Higher Input Costs Pose Margin Headwinds: The industry players are exposed to cost pressure associated with raw materials resulting from short supply. These companies also face challenges arising from higher supply-chain and logistics costs. The disruption in the supply chain has pushed up the prices of inputs. Russia's invasion of Ukraine and new government-mandated lockdowns in China have also put more pressure on the global supply chain.These companies are also facing headwinds from higher energy costs, especially in Europe, which has witnessed a significant spike in costs amid the ongoing war in Ukraine. The lingering impacts of these bottlenecks are expected to continue over the short term. Higher raw material, energy and logistics costs are, thus, likely to hurt the margins of diversified chemical companies.Strategic Actions to Aid Results: The companies in this space are taking a host of strategic measures, including cost-cutting and productivity improvement, operational efficiency improvement and actions to strengthen the balance sheet and boost cash flows. In particular, the industry participants are aggressively implementing actions to bring down costs.

Netflix’s -9% with both underperforming the S&amp;P 500’s -2%. Disney stock is up +6% year to date to top Netflix and the benchmark’s virtually flat performances.  Furthermore, after a volatile 2022, Disney and Netflix are two stocks that many believe could have substantial rebounds this year as inflationary concerns start to subside. To that note, Disney and Netflix stock sill trade 36% and 26% from their 52-week highs respectively.Disney may especially stand out to investors in terms of recovery hopes. Disney stock is still down -28% over the last year to largely underperform Netflix’s -11% and the broader indexes.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchValuationMonitoring the valuation of Disney and Netflix will continue to be important in gauging their upside and rebound prospects.In this regard, both stocks trade attractively relative to their past from a price-to-earnings perspective. Netflix especially stands out trading at $294 and 26.1X forward earnings which is well below its decade high of 513.4X and a 75% discount to the median of 107.3X.In comparison, Disney trades at $92 per share and 23.5X forward earnings, considerably beneath its own decade high of 134.4X and closer to the median of 19.9X.Even better, the price to sales that investors are paying for both companies is far more reasonable. Disney’s price to sales of 1.8X is 63% below its decade high of 5.1X and offers a 35% discount to the median of 2.9X. Looking at Netflix, its P/S multiple of 3.8X is 65% below its decade-high of 11X and 36% beneath the median of 6X.Story continuesZacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchGrowth &amp; SubscribersWith the valuation of both companies becoming more attractive, investors will want to see Disney and Netflix's growth continue.Following their most recent fiscal quarters, Netflix stood at 230.75 million subscribers which topped Disney Plus at 161.8 million subscribers. Netflix subscribers grew by 7.66 million during the quarter while Disney lost 2.4 million users its first reported decline since launching in 2019.Impressively, when including its ESPN+ and Hulu services, Disney’s total subscribers have surpassed Netflix at 234.7 million. Disney earnings are expected to rise 13% in fiscal 2023 and soar another 36% in FY24 at $5.42 per share. Sales are forecasted to be up 9% this year and rise another 7% in FY24 to $96.12 billion.As for Netflix, earnings are projected to be up 12% this year and climb another 28% in FY24 at $14.29 per share. Sales are forecasted to rise 8% in FY23 and jump another 11% in FY24 to $38.12 billion.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchTakeawayDisney and Netflix stock both land a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) at the moment. For now, most of the volatility surrounding last week’s selloff is starting to be contained within the financial sector.There may still be better buying opportunities ahead for Disney and Netflix stock but holding on to shares at their current levels could be rewarding as they appear to be resuming growth following a rough 2022 for most companies.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

At that show, Will Smith slapped presenter Chris Rock before winning best actor.This year's ceremony celebrated a rebound in moviegoing as several of the nominees, including ""Avatar: The Way of Water"" and ""Top Gun: Maverick,"" were blockbuster hits at cinemas. Multiverse adventure ""Everything Everywhere All at Once"" took home best picture and dominated the awards.While the Oscars audience increased compared with last year, it ranked as the third-lowest on record for the ceremony. Viewership of many awards ceremonies has dropped in recent years as audiences have ditched traditional television for streaming and social media.ABC said Sunday's awards were the subject of 27.4 million interactions on Instagram, Twitter, Facebook and YouTube. The Oscars also ranked as the No. 1 trending topic on Twitter worldwide throughout the broadcast.The highest-rated Academy Awards telecast took place 25 years ago, when megahit ""Titanic"" swept the honors. More than 57 million people tuned in that year.In 2021, in the middle of the COVID-19 pandemic, Oscar ratings hit their low point with 10.5 million viewers.

While the firm remains positive on Tesla's long-term opportunity and ""impressive cost trajectory,"" it is growing increasingly concerned about macro challenges facing the EV maker.Tesla has had to lower prices more than expected, and there are macro challenges that could hurt EV makers even more. For example, the Tech Sector is still struggling, and the recent implosion of SVB Financial (NASDAQ:SIVB) could make things worse, according to the firm.California is a big market for EVs (41% for Tesla) and tech (roughly 20% of California's economy), and if tech spending slows down more, the firm believes there could be more layoffs.Charles Schwab upgraded to Buy at CitiCiti upgraded Charles Schwab (NYSE:SCHW) to Buy from Neutral while cutting its price target to $75.00 from $83.00 due to a compelling risk/reward at current levels after a 23% decline over the last two trading days.Although there may be some short-term revenue/earnings headwinds from rising funding costs and continued client cash sorting, the firm believes they are already reflected in the stock price. The firm doesn't see a significant risk of deposits leaving Charles Schwab due to the composition of its deposit base and customer protections.""Tapping supplemental fundings (FHLB, CDs, etc.) will present a near-term earnings headwind, but we expect these to be temporary measures and for the company to swap out these funding sources via organic sources ASAP,"" added the firm.Shares are down more than 3% pre-market today.3 more rating changesJPMorgan downgraded Under Armour (NYSE:UA) (NYSE:UAA) to Neutral from Overweight and cut its price target to $10.00 from $13.00.Story continues""Larger picture, management is now citing Summer to Fall '23 at the earliest for the ""inventory overhang"" to be worked through, which has created an elevated promotional environment across the sector ""longer than expected"" for UAA,"" said the firm.Under Armour expects its 2023 gross margin to decline by approximately 425bps year-over-year, with around 140bps of pressure from higher promotions and discounting. This is due to Under Armour managing its own inventory and discounting more than expected to stay competitive in a sector with bloated inventory levels.UBS downgraded United Natural Foods (NYSE:UNFI) to Neutral from Buy and cut its price target to $32.00 from $48.00.The company reported a Q2 EPS miss and lowered its full-year guidance last week.

(NASDAQ: AKAM), the cloud company that powers and protects life online, today announced a new State of the Internet report that focuses on malicious Domain Name System (DNS) traffic. The report, titled, Attack Superhighway: Analyzing Malicious Traffic in DNS, finds that roughly 10-16 percent of organizations have exhibited signs of malicious command and control (C2) indicating a network breach during the past year.Akamai Technologies, Inc. logo (PRNewsfoto/Akamai Technologies, Inc.)Akamai observes nearly seven trillion DNS requests daily and classifies malicious DNS transactions into three main categories: malware, phishing and command and C2. These attacks present a major threat to both enterprises and home users.Attack Superhighway analyzes malicious DNS data and links attackers to malware such as Emotet, a malware strain that is now one of the most dangerous cybercrime services and QSnatch, which targets backups or file storage and is the largest botnet threat in enterprise environments.Additional findings of the report include:26 percent of affected devices have attempted to reach out to known initial access brokers (IAB) C2 domains, including Emotet-related domains. IABs present a large risk to organizations as their primary role is to initiate the breach and sell access to ransomware groups and other cybercriminal groups. Network-attached storage devices are ripe for exploitation as they are less likely to be patched and they hold troves of valuable data. Akamai data shows attackers are abusing these devices through QSnatch, a large botnet, with 36 percent of affected devices showing traffic leading to C2 domains related to this threat. Attacks on home networks are seeking to abuse not only traditional devices like computers, but also mobile phones and Internet of Things (IoT) devices. A significant amount of attack traffic can be correlated with mobile malware and IoT botnets.Story continuesAttack Superhighway also includes regional and industry attack data. While QSnatch is always the leading threat globally, other prevalent attacks vary across regions with Emotet, REvil, Ramnit and Agent Tesla being the other most common attacks. Regional trends are vital for organizations to consider as they decide on a particular threat focus and vulnerability management strategies,""This new report shows the massive range of cybercrime in the modern threat landscape,"" said Steve Winterfeld, Advisory CISO at Akamai. ""Attackers are unfortunately finding success when they leverage as-a-service hacking tools and are able to combine various tools in a single integrated multi-stage attack. Attack Superhighway details methodologies and analyzes indicators of these types of attacks while offering recommendations for mitigating them.""Akamai is holding a two-part webinar where we will offer a closer examination of the DNS traffic for 2022 uncovered in Attack Superhighway. We will cover how we amassed the data as well as key findings and insights.

See our latest analysis for Helmerich &amp; Payne The MethodWe're using the 2-stage growth model, which simply means we take in account two stages of company's growth. In the initial period the company may have a higher growth rate and the second stage is usually assumed to have a stable growth rate. In the first stage we need to estimate the cash flows to the business over the next ten years. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.A DCF is all about the idea that a dollar in the future is less valuable than a dollar today, and so the sum of these future cash flows is then discounted to today's value:10-year free cash flow (FCF) forecast2023202420252026202720282029203020312032 Levered FCF ($, Millions) US$391.1mUS$652.1mUS$693.9mUS$705.0mUS$600.0mUS$594.5mUS$594.4mUS$598.0mUS$604.3mUS$612.5mGrowth Rate Estimate SourceAnalyst x8Analyst x6Analyst x2Analyst x1Analyst x1Est @ -0.91%Est @ -0.02%Est @ 0.61%Est @ 1.05%Est @ 1.35% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 11% US$353US$531US$510US$467US$359US$321US$289US$263US$239US$219(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$3.6bStory continuesWe now need to calculate the Terminal Value, which accounts for all the future cash flows after this ten year period. The Gordon Growth formula is used to calculate Terminal Value at a future annual growth rate equal to the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield of 2.1%. We discount the terminal cash flows to today's value at a cost of equity of 11%.Terminal Value (TV)= FCF2032 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$612m× (1 + 2.1%) ÷ (11%– 2.1%) = US$7.1bPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$7.1b÷ ( 1 + 11%)10= US$2.6bThe total value is the sum of cash flows for the next ten years plus the discounted terminal value, which results in the Total Equity Value, which in this case is US$6.1b. To get the intrinsic value per share, we divide this by the total number of shares outstanding. Compared to the current share price of US$37.2, the company appears quite good value at a 36% discount to where the stock price trades currently. The assumptions in any calculation have a big impact on the valuation, so it is better to view this as a rough estimate, not precise down to the last cent.dcfThe AssumptionsWe would point out that the most important inputs to a discounted cash flow are the discount rate and of course the actual cash flows. Part of investing is coming up with your own evaluation of a company's future performance, so try the calculation yourself and check your own assumptions. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Helmerich &amp; Payne as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 11%, which is based on a levered beta of 1.475. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.SWOT Analysis for Helmerich &amp; PayneStrengthDebt is not viewed as a risk.WeaknessDividend is low compared to the top 25% of dividend payers in the Energy Services market.OpportunityAnnual earnings are forecast to grow for the next 3 years.Trading below our estimate of fair value by more than 20%.ThreatDividends are not covered by cash flow.Annual earnings are forecast to grow slower than the American market.Looking Ahead:Whilst important, the DCF calculation is only one of many factors that you need to assess for a company. It's not possible to obtain a foolproof valuation with a DCF model. Instead the best use for a DCF model is to test certain assumptions and theories to see if they would lead to the company being undervalued or overvalued. For example, changes in the company's cost of equity or the risk free rate can significantly impact the valuation. Why is the intrinsic value higher than the current share price?

We will take advantage of the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model for this purpose. Don't get put off by the jargon, the math behind it is actually quite straightforward.Companies can be valued in a lot of ways, so we would point out that a DCF is not perfect for every situation. Anyone interested in learning a bit more about intrinsic value should have a read of the Simply Wall St analysis model. Check out our latest analysis for Comcast What's The Estimated Valuation?We use what is known as a 2-stage model, which simply means we have two different periods of growth rates for the company's cash flows. Generally the first stage is higher growth, and the second stage is a lower growth phase. In the first stage we need to estimate the cash flows to the business over the next ten years. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.Generally we assume that a dollar today is more valuable than a dollar in the future, so we discount the value of these future cash flows to their estimated value in today's dollars:10-year free cash flow (FCF) estimate2023202420252026202720282029203020312032 Levered FCF ($, Millions) US$13.0bUS$14.4bUS$16.3bUS$16.9bUS$17.8bUS$18.5bUS$19.1bUS$19.7bUS$20.2bUS$20.7bGrowth Rate Estimate SourceAnalyst x17Analyst x15Analyst x8Analyst x5Analyst x4Est @ 3.91%Est @ 3.36%Est @ 2.97%Est @ 2.70%Est @ 2.51% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 8.4% US$12.0kUS$12.3kUS$12.8kUS$12.2kUS$11.9kUS$11.4kUS$10.8kUS$10.3kUS$9.8kUS$9.2k(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$113bStory continuesWe now need to calculate the Terminal Value, which accounts for all the future cash flows after this ten year period. For a number of reasons a very conservative growth rate is used that cannot exceed that of a country's GDP growth. In this case we have used the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield (2.1%) to estimate future growth. In the same way as with the 10-year 'growth' period, we discount future cash flows to today's value, using a cost of equity of 8.4%.Terminal Value (TV)= FCF2032 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$21b× (1 + 2.1%) ÷ (8.4%– 2.1%) = US$333bPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$333b÷ ( 1 + 8.4%)10= US$148bThe total value, or equity value, is then the sum of the present value of the future cash flows, which in this case is US$261b. In the final step we divide the equity value by the number of shares outstanding. Compared to the current share price of US$35.5, the company appears quite good value at a 43% discount to where the stock price trades currently. Remember though, that this is just an approximate valuation, and like any complex formula - garbage in, garbage out.dcfImportant AssumptionsThe calculation above is very dependent on two assumptions. The first is the discount rate and the other is the cash flows. Part of investing is coming up with your own evaluation of a company's future performance, so try the calculation yourself and check your own assumptions. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Comcast as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 8.4%, which is based on a levered beta of 1.070. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.SWOT Analysis for ComcastStrengthDebt is well covered by earnings and cashflows.Dividends are covered by earnings and cash flows.WeaknessEarnings declined over the past year.Dividend is low compared to the top 25% of dividend payers in the Media market.OpportunityAnnual earnings are forecast to grow faster than the American market.Good value based on P/E ratio and estimated fair value.ThreatAnnual revenue is forecast to grow slower than the American market.Moving On:Whilst important, the DCF calculation is only one of many factors that you need to assess for a company. The DCF model is not a perfect stock valuation tool. Rather it should be seen as a guide to ""what assumptions need to be true for this stock to be under/overvalued?"" If a company grows at a different rate, or if its cost of equity or risk free rate changes sharply, the output can look very different. What is the reason for the share price sitting below the intrinsic value?

In one recent competitive win, Dominion Energy Virginia implemented new ADMS capabilities in Oracle Utilities NMS to improve its network visibility, reliability, and outage management response. The expanded platform will also help the utility better manage increased data from distributed energy resources (DERs) and meet its regulatory requirements.The report adds that ""Oracle's customer base benefits from the cross-cutting nature of its functionality improvements; if the company develops more sophisticated functionality for one of its ADMS customers, these capabilities are then deployed across its entire customer base upon major upgrades.""

If you want to see more stocks in this selection, check out 5 Best Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stocks To Buy According to Analysts. Artificial Intelligence (AI) is an emerging technology that has wide-ranging applications across various industries and significant implications for society. It is transforming the global economy and national security. The AI industry is flourishing globally, with funding for AI doubling to $66.8 billion in 2021. A record number of 65 AI companies reached a valuation of $1 billion or more, marking a 442% increase from the previous year. This growth trend is expected to continue as more companies and governments worldwide adopt AI solutions each year. The global artificial intelligence market size was approximately $119.78 billion in 2022 and it is forecasted to reach $1,591.03 billion by 2030, registering a CAGR of 38.1% from 2022 to 2030. The North America artificial intelligence market was worth $51 billion in 2021. Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) was originally considered to be the leader in the field of artificial intelligence. The company has gained a reputation for investing in long-term projects and researching futuristic technologies. Many of the advancements in AI chatbots were developed in Google's research labs. However, OpenAI has emerged as an early pioneer in generative AI, which refers to software that can create its own text, images, or videos. OpenAI launched ChatGPT in November 2022 and its rapid success has left Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) scrambling to catch up in this crucial area of technology. CEO Sundar Pichai has previously stated that AI will have a more significant impact on society than even fire or electricity.In its ongoing competition with Google over search, Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) has integrated artificial intelligence technology, and is now using the latest AI advancements to keep pace with competitors in the corporate applications market, such as Oracle Corporation (NYSE:ORCL), Salesforce, Inc. (NYSE:CRM), and SAP SE (NYSE:SAP). The company has launched a new AI assistant called Dynamics 365 Copilot, which is designed to help with tasks like sales, marketing, and customer service. The technology behind it comes from OpenAI, and it can create contextual chat and email responses to customer-service inquiries. The software can also assist marketers in identifying target customer groups and generating product descriptions for e-commerce.Story continuesSome of the best artificial intelligence stocks to buy according to analysts include Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), Snowflake Inc. (NYSE:SNOW), and EPAM Systems, Inc. (NYSE:EPAM). Our Methodology To determine the best artificial intelligence stocks, we narrowed down our selection to AI stocks that had the highest upside potential based on average analyst price targets. We have ranked our picks in ascending order of their average upside potential, as of March 11. 15 Best Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stocks To Buy According to AnalystsPhoto by lucas law on UnsplashBest Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stocks To Buy According to Analysts15. Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 259Average Upside Potential Based on Analyst Ratings: 17.49%On February 22, Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) introduced a preview version of its latest Bing and Edge apps for iPhone and Android devices, which include new features like voice search and access to their AI chatbot. They also announced Bing for Skype, which is powered by AI. This makes Microsoft one of the best AI stocks to think about.Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) on March 6 revealed its plan to incorporate ChatGPT technology into its developer software suite, Power Platform, as a part of its ongoing effort to increase its use. The company will be adding the technology to Power Virtual Agent and AI Builder. However, the features will only be accessible in the United States.Wedbush analyst Daniel Ives raised the firm's price target on Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) to $290 from $280 and kept an Outperform rating on the shares on February 24, following more positive recent cloud checks.According to Insider Monkey’s fourth quarter database, 259 hedge funds were bullish on Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), compared to 269 funds in the prior quarter. Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation Trust is the largest stakeholder of the company, with 39.2 million shares worth $9.4 billion. Like Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), Snowflake Inc. (NYSE:SNOW), and EPAM Systems, Inc. (NYSE:EPAM), Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) is one of the best AI stocks to invest in. Polen Global Growth Strategy made the following comment about Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) in its Q4 2022 investor letter:“In the case of Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), the company is performing very well. Azure now represents nearly 25% of the total business and continues to compound at a higher rate. Although growth is moderating a bit recently (as it is for AWS and Google Cloud Platform as well), these three platforms collectively generated more than $140 billion in revenue during the last 12 months and are still growing at a healthy rate. Further, Microsoft Cloud, or commercial cloud (which includes Azure and other cloud services, Office 365 Commercial, the commercial portion of LinkedIn, Dynamics 365, and other cloud properties) continues to grow roughly 30% and is now about half the business. Mathematically, commercial cloud could decelerate to 20% growth with all other segments decelerating to zero growth and total company revenue growth would still be at least double digits. We believe Microsoft is positioned to compound underlying earnings per share at a mid teens rate over the next five years. At 22x earnings, we felt the valuation was attractive and that it should be a large position.”14. Micron Technology, Inc. (NASDAQ:MU)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 74Average Upside Potential Based on Analyst Ratings: 17.51%Micron Technology, Inc. (NASDAQ:MU) was founded in 1978 and is headquartered in Boise, Idaho. It develops, manufactures, and sells memory and storage products worldwide. Micron Technology, Inc. (NASDAQ:MU)’s technology is fueling the development of next-generation, faster, and more intelligent global infrastructures that enable mainstream artificial intelligence. Its high-capacity memory, fast storage, and multi-chip packages provide power to AI training and inference engines, whether they are embedded in mobile and edge devices or in the cloud.On March 6, Srini Pajjuri, an analyst at Raymond James, resumed coverage of Micron Technology, Inc. (NASDAQ:MU) and assigned the stock an Outperform rating and a price target of $70. The analyst stated that it is ""encouraged"" by the memory industry's production and capex cuts, and anticipates a better demand/supply balance throughout the year. The analyst is also ""optimistic"" that the memory industry's ongoing losses will result in improved supply discipline in the next cycle.According to Insider Monkey’s Q4 data, 74 hedge funds were long Micron Technology, Inc. (NASDAQ:MU), and Andreas Halvorsen’s Viking Global is the largest position holder in the company, with 8.35 million shares worth $417.7 million. Here is what Claret Asset Management has to say about Micron Technology, Inc. (NASDAQ:MU) in its Q3 2022 investor letter:“Inflation is still higher than interest rates… not an incentive to save for most people. Either inflation must come down or interest rates have to go up further. Or both. And probably both. Now that they are taking the punch bowl away and the party is over, what happens next? For whatever reason, the stock market seems to always precede the economic reality: Micron reached a high of $98.45 on January 5th, 2022 and is trading at $50.00 today.”13. Applied Materials, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMAT)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 70Average Upside Potential Based on Analyst Ratings: 18.34% Applied Materials, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMAT) is a California-based company that engages in the provision of manufacturing equipment, services, and software to the semiconductor, display, and similar industries. It operates through three segments – Semiconductor Systems, Applied Global Services, and Display and Adjacent Markets. On February 16, Applied Materials, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMAT) reported a FQ1 non-GAAP EPS of $2.03 and a revenue of $6.74 billion, outperforming Wall Street estimates by $0.11 and $80 million, respectively. On March 1, KGI Securities analyst Derek Chang upgraded Applied Materials, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMAT) to Outperform from Neutral with a $145 price target.According to Insider Monkey’s fourth quarter database, 70 hedge funds were long Applied Materials, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMAT), compared to 67 funds in the prior quarter. David Blood and Al Gore’s Generation Investment Management is the largest stakeholder of the company, with approximately 7 million shares worth $678 million. Vulcan Value Partners made the following comment about Applied Materials, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMAT) in its Q4 2022 investor letter:“Applied Materials, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMAT) is the world’s largest producer of semiconductor manufacturing equipment. Throughout 2022, investors became increasingly concerned about a cyclical downturn in semiconductors and pending trade regulations that would restrict the sale of advanced semiconductor manufacturing equipment to Chinese customers. This uncertainty caused the stock to become oversold, in our opinion. The stock price recovered in the fourth quarter as investors were able to size the impact of export controls and, we believe, as investors increasingly understood the long-term, structural demand for semiconductors and the equipment that produces them.”12. Accenture plc (NYSE:ACN)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 63Average Upside Potential Based on Analyst Ratings: 20.62%Accenture plc (NYSE:ACN) is a global professional services company headquartered in the United States and Ireland. They offer a range of services, including strategy, consulting, technology, and operation services, to clients worldwide. Their areas of expertise include data management, data democratization, and industrialized solutions such as turnkey analytics and artificial intelligence solutions, as well as metaverse and sustainability services. Accenture plc (NYSE:ACN) is one of the best AI stocks to consider investing in.On January 30, Jeff Cantwell, an analyst at Wells Fargo, started coverage of Accenture plc (NYSE:ACN) with an Equal Weight rating and a price target of $289. Despite having a favorable opinion of Accenture plc (NYSE:ACN)’s platform and services, the firm believes that clients are becoming more cautious about technology spending and are waiting for stronger demand before making further investments. As the demand environment continues to change, Wells Fargo's revenue forecast for 2024 is 2% below consensus, as they expect clients to prioritize cost containment measures.According to Insider Monkey’s Q4 data, 63 hedge funds were bullish on Accenture plc (NYSE:ACN), compared to 58 funds in the last quarter. GuardCap Asset Management is the largest stakeholder of the company, with 1.4 million shares worth nearly $387 million. ClearBridge Sustainability Leaders Strategy made the following comment about Accenture plc (NYSE:ACN) in its Q4 2022 investor letter:“Accenture plc (NYSE:ACN) is a leading global professional services company that helps clients build their digital infrastructure and optimize their operations. We view Accenture as a resilient, high-quality business with consistent earnings and cash flow, a strong balance sheet and very attractive returns on capital. Secular drivers like cloud migration and digital transformation, as well as new, innovative technology deployments like data security, block chain, AI and machine learning position Accenture well for continued growth. It is also currently rolling out a suite of sustainability tools that offers a comprehensive view of a company’s goals, progress and performance across financial and ESG measures, so it is an enabler of ESG for its clients.

(NASDAQ:META)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 194Average Upside Potential Based on Analyst Ratings: 20.86%Meta AI is a research laboratory focused on artificial intelligence and is owned by Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META). The lab's primary objective is to enhance augmented and artificial reality technologies by creating different types of AI. In contrast to Facebook's Applied Machine Learning (AML) team, which concentrates on implementing practical applications of its products, Meta AI is an academic research lab that aims to generate knowledge for the wider AI community. Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) is considered to be one of the top AI stocks to invest in.On March 9, UBS reaffirmed its Buy rating on Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) and stated that the stock is still the firm's top pick in the Internet industry, as it offers both an estimate revision and multiple expansion opportunity. UBS believes recent data points have increased confidence in Meta's bull case, which it estimates at $331 per share.According to Insider Monkey’s fourth quarter database, 194 hedge funds were bullish on Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META), compared to 177 funds in the prior quarter. Boykin Curry’s Eagle Capital Management is a significant position holder in the company. Weitz Partners III Opportunity Fund made the following comment about Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) in its Q4 2022 investor letter:“Unfortunately, the performance story of the year is told by the Fund’s detractors. We’ve written at length in prior quarters about Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META)’s struggles to adapt both to changes in Apple’s iOS platform, as well as pivots to new formats like short-form video (Reels) and platform investments in the metaverse that have dragged shares lower all year.Meta, Alphabet, Amazon and CarMax were all top detractors for the quarter and calendar year periods (FIS and Liberty Broadband, respectively, complete the quarterly and calendar-year detractor lists.) To varying degrees, each is managing through cyclical challenges during a period of substantial investor pessimism. Drawdowns of this magnitude are painful, and it may be prudent for management to moderate the pace of some investments, but we remain encouraged by their long-term focus. In the short run, cutting spending indiscriminately to “defend earnings” may lessen the pain of a drawdown, but it seldom grows a company’s business value — the ultimate prize. We added to both CarMax and Meta on weakness, and all four remain core holdings.”10. ServiceNow, Inc. (NYSE:NOW)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 97Average Upside Potential Based on Analyst Ratings: 23.85%ServiceNow, Inc. (NYSE:NOW) is a California-based enterprise cloud computing company that operates the Now platform for workflow automation, artificial intelligence, machine learning, robotic process automation, process mining, performance analytics, data benchmarking, encryption, and collaboration. It is one of the best AI stocks to invest in according to analysts. In the wake of ServiceNow, Inc. (NYSE:NOW)’s Q4 earnings beat, RBC Capital analyst Matthew Hedberg raised the firm's price target on the company's shares to $510 from $500, while retaining an Outperform rating on January 26. Despite a challenging software market, the company has performed exceptionally well, according to the analyst's research note to investors. While the cRPO metric in constant currency was slightly underwhelming, the analyst believes it was mostly a timing issue. RBC Capital believes that ServiceNow's unified platform enables it to consolidate customer spending, making it a top pick for the firm in 2023.According to Insider Monkey’s fourth quarter database, 97 hedge funds were long ServiceNow, Inc. (NYSE:NOW), compared to 103 funds in the last quarter. Christopher Lyle’s SCGE Management is the largest position holder in the company. Polen Global Growth Strategy made the following comment about ServiceNow, Inc. (NYSE:NOW) in its Q4 2022 investor letter:“ServiceNow, Inc. (NYSE:NOW) is an $80 billion market cap business based in California. Its purpose is to make the world of work, work better for people. Getting a job done in an enterprise (what the company refers to as “workflow”) usually requires different people in various functions of an organization to work together. Often, they rely on different technology systems and inefficient manual processes to complete each step of the job before moving on to the next.ServiceNow believes the most effective digital transformation initiative utilizes tools that can integrate workflows across siloed systems, departments, processes, and people. The company is solving what is arguably the biggest pain point in the biggest profit pool in the world (enterprises). Consider the explosion in data growth and all the software point solutions emerging constantly. ServiceNow wrangles all this into a fully integrated dashboard on a global scale with global customers in every industry. Nearly 100% of revenues are subscription based with a 99% renewal rate, and the company currently has no direct competition, according to our research. ServiceNow started with IT workflow, and today, ~40% of net new annual contract value is in non-IT workflows. Through constant innovation, the business has continued to expand its total addressable market, and we think it can grow free cash flow (FCF) at a 20%+ annualized rate for the next three to five years. At less than 30x FCF, we thought the valuation was attractive.”9. SentinelOne, Inc. (NYSE:S)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 38Average Upside Potential Based on Analyst Ratings: 25.31%SentinelOne, Inc. (NYSE:S) is a cybersecurity provider based in Mountain View, California, which was established in 2013.

(NYSE:S) and lowered the firm's price target on the shares to $17 from $18 ahead of the company's results on March 14.According to Insider Monkey’s data, 38 hedge funds were bullish on SentinelOne, Inc. (NYSE:S) at the end of December 2022, compared to 103 funds in the prior quarter. Dan Loeb’s Third Point is the biggest position holder in the company, with 14.70 million shares worth $214.4 million. Here is what ClearBridge Investments SMID Cap Growth Strategy has to say about SentinelOne, Inc. (NYSE:S) in its Q4 2021 investor letter:“We added six new positions in the fourth quarter. We see next-generation cybersecurity provider SentinelOne, although early in its growth lifecycle, as capable of taking share from legacy players in the antivirus and broader cybersecurity industry.”8. Alteryx, Inc. (NYSE:AYX)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 45Average Upside Potential Based on Analyst Ratings: 29.66%Alteryx, Inc. (NYSE:AYX) was founded in 1997 and is headquartered in Irvine, California. It operates in the analytic process automation business in the Asia-Pacific, Europe, the Middle East, Africa, North America, and internationally. The Alteryx Analytics Automation Platform facilitates the complete automation of analytics, machine learning, artificial intelligence, and data science procedures, which expedite the process of digital transformation. It is one of the best artificial intelligence stocks to invest in. On February 10, Needham analyst Mike Cikos increased the price target on Alteryx, Inc. (NYSE:AYX) from $62 to $78 and maintained a Buy rating on the shares. This is in response to the company's Q4 earnings beat, which was impressive due to its robust execution and guidance surpassing expectations, despite the challenging macroeconomic conditions, the analyst wrote in a research note. According to Insider Monkey’s Q4 data, Alteryx, Inc. (NYSE:AYX) was part of 45 hedge fund portfolios, compared to 40 funds in the earlier quarter. Brian Bares’ Bares Capital Management is the largest stakeholder of the company, with 2.5 million shares worth $127.8 million. Here is what Brown Capital Management Small Company Fund said about Alteryx, Inc. (NYSE:AYX) in its Q3 2020 investor letter:“Alteryx provides comprehensive self-service data-analytics software to data scientists and business analysts for finding and sharing data, preparing and blending it, performing a variety of analysis, sharing insights, and automation, without the need for coding. Alteryx’s software is unique in combining a comprehensive data analytics platform with ease of use, driving dramatic improvements in business productivity and outcomes. We believe Alteryx has a large market opportunity given its ability to help data scientists as well as business analysts who have limited technical capabilities. Alteryx serves a broad base of customers across all verticals and all sizes.During the second quarter, Alteryx reported slower revenue growth relative to prior periods, and guided down full-year revenue below expectations. The revenue slowdown was partly driven by customers in certain areas that were heavily impacted by COVID-19, like small businesses and companies in the hospitality vertical, that slowed spending on new purchases and expansions. Additionally, the company noted that some customers are taking longer to make purchase decisions, extending sales cycles. These developments led to the underperformance during the third quarter. We believe the revenue slowdown is a short-term phenomenon, and continue to believe Alteryx has a large market opportunity and a long runway for multi-year growth.”7. Baidu, Inc.

(NASDAQ:BIDU) from $150 to $175 and maintained a Positive rating on the shares. The analyst acknowledged that the advertising business is still being impacted by COVID-related disruptions but remains optimistic about the company's execution. Susquehanna believes that although there is significant short-term uncertainty, Baidu, Inc. (NASDAQ:BIDU) is well-positioned as a leading player in China's search market, a key player in the feeds market, and the owner of one of the top video assets in the country. Additionally, the company is considered a market leader in AI applications, which reinforces our constructive long-term view of the stock, the analyst wrote in a research note. According to Insider Monkey’s fourth quarter database, 40 hedge funds were bullish on Baidu, Inc. (NASDAQ:BIDU), compared to 43 funds in the earlier quarter. John W. Rogers’ Ariel Investments is the biggest stakeholder of the company, with 2.85 million shares worth $326.3 million.Ariel Investment made the following comment about Baidu, Inc. (NASDAQ:BIDU) in its Q3 2022 investor letter:“China’s internet search and online community leader Baidu, Inc. (NASDAQ:BIDU) also weighed on relative results in the quarter. Continuing macro headwinds driven by China’s Zero-Covid policy are resulting in sluggish advertising trends. Looking ahead, the company remains committed to sustainable, profitable growth as management works to improve overall operational efficiency, executing on its strategic commitments around technological innovation and the transition to a green economy. We also continue to be enthusiastic about Baidu’s longer-term opportunity for revenue growth and margin expansion across internet search, cloud, autonomous driving, artificial intelligence and online video.”6.

(NASDAQ:GOOG) has been working on the development of artificial intelligence. Several of Google's most widely used products, such as Lens and Translate, were constructed entirely using AI technologies, including machine learning and optical character recognition. It is one of the best AI stocks to consider. According to Jefferies analyst Brent Thill, Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) has a significant advantage in the field of large language AI models due to the quality of its data, which is derived from its widespread usage of Search, Chrome, and Android. Jefferies maintains a positive view on Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG)’s AI capabilities and does not anticipate any significant financial impact from AI for either Alphabet or Microsoft in the near future. The firm has reasserted its Buy rating and a $130 price target on Alphabet Inc.

(NASDAQ:GOOG), compared to 156 funds in the prior quarter. Chris Hohn’s TCI Fund Management is the biggest stakeholder of the company, with 54.5 million shares worth $4.8 billion. In addition to Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), Snowflake Inc.

248,4eec4dc8-aabd-354c-866a-84fe61716f4c,MCD,2023-03-14,Possible bearish signals as McDonald's Corporation (NYSE:MCD) insiders disposed of US$3.7m worth of stock,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/possible-bearish-signals-mcdonalds-corporation-120037438.html,1678795237,STORY,['MCD'],"[Over the past year, many McDonald's Corporation (NYSE:MCD) insiders sold a significant stake in the company which may have piqued investors' interest. Knowing whether insiders are buying is usually more helpful when evaluating insider transactions, as insider selling can have various explanations. However, if numerous insiders are selling, shareholders should investigate more.Although we don't think shareholders should simply follow insider transactions, we would consider it foolish to ignore insider transactions altogether. See our latest analysis for McDonald's McDonald's Insider Transactions Over The Last YearOver the last year, we can see that the biggest insider sale was by the Executive VP &amp; CFO, Ian Borden, for US$2.0m worth of shares, at about US$256 per share. So it's clear an insider wanted to take some cash off the table, even below the current price of US$263. When an insider sells below the current price, it suggests that they considered that lower price to be fair. That makes us wonder what they think of the (higher) recent valuation. Please do note, however, that sellers may have a variety of reasons for selling, so we don't know for sure what they think of the stock price. It is worth noting that this sale was 53% of Ian Borden's holding.McDonald's insiders didn't buy any shares over the last year. The chart below shows insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last year. If you want to know exactly who sold, for how much, and when, simply click on the graph below!insider-trading-volumeI will like McDonald's better if I see some big insider buys. While we wait, check out this free list of growing companies with considerable, recent, insider buying.Insider Ownership Of McDonald'sFor a common shareholder, it is worth checking how many shares are held by company insiders. Usually, the higher the insider ownership, the more likely it is that insiders will be incentivised to build the company for the long term. It appears that McDonald's insiders own 0.04% of the company, worth about US$84m. We've certainly seen higher levels of insider ownership elsewhere, but these holdings are enough to suggest alignment between insiders and the other shareholders.Story continuesSo What Do The McDonald's Insider Transactions Indicate?The fact that there have been no McDonald's insider transactions recently certainly doesn't bother us. Still, the insider transactions at McDonald's in the last 12 months are not very heartening. The modest level of insider ownership is, at least, some comfort. So these insider transactions can help us build a thesis about the stock, but it's also worthwhile knowing the risks facing this company. Case in point: We've spotted 1 warning sign for McDonald's you should be aware of.Of course McDonald's may not be the best stock to buy. So you may wish to see this free collection of high quality companies.For the purposes of this article, insiders are those individuals who report their transactions to the relevant regulatory body.

The company is gaining from strong growth of artificial intelligence, high-performance computing and accelerated computing, which is boosting its Compute &amp; Networking revenues. A surge in Hyperscale demand and a solid uptake of artificial intelligence-based smart cockpit infotainment solutions are acting as tailwinds.Collaboration with Mercedes-Benz and Audi is likely to advance its presence in autonomous vehicles and other automotive electronics space. The Zacks analyst expects its Automotive segment's revenue to grow at a CAGR of 50% through fiscal 2023-2025.However, NVDA's near-term prospects look gloomy due to weakening demand for chips used in gaming and data center end markets. While macroeconomic headwinds are impacting gaming and data center chip demand, higher channel inventory levels are hurting chip prices.(You can read the full research report on NVIDIA here &gt;&gt;&gt;)McDonald's shares have outperformed the Zacks Retail - Restaurants industry over the past year (+15.3% vs. +12.9%).

Of course, one figure often stands out among the rest: earnings.The earnings figure itself is key, but a beat or miss on the bottom line can sometimes be just as, if not more, important. Therefore, investors should consider paying close attention to these earnings surprises, as a big beat can help a stock climb even higher.2 Stocks to Add to Your WatchlistThe Zacks Expected Surprise Prediction, or ESP, works by locking in on the most up-to-date analyst earnings revisions because they can be more accurate than estimates from weeks or even months before the actual release date. The thinking is pretty straightforward: analysts who provide earnings estimates closer to the report are likely to have more information. With this in mind, the Expected Surprise Prediction compares the Most Accurate Estimate (being the most recent) against the overall Zacks Consensus Estimate. The percentage difference provides the ESP figure.The last thing we will do today, now that we have a grasp on the ESP and how powerful of a tool it can be, is to look at a qualifying stock. Delta Air Lines (DAL) holds a Zacks Rank #3 at the moment and its Most Accurate Estimate comes in at $0.37 a share 30 days away from its upcoming earnings release on April 12, 2023.By taking the percentage difference between the $0.37 Most Accurate Estimate and the $0.32 Zacks Consensus Estimate, Delta Air Lines has an Earnings ESP of 16.03%.DAL is just one of a large group of Transportation stocks with a positive ESP figure. United Parcel Service (UPS) is another qualifying stock you may want to consider.Slated to report earnings on April 25, 2023, United Parcel Service holds a #3 (Hold) ranking on the Zacks Rank, and it's Most Accurate Estimate is $2.31 a share 43 days from its next quarterly update.United Parcel Service's Earnings ESP figure currently stands at 3.36% after taking the percentage difference between its Most Accurate Estimate and its Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.23.Story continuesDAL and UPS' positive ESP figures tell us that both stocks have a good chance at beating analyst expectations in their next earnings report.Find Stocks to Buy or Sell Before They're ReportedUse the Zacks Earnings ESP Filter to turn up stocks with the highest probability of positively, or negatively, surprising to buy or sell before they're reported for profitable earnings season trading.

(NASDAQ:NTAP) Potentially Undervalued?",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/netapp-inc-nasdaq-ntap-potentially-102422396.html,1678789462,STORY,['NTAP'],"[Today we're going to take a look at the well-established NetApp, Inc. (NASDAQ:NTAP). The company's stock saw significant share price movement during recent months on the NASDAQGS, rising to highs of US$69.05 and falling to the lows of US$58.18. Some share price movements can give investors a better opportunity to enter into the stock, and potentially buy at a lower price. A question to answer is whether NetApp's current trading price of US$61.35 reflective of the actual value of the large-cap? Or is it currently undervalued, providing us with the opportunity to buy? Let’s take a look at NetApp’s outlook and value based on the most recent financial data to see if there are any catalysts for a price change. See our latest analysis for NetApp Is NetApp Still Cheap?Great news for investors – NetApp is still trading at a fairly cheap price. According to my valuation, the intrinsic value for the stock is $93.89, which is above what the market is valuing the company at the moment. This indicates a potential opportunity to buy low. What’s more interesting is that, NetApp’s share price is quite volatile, which gives us more chances to buy since the share price could sink lower (or rise higher) in the future. This is based on its high beta, which is a good indicator for how much the stock moves relative to the rest of the market.What does the future of NetApp look like?earnings-and-revenue-growthFuture outlook is an important aspect when you’re looking at buying a stock, especially if you are an investor looking for growth in your portfolio. Buying a great company with a robust outlook at a cheap price is always a good investment, so let’s also take a look at the company's future expectations. However, with an extremely negative double-digit change in profit expected over the next couple of years, near-term growth is certainly not a driver of a buy decision. It seems like high uncertainty is on the cards for NetApp, at least in the near future.What This Means For YouAre you a shareholder? Although NTAP is currently undervalued, the negative outlook does bring on some uncertainty, which equates to higher risk. Consider whether you want to increase your portfolio exposure to NTAP, or whether diversifying into another stock may be a better move for your total risk and return.Story continuesAre you a potential investor? If you’ve been keeping tabs on NTAP for some time, but hesitant on making the leap, I recommend you research further into the stock. Given its current undervaluation, now is a great time to make a decision. But keep in mind the risks that come with negative growth prospects in the future.If you'd like to know more about NetApp as a business, it's important to be aware of any risks it's facing.

For more companies, head on over to 10 Largest Software Companies in the World by Revenue. Hardware and software are the building blocks of modern day technology. Both have to work hand in hand, and generally speaking, hardware often ends up lagging software when it comes to product development. This is due to the fact that it takes years to develop hardware from the design process to the actual chip fabrication which often requires making the machines themselves in the most advanced cases, while in the case of software, development is relatively easier since it involves iterative upgrades to smooth out any bugs and introduce new features.The global software market is also one of the biggest in the world and also one that comes with higher margins since the product costs are lower. According to research from Sky Quest, the global software market was worth $547 billion in 2021 and will grow to $872 billion by 2028 through a compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) of 7.2%. The research firm believes that emerging trends such as artificial intelligence and the internet of things (IoT) have the potential to drive the market forward, with the fastest growing segment being the one in which no coding is required and the largest segment being one where there is low code required. It adds that the no code segment will outpace the broader industry significantly in growth percentage, as it is expected to exhibit a faster growth rate of 27.6% over the same time period.All anyone can talk about these days is the growth of artificial intelligence and the use of ChatGPT for all sorts of applications, from writing to making assignments, and even writing code. However, while for the general public, using code itself to write code seems to be a novel concept, the fact is that this practice has been around for years. Starting from ChatGPT though, the bot is shown to be able to write simple Java, Python, and React code, alongside also providing conversational feedback receiving capability to admit its mistakes and improve on them. Using code to write code that then writes codes is called Metaprogramming in computer science. This practice has a multi decade history, and the first programming language capable to do so was the programming language Lisp which was introduced in 1958.Story continuesAs far as 2023 goes, there are several trends that will be important this year according to the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT). These include the growing use of robotics in business processes and operations, blockchain technologies, the Internet of Things (IoT), and advanced N3-E semiconductors fabricated by the Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (NYSE:TSM).Today, we'll look at some of the largest software companies in the world with the top picks being Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), Alphabet Inc.

The Zacks Consensus Estimate was of a profit of 3 cents. The underperformance was due to higher total costs and other expenses.However, the loss was narrower than the year-ago quarter’s loss of 12 cents per share. The improvement was due to better-than-expected performances from the Subsea and Surface Technologies segments.Adjusted EBITDA from the Subsea unit for the reported quarter totaled $140.1 million, narrowly beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $140 million. Surface Technologies’ profit came in at $44.4 million, outperforming the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $42.15 million.For the quarter ended Dec 31, this subsea-to-surface oilfield equipment and services provider’s revenues of $1.7 billion marginally outperformed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.6 billion. This was primarily due to a higher revenue contribution from the Subsea segment. Revenues also increased from the year-ago quarter’s $1.5 billion.FTI’s fourth-quarter inbound orders increased 19.6% from the year-ago period’s level to $8 billion, reflecting strong revenue visibility. The company’s backlog also increased.

This increase was due to higher project installation activity.Adjusted EBITDA came in at $140.1 million, up about 13.3% from the year-ago quarter’s level. This was due to improved margins in the backlog and increased installation activity. The quarterly inbound orders jumped 46.5% to $1.5 billion, while the backlog rose 24.5%.Surface Technologies:  This segment recorded revenues of $351.9 million, up 22.6 % year over year. The improvement was mainly driven by higher sales across the world, especially in the Middle East where growth exceeded 70%.Story continuesMoreover, the unit’s adjusted EBITDA increased 53.6% to $44.4 million. This was due to higher international activity, including the progressive ramp-up in the Middle East volume and the timing of associated costs.However, the segment’s inbound orders decreased 69.5% after increasing in the previous quarter. The quarter-end backlog increased 8.6%.FinancialsIn the reported quarter, TechnipFMC spent $63.6 million on capital expenditures. As of Dec 31, the company had cash and cash equivalents of $1.1 billion and long-term debt of $999.3 million, with a debt-to-capitalization of 23.6%.2023 OutlookTechnipFMC’s revenue expectations from the Subsea and Surface Technologies segments are in the $5.9-$6.3 billion and $1.3-$1.45 billion range, respectively, for 2023.This London-based oilfield services provider anticipates free cash flow in the $225-375 million range for the same year.The company’s annual capital expenditure guidance for the year is $250 million.

Using the most recent financial data, we'll take a look at whether the stock is fairly priced by taking the expected future cash flows and discounting them to their present value. We will use the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model on this occasion. It may sound complicated, but actually it is quite simple!We generally believe that a company's value is the present value of all of the cash it will generate in the future. However, a DCF is just one valuation metric among many, and it is not without flaws. If you still have some burning questions about this type of valuation, take a look at the Simply Wall St analysis model. View our latest analysis for Boston Scientific The CalculationWe use what is known as a 2-stage model, which simply means we have two different periods of growth rates for the company's cash flows. Generally the first stage is higher growth, and the second stage is a lower growth phase. In the first stage we need to estimate the cash flows to the business over the next ten years. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.A DCF is all about the idea that a dollar in the future is less valuable than a dollar today, so we discount the value of these future cash flows to their estimated value in today's dollars:Story continues10-year free cash flow (FCF) forecast2023202420252026202720282029203020312032 Levered FCF ($, Millions) US$2.12bUS$2.76bUS$3.25bUS$3.42bUS$3.83bUS$4.13bUS$4.38bUS$4.59bUS$4.77bUS$4.94bGrowth Rate Estimate SourceAnalyst x6Analyst x5Analyst x3Analyst x2Analyst x1Est @ 7.77%Est @ 6.06%Est @ 4.86%Est @ 4.03%Est @ 3.44% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 7.6% US$2.0kUS$2.4kUS$2.6kUS$2.5kUS$2.7kUS$2.7kUS$2.6kUS$2.6kUS$2.5kUS$2.4k(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$25bAfter calculating the present value of future cash flows in the initial 10-year period, we need to calculate the Terminal Value, which accounts for all future cash flows beyond the first stage. For a number of reasons a very conservative growth rate is used that cannot exceed that of a country's GDP growth. In this case we have used the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield (2.1%) to estimate future growth. In the same way as with the 10-year 'growth' period, we discount future cash flows to today's value, using a cost of equity of 7.6%.Terminal Value (TV)= FCF2032 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$4.9b× (1 + 2.1%) ÷ (7.6%– 2.1%) = US$91bPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$91b÷ ( 1 + 7.6%)10= US$44bThe total value is the sum of cash flows for the next ten years plus the discounted terminal value, which results in the Total Equity Value, which in this case is US$68b. The last step is to then divide the equity value by the number of shares outstanding. Relative to the current share price of US$47.6, the company appears about fair value at a 0.2% discount to where the stock price trades currently. Valuations are imprecise instruments though, rather like a telescope - move a few degrees and end up in a different galaxy. Do keep this in mind.dcfThe AssumptionsThe calculation above is very dependent on two assumptions. The first is the discount rate and the other is the cash flows. You don't have to agree with these inputs, I recommend redoing the calculations yourself and playing with them. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Boston Scientific as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 7.6%, which is based on a levered beta of 0.934. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.SWOT Analysis for Boston ScientificStrengthDebt is well covered by earnings.WeaknessEarnings declined over the past year.OpportunityAnnual earnings are forecast to grow faster than the American market.Current share price is below our estimate of fair value.ThreatDebt is not well covered by operating cash flow.Annual revenue is forecast to grow slower than the American market.Next Steps:Whilst important, the DCF calculation is only one of many factors that you need to assess for a company. The DCF model is not a perfect stock valuation tool. Rather it should be seen as a guide to ""what assumptions need to be true for this stock to be under/overvalued?"" For example, changes in the company's cost of equity or the risk free rate can significantly impact the valuation.

Therefore, you might want to consider some of the key factors that could influence the stock's performance in the near future.Shares of this beauty products retailer have returned +1.1% over the past month versus the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's -5.4% change. The Zacks Retail - Miscellaneous industry, to which Ulta belongs, has lost 2.2% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?While media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.Revisions to Earnings EstimatesRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.Our analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.Ulta is expected to post earnings of $6.61 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +4.9%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed +2.4%.The consensus earnings estimate of $24.67 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of +2.8%. This estimate has changed +4.3% over the last 30 days.Story continuesFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $26.84 indicates a change of +8.8% from what Ulta is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed +1.9%.Having a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, Ulta is rated Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPS12-month consensus EPS estimate for ULTA _12MonthEPSChartUrlRevenue Growth ForecastWhile earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.In the case of Ulta, the consensus sales estimate of $2.49 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of +6%. The $11.03 billion and $11.38 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of +8.1% and +3.1%, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryUlta reported revenues of $3.23 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +18.2%. EPS of $6.68 for the same period compares with $5.41 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $3.04 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +6.22%. The EPS surprise was +17.4%.The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.ValuationWithout considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.Comparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.As part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.Ulta is graded B on this front, indicating that it is trading at a discount to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.ConclusionThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Ulta. However, its Zacks Rank #2 does suggest that it may outperform the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

You can skip our detailed analysis of dividend stocks and their historical performance, and go directly to read 5 Under-the-Radar High Dividend Stocks to Buy. The global economy has take a massive hit last year due to elevated inflation, rising interest rates and geopolitical uncertainty. The world economy is slowing as IMF forecasted global growth to slow to 2.3% this year from 6% in 2021 and 3.2% last year. Analysts and economists have also hinted toward the possible financial crisis in 2023. In the US, 24% of economists surveyed by the World Economic Forum expect high inflation this year, whereas 91% expect weak economic growth. The sizzling inflation and the risks of a possible recession have altered investor sentiment.Considering the current market situation and investment scenarios, analysts recommend putting money in dividend stocks as they have the ability to open up regular income channels for investors. David Rosenberg of Rosenberg Research and Associates spoke to MarketWatch about possible investment strategies in the high-interest rates period in February. He mentioned that investors should focus on defensive sectors of the financial markets, including dividend-paying stocks. He further said that dividend companies with strong balance sheets and dividend payouts endure periods of financial volatility better than their peers.Many other reports conform to Rosenberg’s analysis, revealing the strong performance of dividend stocks in high-interest rates periods. According to iShares, the S&amp;P 500 Dividend Payers fell by 7.6% last year, compared with a 21.1% decline in the S&amp;P 500 Non-Dividend Payers. The report also mentioned that in the 1940s and the 1907s, when inflation was at its record high, dividends contributed 53% and 50% of the stock market’s total return. Another report by Nuveen throws light on the importance of high-dividend stocks and how healthy dividend yields generate better returns for shareholders. According to the report, dividend payers with yields above 3% delivered an annual average return of 8.1% in 2022, versus a 6.7% return of the MSCI World Index.Story continuesDividend investing usually brings well-known companies into focus.

277,88ff9a19-4ec2-3547-82ab-4b0fec43345f,KO,2023-03-14,5 Safe Stocks to Buy as SVB Collapse Shakes Wall Street,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/5-safe-stocks-buy-svb-140402030.html,1678716242,STORY,"['SIVB', 'KO', 'GIS', 'CAH', 'CLX']","[Wall Street closed sharply lower last week following the collapse of the biggest regional bank. The Dow slid 4.4%, marking its biggest weekly decline since June 2022. The S&amp;P 500 shed 4.6%, reflecting its largest weekly drop since September 2022. The Nasdaq Composite tumbled 4.7%, posting the single-largest weekly fall since November 2022.On Mar 10, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. (FDIC) announced that regulators closed Silicon Valley Bank (SVB) and took control of its deposits. This was the biggest bank failure in the United States since the collapse of Washington Mutual in 2008 and the second-biggest bank failure in the nation’s history.The privately controlled Silicon Valley Bank is a subsidiary of the SVB Financial Group (SIVB). The 40-year-old highly respected regional bank, which lends primarily to technology and biotechnology startups, was the first major victim of the aggressive interest rate hike policies adopted by the Fed to combat record-high inflation. The collapse of SVB resulted in a nearly 16% drop in the SPDR S&amp;P Regional Banking ETF (KRE), last week.SVB Becomes First Major Victim of Aggressive Rate HikeThe SVB was a highly recognized brand lending to startups as well as venture capitals and private equities. Due to rigorous rate hikes by the Fed in the past year to combat record-high inflation, the startup companies find it extremely difficult to raise funds either through IPO or private investment.Startup clients of SVB withdrew deposits with the bank in order to keep their business running. As a result, SVB became short of capital. On Mar 8, SVB announced that it needed to raise at least $2.25 billion immediately as the bank was compelled to sell all of its available-for-sale bonds at a $1.75 billion loss.This situation triggered a panic in the venture capitalist community, especially among those who have invested in startups that are clients of SVB. Once the venture capitalists instructed their clients to withdraw deposits from SVB, a staggering $42 billion in deposits were removed by the end of Mar 9. SVB had a negative cash balance of $958 million. The bank failed to find a buyer, finally prompting the regulators to take control of its deposits.Story continuesBroad-Market May Face Domino EffectA large section of economists and financial experts have warned the Federal Government to immediately find a buyer for SVB or else the ripple effect of the bank’s failure will shake the broad market. Nearly 95% of SVB’s deposits are uninsured, and most of the money comes  from the bank’s startup clients. These startup companies will find it difficult to pay their employees this month.On Mar 9, Silvergate Capital Corp. (SI), a major lender to the crypto industry, announced that it would be shutting down operations and liquidating its bank. Moreover, Circle Internet Financial Ltd., has $3.3 billion of reserves held at SVB. The company is the issuer of the crypto’s second-largest stablecoin, the USDC.Market participants are highly concerned that the collapse of SVB will significantly dent the confidence of U.S. small and mid-sized banks. The SVB takes centerstage, providing seed capital, which is extremely important for early-stage startups. Following the collapse of SVB, venture capitalists and private equities will be under pressure to raise more capital.Our Top PicksAt this juncture, it will be prudent to stay with safe stocks. We use five selection criteria to find safe stocks. Fist, low-beta (beta &gt;0 &lt;1) stocks with market capital &gt; $10 billion.

(NASDAQ: INTU), the global financial technology platform that makes TurboTax, Credit Karma, QuickBooks, and Mailchimp, has launched the Intuit QuickBooks Small Business Index, a powerful new monthly indicator of employment and hiring among small businesses in Canada, the US, and the UK developed in collaboration with leading global economist Professor Ufuk Akcigit.This press release features multimedia. View the full release here: https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20230314005526/en/(Photo: Business Wire)The Intuit QuickBooks Small Business Index uses purpose-built economic models to normalize anonymized QuickBooks customer data against official government statistics to reflect the general population of small businesses in each country; it is not a reflection of Intuit’s business. This robust methodology expands Intuit’s ability to more clearly delineate between Intuit’s small business customers and the small business community at large, while also providing a powerful new tool that can inform government policies that impact small businesses around the globe, as well as to help small businesses make key decisions.The Index’s primary benefit is its unparalleled focus on small businesses, which are vital to the current and future health of the economy but often underrepresented in economic data. By shining a brighter light on small businesses with timely insights, Intuit hopes to increase small business growth and success rates throughout Canada, the US, and the UK.Sasan Goodarzi, Intuit’s Chief Executive Officer, said: ""Up-to-date insights like those now available through our index will be invaluable to anyone focused on the success of small businesses, especially in the face of increasingly challenging economic conditions. We’re excited for this unique index to become a key tool economists, policymakers, and small businesses themselves can use in making decisions that will help power small business prosperity around the world.""Story continuesFRESH INSIGHTS ON CANADIAN SMALL BUSINESS EMPLOYMENTEmployment and hiring data is the bellwether for the overall economic health of Canada and the first monthly Index reveals:In February, small businesses with one to 19 employees employed 8,700 fewer people (seasonally adjusted) nationally compared to the previous month, which is a monthly decrease of 0.17 per cent. Despite the drop, Canadian small businesses with one to 19 employees still accounted for 5,201,500 jobs.Sectors that experienced the largest decreases in employment in Canada were Finance and Real Estate (-0.43 per cent), Construction (−0.26 per cent), and Professional Services (−0.17 per cent) while employment increased in Accommodation and Food Services (2.45 per cent), Education (1.19 per cent) and Business Services (1.16 per cent).The region which saw the most growth was Québec, growing by 0.91 per cent to 1,070,500 jobs. However, Ontario saw the largest decrease, with a drop of -0.29 per cent to 1,917,100 jobs.Renowned global economist, and Arnold C. Harberger Professor of Economics at the University of Chicago Ufuk Akcigit said: ""In Canada, our Intuit QuickBooks Small Business Index is a measurement of small businesses with 1-19 employees. The Index reveals a drop of -0.17 per cent in small business employment in February compared to January 2023. When looking back year-over-year, we see that the decline in employment has slowed in comparison to February 2022, where employment declined by -0.4 per cent. Small businesses experienced a record monthly employment drop by -21 per cent in April 2020 due to COVID-19. This monumental decline was met with a rapid recovery one year later that reached pre-COVID average employment levels in April 2021, which continued until September 2021.""It’s encouraging to see that the Intuit QuickBooks Small Business Index indicates that employment levels have remained relatively stable over the past six quarters. As small businesses continue to play a vital role in the Canadian labour market, it makes it even more important we now have a tool like the Intuit QuickBooks Small Business Index that will focus on unearthing timely insights into their overall employment health and within specific sectors and regions.""David Marquis, Vice President and Canada Country Manager, at Intuit, added: ""Our new Intuit QuickBooks Small Business Index draws on a sizable sample, providing a prompt and precise representation of the economic health of small businesses in Canada. These critical insights can serve as a single source of truth to help facilitate a productive dialogue among small business owners and policy makers to ensure the backbone of our economy continues to thrive. The number of small businesses, the jobs they create, and the innovations they bring make them vitally important to the economy. By keeping a monthly pulse on the health of small businesses, we are able to provide rich insights to power their survival, growth and prosperity.""NEW INSIGHTS PUBLISHED MONTHLYNew data insights will be added to the Intuit QuickBooks Small Business Index dashboard and published in regular blog posts at the earliest opportunity every month. To subscribe, and get a full list of publication dates for 2023, visit the Intuit QuickBooks Small Business Index interactive hub.In Canada, the Intuit QuickBooks Small Business Index shows the number of people employed by small businesses with 1-19 employees in the previous month and how that number has changed since the month before. These data insights are available at the national, regional, and sector levels; based on a total sample of almost 66,000 businesses. Typically, the Index will be published several days before Statistics Canada's Labour Force Survey is released.In the US, the Index shows the number of people employed by small businesses with 1-9 employees in the previous month and how that number has changed since the month before. These data insights are available at the national, regional, state (when sample sizes are sufficient), and sector levels; based on a total sample of almost 333,000 businesses. Because the Index is powered by anonymized data from QuickBooks Online Payroll, its data insights are available up to nine months earlier than equivalent official statistics, giving a more up-to-date picture of small business employment.In the UK, the Intuit QuickBooks Small Business Index shows the number of job vacancies at small businesses with 1-9 employees in the previous month and how that number has changed since the month before. These data insights are available at the national (UK), country (England, Wales, Scotland, Northern Ireland), and sector levels; based on a total sample of almost 25,000 businesses. Typically, the Index will be published around two weeks before the Office for National Statistics’ monthly Vacancy Survey is released.ROBUST METHODOLOGYThe Index methodology is robust and stands out from other reports in the market by being calibrated against official statistics and focusing exclusively on small businesses while also eliminating publication delays. Unlike other small business indexes, it does not rely exclusively on survey data. Instead, a sample of anonymized QuickBooks Online Payroll records are aggregated and normalized against official government statistics before publication using purpose-built economic models created by Professor Akcigit and his international team of independent economists. This means the Index can provide a near real-time reflection of hiring and employment in the broader small business economy — rather than the QuickBooks customer base — just a few days after small businesses run payroll.Visit the Intuit QuickBooks Small Business Index interactive hub for further insights and to stay up to date on the latest Index releases.Notes to EditorsMETHODOLOGYThe Intuit QuickBooks Small Business Index creates aggregated data outputs from anonymized QuickBooks Online Payroll customer records which are calibrated using statistical methods to better reflect the general population of small businesses in each country, as represented by published official statistics. Statistical adjustment ensures the Index truly reflects employment and job vacancy changes rather than changes in the QuickBooks customer base. Get the full methodology on the Intuit QuickBooks Small Business Index interactive hub.Rounded valuesTotal and monthly changes in employment and job vacancies have been rounded to the nearest hundred. Monthly changes and growth rates are calculated before total employment or job vacancy values are rounded. Rates have been rounded to the nearest hundredth.Seasonal adjustmentsThe Index’s data insights are seasonally adjusted to limit the effect of seasonal patterns in employment and hiring throughout the year, which lead to regular fluctuations in workforce growth and contraction.Time seriesThe Index uses data going back to January 2015 in the US and Canada and January 2018 in the UK. Published at the earliest opportunity every month, it shows the number of people employed by small businesses (US and Canada) or the number of job vacancies at small businesses (UK) in the previous month and how that number has changed since the month before. So, in March, the Index shows total employment or job vacancies in February and the monthly growth rate — up or down — compared to January. It helps to eliminate almost all of the time lags in official statistics — of 7-9 months in the US, of several days in Canada, and up to 2 weeks in the UK — by providing estimated projections of what those statistics will ultimately show when they are published.Sample sizes and target populationsThe total sample across all three countries is around 424,000 small businesses. The US sample is almost 333,000 small businesses. The Canadian sample is almost 66,000 small businesses. The UK sample is almost 25,000 small businesses. In the US and UK, the Index reflects the population of small businesses with one to nine employees, while in Canada it reflects small businesses with one to 19 employees. The differences in target populations ensure the data insights are consistent with official statistics available for benchmarking during the calibration process. Data insights for these target populations are particularly valuable since most datasets fail to cover this portion of the economy well. Please note: Unlike the US and Canada Indexes, the UK Index uses job vacancy data for calibration rather than employment data because official employment statistics are not currently available on a monthly basis for small businesses.External data sourcesExternal data sources used alongside anonymized QuickBooks data include:US Bureau of Labor Statistics Business Employment Dynamics (BED) and Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey (JOLTS)US Bureau of Economic Analysis regionsStatistics Canada Labour Force Survey and regionsUK Office of National Statistics job vacancy dataABOUT PROFESSOR UFUK AKCIGITUfuk Akcigit is the Arnold C.

That’s a monthly decrease of -2.5% to 150,200 job vacancies.Sectors that experienced the largest drop in job vacancies in the UK were: finance and insurance (-6.88%); accommodation and food services (-5.94%); administrative and support services (-5.93%). The education sector stood out as the only sector which saw an increase in job vacancies – an increase of 1.68% to 15,900 job vacancies.Wales saw the largest decrease in the UK, with a drop of -7.35% to 5,000 job vacancies. Northern Ireland saw the smallest decrease, with a drop of -1.71% to 2,300 job vacancies.Renowned global economist, and Arnold C. Harberger Professor of Economics at the University of Chicago Ufuk Akcigit said: ""Intuit QuickBooks Small Business Index shows that the UK economy had -2.5% less vacancies compared to the previous month. Despite the decline, last month’s vacancy numbers are 29% higher than the pre-pandemic period. Since a peak in March 2022, there’s been a steady decline of -2.4% per month on average in job vacancies, and the most recent index shows the decline continued this month at almost the same average pace.""Job vacancies in small businesses experienced a sharp decline starting in April 2020 due to COVID-19 and reached its minimum level in June 2020. Then the UK economy entered into a massive expansion episode for small businesses for seven consecutive quarters until March 2022. This was an important episode for small businesses where the number of vacancies increased by 4.4 times.""The Index provides an important new perspective on the small business economy – which are critical to employment, growth and innovation in the UK. Young and small businesses are the fresh bloods that rejuvenate the UK economy by producing disproportionately more employment growth and innovation. It’s encouraging to see that vacancy numbers of firms with one to nine workers, which are closely tied to their employment levels, are well above the pre-COVID levels and small businesses are becoming an even larger part of the UK economy.""Jolawn Victor, Vice President and UK Country Manager, at Intuit QuickBooks, added: ""We’re thrilled to provide this barometer on vacancies, so the small business community and policymakers alike have the tools to make key decisions. By protecting and nurturing small businesses now, we help them become the superstar firms of the future.

This style score condenses all the essential metrics from a company’s financial statements to get a true sense of the quality and sustainability of its growth. The company has a long-term expected earnings per share growth rate of 15%.Factors That Augur WellInsperity’s business is currently benefiting from strength in the professional employer organization or the PEO industry. This strength is being driven by the growth of small and medium-sized businesses, the increased need of providing employee benefits and workplace safety programs, as well as the related expenses, time and knowledge required to attain the technology infrastructure to administer benefits, HR and payroll processing on an integrated basis.Insperity’s top-line growth is directly proportional to the rise in the average number of worksite employees paid per month. In 2022, total revenues of $5.9 billion increased 19.4% year over year on the back of a 1.5% rise in revenues per worksite employee and a 17.7% jump in paid worksite employees.

Today, we will estimate the stock's intrinsic value by taking the expected future cash flows and discounting them to today's value. This will be done using the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model. Before you think you won't be able to understand it, just read on! It's actually much less complex than you'd imagine.Remember though, that there are many ways to estimate a company's value, and a DCF is just one method. If you want to learn more about discounted cash flow, the rationale behind this calculation can be read in detail in the Simply Wall St analysis model. Check out our latest analysis for Sempra Energy The ModelAs Sempra Energy operates in the integrated utilities sector, we need to calculate the intrinsic value slightly differently. Instead of using free cash flows, which are hard to estimate and often not reported by analysts in this industry, dividends per share (DPS) payments are used. This often underestimates the value of a stock, but it can still be good as a comparison to competitors. We use the Gordon Growth Model, which assumes dividend will grow into perpetuity at a rate that can be sustained. For a number of reasons a very conservative growth rate is used that cannot exceed that of a company's Gross Domestic Product (GDP). In this case we used the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield (2.1%). The expected dividend per share is then discounted to today's value at a cost of equity of 6.8%. Relative to the current share price of US$144, the company appears slightly overvalued at the time of writing. Valuations are imprecise instruments though, rather like a telescope - move a few degrees and end up in a different galaxy. Do keep this in mind.Story continuesValue Per Share = Expected Dividend Per Share / (Discount Rate - Perpetual Growth Rate)= US$5.3 / (6.8% – 2.1%)= US$111dcfImportant AssumptionsNow the most important inputs to a discounted cash flow are the discount rate, and of course, the actual cash flows. If you don't agree with these result, have a go at the calculation yourself and play with the assumptions. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Sempra Energy as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 6.8%, which is based on a levered beta of 0.800. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.SWOT Analysis for Sempra EnergyStrengthEarnings growth over the past year exceeded the industry.WeaknessInterest payments on debt are not well covered.Dividend is low compared to the top 25% of dividend payers in the Integrated Utilities market.OpportunityAnnual earnings are forecast to grow for the next 3 years.Good value based on P/E ratio compared to estimated Fair P/E ratio.ThreatDebt is not well covered by operating cash flow.Paying a dividend but company has no free cash flows.Annual earnings are forecast to grow slower than the American market.Next Steps:Although the valuation of a company is important, it is only one of many factors that you need to assess for a company. DCF models are not the be-all and end-all of investment valuation. Preferably you'd apply different cases and assumptions and see how they would impact the company's valuation. For instance, if the terminal value growth rate is adjusted slightly, it can dramatically alter the overall result. Can we work out why the company is trading at a premium to intrinsic value?

Revenues from gas exports came in at $8.4 billion, up 30.4% from the fourth quarter of 2021 and 0.3% above the Zacks Consensus Estimate.The company’s fourth-quarter adjusted EBITDA was $3.1 billion, with distributable cash flow (DCF) of around $2.3 billion.

As a result, the company hiked its dividend and announced plans to buy back an additional $2.75 billion of shareholder stock.However, BP provoked environmentalists by receding from its plans to cut hydrocarbon production and reduce emissions by 2030. According to BP’s annual report, the company’s emissions in 2022 remained unchanged from the previous year at around 340 million tons of carbon dioxide equivalent.BP has already achieved its target to reduce well-to-forecourt emissions by 10-15% by 2025 against a 2019 baseline. Despite increasing its hydrocarbon production through 2025, BP intends to cut the well-to-forecourt emissions by 20-30% by 2030 and achieve net zero emissions by 2050. It plans to reduce its hydrocarbon production by 25% by 2030.Oil giants’ massive profits and big salaries for top executives have urged energy companies to do more to protect consumers from high energy prices, which have fueled higher inflation and increased utility bills. As oil and gas bosses are sweeping millions in bonuses, families are struggling to heat their homes.Hence, activist groups and some opposition lawmakers in Britain demanded expanded taxes on the windfall profits of energy companies and taxing bonuses.Price PerformanceShares of BP have outperformed the industry in the past six months.

You can skip our detailed analysis of dividend stocks and their historical performance, and go directly to read 5 Under-the-Radar High Dividend Stocks to Buy. The global economy has take a massive hit last year due to elevated inflation, rising interest rates and geopolitical uncertainty. The world economy is slowing as IMF forecasted global growth to slow to 2.3% this year from 6% in 2021 and 3.2% last year. Analysts and economists have also hinted toward the possible financial crisis in 2023. In the US, 24% of economists surveyed by the World Economic Forum expect high inflation this year, whereas 91% expect weak economic growth. The sizzling inflation and the risks of a possible recession have altered investor sentiment.Considering the current market situation and investment scenarios, analysts recommend putting money in dividend stocks as they have the ability to open up regular income channels for investors. David Rosenberg of Rosenberg Research and Associates spoke to MarketWatch about possible investment strategies in the high-interest rates period in February. He mentioned that investors should focus on defensive sectors of the financial markets, including dividend-paying stocks. He further said that dividend companies with strong balance sheets and dividend payouts endure periods of financial volatility better than their peers.Many other reports conform to Rosenberg’s analysis, revealing the strong performance of dividend stocks in high-interest rates periods. According to iShares, the S&amp;P 500 Dividend Payers fell by 7.6% last year, compared with a 21.1% decline in the S&amp;P 500 Non-Dividend Payers. The report also mentioned that in the 1940s and the 1907s, when inflation was at its record high, dividends contributed 53% and 50% of the stock market’s total return. Another report by Nuveen throws light on the importance of high-dividend stocks and how healthy dividend yields generate better returns for shareholders. According to the report, dividend payers with yields above 3% delivered an annual average return of 8.1% in 2022, versus a 6.7% return of the MSCI World Index.Story continuesDividend investing usually brings well-known companies into focus. Investors are inclined toward quality companies that have proven track records of dividend growth and strong balance sheets. The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO), PepsiCo, Inc. (NASDAQ:PEP), and The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG) are some companies that are most popular among income investors. However, several other, lesser known companies also have strong dividend policies that would be great investment options in the current market situation.

That is because the Mar 17, 2023 $1.00 Call had some of the highest implied volatility of all equity options today.What is Implied Volatility?Implied volatility shows how much movement the market is expecting in the future. Options with high levels of implied volatility suggest that investors in the underlying stocks are expecting a big move in one direction or the other. It could also mean there is an event coming up soon that may cause a big rally or a huge sell-off. However, implied volatility is only one piece of the puzzle when putting together an options trading strategy.What do the Analysts Think?Clearly, options traders are pricing in a big move for Macerich shares, but what is the fundamental picture for the company? Currently, Macerich is a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) in the REIT and Equity Trust - Retail industry that ranks in the Top 43% of our Zacks Industry Rank. Over the last 60 days, no analysts have increased their earnings estimates for the current quarter, while five have dropped their estimates. The net effect has taken our Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current quarter from 43 cents per share to 41 cents in that period.Given the way analysts feel about Macerich right now, this huge implied volatility could mean there’s a trade developing. Oftentimes, options traders look for options with high levels of implied volatility to sell premium. This is a strategy many seasoned traders use because it captures decay. At expiration, the hope for these traders is that the underlying stock does not move as much as originally expected.Looking to Trade Options?Check out the simple yet high-powered approach that Zacks Executive VP Kevin Matras has used to close recent double and triple-digit winners.

Its conveniently located grocery-anchored properties, a focus on mixed-use assets and a strong balance sheet position augur well.Kimco’s properties are located in the drivable first-ring suburbs of its major metropolitan Sunbelt and coastal markets, which offer several growth levers like high employment and strong spending power. Particularly, 86% of the annual base rent comes from its top major metro markets.During uncertain times, the grocery component saved the grace of the retail REITs and currently, 81% of Kimco’s annual base rent comes from grocery-anchored centers. The company targets to achieve 85% of its ABR from this segment by 2025.Kimco signed 1,696 leases, aggregating 10.7 million square feet in 2022, of which 1,171 were renewals and options and 525 were new leases. Pro-rata portfolio occupancy at the end of the fourth quarter was 95.7%, reflecting an expansion of 130 basis points (bps) year over year and 40 bps sequentially.Pro-rata anchor occupancy was 98.0%, up 90 bps year over year and 20 bps from the previous quarter. Pro-rata small-shop occupancy ended the quarter at 90.0%, representing an uptick of 230 bps from the prior-year quarter and 80 bps from the prior quarter.Given the necessity-driven nature of the grocery-anchored portfolio, this upbeat trend is likely to continue in the upcoming period, ensuring a steady stream of cash flow.Further, Kimco has been focusing on its mixed-use assets clustered in strong economic metropolitan statistical areas that serve the last mile. This segment is gaining from the recovery in the apartment and retail sectors. Through a selected collection of mixed-use projects, redevelopments and active investment management, KIM has been targeting to increase its net asset value.Also, Kimco maintains a robust balance sheet position and has ample financial flexibility. This retail REIT exited the fourth quarter of 2022 with more than $2.1 billion of immediate liquidity.However, inflationary pressure and economic slowdown might cast a pall on the recovery. Also, higher e-commerce adoption might continue to affect retail landlords’ cash flows.With the pandemic's impact waning, mall traffic has rebounded significantly. However, given the convenience of online shopping, it is likely to continue being a popular choice among consumers. Consequently, this might impact the market share for brick-and-mortar stores and hurt the demand for KIM’s properties.  Higher interest rates might increase Kimco's borrowing costs, affecting its ability to purchase or develop real estate. Further, the dividend payout might become less attractive than the yields on fixed-income and money market accounts.Shares of this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company have lost 14.4% in the past three months, wider than the industry’s decline of 6.7%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Kimco’s first-quarter 2023 funds from operations per share has remained unchanged at 39 cents over the past two months.Story continuesZacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchStocks to ConsiderSome better-ranked stocks from the retail REIT sector are Federal Realty Investment Trust FRT and Essential Properties Realty Trust EPRT, each carrying a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) at present.

And the group that holds the biggest piece of the pie are institutions with 77% ownership. That is, the group stands to benefit the most if the stock rises (or lose the most if there is a downturn).Given the vast amount of money and research capacities at their disposal, institutional ownership tends to carry a lot of weight, especially with individual investors. Therefore, a good portion of institutional money invested in the company is usually a huge vote of confidence on its future.Let's take a closer look to see what the different types of shareholders can tell us about Alliant Energy. View our latest analysis for Alliant Energy ownership-breakdownWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Alliant Energy?Institutions typically measure themselves against a benchmark when reporting to their own investors, so they often become more enthusiastic about a stock once it's included in a major index. We would expect most companies to have some institutions on the register, especially if they are growing.Alliant Energy already has institutions on the share registry. Indeed, they own a respectable stake in the company. This implies the analysts working for those institutions have looked at the stock and they like it. But just like anyone else, they could be wrong. If multiple institutions change their view on a stock at the same time, you could see the share price drop fast. It's therefore worth looking at Alliant Energy's earnings history below. Of course, the future is what really matters.earnings-and-revenue-growthInstitutional investors own over 50% of the company, so together than can probably strongly influence board decisions. Hedge funds don't have many shares in Alliant Energy. Our data shows that The Vanguard Group, Inc. is the largest shareholder with 13% of shares outstanding. With 9.0% and 5.6% of the shares outstanding respectively, BlackRock, Inc. and State Street Global Advisors, Inc. are the second and third largest shareholders.Story continuesA closer look at our ownership figures suggests that the top 20 shareholders have a combined ownership of 51% implying that no single shareholder has a majority.Researching institutional ownership is a good way to gauge and filter a stock's expected performance. The same can be achieved by studying analyst sentiments. Quite a few analysts cover the stock, so you could look into forecast growth quite easily.Insider Ownership Of Alliant EnergyWhile the precise definition of an insider can be subjective, almost everyone considers board members to be insiders. The company management answer to the board and the latter should represent the interests of shareholders. Notably, sometimes top-level managers are on the board themselves.I generally consider insider ownership to be a good thing. However, on some occasions it makes it more difficult for other shareholders to hold the board accountable for decisions.Our information suggests that Alliant Energy Corporation insiders own under 1% of the company. It is a very large company, so it would be surprising to see insiders own a large proportion of the company. Though their holding amounts to less than 1%, we can see that board members collectively own US$22m worth of shares (at current prices). In this sort of situation, it can be more interesting to  see if those insiders have been buying or selling. General Public OwnershipWith a 23% ownership, the general public, mostly comprising of individual investors, have some degree of sway over Alliant Energy. This size of ownership, while considerable, may not be enough to change company policy if the decision is not in sync with other large shareholders.Next Steps:It's always worth thinking about the different groups who own shares in a company. But to understand Alliant Energy better, we need to consider many other factors.

You can skip our detailed analysis of dividend stocks and their historical performance, and go directly to read 5 Under-the-Radar High Dividend Stocks to Buy. The global economy has take a massive hit last year due to elevated inflation, rising interest rates and geopolitical uncertainty. The world economy is slowing as IMF forecasted global growth to slow to 2.3% this year from 6% in 2021 and 3.2% last year. Analysts and economists have also hinted toward the possible financial crisis in 2023. In the US, 24% of economists surveyed by the World Economic Forum expect high inflation this year, whereas 91% expect weak economic growth. The sizzling inflation and the risks of a possible recession have altered investor sentiment.Considering the current market situation and investment scenarios, analysts recommend putting money in dividend stocks as they have the ability to open up regular income channels for investors. David Rosenberg of Rosenberg Research and Associates spoke to MarketWatch about possible investment strategies in the high-interest rates period in February. He mentioned that investors should focus on defensive sectors of the financial markets, including dividend-paying stocks. He further said that dividend companies with strong balance sheets and dividend payouts endure periods of financial volatility better than their peers.Many other reports conform to Rosenberg’s analysis, revealing the strong performance of dividend stocks in high-interest rates periods. According to iShares, the S&amp;P 500 Dividend Payers fell by 7.6% last year, compared with a 21.1% decline in the S&amp;P 500 Non-Dividend Payers. The report also mentioned that in the 1940s and the 1907s, when inflation was at its record high, dividends contributed 53% and 50% of the stock market’s total return. Another report by Nuveen throws light on the importance of high-dividend stocks and how healthy dividend yields generate better returns for shareholders. According to the report, dividend payers with yields above 3% delivered an annual average return of 8.1% in 2022, versus a 6.7% return of the MSCI World Index.Story continuesDividend investing usually brings well-known companies into focus.

(NASDAQ:REGN)?",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/declining-stock-solid-fundamentals-market-110028807.html,1678791628,STORY,['REGN'],"[It is hard to get excited after looking at Regeneron Pharmaceuticals' (NASDAQ:REGN) recent performance, when its stock has declined 3.6% over the past week. However, stock prices are usually driven by a company’s financial performance over the long term, which in this case looks quite promising. Specifically, we decided to study Regeneron Pharmaceuticals'  ROE in this article.Return on Equity or ROE is a test of how effectively a company is growing its value and managing investors’ money. Simply put, it is used to assess the profitability of a company in relation to its equity capital. See our latest analysis for Regeneron Pharmaceuticals How To Calculate Return On Equity?Return on equity can be calculated by using the formula:Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' EquitySo, based on the above formula, the ROE for Regeneron Pharmaceuticals is:19% = US$4.3b ÷ US$23b (Based on the trailing twelve months to December 2022).The 'return' refers to a company's earnings over the last year. One way to conceptualize this is that for each $1 of shareholders' capital it has, the company made $0.19 in profit.What Is The Relationship Between ROE And Earnings Growth?Thus far, we have learned that ROE measures how efficiently a company is generating its profits. Based on how much of its profits the company chooses to reinvest or ""retain"", we are then able to evaluate a company's future ability to generate profits. Assuming all else is equal, companies that have both a higher return on equity and higher profit retention are usually the ones that have a higher growth rate when compared to companies that don't have the same features.Regeneron Pharmaceuticals' Earnings Growth And 19% ROEAt first glance, Regeneron Pharmaceuticals seems to have a decent ROE. Even so, when compared with the average industry ROE of 25%, we aren't very excited. Still, we can see that Regeneron Pharmaceuticals has seen a remarkable net income growth of 32% over the past five years. We believe that there might be other aspects that are positively influencing the company's earnings growth. For example, it is possible that the company's management has made some good strategic decisions, or that the company has a low payout ratio. Bear in mind, the company does have a respectable ROE. It is just that the industry ROE is higher. So this also does lend some color to the high earnings growth seen by the company.Story continuesWe then performed a comparison between Regeneron Pharmaceuticals' net income growth with the industry, which revealed that the company's growth is similar to the average industry growth of 35% in the same period.past-earnings-growthEarnings growth is an important metric to consider when valuing a stock. What investors need to determine next is if the expected earnings growth, or the lack of it, is already built into the share price. By doing so, they will have an idea if the stock is headed into clear blue waters or if swampy waters await. What is REGN worth today? The  intrinsic value infographic in our free research report  helps visualize whether REGN is currently mispriced by the market.Is Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Making Efficient Use Of Its Profits?Given that Regeneron Pharmaceuticals doesn't pay any dividend to its shareholders, we infer that the company has been reinvesting all of its profits to grow its business.ConclusionOverall, we are quite pleased with Regeneron Pharmaceuticals' performance. Specifically, we like that it has been reinvesting a high portion of its profits at a moderate rate of return, resulting in earnings expansion. Having said that, the company's earnings growth is expected to slow down, as forecasted in the current analyst estimates.

If you want to read about some more clothing companies, go directly to the 5 Most Valuable Clothing Companies in the World.After experiencing 18 months of robust growth (early 2021 through mid-2022), the clothing industry faces a challenging climate once again. Hyperinflation and depressed customer sentiments had already resulted in declining growth rates in the second half of 2022, and a slowdown is likely to persist this year. The Russia-Ukraine war has disrupted the chances of global economic recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic, at least in the short term. This has led to economic sanctions on multiple countries, a steep rise in commodity prices, and supply chain disruptions, thus causing inflation across goods and services.According to a survey conducted by McKinsey, a global management consulting firm, clothing companies are anticipating a spike in their costs on account of inflation, with 97 % of surveyed executives forecasting that their cost of goods sold and selling, general and administrative (SG&amp;A) expenses will rise in 2023. Cotton and cashmere prices, for example, have increased 45% and 30% year-on-year, respectively. The fashion market, excluding the luxury sector, will struggle to deliver significant growth in 2023. McKinsey's analysis of fashion forecasts projects relatively slow sales growth of between –2% and +3%, weighed down by a contraction in the European market. China and the United States, on the other hand, are expected to fare better.The clothing industry, also known as the apparel market, includes clothing ranging from sportswear to business wear to daily wear to luxury products. The pandemic has acted as a massive restraint on the apparel manufacturing market in 2022 as supply chains were disrupted due to trade restrictions and consumption declined due to lockdowns imposed by governments globally. Despite this, the global clothing market has endured relatively better compared to other industries, growing from $610.12 billion in 2022 to $652.94 billion in 2023. In terms of future outlooks, the market is further expected to grow to $830.69 billion in 2027 at a CAGR of 6.2%. In global comparison, the United States led the charge with $343.70 billion in revenues. With intense competitive rivalry in the industry, leading companies have continued to provide product differentiation with a dynamic approach to meet the changing trends. Additionally, the increasing demand for online shopping is expected to help the apparel manufacturing market grow.Story continues15 Most Valuable Clothing Companies in the WorldPhoto by Keagan Henman on UnsplashOur MethodologyTo come up with the 15 most valuable clothing companies in the world, we used stock screeners to identify the biggest clothing companies by market capitalization.

A Cisco spokesperson said the ruling reinforces that the PTO's patent review proceedings are ""an important vehicle to preserve a balanced patent system, protect innovation, and assure patent quality in the United States.""Representatives for the other plaintiffs did not immediately respond to requests for comment.The PTO's Patent Trial and Appeal Board is popular with big tech companies that are often targeted with patent lawsuits and that use the board's ""inter partes review"" process to contest patents they are accused of infringing. An internal rule that gave the agency's judges greater discretion to deny inter partes review petitions ""dramatically reduced access"" to the process, the companies told the appeals court.Apple, Google, Cisco, Intel Corp and Edwards Lifesciences Corp sued the PTO in the California federal court in 2020 over the rule. They argued it undermined the role inter partes review plays in ""protecting a strong patent system"" and violated federal law.Companies including Tesla, Honda, Comcast and Dell filed briefs at the Federal Circuit in support of the plaintiffs.The California court dismissed the case in 2021, citing U.S. Supreme Court rulings that Patent Trial and Appeal Board decisions on whether to review inter partes review petitions cannot be appealed.The Federal Circuit also rejected the companies' arguments that the rule was arbitrary and violated U.S. patent law. But the three-judge panel said the PTO may have been required to hold a period of public notice and comment before making the rule, and that it could be challenged based on that argument.The case is Apple Inc v. Vidal, U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit, No. 22-1249. (Reporting by Blake Brittain in Washington)]"

Given its impressive performance, we decided to study the company's key financial indicators as a company's long-term fundamentals usually dictate market outcomes. Specifically, we decided to study Cisco Systems'  ROE in this article.ROE or return on equity is a useful tool to assess how effectively a company can generate returns on the investment it received from its shareholders. In simpler terms, it measures the profitability of a company in relation to shareholder's equity. View our latest analysis for Cisco Systems How To Calculate Return On Equity?ROE can be calculated by using the formula:Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' EquitySo, based on the above formula, the ROE for Cisco Systems is:27% = US$11b ÷ US$41b (Based on the trailing twelve months to January 2023).The 'return' is the yearly profit. So, this means that for every $1 of its shareholder's investments, the company generates a profit of $0.27.What Is The Relationship Between ROE And Earnings Growth?So far, we've learned that ROE is a measure of a company's profitability. We now need to evaluate how much profit the company reinvests or ""retains"" for future growth which then gives us an idea about the growth potential of the company. Generally speaking, other things being equal, firms with a high return on equity and profit retention, have a higher growth rate than firms that don’t share these attributes.Cisco Systems' Earnings Growth And 27% ROEFirstly, we acknowledge that Cisco Systems has a significantly high ROE.
