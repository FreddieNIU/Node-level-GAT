This 1 Stock Could Be the Perfect Pick,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/value-investor-1-stock-could-144002847.html,1668177602,STORY,['UNM'],"[For new and old investors, taking full advantage of the stock market and investing with confidence are common goals.Many investors also have a go-to methodology that helps guide their buy and sell decisions. One way to find winning stocks based on your preferred way of investing is to use the Zacks Style Scores, which are indicators that rate stocks based on three widely-followed investing types: value, growth, and momentum.Why Investors Should Pay Attention to This Value StockDifferent than growth or momentum investors, value-focused investors are all about finding good stocks at good prices, and discovering which companies are trading under what their true value is before the broader market catches on. The Value Style Score utilizes ratios like P/E, PEG, Price/Sales, and Price/Cash Flow to help pick out the most attractive and discounted stocks.Unum (UNM)Headquartered in Chattanooga, TN, Unum Group (UNM) was created following the Jun 1999 merger of Provident Companies, Inc. and Unum Corporation. Along with disability insurance, the company provides long-term care insurance, life insurance, employer- and employee-paid group benefits and related services. Since Jan 2003, UnumProvident has been classifying its operations into five segments: Income Protection, Life and Accident, Colonial, Corporate, and Other. Effective Jul 1, 2005, the company modified its reporting segments to separate its United States business from its United Kingdom subsidiary, Unum Limited. The company's business operations are now segmented as follows:UNM is a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) stock, with a Value Style Score of A and VGM Score of B. Shares are currently trading at a forward P/E of 6.9X for the current fiscal year compared to the Insurance - Accident and Health industry's P/E of 15.6X. Additionally, UNM has a PEG Ratio of 0.6 and a Price/Cash Flow ratio of 8X. Value investors should also note UNM's Price/Sales ratio of 0.7X.A company's earnings performance is important for value investors as well. For fiscal 2022, four analysts revised their earnings estimate higher in the last 60 days for UNM, while the Zacks Consensus Estimate has increased $0.16 to $6.19 per share. UNM also holds an average earnings surprise of 34.9%.UNM should be on investors' short lists because of its impressive earnings and valuation fundamentals, a good Zacks Rank, and strong Value and VGM Style Scores.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

2,d7a0d705-da2b-3c0b-b1ac-dfc50eb44c22,UNM,2022-11-12,Give Your Investments a Boost With These 4 Low P/CF Stocks,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/investments-boost-4-low-p-124812854.html,1668170892,STORY,"['UNM', 'AER', 'HCCI']","[The U.S. economy made a sharp comeback in the third quarter, with GDP rising 2.6%, according to the ""advance"" estimate released by the Bureau of Economic Analysis. The positive reading on the economic front has lessened the longstanding fears of a recession, at least for the time being. Wall Street also looks a bit confident now after a dismal show in the first three quarters of 2022.But does sustained economic growth look plausible from here onward? Inflationary pressure, a rising interest rate environment and ongoing geopolitical tensions are enough to derail the momentum. We note that the consumer spending rate decelerated in the last quarter. So, while you modify your portfolio to cope with the changing market scenario and continued monetary policy tightening, market pundits are placing their bets on value stocks.Investment in stocks made on diligent value analysis is usually considered one of the best practices. In value investing, investors pick stocks that are cheap but fundamentally sound. There are a number of ratios to identify value stocks but none alone can conclusively determine their inherent potential.Each ratio helps an investor understand a particular aspect of the company’s business. One such ratio, Price to Cash Flow (or P/CF), can work wonders in stock picking if used prudently. This metric evaluates the market price of a stock relative to the amount of cash flow that the company is generating on a per-share basis – the lower the number, the better. Unum Group UNM, AerCap Holdings N.V. AER, Heritage-Crystal Clean, Inc. HCCI and Sterling Infrastructure, Inc. STRL  boast a low P/CF ratio.Why P/CF Ratio?You must be wondering why we are considering this when the most widely used valuation metric is Price/Earnings (or P/E). Well, one of the important factors that make P/CF a highly dependable metric is that operating cash flow adds back non-cash charges such as depreciation and amortization to net income, truly diagnosing a company’s financial health.Analysts caution that a company’s earnings are subject to accounting estimates and management manipulation. Then again, cash flow is quite reliable. Net cash flow unveils how much money a company generates and how effectively management is deploying the same.A positive cash flow indicates an increase in the company’s liquid assets. This gives the company the means to settle debt, meet its expenses, reinvest in the business, endure downturns and finally undertake shareholder-friendly moves. Negative cash flow implies a decline in the company’s liquidity, which, in turn, lowers its flexibility to support these endeavors.However, an investment decision solely based on the P/CF metric may not fetch the desired results. To identify stocks that are trading at a discount, you should expand your search criteria and take into account the price-to-book ratio, price-to-earnings ratio and price-to-sales ratio. Adding a favorable Zacks Rank and a Value Score of A or B to your search criteria should lead to even better results as these eliminate the chances of falling into a value trap.Story continuesThe Bargain Hunting StrategyHere are the parameters for selecting true value stocks:P/CF less than or equal to X-Industry Median.Price greater than or equal to 5: The stocks must all be trading at a minimum of $5 or higher.Average 20-Day Volume greater than 100,000: A substantial trading volume ensures that the stock is easily tradable.P/E using (F1) less than or equal to X-Industry Median: This parameter shortlists stocks that are trading at a discount or are equal to its peers.P/B less than or equal to X-Industry Median: A lower P/B compared with the industry average implies that there is enough room for the stock to gain.P/S less than or equal to X-Industry Median: The P/S ratio determines how a stock price compares to the company’s sales — the lower the ratio the more attractive the stock is.PEG less than 1: The ratio is used to determine a stock's value by taking the company's earnings growth into account. The PEG ratio gives a more complete picture than the P/E ratio. A value of less than 1 indicates that the stock is undervalued and that investors need to pay less for a stock that has robust earnings growth prospects.Zacks Rank less than or equal to 2: Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) stocks are known to outperform irrespective of the market environment.Value Score of less than or equal to B: Our research shows that stocks with a Style Score of A or B when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 or 2 offer the best upside potential.Here are four of the 14 stocks that qualified the screening:Unum Group, which provides financial protection benefit solutions, carries a Zacks Rank #2 and has an expected EPS growth rate of 12.2% for three-five years. The company has a trailing four-quarter earnings surprise of 34.9%, on average.

3,fef2faef-58c7-32a5-9d9b-faa1c15eeeea,QRVO,2022-11-12,"Time To Worry? Analysts Are Downgrading Their Qorvo, Inc. (NASDAQ:QRVO) Outlook",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/time-worry-analysts-downgrading-qorvo-121933664.html,1668255573,STORY,['QRVO'],"[Market forces rained on the parade of Qorvo, Inc. (NASDAQ:QRVO) shareholders today, when the analysts downgraded their forecasts for this year. Revenue and earnings per share (EPS) forecasts were both revised downwards, with the analysts seeing grey clouds on the horizon. Surprisingly the share price has been buoyant, rising 11% to US$96.78 in the past 7 days. With such a sharp increase, it seems brokers may have seen something that is not yet being priced in by the wider market.Following the downgrade, the consensus from 24 analysts covering Qorvo is for revenues of US$3.7b in 2023, implying a chunky 18% decline in sales compared to the last 12 months. Statutory earnings per share are anticipated to plunge 62% to US$2.60 in the same period. Previously, the analysts had been modelling revenues of US$4.1b and earnings per share (EPS) of US$4.51 in 2023. Indeed, we can see that the analysts are a lot more bearish about Qorvo's prospects, administering a measurable cut to revenue estimates and slashing their EPS estimates to boot. Check out our latest analysis for Qorvo earnings-and-revenue-growthThe consensus price target fell 11% to US$96.08, with the weaker earnings outlook clearly leading analyst valuation estimates. There's another way to think about price targets though, and that's to look at the range of price targets put forward by analysts, because a wide range of estimates could suggest a diverse view on possible outcomes for the business. There are some variant perceptions on Qorvo, with the most bullish analyst valuing it at US$128 and the most bearish at US$80.00 per share. This shows there is still some diversity in estimates, but analysts don't appear to be totally split on the stock as though it might be a success or failure situation.These estimates are interesting, but it can be useful to paint some more broad strokes when seeing how forecasts compare, both to the Qorvo's past performance and to peers in the same industry. We would highlight that sales are expected to reverse, with a forecast 33% annualised revenue decline to the end of 2023. That is a notable change from historical growth of 11% over the last five years. By contrast, our data suggests that other companies (with analyst coverage) in the same industry are forecast to see their revenue grow 7.1% annually for the foreseeable future. It's pretty clear that Qorvo's revenues are expected to perform substantially worse than the wider industry.Story continuesThe Bottom LineThe biggest issue in the new estimates is that analysts have reduced their earnings per share estimates, suggesting business headwinds lay ahead for Qorvo. Unfortunately analysts also downgraded their revenue estimates, and industry data suggests that Qorvo's revenues are expected to grow slower than the wider market. Given the scope of the downgrades, it would not be a surprise to see the market become more wary of the business.With that said, the long-term trajectory of the company's earnings is a lot more important than next year.

In spite of the relatively cheap prices, insiders made the decision to sell US$1.4m worth of stock in the last 12 months. This could be a warning indicator of vulnerabilities in the future.While insider transactions are not the most important thing when it comes to long-term investing, we would consider it foolish to ignore insider transactions altogether. View our latest analysis for U.S. Bancorp U.S. Bancorp Insider Transactions Over The Last YearNotably, that recent sale by Timothy Welsh is the biggest insider sale of U.S. Bancorp shares that we've seen in the last year. That means that even when the share price was below the current price of US$44.92, an insider wanted to cash in some shares. As a general rule we consider it to be discouraging when insiders are selling below the current price, because it suggests they were happy with a lower valuation. Please do note, however, that sellers may have a variety of reasons for selling, so we don't know for sure what they think of the stock price. This single sale was just 26% of Timothy Welsh's stake.Insiders in U.S. Bancorp didn't buy any shares in the last year. You can see a visual depiction of insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last 12 months, below. By clicking on the graph below, you can see the precise details of each insider transaction!insider-trading-volumeFor those who like to find winning investments this free list of growing companies with recent insider purchasing, could be just the ticket.Insiders At U.S. Bancorp Have Sold Stock RecentlyOver the last three months, we've seen significant insider selling at U.S. Bancorp. In total, insiders dumped US$1.4m worth of shares in that time, and we didn't record any purchases whatsoever. In light of this it's hard to argue that all the insiders think that the shares are a bargain.Insider OwnershipMany investors like to check how much of a company is owned by insiders. I reckon it's a good sign if insiders own a significant number of shares in the company. U.S. Bancorp insiders own about US$91m worth of shares. That equates to 0.1% of the company. This level of insider ownership is good but just short of being particularly stand-out. It certainly does suggest a reasonable degree of alignment.Story continuesWhat Might The Insider Transactions At U.S. Bancorp Tell Us?Insiders haven't bought U.S. Bancorp stock in the last three months, but there was some selling. Looking to the last twelve months, our data doesn't show any insider buying. While insiders do own shares, they don't own a heap, and they have been selling. We'd practice some caution before buying! While we like knowing what's going on with the insider's ownership and transactions, we make sure to also consider what risks are facing a stock before making any investment decision. Case in point: We've spotted 1 warning sign for U.S. Bancorp you should be aware of.Of course, you might find a fantastic investment by looking elsewhere. So take a peek at this free list of interesting companies.For the purposes of this article, insiders are those individuals who report their transactions to the relevant regulatory body.

The rankings are based on factors including recruitment, retention, advancement and family support. U.S. Bank has appeared on the list each year since it began in 2010, ranking as No. 8 last year.The Military Times survey aims to capture the areas of greatest importance to transitioning service members, veterans and their families when looking for an employer. Recruitment and employment practices, as well as retention and support programs, are given the most weight and importance in scoring and final rankings.The survey ""spotlights companies' employment programs that help transitioning service members excel in their post-military careers,"" said Mort Greenberg, senior vice president of media solutions at Military Times.U.S. Bank supports military and veteran employees through expansive leave policies, free iPads for families to stay connected during deployments and the company's award-winning Proud to Serve BRG, among other efforts.For more than a decade, the more than 5,000-member Proud to Serve BRG has played a leading role in shaping how the company supports military and veteran employees, customers and community members. U.S. Bank also offers specialized products and services for veteran and military customers, as well as community initiatives such as partnering with military service organizations to donate off-lease vehicles to veterans and mortgage-free homes to wounded veterans.U.S. Bank is proud to serve those who served in our armed forces.

Young""I was on top of the world when I learned that I got an apartment here,"" said Young, who needed a new place to live due to the rent increase where he previously lived. Prior to that, he was homeless, and the thought of becoming homeless again was a great concern. ""I was eager to move here, so close to the VA hospital, and in a safe and clean environment,"" he adds.Story continuesThat proximity allows veterans like Young to walk or bike to their appointments and treatments, as well as to the food pantries near the area.""I can now say that I will never go hungry again,"" said Young, who's also a cancer survivor.The project is the result of a collective effort and commitment from multiple governmental, nonprofit, and private institutions, including the Milwaukee Preservation Alliance, Greater Milwaukee Foundation, Center for Veterans Issues, the Milwaukee War Memorial, and the Wisconsin Veterans Museum. The Housing Authority of the City of Milwaukee is also a partner and the facility operator. The housing and services are supported by the HUD-VASH program.""It is so amazing to see the impact this historic preservation project has had in the quality of life of the veterans who live here,"" said Amy Mauel, who manages the Homeless Prevention Programs at the Milwaukee VA Medical Center. ""I am happy and grateful that these partnerships came together to make this happen.""The six buildings at Milwaukee Soldiers Home were originally built as part of a legislation that President Abraham Lincoln signed in March 1865, one month before his assassination. Its purpose was to create homes for Civil War veterans who needed medical care. ""Old Main"", the Victorian Gothic building, was built in 1867 to provide medical and social services for soldiers onsite and is again providing supportive housing for those veterans most at risk.""To work on this project was the opportunity of a lifetime, one that required teamwork and creativity,"" said Jonathan Beck, development project manager at The Alexander Company. ""This is now an integrated community, where you see veterans from multiple generations and conflicts living together in a space that gives them supportive housing, just like it was originally intended for.""In March 2021, Old Main and five other historic buildings on the 90+ acre campus located about four miles west of downtown Milwaukee reopened as a supportive housing complex for veterans.""As an African American man and a veteran, I'm thankful to live in a place that was built to support soldiers that were fighting to ensure our freedom,"" said Young. ""After so many years this continues to be a special place, where all of us as soldiers have a bond regardless of where we come from or the branch we served.""The Milwaukee Soldiers Home has been recognized numerous times, such as in 2021 when it was the recipient of the Richard H.

The company's third sustainability report will recap the company's fiscal year 2022, which ended on May 31, 2022.Cintas ESG Logo and Media Use Assets (Dropbox): Available Here""Cintas' sustainable business strategy dates back to our company's origins and we have always worked closely with the communities in which we live and serve, so the theme ‘A Shared Drive for Better' is a natural fit as we develop our ESG brand,"" said Christy Nageleisen, Cintas Vice President of ESG and Chief Compliance Officer. ""As our ESG Journey progresses, we will continue to innovate and refine our processes to help sustain the world we live in, build on our culture of respect, belonging, and inclusion, and hold ourselves accountable with world-class business practices. This approach is inherent to our almost century-old shared drive for better.""""We believe our new ESG brand will help us bring attention to the heightening focus on sustainability and it will be important as environmental, social, and governance issues gain greater awareness and attention from different groups,"" said Todd Schneider, Cintas President and CEO. ""We're proud of the work we've done to advance our ESG ambitions over the years. This work has created better outcomes for us all, and we know our continued attention to effecting more sustainable solutions is critical for our continued success. Our culture is one of ""positive discontent, and we always strive for better in every aspect of our organization.""Cintas' ESG VisionThe new ESG brand is themed ""A Shared Drive for Better"" to bring into focus the collective impact Cintas believes it can make for a better future.Story continuesThe company's strategy builds on its collaboration with its customers, employee-partners, shareholders, suppliers, and communities the company serves. Cintas aims to bring everyone together to identify opportunities and to implement changes that support safer, cleaner and more sustainable workplaces.Cintas' ESG Vision articulates its ambitions in this area: ""Guided by our principles, we work together to provide businesses with the sustainable products, services, and solutions they need for a better workday, supporting our partners and the communities we serve, building a better future.""Logo &amp; Visual IdentifyThe new Cintas ESG logo features three distinct colors to represent the three different components of ESG: environment, social and governance.The brand's visual identity features a ""water leaf"" in the logo. This helps impart the importance of the environment and water stewardship in our ESG Journey.ESG at CintasCintas' sustainable business model has underpinned the company's growth strategy and imparted a holistic ""Reduce, Reuse, Recycle"" mentality throughout the company's operations.This approach dates back to the company's origins almost 100 years ago during the Great Depression. Out-of-work circus performers Doc and Amelia Farmer went around to Cincinnati-area businesses and collected their dirty, discarded shop rags from their trash bins, and brought the dirty rags home to launder them. When the rags were clean, Doc and Amelia then sold them back to area businesses, thereby extending their useful lives and reducing companies' ongoing need to replace their discarded rags with brand-new rags.Since then, the company has grown and expanded business operations to include uniform and apparel rental programs, facility services, first aid and safety products and services, and fire protection services.Cintas' cultural focus on its Principal Objective, its Corporate Character and Management Systems - defined by Founder Dick Farmer in his book, ""Spirit is the Difference"" - has resulted in ESG-centric business practices embedded holistically into Cintas' operations from its start.To learn more about Cintas' ESG program, including its most recent reporting, visiting cintas.com/esg.About Cintas CorporationCintas Corporation helps more than one million businesses of all types and sizes get Ready™ to open their doors with confidence every day by providing products and services that help keep their customers' facilities and employees clean, safe, and looking their best.

The Walmart sell-off was reinforced by an even more disappointing release from Target TGT the following day.Unlike the market’s indiscriminate negative reaction to Walmart and Target’s quarterly reports in May, it reacted favorably to Walmart’s July-quarter release on August 16th even though Target shares sold off on its quarterly report the following day.This recent history is useful to keep in mind as we look ahead to the October-quarter reports from Walmart and Target on Tuesday (11/15) and Wednesday (11/16), respectively.The chart below shows the year-to-date performance of Walmart (blue line) and Target (red line) shares relative to the S&amp;P 500 index (green line).Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchPart of the explanation for Walmart’s stock market stability is the nature of its business which offers a high degree of defense during periods of economic instability and uncertainty. Walmart also benefits from its perceived value proposition to customers that likely prompts segments of consumers to ‘trade down’ to its stores.The big issue in the last two quarterly releases for Walmart and Target centered on rising inventory levels, which reflected the combined effects of shifting consumer behavior and moderating sales. The market seems to believe, based on its treatment of the two stocks, that Walmart is further along in addressing its inventory issue than Target.We have no reason to disprove the market’s optimism about Walmart on the inventory issue, but we can nevertheless see the stock as vulnerable to any signs of weakness in this week’s quarterly report. On the flip side, Target shares appear ‘spring loaded’ for a bounce if the company’s release Wednesday morning turns out to be ‘less bad’ than the market fears.With respect to the Retail sector 2022 Q3 earnings season scorecard, we now have results from 21 of the 34 retailers in the S&amp;P 500 index. The Retail sector companies that have reported already are digital vendors like Amazon or restaurant operators like McDonald’s.Story continuesUnlike the official S&amp;P sector classifications that leaves retail sector players spread around different sectors, primarily Consumer Discretionary, Zacks’ stand-alone Retail sector classification that houses conventional retailers, digital players and restaurants allows for a more granular understanding of trends in the space.Total Q3 earnings for these retailers are down -5.8% from the same period last year on +10.4% higher revenues, with 71.4% beating EPS estimates and 52.4% beating revenue estimates.The comparison charts below put the Q3 beats percentages for these retailers in a historical context.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchAs you can see above, retailers have been struggling to come out with positive surprises thus far, with the trend particularly notable on the revenues side.With respect to the earnings and revenue growth rates, Amazon’s weak numbers play a significant role in the year-over-year growth rate for the sector (Amazon is part of the Zacks Retail sector, and not the Zacks Technology sector).The two comparison charts below show the Q3 earnings and revenue growth relative to other recent periods, both with Amazon’s results (left side chart) and without Amazon’s numbers (right side chart).Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchThis Week’s Reporting DocketWe have more than 350 companies on deck to report results this week, including 15 S&amp;P 500 members. Notable companies reporting this week, aside from a host of traditional retailers, include Nvidia NVDA, Cisco Systems CSCO, Applied Materials AMAT and others.Q3 Earnings Season Scorecard Including all of the results that came out through Friday, November 11th, we now have Q3 results from 461 S&amp;P 500 members that combined account for 92.2% of the index’s total membership.For the 461 index members that have reported results already, total earnings are up +2.6% from the same period last year on +12.4% higher revenues, with 69.4% beating EPS estimates and 67.9% beating revenue estimates.Here is how the 2022 Q3 earnings and revenue growth rates for these companies compare across different periods.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchHere is how the 2022 Q3 EPS and revenue beats percentages for these companies compare across different periods.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchThe EPS and revenue beats percentages are below what we had seen from this same group of companies in recent quarters, but otherwise within the historical range by now.Tracking Earnings Estimate RevisionsThe chart below that shows the blended earnings and revenue growth for 2022 Q3 relative to what we saw in the preceding four quarters and what is expected in the coming three periods.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchThis is no surprise, as the global economy is going through a synchronized slowdown, under the combined effects of rising interest rates in response to inflationary pressures, still-lingering logistical challenges that have started to ease up and China’s continuing zero-Covid restrictions.The orange bars in the chart above represent revenue growth. So, for 2022 Q3, revenues are on track to grow +11.4% from the same period last year even though earnings are only expected to be up +1.5%. This seemingly elevated revenue growth is a direct function of pricing power, with companies able to pass on rising input costs to end consumers. We intuitively know that this can’t go on forever and current projections for the next three quarters bears out this intuition.The above chart shows that earnings in the current period (2022 Q4) are expected to be -4.2% below the year-earlier level on +4.9% higher revenues. Estimates have been steadily coming down, in line with the trend that we saw ahead of the start of the Q3 earnings season.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchEstimates for full-year 2023 have been coming down as well, with the negative revisions trend particularly notable on an ex-Energy basis. You can see this in the chart below that shows the aggregate 2023 earnings estimate on an ex-Energy basis.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchSince mid-April, 2023 earnings estimates in the aggregate have come down by -8.1% for the S&amp;P 500 index as a whole and -10.9% on an ex-Energy basis. The cuts to estimates have been particularly notable for the Tech (down -18.2% since mid-April), Construction (-22.3%), Retail (-18.4%), Industrial Products (-11.9%), Consumer Discretionary (-18.1%) and Aerospace (-12.0%).The chart below shows the overall earnings picture on an annual basis.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchThere are some in the market who think that 2023 earnings should be below the 2022 level instead of the current expected +3.5% growth simply because the U.S. economy is expected to go through a moderate recession.I am not suggesting that 2023 earnings can’t be below the 2022 level; they can be and on current revisions trend are likely headed there. But it is wrong to expect moderate declines in ‘real’ GDP to automatically result in ‘nominal’ or non-inflation adjusted corporate earnings to also decline. Corporate revenues and earnings are ‘nominal’ values and will reflect the effects of inflation. Inflation is expected to come down in 2023, but nevertheless remain positive.For a detailed look at the overall earnings picture, including expectations for the coming periods, please check out our weekly Earnings Trends report &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Making Sense of the Earnings Picture and Estimate Revisions   Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Investors can't control the latter, but they can focus on a company's earnings results every quarter.The earnings figure itself is key, but a beat or miss on the bottom line can sometimes be just as, if not more, important. Therefore, investors should consider paying close attention to these earnings surprises, as a big beat can help a stock climb even higher.2 Stocks to Add to Your WatchlistThe Zacks Earnings ESP is more formally known as the Expected Surprise Prediction, and it aims to grab the inside track on the latest analyst estimate revisions ahead of a company's report. The idea is relatively intuitive as a newer projection might be based on more complete information. The ESP is calculated by comparing the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate, with the percentage difference between the two giving us the Zacks ESP figure.The last thing we will do today, now that we have a grasp on the ESP and how powerful of a tool it can be, is to look at a qualifying stock. Nordstrom (JWN) holds a Zacks Rank #3 at the moment and its Most Accurate Estimate comes in at $0.14 a share 11 days away from its upcoming earnings release on November 22, 2022.By taking the percentage difference between the $0.14 Most Accurate Estimate and the $0.13 Zacks Consensus Estimate, Nordstrom has an Earnings ESP of 1.02%.JWN is one of just a large database of Retail-Wholesale stocks with positive ESPs. Another solid-looking stock is GameStop (GME).GameStop, which is readying to report earnings on December 14, 2022, sits at a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) right now. It's Most Accurate Estimate is currently -$0.23 a share, and GME is 33 days out from its next earnings report.For GameStop, the percentage difference between its Most Accurate Estimate and its Zacks Consensus Estimate of -$0.29 is 20.69%.JWN and GME's positive ESP metrics may signal that a positive earnings surprise for both stocks is on the horizon.Story continuesFind Stocks to Buy or Sell Before They're ReportedUse the Zacks Earnings ESP Filter to turn up stocks with the highest probability of positively, or negatively, surprising to buy or sell before they're reported for profitable earnings season trading.

25,c11afade-624e-38b5-b58e-b0c98ee69a5d,O,2022-11-12,"Analysts Have Just Cut Their Laredo Petroleum, Inc. (NYSE:LPI) Revenue Estimates By 12%",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/analysts-just-cut-laredo-petroleum-120847491.html,1668254927,STORY,['CL=F'],"[The latest analyst coverage could presage a bad day for Laredo Petroleum, Inc. (NYSE:LPI), with the analysts making across-the-board cuts to their statutory estimates that might leave shareholders a little shell-shocked. There was a fairly draconian cut to their revenue estimates, perhaps an implicit admission that previous forecasts were much too optimistic.Following the latest downgrade, the current consensus, from the four analysts covering Laredo Petroleum, is for revenues of US$1.3b in 2023, which would reflect a concerning 34% reduction in Laredo Petroleum's sales over the past 12 months. Statutory earnings per share are anticipated to dive 22% to US$34.42 in the same period. Prior to this update, the analysts had been forecasting revenues of US$1.5b and earnings per share (EPS) of US$34.56 in 2023. So there's been a clear change in analyst sentiment in the recent update, with the analysts making a substantial drop in revenues and reconfirming their earnings per share estimates. See our latest analysis for Laredo Petroleum earnings-and-revenue-growthThe consensus has reconfirmed its price target of US$87.25, showing that the analysts don't expect weaker sales expectationsnext year to have a material impact on Laredo Petroleum's market value. There's another way to think about price targets though, and that's to look at the range of price targets put forward by analysts, because a wide range of estimates could suggest a diverse view on possible outcomes for the business. The most optimistic Laredo Petroleum analyst has a price target of US$127 per share, while the most pessimistic values it at US$71.00. Note the wide gap in analyst price targets? This implies to us that there is a fairly broad range of possible scenarios for the underlying business.Another way we can view these estimates is in the context of the bigger picture, such as how the forecasts stack up against past performance, and whether forecasts are more or less bullish relative to other companies in the industry. We would highlight that sales are expected to reverse, with a forecast 28% annualised revenue decline to the end of 2023. That is a notable change from historical growth of 14% over the last five years. Yet aggregate analyst estimates for other companies in the industry suggest that industry revenues are forecast to decline 6.8% per year. The forecasts do look bearish for Laredo Petroleum, since they're expecting it to shrink faster than the industry.Story continuesThe Bottom LineThe most important thing to take away is that there's been no major change in sentiment, with analysts reconfirming that earnings per share are expected to continue performing in line with their prior expectations.

26,14767409-108e-3dd6-b1cd-207843dc9e33,O,2022-11-12,Earnings Not Telling The Story For Carimin Petroleum Berhad (KLSE:CARIMIN),Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/earnings-not-telling-story-carimin-005219006.html,1668214339,STORY,['CL=F'],"[With a price-to-earnings (or ""P/E"") ratio of 19.5x Carimin Petroleum Berhad (KLSE:CARIMIN) may be sending bearish signals at the moment, given that almost half of all companies in Malaysia have P/E ratios under 13x and even P/E's lower than 7x are not unusual. Although, it's not wise to just take the P/E at face value as there may be an explanation why it's lofty.As an illustration, earnings have deteriorated at Carimin Petroleum Berhad over the last year, which is not ideal at all. It might be that many expect the company to still outplay most other companies over the coming period, which has kept the P/E from collapsing. If not, then existing shareholders may be quite nervous about the viability of the share price. Check out our latest analysis for Carimin Petroleum Berhad peAlthough there are no analyst estimates available for Carimin Petroleum Berhad, take a look at this free data-rich visualisation to see how the company stacks up on earnings, revenue and cash flow.What Are Growth Metrics Telling Us About The High P/E?There's an inherent assumption that a company should outperform the market for P/E ratios like Carimin Petroleum Berhad's to be considered reasonable.Retrospectively, the last year delivered a frustrating 51% decrease to the company's bottom line. As a result, earnings from three years ago have also fallen 76% overall. Therefore, it's fair to say the earnings growth recently has been undesirable for the company.Weighing that medium-term earnings trajectory against the broader market's one-year forecast for expansion of 13% shows it's an unpleasant look.With this information, we find it concerning that Carimin Petroleum Berhad is trading at a P/E higher than the market. Apparently many investors in the company are way more bullish than recent times would indicate and aren't willing to let go of their stock at any price. Only the boldest would assume these prices are sustainable as a continuation of recent earnings trends is likely to weigh heavily on the share price eventually.Story continuesThe Bottom Line On Carimin Petroleum Berhad's P/EGenerally, our preference is to limit the use of the price-to-earnings ratio to establishing what the market thinks about the overall health of a company.We've established that Carimin Petroleum Berhad currently trades on a much higher than expected P/E since its recent earnings have been in decline over the medium-term. Right now we are increasingly uncomfortable with the high P/E as this earnings performance is highly unlikely to support such positive sentiment for long. Unless the recent medium-term conditions improve markedly, it's very challenging to accept these prices as being reasonable.Don't forget that there may be other risks. For instance, we've identified   3 warning signs for Carimin Petroleum Berhad  that you should be aware of.If these risks are making you reconsider your opinion on Carimin Petroleum Berhad, explore our interactive list of high quality stocks to get an idea of what else is out there.Have feedback on this article?

""Risk could be stabilizing here.""The Fed has no choice but to press on, but if inflation is no longer rising, that indicates the end of more extensive tightening may be near, Loh said.The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.1%, the S&amp;P 500 gained 0.92% and the Nasdaq Composite advanced 1.88%.MSCI's all-country world index rose 1.91%, lifting it to its highest levels since mid-September, as the market repriced expectations for the Fed's target rate to peak below 5%, or about 20 basis points lower than recent highs.Story continuesThe MSCI emerging markets index jumped 5.19%, in its biggest single-day surge since March.Market bets that the Fed will raise rates by 50 basis points at its next meeting in December increased, while the probability of a 75 basis points hike decreased.""While this year has been amazingly exciting and fascinating from a market perspective, maybe its crescendo was really yesterday,"" said Christian Chan, chief investment officer at AssetMark Financial Holdings Inc.The CPI report showed that when ""you peeled back the number, it kept on getting better,"" but labor markets and corporate margins will be pressured as the Fed fights to lower inflation, posing potential headwinds for risk assets, Chan said.In Europe, euro zone yields firmed and the EU's executive European Commission said it sees a bigger euro zone slowdown in 2023, though only slightly affecting jobs or public finances.Britain's economy shrank in the three months to September at the start of what is likely to be a lengthy recession.John O'Toole, global head of multi-asset investment solutions at asset manager Amundi, said the reaction in stock markets to the CPI showed investors were ""pretty desperate"" for good news and could be getting ahead of themselves.Rates could ""stay at an elevated level for an extended period of time, and that's something that financial markets just don't have in their outlook,"" O'Toole said.The weaker outlook for corporate earnings and jobs has yet to be fully priced into markets, he added.Investors poured into risky assets after the U.S. data, driving the dollar down 1.6% on the day. The greenback posted its biggest two-day decline since March 2009.The yield on benchmark U.S. 10-year paper slipped below 4% on Thursday. U.S. bond markets are closed on Friday for Veterans Day.Asian shares scaled a seven-week high, with MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan set for its biggest one-day percentage jump since March 2020.In China, health authorities on Friday eased the country's heavy COVID curbs, including shortening by two days the quarantine times for close contacts of cases and inbound travelers. The country's blue-chip CSI 300 index rose 2.8% and the Hang Seng Index surged 7.7%.Oil prices rose after the U.S. inflation data but were on track for weekly declines of more than 4% due to COVID-related worries in China.U.S. crude futures settled up $2.49 at $88.96 a barrel, while Brent rose $2.32 to settle at $95.99.U.S. gold futures settled up 0.9% at $1,769.40 an ounce.The turmoil in cryptocurrency markets this week sent bitcoin to two-year lows.

Although the purchase is not a big one, by either a percentage standpoint or absolute value, it can be seen as a good sign. View our latest analysis for Sealed Air The Last 12 Months Of Insider Transactions At Sealed AirOver the last year, we can see that the biggest insider purchase was by CEO, President &amp; Director Edward Doheny for US$256k worth of shares, at about US$56.95 per share.

It's very possible they regret the purchase, but it's more likely they are bullish about the company. To us, it's very important to consider the price insiders pay for shares.

While this is a strong but not outstanding level of insider ownership, it's enough to indicate some alignment between management and smaller shareholders.Story continuesSo What Do The Sealed Air Insider Transactions Indicate?The recent insider purchases are heartening.

Utilities are benefiting from rate hikes and efficient cost management. The utility stocks are also focused on strengthening the grid as well as transmission and distribution infrastructure. The huge infrastructure of the utilities faces the impact of the hurricane season each year. Infrastructure enhancement around the year increases the resilience of the entire system, reduces outages and allows operators to restore power quickly for customers affected by storms.American Electric Power Company AEP, with a large investment to expand renewable operations, its widespread transmission and distribution assets, and well-chalked-out capital investments to boost infrastructure, offers an excellent opportunity to stay invested in the utility space. Other utilities worth adding to your portfolio include PG&amp;E Corporation PCG, Consolidated Edison ED and NRG Energy, Inc.  Inc. NRG.About the IndustryThe Utility – Electric Power industry involves the process of generation, transmission, distribution, storage and sale of electricity to customers. A substantial portion of utilities’ earnings is generated from regulated operations. Unless there is any major weather variation or unprecedented incidents, such as the coronavirus pandemic, demand for the services provided by utilities remains more or less steady, regardless of economic cycles. A clear transition is evident in this industry, with more companies declaring zero-emission goals on their own. Research and development over the years have resulted in a substantial decline in the cost of setting up utility-scale renewable power projects aiding in the reduction of emissions. However, the ongoing increase in interest rates is a concern for capital-intensive utilities.3 Electric Power Industry Trends to Watch Out ForTransition Toward Cleaner Sources to Generate Power:  The operators in the U.S. electric power sector are gradually moving toward the cleaner sources of energy to produce electricity. Per EIA, the annual share of U.S. electricity generation from renewable energy sources will rise from 20% in 2021 to 22% in 2022 and 24% in 2023 as a result of the continuing addition of solar and wind-generating capacity. EIA expects total solar, wind generation and battery storage addition of 38 GW and 54 GW to be added in 2022 and 2023, respectively. The expansion of renewable energy continues to eat into the share of coal in electricity generation, and EIA expects coal contribution to electricity generation to fall from 23% in 2021 to 20% in 2022 and further to 19% in 2023. EIA also expects the share of natural gas in power generation to drop from 38% in 2022 to 36% in 2023. The government is helping to increase the usage of renewable energy through tax credits, and operators are cutting down emissions on their own, intending to achieve carbon neutrality by 2050.Demand For Electricity Can Decline : Per EIA, 2023 electricity generation in the United States can drop 2% from the 2022 levels due to a decline in demand. EIA believes that the expected drop in demand for electricity in 2023 will be due to a cooler temperature forecast that would lead to less requirement for cooling and slight economic contraction. Despite the expected drop in demand, the addition of new renewable energy assets in the total generation portfolio will continue.Ongoing Increase Rate is a Concern: Utilities to maintain, upgrade and expand operations to approach the capital markets for loans to fund their capital projects.  Utilities regularly distribute dividend from their profits and don’t necessarily have enough retained profits to fund capital projects. The utilities have been enjoying near-zero interest rates for the past few years, but with six hikes have now pushed the benchmark rate to a range of 3.75%-4%, and more rate hikes are likely in the future.The increasing interest rates are a concern for capital-intensive utilities in the United States as they will push up capital servicing costs substantially from the current levels. U.S. utilities are currently spending a substantial amount on developing an advanced electricity network. Utilities might try to pass on the burden of increasing borrowing costs to customers, but the necessary raise in rates might not get approved by the commission. In such a scenario, the utilities will need to digest the extra expenses, which can lower their profitability and make them less attractive to investors interested in the utility space.Story continuesZacks Industry Rank Indicates Positive ProspectsThe group’s Zacks Industry Rank, which is basically the average of the Zacks Rank of all the member stocks, indicates strong near-term prospects. The 59-stock Utility - Electric Power industry is housed within the broader Zacks Utilities sector and currently carries a Zacks Industry Rank #71, which places it in the top 28% of more than 250 Zacks industries.

The positive response could be attributed to the company’s comfortable earnings beat and its continued shareholder return initiatives.What Did Marathon Oil’s Earnings Unveil?Marathon Oil reported third-quarter 2022 adjusted net income per share of $1.24, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.19 and soaring from the year-ago period’s profit of 39 cents.Marathon Oil’s bottom line was favorably impacted by stronger liquid realizations and solid domestic production.Marathon Oil reported revenues of $2.3 billion, which jumped from the year-ago sales of $1.5 billion and came 8.6% above the consensus mark.In good news for investors, the company is using the excess cash from a supportive environment to reward them with dividends and buybacks. As part of that, MRO has executed $3.4 billion of share repurchases since October 2021 and hiked dividend six times in the past seven quarters.Marathon Oil Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS SurpriseMarathon Oil Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS SurpriseMarathon Oil Corporation price-consensus-eps-surprise-chart | Marathon Oil Corporation Quote Segmental PerformanceThis Texas-based energy explorer’s total net production (from U.S. and International units) in the quarter under review came in at 352,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day (BOE/d) compared to 344,000 BOE/d in the year-ago period.U.S. E&amp;P: This U.S. upstream unit reported an income of $723 million, surging from $305 million in the year-ago period due to stronger production and commodity realizations.Marathon Oil’s average realized liquids prices (crude oil and condensate) of $93.67 per barrel were significantly above the year-earlier level of $69.40. Natural gas liquids average price realizations increased 10.8% to $34 a barrel. Moreover, average realized natural gas prices jumped 88% year over year to $7.84 per thousand cubic feet.Meanwhile, production costs were $6.40 per BOE, representing a 39.4% year-over-year rise.Net production of 295,000 BOE/d was up 3.9% from third-quarter 2021. Total U.S. output comprised approximately 56% oil, or 166,000 barrels per day (bpd).Higher year-over-year production from Bakken buoyed the company’s quarterly performance, which was partly offset by lower volumes from the Eagle Ford area. The Eagle Ford region recorded an average production of 90,000 BOE/d, down 5.3% from the level in third-quarter 2021 but output from Bakken was 118,000 BOE/d compared with 107,000 BOE/d in the year-ago quarter. Meanwhile, Oklahoma output came in at 54,000 BOE/d, essentially unchanged from the year-ago level of 55,000 BOE/d.International E&amp;P: The segment, which explores and produces oil and gas in Equatorial Guinea, reported earnings of $181 million compared with $93 million in the year-ago period due to higher liquids prices.Marathon reported production available for sale of 57,000 BOE/d, down from 61,000 Boe/d in third-quarter 2021.Marathon’s average realized liquids prices (crude oil and condensate) of $74.01 per barrel reflected a 31.3% improvement from the year-earlier quarter. Natural gas and natural gas liquids’ average price realizations came in at 24 cents per thousand cubic feet and $1 a barrel, respectively, the same as the corresponding period of 2021.Story continuesFinancial PositionTotal costs in the quarter were $1.1 billion, $37 million higher than the prior-year period. Marathon Oil reported an adjusted operating cash flow of $1.4 billion for the third quarter, up significantly from $775 million a year ago.As of Sep 30, it had cash and cash equivalents worth $1.1 billion and long-term debt of 3.6 billion. The debt-to-capitalization ratio of the company was 24.2.Marathon Oil spent $413 million in capital and exploratory expenditures during the quarter and raked in $1 billion in adjusted free cash flow.2022 GuidanceMarathon raised the capital budget guidance by $100 million to $1.4 billion for this year. Meanwhile, MRO continues to target shareholder returns over production growth. The Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company is targeting production in the range of 340,000 BOE/d to 350,000 BOE/d – essentially unchanged from last year. Further, Marathon expects oil volumes in the band of 168,000-176,000 barrels per day. Assuming $60 WTI, Marathon Oil expects to return a minimum of 40% of its cash flow from operations.You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Some Key E&amp;P EarningsWhile we have discussed MRO’s third-quarter results in detail, let’s see how some other oil and gas exploration and production companies have fared this earnings season.ConocoPhillips COP reported third-quarter adjusted earnings per share of $3.60, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $3.41. Further, COP’s bottom line significantly improved from the prior-year quarter’s $1.77 per share. One of the world’s largest independent oil and gas producers based in Houston, TX, ConocoPhillips’ strong quarterly results have been aided by increased oil-equivalent production volumes and realized commodity prices.ConocoPhillips also announced a quarterly ordinary dividend of 51 cents per share, indicating a 10.9% increase from the last paid 46 cents. Additionally, COP declared a variable return of cash payment of 70 cents per share, while the company’s board of directors approved a $20-billion increase in the existing share repurchase program to $45 billion.Another upstream giant, EOG Resources EOG, reported third-quarter adjusted earnings per share of $3.71, missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $3.75. EOG’s weaker-than-expected earnings were attributed to higher lease and well expenses, as well as transportation costs. However, the bottom line jumped from the year-ago quarter’s earnings of $2.16 due to increased volumes and prices.For the quarter under review, EOG Resources’ production increased around 9% year over year, while it generated $2.3 billion in free cash flow. Committed to shareholder returns, EOG announced a regular dividend of 82.5 cents per share, indicating a 10% increase from the last paid dividend.Finally, we have Pioneer Natural Resources Company PXD, which reported third-quarter earnings of $7.48 per share (excluding one-time items), beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $7.43. The bottom line surged from the year-ago quarter’s profit of $4.13 per share. PXD’s robust bottom line can be attributed to higher natural gas production volumes and commodity price realizations.Pioneer Natural announced a dividend payment of $5.71 per share of common stock, which includes a variable dividend of $4.61 per share and a base dividend of $1.10. This suggests a 33.4% decline from the last paid $8.57 per share.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research? Today, you can download 7 Best Stocks for the Next 30 Days.

The gradually increasing current ratio bodes well for Stericycle.Stericycle is progressing well with its comprehensive multiyear Business Transformation initiative aimed to improve its long-term operational and financial performance. Initiated in 2017, the five key objectives of the program include: improving the quality of revenues; driving operational efficiency through work measurement, asset optimization, technology and strategic sourcing; rationalizing portfolio through divestitures; lowering debt and bettering leverage, and implementing ERP.A Key RiskStericycle operates in a highly competitive industry. The barriers to entry in the regulated waste collection and disposal business are very high. In addition to stiff competition from large national companies, many small, regional and local companies compete aggressively in terms of pricing. This had earlier forced Stericycle to reduce prices to retain its existing customers and attract new ones.

60,c69d8d9b-4496-32e5-8173-de642585e483,ADM,2022-11-12,Wall Street Cheers Soft Inflation Data: 5 Growth Picks,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/wall-street-cheers-soft-inflation-125912708.html,1668171552,STORY,['ADM'],"[For the most part of this year, the U.S. stock market has been bleeding owing to stubbornly high inflation, compelling the Federal Reserve to tighten its monetary policy. Consumer spending slowed down because of a hawkish Fed, and consequently, economic growth was disrupted.However, signs of inflation cooling down in the month of October increased investors’ risk appetite, and stocks logged their best rally since 2020 on Nov 10. The Dow surged more than 1,200 points yesterday and closed at its highest level since August.Similarly, the broader S&amp;P 500 closed at its highest level since Sep 12, while the tech-laden Nasdaq registered its biggest one-day rise in percentage point terms since March 2020.The Bureau of Labor Statistics, in fact, noted that the consumer price index (CPI) increased 7.7% from a year ago in October. But the annual rise in inflation was down from September’s 8.2%. At the same time, the CPI increased less than expected in the prior month.What’s more, the core CPI, which excludes goods and service costs, rose 6.3% on an annual basis, slightly below September’s 6.6%, which was incidentally the highest year-over-year jump since August 1982.Nonetheless, thanks to such soft inflation data, the Fed is now widely expected to slow down its pace of rate hikes in the upcoming months, thereby propelling economic growth and boosting stock market returns.Lest we forget, the Fed has already approved its fourth-straight 0.75 percentage point rate hike in early November, taking the benchmark rate to between 3.75% and 4%, the highest in 14 years.Talking about stock market returns, the period from November to January usually bodes well for Wall Street. The S&amp;P 500, on average, advanced 4.5% in the said period since 1936, more than its overall three-month average gain of 2.9%, per quantitative analysts at the Bank of America, citing a MarketWatch article.Additionally, stocks tend to do well after midterm elections. As mentioned in the Schwab article, since 1946, in 17 out of 19 midterms, the stock market has given better returns in the six-month period following an election compared to the six months leading up to it. On Nov 8, Americans already voted, so it’s now expected that the stock market would steadily scale upward.Story continuesBanking on these positive developments, investors should place their bets on fundamentally sound growth stocks. We have highlighted five stocks that carry a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy), and a Growth Score of A or B, a combination that offers the best opportunities in the growth investing space.

However, stocks touching new 52-week highs are often predisposed to profit-taking, resulting in pullbacks and trend reversals.Moreover, given the high price, investors often wonder if the stock is overpriced. While the speculations are not absolutely baseless, all stocks hitting a 52-week high are not necessarily overpriced.In fact, investors might lose out on top gainers in an attempt to avoid the steep prices.Stocks such as Archer Daniels Midland ADM, OI Glass OI, Applied Industrial Technologies AIT, RPM International RPM and W&amp;T Offshore WTI are expected to maintain the momentum and keep scaling new highs. More information on a stock is necessary to understand whether or not there is scope for further upside.Here we discuss a strategy to find the right stocks.

This is because investors fear that the stocks are overvalued and expect the price to crash.Overvaluation is natural for most of these stocks as investors’ focus (or willingness to pay the premium) has helped them reach the level. But that does not always indicate an impending decline. Factors such as robust sales, surging profit levels, earnings growth prospects, and strategic acquisitions that encouraged investors to bet on these stocks could keep them motivated if there is no tangible negative. In other words, the momentum might continue.Also, when a string of positive developments dominates the market, investors find their under-reaction unwarranted, even if there are no company-specific driving forces.Setting the Right FiltersWe ran a screen to zero in on 52-week high stocks (trading near the high level) that hold tremendous upside potential. The screen includes parameters to shortlist stocks with strong earnings growth expectations, sturdy value metrics, and price momentum.Moreover, the screen filters stocks that are relatively undervalued compared to their peers in terms of earnings as well as sales, ensuring the continuation of their rally for some time.Story continuesCurrent Price/52 Week High &gt;= .80This is the ratio between the current price and the highest price at which the stock has traded in the past 52 weeks. A value greater than 0.8 implies that the stock is trading within 20% of its 52-week high range.% Change Price – 4 Weeks &gt; 0It ensures that the stock price has moved north over the past four weeks.% Change Price – 12 Weeks &gt; 0This metric guarantees a continued upward price momentum for the stock over the past three months as well.Price/Sales &lt;= XIndMedThe lower, the better.P/E using F(1) Estimate &lt;= XIndMedThis metric measures the amount an investor puts into a company to obtain one dollar of earnings. It narrows down the list of stocks to those that are undervalued compared to the industry.One-Year EPS Growth F(1)/F(0) &gt;= XIndMedThis helps choose stocks that have higher growth rates than the industry. This is a meaningful indicator, as decent earnings growth adds to investor optimism.Zacks Rank =1No screening is complete without the Zacks Rank, which has proved its worth since its inception. It is a fundamental truth that stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) have always managed to brave adversities and beat the market average. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Current Price &gt;= 5This parameter will help screen stocks that are trading at $5 or higher.Volume – 20 days (shares) &gt;= 100000The inclusion of this metric ensures that there is a substantial volume of shares, so trading is easier.Here are our five picks of the 42 stocks that made it through the screen:Archer Daniels Midland is one of the leading producers of food and beverage ingredients as well as goods made from various agricultural products.

(NYSE:PM) insiders,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/selling-us-17m-worth-stock-130214376.html,1668258134,STORY,['PM'],"[Even though Philip Morris International Inc. (NYSE:PM) stock gained 5.0% last week, insiders who sold US$17m worth of stock over the past year are probably better off. Holding on to stock would have meant their investment would be worth less now than it was at the time of sale. Thus selling at an average price of US$111, which is higher than the current price, may have been the best decision.While insider transactions are not the most important thing when it comes to long-term investing, logic dictates you should pay some attention to whether insiders are buying or selling shares. View our latest analysis for Philip Morris International Philip Morris International Insider Transactions Over The Last YearThe Executive Chairman of the Board, Andre Calantzopoulos, made the biggest insider sale in the last 12 months. That single transaction was for US$8.3m worth of shares at a price of US$111 each. We generally don't like to see insider selling, but the lower the sale price, the more it concerns us. The silver lining is that this sell-down took place above the latest price (US$94.47). So it may not tell us anything about how insiders feel about the current share price.Insiders in Philip Morris International didn't buy any shares in the last year. You can see a visual depiction of insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last 12 months, below. By clicking on the graph below, you can see the precise details of each insider transaction!insider-trading-volumeIf you like to buy stocks that insiders are buying, rather than selling, then you might just love this free list of companies. (Hint: insiders have been buying them).Insider Ownership Of Philip Morris InternationalLooking at the total insider shareholdings in a company can help to inform your view of whether they are well aligned with common shareholders. A high insider ownership often makes company leadership more mindful of shareholder interests. Philip Morris International insiders own about US$241m worth of shares (which is 0.2% of the company). This kind of significant ownership by insiders does generally increase the chance that the company is run in the interest of all shareholders.Story continuesWhat Might The Insider Transactions At Philip Morris International Tell Us?It doesn't really mean much that no insider has traded Philip Morris International shares in the last quarter. It's great to see high levels of insider ownership, but looking back over the last year, we don't gain confidence from the Philip Morris International insiders selling. So these insider transactions can help us build a thesis about the stock, but it's also worthwhile knowing the risks facing this company.

If you want to skip our discussion, you can check out the 5 Most Shorted Oil Stocks. Oil prices have been volatile because there has been so much going on around the globe. These historical occurrences, such as the more than two-year-old worldwide epidemic and the Ukraine-Russia conflict that broke out earlier this year, have caused oscillations in oil prices, which first fell into the negatives at the beginning of the pandemic before rising above $140 per barrel early this year. Since the beginning of the Ukraine-Russia crisis crude oil prices increased significantly due to supply-related concerns as tensions between Russia and Ukraine intensified.The activities of central banks worldwide, which have raised interest rates to combat rising inflation, have increased the likelihood that the demand for the commodity will decline. Additionally, the supply from the world's second-largest oil producer is uncertain due to ongoing sanctions against Russian oil shipments. Moreover, the oil-producing group known as OPEC+, which includes Saudi Arabia and Russia, announced in early October that it would lower its daily oil output quotas by 2 million barrels. Because the move may impact supply, strategists foresee a rise in oil prices.The US decision to stop drawing from its Strategic Petroleum Reserve in an effort to control prices, the forthcoming Russian oil embargo by the European Union in December, and the lack of drilling that has resulted in a shortage of US shale output were just a few of the numerous causes Goldman Sachs highlighted in a recent report. All of these elements have the potential to increase the cost of petroleum.Will oil prices stall or resume their surge in the remainder of 2022 and 2023, with so many variables tugging in different directions? Continue reading for a discussion of all the variables influencing changes in oil prices and the most recent Goldman Sachs oil price estimates.Story continuesOil to $125: 10 Most Shorted Oil Stocksbranislavpudar/Shutterstock.comA slowdown in China, the second-largest economy in the world, where COVID-zero limits have reappeared and are anticipated to have an impact on industrial output, is causing many investors to express alarm. As of November 9, Goldman Sachs predicted that oil prices might climb to $125 per barrel if lockdown measures in China are relaxed. The latest headlines, according to our China economists, ""merely signal the beginning of a multi-month phase of preparation for reopening,"" Goldman stated.On November 9, Brent, the benchmark for two-thirds of the world's oil, was marginally higher at $95.37 a barrel. However, the gauge used to monitor US oil, West Texas Intermediate, was down 0.15% at $88.78 per barrel.By opening a short position in the crude oil futures market, investors who are negative on crude oil might benefit from a decline in the price of the commodity. They can achieve this by shorting (selling) one or more contracts for crude oil futures on a futures market. If oil prices suddenly increase to $125 as predicted by Goldman Sachs, the 10 most shorted oil stocks will not only benefit for fundamental reasons (i.e. their profits will skyrocket) but also for technical reasons as short investors will rush to cover their short positions and these stocks will increase more than the other oil stocks. Some of the notable oil stocks that a large number of oil investors include in their portfolios are Schlumberger Limited (NYSE:SLB), Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM), and Shell plc (NYSE:SHEL). It is true that these are relatively safer bets in the energy industry. However, Schlumberger Limited (NYSE:SLB), Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM), and Shell plc (NYSE:SHEL) aren't heavily shorted stocks and failed to make our list. We believe the 10 stocks we covered in this article are more likely to deliver outsized gains if oil prices hit $125 in 2023.Our Methodology The equities were chosen based on the percentage of the float shorted as of November 10, 2022. Analyst ratings, business fundamentals, and growth forecasts have all been covered for each stock.

76,31609877-2f88-3991-95f7-a00821ce64f0,APTV,2022-11-12,10 Growth Stocks in Billionaire George Soros’ Portfolio,Insider Monkey,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/10-growth-stocks-billionaire-george-223832235.html,1668206312,STORY,"['INTU', 'APTV', 'QCOM']","[We prepared the following article about the growth stocks in George Soros' 13F portfolio 4 months ago. We don't have to wait 4 months to figure out what would happen if we imitated George Soros' growth stock picks. The original article will be presented in quotations whereas our new comments will be in regular paragraphs:George Soros is an American investor and the founder of Soros Fund Management. Whenever George Soros makes an investment decision, the market notices it. In Q1 2022, the value of the billionaire’s US stock holdings saw a decrease of about $2 billion. The decline was driven by a lowering of his stake in Rivian Automotive, Inc. (NASDAQ:RIVN) and the closing of some of the major holdings, such as IHS Markit Ltd.George Soros was right about trimming his market exposure, dumping his IHS position whose stock lost 40% of its value, and cutting his stake in Rivian Automotive (RIVN) which lost a quarter of its value.Keeping in view the current economic situation, George Soros discouraged investors from investing in China as the country’s real estate boom was dying down. As reported by CNN in February, Soros stated that the “unsustainable” model had enticed many to invest in property and real estate companies at a time when China was finding itself in the middle of an economic crisis. To support his perspective, the billionaire discussed the case of Evergrande, a real estate group in China that is struggling to repay its liabilities due to stringent national policies.George Soros was also right about Chinese stocks as Chinese heavyweights like Alibaba (BABA) lost a third of its value since the end of the first quarter.Despite the economic certainty, Soros Fund Management has not taken refuge in defensive stocks like most investment firms in Q1 2022. Instead, the hedge fund has initiated new positions or increased its holdings in growth stocks that have been outperforming the broader market. The fund’s chief executive and chief investment officer, Dawn Fitzpatrick, stated that even though inflation is rising at a faster rate than the increase in wages, US consumer still has enough money to settle their credit card debts. In an interview with Bloomberg, Fitzpatrick appeared unfazed by the inevitable recession and added that “rate increases will slow the economy and will impact inflation, but this economy has some shock absorbers built-in.”Story continuesFitzpatrick was proven right over the last 6 months. We haven't seen any increase in unemployment rate and the US consumers are still very strong. Yet, the inflation rate finally started to come down. On the other hand, growth stocks haven't been doing well since the end of the first quarter.Out of the ten stocks covered in this article, Soros Fund Management has increased its stake in eight stocks either by initiating a new position or adding to its previous holdings. Unlike Warren Buffett, who believes in value investing in entities with strong fundamentals and financials with a long-term investment horizon, Soros is a contrarian and speculative investor who relies on short-term movements in the market. Some of the notable names included in Soros’ Q1 2022 portfolio are Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG), Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), and Salesforce, Inc. (NYSE:CRM).best high yield dividend stocks according to george sorosWe have used the first quarter portfolio of Soros Fund Management to select these stocks. Companies with strong business fundamentals and growth prospects have been analyzed. Furthermore, we have also mentioned the number of hedge fund holders for each stock to give investors an idea about the popularity of these companies amongst institutional investors. Over 900 elite funds were tracked by Insider Monkey at the end of Q1 2022 to determine the hedge fund sentiment.The five stocks that we covered below, Proterra Inc (PTRA), Qualcomm Incorporated (QCOM), Aptiv PLC (APTV), Intuit Inc (INTU), indie Semiconductor Inc. (INDI) lost an average of 6.5% since the end of the first quarter, but outperformed the S&amp;P 500 ETF (SPY)'s 11% loss during the same period. Let's take a look:10 Growth Stocks in Billionaire George Soros’ Portfolio10. Proterra Inc. (NASDAQ:PTRA)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 16Soros Fund Management’s Holdings: $21,922,000Percentage of Soros Fund Management’s Portfolio: 0.33%Stock Price as of June 30: $4.76Return since March 31: -8.5%Proterra Inc. (NASDAQ:PTRA) is a Burlingame, California-based commercial electric vehicles (EVs) designer and manufacturer that went public at the peak of the special purpose acquisition vehicle (SPAC) boom during Q2 2021. Proterra Inc. (NASDAQ:PTRA) has sold 1,300 buses to more than 135 transit agencies across 43 US and Canadian states since its inception. The company provides not only commercial EVs but also offers complete charging solutions.Proterra Inc. (NASDAQ:PTRA) stock has lost 70% of its value since its IPO and has been engulfed with ongoing supply chain issues. Soros Management’s current holding is still equivalent to 2% of the company, making it the third biggest hedge fund holder of the stock. Michael Shlisky at DA Davidson also has a positive outlook on Proterra Inc. (NASDAQ:PTRA) as he initiated coverage on the stock with a Buy rating and a price target of $10 in a note issued on June 1. The analyst considers Proterra Inc. (NASDAQ:PTRA) stock as one of the pre-vetted, quality EV-truck companies. Shlisky added that the organization is also coming up as a first-choice battery provider to manufacturers of electric trucks.As of Q1 2022, Proterra Inc. (NASDAQ:PTRA) was held by 16 hedge funds.9. QUALCOMM Incorporated (NASDAQ:QCOM)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 73Soros Fund Management’s Holdings: $23,571,000Percentage of Soros Fund Management’s Portfolio: 0.35%Stock Price as of June 30: $131.60Return since March 31: -19.7%QUALCOMM Incorporated (NASDAQ:QCOM) is a San Diego, California-based wireless technology company that produces critical components for 5G-enabled smartphones, electric vehicles, cameras, and smart homes.On June 28, the equity research team at Bank of America added QUALCOMM Incorporated (NASDAQ:QCOM) to the “US 1 List.” The list comprises the best publicly listed investment ideas across every sector of the economy. The company has a bright outlook as it has been reported that the Cupertino, California-based tech giant Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) has failed to come up with its own 5G chips for iPhones. Hence, it would have to rely upon QUALCOMM Incorporated (NASDAQ:QCOM) as its exclusive partner.QUALCOMM Incorporated (NASDAQ:QCOM) would be responsible for providing 100% of the chips for iPhones produced till the second half of the next year. This will surely provide an impetus to the top line and bottom line of the company. By the time Apple is prepared to replace Qualcomm’s chips in its devices, QUALCOMM Incorporated’s (NASDAQ:QCOM) other businesses would have matured and would counteract the adverse effect of losing the partnership.QUALCOMM Incorporated (NASDAQ:QCOM) was discussed in the Q4 2021 investor of ClearBridge Investments. Here’s what the firm said:“Market strength continued in the fourth quarter, with only the communication services sector down in the Russell 1000 Value Index. Portfolio returns benefited from the strong performance of semiconductor maker Qualcomm, which has executed exceptionally well in pursuing the transition to 5G, growing both content and share due to its leadership position in cellular technology. The chipmaker recently outlined a number of peripheral growth opportunities outside of mobile markets, including automotive (where it hopes to leverage its strong presence in the automotive infotainment space into advanced driver assistance systems), Internet of Things (including opportunities in the PC market, VR/AR market, and factory automation) and radio frequency (where mmWave adoption globally, including China, would drive substantial upside).”QUALCOMM Incorporated (NASDAQ:QCOM) was held by 73 funds at the end of Q1 2022.8. Aptiv PLC (NYSE:APTV)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 48Soros Fund Management’s Holdings: $29,313,000Percentage of Soros Fund Management’s Portfolio: 0.44%Stock Price as of June 30: $95.61Return since March 31: -6.7%Aptiv PLC (NYSE:APTV) is an Irish-American automotive technology corporation involved in advanced safety and user experience, signal and power solutions, and autonomous mobility.In a note issued to investors on June 1, Mark Delaney at Goldman Sachs gave Aptiv PLC (NYSE:APTV) stock a target price of $135 with a Buy rating. The analyst gave the rating and target price, keeping in view the existing supply chain challenges in the short-term along with an anticipation of lower demand in the medium term. Delaney anticipates automobile production of 79 million in 2022 and 84 million in 2023 globally. The analyst lowered the US seasonal adjusted annual rate (SAAR) forecast to 14.5 million for 2022 due to rising interest rates and high inflation. Aptiv PLC (NYSE:APTV) is expected to be a beneficiary of faster EV adoption.Aptiv PLC (NYSE:APTV) was mentioned in the Q1 2022 investor letter of ClearBridge Investments. Here’s what the firm said:“The acceleration in electrification of transport should support electric vehicle (EV)-related stocks like Aptiv (NYSE:APTV), which came under pressure in the quarter on concerns the auto cycle is past its peak. Aptiv provides a range of solutions for the auto industry, including autonomous driving technologies, safety technologies, components, and wiring. The large exposure of APTV to EVs should lead to long-term value as EVs continue their growth, boosted by their relative attractiveness as prices at the pump hit near-historic highs.”Aptiv PLC (NYSE:APTV) was held by 48 elite funds at the end of Q1 2022.7. Intuit Inc. (NASDAQ:INTU)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 82Soros Fund Management’s Holdings: $29,729,000Percentage of Soros Fund Management’s Portfolio: 0.45%Stock Price as of June 30: $386.29Return since March 31: -14.7%Intuit Inc. (NASDAQ:INTU) is a Palo Alto, California-based software corporation that specializes in developing financial software.On May 25, Brad Reback at Stifel gave Intuit Inc. (NASDAQ:INTU) stock a Buy rating with a price target of $465. The analyst highlighted that the company delivered strong Q3 FY22 results despite a weak tax season. The impact of the weak tax season was countered by the strong performance of the company’s two brands, Credit Karma and Mailchimp. During the earnings calls, the management reiterated several times that the business is not getting impacted by economic uncertainty. However, Intuit Inc. (NASDAQ:INTU) is still exposed to a slowdown in the overall economy despite the size and diversity of its offerings ranging from Mint, QuickBooks, and TurboTax. Following the quarterly results, Intuit Inc. (NASDAQ:INTU) also raised its FY22 EPS guidance.Baron Funds discussed its stance on Intuit Inc. (NASDAQ:INTU) in its Q1 2022 investor letter. Here’s what the firm said:“At the company-specific level, with 59% of our holdings posting double-digit declines during the quarter, we had no chance to hold up against the Index that was down less than 5%. The good news is that for the most part, this draw-down did not result in a permanent loss of capital and in many cases, we believe fundamentals have remained robust or improved even though stock prices declined. One example is Intuit (NASDAQ:INTU), the leading provider of accounting software, and our second largest detractor in the quarter. The stock lost 25% of its value (or over $45 billion) due to a miss in quarterly revenues, which was driven by a slower start to the tax season, leading the company to miss consensus estimates for consumer revenues by about $190 million. The slower start to the tax season is of course insignificant to the intrinsic value of the business, as everyone knows there are only two certainties in life and one of them is – TAXES! And so, naturally, Intuit reaffirmed its annual projections. Moreover, results in other segments were ahead of expectations. CEO Sasan Goodarzi explained the outperformance during its quarterly conference call by saying:‘We have a nearly $300 billion addressable market driven by tailwinds that include a shift to virtual solutions, an acceleration to online and omni-channel capabilities, and digital money offerings. This, combined with the team’s excellence and execution is contributing to the strength of our performance.’More specifically, Intuit is gaining market share in tax filings (“we are on track to gain share overall again this season”), continues expanding its QuickBooks online offering, which was up 35% year-over-year, and is seeing strong synergies from its Credit Karma acquisition, driven by Intuit’s Lightbox technology, which allows better personalization of offerings to customers (for example, it “doubles the average approval rate for members who apply for credit cards on Credit Karma versus outside of Credit Karma”). The bottom line is that our estimates of Intuit’s intrinsic value were up while the stock price was down and therefore our future expected return has increased.”Overall, 82 funds held a stake in Intuit Inc. (NASDAQ:INTU) at the end of Q1 2022.6. indie Semiconductor, Inc. (NASDAQ:INDI)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 17Soros Fund Management’s Holdings: $34,018,000Percentage of Soros Fund Management’s Portfolio: 0.51%Stock Price as of June 30: $6.18Return since March 31: 17.3%indie Semiconductor, Inc. (NASDAQ:INDI) is an Aliso Viejo, California-based provider of semiconductor components to the automotive industry. The company was founded in 2007. At that time, the average cost of semiconductor components in a car stood at $200. However, over the years, this has increased to thousands of dollars due to technological advancement.The portfolio of products offered by indie Semiconductor, Inc. (NASDAQ:INDI) has an addressable market of $16 billion, which is expected to increase to $38 billion by 2025. The company reported a backlog of $2.6 billion during Q4 2021, while its market capitalization stands at around the $800 million level. In Q1 2022, indie Semiconductor, Inc. (NASDAQ:INDI) reported an EPS GAAP Actual of $0.07, surpassing the analysts’ estimates by $0.35. Furthermore, the company also beat the revenue estimates for the quarter by $428.8K.Here’s what Baron Funds said about indie Semiconductor, Inc. (NASDAQ:INDI) in its Q3 2021 investor letter:“Indie Semiconductor, Inc. is a fabless designer, developer, and marketer of automotive semiconductors for automated driver assistance systems, user experience, and electrification applications. Indie leverages its cross-domain semiconductor expertise in analog, processing and power chips to integrate multiple chips and capabilities into a single package and offer its customers lower cost products in a smaller form-factor. Indie has strong market share in applications such as Apple CarPlay and ultrasonic parking assist with multiple contracts ramping in the coming quarters in applications such as advanced lighting controls, telematics, and electrification. The stock rose on increasing investor recognition of the longer-term opportunity for the company, especially in light of the current automotive semiconductor supply shortage. Semiconductor content in cars is expected to grow substantially over the coming decade as automated safety features and electrification penetrate an increasing percentage of vehicles.”Out of the 912 hedge funds in Insider Monkey’s database, 17 funds held a stake in indie Semiconductor, Inc. (NASDAQ:INDI) as of Q1 2022.Besides indie Semiconductor, Inc. (NASDAQ:INDI), Soros also has a stake in popular companies such as Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG), Amazon.com, Inc.

ROST is scheduled to release third-quarter fiscal 2022 results on Nov 17. The off-price retailer of apparel and home accessories is likely to have witnessed revenue and earnings declines in the to-be-reported quarter.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for fiscal third-quarter revenues is pegged at $4.36 billion, indicating a decline of 4.7% from the figure reported in the year-ago quarter. For fiscal third-quarter earnings, the consensus mark of 80 cents per share suggests a decline of 26.6% from the year-ago quarter's reported number. The consensus mark for earnings has moved down by a penny in the past 30 days.In the last reported quarter, Ross Stores delivered an earnings surprise of 13.3%. It has delivered an earnings beat of 14.1%, on average, in the trailing four quarters.Ross Stores, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise Ross Stores, Inc. Price and EPS SurpriseRoss Stores, Inc. price-eps-surprise | Ross Stores, Inc. QuoteKey Factors to NoteRoss Stores has been witnessing robust customer demand, aiding the top line. Sales in the fiscal third quarter are likely to have benefited from broad-based growth across merchandise categories and regions, as well as robust comparable store sales. Sales are also expected to have gained from robust trends at the dd's DISCOUNTS business. Gains at the core business, driven by consumers' continued focus on value and the company’s ability to deliver value bargains to customers, bode well.On its last reported quarter’s earnings call, Ross Stores stated that the ongoing strength in consumer demand would likely continue despite the uncertainty regarding supply-chain woes.Ross Stores has been consistent with the execution of its store expansion plans, which are likely to have aided the top line. The company's store-expansion efforts have been focused on continually increasing penetration in existing and new markets. The third-quarter fiscal 2022 performance is anticipated to have gained from the company’s return to normal store opening targets. Gains from new stores are expected to get reflected in the company's sales for the fiscal third quarter.However, Ross Stores has been witnessing the effects of the ongoing industry-wide supply-chain challenges, leading to higher freight costs and distribution expenses. This is likely to have partly impacted the company’s cost of goods sold rate in the fiscal third quarter. Higher domestic freight expenses and distribution costs mainly on the ongoing supply-chain headwinds and higher wages are likely to have weighed on earnings in the to-be-reported quarter.On the last reported quarter's earnings call, Ross Stores anticipated continued impacts from the industry-wide supply-chain dynamics and other risks from inflation, as well as costs within its business, to hurt the fiscal third-quarter performance. Ross Stores provided a conservative view for the rest of fiscal 2022.Ross Stores anticipates comps to be down 7-9% for third-quarter fiscal 2022, whereas it reported 14% growth in third-quarter fiscal 2021. Earnings per share are envisioned to be 72-83 cents, whereas it reported $1.09 in third-quarter fiscal 2021.For third-quarter fiscal 2022, the company expects the operating margin to be 7.8-8.7%, down from 11.4% reported in the prior-year quarter. The operating margin is expected to be affected by the negative comp forecast, lower merchandise margin stemming from ocean freight costs and sluggish sales view, and increased markdowns. Also, the unfavorable timing of packaway-related costs is likely to hurt the operating margin.Story continuesZacks ModelOur proven model conclusively predicts an earnings beat for Ross Stores this time around.

Today's Research Daily features new research reports on 16 major stocks, including Amazon.com, Inc. (AMZN), Sanofi (SNY) and Target Corporation (TGT). These research reports have been hand-picked from the roughly 70 reports published by our analyst team today.You can see all of today’s research reports here &gt;&gt;&gt;Shares of Amazon.com have declined -45.2% over the past year against the Zacks Internet - Commerce industry’s decline of -48.6% and the -17.1% decline in the S&amp;P 500 index. Weighing on Amazon's near-term outlook is the view that the company's strong growth during Covid resulted from pulled forward revenues from future periods that need to be accounted for over the next few quarters. The company is also believed to have over-hired during the pandemic, as a result of which its cost base has signficantly increased. These near-term headwinds aside, it is gaining on solid Prime momentum owing to ultrafast delivery services and strong content portfolio. Strengthening relationship with third-party sellers is another positive. Also, growing momentum across Amazon Music is contributing well. Additionally, strong adoption rate of AWS is aiding the company’s cloud dominance. Expanding AWS services portfolio is continuously helping Amazon in gaining further momentum among the customers.Further, robust Alexa skills and expanding smart home products portfolio are positives. Additionally, the company’s strong global presence and solid momentum among the small and medium businesses remain tailwinds. Considering the abovementioned facts, the Zacks analyst expect 2022 revenue to be up 11% from 2021.(You can read the full research report on Amazon.com here &gt;&gt;&gt;)Sanofi’s shares have underperformed the Zacks Large Cap Pharmaceuticals industry over the past year (-12.7% vs. +10.7%). The company is facing headwinds include weak performance of diabetes drugs and generic competition for many drugs. However, Sanofi’s Specialty Care unit is on a strong footing, particularly with the regular label expansion of Dupixent.Dupixent has become the key top-line driver for Sanofi. With outside U.S. revenues accelerating and multiple approvals for new indications expected in the near future, its sales are expected to be higher. Sanofi possesses a leading vaccine portfolio, which has become the primary top-line driver. Its R&amp;D pipeline is strong.Several data read-outs are expected in 2022. Sanofi’s Consumer unit is delivering above market sales growth. Sanofi has also launched several new drugs in the past couple of years and is expanding its pipeline through M&amp;A deals.(You can read the full research report on Sanofi here &gt;&gt;&gt;)Target’s shares have declined -24.7% this year vs. Walmart's -1.5% drop and the S&amp;P 500 index's -18.2% drop. The market has been unwilling to give Target credit for the inventory growth issue that came through in its April-quarter report in May. This is a relatively favorable set up for the stock should next week's quarterly report turns out to be better than what the market fears. Story continuesTarget has been deploying resources to enhance omni-channel capabilities, come up with new brands, refurbish stores and expand same-day delivery options to provide customers seamless shopping experience.Target has been making multiple changes to its business model to adapt and stay relevant in the dynamic retail landscape. These have been contributing to the top line. We believe that Target’s attempt to right-size inventory is the step in the right direction, as the demand skewed toward consumer staples and away from discretionary categories.However, this hurt margins as was visible in the second quarter of fiscal 2022 but better position the company to gain market share. The Zacks analyst expect top line to increase 3% and 4.2% in the third- and fourth-quarter, respectively. For the back half of the year, we expect operating margin to improve sequentially.(You can read the full research report on Target here &gt;&gt;&gt;)Other noteworthy reports we are featuring today include Humana Inc.

Utilities are benefiting from rate hikes and efficient cost management. The utility stocks are also focused on strengthening the grid as well as transmission and distribution infrastructure. The huge infrastructure of the utilities faces the impact of the hurricane season each year. Infrastructure enhancement around the year increases the resilience of the entire system, reduces outages and allows operators to restore power quickly for customers affected by storms.American Electric Power Company AEP, with a large investment to expand renewable operations, its widespread transmission and distribution assets, and well-chalked-out capital investments to boost infrastructure, offers an excellent opportunity to stay invested in the utility space. Other utilities worth adding to your portfolio include PG&amp;E Corporation PCG, Consolidated Edison ED and NRG Energy, Inc.  Inc. NRG.About the IndustryThe Utility – Electric Power industry involves the process of generation, transmission, distribution, storage and sale of electricity to customers. A substantial portion of utilities’ earnings is generated from regulated operations. Unless there is any major weather variation or unprecedented incidents, such as the coronavirus pandemic, demand for the services provided by utilities remains more or less steady, regardless of economic cycles. A clear transition is evident in this industry, with more companies declaring zero-emission goals on their own. Research and development over the years have resulted in a substantial decline in the cost of setting up utility-scale renewable power projects aiding in the reduction of emissions. However, the ongoing increase in interest rates is a concern for capital-intensive utilities.3 Electric Power Industry Trends to Watch Out ForTransition Toward Cleaner Sources to Generate Power:  The operators in the U.S. electric power sector are gradually moving toward the cleaner sources of energy to produce electricity. Per EIA, the annual share of U.S. electricity generation from renewable energy sources will rise from 20% in 2021 to 22% in 2022 and 24% in 2023 as a result of the continuing addition of solar and wind-generating capacity. EIA expects total solar, wind generation and battery storage addition of 38 GW and 54 GW to be added in 2022 and 2023, respectively. The expansion of renewable energy continues to eat into the share of coal in electricity generation, and EIA expects coal contribution to electricity generation to fall from 23% in 2021 to 20% in 2022 and further to 19% in 2023. EIA also expects the share of natural gas in power generation to drop from 38% in 2022 to 36% in 2023. The government is helping to increase the usage of renewable energy through tax credits, and operators are cutting down emissions on their own, intending to achieve carbon neutrality by 2050.Demand For Electricity Can Decline : Per EIA, 2023 electricity generation in the United States can drop 2% from the 2022 levels due to a decline in demand. EIA believes that the expected drop in demand for electricity in 2023 will be due to a cooler temperature forecast that would lead to less requirement for cooling and slight economic contraction. Despite the expected drop in demand, the addition of new renewable energy assets in the total generation portfolio will continue.Ongoing Increase Rate is a Concern: Utilities to maintain, upgrade and expand operations to approach the capital markets for loans to fund their capital projects.  Utilities regularly distribute dividend from their profits and don’t necessarily have enough retained profits to fund capital projects. The utilities have been enjoying near-zero interest rates for the past few years, but with six hikes have now pushed the benchmark rate to a range of 3.75%-4%, and more rate hikes are likely in the future.The increasing interest rates are a concern for capital-intensive utilities in the United States as they will push up capital servicing costs substantially from the current levels. U.S. utilities are currently spending a substantial amount on developing an advanced electricity network. Utilities might try to pass on the burden of increasing borrowing costs to customers, but the necessary raise in rates might not get approved by the commission. In such a scenario, the utilities will need to digest the extra expenses, which can lower their profitability and make them less attractive to investors interested in the utility space.Story continuesZacks Industry Rank Indicates Positive ProspectsThe group’s Zacks Industry Rank, which is basically the average of the Zacks Rank of all the member stocks, indicates strong near-term prospects. The 59-stock Utility - Electric Power industry is housed within the broader Zacks Utilities sector and currently carries a Zacks Industry Rank #71, which places it in the top 28% of more than 250 Zacks industries.

The future results of NEP and its business and financial condition are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause NEP's actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied in the forward-looking statements. These risks and uncertainties could require NEP to limit or eliminate certain operations. These risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to, the following: NEP's ability to make cash distributions to its unitholders is affected by wind and solar conditions at its renewable energy projects; Operation and maintenance of renewable energy projects and pipelines involve significant risks that could result in unplanned power outages, reduced output or capacity, personal injury or loss of life; NEP's business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects can be materially adversely affected by weather conditions, including, but not limited to, the impact of severe weather; NEP depends on certain of the renewable energy projects and pipelines in its portfolio for a substantial portion of its anticipated cash flows; NEP may pursue the repowering of wind projects or the expansion of natural gas pipelines that would require up-front capital expenditures and could expose NEP to project development risks; Terrorist acts, cyberattacks or other similar events could impact NEP's projects, pipelines or surrounding areas and adversely affect its business; The ability of NEP to obtain insurance and the terms of any available insurance coverage could be materially adversely affected by international, national, state or local events and company-specific events, as well as the financial condition of insurers. NEP's insurance coverage does not provide protection against all significant losses; NEP relies on interconnection, transmission and other pipeline facilities of third parties to deliver energy from its renewable energy projects and to transport natural gas to and from its pipelines. If these facilities become unavailable, NEP's projects and pipelines may not be able to operate or deliver energy or may become partially or fully unavailable to transport natural gas; NEP's business is subject to liabilities and operating restrictions arising from environmental, health and safety laws and regulations, compliance with which may require significant capital expenditures, increase NEP's cost of operations and affect or limit its business plans; NEP's renewable energy projects or pipelines may be adversely affected by legislative changes or a failure to comply with applicable energy and pipeline regulations; Petroleos Mexicanos (Pemex) may claim certain immunities under the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act and Mexican law, and the Texas pipeline entities' ability to sue or recover from Pemex for breach of contract may be limited and may be exacerbated if there is a deterioration in the economic relationship between the U.S. and Mexico; NEP does not own all of the land on which the projects in its portfolio are located and its use and enjoyment of the property may be adversely affected to the extent that there are any lienholders or land rights holders that have rights that are superior to NEP's rights or the U.S. Bureau of Land Management suspends its federal rights-of-way grants; NEP is subject to risks associated with litigation or administrative proceedings that could materially impact its operations, including, but not limited to, proceedings related to projects it acquires in the future; NEP's operations require NEP to comply with anti-corruption laws and regulations of the U.S. government and Mexico; NEP is subject to risks associated with its ownership interests in projects that are under construction, which could result in its inability to complete construction projects on time or at all, and make projects too expensive to complete or cause the return on an investment to be less than expected; NEP relies on a limited number of customers and is exposed to the risk that they may be unwilling or unable to fulfill their contractual obligations to NEP or that they otherwise terminate their agreements with NEP; NEP may not be able to extend, renew or replace expiring or terminated power purchase agreements (PPA), natural gas transportation agreements or other customer contracts at favorable rates or on a long-term basis; If the energy production by or availability of NEP's renewable energy projects is less than expected, they may not be able to satisfy minimum production or availability obligations under their PPAs; NEP's growth strategy depends on locating and acquiring interests in additional projects consistent with its business strategy at favorable prices; Reductions in demand for natural gas in the United States or Mexico and low market prices of natural gas could materially adversely affect NEP's pipeline operations and cash flows; Government laws, regulations and policies providing incentives and subsidies for clean energy could be changed, reduced or eliminated at any time and such changes may negatively impact NEP's growth strategy; NEP's growth strategy depends on the acquisition of projects developed by NextEra Energy, Inc. (NEE) and third parties, which face risks related to project siting, financing, construction, permitting, the environment, governmental approvals and the negotiation of project development agreements; Acquisitions of existing clean energy projects involve numerous risks; NEP may continue to acquire other sources of clean energy and may expand to include other types of assets. Any further acquisition of non-renewable energy projects may present unforeseen challenges and result in a competitive disadvantage relative to NEP's more-established competitors; NEP faces substantial competition primarily from regulated utilities, developers, independent power producers, pension funds and private equity funds for opportunities in North America; The natural gas pipeline industry is highly competitive, and increased competitive pressure could adversely affect NEP's business; NEP may not be able to access sources of capital on commercially reasonable terms, which would have a material adverse effect on its ability to consummate future acquisitions and pursue other growth opportunities; Restrictions in NEP and its subsidiaries' financing agreements could adversely affect NEP's business, financial condition, results of operations and ability to make cash distributions to its unitholders; NEP's cash distributions to its unitholders may be reduced as a result of restrictions on NEP's subsidiaries' cash distributions to NEP under the terms of their indebtedness or other financing agreements; NEP's subsidiaries' substantial amount of indebtedness may adversely affect NEP's ability to operate its business, and its failure to comply with the terms of its subsidiaries' indebtedness could have a material adverse effect on NEP's financial condition; NEP is exposed to risks inherent in its use of interest rate swaps; Widespread public health crises and epidemics or pandemics may have material adverse impacts on NEP's business, financial condition, liquidity, results of operations and ability to make cash distributions to its unitholders; NEE has influence over NEP; Under the cash sweep and credit support agreement, NEP receives credit support from NEE and its affiliates. NEP's subsidiaries may default under contracts or become subject to cash sweeps if credit support is terminated, if NEE or its affiliates fail to honor their obligations under credit support arrangements, or if NEE or another credit support provider ceases to satisfy creditworthiness requirements, and NEP will be required in certain circumstances to reimburse NEE for draws that are made on credit support; NextEra Energy Resources, LLC (NEER) or one of its affiliates is permitted to borrow funds received by NEP's subsidiaries and is obligated to return these funds only as needed to cover project costs and distributions or as demanded by NextEra Energy Operating Partners, LP (NEP OpCo). NEP's financial condition and ability to make distributions to its unitholders, as well as its ability to grow distributions in the future, is highly dependent on NEER's performance of its obligations to return all or a portion of these funds; NEER's right of first refusal may adversely affect NEP's ability to consummate future sales or to obtain favorable sale terms; NextEra Energy Partners GP, Inc. (NEP GP) and its affiliates may have conflicts of interest with NEP and have limited duties to NEP and its unitholders; NEP GP and its affiliates and the directors and officers of NEP are not restricted in their ability to compete with NEP, whose business is subject to certain restrictions; NEP may only terminate the Management Services Agreement among, NEP, NextEra Energy Management Partners, LP (NEE Management), NEP OpCo and NextEra Energy Operating Partners GP, LLC (NEP OpCo GP) under certain limited circumstances; If the agreements with NEE Management or NEER are terminated, NEP may be unable to contract with a substitute service provider on similar terms; NEP's arrangements with NEE limit NEE's potential liability, and NEP has agreed to indemnify NEE against claims that it may face in connection with such arrangements, which may lead NEE to assume greater risks when making decisions relating to NEP than it otherwise would if acting solely for its own account; NEP's ability to make distributions to its unitholders depends on the ability of NEP OpCo to make cash distributions to its limited partners; If NEP incurs material tax liabilities, NEP's distributions to its unitholders may be reduced, without any corresponding reduction in the amount of the IDR fee; Holders of NEP's units may be subject to voting restrictions; NEP's partnership agreement replaces the fiduciary duties that NEP GP and NEP's directors and officers might have to holders of its common units with contractual standards governing their duties and the NYSE does not require a publicly traded limited partnership like NEP to comply with certain of its corporate governance requirements; NEP's partnership agreement restricts the remedies available to holders of NEP's common units for actions taken by NEP's directors or NEP GP that might otherwise constitute breaches of fiduciary duties; Certain of NEP's actions require the consent of NEP GP; Holders of NEP's common units currently cannot remove NEP GP without NEE's consent and provisions in NEP's partnership agreement may discourage or delay an acquisition of NEP that NEP unitholders may consider favorable; NEE's interest in NEP GP and the control of NEP GP may be transferred to a third party without unitholder consent; NEP may issue additional units without unitholder approval, which would dilute unitholder interests; Reimbursements and fees owed to NEP GP and its affiliates for services provided to NEP or on NEP's behalf will reduce cash distributions from NEP OpCo and from NEP to NEP's unitholders, and there are no limits on the amount that NEP OpCo may be required to pay; Increases in interest rates could adversely impact the price of NEP's common units, NEP's ability to issue equity or incur debt for acquisitions or other purposes and NEP's ability to make cash distributions to its unitholders; The liability of holders of NEP's units, which represent limited partnership interests in NEP, may not be limited if a court finds that unitholder action constitutes control of NEP's business; Unitholders may have liability to repay distributions that were wrongfully distributed to them; The issuance of securities convertible into, or settleable with, common units may affect the market price for NEP's common units, will dilute common unitholders' ownership in NEP and may decrease the amount of cash available for distribution for each common unit; NEP's future tax liability may be greater than expected if NEP does not generate net operating losses (NOLs) sufficient to offset taxable income or if tax authorities challenge certain of NEP's tax positions; NEP's ability to use NOLs to offset future income may be limited; NEP will not have complete control over NEP's tax decisions; and, Distributions to unitholders may be taxable as dividends. NEP discusses these and other risks and uncertainties in its annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2021 and other Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) filings, and this news release should be read in conjunction with such SEC filings made through the date of this news release.

93,7dd4080e-5d13-3c00-a7b8-f0d166a0e2b1,SPGI,2022-11-12,Insiders Are Buying the Dip on These 10 Stocks,Insider Monkey,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/insiders-buying-dip-10-stocks-204637636.html,1668199597,STORY,"['AMD', 'WDAY', 'SPGI', 'BKNG', 'EXPE', 'GOOGL', 'TSLA']","[At the end of July we identified 10 stocks that insiders were piling into and shared it with our subscribers. In this article we are going to revisit our July 2022 thesis in each stock and report each stock's performance. These stocks outperformed the market by an average of 1 percentage point since then. Here is how we saw the investment landscape 3.5 months ago:Record inflation and rising interest rates contributed to a 0.9% contraction in the United States (US) economy during the second quarter of 2022, per data recently released by the Department of Commerce. The advance estimate, made by the Bureau of Economic Analysis, is slightly below the 1.6% contraction in the economy registered in the first quarter of the year. However, the second straight quarter of decline indicates that the markets are already in a recession, per a technical definition of the word not followed by policymakers in the US. Prominent stocks like Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META), Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG), and Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) are all trading lower as the market digests the news. Sal Guatieri, a senior economist at BMO Capital Markets, recently told investors in a research note that “four-decade high inflation, rapidly rising borrowing costs, and a general tightening in financial conditions” were the prime factors behind the slowing economy. Per the economist, the US economy was now “highly vulnerable to slipping into a recession”. Mark Zandi, the chief economist at Moody’s Analytics, is of the view that the economy is slowing but not in a recession yet. In the US, the National Bureau of Economic Research declares if the economy is in a recession by relying on a determination by a group of researchers that weigh a broad range of factors. However, it may be months before the bureau makes a judgment on the April-June quarter of 2022. Insiders are using the panic at the markets, which has resulted in a broad correction in the value of equities, to identify buying opportunities. Our MethodologyThe companies that saw an increase in the number of hedge fund holders in the first quarter of 2022, compared to data for the fourth quarter of 2021, and witnessed a more than 20% drop in their share price year-to-date were selected for the list. Data from around 900 elite hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey in the first quarter of 2022 was used to identify the number of hedge funds that hold stakes in each firm. Story continuesInsiders Are Buying the Dip on These 10 StocksSource: pexelsInsiders Are Buying the Dip on These Stocks10. Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD)Number of Hedge Fund Holders in Q1 2022: 83  Number of Hedge Fund Holders in Q4 2021: 69 Decrease in Share Price Year-to-Date (through July 26th): 40.22% Return since July 26th: -14.9%Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) operates as a semiconductor firm. On July 27, the United States Senate passed the CHIPS Act, a bill that would give the chip industry in the country $52 billion in subsidies for domestic production and tax incentives of around $24 billion over the next ten years. The moves are part of a larger plan by the government to boost domestic chip firms to decrease reliance on Chinese companies. $200 billion for chip research are also included in the legislation. On July 20, Deutsche Bank analyst Ross Seymore maintained a Hold rating on Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) stock and lowered the price target to $85 from $115, noting that investors were waiting for a widespread deck-clearing guide-down in semi stocks.Among the hedge funds being tracked by Insider Monkey, Chicago-based investment firm Citadel Investment Group is a leading shareholder in Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) with 15.2 million shares worth more than $1.6 billion.Just like Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META), Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG), and Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA), Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) is one of the stocks that hedge funds are buying. In its Q4 2021 investor letter, Carillon Tower Advisers, an asset management firm, highlighted a few stocks and Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) was one of them. Here is what the fund said:“Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) supplies semiconductor chips for central processing units (CPUs) and graphic processing units (GPUs). The firm has been gaining share against its primary competitor in the datacenter server CPU space, as this rival has been unable to match the design and manufacturing capabilities of Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) and its partners. Investors are also looking forward to the closing of the previously announced merger with a semiconductor manufacturer that is another one of the portfolio’s holdings. The merger will increase AMD’s capabilities in the Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) chip space, and the combined company should possess the potential to win additional market share in the datacenter chip market.”9. Workday, Inc. (NASDAQ:WDAY)Number of Hedge Fund Holders in Q1 2022: 87 Number of Hedge Fund Holders in Q4 2021: 74 Decrease in Share Price Year-to-Date (through July 26th): 43.08% Return since July 26th: 10.8%Workday, Inc.

The nearby chart shows that industry competitor Hormel Foods HRL total return has climbed over the last year, while TSN shares have lagged the S&amp;P 500. Let’s see why Tyson might not be holding up and acting as defensive as one might assume.  Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchTyson Foods is the largest U.S. producer of chicken and is a leader in protein as a whole, with offerings across beef, pork, and prepared foods. Even though meat prices soared along with rising inflation, Tyson Foods has not been able to fully capitalize on rising commodities because of their own rising costs and other headwinds.TSN reached highs of $100.72 per share in February after posting record profits from its beef business last year. Profits have declined this year with the company struggling to meet demand in chicken production. Tyson Foods has faced labor shortages, along with higher labor costs.Last quarter, President and CEO Donnie King said improving chicken supply is one of the biggest issues facing the company, with Tyson Foods estimated to provide a fifth of the nation’s chicken production. The company struggled to fulfill orders due to limitations on supplies and labor. Investors will be hoping the operator of famous food brands such as Jimmy Dean and Hillshire Farm was able to improve on this during the quarter and help lift its outlook.OutlookThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for TSN’s fiscal Q4 earnings is $1.70 per share, which would be a decline of -26% from Q4 2021. Earnings estimates for the period have gone down from $1.77 at the beginning of the quarter. Sales for Q4 are expected to climb 4% at $13.29 billion. This is an indication that operating costs are weighing on TSN’s profits.Story continuesYear over year, TSN earnings are expected to rise 6% but decline -22% in FY23 at $6.88 per share. Sales are expected to be up 12% this year and be virtually flat in FY23 at $52.60 billion.Performance &amp; ValuationTSN is down -22% YTD to underperform the S&amp;P 500’s -18% and roughly match its peer group’s -20% decline. Over the last decade, TSN is up an impressive +372% when including its dividend to beat the benchmark and its peer group’s +135%. Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchTrading around $67 a share, TSN trades at 9.6X earnings. This is near the industry average P/E of 8.7X. TSN trades below its decade-high of 17.2X and the median of 12.2X. The stock trades attractively relative to its past but FY23 earnings are expected to decline significantly with estimate revisions also trending down over the last 90 days.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchBottom LineTSN lands a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) in correlation with declining earnings estimate revisions. Tyson Foods stock trades reasonably when considering its past, but a strong Q3 report and even stronger guidance will likely be crucial for the stock. TSN has consistently beat the Zacks Consensus but its most accurate Zacks estimate comes in well below the current consensus, indicating that it could fall short of expectations.The Tyson Foods report should also provide another perspective on the effect inflation had on consumer spending with big omnichannel retailers like Walmart WMT and Target TGT reporting next week as well.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

95,f9cdfe0c-e246-30fa-b9af-526787e43a6d,MA,2022-11-12,Mastercard Incorporated (NYSE:MA) institutional owners may be pleased with recent gains after 4.3% loss over the past year,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/mastercard-incorporated-nyse-ma-institutional-140309615.html,1668175389,STORY,['MA'],"[To get a sense of who is truly in control of Mastercard Incorporated (NYSE:MA), it is important to understand the ownership structure of the business. With 88% stake, institutions possess the maximum shares in the company. That is, the group stands to benefit the most if the stock rises (or lose the most if there is a downturn).Last week's US$27b market cap gain would probably be appreciated by institutional investors, especially after a year of 4.3% losses.Let's take a closer look to see what the different types of shareholders can tell us about Mastercard. View our latest analysis for Mastercard ownership-breakdownWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Mastercard?Many institutions measure their performance against an index that approximates the local market. So they usually pay more attention to companies that are included in major indices.We can see that Mastercard does have institutional investors; and they hold a good portion of the company's stock. This suggests some credibility amongst professional investors. But we can't rely on that fact alone since institutions make bad investments sometimes, just like everyone does. When multiple institutions own a stock, there's always a risk that they are in a 'crowded trade'. When such a trade goes wrong, multiple parties may compete to sell stock fast. This risk is higher in a company without a history of growth. You can see Mastercard's historic earnings and revenue below, but keep in mind there's always more to the story.earnings-and-revenue-growthInstitutional investors own over 50% of the company, so together than can probably strongly influence board decisions. We note that hedge funds don't have a meaningful investment in Mastercard. The MasterCard Foundation, Endowment Arm is currently the largest shareholder, with 11% of shares outstanding. The Vanguard Group, Inc. is the second largest shareholder owning 8.0% of common stock, and BlackRock, Inc. holds about 6.7% of the company stock.After doing some more digging, we found that the top 20 have the combined ownership of 50% in the company, suggesting that no single shareholder has significant control over the company.Story continuesWhile it makes sense to study institutional ownership data for a company, it also makes sense to study analyst sentiments to know which way the wind is blowing. Quite a few analysts cover the stock, so you could look into forecast growth quite easily.Insider Ownership Of MastercardThe definition of an insider can differ slightly between different countries, but members of the board of directors always count. Company management run the business, but the CEO will answer to the board, even if he or she is a member of it.Most consider insider ownership a positive because it can indicate the board is well aligned with other shareholders. However, on some occasions too much power is concentrated within this group.Our data suggests that insiders own under 1% of Mastercard Incorporated in their own names. As it is a large company, we'd only expect insiders to own a small percentage of it. But it's worth noting that they own US$332m worth of shares. In this sort of situation, it can be more interesting to  see if those insiders have been buying or selling. General Public OwnershipThe general public, who are usually individual investors, hold a 12% stake in Mastercard. While this group can't necessarily call the shots, it can certainly have a real influence on how the company is run.Next Steps:It's always worth thinking about the different groups who own shares in a company. But to understand Mastercard better, we need to consider many other factors.

96,9a52827d-abac-393c-b1ee-117dbce33222,QCOM,2022-11-12,QUALCOMM Incorporated (NASDAQ:QCOM) Stock Has Shown Weakness Lately But Financials Look Strong: Should Prospective Shareholders Make The Leap?,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/qualcomm-incorporated-nasdaq-qcom-stock-130240032.html,1668258160,STORY,['QCOM'],"[With its stock down 20% over the past three months, it is easy to disregard QUALCOMM (NASDAQ:QCOM). However, stock prices are usually driven by a company’s financial performance over the long term, which in this case looks quite promising. Particularly, we will be paying attention to QUALCOMM's  ROE today.Return on equity or ROE is a key measure used to assess how efficiently a company's management is utilizing the company's capital. Put another way, it reveals the company's success at turning shareholder investments into profits. View our latest analysis for QUALCOMM How To Calculate Return On Equity?Return on equity can be calculated by using the formula:Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' EquitySo, based on the above formula, the ROE for QUALCOMM is:72% = US$13b ÷ US$18b (Based on the trailing twelve months to September 2022).The 'return' is the amount earned after tax over the last twelve months. Another way to think of that is that for every $1 worth of equity, the company was able to earn $0.72 in profit.What Is The Relationship Between ROE And Earnings Growth?Thus far, we have learned that ROE measures how efficiently a company is generating its profits. Depending on how much of these profits the company reinvests or ""retains"", and how effectively it does so, we are then able to assess a company’s earnings growth potential. Assuming all else is equal, companies that have both a higher return on equity and higher profit retention are usually the ones that have a higher growth rate when compared to companies that don't have the same features.QUALCOMM's Earnings Growth And 72% ROEFirstly, we acknowledge that QUALCOMM has a significantly high ROE. Second, a comparison with the average ROE reported by the industry of 18% also doesn't go unnoticed by us. Under the circumstances, QUALCOMM's considerable five year net income growth of 54% was to be expected.We then compared QUALCOMM's net income growth with the industry and we're pleased to see that the company's growth figure is higher when compared with the industry which has a growth rate of 26% in the same period.Story continuespast-earnings-growthEarnings growth is an important metric to consider when valuing a stock. The investor should try to establish if the expected growth or decline in earnings, whichever the case may be, is priced in. By doing so, they will have an idea if the stock is headed into clear blue waters or if swampy waters await. Is QCOM fairly valued? This infographic on the company's intrinsic value  has everything you need to know.Is QUALCOMM Efficiently Re-investing Its Profits?QUALCOMM's three-year median payout ratio is a pretty moderate 37%, meaning the company retains 63% of its income. So it seems that QUALCOMM is reinvesting efficiently in a way that it sees impressive growth in its earnings (discussed above) and pays a dividend that's well covered.Besides, QUALCOMM has been paying dividends for at least ten years or more. This shows that the company is committed to sharing profits with its shareholders. Our latest analyst data shows that the future payout ratio of the company is expected to drop to 29% over the next three years. Regardless, the future ROE for QUALCOMM is predicted to decline to 37% despite the anticipated decrease in the payout ratio. We reckon that there could probably be other factors that could be driving the forseen decline in the company's ROE.ConclusionIn total, we are pretty happy with QUALCOMM's performance. Specifically, we like that the company is reinvesting a huge chunk of its profits at a high rate of return. This of course has caused the company to see substantial growth in its earnings. Having said that, on studying current analyst estimates, we were concerned to see that while the company has grown its earnings in the past, analysts expect its earnings to shrink in the future.

97,31609877-2f88-3991-95f7-a00821ce64f0,QCOM,2022-11-12,10 Growth Stocks in Billionaire George Soros’ Portfolio,Insider Monkey,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/10-growth-stocks-billionaire-george-223832235.html,1668206312,STORY,"['INTU', 'APTV', 'QCOM']","[We prepared the following article about the growth stocks in George Soros' 13F portfolio 4 months ago. We don't have to wait 4 months to figure out what would happen if we imitated George Soros' growth stock picks. The original article will be presented in quotations whereas our new comments will be in regular paragraphs:George Soros is an American investor and the founder of Soros Fund Management. Whenever George Soros makes an investment decision, the market notices it. In Q1 2022, the value of the billionaire’s US stock holdings saw a decrease of about $2 billion. The decline was driven by a lowering of his stake in Rivian Automotive, Inc. (NASDAQ:RIVN) and the closing of some of the major holdings, such as IHS Markit Ltd.George Soros was right about trimming his market exposure, dumping his IHS position whose stock lost 40% of its value, and cutting his stake in Rivian Automotive (RIVN) which lost a quarter of its value.Keeping in view the current economic situation, George Soros discouraged investors from investing in China as the country’s real estate boom was dying down. As reported by CNN in February, Soros stated that the “unsustainable” model had enticed many to invest in property and real estate companies at a time when China was finding itself in the middle of an economic crisis. To support his perspective, the billionaire discussed the case of Evergrande, a real estate group in China that is struggling to repay its liabilities due to stringent national policies.George Soros was also right about Chinese stocks as Chinese heavyweights like Alibaba (BABA) lost a third of its value since the end of the first quarter.Despite the economic certainty, Soros Fund Management has not taken refuge in defensive stocks like most investment firms in Q1 2022. Instead, the hedge fund has initiated new positions or increased its holdings in growth stocks that have been outperforming the broader market. The fund’s chief executive and chief investment officer, Dawn Fitzpatrick, stated that even though inflation is rising at a faster rate than the increase in wages, US consumer still has enough money to settle their credit card debts. In an interview with Bloomberg, Fitzpatrick appeared unfazed by the inevitable recession and added that “rate increases will slow the economy and will impact inflation, but this economy has some shock absorbers built-in.”Story continuesFitzpatrick was proven right over the last 6 months. We haven't seen any increase in unemployment rate and the US consumers are still very strong. Yet, the inflation rate finally started to come down. On the other hand, growth stocks haven't been doing well since the end of the first quarter.Out of the ten stocks covered in this article, Soros Fund Management has increased its stake in eight stocks either by initiating a new position or adding to its previous holdings. Unlike Warren Buffett, who believes in value investing in entities with strong fundamentals and financials with a long-term investment horizon, Soros is a contrarian and speculative investor who relies on short-term movements in the market. Some of the notable names included in Soros’ Q1 2022 portfolio are Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG), Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), and Salesforce, Inc. (NYSE:CRM).best high yield dividend stocks according to george sorosWe have used the first quarter portfolio of Soros Fund Management to select these stocks. Companies with strong business fundamentals and growth prospects have been analyzed. Furthermore, we have also mentioned the number of hedge fund holders for each stock to give investors an idea about the popularity of these companies amongst institutional investors. Over 900 elite funds were tracked by Insider Monkey at the end of Q1 2022 to determine the hedge fund sentiment.The five stocks that we covered below, Proterra Inc (PTRA), Qualcomm Incorporated (QCOM), Aptiv PLC (APTV), Intuit Inc (INTU), indie Semiconductor Inc. (INDI) lost an average of 6.5% since the end of the first quarter, but outperformed the S&amp;P 500 ETF (SPY)'s 11% loss during the same period. Let's take a look:10 Growth Stocks in Billionaire George Soros’ Portfolio10. Proterra Inc. (NASDAQ:PTRA)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 16Soros Fund Management’s Holdings: $21,922,000Percentage of Soros Fund Management’s Portfolio: 0.33%Stock Price as of June 30: $4.76Return since March 31: -8.5%Proterra Inc. (NASDAQ:PTRA) is a Burlingame, California-based commercial electric vehicles (EVs) designer and manufacturer that went public at the peak of the special purpose acquisition vehicle (SPAC) boom during Q2 2021. Proterra Inc. (NASDAQ:PTRA) has sold 1,300 buses to more than 135 transit agencies across 43 US and Canadian states since its inception. The company provides not only commercial EVs but also offers complete charging solutions.Proterra Inc. (NASDAQ:PTRA) stock has lost 70% of its value since its IPO and has been engulfed with ongoing supply chain issues. Soros Management’s current holding is still equivalent to 2% of the company, making it the third biggest hedge fund holder of the stock. Michael Shlisky at DA Davidson also has a positive outlook on Proterra Inc. (NASDAQ:PTRA) as he initiated coverage on the stock with a Buy rating and a price target of $10 in a note issued on June 1. The analyst considers Proterra Inc. (NASDAQ:PTRA) stock as one of the pre-vetted, quality EV-truck companies. Shlisky added that the organization is also coming up as a first-choice battery provider to manufacturers of electric trucks.As of Q1 2022, Proterra Inc. (NASDAQ:PTRA) was held by 16 hedge funds.9. QUALCOMM Incorporated (NASDAQ:QCOM)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 73Soros Fund Management’s Holdings: $23,571,000Percentage of Soros Fund Management’s Portfolio: 0.35%Stock Price as of June 30: $131.60Return since March 31: -19.7%QUALCOMM Incorporated (NASDAQ:QCOM) is a San Diego, California-based wireless technology company that produces critical components for 5G-enabled smartphones, electric vehicles, cameras, and smart homes.On June 28, the equity research team at Bank of America added QUALCOMM Incorporated (NASDAQ:QCOM) to the “US 1 List.” The list comprises the best publicly listed investment ideas across every sector of the economy. The company has a bright outlook as it has been reported that the Cupertino, California-based tech giant Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) has failed to come up with its own 5G chips for iPhones. Hence, it would have to rely upon QUALCOMM Incorporated (NASDAQ:QCOM) as its exclusive partner.QUALCOMM Incorporated (NASDAQ:QCOM) would be responsible for providing 100% of the chips for iPhones produced till the second half of the next year. This will surely provide an impetus to the top line and bottom line of the company. By the time Apple is prepared to replace Qualcomm’s chips in its devices, QUALCOMM Incorporated’s (NASDAQ:QCOM) other businesses would have matured and would counteract the adverse effect of losing the partnership.QUALCOMM Incorporated (NASDAQ:QCOM) was discussed in the Q4 2021 investor of ClearBridge Investments. Here’s what the firm said:“Market strength continued in the fourth quarter, with only the communication services sector down in the Russell 1000 Value Index. Portfolio returns benefited from the strong performance of semiconductor maker Qualcomm, which has executed exceptionally well in pursuing the transition to 5G, growing both content and share due to its leadership position in cellular technology. The chipmaker recently outlined a number of peripheral growth opportunities outside of mobile markets, including automotive (where it hopes to leverage its strong presence in the automotive infotainment space into advanced driver assistance systems), Internet of Things (including opportunities in the PC market, VR/AR market, and factory automation) and radio frequency (where mmWave adoption globally, including China, would drive substantial upside).”QUALCOMM Incorporated (NASDAQ:QCOM) was held by 73 funds at the end of Q1 2022.8.

The analyst gave the rating and target price, keeping in view the existing supply chain challenges in the short-term along with an anticipation of lower demand in the medium term. Delaney anticipates automobile production of 79 million in 2022 and 84 million in 2023 globally. The analyst lowered the US seasonal adjusted annual rate (SAAR) forecast to 14.5 million for 2022 due to rising interest rates and high inflation. Aptiv PLC (NYSE:APTV) is expected to be a beneficiary of faster EV adoption.Aptiv PLC (NYSE:APTV) was mentioned in the Q1 2022 investor letter of ClearBridge Investments. Here’s what the firm said:“The acceleration in electrification of transport should support electric vehicle (EV)-related stocks like Aptiv (NYSE:APTV), which came under pressure in the quarter on concerns the auto cycle is past its peak. Aptiv provides a range of solutions for the auto industry, including autonomous driving technologies, safety technologies, components, and wiring. The large exposure of APTV to EVs should lead to long-term value as EVs continue their growth, boosted by their relative attractiveness as prices at the pump hit near-historic highs.”Aptiv PLC (NYSE:APTV) was held by 48 elite funds at the end of Q1 2022.7.

(NASDAQ:INTU) is a Palo Alto, California-based software corporation that specializes in developing financial software.On May 25, Brad Reback at Stifel gave Intuit Inc. (NASDAQ:INTU) stock a Buy rating with a price target of $465. The analyst highlighted that the company delivered strong Q3 FY22 results despite a weak tax season. The impact of the weak tax season was countered by the strong performance of the company’s two brands, Credit Karma and Mailchimp. During the earnings calls, the management reiterated several times that the business is not getting impacted by economic uncertainty. However, Intuit Inc. (NASDAQ:INTU) is still exposed to a slowdown in the overall economy despite the size and diversity of its offerings ranging from Mint, QuickBooks, and TurboTax. Following the quarterly results, Intuit Inc. (NASDAQ:INTU) also raised its FY22 EPS guidance.Baron Funds discussed its stance on Intuit Inc. (NASDAQ:INTU) in its Q1 2022 investor letter. Here’s what the firm said:“At the company-specific level, with 59% of our holdings posting double-digit declines during the quarter, we had no chance to hold up against the Index that was down less than 5%. The good news is that for the most part, this draw-down did not result in a permanent loss of capital and in many cases, we believe fundamentals have remained robust or improved even though stock prices declined. One example is Intuit (NASDAQ:INTU), the leading provider of accounting software, and our second largest detractor in the quarter. The stock lost 25% of its value (or over $45 billion) due to a miss in quarterly revenues, which was driven by a slower start to the tax season, leading the company to miss consensus estimates for consumer revenues by about $190 million. The slower start to the tax season is of course insignificant to the intrinsic value of the business, as everyone knows there are only two certainties in life and one of them is – TAXES! And so, naturally, Intuit reaffirmed its annual projections. Moreover, results in other segments were ahead of expectations. CEO Sasan Goodarzi explained the outperformance during its quarterly conference call by saying:‘We have a nearly $300 billion addressable market driven by tailwinds that include a shift to virtual solutions, an acceleration to online and omni-channel capabilities, and digital money offerings. This, combined with the team’s excellence and execution is contributing to the strength of our performance.’More specifically, Intuit is gaining market share in tax filings (“we are on track to gain share overall again this season”), continues expanding its QuickBooks online offering, which was up 35% year-over-year, and is seeing strong synergies from its Credit Karma acquisition, driven by Intuit’s Lightbox technology, which allows better personalization of offerings to customers (for example, it “doubles the average approval rate for members who apply for credit cards on Credit Karma versus outside of Credit Karma”). The bottom line is that our estimates of Intuit’s intrinsic value were up while the stock price was down and therefore our future expected return has increased.”Overall, 82 funds held a stake in Intuit Inc. (NASDAQ:INTU) at the end of Q1 2022.6. indie Semiconductor, Inc.

In this article we are going to revisit our July 2022 thesis in each stock and report each stock's performance. These stocks outperformed the market by an average of 1 percentage point since then. Here is how we saw the investment landscape 3.5 months ago:Record inflation and rising interest rates contributed to a 0.9% contraction in the United States (US) economy during the second quarter of 2022, per data recently released by the Department of Commerce. The advance estimate, made by the Bureau of Economic Analysis, is slightly below the 1.6% contraction in the economy registered in the first quarter of the year. However, the second straight quarter of decline indicates that the markets are already in a recession, per a technical definition of the word not followed by policymakers in the US. Prominent stocks like Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META), Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG), and Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) are all trading lower as the market digests the news. Sal Guatieri, a senior economist at BMO Capital Markets, recently told investors in a research note that “four-decade high inflation, rapidly rising borrowing costs, and a general tightening in financial conditions” were the prime factors behind the slowing economy. Per the economist, the US economy was now “highly vulnerable to slipping into a recession”. Mark Zandi, the chief economist at Moody’s Analytics, is of the view that the economy is slowing but not in a recession yet. In the US, the National Bureau of Economic Research declares if the economy is in a recession by relying on a determination by a group of researchers that weigh a broad range of factors. However, it may be months before the bureau makes a judgment on the April-June quarter of 2022. Insiders are using the panic at the markets, which has resulted in a broad correction in the value of equities, to identify buying opportunities. Our MethodologyThe companies that saw an increase in the number of hedge fund holders in the first quarter of 2022, compared to data for the fourth quarter of 2021, and witnessed a more than 20% drop in their share price year-to-date were selected for the list. Data from around 900 elite hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey in the first quarter of 2022 was used to identify the number of hedge funds that hold stakes in each firm. Story continuesInsiders Are Buying the Dip on These 10 StocksSource: pexelsInsiders Are Buying the Dip on These Stocks10.

106,6c0bb6c0-3f63-3b62-a522-1e972be71ddb,GT,2022-11-12,Are Investors Undervaluing The Goodyear Tire & Rubber Company (NASDAQ:GT) By 50%?,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/investors-undervaluing-goodyear-tire-rubber-135228047.html,1668174748,STORY,['GT'],"[How far off is The Goodyear Tire &amp; Rubber Company (NASDAQ:GT) from its intrinsic value? Using the most recent financial data, we'll take a look at whether the stock is fairly priced by taking the expected future cash flows and discounting them to their present value. We will use the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model on this occasion. Believe it or not, it's not too difficult to follow, as you'll see from our example!We generally believe that a company's value is the present value of all of the cash it will generate in the future. However, a DCF is just one valuation metric among many, and it is not without flaws. Anyone interested in learning a bit more about intrinsic value should have a read of the Simply Wall St analysis model. Check out our latest analysis for Goodyear Tire &amp; Rubber The CalculationWe're using the 2-stage growth model, which simply means we take in account two stages of company's growth. In the initial period the company may have a higher growth rate and the second stage is usually assumed to have a stable growth rate. In the first stage we need to estimate the cash flows to the business over the next ten years. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.A DCF is all about the idea that a dollar in the future is less valuable than a dollar today, so we need to discount the sum of these future cash flows to arrive at a present value estimate:10-year free cash flow (FCF) forecast2023202420252026202720282029203020312032 Levered FCF ($, Millions) US$286.0mUS$407.5mUS$501.7mUS$585.8mUS$658.1mUS$718.8mUS$769.5mUS$812.1mUS$848.3mUS$879.9mGrowth Rate Estimate SourceAnalyst x3Analyst x2Est @ 23.11%Est @ 16.77%Est @ 12.33%Est @ 9.23%Est @ 7.05%Est @ 5.53%Est @ 4.47%Est @ 3.72% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 12% US$255US$323US$355US$369US$369US$360US$343US$322US$300US$277(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$3.3bStory continuesAfter calculating the present value of future cash flows in the initial 10-year period, we need to calculate the Terminal Value, which accounts for all future cash flows beyond the first stage. For a number of reasons a very conservative growth rate is used that cannot exceed that of a country's GDP growth. In this case we have used the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield (2.0%) to estimate future growth. In the same way as with the 10-year 'growth' period, we discount future cash flows to today's value, using a cost of equity of 12%.Terminal Value (TV)= FCF2032 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$880m× (1 + 2.0%) ÷ (12%– 2.0%) = US$8.7bPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$8.7b÷ ( 1 + 12%)10= US$2.8bThe total value is the sum of cash flows for the next ten years plus the discounted terminal value, which results in the Total Equity Value, which in this case is US$6.0b. In the final step we divide the equity value by the number of shares outstanding. Compared to the current share price of US$10.7, the company appears quite good value at a 50% discount to where the stock price trades currently. The assumptions in any calculation have a big impact on the valuation, so it is better to view this as a rough estimate, not precise down to the last cent.dcfThe AssumptionsThe calculation above is very dependent on two assumptions. The first is the discount rate and the other is the cash flows. You don't have to agree with these inputs, I recommend redoing the calculations yourself and playing with them. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Goodyear Tire &amp; Rubber as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 12%, which is based on a levered beta of 2.000. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.Looking Ahead:Whilst important, the DCF calculation is only one of many factors that you need to assess for a company. It's not possible to obtain a foolproof valuation with a DCF model. Instead the best use for a DCF model is to test certain assumptions and theories to see if they would lead to the company being undervalued or overvalued. If a company grows at a different rate, or if its cost of equity or risk free rate changes sharply, the output can look very different. What is the reason for the share price sitting below the intrinsic value? For Goodyear Tire &amp; Rubber, there are three further factors you should look at:Risks: Consider for instance, the ever-present spectre of investment risk.

108,e358496a-704d-35a1-965b-5b8ae8712b24,MRK,2022-11-12,Those who invested in Merck (NYSE:MRK) five years ago are up 118%,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/those-invested-merck-nyse-mrk-130229031.html,1668258149,STORY,['MRK'],"[Generally speaking the aim of active stock picking is to find companies that provide returns that are superior to the market average. And while active stock picking involves risks (and requires diversification) it can also provide excess returns. For example, long term Merck &amp; Co., Inc. (NYSE:MRK) shareholders have enjoyed a 77% share price rise over the last half decade, well in excess of the market return of around 47% (not including dividends). However, more recent returns haven't been as impressive as that, with the stock returning just 21% in the last year , including dividends .Let's take a look at the underlying fundamentals over the longer term, and see if they've been consistent with shareholders returns. Check out our latest analysis for Merck To paraphrase Benjamin Graham: Over the short term the market is a voting machine, but over the long term it's a weighing machine. One imperfect but simple way to consider how the market perception of a company has shifted is to compare the change in the earnings per share (EPS) with the share price movement.Over half a decade, Merck managed to grow its earnings per share at 42% a year. The EPS growth is more impressive than the yearly share price gain of 12% over the same period. So it seems the market isn't so enthusiastic about the stock these days.You can see how EPS has changed over time in the image below (click on the chart to see the exact values).earnings-per-share-growthWe know that Merck has improved its bottom line lately, but is it going to grow revenue? If you're interested, you could check this free report showing consensus revenue forecasts.What About Dividends?When looking at investment returns, it is important to consider the difference between total shareholder return (TSR) and share price return. The TSR is a return calculation that accounts for the value of cash dividends (assuming that any dividend received was reinvested) and the calculated value of any discounted capital raisings and spin-offs. Arguably, the TSR gives a more comprehensive picture of the return generated by a stock. As it happens, Merck's TSR for the last 5 years was 118%, which exceeds the share price return mentioned earlier. The dividends paid by the company have thusly boosted the total shareholder return.Story continuesA Different PerspectiveIt's good to see that Merck has rewarded shareholders with a total shareholder return of 21% in the last twelve months. And that does include the dividend. Since the one-year TSR is better than the five-year TSR (the latter coming in at 17% per year), it would seem that the stock's performance has improved in recent times. Someone with an optimistic perspective could view the recent improvement in TSR as indicating that the business itself is getting better with time. It's always interesting to track share price performance over the longer term. But to understand Merck better, we need to consider many other factors. For instance, we've identified   2 warning signs for Merck  that you should be aware of.But note: Merck may not be the best stock to buy.

109,9ddd6ee9-4ebf-3245-8eb4-e881249221ac,MRK,2022-11-12,Here is Why Growth Investors Should Buy Merck (MRK) Now,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/why-growth-investors-buy-merck-174505619.html,1668188705,STORY,['MRK'],"[Investors seek growth stocks to capitalize on above-average growth in financials that help these securities grab the market's attention and produce exceptional returns. But finding a great growth stock is not easy at all.By their very nature, these stocks carry above-average risk and volatility. Moreover, if a company's growth story is over or nearing its end, betting on it could lead to significant loss.However, the Zacks Growth Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which looks beyond the traditional growth attributes to analyze a company's real growth prospects, makes it pretty easy to find cutting-edge growth stocks.Our proprietary system currently recommends Merck (MRK) as one such stock. This company not only has a favorable Growth Score, but also carries a top Zacks Rank.Studies have shown that stocks with the best growth features consistently outperform the market. And for stocks that have a combination of a Growth Score of A or B and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy), returns are even better.While there are numerous reasons why the stock of this pharmaceutical company is a great growth pick right now, we have highlighted three of the most important factors below:Earnings GrowthEarnings growth is arguably the most important factor, as stocks exhibiting exceptionally surging profit levels tend to attract the attention of most investors. For growth investors, double-digit earnings growth is highly preferable, as it is often perceived as an indication of strong prospects (and stock price gains) for the company under consideration.While the historical EPS growth rate for Merck is 13.9%, investors should actually focus on the projected growth. The company's EPS is expected to grow 22.5% this year, crushing the industry average, which calls for EPS growth of 3.8%.Impressive Asset Utilization RatioAsset utilization ratio -- also known as sales-to-total-assets (S/TA) ratio -- is often overlooked by investors, but it is an important indicator in growth investing. This metric shows how efficiently a firm is utilizing its assets to generate sales.Story continuesRight now, Merck has an S/TA ratio of 0.55, which means that the company gets $0.55 in sales for each dollar in assets. Comparing this to the industry average of 0.53, it can be said that the company is more efficient.In addition to efficiency in generating sales, sales growth plays an important role. And Merck looks attractive from a sales growth perspective as well. The company's sales are expected to grow 17.7% this year versus the industry average of 2.7%.Promising Earnings Estimate RevisionsSuperiority of a stock in terms of the metrics outlined above can be further validated by looking at the trend in earnings estimate revisions. A positive trend is of course favorable here. Empirical research shows that there is a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.There have been upward revisions in current-year earnings estimates for Merck. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has surged 0.6% over the past month.Bottom LineMerck has not only earned a Growth Score of B based on a number of factors, including the ones discussed above, but it also carries a Zacks Rank #2 because of the positive earnings estimate revisions.You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.This combination indicates that Merck is a potential outperformer and a solid choice for growth investors.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Consumer spending slowed down because of a hawkish Fed, and consequently, economic growth was disrupted.However, signs of inflation cooling down in the month of October increased investors’ risk appetite, and stocks logged their best rally since 2020 on Nov 10. The Dow surged more than 1,200 points yesterday and closed at its highest level since August.Similarly, the broader S&amp;P 500 closed at its highest level since Sep 12, while the tech-laden Nasdaq registered its biggest one-day rise in percentage point terms since March 2020.The Bureau of Labor Statistics, in fact, noted that the consumer price index (CPI) increased 7.7% from a year ago in October. But the annual rise in inflation was down from September’s 8.2%. At the same time, the CPI increased less than expected in the prior month.What’s more, the core CPI, which excludes goods and service costs, rose 6.3% on an annual basis, slightly below September’s 6.6%, which was incidentally the highest year-over-year jump since August 1982.Nonetheless, thanks to such soft inflation data, the Fed is now widely expected to slow down its pace of rate hikes in the upcoming months, thereby propelling economic growth and boosting stock market returns.Lest we forget, the Fed has already approved its fourth-straight 0.75 percentage point rate hike in early November, taking the benchmark rate to between 3.75% and 4%, the highest in 14 years.Talking about stock market returns, the period from November to January usually bodes well for Wall Street. The S&amp;P 500, on average, advanced 4.5% in the said period since 1936, more than its overall three-month average gain of 2.9%, per quantitative analysts at the Bank of America, citing a MarketWatch article.Additionally, stocks tend to do well after midterm elections. As mentioned in the Schwab article, since 1946, in 17 out of 19 midterms, the stock market has given better returns in the six-month period following an election compared to the six months leading up to it. On Nov 8, Americans already voted, so it’s now expected that the stock market would steadily scale upward.Story continuesBanking on these positive developments, investors should place their bets on fundamentally sound growth stocks.

114,62563a8d-46c7-3e27-9fb0-b78168329894,WMB,2022-11-12,Those who invested in Williams Companies (NYSE:WMB) three years ago are up 87%,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/those-invested-williams-companies-nyse-140131669.html,1668175291,STORY,['WMB'],"[One simple way to benefit from the stock market is to buy an index fund. But many of us dare to dream of bigger returns, and build a portfolio ourselves. For example, The Williams Companies, Inc. (NYSE:WMB) shareholders have seen the share price rise 53% over three years, well in excess of the market return (25%, not including dividends). However, more recent returns haven't been as impressive as that, with the stock returning just 23% in the last year , including dividends .So let's assess the underlying fundamentals over the last 3 years and see if they've moved in lock-step with shareholder returns. Check out our latest analysis for Williams Companies To paraphrase Benjamin Graham: Over the short term the market is a voting machine, but over the long term it's a weighing machine. One way to examine how market sentiment has changed over time is to look at the interaction between a company's share price and its earnings per share (EPS).Williams Companies was able to grow its EPS at 136% per year over three years, sending the share price higher. The average annual share price increase of 15% is actually lower than the EPS growth. Therefore, it seems the market has moderated its expectations for growth, somewhat.You can see how EPS has changed over time in the image below (click on the chart to see the exact values).earnings-per-share-growthIt is of course excellent to see how Williams Companies has grown profits over the years, but the future is more important for shareholders. This free interactive report on Williams Companies' balance sheet strength is a great place to start, if you want to investigate the stock further.What About Dividends?It is important to consider the total shareholder return, as well as the share price return, for any given stock. The TSR is a return calculation that accounts for the value of cash dividends (assuming that any dividend received was reinvested) and the calculated value of any discounted capital raisings and spin-offs. So for companies that pay a generous dividend, the TSR is often a lot higher than the share price return. As it happens, Williams Companies' TSR for the last 3 years was 87%, which exceeds the share price return mentioned earlier. The dividends paid by the company have thusly boosted the total shareholder return.Story continuesA Different PerspectiveIt's nice to see that Williams Companies shareholders have received a total shareholder return of 23% over the last year. And that does include the dividend. That gain is better than the annual TSR over five years, which is 11%. Therefore it seems like sentiment around the company has been positive lately. In the best case scenario, this may hint at some real business momentum, implying that now could be a great time to delve deeper. It's always interesting to track share price performance over the longer term. But to understand Williams Companies better, we need to consider many other factors. Even so, be aware that  Williams Companies is showing  2 warning signs in our investment analysis , and 1 of those can't be ignored...We will like Williams Companies better if we see some big insider buys.

117,43143c72-978d-3b66-9baf-7facef17a04c,SO,2022-11-12,Investors Heavily Search Southern Company The (SO): Here is What You Need to Know,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/investors-heavily-search-southern-company-140002913.html,1668175202,STORY,['SO'],"[Southern Co. (SO) is one of the stocks most watched by Zacks.com visitors lately. So, it might be a good idea to review some of the factors that might affect the near-term performance of the stock.Shares of this power company have returned +2.6% over the past month versus the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's +9.6% change. The Zacks Utility - Electric Power industry, to which Southern Co. belongs, has gained 7.8% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?Although media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.Earnings Estimate RevisionsHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.Our analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.For the current quarter, Southern Co. is expected to post earnings of $0.24 per share, indicating a change of -33.3% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -1.4% over the last 30 days.For the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $3.60 points to a change of +5.6% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has changed -0.4%.Story continuesFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $3.78 indicates a change of +5.1% from what Southern Co. is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -0.5%.Having a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, Southern Co. is rated Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPS12-month consensus EPS estimate for SO _12MonthEPSChartUrlRevenue Growth ForecastEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.In the case of Southern Co. the consensus sales estimate of $6.01 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of +4.1%. The $27.07 billion and $28.22 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of +17.1% and +4.3%, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistorySouthern Co. reported revenues of $8.38 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +34.3%. EPS of $1.31 for the same period compares with $1.23 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $6.75 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +24.08%. The EPS surprise was -1.5%.Over the last four quarters, Southern Co. surpassed consensus EPS estimates three times. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.ValuationNo investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.Comparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.As part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.Southern Co. is graded C on this front, indicating that it is trading at par with its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.Bottom LineThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Southern Co. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Going by the price targets, the mean estimate of $209.08 indicates a potential upside of 27.6%.The average comprises 13 short-term price targets ranging from a low of $178 to a high of $232, with a standard deviation of $14.41. While the lowest estimate indicates an increase of 8.7% from the current price level, the most optimistic estimate points to a 41.6% upside. More than the range, one should note the standard deviation here, as it helps understand the variability of the estimates. The smaller the standard deviation, the greater the agreement among analysts.While the consensus price target is highly sought after by investors, the ability and unbiasedness of analysts in setting price targets have long been questionable. And investors making investment decisions solely based on this tool would arguably do themselves a disservice.But, for MAA, an impressive average price target is not the only indicator of a potential upside. Strong agreement among analysts about the company's ability to report better earnings than they predicted earlier strengthens this view. While a positive trend in earnings estimate revisions doesn't gauge how much a stock could gain, it has proven to be powerful in predicting an upside.Price, Consensus and EPS SurpriseZacks Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise Chart for MAAHere's What You Should Know About Analysts' Price TargetsAccording to researchers at several universities across the globe, a price target is one of many pieces of information about a stock that misleads investors far more often than it guides. In fact, empirical research shows that price targets set by several analysts, irrespective of the extent of agreement, rarely indicate where the price of a stock could actually be heading.Story continuesWhile Wall Street analysts have deep knowledge of a company's fundamentals and the sensitivity of its business to economic and industry issues, many of them tend to set overly optimistic price targets. Are you wondering why?They usually do that to drum up interest in shares of companies that their firms either have existing business relationships with or are looking to be associated with. In other words, business incentives of firms covering a stock often result in inflated price targets set by analysts.However, a tight clustering of price targets, which is represented by a low standard deviation, indicates that analysts have a high degree of agreement about the direction and magnitude of a stock's price movement. While that doesn't necessarily mean the stock will hit the average price target, it could be a good starting point for further research aimed at identifying the potential fundamental driving forces.That said, while investors should not entirely ignore price targets, making an investment decision solely based on them could lead to disappointing ROI. So, price targets should always be treated with a high degree of skepticism.Why MAA Could Witness a Solid UpsideThere has been increasing optimism among analysts lately about the company's earnings prospects, as indicated by strong agreement among them in revising EPS estimates higher. And that could be a legitimate reason to expect an upside in the stock. After all, empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has increased 2.3%, as two estimates have moved higher compared to no negative revision.Moreover, MAA currently has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), which means it is in the top 20% of more than the 4,000 stocks that we rank based on four factors related to earnings estimates. Given an impressive externally-audited track record, this is a more conclusive indication of the stock's potential upside in the near term. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stocks here &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Therefore, while the consensus price target may not be a reliable indicator of how much MAA could gain, the direction of price movement it implies does appear to be a good guide.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

(NYSE:NKE)",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/look-fair-value-nike-inc-140011281.html,1668175211,STORY,['NKE'],"[In this article we are going to estimate the intrinsic value of NIKE, Inc. (NYSE:NKE) by estimating the company's future cash flows and discounting them to their present value. The Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model is the tool we will apply to do this. Believe it or not, it's not too difficult to follow, as you'll see from our example!We generally believe that a company's value is the present value of all of the cash it will generate in the future. However, a DCF is just one valuation metric among many, and it is not without flaws. Anyone interested in learning a bit more about intrinsic value should have a read of the Simply Wall St analysis model. Check out our latest analysis for NIKE Is NIKE Fairly Valued?We are going to use a two-stage DCF model, which, as the name states, takes into account two stages of growth. The first stage is generally a higher growth period which levels off heading towards the terminal value, captured in the second 'steady growth' period. In the first stage we need to estimate the cash flows to the business over the next ten years. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.A DCF is all about the idea that a dollar in the future is less valuable than a dollar today, and so the sum of these future cash flows is then discounted to today's value:10-year free cash flow (FCF) forecast2023202420252026202720282029203020312032 Levered FCF ($, Millions) US$4.74bUS$5.63bUS$6.76bUS$7.45bUS$8.50bUS$9.27bUS$9.91bUS$10.5bUS$10.9bUS$11.3bGrowth Rate Estimate SourceAnalyst x9Analyst x10Analyst x8Analyst x2Analyst x2Est @ 9.07%Est @ 6.94%Est @ 5.45%Est @ 4.41%Est @ 3.68% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 7.6% US$4.4kUS$4.9kUS$5.4kUS$5.6kUS$5.9kUS$6.0kUS$5.9kUS$5.8kUS$5.6kUS$5.4k(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$55bStory continuesThe second stage is also known as Terminal Value, this is the business's cash flow after the first stage. The Gordon Growth formula is used to calculate Terminal Value at a future annual growth rate equal to the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield of 2.0%. We discount the terminal cash flows to today's value at a cost of equity of 7.6%.Terminal Value (TV)= FCF2032 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$11b× (1 + 2.0%) ÷ (7.6%– 2.0%) = US$205bPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$205b÷ ( 1 + 7.6%)10= US$98bThe total value, or equity value, is then the sum of the present value of the future cash flows, which in this case is US$153b. The last step is to then divide the equity value by the number of shares outstanding. Relative to the current share price of US$99.5, the company appears around fair value at the time of writing. Valuations are imprecise instruments though, rather like a telescope - move a few degrees and end up in a different galaxy. Do keep this in mind.dcfImportant AssumptionsNow the most important inputs to a discounted cash flow are the discount rate, and of course, the actual cash flows. You don't have to agree with these inputs, I recommend redoing the calculations yourself and playing with them. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at NIKE as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 7.6%, which is based on a levered beta of 1.097. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.Moving On:Valuation is only one side of the coin in terms of building your investment thesis, and it shouldn't be the only metric you look at when researching a company. DCF models are not the be-all and end-all of investment valuation. Instead the best use for a DCF model is to test certain assumptions and theories to see if they would lead to the company being undervalued or overvalued. For example, changes in the company's cost of equity or the risk free rate can significantly impact the valuation. For NIKE, we've compiled three essential factors you should further examine:Financial Health: Does NKE have a healthy balance sheet?

That is, insiders sold the stock in greater numbers than they purchased it.While insider transactions are not the most important thing when it comes to long-term investing, we would consider it foolish to ignore insider transactions altogether. View our latest analysis for Wells Fargo The Last 12 Months Of Insider Transactions At Wells FargoIn the last twelve months, the biggest single sale by an insider was when the insider, Kleber Santos, sold US$1.0m worth of shares at a price of US$44.44 per share. That means that even when the share price was below the current price of US$47.55, an insider wanted to cash in some shares. When an insider sells below the current price, it suggests that they considered that lower price to be fair. That makes us wonder what they think of the (higher) recent valuation. While insider selling is not a positive sign, we can't be sure if it does mean insiders think the shares are fully valued, so it's only a weak sign. We note that the biggest single sale was 51% of Kleber Santos's holding. Kleber Santos was the only individual insider to sell over the last year.You can see a visual depiction of insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last 12 months, below.

I reckon it's a good sign if insiders own a significant number of shares in the company. Wells Fargo insiders own about US$136m worth of shares (which is 0.07% of the company). I like to see this level of insider ownership, because it increases the chances that management are thinking about the best interests of shareholders.Story continuesWhat Might The Insider Transactions At Wells Fargo Tell Us?The fact that there have been no Wells Fargo insider transactions recently certainly doesn't bother us. It's great to see high levels of insider ownership, but looking back over the last year, we don't gain confidence from the Wells Fargo insiders selling. In addition to knowing about insider transactions going on, it's beneficial to identify the risks facing Wells Fargo.

(NYSE:PFE) is a favorite amongst the big guns",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/70-institutional-ownership-pfizer-inc-130013351.html,1668258013,STORY,['PFE'],"[Every investor in Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE) should be aware of the most powerful shareholder groups. With 70% stake, institutions possess the maximum shares in the company. That is, the group stands to benefit the most if the stock rises (or lose the most if there is a downturn).Given the vast amount of money and research capacities at their disposal, institutional ownership tends to carry a lot of weight, especially with individual investors. Therefore, a good portion of institutional money invested in the company is usually a huge vote of confidence on its future.In the chart below, we zoom in on the different ownership groups of Pfizer. See our latest analysis for Pfizer ownership-breakdownWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Pfizer?Institutions typically measure themselves against a benchmark when reporting to their own investors, so they often become more enthusiastic about a stock once it's included in a major index. We would expect most companies to have some institutions on the register, especially if they are growing.We can see that Pfizer does have institutional investors; and they hold a good portion of the company's stock. This suggests some credibility amongst professional investors. But we can't rely on that fact alone since institutions make bad investments sometimes, just like everyone does. If multiple institutions change their view on a stock at the same time, you could see the share price drop fast. It's therefore worth looking at Pfizer's earnings history below. Of course, the future is what really matters.earnings-and-revenue-growthSince institutional investors own more than half the issued stock, the board will likely have to pay attention to their preferences. Pfizer is not owned by hedge funds. The company's largest shareholder is The Vanguard Group, Inc., with ownership of 8.7%. With 7.8% and 5.4% of the shares outstanding respectively, BlackRock, Inc. and Capital Research and Management Company are the second and third largest shareholders.Story continuesOur studies suggest that the top 25 shareholders collectively control less than half of the company's shares, meaning that the company's shares are widely disseminated and there is no dominant shareholder.Researching institutional ownership is a good way to gauge and filter a stock's expected performance. The same can be achieved by studying analyst sentiments. There are a reasonable number of analysts covering the stock, so it might be useful to find out their aggregate view on the future.Insider Ownership Of PfizerWhile the precise definition of an insider can be subjective, almost everyone considers board members to be insiders. The company management answer to the board and the latter should represent the interests of shareholders. Notably, sometimes top-level managers are on the board themselves.Insider ownership is positive when it signals leadership are thinking like the true owners of the company. However, high insider ownership can also give immense power to a small group within the company. This can be negative in some circumstances.Our data suggests that insiders own under 1% of Pfizer Inc. in their own names. Being so large, we would not expect insiders to own a large proportion of the stock. Collectively, they own US$97m of stock. Arguably recent buying and selling is just as important to consider. You can  click here to see if insiders have been buying or selling. General Public OwnershipWith a 30% ownership, the general public, mostly comprising of individual investors, have some degree of sway over Pfizer. While this group can't necessarily call the shots, it can certainly have a real influence on how the company is run.Next Steps:While it is well worth considering the different groups that own a company, there are other factors that are even more important. For example, we've discovered 1 warning sign for Pfizer that you should be aware of before investing here.Ultimately the future is most important.

The vaccine can be given as a booster for preventing COVID-19 in adults aged 18 years and older. The vaccine has been developed in partnership with GSK GSK.Following the EC approval, VidPrevtyn Beta can be used as a booster dose in adults who have already been vaccinated with an mRNA-based vaccine developed by Pfizer PFE/BioNTech BNTX and Moderna or an adenoviral vaccine developed by AstraZeneca. Per Sanofi/GSK, the vaccine doses are ready to be shipped to member states of the EU.The EC decision follows the positive opinion issued by the European Medicines Agency’s (EMA) Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) which also recommended approving the vaccine. The EC decision came a couple of hours after the CHMP recommended the vaccine. The EC and CHMP decisions are based on data from two immunobridging studies, which compared the immune response generated by the Sanofi/GSK partnered vaccine against authorized mRNA-based or adenoviral vaccines.Based on its analysis of data, the CHMP and EC concluded that a booster dose of VidPrevtyn Beta is expected to be at least as effective as Pfizer/BioNTech’s Comirnaty at restoring protection against COVID-19.Shares of Sanofi have lost 11.6% this year against the industry’s 3.7% rise.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchVidPrevtyn Beta has been developed by Sanofi using its recombinant-protein technology platform and modeled on the Beta variant. The vaccine also utilizes GSK’s pandemic adjuvant platform.We note that the approval comes when the COVID-19 infections are waning.

But he hasn’t done much in the way of addressing employees directly. That changed Thursday when he gathered employees for a Q&amp;A session.Musk told Twitter staff he wants them to work with a “maniacal sense of urgency” because “we are headed into, I think, quite a serious recession,” according to The Verge, which acquired a recording of Musk’s comments.The world’s richest man recalled the stress he felt in previous economic downturns as the cofounder of X.com, which later became PayPal, and the CEO of Tesla.“I’ve been through the recession of 2000 and 2001 and 2008–9, and I’m somewhat paranoid about dying in recessions. I have recession PTSD from keeping X and PayPal alive through the 2000 recession, keeping Tesla alive in the 2009 recession. It’s worth remembering that in 2009, General Motors and Chrysler both went bankrupt. Tesla did not, despite being a startup electric vehicle company. It was excruciatingly difficult to keep us alive in 2009. And the reason we were able to keep alive is partly by just being paranoid.”After taking over Twitter, Musk fired around 50% of the company within a chaotic 24-hour period. And this week, several top managers at the company have resigned, including chief compliance officer Marianne Fobarty, chief information security officer Lea Kissner, and chief privacy officer Damien Kieran.The upheaval under Musk at Twitter has made other tech leaders, like Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg, look more empathetic by comparison.This week, Facebook owner Meta announced that around 11,000 employees, roughly 13% of staff, are being let go. Payments firm Stripe, hard-drive maker Seagate, and online lender Upstart, among others, also recently announced staff reductions and belt-tightening.But while Musk urged his remaining Twitter employees to work tirelessly, he also mentioned the possibility of the entire company going under.Story continues“We just definitely need to bring in more cash than we spend. If we don’t do that and there’s a massive negative cash flow, then bankruptcy is not out of the question. That is a priority. We can’t scale to 1 billion users and take massive losses along the way. That’s not feasible. I don’t think we will.”Musk also pointed to the need to boost subscriptions and the problem of Twitter relying too much on advertising in a recession:“In a recession, advertising is disproportionately affected. And then advertising where the advertiser cannot clearly trace how much they spent on an ad to what demand it generated, which is known as brand advertising, will be even more affected. This puts Twitter as we look ahead into a very dire situation from a revenue standpoint.”He noted that he sold a “bunch of Tesla stock” that is “going to be worth an immense amount in the future” in order to “keep Twitter alive.”“There’s going to be probably a year or two of serious recession that, again, will disproportionately affect us,” he added. “And we’re going to get through that and not be dead.”Those words will offer little comfort, of course, to the thousands of Twitter employees he let go.This story was originally featured on Fortune.comMore from Fortune: The U.S. housing market to see second biggest correction of the post-WWII era—when to expect the home price bottomSam Bankman-Fried’s failed crypto empire ‘was run by a gang of kids in the Bahamas’ who all dated each otherCOVID cases are on the rise again this autumn.

Wall Street Analysts Think 53%,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/much-upside-left-paypal-pypl-145502856.html,1668178502,STORY,"['PYPL', 'TGT']","[Paypal (PYPL) closed the last trading session at $86.80, gaining 3.3% over the past four weeks, but there could be plenty of upside left in the stock if short-term price targets set by Wall Street analysts are any guide. The mean price target of $133.06 indicates a 53.3% upside potential.The average comprises 34 short-term price targets ranging from a low of $93 to a high of $270, with a standard deviation of $33.28. While the lowest estimate indicates an increase of 7.1% from the current price level, the most optimistic estimate points to a 211.1% upside. More than the range, one should note the standard deviation here, as it helps understand the variability of the estimates. The smaller the standard deviation, the greater the agreement among analysts.While the consensus price target is highly sought after by investors, the ability and unbiasedness of analysts in setting price targets have long been questionable. And investors making investment decisions solely based on this tool would arguably do themselves a disservice.But, for PYPL, an impressive average price target is not the only indicator of a potential upside. Strong agreement among analysts about the company's ability to report better earnings than they predicted earlier strengthens this view. While a positive trend in earnings estimate revisions doesn't gauge how much a stock could gain, it has proven to be powerful in predicting an upside.Price, Consensus and EPS SurpriseZacks Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise Chart for PYPLHere's What You May Not Know About Analysts' Price TargetsAccording to researchers at several universities across the globe, a price target is one of many pieces of information about a stock that misleads investors far more often than it guides. In fact, empirical research shows that price targets set by several analysts, irrespective of the extent of agreement, rarely indicate where the price of a stock could actually be heading.While Wall Street analysts have deep knowledge of a company's fundamentals and the sensitivity of its business to economic and industry issues, many of them tend to set overly optimistic price targets. Are you wondering why?Story continuesThey usually do that to drum up interest in shares of companies that their firms either have existing business relationships with or are looking to be associated with. In other words, business incentives of firms covering a stock often result in inflated price targets set by analysts.However, a tight clustering of price targets, which is represented by a low standard deviation, indicates that analysts have a high degree of agreement about the direction and magnitude of a stock's price movement. While that doesn't necessarily mean the stock will hit the average price target, it could be a good starting point for further research aimed at identifying the potential fundamental driving forces.That said, while investors should not entirely ignore price targets, making an investment decision solely based on them could lead to disappointing ROI. So, price targets should always be treated with a high degree of skepticism.Why PYPL Could Witness a Solid UpsideThere has been increasing optimism among analysts lately about the company's earnings prospects, as indicated by strong agreement among them in revising EPS estimates higher. And that could be a legitimate reason to expect an upside in the stock. After all, empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.For the current year, 13 estimates have moved higher over the last 30 days while one has gone lower. As a result, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has increased 6.9%.Moreover, PYPL currently has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), which means it is in the top 20% of more than the 4,000 stocks that we rank based on four factors related to earnings estimates. Given an impressive externally-audited track record, this is a more conclusive indication of the stock's potential upside in the near term. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stocks here &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Therefore, while the consensus price target may not be a reliable indicator of how much PYPL could gain, the direction of price movement it implies does appear to be a good guide.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

136,7e37ce5f-61f3-332c-840d-bb8a512f9fab,MPC,2022-11-12,October CPI Data Raises Hope for a Soft Landing: 5 Top Picks,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/october-cpi-data-raises-hope-125912688.html,1668171552,STORY,"['MCK', 'HUM', 'CAT', 'MPC', 'COMP', '^GSPC', '^RUT', 'ORLY']","[Nov 10 ushered in a silver lining for Wall Street behind the dark clouds seen in 2022. The Bureau of Labor Statistics reported that the consumer price index (CPI) for October came lighter than market’s expectation, and U.S. stock markets shot up on the belief that the peak of inflation is behind us.October’s CPI data has significantly strengthened the ongoing Wall Street rally that started last month and paved the way for a year-end rally too. Historically, the last two months of any year have been favorable for investors. Moreover, the global financial market is abuzz  with a rumor that China may reopen from COVID-19 restrictions.Therefore, the stage has been set for a bull run unless any external shock like a geopolitical conflict creates a hurdle. To gain from this ongoing rally, we have selected five U.S. corporate giants with a favorable Zacks Rank and strong business potential for the rest of 2022. These are — Caterpillar Inc. CAT, McKesson Corp. MCK, Marathon Petroleum Corp. MPC, O'Reilly Automotive Inc. ORLY and Humana Inc. HUM.Inflation Seems to be DwindlingThe Department of Labor reported that CPI in October rose 0.4% month over month and 7.7% year over year. The consensus estimate was 0.5% for the month-over-month rise and 7.9% for the year-over-year gain. Core CPI (excluding volatile food and energy items) increased 0.3% month over month and 6.3% year over year. The consensus estimate was of a rise of 0.5% month over month and 6.5% year over year.The decline in CPI and core CPI may be marginal but peak inflation seems behind us. In fact, economic indicators like a tepid housing sector, declining commodity prices (except food and energy), growing accumulation of inventories on the part of manufacturers and retailers, gradual slowdown of the ISM manufacturing PMI and a decline in the job openings rate were pointing to the cooling down of the U.S. economy.Consequently, the three major stock indexes  — the Dow, the S&amp;P 500 and the Nasdaq Composite — rallied 3.7%, 5.5% and 7.4%, respectively, marking their best single-day performance in more than 30 months. The small-cap benchmark — the Russell 2000 — also surged 6.1%.Story continuesCan Fed Delivers a Soft Landing?After the release of the October CPI data, the CME FedWatch shows that there exists an 80.6% probability, against a 56.8% probability just a day ago that the Fed will raise the benchmark lending rate by 50 basis points in December.The ICE U.S. Dollar Index (DXY), which measures the greenback’s strength against a basket of six major currencies, fell 2.4% to 107.85 from 113 in Nov 3. The index soared to its 20-year high of 114.24 in Sep 27. Global financial markets were rattled by a skyrocketing dollar. The yield on the benchmark 10-Year U.S. Treasury Note dropped 33 basis points to 3.828%. The interest-rate-sensitive yield on the short-term 2-Year U.S. Treasury Note fell 30 basis points to 4.32%. Investors were highly concerned about an imminent recession due to the soaring risk-free market rate.Moreover, U.S. GDP has grown 2.6% in the third quarter, beating the consensus estimate of 2.2%. Market participants were worried that the economy might enter into a recession after it contracted in the first two quarters of this year.The labor market is currently at the pre-pandemic level with an unemployment rate of 3.7%. Finally, despite several major headwinds, the overall management guidance in the third-quarter 2022 earnings season was fairly good.Therefore, a strong U.S. economy and slowing inflation may enable the Fed to perform the herculean task of a soft landing of the economy.Our Top PicksWe have narrowed our search to five U.S. corporate behemoths with solid growth potential. These companies have seen positive earnings estimate revision in the last seven days indicating that the market is expecting them to do robust business in the near term. Each of our picks carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.The chart below shows the price performance of our five picks in the past three months.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchMarathon Petroleum is poised for further price gains based on a slew of positives. MPC’s $21 billion sales of its Speedway retail business provided it with a much-needed cash infusion. The deal also comes with a 15-year fuel-supply agreement under which Marathon Petroleum will supply 7.7 billion gallons of gasoline per year to 7-Eleven, thus ensuring a steady revenue stream.MPC’s exposure to more stable cash flows from the logistics segment diversifies the earnings stream and offers a buffer against the volatile refining business. Consequently, Marathon Petroleum is primed for significant capital appreciation and is viewed as a preferred downstream operator to own now.Marathon Petroleum has an expected earnings growth rate of more than 100% for the current year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings has improved 1.4% over the last seven days.McKesson provides pharmaceuticals and medical supplies in the United States and internationally. The strong fiscal first-quarter show by three of the four segments of MCK is encouraging. A strong earnings outlook for fiscal 2023 instill optimism.Strong adjusted operating profit growth across the key segments of MCK is encouraging. A strong position in the Distribution market continues to favor the stock. McKesson played a crucial role in the COVID-19 response efforts in the United States and abroad via the distribution of COVID-19 vaccines, ancillary supply kits, and COVID-19 tests.McKesson has an expected earnings growth rate of 4.5% for the current year (ending March 2023). The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings has improved 0.6% over the last seven days.Humana’s Medicaid business, buoyed by several contract wins and renewals, has been strongly contributing to its top line for years. Buyouts and alliances place HUM well for growth. Humana has been deploying excess capital for several years on balance sheet strength. HUM’s solid contributions from the Retail and Healthcare Services units are its major positives.Humana has an expected earnings growth rate of 21.3% for the current year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings has improved 0.1% over the last seven days.Caterpillar’s revenues and earnings grew year over year for six straight quarters thanks to its cost-saving actions, strong end-market demand and pricing actions that offset the impact of the ongoing supply chain snarls and cost pressures. We expect CAT’s adjusted earnings per share for 2022 to grow 11.6%, while revenues are predicted to rise 11.2%. The Construction Industries segment is expected to benefit from the rising construction activities in the United States and other parts of the world.Backed by demand for commodities fueled by the energy-transition trend, a thriving mining sector will aid the Resource Industries segment. CAT’s dividend yield and payout ratio are higher than its peers. A strong liquidity position, investments in expanding services and digital initiatives will help Caterpillar deliver outsized returns.Caterpillar has an expected earnings growth rate of 24.8% for the current year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings improved 0.6% over the last seven days.O'Reilly Automotive has been generating record revenues for 29 consecutive years on the back of growth in the auto parts market.

The stock market has reported negative returns for three consecutive quarters this year for the first time since the global financial crisis of 2009, according to a report by New York Times. The report also mentioned that the S&amp;P 500 ended the quarter with an over 5% decline, which has pushed investors towards defensive stocks. In this regard, dividend stocks like Merck &amp; Co., Inc. (NYSE:MRK), AbbVie Inc.

In the past 15 years ending August 2022, the average dividend growth rate stood at 13.71%, compared with a 2.21% growth in the Consumer Price Index (CPI) during the same period, according to S&amp;P Global. The report also highlighted that dividends now represent 6.25% of an income source, growing from 2.88% in 1981.Another report by Sterling Capital mentioned that dividend growers outperformed their peers when inflation ranged between 4% to 13% annually over the past five decades. Analysts recommend dividend stocks due to the compounding effects of dividend income and price appreciation. Over the past 30 years ending December 2021, reinvested dividends for the S&amp;P 500 represented nearly 50% of the total equity market, according to iShares.

We believe Caterpillar stands to benefit from increased capital investment supported by a healthier/recovering end market environment, particularly in construction and mining.”11. A. O.

Approximately 80% of demand is replacing existing heaters and 20% is tied to new construction. The company continues to benefit from a shift towards higher efficiency, but more expensive, tankless heaters.A.O. Smith generates returns on invested capital in the high teens. The company uses its earnings to consistently grow its dividends and share repurchases. Over the past three years the company’s performance has been hurt by its exposure to China as its business there suffered due to the US-China trade war and poor execution. We believe the China business is back on track and the all-important US business is doing better than ever as housing demand heats up in the US. The company beat earnings estimates over the past several quarters and is currently enjoying very good performance as the hot U.S housing market continues to be strong.19 A.O.

138,ee088af5-22ba-3028-83c0-874ea39e8b37,MKC,2022-11-12,7 No-Brainer Retirement Stocks to Buy for 2023 and Beyond,InvestorPlace,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/7-no-brainer-retirement-stocks-234409961.html,1667951049,STORY,"['MKC-V', 'KMI', 'BCBP', 'BRK-B', 'IBM', 'AAPL', 'MRK']","[The incredible volatility in the market can open doors for investors looking at various income-generating opportunities right now. In the world of stocks, a number of high-quality retirement-centric investments should be on the radar, given the market’s tilt toward defensive, lower-risk assets. Right now, investing in no-brainer retirement stocks regardless of the market downturn may be the painful, yet profitable, action.I define no-brainer retirement stocks as those companies with an incredibly consistent track record of rewarding shareholders. These rewards can include dividends, share buybacks, or capital appreciation over time. Investing in such stocks will enable investors to grow their wealth and ensure a smooth retirement.It’s often the more established ideas that flourish as retirement stocks. Consequently, in compiling this list, you’ll find some of the most popular names in the stock market that continue to grow investor wealth at a remarkable pace each year. That said, let’s look at seven no-brainer retirement stocks you should wager on for the long-haul.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsBCBPBCB Bancorp$19.83AAPLApple$141.19BRK-BBerkshire Hathaway$294.15MRKMerck$101.55KMIKinder Morgan$18.38IBMInternational Business Machines$140.66MKCMcCormick &amp; Co.$81.28BCB Bancorp (BCBP)An image of a solar panel in the shape of a piggy bank on a rooftop; concept for solar stocksSource: Andreas Prott / ShutterstockBCB Bancorp (NASDAQ:BCBP) is a leading regional bank with branches spread across New Jersey and New York. BCBP stock offers investors a solid forward dividend yield of 3.2%, with two years of dividend expansion. Moreover, the company’s payout ratio of 24.6% indicates massive room for dividend growth. Also, the stock sports a low valuation, trading at 2.8-times forward sales.In its most recent quarter, BCB posted a healthy 24% bump in revenues, with considerable expansion in net incomes. The company reported stellar loan growth in the first nine months this year and is expected to see strong growth and margin expansion over the next several months. Furthermore, the firm is investing heavily in its digital capabilities, which should solidify its balance sheet.Story continuesApple (AAPL)An Apple MacBook Air laptop sitting under bright purple lights.Source: WeDesing / Shutterstock.comConsumer electronics giant Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) has been an incredible business and wealth compounder for long-term investors. Apple’s eye-catching shareholder rewards have been driven by its robust business, which continues to produce consistently-growing earnings and revenues. Looking at APPL stock’s impressive 250% rise over the past few years, it’s easy to forget about the rather lackluster performance this stock (and the market in general) has seen of late.Interestingly, Apple is one of the few tech companies that pays a quarterly dividend. This dividend distribution has grown for nine consecutive years, now yielding roughly 0.6%. Moreover, the company is a heavy purchaser of its own shares, buying back more of its stock than any other entity in the U.S. Last year, it spent a whopping $85.5 billion in buybacks, and followed it up with $90 billion in 2022. With its business as strong as ever, I expect that number to grow consistently for the foreseeable future, making AAPL stock a no-brainer retirement investment.Berkshire Hathaway (BRK-B)A Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.A, BRK.B) sign sits out front of an office in Lafayette, Indiana.Source: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.comInvesting mogul Warren Buffett isn’t infallible, but his impeccable track record as the CEO of conglomerate Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRK-B) suggests otherwise. Under his leadership, Berkshire has delivered a spectacular 20.1% annual average return, making it one of the most attractive long-term holdings for any investor.Buffet has done a remarkable job of picking stocks that have stood the test of time and continue to deliver above-average returns. Berkshire’s investment portfolio includes multiple cyclical stocks that align with the U.S. economy. Periods of expansion are typically much longer than recessions, making cyclical stocks tremendous bets.Another aspect of the company portfolio is it’s packed with reliable dividend stocks. The company will collect more than $5 billion in dividend income this year, which adds a superb buffer, given the current economic climate.Merck (MRK)Merck (MRK) logo outside of corporate buildingSource: Atmosphere1 / Shutterstock.comMerck (NYSE:MRK) is one of the most successful and profitable drug makers that has flown under the radar due to the buzz surrounding the coronavirus vaccines. Merck’s most popular drug in its portfolio is Keytruda, a lucrative cancer treatment that forms a huge portion of its colossal revenue base. Moreover, the company’s Papillomavirus vaccine called Gardasil has impressively complemented sales of Keytruda over the years. Hence, Merck boasts a marvelous track record, growing sales and EBITDA by 9.5% and 15.5%, respectively, year-over-year.In its most recent quarter, company sales shot up 14% from the prior-year period to $14 billion, generating earnings per share of $1.85, 14 cents over consensus estimates. Sales from Keytruda climbed 26% to $5.4 billion, while Gardasil’s sales rose 20% on a year-over-year basis, excluding a $2.3 billion charge. Its magnificent results have allowed Merck to maintain its A-graded dividend profile, with a dividend yield of over 2.7% and 11 consecutive years of growth in its payouts.Kinder Morgan (KMI)Kinder Morgan logo on a sign outside the company headquarters in Houston.Source: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock.comKinder Morgan (NYSE:KMI) is a top midstream player in the energy sector. The company has interests in or owns 141 terminals, as well as 83,000 miles of pipelines. The current robust pricing environment for commodities has allowed the firm to produce stellar results in recent quarters. Indeed, I think the recent strength we’ve seen in fuel prices is likely to continue for the foreseeable future, making Kinder Morgan a business that’s relatively resilient to economic headwinds.Furthermore, the company’s distributable cash flows are growing at an impressive pace, indicative of the quality of its business. And distribute its cash flows Kinder Morgan has. The energy giant currently offers a remarkably 6.1% forward dividend yield with 5 years of consecutive growth in payouts. Moreover, the company paid out roughly 56.6% of its distributable cash flows as dividends, which gives it enough room to grow its payments while also making new investments in its pipeline infrastructure.International Business Machines (IBM)Quantum computing stocks: Sign of IBM with Canada Head Office Building in background in Markham, Ontario, Canada. IBM is an American multinational technology company.Source: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock.comTech giant International Business Machines (NYSE:IBM) had long been considered an afterthought in the tech sector. Its competition had embraced the changes in the this sector, investing in new areas such as the blockchain, cloud computing, and the Internet of Things. At the same time, Big Blue maintained its popular hardware business. However, over the past couple of years, its brand has evolved and has forayed into new profitable tech industries.Also, with IMB being a predominantly business-to-business enterprise, it has effectively shielded itself from the weaker elements of the market, such as consumer-facing offerings. The company is witnessing strong growth in the new elements of its business portfolio, including key growth areas of consulting, infrastructure, and software. Moreover, IBM offers an attractive forward yield of around 5%, and its investors have enjoyed 22 years of consecutive dividend increases.McCormick &amp; Co. (MKC)healthy food uncluding salmon, broccoli, tomatoes, nuts and moreMcCormick &amp; Co. (NYSE:MKC) is a leading producer of spices, condiments, and seasonings. Its brand is tied to the food industry, which enables McComick’s business to enjoy stable demand. Growth and stability are shown in its operating performance over the past five years, where it has grown its sales and earnings by single-digit margins.The firm has expanded organically and through strategic acquisitions. Moreover, McCormick’s investment in its sales channels has allowed it to grow sales without compromising on its margins. Gross margins have dropped slightly over the years, but it hasn’t been anything too concerning. With its strong business performance, MKC offers a forward dividend yield of just under 2% and boasts 36 years of consecutive dividend increases, making this stock a dividend aristocrat worth considering for investors nearing retirement.On the date of publication, Muslim Farooque did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.Muslim Farooque is a keen investor and an optimist at heart.

Today's Research Daily features new research reports on 16 major stocks, including Amazon.com, Inc. (AMZN), Sanofi (SNY) and Target Corporation (TGT). These research reports have been hand-picked from the roughly 70 reports published by our analyst team today.You can see all of today’s research reports here &gt;&gt;&gt;Shares of Amazon.com have declined -45.2% over the past year against the Zacks Internet - Commerce industry’s decline of -48.6% and the -17.1% decline in the S&amp;P 500 index. Weighing on Amazon's near-term outlook is the view that the company's strong growth during Covid resulted from pulled forward revenues from future periods that need to be accounted for over the next few quarters. The company is also believed to have over-hired during the pandemic, as a result of which its cost base has signficantly increased. These near-term headwinds aside, it is gaining on solid Prime momentum owing to ultrafast delivery services and strong content portfolio. Strengthening relationship with third-party sellers is another positive. Also, growing momentum across Amazon Music is contributing well. Additionally, strong adoption rate of AWS is aiding the company’s cloud dominance. Expanding AWS services portfolio is continuously helping Amazon in gaining further momentum among the customers.Further, robust Alexa skills and expanding smart home products portfolio are positives. Additionally, the company’s strong global presence and solid momentum among the small and medium businesses remain tailwinds. Considering the abovementioned facts, the Zacks analyst expect 2022 revenue to be up 11% from 2021.(You can read the full research report on Amazon.com here &gt;&gt;&gt;)Sanofi’s shares have underperformed the Zacks Large Cap Pharmaceuticals industry over the past year (-12.7% vs. +10.7%). The company is facing headwinds include weak performance of diabetes drugs and generic competition for many drugs. However, Sanofi’s Specialty Care unit is on a strong footing, particularly with the regular label expansion of Dupixent.Dupixent has become the key top-line driver for Sanofi. With outside U.S. revenues accelerating and multiple approvals for new indications expected in the near future, its sales are expected to be higher. Sanofi possesses a leading vaccine portfolio, which has become the primary top-line driver. Its R&amp;D pipeline is strong.Several data read-outs are expected in 2022. Sanofi’s Consumer unit is delivering above market sales growth. Sanofi has also launched several new drugs in the past couple of years and is expanding its pipeline through M&amp;A deals.(You can read the full research report on Sanofi here &gt;&gt;&gt;)Target’s shares have declined -24.7% this year vs. Walmart's -1.5% drop and the S&amp;P 500 index's -18.2% drop. The market has been unwilling to give Target credit for the inventory growth issue that came through in its April-quarter report in May. This is a relatively favorable set up for the stock should next week's quarterly report turns out to be better than what the market fears. Story continuesTarget has been deploying resources to enhance omni-channel capabilities, come up with new brands, refurbish stores and expand same-day delivery options to provide customers seamless shopping experience.Target has been making multiple changes to its business model to adapt and stay relevant in the dynamic retail landscape. These have been contributing to the top line. We believe that Target’s attempt to right-size inventory is the step in the right direction, as the demand skewed toward consumer staples and away from discretionary categories.However, this hurt margins as was visible in the second quarter of fiscal 2022 but better position the company to gain market share. The Zacks analyst expect top line to increase 3% and 4.2% in the third- and fourth-quarter, respectively. For the back half of the year, we expect operating margin to improve sequentially.(You can read the full research report on Target here &gt;&gt;&gt;)Other noteworthy reports we are featuring today include Humana Inc.

However, commodity cost-inflation is concerning for the company.Kimberly-Clark's (KMB) Cost-Cutting Aid Amid Rising InflationPer the Zacks analyst, Kimberly-Clark has been taking robust steps to lower costs amid inflationary pressure.

The Walmart sell-off was reinforced by an even more disappointing release from Target TGT the following day.Unlike the market’s indiscriminate negative reaction to Walmart and Target’s quarterly reports in May, it reacted favorably to Walmart’s July-quarter release on August 16th even though Target shares sold off on its quarterly report the following day.This recent history is useful to keep in mind as we look ahead to the October-quarter reports from Walmart and Target on Tuesday (11/15) and Wednesday (11/16), respectively.The chart below shows the year-to-date performance of Walmart (blue line) and Target (red line) shares relative to the S&amp;P 500 index (green line).Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchPart of the explanation for Walmart’s stock market stability is the nature of its business which offers a high degree of defense during periods of economic instability and uncertainty. Walmart also benefits from its perceived value proposition to customers that likely prompts segments of consumers to ‘trade down’ to its stores.The big issue in the last two quarterly releases for Walmart and Target centered on rising inventory levels, which reflected the combined effects of shifting consumer behavior and moderating sales. The market seems to believe, based on its treatment of the two stocks, that Walmart is further along in addressing its inventory issue than Target.We have no reason to disprove the market’s optimism about Walmart on the inventory issue, but we can nevertheless see the stock as vulnerable to any signs of weakness in this week’s quarterly report. On the flip side, Target shares appear ‘spring loaded’ for a bounce if the company’s release Wednesday morning turns out to be ‘less bad’ than the market fears.With respect to the Retail sector 2022 Q3 earnings season scorecard, we now have results from 21 of the 34 retailers in the S&amp;P 500 index. The Retail sector companies that have reported already are digital vendors like Amazon or restaurant operators like McDonald’s.Story continuesUnlike the official S&amp;P sector classifications that leaves retail sector players spread around different sectors, primarily Consumer Discretionary, Zacks’ stand-alone Retail sector classification that houses conventional retailers, digital players and restaurants allows for a more granular understanding of trends in the space.Total Q3 earnings for these retailers are down -5.8% from the same period last year on +10.4% higher revenues, with 71.4% beating EPS estimates and 52.4% beating revenue estimates.The comparison charts below put the Q3 beats percentages for these retailers in a historical context.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchAs you can see above, retailers have been struggling to come out with positive surprises thus far, with the trend particularly notable on the revenues side.With respect to the earnings and revenue growth rates, Amazon’s weak numbers play a significant role in the year-over-year growth rate for the sector (Amazon is part of the Zacks Retail sector, and not the Zacks Technology sector).The two comparison charts below show the Q3 earnings and revenue growth relative to other recent periods, both with Amazon’s results (left side chart) and without Amazon’s numbers (right side chart).Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchThis Week’s Reporting DocketWe have more than 350 companies on deck to report results this week, including 15 S&amp;P 500 members. Notable companies reporting this week, aside from a host of traditional retailers, include Nvidia NVDA, Cisco Systems CSCO, Applied Materials AMAT and others.Q3 Earnings Season Scorecard Including all of the results that came out through Friday, November 11th, we now have Q3 results from 461 S&amp;P 500 members that combined account for 92.2% of the index’s total membership.For the 461 index members that have reported results already, total earnings are up +2.6% from the same period last year on +12.4% higher revenues, with 69.4% beating EPS estimates and 67.9% beating revenue estimates.Here is how the 2022 Q3 earnings and revenue growth rates for these companies compare across different periods.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchHere is how the 2022 Q3 EPS and revenue beats percentages for these companies compare across different periods.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchThe EPS and revenue beats percentages are below what we had seen from this same group of companies in recent quarters, but otherwise within the historical range by now.Tracking Earnings Estimate RevisionsThe chart below that shows the blended earnings and revenue growth for 2022 Q3 relative to what we saw in the preceding four quarters and what is expected in the coming three periods.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchThis is no surprise, as the global economy is going through a synchronized slowdown, under the combined effects of rising interest rates in response to inflationary pressures, still-lingering logistical challenges that have started to ease up and China’s continuing zero-Covid restrictions.The orange bars in the chart above represent revenue growth. So, for 2022 Q3, revenues are on track to grow +11.4% from the same period last year even though earnings are only expected to be up +1.5%. This seemingly elevated revenue growth is a direct function of pricing power, with companies able to pass on rising input costs to end consumers. We intuitively know that this can’t go on forever and current projections for the next three quarters bears out this intuition.The above chart shows that earnings in the current period (2022 Q4) are expected to be -4.2% below the year-earlier level on +4.9% higher revenues. Estimates have been steadily coming down, in line with the trend that we saw ahead of the start of the Q3 earnings season.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchEstimates for full-year 2023 have been coming down as well, with the negative revisions trend particularly notable on an ex-Energy basis. You can see this in the chart below that shows the aggregate 2023 earnings estimate on an ex-Energy basis.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchSince mid-April, 2023 earnings estimates in the aggregate have come down by -8.1% for the S&amp;P 500 index as a whole and -10.9% on an ex-Energy basis. The cuts to estimates have been particularly notable for the Tech (down -18.2% since mid-April), Construction (-22.3%), Retail (-18.4%), Industrial Products (-11.9%), Consumer Discretionary (-18.1%) and Aerospace (-12.0%).The chart below shows the overall earnings picture on an annual basis.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchThere are some in the market who think that 2023 earnings should be below the 2022 level instead of the current expected +3.5% growth simply because the U.S. economy is expected to go through a moderate recession.I am not suggesting that 2023 earnings can’t be below the 2022 level; they can be and on current revisions trend are likely headed there. But it is wrong to expect moderate declines in ‘real’ GDP to automatically result in ‘nominal’ or non-inflation adjusted corporate earnings to also decline. Corporate revenues and earnings are ‘nominal’ values and will reflect the effects of inflation. Inflation is expected to come down in 2023, but nevertheless remain positive.For a detailed look at the overall earnings picture, including expectations for the coming periods, please check out our weekly Earnings Trends report &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Making Sense of the Earnings Picture and Estimate Revisions   Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Today's Research Daily features new research reports on 16 major stocks, including Amazon.com, Inc. (AMZN), Sanofi (SNY) and Target Corporation (TGT). These research reports have been hand-picked from the roughly 70 reports published by our analyst team today.You can see all of today’s research reports here &gt;&gt;&gt;Shares of Amazon.com have declined -45.2% over the past year against the Zacks Internet - Commerce industry’s decline of -48.6% and the -17.1% decline in the S&amp;P 500 index. Weighing on Amazon's near-term outlook is the view that the company's strong growth during Covid resulted from pulled forward revenues from future periods that need to be accounted for over the next few quarters. The company is also believed to have over-hired during the pandemic, as a result of which its cost base has signficantly increased. These near-term headwinds aside, it is gaining on solid Prime momentum owing to ultrafast delivery services and strong content portfolio. Strengthening relationship with third-party sellers is another positive. Also, growing momentum across Amazon Music is contributing well. Additionally, strong adoption rate of AWS is aiding the company’s cloud dominance. Expanding AWS services portfolio is continuously helping Amazon in gaining further momentum among the customers.Further, robust Alexa skills and expanding smart home products portfolio are positives. Additionally, the company’s strong global presence and solid momentum among the small and medium businesses remain tailwinds. Considering the abovementioned facts, the Zacks analyst expect 2022 revenue to be up 11% from 2021.(You can read the full research report on Amazon.com here &gt;&gt;&gt;)Sanofi’s shares have underperformed the Zacks Large Cap Pharmaceuticals industry over the past year (-12.7% vs. +10.7%). The company is facing headwinds include weak performance of diabetes drugs and generic competition for many drugs. However, Sanofi’s Specialty Care unit is on a strong footing, particularly with the regular label expansion of Dupixent.Dupixent has become the key top-line driver for Sanofi. With outside U.S. revenues accelerating and multiple approvals for new indications expected in the near future, its sales are expected to be higher. Sanofi possesses a leading vaccine portfolio, which has become the primary top-line driver. Its R&amp;D pipeline is strong.Several data read-outs are expected in 2022. Sanofi’s Consumer unit is delivering above market sales growth. Sanofi has also launched several new drugs in the past couple of years and is expanding its pipeline through M&amp;A deals.(You can read the full research report on Sanofi here &gt;&gt;&gt;)Target’s shares have declined -24.7% this year vs. Walmart's -1.5% drop and the S&amp;P 500 index's -18.2% drop. The market has been unwilling to give Target credit for the inventory growth issue that came through in its April-quarter report in May. This is a relatively favorable set up for the stock should next week's quarterly report turns out to be better than what the market fears. Story continuesTarget has been deploying resources to enhance omni-channel capabilities, come up with new brands, refurbish stores and expand same-day delivery options to provide customers seamless shopping experience.Target has been making multiple changes to its business model to adapt and stay relevant in the dynamic retail landscape. These have been contributing to the top line. We believe that Target’s attempt to right-size inventory is the step in the right direction, as the demand skewed toward consumer staples and away from discretionary categories.However, this hurt margins as was visible in the second quarter of fiscal 2022 but better position the company to gain market share. The Zacks analyst expect top line to increase 3% and 4.2% in the third- and fourth-quarter, respectively. For the back half of the year, we expect operating margin to improve sequentially.(You can read the full research report on Target here &gt;&gt;&gt;)Other noteworthy reports we are featuring today include Humana Inc.

ISRG is well-poised for growth on the increasing adoption of the da Vinci Surgical System and a strong international presence. Although the company faces inflationary headwinds, its improved margins in the third quarter and lower-than-previously expected operating expenses growth boost sentiment.Shares of this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company have lost 28.6% compared with the industry’s decline of 34.7% this year.

The app enables surgeons to manage their da Vinci experience, log into da Vinci systems, manage their training and view their operative data from the palm of their hand.Story continuesIntuitive Surgical’s Ion system is also experiencing strong uptake as the installed base increased to approximately 254 systems in the third quarter, compared with the installed base of approximately 98 systems in the year-ago period. The system expands the company’s service beyond surgery into diagnostic procedures.Intuitive Surgical’s teams in Israel and the United States have developed Intuitive Hub on the back of its Orpheus technology. Intuitive Hub — unified hardware and software solution for the operating room — allows OR teams to capture, edit and share video clips from clinical procedures and partner virtually by utilizing existing workflows and intuitive systems. The Intuitive Hub grew 21% from the third quarter of last year and software updates to the Hub installed base improved usability and enabled telepresence.The FDA clearance earlier this year for integrating mobile cone-beam CT (CBCT) imaging technology with its minimally-invasive, robotic-assisted bronchoscopy system, Ion Endoluminal System, is likely to benefit the company. The technology would allow the biopsy of small and difficult-to-access lesions in the lung as well as the biopsy of the peripheral lung and provide the necessary stability for precision in a biopsy.Intuitive Surgical, Inc. PriceIntuitive Surgical, Inc. PriceIntuitive Surgical, Inc. price | Intuitive Surgical, Inc. QuoteIn the third quarter of 2022, outside the United States, revenues totaled $474.4 million, up 5.2% on a year-over-year basis. This was driven by substantial growth in procedure volume. Outside the United States, Intuitive Surgical placed 130 systems in the third quarter compared with 109 in the prior-year quarter. Of these, 54 were in Europe, 32 in Japan and 17 in China.Meanwhile, Intuitive Surgical’s gross margin and adjusted operating margin improved year over year during the third quarter. The expansion in both gross and operating margins buoys optimism. The company now expects its pro-forma operating expense to grow 21%-23%, lower than the previous guidance of 23%-25%. The company also expects operating expense to decline in 2023. Decline in the expense guidance amid macro headwinds like inflation buoy optimism for the stock.However, the intense competition in the global MedTech space remains a concern.What’s Weighing on the Company?The COVID-19 pandemic adversely impacted the global supply of semiconductors and other materials utilized in Intuitive Surgical’s products. Although the company has been making every effort to secure the supply required to fulfill consumer demand, global shortages might result in higher output costs or delay in production.Estimates TrendThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2022 revenues is pegged at $6.25 billion, suggesting growth of 9.5% from the year-ago reported number, while the same for earnings stands at $4.68 per share, indicating a decline of 5.7%.

Price and EPS SurpriseSonos, Inc. Price and EPS SurpriseSonos, Inc. price-eps-surprise | Sonos, Inc. QuoteFactors at PlaySofter consumer demand owing to the weakness prevailing over global macroeconomic conditions and rising inflation are likely to have affected Sonos’ fourth-quarter performance. Unfavorable forex movement and lingering supply chain issues resulting in increased component costs are likely to have been other headwinds.Shifting consumer spending patterns has been compelling retail partners to right-size their inventory positions, which is likely to have negatively impacted Sonos’ performance.In the last reported quarter, the company slashed its 2022 outlook owing to the abovementioned factors. Sonos now expects revenues to increase 1-2% year over year in the range of $1.73-$1.755 billion. Earlier the company expected revenues to increase 14-16% year over year in the range of $1.95-$2 billion.Nonetheless, higher selling price is expected to have provided some cushioning to the fiscal fourth quarter performance. The company has been focused on its three strategic initiatives — expanding its brand, boosting its offerings and driving operational excellence.New product launches are likely to act as a tailwind. In September, Sonos announced the launch of its new speaker, Sub Mini, to further expand its home theater product line. The speaker is priced at $429. The Sub Mini features an acoustically sealed cabinet with woofers facing inward that creates a force-canceling effect, which reduces distortion and provides its users with an immersive audio experience. It can also be paired with the company’s existing line of home theater products like Beam or Ray.Steady traction witnessed for products such as Beam Gen 2, Roam, Ray, Arc, as well as partnerships with companies like Audi and IKEA is likely to have aided the company in the quarter under review.Story continuesEarnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively predict an earnings beat for Sonos this time around.

ROST is scheduled to release third-quarter fiscal 2022 results on Nov 17. The off-price retailer of apparel and home accessories is likely to have witnessed revenue and earnings declines in the to-be-reported quarter.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for fiscal third-quarter revenues is pegged at $4.36 billion, indicating a decline of 4.7% from the figure reported in the year-ago quarter. For fiscal third-quarter earnings, the consensus mark of 80 cents per share suggests a decline of 26.6% from the year-ago quarter's reported number. The consensus mark for earnings has moved down by a penny in the past 30 days.In the last reported quarter, Ross Stores delivered an earnings surprise of 13.3%. It has delivered an earnings beat of 14.1%, on average, in the trailing four quarters.Ross Stores, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise Ross Stores, Inc. Price and EPS SurpriseRoss Stores, Inc. price-eps-surprise | Ross Stores, Inc. QuoteKey Factors to NoteRoss Stores has been witnessing robust customer demand, aiding the top line. Sales in the fiscal third quarter are likely to have benefited from broad-based growth across merchandise categories and regions, as well as robust comparable store sales. Sales are also expected to have gained from robust trends at the dd's DISCOUNTS business. Gains at the core business, driven by consumers' continued focus on value and the company’s ability to deliver value bargains to customers, bode well.On its last reported quarter’s earnings call, Ross Stores stated that the ongoing strength in consumer demand would likely continue despite the uncertainty regarding supply-chain woes.Ross Stores has been consistent with the execution of its store expansion plans, which are likely to have aided the top line. The company's store-expansion efforts have been focused on continually increasing penetration in existing and new markets. The third-quarter fiscal 2022 performance is anticipated to have gained from the company’s return to normal store opening targets. Gains from new stores are expected to get reflected in the company's sales for the fiscal third quarter.However, Ross Stores has been witnessing the effects of the ongoing industry-wide supply-chain challenges, leading to higher freight costs and distribution expenses. This is likely to have partly impacted the company’s cost of goods sold rate in the fiscal third quarter. Higher domestic freight expenses and distribution costs mainly on the ongoing supply-chain headwinds and higher wages are likely to have weighed on earnings in the to-be-reported quarter.On the last reported quarter's earnings call, Ross Stores anticipated continued impacts from the industry-wide supply-chain dynamics and other risks from inflation, as well as costs within its business, to hurt the fiscal third-quarter performance. Ross Stores provided a conservative view for the rest of fiscal 2022.Ross Stores anticipates comps to be down 7-9% for third-quarter fiscal 2022, whereas it reported 14% growth in third-quarter fiscal 2021. Earnings per share are envisioned to be 72-83 cents, whereas it reported $1.09 in third-quarter fiscal 2021.For third-quarter fiscal 2022, the company expects the operating margin to be 7.8-8.7%, down from 11.4% reported in the prior-year quarter. The operating margin is expected to be affected by the negative comp forecast, lower merchandise margin stemming from ocean freight costs and sluggish sales view, and increased markdowns. Also, the unfavorable timing of packaway-related costs is likely to hurt the operating margin.Story continuesZacks ModelOur proven model conclusively predicts an earnings beat for Ross Stores this time around.

In addition, Zacks Equity Research provides analysis on Tencent Music Entertainment Group TME, Ross Stores Inc. ROST and StoneCo Ltd. STNE.Here is a synopsis of all five stocks.Bull of the Day:The market is in all out beast mode right now. The lower than expected CPI number this month helped spark a rally of epic proportions. A big gap up and go for stocks that many expect is likely to continue. That may make everyone feel like the dart-board approach is back. That could not be further from the truth. When the frothy rally dies, it will be earnings that separate the platinum from the white gold.One way to find stocks with great earnings trends is by leaning on our Zacks Rank. Our Zacks Rank is based on earnings estimate revisions coming from analysts all over Wall Street. Today’s Bull of the Day is Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) Douglas Dynamics.Douglas Dynamics, Inc. operates as a manufacturer and upfitter of commercial work truck attachments and equipment in North America. It operates through two segments, Work Truck Attachments and Work Truck Solutions.  The company sells its products under the BLIZZARD, FISHER, SNOWEX, WESTERN, TURFEX, SWEEPEX, HENDERSON, BRINEXTREME, and DEJANA brands. It distributes its products primarily to professional snowplowers who are contracted to remove snow and ice from commercial and residential areas. The company was founded in 1948 and is headquartered in Milwaukee, Wisconsin.The reason for the favorable Zacks Rank is that analysts have been increasing their earnings estimates for both the current year and next year. Over the last 30 days, estimates for the current year are up from $1.80 to $2.01 while next year’s number is up from $2.27 to $2.32. That represents EPS growth of 20% this year and 15% next year.Story continuesThe year-over-year growth has helped the stock rally from lows under $30 in October to over $38 today. The stock is still a far cry from the late 2019, early 2020 highs over $55.Bear of the Day:The latest move higher in the market has boosted up all kinds of stocks. That means, even stocks with weak earnings trend have rebounded because they were simply so oversold. Be careful when you come in and buy the dip blindly. Sometimes, the stocks that are going up along with the rest of the market are not the quality names that you should be betting on.One way to avoid stocks with weak earnings trends is passing on Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) stocks. These stocks have seen earnings estimates drop over the last few weeks, which means that Wall Street could be turning bearish. Today’s Bear of the Day is one such stock. I’m talking about Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) Fresenius Medical. Fresenius Medical Care AG &amp; Co. KGaA provides dialysis care and related dialysis care services in Germany, North America, and internationally. It offers dialysis treatment and related laboratory and diagnostic services through a network of outpatient dialysis clinics; materials, training, and patient support services comprising clinical monitoring, follow-up assistance, and arranging for delivery of the supplies to the patient's residence; and dialysis services under contract to hospitals in the United States for the hospitalized end-stage renal disease (ESRD) patients and for patients suffering from acute kidney failure.The reason for the unfavorable rank is that over the last 60 days, three analysts have cut estimates for the current year and next year. The negative moves have cut our Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year from $1.67 to $1.46 while next year’s number is off from $1.86 to $1.56. That’s a 29% contraction this year and growth of just 6.7% next year.The Medical-Instruments Peers industry ranks in the Bottom 48% of our Zacks Industry Rank.Additional content:4 Stocks to Buy Ahead of Earnings Next WeekWe are in the last leg of the third-quarter 2022 earnings season.

Investors can't control the latter, but they can focus on a company's earnings results every quarter.Life and the stock market are both about expectations, and rising above what is expected is often rewarded, while falling short can come with negative consequences. Investors might want to try to capture stronger returns by finding positive earnings surprises.2 Stocks to Add to Your WatchlistThe Zacks Earnings ESP is more formally known as the Expected Surprise Prediction, and it aims to grab the inside track on the latest analyst estimate revisions ahead of a company's report. The idea is relatively intuitive as a newer projection might be based on more complete information. The ESP is calculated by comparing the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate, with the percentage difference between the two giving us the Zacks ESP figure.The last thing we will do today, now that we have a grasp on the ESP and how powerful of a tool it can be, is to look at a qualifying stock. Analog Devices (ADI) holds a Zacks Rank #3 at the moment and its Most Accurate Estimate comes in at $2.61 a share 11 days away from its upcoming earnings release on November 22, 2022.By taking the percentage difference between the $2.61 Most Accurate Estimate and the $2.58 Zacks Consensus Estimate, Analog Devices has an Earnings ESP of 1.1%.ADI is just one of a large group of Computer and Technology stocks with a positive ESP figure. Fortinet (FTNT) is another qualifying stock you may want to consider.Slated to report earnings on February 2, 2023, Fortinet holds a #2 (Buy) ranking on the Zacks Rank, and it's Most Accurate Estimate is $0.39 a share 83 days from its next quarterly update.Fortinet's Earnings ESP figure currently stands at 0.88% after taking the percentage difference between its Most Accurate Estimate and its Zacks Consensus Estimate of $0.39.Story continuesADI and FTNT's positive ESP metrics may signal that a positive earnings surprise for both stocks is on the horizon.Find Stocks to Buy or Sell Before They're ReportedUse the Zacks Earnings ESP Filter to turn up stocks with the highest probability of positively, or negatively, surprising to buy or sell before they're reported for profitable earnings season trading.

But for Regions Bank's Chris Parker, it's akin to a family reunion. And for good reason.Parker, who is a Consumer Lending analyst in the Finance department at Regions, is happy to share with all of Birmingham, Alabama, the honor that his great-grandfather, Raymond Weeks, brought to the bank's headquarters city in 1954.Weeks, a Birmingham native, served in the U.S. Navy during World War II. When he returned, he realized there was no holiday to honor those who fought in the war. Armistice Day was founded in 1919 to celebrate the end of World War I, and Memorial Day commemorates those that fought and died while serving in the armed forces.Weeks led a delegation to Washington D.C. in 1947 to establish a holiday that would be a tribute to all veterans. President Dwight Eisenhower signed legislation in 1954 creating the Veterans Day holiday.Three generations later, Parker and his family actively participate in the Birmingham Veterans Day activities - including leading the parade, just a block away from Parker's office at Regions Center.Through community involvement, military friendly products and services, and efforts to employ and develop veterans, military members and their spouses, we are committed to making life better for those who serve and their families.Steve Beres, Service Members and Veterans Affairs manager for Regions""Birmingham has had its highs and lows, but this is something we can all be proud of,"" said Parker about his hometown hosting the oldest Veterans Day parade in the country.Regions Bank has been a corporate sponsor of the Birmingham parade for more than a decade and Regions celebrates Veterans Day with many bank-wide programs and recognitions. But according to Steve Beres, Service Members and Veterans Affairs manager for Regions, the support for military members, veterans and their families is priority every day of the year.Story continues""Through community involvement, military-friendly products and services, and efforts to employ and develop veterans, military members and their spouses, we are committed to making life better for those who serve and their families,"" Beres said.""Having a Regions associate with family ties to the Veterans Day holiday makes our efforts even more meaningful,"" he added.The connection is a real point of pride for Parker. ""My great-grandfather died before I was born, so unfortunately I never knew him,"" he said. ""But I'm so proud that my parents, brother, cousins, aunts and uncles still get together each year on Nov. 11 to honor him and all the veterans who have served our country.""Raymond Weeks has been recognized as a true national hero. In 1982, President Ronald Reagan presented him with the Presidential Citizens Medal.""My great-grandfather was passionate about ensuring Americans never forget about the loyalty and dedication of our veterans and it's important that succeeding generations continue to pay tribute to those brave men and women,"" Parker said.Parker said that plans are in the works to develop school programs to educate young people in Birmingham about the city's key role in the holiday - which is a real ""feather in its cap"" according to Parker.""My wife Betsy and I just got married last year, and I look forward to continuing the family tradition of marching in the parade and attending the other Veterans Day activities in Birmingham each year,"" Parker said. ""It's part of my DNA and really all of Birmingham's DNA!""View additional multimedia and more ESG storytelling from Regions Bank on 3blmedia.com.Contact Info:Spokesperson: Regions BankWebsite: profiles/regions-bankEmail: info@3blmedia.comSOURCE: Regions BankView source version on accesswire.com: https://www.accesswire.com/725224/Veterans-Day-A-Family-Affair]"
161,8939df42-6fd6-32f9-8735-1ae72896d067,APH,2022-11-12,Amphenol (NYSE:APH) Has Announced That It Will Be Increasing Its Dividend To $0.21,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/amphenol-nyse-aph-announced-increasing-122545770.html,1668255945,STORY,['APH'],"[The board of Amphenol Corporation (NYSE:APH) has announced that it will be paying its dividend of $0.21 on the 11th of January, an increased payment from last year's comparable dividend. This takes the annual payment to 1.1% of the current stock price, which unfortunately is below what the industry is paying. Check out our latest analysis for Amphenol Amphenol's Dividend Is Well Covered By EarningsThe dividend yield is a little bit low, but sustainability of the payments is also an important part of evaluating an income stock. Before making this announcement, Amphenol was easily earning enough to cover the dividend. This means that most of its earnings are being retained to grow the business.Looking forward, earnings per share is forecast to rise by 14.8% over the next year. If the dividend continues on this path, the payout ratio could be 26% by next year, which we think can be pretty sustainable going forward.historic-dividendAmphenol Has A Solid Track RecordThe company has been paying a dividend for a long time, and it has been quite stable which gives us confidence in the future dividend potential. Since 2012, the annual payment back then was $0.105, compared to the most recent full-year payment of $0.84. This means that it has been growing its distributions at 23% per annum over that time. We can see that payments have shown some very nice upward momentum without faltering, which provides some reassurance that future payments will also be reliable.The Dividend Looks Likely To GrowInvestors could be attracted to the stock based on the quality of its payment history. We are encouraged to see that Amphenol has grown earnings per share at 14% per year over the past five years. A low payout ratio and decent growth suggests that the company is reinvesting well, and it also has plenty of room to increase the dividend over time.Amphenol Looks Like A Great Dividend StockOverall, we think this could be an attractive income stock, and it is only getting better by paying a higher dividend this year. Distributions are quite easily covered by earnings, which are also being converted to cash flows. Taking this all into consideration, this looks like it could be a good dividend opportunity.Story continuesCompanies possessing a stable dividend policy will likely enjoy greater investor interest than those suffering from a more inconsistent approach. Still, investors need to consider a host of other factors, apart from dividend payments, when analysing a company. For instance, we've picked out 1 warning sign for Amphenol that investors should take into consideration. Looking for more high-yielding dividend ideas?

TPR need to pay close attention to the stock based on moves in the options market lately. That is because the Jan 20, 2023 $15.00 Call had some of the highest implied volatility of all equity options today.What is Implied Volatility?Implied volatility shows how much movement the market is expecting in the future. Options with high levels of implied volatility suggest that investors in the underlying stocks are expecting a big move in one direction or the other. It could also mean there is an event coming up soon that may cause a big rally or a huge sell-off. However, implied volatility is only one piece of the puzzle when putting together an options trading strategy.What do the Analysts Think?Clearly, options traders are pricing in a big move for Tapestry shares, but what is the fundamental picture for the company? Currently, Tapestry is a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) in the Retail - Apparel and Shoes industry that ranks in the Bottom 35% of our Zacks Industry Rank. Over the last 60 days, no analysts have increased their earnings estimates for the current quarter, while one analyst has revised the estimate downward. The net effect has taken our Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current quarter from 75 cents per share to 74 cents in that period.Given the way analysts feel about Tapestry right now, this huge implied volatility could mean there’s a trade developing. Oftentimes, options traders look for options with high levels of implied volatility to sell premium. This is a strategy many seasoned traders use because it captures decay. At expiration, the hope for these traders is that the underlying stock does not move as much as originally expected.Looking to Trade Options?Check out the simple yet high-powered approach that Zacks Executive VP Kevin Matras has used to close recent double and triple-digit winners.

This is over the trailing five days, so everything that happened in this very packed week. One of the standouts, we're seeing a lot of dark green on this board. But Tesla, that is down 5 and 1/2%. Of course, Twitter, that $44 billion purchase, that cost money. But you can see Tesla down about 44% year to date, just off of those lows, as are a number of other stocks here.Also taking a look at some of the leaders, Nvidia, one of the chip stocks, and we're going to switch over to that board here. Nvidia up about 15%. Taiwan Semi, you can see that's up 18%. They reported earnings this week, and in fact, they are a supplier of a number of companies, including Nvidia, and AMD. They use their services for foundries. Anyway, the bottom line is, outlook is pretty good for them. We're going to get a lot more earnings in the chip space in the weeks to come.But now I want to focus on Ark. Now we already took a look at Tesla. Look at some of these other components here. A lot of these got participation in the junk off of the bottom rally. I don't mean to [INAUDIBLE] on all of these as junk. I'm just talking about the stock performance. But Shopify, up 22%. Looks like Block up 19%, Unity up 28%. A lot of investors would take these gains if not for the fact that some of these stocks very, very much still underwater. You can see 60% to 80% down.But I'm going to put this down on a five-day basis, and let's take a look at China, because as we were speaking with one of the guests earlier today, I think it's one of the under-reported stories of the day, just because it got overshadowed by everything else. But China even rolling back its zero tolerance COVID policy just a little bit, has given these stocks quite a flying number high here.Story continuesJD.com up 10% over the trailing five days. Pinduoduo is actually positive for the year. Not many Chinese stocks, in fact, not many growth stocks can say that. But Pinduoduo there getting it done. And let's take a look at the travel space as well. And we only see one standout in red. That would be Avis Budget Group. That stock is also positive year to date, but well off of its highs.Some other movers in the space, I was looking at Carnival Cruise lines. That's up 15%. A lot of these charts are going to look the same. Almost doesn't matter what industry. Yes, it's down 48%, but trying to base here off of these recent lows.Going to close out with a look at the indices, because it was the NASDAQ that was a big winner this week, up 8%, followed by the Hang Seng over in China, followed by the S&amp;P 500. We got the Germans, they produced. The DAX had 5 and 1/2%, and then we go to the KOSPI over in Korea. Russell 2000 and Dow Jones Industrial index. That's up 4%, but I think investors are going to take these gains. They're going to book them for the week, and we're going to come back Monday and do it all over again, Rochelle]"

If you want to see more stocks in this selection, check out 5 Best American Stocks To Buy Heading Into 2023. As per Bank of America, a new bull market could emerge in 2023 after the Federal Reserve aggressively hiked interest rates in 2022 in a bid to control inflation. While most investors are focused on the Fed's continuous rate hikes, they fail to observe that the central bank is shrinking its $9 trillion balance sheet by means of monthly roll-offs of its treasury and mortgage debt worth $95 billion. Paired with rising rates, this move will make the global market illiquid, which can trigger a reversal in the Fed’s policy making next year. BofA's investment strategist Michael Hartnett said that central banks are ""petrified of market consequences of liquidity withdrawal.” The US dollar climbing new highs is another signal that the Fed could potentially press pause on its fiscal tightening. Any shift from the Fed, whether it chooses to halt future interest rate hikes or continues its monthly balance sheet reductions, could be a positive indicator for investors and result in a significant rally. However, Hartnett observed that the market will experience more pain before a relief rally in 2023, and he expects that stocks will touch record lows soon. As stocks hurtle towards new lows, investors are taking this opportunity to pile into high-quality firms which would normally be trading at much higher multiples. Case in point, Hartnett observed on October 21 that equities experienced in flows of more than $9 billion in the past week.

Lilly also has a drug in development for Alzheimer’s disease in the same class as Lecanemab, a drug being developed by Biogen and Eisai that slowed the rate of cognitive decline in a late-stage clinical trial.

It is one of the best American stocks to buy heading into 2023. On October 19, Bank of America Corporation (NYSE:BAC) declared a quarterly dividend of $0.22 per share, in line with previous. The dividend is payable on December 30, to shareholders of record on December 2. Bank of America Corporation (NYSE:BAC)’s dividend yield on November 11 came in at 2.31%. JPMorgan analyst Vivek Juneja raised the price target on Bank of America Corporation (NYSE:BAC) to $39 from $35.50 and reiterated an Overweight rating on the shares.

Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway is the largest position holder in the company, with more than 1 billion shares worth $31.4 billion. Like Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), Mastercard Incorporated (NYSE:MA), and JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. (NYSE:JPM), Bank of America Corporation (NYSE:BAC) is one of the premier stocks to pick up for next year. Here is what Artisan Partners specifically said about Bank of America Corporation (NYSE:BAC) in its Q2 2022 investor letter:“We made only one new purchase during the quarter, initiating a position in Bank of America (BAC). As one of America’s largest banks, Bank of America Corporation (NYSE:BAC) is second only to JPMorgan Chase (JPM) in size and is probably its closest peer. Both are well-run banks, but compared to JPM, since the GFC, BAC has retired more shares, grown EPS faster and currently has more capital and a lower dividend payout. We are attracted to BAC’s strong capital base, high capital generation capacity, large loan loss reserve, low (~50%) loan/deposit ratio, short duration investment securities book, and low dividend payout that provides financial flexibility. BAC has a less volatile earnings stream than JPM with lower capital market sensitive exposures. Additionally, BAC is rigorously stress tested by the Fed every year in quantitative and qualitative fashion. Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway, which we hold in the portfolio, owns 12% of BAC. He petitioned the Fed to own more than 10%, so he clearly likes it. Bank stocks were strong gainers in 2021 on the prospects of higher rates boosting net interest margins, but the stocks pulled back in the first half of 2022 on economic concerns. We believe BAC has massive scale advantages, should benefit from increasing interest rates, particularly in the 2-year part of the yield curve, and should grow over time with the economy. The economic environment is highly uncertain, but current consensus includes the provision for losses more than doubling and capital markets activity slowing. Against that backdrop, our purchase price equated to about 8.5X our estimates of “mid-cycle” earnings. With leading businesses, a double-digit ROE, a prudent capital return strategy and a strong balance sheet, we believe this entry point offers a solid long-term value.” Click to continue reading and see 5 Best American Stocks To Buy Heading Into 2023.  Suggested articles:10 Stocks That Will Make You RichGoldman Sachs Semiconductor StocksBest Warren Buffett Stocks To Buy Disclosure: None. 13 Best American Stocks To Buy Heading Into 2023 is originally published on Insider Monkey.]"

ISRG is well-poised for growth on the increasing adoption of the da Vinci Surgical System and a strong international presence. Although the company faces inflationary headwinds, its improved margins in the third quarter and lower-than-previously expected operating expenses growth boost sentiment.Shares of this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company have lost 28.6% compared with the industry’s decline of 34.7% this year. The S&amp;P 500 Index has declined 22.6% in the same time frame.ISRG — with a market capitalization of $83.44 billion — designs, manufactures and markets the da Vinci surgical system and related instruments and accessories. The da Vinci surgical system is an advanced robot-assisted surgical system. The company anticipates earnings to improve 12% over the next five years. It beat earnings estimates in three of the trailing four quarters and missed once, the average surprise being 3.41%.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchWhat’s Favoring the Stock?Intuitive Surgical’s robot-based da Vinci surgical system enables minimally-invasive surgery that reduces risks associated with open surgery. The company continues to gain from this system, which, in turn, bolsters overall performance.The company shipped 305 da Vinci Surgical Systems in the quarter, taking the total installed base to 7,364 da Vinci surgical systems by the end of the third quarter of 2022, reflecting growth of 12.9% year over year. For 2022, the company projects procedure growth of 17-18%.With respect to digital capabilities, the company remains focused on improving the ecosystem. On the third-quarter 2022 earnings call, the company stated that the My Intuitive app community continued to increase on a year-over-year basis. The app is currently available in several countries, including the United States, Japan, Germany, France, the U.K. and Ireland, and Switzerland, with more launches set the upcoming quarters. The app enables surgeons to manage their da Vinci experience, log into da Vinci systems, manage their training and view their operative data from the palm of their hand.Story continuesIntuitive Surgical’s Ion system is also experiencing strong uptake as the installed base increased to approximately 254 systems in the third quarter, compared with the installed base of approximately 98 systems in the year-ago period. The system expands the company’s service beyond surgery into diagnostic procedures.Intuitive Surgical’s teams in Israel and the United States have developed Intuitive Hub on the back of its Orpheus technology. Intuitive Hub — unified hardware and software solution for the operating room — allows OR teams to capture, edit and share video clips from clinical procedures and partner virtually by utilizing existing workflows and intuitive systems. The Intuitive Hub grew 21% from the third quarter of last year and software updates to the Hub installed base improved usability and enabled telepresence.The FDA clearance earlier this year for integrating mobile cone-beam CT (CBCT) imaging technology with its minimally-invasive, robotic-assisted bronchoscopy system, Ion Endoluminal System, is likely to benefit the company. The technology would allow the biopsy of small and difficult-to-access lesions in the lung as well as the biopsy of the peripheral lung and provide the necessary stability for precision in a biopsy.Intuitive Surgical, Inc. PriceIntuitive Surgical, Inc. PriceIntuitive Surgical, Inc. price | Intuitive Surgical, Inc. QuoteIn the third quarter of 2022, outside the United States, revenues totaled $474.4 million, up 5.2% on a year-over-year basis. This was driven by substantial growth in procedure volume. Outside the United States, Intuitive Surgical placed 130 systems in the third quarter compared with 109 in the prior-year quarter. Of these, 54 were in Europe, 32 in Japan and 17 in China.Meanwhile, Intuitive Surgical’s gross margin and adjusted operating margin improved year over year during the third quarter. The expansion in both gross and operating margins buoys optimism. The company now expects its pro-forma operating expense to grow 21%-23%, lower than the previous guidance of 23%-25%. The company also expects operating expense to decline in 2023. Decline in the expense guidance amid macro headwinds like inflation buoy optimism for the stock.However, the intense competition in the global MedTech space remains a concern.What’s Weighing on the Company?The COVID-19 pandemic adversely impacted the global supply of semiconductors and other materials utilized in Intuitive Surgical’s products. Although the company has been making every effort to secure the supply required to fulfill consumer demand, global shortages might result in higher output costs or delay in production.Estimates TrendThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2022 revenues is pegged at $6.25 billion, suggesting growth of 9.5% from the year-ago reported number, while the same for earnings stands at $4.68 per share, indicating a decline of 5.7%.

178,7e37ce5f-61f3-332c-840d-bb8a512f9fab,MCK,2022-11-12,October CPI Data Raises Hope for a Soft Landing: 5 Top Picks,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/october-cpi-data-raises-hope-125912688.html,1668171552,STORY,"['MCK', 'HUM', 'CAT', 'MPC', 'COMP', '^GSPC', '^RUT', 'ORLY']","[Nov 10 ushered in a silver lining for Wall Street behind the dark clouds seen in 2022. The Bureau of Labor Statistics reported that the consumer price index (CPI) for October came lighter than market’s expectation, and U.S. stock markets shot up on the belief that the peak of inflation is behind us.October’s CPI data has significantly strengthened the ongoing Wall Street rally that started last month and paved the way for a year-end rally too. Historically, the last two months of any year have been favorable for investors. Moreover, the global financial market is abuzz  with a rumor that China may reopen from COVID-19 restrictions.Therefore, the stage has been set for a bull run unless any external shock like a geopolitical conflict creates a hurdle. To gain from this ongoing rally, we have selected five U.S. corporate giants with a favorable Zacks Rank and strong business potential for the rest of 2022. These are — Caterpillar Inc. CAT, McKesson Corp. MCK, Marathon Petroleum Corp. MPC, O'Reilly Automotive Inc. ORLY and Humana Inc. HUM.Inflation Seems to be DwindlingThe Department of Labor reported that CPI in October rose 0.4% month over month and 7.7% year over year. The consensus estimate was 0.5% for the month-over-month rise and 7.9% for the year-over-year gain. Core CPI (excluding volatile food and energy items) increased 0.3% month over month and 6.3% year over year. The consensus estimate was of a rise of 0.5% month over month and 6.5% year over year.The decline in CPI and core CPI may be marginal but peak inflation seems behind us. In fact, economic indicators like a tepid housing sector, declining commodity prices (except food and energy), growing accumulation of inventories on the part of manufacturers and retailers, gradual slowdown of the ISM manufacturing PMI and a decline in the job openings rate were pointing to the cooling down of the U.S. economy.Consequently, the three major stock indexes  — the Dow, the S&amp;P 500 and the Nasdaq Composite — rallied 3.7%, 5.5% and 7.4%, respectively, marking their best single-day performance in more than 30 months. The small-cap benchmark — the Russell 2000 — also surged 6.1%.Story continuesCan Fed Delivers a Soft Landing?After the release of the October CPI data, the CME FedWatch shows that there exists an 80.6% probability, against a 56.8% probability just a day ago that the Fed will raise the benchmark lending rate by 50 basis points in December.The ICE U.S. Dollar Index (DXY), which measures the greenback’s strength against a basket of six major currencies, fell 2.4% to 107.85 from 113 in Nov 3. The index soared to its 20-year high of 114.24 in Sep 27. Global financial markets were rattled by a skyrocketing dollar. The yield on the benchmark 10-Year U.S. Treasury Note dropped 33 basis points to 3.828%. The interest-rate-sensitive yield on the short-term 2-Year U.S. Treasury Note fell 30 basis points to 4.32%. Investors were highly concerned about an imminent recession due to the soaring risk-free market rate.Moreover, U.S. GDP has grown 2.6% in the third quarter, beating the consensus estimate of 2.2%. Market participants were worried that the economy might enter into a recession after it contracted in the first two quarters of this year.The labor market is currently at the pre-pandemic level with an unemployment rate of 3.7%. Finally, despite several major headwinds, the overall management guidance in the third-quarter 2022 earnings season was fairly good.Therefore, a strong U.S. economy and slowing inflation may enable the Fed to perform the herculean task of a soft landing of the economy.Our Top PicksWe have narrowed our search to five U.S. corporate behemoths with solid growth potential. These companies have seen positive earnings estimate revision in the last seven days indicating that the market is expecting them to do robust business in the near term.

MPC’s $21 billion sales of its Speedway retail business provided it with a much-needed cash infusion. The deal also comes with a 15-year fuel-supply agreement under which Marathon Petroleum will supply 7.7 billion gallons of gasoline per year to 7-Eleven, thus ensuring a steady revenue stream.MPC’s exposure to more stable cash flows from the logistics segment diversifies the earnings stream and offers a buffer against the volatile refining business. Consequently, Marathon Petroleum is primed for significant capital appreciation and is viewed as a preferred downstream operator to own now.Marathon Petroleum has an expected earnings growth rate of more than 100% for the current year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings has improved 1.4% over the last seven days.McKesson provides pharmaceuticals and medical supplies in the United States and internationally.

The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings has improved 0.6% over the last seven days.Humana’s Medicaid business, buoyed by several contract wins and renewals, has been strongly contributing to its top line for years.

Shares have been on the move with the stock up 16.4% over the past month. The stock hit a new 52-week high of $183 in the previous session. Genuine Parts has gained 30% since the start of the year compared to the -40.4% move for the Zacks Auto-Tires-Trucks sector and the -4% return for the Zacks Automotive - Replacement Parts industry.What's Driving the Outperformance?The stock has a great record of positive earnings surprises, as it hasn't missed our earnings consensus estimate in any of the last four quarters. In its last earnings report on October 20, 2022, Genuine Parts reported EPS of $2.23 versus consensus estimate of $2.03.For the current fiscal year, Genuine Parts is expected to post earnings of $8.16 per share on $21.88 billion in revenues. This represents a 18.09% change in EPS on a 15.94% change in revenues. For the next fiscal year, the company is expected to earn $8.65 per share on $22.42 billion in revenues. This represents a year-over-year change of 5.95% and 2.49%, respectively.Valuation MetricsGenuine Parts may be at a 52-week high right now, but what might the future hold for the stock? A key aspect of this question is taking a look at valuation metrics in order to determine if the company has run ahead of itself.On this front, we can look at the Zacks Style Scores, as they provide investors with an additional way to sort through stocks (beyond looking at the Zacks Rank of a security). These styles are represented by grades running from A to F in the categories of Value, Growth, and Momentum, while there is a combined VGM Score as well. The idea behind the style scores is to help investors pick the most appropriate Zacks Rank stocks based on their individual investment style.Genuine Parts has a Value Score of B. The stock's Growth and Momentum Scores are B and D, respectively, giving the company a VGM Score of A.In terms of its value breakdown, the stock currently trades at 22.3X current fiscal year EPS estimates, which is a premium to the peer industry average of 13.8X. On a trailing cash flow basis, the stock currently trades at 20.2X versus its peer group's average of 10.8X. Additionally, the stock has a PEG ratio of 1.87. This isn't enough to put the company in the top echelon of all stocks we cover from a value perspective.Story continuesZacks RankWe also need to look at the Zacks Rank for the stock, as this supersedes any trend on the style score front. Fortunately, Genuine Parts currently has a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy) thanks to rising earnings estimates.Since we recommend that investors select stocks carrying Zacks Rank of 1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) and Style Scores of A or B, it looks as if Genuine Parts passes the test. Thus, it seems as though Genuine Parts shares could have potential in the weeks and months to come.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

182,6ce20e39-863a-3c2f-9bd8-76cb6d2a8d13,CMI,2022-11-12,"Cummins Inc. (NYSE:CMI) Looks Interesting, And It's About To Pay A Dividend",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/cummins-inc-nyse-cmi-looks-122626824.html,1668255986,STORY,['CMI'],"[Readers hoping to buy Cummins Inc. (NYSE:CMI) for its dividend will need to make their move shortly, as the stock is about to trade ex-dividend. Typically, the ex-dividend date is one business day before the record date which is the date on which a company determines the shareholders eligible to receive a dividend. The ex-dividend date is important because any transaction on a stock needs to have been settled before the record date in order to be eligible for a dividend. In other words, investors can purchase Cummins' shares before the 17th of November in order to be eligible for the dividend, which will be paid on the 1st of December.The company's next dividend payment will be US$1.57 per share, on the back of last year when the company paid a total of US$6.28 to shareholders. Last year's total dividend payments show that Cummins has a trailing yield of 2.5% on the current share price of $248.17. Dividends are an important source of income to many shareholders, but the health of the business is crucial to maintaining those dividends. As a result, readers should always check whether Cummins has been able to grow its dividends, or if the dividend might be cut. See our latest analysis for Cummins If a company pays out more in dividends than it earned, then the dividend might become unsustainable - hardly an ideal situation. Fortunately Cummins's payout ratio is modest, at just 44% of profit. A useful secondary check can be to evaluate whether Cummins generated enough free cash flow to afford its dividend. It paid out 85% of its free cash flow as dividends, which is within usual limits but will limit the company's ability to lift the dividend if there's no growth.It's encouraging to see that the dividend is covered by both profit and cash flow. This generally suggests the dividend is sustainable, as long as earnings don't drop precipitously.Click here to see the company's payout ratio, plus analyst estimates of its future dividends.Story continueshistoric-dividendHave Earnings And Dividends Been Growing?Businesses with strong growth prospects usually make the best dividend payers, because it's easier to grow dividends when earnings per share are improving. If earnings decline and the company is forced to cut its dividend, investors could watch the value of their investment go up in smoke. Fortunately for readers, Cummins's earnings per share have been growing at 10% a year for the past five years. It paid out more than three-quarters of its earnings in the last year, even though earnings per share are growing rapidly. Higher earnings generally bode well for growing dividends, although with seemingly strong growth prospects we'd wonder why management are not reinvesting more in the business.Many investors will assess a company's dividend performance by evaluating how much the dividend payments have changed over time. In the last 10 years, Cummins has lifted its dividend by approximately 15% a year on average. It's exciting to see that both earnings and dividends per share have grown rapidly over the past few years.Final TakeawayShould investors buy Cummins for the upcoming dividend? From a dividend perspective, we're encouraged to see that earnings per share have been growing, the company is paying out less than half of its earnings, and a bit over half its free cash flow. Cummins looks solid on this analysis overall, and we'd definitely consider investigating it more closely.With that in mind, a critical part of thorough stock research is being aware of any risks that stock currently faces. For example - Cummins has 2 warning signs we think you should be aware of.Generally, we wouldn't recommend just buying the first dividend stock you see.

Shares of the company fell more than 13% on Wednesday following its results.Disney has said the fast-growing service added 12 million subscribers in its fiscal fourth quarter but reported an operating loss of nearly $1.5 billion.

Hiring will be limited to a small subset of critical positions, and some staff reductions are anticipated, as the company looks to make itself more cost-efficient, Chapek wrote.Chapek said business travel would be limited and trips would require advance approval, or conducted virtually as much as possible.""Our transformation is designed to ensure we thrive not just today, but well into the future,"" Chapek wrote.The memo was first reported by CNBC.(Reporting by Dawn Chmielewski in Los Angeles and Chavi Mehta in Bengaluru; Editing by Anil D'Silva, Aurora Ellis and Will Dunham)]"

Now, it's expected to have a massive opening weekend at the box office. And I have already contributed to it. I have already seen it. No spoilers, though. Yahoo Finance's Allie Canal joins us with the details. Hey, Allie.ALEXANDRA CANAL: Hey, Rachelle. I'm so proud of you. You got out there early. I want to ask your opinions about the movie in a second. But yes, you were one of the lucky few who contributed to that Thursday night preview haul. And so far, so good. It's looking nice heading into this opening weekend. Thursday night previews coming in at $28 million for ""Black Panther."" And if we compare that to the original movie in 2018, Thursday previews came in at $25 million. So the sequel just edging out its predecessor there.Overall, the film is expected to gross between $170 million and $205 million domestically. That's according to estimates from Box Office Pro. We saw a pretty solid start overseas, just over $10 million from 17 foreign markets. But that does include China and Russia. Now, there's little hope that this movie will get the green light to debut in China. That country has been super strict when it comes to censorship, which films it ultimately allows into the country.But amid its zero COVID policy, in addition to just how well ""Top Gun-- Maverick"" performed without a China release, Hollywood's dependence on the country doesn't seem as crucial as it once was. Now, that being said, it's still a very important market. And no matter which way you slice it, it still cost studios tens of millions of dollars, especially for these big budget superhero action films that tend to do really well in the country.If you take a look at the OG ""Black Panther"" film, that earned $105 million in just the China markets alone. So it's definitely not nothing. But we've seen Disney, along with some of the other studios, really take a stand against censorship in international territories. And that's led to a lot of praise from the industry. So we'll see if that tends to continue.Story continuesOverall, a lot is riding on the success of this film. We just talked to IMAX CEO yesterday. He said he'd be very surprised if the film does not do well, given the overall audience appeal, the strong reviews, that social media buzz. And, Rachelle, I'm going to kick it back to you on your thoughts. I know you're a huge fan, and you were very excited for the sequel. Did it live up to the hype?RACHELLE AKUFFO: You know what? I think it really did. It's an emotional movie. And I think ""Black Panther,"" I feel like the whole franchise does a really good job of blurring the lines between heroes and villains. Once you actually see it, you'll know. And one thing, because I didn't think I'd be going back to the movies anytime soon, can we talk about this commemorative popcorn tin?DAVE BRIGGS: Wow.RACHELLE AKUFFO: This is a thing of beauty.ALEXANDRA CANAL: That's gorgeous.RACHELLE AKUFFO: Lights up, everything. Right?DAVE BRIGGS: How much was that?RACHELLE AKUFFO: I absolutely love it. So this was $24.99, including the popcorn. But I will say is, to get a piece of something that a movie that I really, really love, I'm not mad at it. The film was beautiful. Don't miss the post-credits scene. Please don't get up before the credits have finished because it's a doozy of a post-credit scene. I'm just saying.DAVE BRIGGS: $25--ALEXANDRA CANAL: Marvel--DAVE BRIGGS: --popcorn. This is the weirdest recession I have ever seen, Allie.RACHELLE AKUFFO: It's a keepsake.ALEXANDRA CANAL: Yeah, I mean-- it's something fun. It's something fun for the diehard fans. And, Rachelle, you're right, Marvel always has little Easter eggs in the post-credits scene. So I agree. If you're going to see this movie, definitely stick around a little longer.

Price and EPS SurpriseDecisionPoint Systems Inc. price-eps-surprise | DecisionPoint Systems Inc. QuoteFactors to ConsiderThe company is expected to have gained as corporations spend more on security and cloud migration as more people are shifting to remote jobs or a hybrid work environment. The company’s extensive product portfolio of managed services and professional services like consulting, staging, and deployment installation is likely to gain traction, owing to the rising complexities of creating, installing and managing a mobile solution. Steady traction witnessed for the company’s reoccurring revenue SaaS solutions, including packaged and custom-developed software, is likely to have favored third-quarter performance.The company plans to further grow its margin by increasing service and software attach rates. The increasing adoption of its products and services across verticals like grocery and specialty retail, healthcare, distribution and transportation, along with geographic expansion, is a tailwind.In the quarter under review, the company completed the re-branding of ExtenData Solutions into DecisionPoint Systems. The acquisition of ExtenData has helped DecisionPoint to improve its regional presence across the Rocky Mountain and Southwest regions of the United States and expand its professional services team.Story continuesAlso, ExtenData’s MobileConductor delivery management platform has also opened up a new SaaS-based subscription revenue stream for DecisionPoint. Previous acquisitions of Advanced Mobile Group and Boston Technologies bode well.However, pandemic-induced global supply-chain troubles and increasing integration risks owing to frequent buyouts might have dented the to-be-reported quarter’s performance.What Our Model SaysOur proven model does not predict an earnings beat for DPSI this time around.

While individual stocks can be big winners, plenty more fail to generate satisfactory returns. Investors in Hasbro, Inc. (NASDAQ:HAS) have tasted that bitter downside in the last year, as the share price dropped 35%. That contrasts poorly with the market decline of 20%. Even if you look out three years, the returns are still disappointing, with the share price down34% in that time. The falls have accelerated recently, with the share price down 21% in the last three months. This could be related to the recent financial results - you can catch up on the most recent data by reading our company report.So let's have a look and see if the longer term performance of the company has been in line with the underlying business' progress. Check out our latest analysis for Hasbro While the efficient markets hypothesis continues to be taught by some, it has been proven that markets are over-reactive dynamic systems, and investors are not always rational. One way to examine how market sentiment has changed over time is to look at the interaction between a company's share price and its earnings per share (EPS).Unfortunately Hasbro reported an EPS drop of 8.8% for the last year. This reduction in EPS is not as bad as the 35% share price fall. Unsurprisingly, given the lack of EPS growth, the market seems to be more cautious about the stock.The image below shows how EPS has tracked over time (if you click on the image you can see greater detail).earnings-per-share-growthWe consider it positive that insiders have made significant purchases in the last year. Having said that, most people consider earnings and revenue growth trends to be a more meaningful guide to the business. Dive deeper into the earnings by checking this interactive graph of Hasbro's earnings, revenue and cash flow.What About Dividends?It is important to consider the total shareholder return, as well as the share price return, for any given stock. Whereas the share price return only reflects the change in the share price, the TSR includes the value of dividends (assuming they were reinvested) and the benefit of any discounted capital raising or spin-off. So for companies that pay a generous dividend, the TSR is often a lot higher than the share price return. We note that for Hasbro the TSR over the last 1 year was -33%, which is better than the share price return mentioned above. And there's no prize for guessing that the dividend payments largely explain the divergence!Story continuesA Different PerspectiveWe regret to report that Hasbro shareholders are down 33% for the year (even including dividends). Unfortunately, that's worse than the broader market decline of 20%. However, it could simply be that the share price has been impacted by broader market jitters. It might be worth keeping an eye on the fundamentals, in case there's a good opportunity. Regrettably, last year's performance caps off a bad run, with the shareholders facing a total loss of 4% per year over five years. We realise that Baron Rothschild has said investors should ""buy when there is blood on the streets"", but we caution that investors should first be sure they are buying a high quality business. I find it very interesting to look at share price over the long term as a proxy for business performance. But to truly gain insight, we need to consider other information, too. For instance, we've identified   2 warning signs for Hasbro  that you should be aware of.There are plenty of other companies that have insiders buying up shares.

You can skip our detailed discussion on dividend stocks and their past performance, and go directly to read 5 Best Consistent Dividend Stocks to Buy. Since the start of this year, the plunging stock prices have investors worried about the future of the market. The stock market has reported negative returns for three consecutive quarters this year for the first time since the global financial crisis of 2009, according to a report by New York Times. The report also mentioned that the S&amp;P 500 ended the quarter with an over 5% decline, which has pushed investors towards defensive stocks. In this regard, dividend stocks like Merck &amp; Co., Inc. (NYSE:MRK), AbbVie Inc. (NYSE:ABBV), and Chevron Corporation (NYSE:CVX) are gaining ground among investors.Historically, dividend stocks have delivered strong returns in previous inflationary periods. Moreover, quality dividend companies have also raised their payouts steadily over the past years regardless of economic conditions. In the past 15 years ending August 2022, the average dividend growth rate stood at 13.71%, compared with a 2.21% growth in the Consumer Price Index (CPI) during the same period, according to S&amp;P Global. The report also highlighted that dividends now represent 6.25% of an income source, growing from 2.88% in 1981.Another report by Sterling Capital mentioned that dividend growers outperformed their peers when inflation ranged between 4% to 13% annually over the past five decades. Analysts recommend dividend stocks due to the compounding effects of dividend income and price appreciation. Over the past 30 years ending December 2021, reinvested dividends for the S&amp;P 500 represented nearly 50% of the total equity market, according to iShares. In view of this, we will discuss consistent dividend stocks in this article.15 Best Consistent Dividend Stocks to BuyImage by Sergei Tokmakov Terms.Law from PixabayOur Methodology:Story continuesFor this list, we selected dividend stocks that have strong dividend histories.

This makes the dividend yield 4.9%, which will augment investor returns quite nicely.While the dividend yield is important for income investors, it is also important to consider any large share price moves, as this will generally outweigh any gains from distributions. Seagate Technology Holdings' stock price has reduced by 31% in the last 3 months, which is not ideal for investors and can explain a sharp increase in the dividend yield. See our latest analysis for Seagate Technology Holdings Seagate Technology Holdings' Payment Has Solid Earnings CoverageImpressive dividend yields are good, but this doesn't matter much if the payments can't be sustained. Based on the last payment, Seagate Technology Holdings was quite comfortably earning enough to cover the dividend. This indicates that quite a large proportion of earnings is being invested back into the business.Over the next year, EPS is forecast to expand by 12.8%. If the dividend continues along recent trends, we estimate the payout ratio will be 45%, which is in the range that makes us comfortable with the sustainability of the dividend.historic-dividendSeagate Technology Holdings Has A Solid Track RecordThe company has a sustained record of paying dividends with very little fluctuation. Since 2012, the annual payment back then was $1.00, compared to the most recent full-year payment of $2.80. This works out to be a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of approximately 11% a year over that time. So, dividends have been growing pretty quickly, and even more impressively, they haven't experienced any notable falls during this period.The Dividend Looks Likely To GrowInvestors who have held shares in the company for the past few years will be happy with the dividend income they have received. We are encouraged to see that Seagate Technology Holdings has grown earnings per share at 16% per year over the past five years. Earnings are on the uptrend, and it is only paying a small portion of those earnings to shareholders.Story continuesWe Really Like Seagate Technology Holdings' DividendIn summary, it is good to see that the dividend is staying consistent, and we don't think there is any reason to suspect this might change over the medium term. Earnings are easily covering distributions, and the company is generating plenty of cash. All in all, this checks a lot of the boxes we look for when choosing an income stock.Investors generally tend to favour companies with a consistent, stable dividend policy as opposed to those operating an irregular one. At the same time, there are other factors our readers should be conscious of before pouring capital into a stock.

(NYSE:UPS) A High Quality Stock To Own?",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/united-parcel-inc-nyse-ups-110140434.html,1668250900,STORY,['UPS'],"[While some investors are already well versed in financial metrics (hat tip), this article is for those who would like to learn about Return On Equity (ROE) and why it is important. By way of learning-by-doing, we'll look at ROE to gain a better understanding of United Parcel Service, Inc. (NYSE:UPS).ROE or return on equity is a useful tool to assess how effectively a company can generate returns on the investment it received from its shareholders. In short, ROE shows the profit each dollar generates with respect to its shareholder investments. See our latest analysis for United Parcel Service How Do You Calculate Return On Equity?Return on equity can be calculated by using the formula:Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' EquitySo, based on the above formula, the ROE for United Parcel Service is:66% = US$11b ÷ US$17b (Based on the trailing twelve months to September 2022).The 'return' is the yearly profit. That means that for every $1 worth of shareholders' equity, the company generated $0.66 in profit.Does United Parcel Service Have A Good Return On Equity?One simple way to determine if a company has a good return on equity is to compare it to the average for its industry. However, this method is only useful as a rough check, because companies do differ quite a bit within the same industry classification. Pleasingly, United Parcel Service has a superior ROE than the average (27%) in the Logistics industry.roeThat's clearly a positive. Bear in mind, a high ROE doesn't always mean superior financial performance. Especially when a firm uses high levels of debt to finance its debt which may boost its ROE but the high leverage puts the company at risk. You can see the 2 risks we have identified for United Parcel Service by visiting our risks dashboard for free  on our platform here.How Does Debt Impact Return On Equity?Most companies need money -- from somewhere -- to grow their profits. That cash can come from issuing shares, retained earnings, or debt. In the first and second cases, the ROE will reflect this use of cash for investment in the business. In the latter case, the debt used for growth will improve returns, but won't affect the total equity. That will make the ROE look better than if no debt was used.Story continuesUnited Parcel Service's Debt And Its 66% ROEIt's worth noting the high use of debt by United Parcel Service, leading to its debt to equity ratio of 1.18. Its ROE is pretty impressive but, it would have probably been lower without the use of debt. Debt increases risk and reduces options for the company in the future, so you generally want to see some good returns from using it.SummaryReturn on equity is useful for comparing the quality of different businesses. Companies that can achieve high returns on equity without too much debt are generally of good quality. If two companies have around the same level of debt to equity, and one has a higher ROE, I'd generally prefer the one with higher ROE.Having said that, while ROE is a useful indicator of business quality, you'll have to look at a whole range of factors to determine the right price to buy a stock. Profit growth rates, versus the expectations reflected in the price of the stock, are a particularly important to consider. So you might want to take a peek at this data-rich interactive graph of forecasts for the company.Of course, you might find a fantastic investment by looking elsewhere.

The day, which falls on Nov. 26 this year, is aimed at showcasing smaller businesses during the kickoff weekend of the holiday shopping season.In 2011, the U.S. Senate passed a resolution to recognize the day. That same year, the Small Business Saturday Coalition was formed, and the event was cosponsored by the Small Business Administration.More from WWDSpring 2023: A Whirlwind Fashion Week in New YorkA Look Inside Destree's First StoreWhy the Fiorucci Store Was the Mother of All Retail ConceptsWhile the day is bookended by Black Friday and Cyber Monday, Small Business Saturday has slowly muscled its way into getting the attention of shoppers.In American Express’ latest Amex Trendex report, 72 percent of consumers said they prefer to shop at small businesses during the holidays to get more personalized and unique gifts, while 77 percent of respondents said they believe it’s more important than ever to support small businesses this holiday season. And for 72 percent of consumers, supporting small businesses means dining out at favorite local restaurants.The Small Business Association defines a small business as one with fewer than 500 employees. In the U.S., there are 32.5 million small businesses. The companies with fewer than 20 employees total 23 million. Many are importers, exporters, small manufacturers, pureplay e-commerce retailers, health care and medical firms, food and beverage companies, restaurants, convenience stores, supermarkets, gas stations and trade crafts, as well as service companies in finance, banking and insurance, among other sectors.But the number of “mom-and-pop” merchants is small by comparison. According to IBISWorld, there are just over 151,000 businesses that categorize themselves as “small, specialty retail stores.” Many of those merchants were hard hit by the COVID-19 outbreak. The SBA said in a statement: “This year, we know that small businesses need our support now more than ever as they navigate, retool and pivot from the effects of the coronavirus pandemic.”American Express has set up a special website to help shoppers find and support a small business. The site uses location services on smartphones and computers to show the location of the nearest merchant (who, of course, accepts American Express). The site also touts special deals at small businesses for American Express cardholders.For small businesses, American Express features tools and marketing materials as well as offers with various partner companies such as FedEx, Constant Contact and Intuit Quickbooks.]"

Nonetheless, a boost in infrastructural and public construction spending should continue to act as a major tailwind. Also, an improving non-residential construction market and favorable pricing dynamics have been aiding companies in navigating hard times. Prominent names in the industry, like Vulcan Materials Company VMC, Martin Marietta Materials, Inc. MLM, Eagle Materials Inc. EXP and Summit Materials, Inc. SUM, have been gaining from the positives.Industry DescriptionThe Zacks Building Products - Concrete &amp; Aggregates industry consists of manufacturers, distributors and sellers of construction materials like aggregates and concrete along with other related items for public infrastructure, residential and non-residential, as well as other end markets. The materials also include gypsum wallboard, recycled paperboard, concrete blocks, ready-mix concrete, and oil and gas proppants. The industry players are also involved in designing, engineering, manufacturing, marketing, and installation of external building products for commercial, residential, and repair and remodel markets in domestic as well as international markets.3 Trends Shaping the Future of Concrete &amp; Aggregates IndustryFluctuation in Input Prices, Weather Woes, Residential Slowdown, &amp; Shortage of Skilled Labors: The industry players are struggling with escalating material expenses, the shortage of skilled laborers and rising wage costs. The companies use electricity, diesel fuel, liquid asphalt and other petroleum-based resources. Hence, supply-related woes and significant fluctuations in the prices of these resources affect operating results. Also, the businesses are exposed to weather-related risks that affect production schedules and hence profitability. Excessive rainfall, flooding or severe droughts jeopardize shipments and production. The first and fourth quarters are mostly affected by winter. Again, hurricanes in the Atlantic Ocean and Gulf Coast are most active during these quarters. These impediments may continue to bump up costs and mar the industry participants’ profits. This apart, the recent slowdown in the residential market is causing a downdraft in wallboard, cement and other products of the industry, thereby weighing on the companies’ performance. Notably, rising mortage rates and home prices have been prompting a moderation in housing demand.Focus on Reviving Infrastructure: On Nov 15, 2021, President Joe Biden signed a bipartisan infrastructure bill of $550 billion, in addition to the approved funds of $450 billion for five years in August. Total spending may go up to $1.2 trillion if the plan is extended to eight years. This bill comprises new investments in almost every infrastructure sector over the next five-year period, including transportation, energy, broadband and water. Out of the total allotted spending, the infrastructure development law will provide $100 billion toward roads, bridges and other major projects. It will invest $66 billion in freight and passenger rail, including potential upgrades to Amtrak. The project will allocate $11 billion to reducing car crashes and fatalities through a “Safe Streets for All” program. The Biden administration’s endeavor to pump money for rebuilding the nation's roads, bridges and other infrastructure would give construction companies like Vulcan, Martin Marietta and others a solid foundation for growth.Acquisitions &amp; Focus on Operating Efficiency: The industry participants follow a well-chalked-out acquisition plan to enhance domestic and international portfolios. Moreover, companies are increasingly focusing on reducing controllable costs and maximizing operating efficiency across business lines to generate higher earnings and cash flows. The industry players also have been experiencing a solid pricing environment across their product portfolios, thereby helping to boost margins.Story continuesZacks Industry Rank Indicates Dull ProspectsThe Zacks Building Products - Concrete &amp; Aggregates industry is a nine-stock group within the broader Zacks Construction sector. The industry currently carries a Zacks Industry Rank #179, which places it in the bottom 29% of more than 250 Zacks industries.The group’s Zacks Industry Rank, which is basically the average of the Zacks Rank of all the member stocks, indicates bleak near-term prospects. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperform the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.The industry’s positioning in the bottom 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries is a result of a weak earnings outlook for the constituent companies in aggregate. Looking at the aggregate earnings estimate revisions, it appears that analysts are gradually losing confidence in this group’s bottom-line growth potential. Since October 2022, the industry’s earnings estimates for 2022 and 2023 have been revised 1.2% and 2.1% downward.Despite the industry’s gloomy near-term view, we will present a few stocks that one may consider adding to the portfolio. Before that, it’s worth taking a look at the industry’s shareholder returns and current valuation.Industry Outperforms Sector, Lags S&amp;P 500The Zacks Building Products - Concrete &amp; Aggregates industry has outperformed the broader Zacks Construction sector but lagged the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite over the past year.Stocks in this industry have collectively lost 22.8% versus the broader sector’s decline of 25.4% over the past year. Meanwhile, the S&amp;P 500 has slipped 21.5% in the same period.One-Year Price PerformanceIndustry's Current ValuationOn the basis of the forward 12-month price to earnings, which is a commonly used multiple for valuing Building Products - Concrete &amp; Aggregates stocks, the industry is currently trading at 16.2X versus the S&amp;P 500’s 16.6X and the sector’s 11.8X.Over the past five years, the industry has traded as high as 24.5X, as low as 13.5X and at a median of 19.4X, as the chart below shows.Industry’s P/E Ratio (Forward 12-Month) Versus S&amp;P 5004 Concrete &amp; Aggregates Stocks to Keep a Close Eye OnNone of the stocks in the Zacks Concrete &amp; Aggregates universe currently carries a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy).

You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here. Summit Materials: Based in Denver, CO, this is a construction material company. Summit Materials has been witnessing solid pricing growth across all lines of business and expects the trend to continue in 2023. The company has also been optimizing its portfolio as it intends to shift toward a more materials-led portfolio. Meanwhile, the company remains optimistic as it believes public markets are poised to experience robust and durable growth driven by well-funded state budgets and as infrastructure funding begins to flow through. A solid state DOT budgets flow will aid the company, which has been receiving more contracts associated to highways and related works.Summit Materials has gained 26.7% over the past year, underperforming the industry’s 22.8% decline. This Zacks Rank #3 company’s earnings estimates for 2023 are expected to grow 50.9%.Price and Consensus: SUMVulcan Materials Company: This Birmingham, AL-based company produces and supplies construction aggregates, asphalt mix as well as ready-mixed concrete. The company’s focus on four strategic initiatives — Commercial Excellence, Operational Excellence, Strategic Sourcing, and Logistics Innovation — should enhance price performance as well as operating efficiencies. Vulcan Materials has been generating higher earnings despite tepid revenues on the back of prudent cost-control efforts and increased pricing in aggregates. Its focus on a systematic inorganic strategy for expansion is adding to the positives. Overall, improving private non-residential construction, solid infrastructure investment and favorable pricing dynamics have been driving growth.Vulcan currently carries a Zacks Rank #3. The company’s shares have dropped 13.3% over the past year. Earnings for 2023 are expected to grow 26.5%.Price and Consensus: VMCMartin Marietta Materials: Based in Raleigh, NC, Martin Marietta produces and supplies construction aggregates as well as other heavy building materials — mainly cement — in the United States. Expanded infrastructure investment, along with recovering private non-residential markets and heavy industrial projects of scale, are expected to support near-term shipment levels. Also, the Lehigh West Region and Tiller buyouts should enhance its reach in new geographies for persistent industry-leading growth.Martin Marietta currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 and has slipped 17.6% in the past year. Earnings for 2023 are expected to rise 21.7%.Price and Consensus: MLMEagle Materials: This Dallas, TX-based company produces and supplies heavy construction materials, light building materials, and materials used for oil and natural gas extraction in the United States. Improved cement, concrete and aggregates sales volume as well as a solid contribution from the recently acquired Kosmos Cement business are aiding the company’s growth.

Email marco.quiroz-gutierrez@fortune.com with tips.The failed Binance and FTX deal and the continued unraveling of the latter sent crypto prices tumbling, but its effect on NFTs has been something of a mixed bag.Early on Thursday, less than a day after the FTX and Binance deal fell through, blue-chip NFT collections were down about 15%, according to DappRadar Head of Research Pedro Herrera. Some collections like Bored Ape Yacht Club and Mutant Ape Yacht Club fell by double digit percentage points.By early Friday, though, those collections had rebounded in a major way, with CryptoPunks emerging as the biggest winner. The Yuga Labs collection surpassed Yuga’s other flagship collection Bored Ape Yacht Club as the most valuable on the market, with a 24% increase in its price floor to about $85,100 over 24 hours. Meanwhile, the lowest price for a Bored Ape jumped 12% to about $77,700 over the same period, according to DappRadar.While CryptoPunks were once the most expensive NFT collection, Bored Ape Yacht Club took over that distinction in December. Now, CryptoPunks has recovered its crown—at least for the moment.Compared to top cryptocurrencies Bitcoin and Ether, NFTs have better resisted the headwinds of the FTX debacle. As of Friday morning, the price of one Bitcoin was about $17,300, up about 5% but still trading at a level not seen since 2020. Ether was up about 7% to $1,300.Still, the NFT world is facing its own controversy. More and more marketplaces have eliminated required royalty payments, which give the original creators of an NFT a portion of every sale, and some digital artists are not happy.Just this week, FEWOCiOUS, XCOPY, and Seneca, the artist behind the Bored Ape Yacht Club art, spoke out in favor of royalties.FEWOCiOUS, whose real name is Victor Langlois, put it clearly in a tweet: “Royalties were the reason the art community flocked to NFTs in the first place.”Story continueshttps://twitter.com/fewocious/status/1589710002545397760The protests from creators have already made some headway with the most popular NFT marketplace, OpenSea, which said it would continue to enforce royalties on its collections after previously saying it was reconsidering its policy.In other news: Capital One filed eight trademark applications for NFTs and NFT-backed media as well as debit and credit card services in the metaverse, according to a tweet by trademark attorney Mike Kondoudis. The company also could provide financial services and other events in the metaverse in the future, according to its filing.Wrangler released a dark denim Wrangler jacket on Friday in partnership with the NFT collection Deadfellaz.In partnership with the NFT collection Deadfellaz, apparel and jeans maker Wrangler on Friday released a dark denim Wrangler jacket covered in Deadfellaz graffiti and a black T-shirt celebrating The Horde, the tight-knit Deadfellaz community. The Deadfellaz NFT collection features 10,000 undead NFTs owned by celebrities like NFL player Odell Beckham Jr. and Reese Witherspoon.SuperRare Labs announced RarePass, a set of 250 passes to be auctioned off on Nov. 15 that will give buyers airdropped NFTs and special perks on the SuperRare NFT marketplace. For one year, the RarePass holders will get one airdrop per month from 12 artists who will create a series of 250 unique works, one for each pass holder. The artists include XCOPY, Pindar Van Arman, Coldie, Matt Kane, Krista Kim, Carlos Marcial, Other World, OSF, Robness, Helena Sarin, Anne Spalter, and Sarah Zucker. Six passes will be given away randomly, with two going to existing collectors, two to existing artists, and a final two to existing $RARE token holders.The relaunched DRESSX app lets users try on NFT clothes purchased from the company’s marketplace using augmented reality technology.DRESSX, an app that serves as a “Metacloset'' of digital-only clothes, relaunched its app this week to give users the ability to connect a MetaMask wallet and try on NFT digital clothing purchased from its marketplace for free by using augmented reality.This story was originally featured on Fortune.comMore from Fortune: The U.S. housing market to see second biggest correction of the post-WWII era—when to expect the home price bottomSam Bankman-Fried’s failed crypto empire ‘was run by a gang of kids in the Bahamas’ who all dated each otherCOVID cases are on the rise again this autumn.

That is because the Jan 20, 2023 $44.40 Call had some of the highest implied volatility of all equity options today.What is Implied Volatility?Implied volatility shows how much movement the market is expecting in the future. Options with high levels of implied volatility suggest that investors in the underlying stocks are expecting a big move in one direction or the other. It could also mean there is an event coming up soon that may cause a big rally or a huge sell-off. However, implied volatility is only one piece of the puzzle when putting together an options trading strategy.What do the Analysts Think?Clearly, options traders are pricing in a big move for Capital One shares, but what is the fundamental picture for the company? Currently, Capital One is a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) in the Financial - Consumer Loans industry that ranks in the Bottom 7% of our Zacks Industry Rank. Over the last 60 days, four analysts have increased their earnings estimates for the current quarter, while seven have dropped their estimates. The net effect has taken our Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current quarter from $4.25 per share to $4.17 in that period.Given the way analysts feel about Capital One right now, this huge implied volatility could mean there’s a trade developing. Oftentimes, options traders look for options with high levels of implied volatility to sell premium. This is a strategy many seasoned traders use because it captures decay. At expiration, the hope for these traders is that the underlying stock does not move as much as originally expected.Looking to Trade Options?Check out the simple yet high-powered approach that Zacks Executive VP Kevin Matras has used to close recent double and triple-digit winners.

Its stellar track record and consistent financial performance earn glowing accolades from investors and market analysts. This high-quality stock is relatively resistant to volatile economic climates, where all too often, other companies experience sudden twists and turns. Coca-Cola's recent impressive earnings figures once again prove that it has what it takes to weather the storm, as it made steady returns despite price hikes.Warning! GuruFocus has detected 4 Warning Sign with KO. Click here to check it out. KO 15-Year Financial DataThe intrinsic value of KOPeter Lynch Chart of KOWith an attractive trailing 12-month dividend yield of 2.87% and a robust stock buyback program, Coca-Cola could represent a lucrative opportunity for risk-averse investors looking for long-term growth and stability, in my opinion. After all, when it comes to beverage branding success, pricing power and even shareholder-friendliness, Coca-Cola leads the pack.Price hikes fail to dent Coca-Cola's momentumDespite rising inflation and interest rates, Coca-Cola reported strong performance in the third quarter. Consumers continue to flock to their favorite carbonated drinks and juices, driving higher sales volumes even as prices rise. Coca-Cola's revenue has grown by 10% year-over-year to $11.1 billion, while profit increased by 14% - even higher than inflation! This robust performance shows that consumers remain willing to pay a premium for Coca-Cola's high-quality products and strong brand image. Organic revenue growth was 16%, while earnings per share grew by a healthy 14%,For Coca-Cola, the biggest positive to come out of the recent earnings report is that rising prices did not severely impact the company in the global carbonated beverages market. Coca-Cola still dominates the industry. Therefore, the company can afford to increase prices in the face of economic headwinds. This stability can be attributed to Coca-Cola's near-monopoly of the carbonated drinks market in terms of customer share of mind, which has given it greater control over pricing decisions. In addition, Coca-Cola has seen strong growth in unit case volumes even with average selling prices increasing by 12%. Coca-Cola's resilience amidst shifting market conditions is a testament to its longstanding success and dominance within this highly competitive industry.Story continuesWith the rise in sales of food and beverages, Coca-Cola expects organic revenue to increase by 14% to 15% in 2022, compared to previous estimates of 12% to 13% growth. Meanwhile, full-year adjusted earnings per share growth are forecast to range from 6% to 7%, up from previous estimates of 5% to 6%.Focus on diversification is paying dividendsCoca-Cola has long been one of the world's most iconic and popular brands, thanks to its refreshing flavors and wide range of products. Over recent quarters, Coca-Cola has seen incredible growth as a result of shaking up its offerings to keep up with rising consumer demand while simultaneously cutting underperforming products and raising its prices to respond to inflation. This strong performance has been very well-received by Coca-Cola's loyal customer base, with sales figures showing significant increases across the board.Furthermore, Coca-Cola's management is continuously looking for new ways to drive further growth for the company, evidenced by its focus on adding more variety and flavor options to its existing product lineup. By keeping on top of market trends and new opportunities, Coca-Cola increases its chances of staying at the top of consumers' minds for years to come.This focus on innovation has led to some exciting developments for the company, including its popular zero-sugar Coca-Cola drinks. Introducing new sizes, flavors and other versions of the sugar-free drink has helped Coca-Cola appeal to many customers who are pting for healthier drink options. With Coca-Cola's volume for Coca-Cola Zero Sugar increasing by 11% in the most recent quarter, it is clear the zero-sugar trend is still going strong.TakeawayFor the above reasons, I believe Coca-Cola remains a great investment during times of volatility. It won't be making millionaires anymore, but its stability makes up for this in a time of unexpected market swings. It recently delivered stellar earnings, and the company is not stopping on the way to the fourth quarter. In addition, the beverage giant is a time-tested Dividend King. It has raised its dividend for 60 consecutive years. This is an extremely impressive history.Coca-Cola is one of the most iconic brands in the world and has built up a huge moat around its business. The company has a huge amount of brand equity and is unlikely to lose its spot as one of the world's most valuable brands any time soon. Coca-Cola also has a wide geographic reach, selling products in over 200 countries. The company's global reach gives it significant advantages over its competitors. Coca-Cola also has a strong track record of innovation, launching new products and cutting out-of-favor products to keep profitability strong. Add in Coca-Cola's franchising business model, which relies on licensing production out to independent manufacturers, it's clear to see the company also has a focus on reducing its exposure to asset risks, which has greatly helped its stability over the years.This article first appeared on GuruFocus.]"

(NYSE:MHK) Shares Could Be 49% Below Their Intrinsic Value Estimate",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/mohawk-industries-inc-nyse-mhk-121447672.html,1668255287,STORY,['MHK'],"[Does the November share price for Mohawk Industries, Inc. (NYSE:MHK) reflect what it's really worth? Today, we will estimate the stock's intrinsic value by taking the forecast future cash flows of the company and discounting them back to today's value. The Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model is the tool we will apply to do this. There's really not all that much to it, even though it might appear quite complex.Remember though, that there are many ways to estimate a company's value, and a DCF is just one method. Anyone interested in learning a bit more about intrinsic value should have a read of the Simply Wall St analysis model. See our latest analysis for Mohawk Industries The CalculationWe use what is known as a 2-stage model, which simply means we have two different periods of growth rates for the company's cash flows. Generally the first stage is higher growth, and the second stage is a lower growth phase. To start off with, we need to estimate the next ten years of cash flows. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.Generally we assume that a dollar today is more valuable than a dollar in the future, so we discount the value of these future cash flows to their estimated value in today's dollars:10-year free cash flow (FCF) forecast2023202420252026202720282029203020312032 Levered FCF ($, Millions) US$802.1mUS$616.4mUS$773.5mUS$932.3mUS$983.6mUS$1.03bUS$1.07bUS$1.10bUS$1.13bUS$1.16bGrowth Rate Estimate SourceAnalyst x7Analyst x4Analyst x2Analyst x2Est @ 5.5%Est @ 4.44%Est @ 3.7%Est @ 3.19%Est @ 2.82%Est @ 2.57% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 8.7% US$738US$522US$603US$669US$649US$624US$596US$566US$535US$505(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$6.0bStory continuesThe second stage is also known as Terminal Value, this is the business's cash flow after the first stage. For a number of reasons a very conservative growth rate is used that cannot exceed that of a country's GDP growth. In this case we have used the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield (2.0%) to estimate future growth. In the same way as with the 10-year 'growth' period, we discount future cash flows to today's value, using a cost of equity of 8.7%.Terminal Value (TV)= FCF2032 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$1.2b× (1 + 2.0%) ÷ (8.7%– 2.0%) = US$18bPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$18b÷ ( 1 + 8.7%)10= US$7.7bThe total value, or equity value, is then the sum of the present value of the future cash flows, which in this case is US$14b. In the final step we divide the equity value by the number of shares outstanding. Relative to the current share price of US$110, the company appears quite undervalued at a 49% discount to where the stock price trades currently. Valuations are imprecise instruments though, rather like a telescope - move a few degrees and end up in a different galaxy. Do keep this in mind.dcfThe AssumptionsNow the most important inputs to a discounted cash flow are the discount rate, and of course, the actual cash flows. You don't have to agree with these inputs, I recommend redoing the calculations yourself and playing with them. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Mohawk Industries as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 8.7%, which is based on a levered beta of 1.302. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.Moving On:Valuation is only one side of the coin in terms of building your investment thesis, and it shouldn't be the only metric you look at when researching a company. DCF models are not the be-all and end-all of investment valuation. Instead the best use for a DCF model is to test certain assumptions and theories to see if they would lead to the company being undervalued or overvalued. If a company grows at a different rate, or if its cost of equity or risk free rate changes sharply, the output can look very different. Can we work out why the company is trading at a discount to intrinsic value?

One common approach is to try and find a company with returns on capital employed (ROCE) that are increasing, in conjunction with a growing amount of capital employed. Ultimately, this demonstrates that it's a business that is reinvesting profits at increasing rates of return. That's why when we briefly looked at Waste Management's (NYSE:WM) ROCE trend, we were pretty happy with what we saw.Return On Capital Employed (ROCE): What Is It?Just to clarify if you're unsure, ROCE is a metric for evaluating how much pre-tax income (in percentage terms) a company earns on the capital invested in its business. The formula for this calculation on Waste Management is:Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)0.13 = US$3.3b ÷ (US$30b - US$3.8b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to September 2022).So, Waste Management has an ROCE of 13%.  In absolute terms, that's a satisfactory return, but compared to the Commercial Services industry average of 9.5% it's much better. Check out our latest analysis for Waste Management roceAbove you can see how the current ROCE for Waste Management compares to its prior returns on capital, but there's only so much you can tell from the past. If you're interested, you can view the analysts predictions in our free report on analyst forecasts for the company.The Trend Of ROCEWhile the returns on capital are good, they haven't moved much. Over the past five years, ROCE has remained relatively flat at around 13% and the business has deployed 47% more capital into its operations. 13% is a pretty standard return, and it provides some comfort knowing that Waste Management has consistently earned this amount. Stable returns in this ballpark can be unexciting, but if they can be maintained over the long run, they often provide nice rewards to shareholders.Story continuesIn Conclusion...To sum it up, Waste Management has simply been reinvesting capital steadily, at those decent rates of return. And the stock has done incredibly well with a 115% return over the last five years, so long term investors are no doubt ecstatic with that result. So while the positive underlying trends may be accounted for by investors, we still think this stock is worth looking into further.On a separate note, we've found   1 warning sign for Waste Management   you'll probably want to know about.If you want to search for solid companies with great earnings, check out this free list of companies with good balance sheets and impressive returns on equity.Have feedback on this article?

We don't have to wait 4 months to figure out what would happen if we imitated George Soros' growth stock picks. The original article will be presented in quotations whereas our new comments will be in regular paragraphs:George Soros is an American investor and the founder of Soros Fund Management. Whenever George Soros makes an investment decision, the market notices it. In Q1 2022, the value of the billionaire’s US stock holdings saw a decrease of about $2 billion. The decline was driven by a lowering of his stake in Rivian Automotive, Inc. (NASDAQ:RIVN) and the closing of some of the major holdings, such as IHS Markit Ltd.George Soros was right about trimming his market exposure, dumping his IHS position whose stock lost 40% of its value, and cutting his stake in Rivian Automotive (RIVN) which lost a quarter of its value.Keeping in view the current economic situation, George Soros discouraged investors from investing in China as the country’s real estate boom was dying down. As reported by CNN in February, Soros stated that the “unsustainable” model had enticed many to invest in property and real estate companies at a time when China was finding itself in the middle of an economic crisis. To support his perspective, the billionaire discussed the case of Evergrande, a real estate group in China that is struggling to repay its liabilities due to stringent national policies.George Soros was also right about Chinese stocks as Chinese heavyweights like Alibaba (BABA) lost a third of its value since the end of the first quarter.Despite the economic certainty, Soros Fund Management has not taken refuge in defensive stocks like most investment firms in Q1 2022. Instead, the hedge fund has initiated new positions or increased its holdings in growth stocks that have been outperforming the broader market. The fund’s chief executive and chief investment officer, Dawn Fitzpatrick, stated that even though inflation is rising at a faster rate than the increase in wages, US consumer still has enough money to settle their credit card debts. In an interview with Bloomberg, Fitzpatrick appeared unfazed by the inevitable recession and added that “rate increases will slow the economy and will impact inflation, but this economy has some shock absorbers built-in.”Story continuesFitzpatrick was proven right over the last 6 months. We haven't seen any increase in unemployment rate and the US consumers are still very strong. Yet, the inflation rate finally started to come down. On the other hand, growth stocks haven't been doing well since the end of the first quarter.Out of the ten stocks covered in this article, Soros Fund Management has increased its stake in eight stocks either by initiating a new position or adding to its previous holdings. Unlike Warren Buffett, who believes in value investing in entities with strong fundamentals and financials with a long-term investment horizon, Soros is a contrarian and speculative investor who relies on short-term movements in the market. Some of the notable names included in Soros’ Q1 2022 portfolio are Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG), Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), and Salesforce, Inc. (NYSE:CRM).best high yield dividend stocks according to george sorosWe have used the first quarter portfolio of Soros Fund Management to select these stocks. Companies with strong business fundamentals and growth prospects have been analyzed. Furthermore, we have also mentioned the number of hedge fund holders for each stock to give investors an idea about the popularity of these companies amongst institutional investors. Over 900 elite funds were tracked by Insider Monkey at the end of Q1 2022 to determine the hedge fund sentiment.The five stocks that we covered below, Proterra Inc (PTRA), Qualcomm Incorporated (QCOM), Aptiv PLC (APTV), Intuit Inc (INTU), indie Semiconductor Inc. (INDI) lost an average of 6.5% since the end of the first quarter, but outperformed the S&amp;P 500 ETF (SPY)'s 11% loss during the same period.

(NASDAQ:PTRA) is a Burlingame, California-based commercial electric vehicles (EVs) designer and manufacturer that went public at the peak of the special purpose acquisition vehicle (SPAC) boom during Q2 2021. Proterra Inc. (NASDAQ:PTRA) has sold 1,300 buses to more than 135 transit agencies across 43 US and Canadian states since its inception. The company provides not only commercial EVs but also offers complete charging solutions.Proterra Inc. (NASDAQ:PTRA) stock has lost 70% of its value since its IPO and has been engulfed with ongoing supply chain issues. Soros Management’s current holding is still equivalent to 2% of the company, making it the third biggest hedge fund holder of the stock. Michael Shlisky at DA Davidson also has a positive outlook on Proterra Inc. (NASDAQ:PTRA) as he initiated coverage on the stock with a Buy rating and a price target of $10 in a note issued on June 1. The analyst considers Proterra Inc. (NASDAQ:PTRA) stock as one of the pre-vetted, quality EV-truck companies. Shlisky added that the organization is also coming up as a first-choice battery provider to manufacturers of electric trucks.As of Q1 2022, Proterra Inc. (NASDAQ:PTRA) was held by 16 hedge funds.9.

The company has a bright outlook as it has been reported that the Cupertino, California-based tech giant Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) has failed to come up with its own 5G chips for iPhones. Hence, it would have to rely upon QUALCOMM Incorporated (NASDAQ:QCOM) as its exclusive partner.QUALCOMM Incorporated (NASDAQ:QCOM) would be responsible for providing 100% of the chips for iPhones produced till the second half of the next year. This will surely provide an impetus to the top line and bottom line of the company. By the time Apple is prepared to replace Qualcomm’s chips in its devices, QUALCOMM Incorporated’s (NASDAQ:QCOM) other businesses would have matured and would counteract the adverse effect of losing the partnership.QUALCOMM Incorporated (NASDAQ:QCOM) was discussed in the Q4 2021 investor of ClearBridge Investments. Here’s what the firm said:“Market strength continued in the fourth quarter, with only the communication services sector down in the Russell 1000 Value Index. Portfolio returns benefited from the strong performance of semiconductor maker Qualcomm, which has executed exceptionally well in pursuing the transition to 5G, growing both content and share due to its leadership position in cellular technology. The chipmaker recently outlined a number of peripheral growth opportunities outside of mobile markets, including automotive (where it hopes to leverage its strong presence in the automotive infotainment space into advanced driver assistance systems), Internet of Things (including opportunities in the PC market, VR/AR market, and factory automation) and radio frequency (where mmWave adoption globally, including China, would drive substantial upside).”QUALCOMM Incorporated (NASDAQ:QCOM) was held by 73 funds at the end of Q1 2022.8.

The analyst gave the rating and target price, keeping in view the existing supply chain challenges in the short-term along with an anticipation of lower demand in the medium term. Delaney anticipates automobile production of 79 million in 2022 and 84 million in 2023 globally. The analyst lowered the US seasonal adjusted annual rate (SAAR) forecast to 14.5 million for 2022 due to rising interest rates and high inflation. Aptiv PLC (NYSE:APTV) is expected to be a beneficiary of faster EV adoption.Aptiv PLC (NYSE:APTV) was mentioned in the Q1 2022 investor letter of ClearBridge Investments. Here’s what the firm said:“The acceleration in electrification of transport should support electric vehicle (EV)-related stocks like Aptiv (NYSE:APTV), which came under pressure in the quarter on concerns the auto cycle is past its peak. Aptiv provides a range of solutions for the auto industry, including autonomous driving technologies, safety technologies, components, and wiring. The large exposure of APTV to EVs should lead to long-term value as EVs continue their growth, boosted by their relative attractiveness as prices at the pump hit near-historic highs.”Aptiv PLC (NYSE:APTV) was held by 48 elite funds at the end of Q1 2022.7.

(NASDAQ:INTU) is a Palo Alto, California-based software corporation that specializes in developing financial software.On May 25, Brad Reback at Stifel gave Intuit Inc. (NASDAQ:INTU) stock a Buy rating with a price target of $465. The analyst highlighted that the company delivered strong Q3 FY22 results despite a weak tax season. The impact of the weak tax season was countered by the strong performance of the company’s two brands, Credit Karma and Mailchimp. During the earnings calls, the management reiterated several times that the business is not getting impacted by economic uncertainty. However, Intuit Inc. (NASDAQ:INTU) is still exposed to a slowdown in the overall economy despite the size and diversity of its offerings ranging from Mint, QuickBooks, and TurboTax. Following the quarterly results, Intuit Inc. (NASDAQ:INTU) also raised its FY22 EPS guidance.Baron Funds discussed its stance on Intuit Inc. (NASDAQ:INTU) in its Q1 2022 investor letter. Here’s what the firm said:“At the company-specific level, with 59% of our holdings posting double-digit declines during the quarter, we had no chance to hold up against the Index that was down less than 5%. The good news is that for the most part, this draw-down did not result in a permanent loss of capital and in many cases, we believe fundamentals have remained robust or improved even though stock prices declined. One example is Intuit (NASDAQ:INTU), the leading provider of accounting software, and our second largest detractor in the quarter. The stock lost 25% of its value (or over $45 billion) due to a miss in quarterly revenues, which was driven by a slower start to the tax season, leading the company to miss consensus estimates for consumer revenues by about $190 million. The slower start to the tax season is of course insignificant to the intrinsic value of the business, as everyone knows there are only two certainties in life and one of them is – TAXES! And so, naturally, Intuit reaffirmed its annual projections. Moreover, results in other segments were ahead of expectations. CEO Sasan Goodarzi explained the outperformance during its quarterly conference call by saying:‘We have a nearly $300 billion addressable market driven by tailwinds that include a shift to virtual solutions, an acceleration to online and omni-channel capabilities, and digital money offerings. This, combined with the team’s excellence and execution is contributing to the strength of our performance.’More specifically, Intuit is gaining market share in tax filings (“we are on track to gain share overall again this season”), continues expanding its QuickBooks online offering, which was up 35% year-over-year, and is seeing strong synergies from its Credit Karma acquisition, driven by Intuit’s Lightbox technology, which allows better personalization of offerings to customers (for example, it “doubles the average approval rate for members who apply for credit cards on Credit Karma versus outside of Credit Karma”). The bottom line is that our estimates of Intuit’s intrinsic value were up while the stock price was down and therefore our future expected return has increased.”Overall, 82 funds held a stake in Intuit Inc.

Indie has strong market share in applications such as Apple CarPlay and ultrasonic parking assist with multiple contracts ramping in the coming quarters in applications such as advanced lighting controls, telematics, and electrification.

DVA need to pay close attention to the stock based on moves in the options market lately. That is because the Jan 20, 2023 $55.00 Call had some of the highest implied volatility of all equity options today.What is Implied Volatility?Implied volatility shows how much movement the market is expecting in the future. Options with high levels of implied volatility suggest that investors in the underlying stocks are expecting a big move in one direction or the other. It could also mean there is an event coming up soon that may cause a big rally or a huge sell-off. However, implied volatility is only one piece of the puzzle when putting together an options trading strategy.What do the Analysts Think?Clearly, options traders are pricing in a big move for DaVita shares, but what is the fundamental picture for the company? Currently, DaVita is a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) in the Medical - Outpatient and Home Healthcare industry that ranks in the Bottom 17% of our Zacks Industry Rank. Over the last 30 days, no analysts have increased their earnings estimates for the current quarter, while three analyst has revised the estimate downward. The net effect has taken our Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current quarter from $2.08 per share to $1.17 in that period.Given the way analysts feel about DaVita right now, this huge implied volatility could mean there’s a trade developing. Oftentimes, options traders look for options with high levels of implied volatility to sell premium. This is a strategy many seasoned traders use because it captures decay. At expiration, the hope for these traders is that the underlying stock does not move as much as originally expected.Looking to Trade Options?Check out the simple yet high-powered approach that Zacks Executive VP Kevin Matras has used to close recent double and triple-digit winners.

229,f53959b2-a223-3a9c-9a03-8f44b0d70e44,VMC,2022-11-12,4 Concrete & Aggregates Stocks to Watch Amid Industry Headwinds,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/4-concrete-aggregates-stocks-watch-135401978.html,1668174841,STORY,"['VMC', 'MLM', 'SUM', 'EXP', '^GSPC']","[Rising raw material costs, housing market slowdown, supply-chain disruptions and higher labor and transportation costs are creating several hurdles for the Zacks Building Products - Concrete &amp; Aggregates industry players. Nonetheless, a boost in infrastructural and public construction spending should continue to act as a major tailwind. Also, an improving non-residential construction market and favorable pricing dynamics have been aiding companies in navigating hard times. Prominent names in the industry, like Vulcan Materials Company VMC, Martin Marietta Materials, Inc. MLM, Eagle Materials Inc. EXP and Summit Materials, Inc. SUM, have been gaining from the positives.Industry DescriptionThe Zacks Building Products - Concrete &amp; Aggregates industry consists of manufacturers, distributors and sellers of construction materials like aggregates and concrete along with other related items for public infrastructure, residential and non-residential, as well as other end markets. The materials also include gypsum wallboard, recycled paperboard, concrete blocks, ready-mix concrete, and oil and gas proppants. The industry players are also involved in designing, engineering, manufacturing, marketing, and installation of external building products for commercial, residential, and repair and remodel markets in domestic as well as international markets.3 Trends Shaping the Future of Concrete &amp; Aggregates IndustryFluctuation in Input Prices, Weather Woes, Residential Slowdown, &amp; Shortage of Skilled Labors: The industry players are struggling with escalating material expenses, the shortage of skilled laborers and rising wage costs. The companies use electricity, diesel fuel, liquid asphalt and other petroleum-based resources. Hence, supply-related woes and significant fluctuations in the prices of these resources affect operating results. Also, the businesses are exposed to weather-related risks that affect production schedules and hence profitability. Excessive rainfall, flooding or severe droughts jeopardize shipments and production. The first and fourth quarters are mostly affected by winter. Again, hurricanes in the Atlantic Ocean and Gulf Coast are most active during these quarters. These impediments may continue to bump up costs and mar the industry participants’ profits. This apart, the recent slowdown in the residential market is causing a downdraft in wallboard, cement and other products of the industry, thereby weighing on the companies’ performance. Notably, rising mortage rates and home prices have been prompting a moderation in housing demand.Focus on Reviving Infrastructure: On Nov 15, 2021, President Joe Biden signed a bipartisan infrastructure bill of $550 billion, in addition to the approved funds of $450 billion for five years in August. Total spending may go up to $1.2 trillion if the plan is extended to eight years. This bill comprises new investments in almost every infrastructure sector over the next five-year period, including transportation, energy, broadband and water. Out of the total allotted spending, the infrastructure development law will provide $100 billion toward roads, bridges and other major projects. It will invest $66 billion in freight and passenger rail, including potential upgrades to Amtrak. The project will allocate $11 billion to reducing car crashes and fatalities through a “Safe Streets for All” program. The Biden administration’s endeavor to pump money for rebuilding the nation's roads, bridges and other infrastructure would give construction companies like Vulcan, Martin Marietta and others a solid foundation for growth.Acquisitions &amp; Focus on Operating Efficiency: The industry participants follow a well-chalked-out acquisition plan to enhance domestic and international portfolios. Moreover, companies are increasingly focusing on reducing controllable costs and maximizing operating efficiency across business lines to generate higher earnings and cash flows. The industry players also have been experiencing a solid pricing environment across their product portfolios, thereby helping to boost margins.Story continuesZacks Industry Rank Indicates Dull ProspectsThe Zacks Building Products - Concrete &amp; Aggregates industry is a nine-stock group within the broader Zacks Construction sector. The industry currently carries a Zacks Industry Rank #179, which places it in the bottom 29% of more than 250 Zacks industries.The group’s Zacks Industry Rank, which is basically the average of the Zacks Rank of all the member stocks, indicates bleak near-term prospects. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperform the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.The industry’s positioning in the bottom 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries is a result of a weak earnings outlook for the constituent companies in aggregate. Looking at the aggregate earnings estimate revisions, it appears that analysts are gradually losing confidence in this group’s bottom-line growth potential. Since October 2022, the industry’s earnings estimates for 2022 and 2023 have been revised 1.2% and 2.1% downward.Despite the industry’s gloomy near-term view, we will present a few stocks that one may consider adding to the portfolio. Before that, it’s worth taking a look at the industry’s shareholder returns and current valuation.Industry Outperforms Sector, Lags S&amp;P 500The Zacks Building Products - Concrete &amp; Aggregates industry has outperformed the broader Zacks Construction sector but lagged the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite over the past year.Stocks in this industry have collectively lost 22.8% versus the broader sector’s decline of 25.4% over the past year. Meanwhile, the S&amp;P 500 has slipped 21.5% in the same period.One-Year Price PerformanceIndustry's Current ValuationOn the basis of the forward 12-month price to earnings, which is a commonly used multiple for valuing Building Products - Concrete &amp; Aggregates stocks, the industry is currently trading at 16.2X versus the S&amp;P 500’s 16.6X and the sector’s 11.8X.Over the past five years, the industry has traded as high as 24.5X, as low as 13.5X and at a median of 19.4X, as the chart below shows.Industry’s P/E Ratio (Forward 12-Month) Versus S&amp;P 5004 Concrete &amp; Aggregates Stocks to Keep a Close Eye OnNone of the stocks in the Zacks Concrete &amp; Aggregates universe currently carries a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy). Below, we have discussed four stocks from the industry that have solid earnings growth potential. The chosen companies currently carry a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).  You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here. Summit Materials: Based in Denver, CO, this is a construction material company. Summit Materials has been witnessing solid pricing growth across all lines of business and expects the trend to continue in 2023. The company has also been optimizing its portfolio as it intends to shift toward a more materials-led portfolio. Meanwhile, the company remains optimistic as it believes public markets are poised to experience robust and durable growth driven by well-funded state budgets and as infrastructure funding begins to flow through. A solid state DOT budgets flow will aid the company, which has been receiving more contracts associated to highways and related works.Summit Materials has gained 26.7% over the past year, underperforming the industry’s 22.8% decline. This Zacks Rank #3 company’s earnings estimates for 2023 are expected to grow 50.9%.Price and Consensus: SUMVulcan Materials Company: This Birmingham, AL-based company produces and supplies construction aggregates, asphalt mix as well as ready-mixed concrete. The company’s focus on four strategic initiatives — Commercial Excellence, Operational Excellence, Strategic Sourcing, and Logistics Innovation — should enhance price performance as well as operating efficiencies. Vulcan Materials has been generating higher earnings despite tepid revenues on the back of prudent cost-control efforts and increased pricing in aggregates. Its focus on a systematic inorganic strategy for expansion is adding to the positives. Overall, improving private non-residential construction, solid infrastructure investment and favorable pricing dynamics have been driving growth.Vulcan currently carries a Zacks Rank #3. The company’s shares have dropped 13.3% over the past year. Earnings for 2023 are expected to grow 26.5%.Price and Consensus: VMCMartin Marietta Materials: Based in Raleigh, NC, Martin Marietta produces and supplies construction aggregates as well as other heavy building materials — mainly cement — in the United States. Expanded infrastructure investment, along with recovering private non-residential markets and heavy industrial projects of scale, are expected to support near-term shipment levels. Also, the Lehigh West Region and Tiller buyouts should enhance its reach in new geographies for persistent industry-leading growth.Martin Marietta currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 and has slipped 17.6% in the past year. Earnings for 2023 are expected to rise 21.7%.Price and Consensus: MLMEagle Materials: This Dallas, TX-based company produces and supplies heavy construction materials, light building materials, and materials used for oil and natural gas extraction in the United States. Improved cement, concrete and aggregates sales volume as well as a solid contribution from the recently acquired Kosmos Cement business are aiding the company’s growth. Higher pricing is adding to the positives.Eagle Materials currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 and has lost 21.5% in the past year. Its earnings estimates for fiscal 2023 have moved 2.9% upward in the past 30 days.

230,4d5a0b66-40ab-37fa-953c-24f8c969a956,GE,2022-11-12,General Electric Company (GE) Is a Trending Stock: Facts to Know Before Betting on It,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/general-electric-company-ge-trending-140002359.html,1668175202,STORY,['GE'],"[General Electric (GE) has been one of the most searched-for stocks on Zacks.com lately. So, you might want to look at some of the facts that could shape the stock's performance in the near term.Over the past month, shares of this industrial conglomerate have returned +25.7%, compared to the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's +9.6% change. During this period, the Zacks Diversified Operations industry, which GE falls in, has gained 13.8%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?Although media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.Revisions to Earnings EstimatesHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.Our analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.GE is expected to post earnings of $1.12 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +21.7%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -4.4%.The consensus earnings estimate of $2.54 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of +19.8%. This estimate has changed -6.5% over the last 30 days.For the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $4.27 indicates a change of +68% from what GE is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -3.6%.Story continuesHaving a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, GE is rated Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPS12-month consensus EPS estimate for GE _12MonthEPSChartUrlProjected Revenue GrowthWhile earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.For GE, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $21.88 billion indicates a year-over-year change of +7.8%. For the current and next fiscal years, $75.86 billion and $81.19 billion estimates indicate +2.3% and +7% changes, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryGE reported revenues of $19.08 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +3.6%. EPS of $0.35 for the same period compares with $0.57 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $19.04 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +0.26%. The EPS surprise was -25.53%.Over the last four quarters, GE surpassed consensus EPS estimates three times. The company topped consensus revenue estimates two times over this period.ValuationWithout considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.Comparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.The Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.GE is graded D on this front, indicating that it is trading at a premium to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.ConclusionThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about GE. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

(NYSE:EL) has been reasonably good and CEO Fabrizio Freda has done a decent job of steering the company in the right direction. As shareholders go into the upcoming AGM on 18 November 2022, CEO compensation will probably not be their focus, but rather the steps management will take to continue the growth momentum. However, some shareholders may still be hesitant of being overly generous with CEO compensation. View our latest analysis for Estée Lauder Companies How Does Total Compensation For Fabrizio Freda Compare With Other Companies In The Industry?At the time of writing, our data shows that The Estée Lauder Companies Inc. has a market capitalization of US$81b, and reported total annual CEO compensation of US$25m for the year to June 2022. We note that's a decrease of 61% compared to last year. While this analysis focuses on total compensation, it's worth acknowledging that the salary portion is lower, valued at US$2.1m.For comparison, other companies in the industry with market capitalizations above US$8.0b, reported a median total CEO compensation of US$3.4m. Hence, we can conclude that Fabrizio Freda is remunerated higher than the industry median. What's more, Fabrizio Freda holds US$31m worth of shares in the company in their own name, indicating that they have a lot of skin in the game.Component20222021Proportion (2022)SalaryUS$2.1mUS$1.7m8%OtherUS$23mUS$64m92%Total CompensationUS$25mUS$66m100%On an industry level, roughly 35% of total compensation represents salary and 65% is other remuneration. Estée Lauder Companies pays a modest slice of remuneration through salary, as compared to the broader industry. If non-salary compensation dominates total pay, it's an indicator that the executive's salary is tied to company performance.ceo-compensationThe Estée Lauder Companies Inc.'s GrowthOver the past three years, The Estée Lauder Companies Inc. has seen its earnings per share (EPS) grow by 5.7% per year. In the last year, its revenue is up 1.3%.Story continuesWe're not particularly impressed by the revenue growth, but it is good to see modest EPS growth. Considering these factors we'd say performance has been pretty decent, though not amazing. Looking ahead, you might want to check this free visual report on analyst forecasts for the company's future earnings..Has The Estée Lauder Companies Inc. Been A Good Investment?The Estée Lauder Companies Inc. has served shareholders reasonably well, with a total return of 22% over three years. But they probably wouldn't be so happy as to think the CEO should be paid more than is normal, for companies around this size.In Summary...Seeing that the company has put up a decent performance, only a few shareholders, if any at all, might have questions about the CEO pay in the upcoming AGM. Still, not all shareholders might be in favor of a pay raise to the CEO, seeing that they are already being paid higher than the industry.CEO compensation can have a massive impact on performance, but it's just one element.

Selling at an average price of US$150, which is higher than the current price, may have been the best move for these insiders because their investment would have been worth less now than when they sold.While insider transactions are not the most important thing when it comes to long-term investing, we would consider it foolish to ignore insider transactions altogether. See our latest analysis for Procter &amp; Gamble The Last 12 Months Of Insider Transactions At Procter &amp; GambleIn the last twelve months, the biggest single sale by an insider was when the President, Jon Moeller, sold US$4.5m worth of shares at a price of US$149 per share. So we know that an insider sold shares at around the present share price of US$141. While we don't usually like to see insider selling, it's more concerning if the sales take place at a lower price. In this case, the big sale took place at around the current price, so it's not too bad (but it's still not a positive).Insiders in Procter &amp; Gamble didn't buy any shares in the last year. The chart below shows insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last year. If you want to know exactly who sold, for how much, and when, simply click on the graph below!insider-trading-volumeIf you like to buy stocks that insiders are buying, rather than selling, then you might just love this free list of companies. (Hint: insiders have been buying them).Procter &amp; Gamble Insiders Are Selling The StockOver the last three months, we've seen significant insider selling at Procter &amp; Gamble. Specifically, insiders ditched US$25m worth of shares in that time, and we didn't record any purchases whatsoever. This may suggest that some insiders think that the shares are not cheap.Does Procter &amp; Gamble Boast High Insider Ownership?Another way to test the alignment between the leaders of a company and other shareholders is to look at how many shares they own. A high insider ownership often makes company leadership more mindful of shareholder interests. Procter &amp; Gamble insiders own 0.07% of the company, currently worth about US$232m based on the recent share price. Most shareholders would be happy to see this sort of insider ownership, since it suggests that management incentives are well aligned with other shareholders.Story continuesSo What Do The Procter &amp; Gamble Insider Transactions Indicate?Insiders sold Procter &amp; Gamble shares recently, but they didn't buy any. And even if we look at the last year, we didn't see any purchases. But since Procter &amp; Gamble is profitable and growing, we're not too worried by this. The company boasts high insider ownership, but we're a little hesitant, given the history of share sales. While we like knowing what's going on with the insider's ownership and transactions, we make sure to also consider what risks are facing a stock before making any investment decision. You'd be interested to know, that we found 2 warning signs for Procter &amp; Gamble and we suggest you have a look.Of course, you might find a fantastic investment by looking elsewhere.

The barriers to entry in the regulated waste collection and disposal business are very high. In addition to stiff competition from large national companies, many small, regional and local companies compete aggressively in terms of pricing.

248,7e37ce5f-61f3-332c-840d-bb8a512f9fab,ORLY,2022-11-12,October CPI Data Raises Hope for a Soft Landing: 5 Top Picks,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/october-cpi-data-raises-hope-125912688.html,1668171552,STORY,"['MCK', 'HUM', 'CAT', 'MPC', 'COMP', '^GSPC', '^RUT', 'ORLY']","[Nov 10 ushered in a silver lining for Wall Street behind the dark clouds seen in 2022. The Bureau of Labor Statistics reported that the consumer price index (CPI) for October came lighter than market’s expectation, and U.S. stock markets shot up on the belief that the peak of inflation is behind us.October’s CPI data has significantly strengthened the ongoing Wall Street rally that started last month and paved the way for a year-end rally too. Historically, the last two months of any year have been favorable for investors. Moreover, the global financial market is abuzz  with a rumor that China may reopen from COVID-19 restrictions.Therefore, the stage has been set for a bull run unless any external shock like a geopolitical conflict creates a hurdle. To gain from this ongoing rally, we have selected five U.S. corporate giants with a favorable Zacks Rank and strong business potential for the rest of 2022. These are — Caterpillar Inc. CAT, McKesson Corp. MCK, Marathon Petroleum Corp. MPC, O'Reilly Automotive Inc. ORLY and Humana Inc. HUM.Inflation Seems to be DwindlingThe Department of Labor reported that CPI in October rose 0.4% month over month and 7.7% year over year. The consensus estimate was 0.5% for the month-over-month rise and 7.9% for the year-over-year gain. Core CPI (excluding volatile food and energy items) increased 0.3% month over month and 6.3% year over year. The consensus estimate was of a rise of 0.5% month over month and 6.5% year over year.The decline in CPI and core CPI may be marginal but peak inflation seems behind us. In fact, economic indicators like a tepid housing sector, declining commodity prices (except food and energy), growing accumulation of inventories on the part of manufacturers and retailers, gradual slowdown of the ISM manufacturing PMI and a decline in the job openings rate were pointing to the cooling down of the U.S. economy.Consequently, the three major stock indexes  — the Dow, the S&amp;P 500 and the Nasdaq Composite — rallied 3.7%, 5.5% and 7.4%, respectively, marking their best single-day performance in more than 30 months. The small-cap benchmark — the Russell 2000 — also surged 6.1%.Story continuesCan Fed Delivers a Soft Landing?After the release of the October CPI data, the CME FedWatch shows that there exists an 80.6% probability, against a 56.8% probability just a day ago that the Fed will raise the benchmark lending rate by 50 basis points in December.The ICE U.S. Dollar Index (DXY), which measures the greenback’s strength against a basket of six major currencies, fell 2.4% to 107.85 from 113 in Nov 3. The index soared to its 20-year high of 114.24 in Sep 27. Global financial markets were rattled by a skyrocketing dollar. The yield on the benchmark 10-Year U.S. Treasury Note dropped 33 basis points to 3.828%. The interest-rate-sensitive yield on the short-term 2-Year U.S. Treasury Note fell 30 basis points to 4.32%. Investors were highly concerned about an imminent recession due to the soaring risk-free market rate.Moreover, U.S. GDP has grown 2.6% in the third quarter, beating the consensus estimate of 2.2%. Market participants were worried that the economy might enter into a recession after it contracted in the first two quarters of this year.The labor market is currently at the pre-pandemic level with an unemployment rate of 3.7%. Finally, despite several major headwinds, the overall management guidance in the third-quarter 2022 earnings season was fairly good.Therefore, a strong U.S. economy and slowing inflation may enable the Fed to perform the herculean task of a soft landing of the economy.Our Top PicksWe have narrowed our search to five U.S. corporate behemoths with solid growth potential. These companies have seen positive earnings estimate revision in the last seven days indicating that the market is expecting them to do robust business in the near term. Each of our picks carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.The chart below shows the price performance of our five picks in the past three months.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchMarathon Petroleum is poised for further price gains based on a slew of positives. MPC’s $21 billion sales of its Speedway retail business provided it with a much-needed cash infusion. The deal also comes with a 15-year fuel-supply agreement under which Marathon Petroleum will supply 7.7 billion gallons of gasoline per year to 7-Eleven, thus ensuring a steady revenue stream.MPC’s exposure to more stable cash flows from the logistics segment diversifies the earnings stream and offers a buffer against the volatile refining business. Consequently, Marathon Petroleum is primed for significant capital appreciation and is viewed as a preferred downstream operator to own now.Marathon Petroleum has an expected earnings growth rate of more than 100% for the current year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings has improved 1.4% over the last seven days.McKesson provides pharmaceuticals and medical supplies in the United States and internationally. The strong fiscal first-quarter show by three of the four segments of MCK is encouraging. A strong earnings outlook for fiscal 2023 instill optimism.Strong adjusted operating profit growth across the key segments of MCK is encouraging. A strong position in the Distribution market continues to favor the stock. McKesson played a crucial role in the COVID-19 response efforts in the United States and abroad via the distribution of COVID-19 vaccines, ancillary supply kits, and COVID-19 tests.McKesson has an expected earnings growth rate of 4.5% for the current year (ending March 2023). The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings has improved 0.6% over the last seven days.Humana’s Medicaid business, buoyed by several contract wins and renewals, has been strongly contributing to its top line for years. Buyouts and alliances place HUM well for growth. Humana has been deploying excess capital for several years on balance sheet strength. HUM’s solid contributions from the Retail and Healthcare Services units are its major positives.Humana has an expected earnings growth rate of 21.3% for the current year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings has improved 0.1% over the last seven days.Caterpillar’s revenues and earnings grew year over year for six straight quarters thanks to its cost-saving actions, strong end-market demand and pricing actions that offset the impact of the ongoing supply chain snarls and cost pressures. We expect CAT’s adjusted earnings per share for 2022 to grow 11.6%, while revenues are predicted to rise 11.2%. The Construction Industries segment is expected to benefit from the rising construction activities in the United States and other parts of the world.Backed by demand for commodities fueled by the energy-transition trend, a thriving mining sector will aid the Resource Industries segment. CAT’s dividend yield and payout ratio are higher than its peers. A strong liquidity position, investments in expanding services and digital initiatives will help Caterpillar deliver outsized returns.Caterpillar has an expected earnings growth rate of 24.8% for the current year.

The ex-dividend date is one business day before a company's record date, which is the date on which the company determines which shareholders are entitled to receive a dividend. The ex-dividend date is of consequence because whenever a stock is bought or sold, the trade takes at least two business day to settle. Therefore, if you purchase Sherwin-Williams' shares on or after the 17th of November, you won't be eligible to receive the dividend, when it is paid on the 2nd of December.The company's next dividend payment will be US$0.60 per share, and in the last 12 months, the company paid a total of US$2.40 per share. Based on the last year's worth of payments, Sherwin-Williams has a trailing yield of 1.0% on the current stock price of $237.24. If you buy this business for its dividend, you should have an idea of whether Sherwin-Williams's dividend is reliable and sustainable. So we need to investigate whether Sherwin-Williams can afford its dividend, and if the dividend could grow. Check out our latest analysis for Sherwin-Williams If a company pays out more in dividends than it earned, then the dividend might become unsustainable - hardly an ideal situation. Fortunately Sherwin-Williams's payout ratio is modest, at just 31% of profit. Yet cash flows are even more important than profits for assessing a dividend, so we need to see if the company generated enough cash to pay its distribution. Dividends consumed 65% of the company's free cash flow last year, which is within a normal range for most dividend-paying organisations.It's positive to see that Sherwin-Williams's dividend is covered by both profits and cash flow, since this is generally a sign that the dividend is sustainable, and a lower payout ratio usually suggests a greater margin of safety before the dividend gets cut.Story continuesClick here to see the company's payout ratio, plus analyst estimates of its future dividends.historic-dividendHave Earnings And Dividends Been Growing?Companies with consistently growing earnings per share generally make the best dividend stocks, as they usually find it easier to grow dividends per share. Investors love dividends, so if earnings fall and the dividend is reduced, expect a stock to be sold off heavily at the same time. Fortunately for readers, Sherwin-Williams's earnings per share have been growing at 13% a year for the past five years. Sherwin-Williams is paying out a bit over half its earnings, which suggests the company is striking a balance between reinvesting in growth, and paying dividends. This is a reasonable combination that could hint at some further dividend increases in the future.Many investors will assess a company's dividend performance by evaluating how much the dividend payments have changed over time. In the last 10 years, Sherwin-Williams has lifted its dividend by approximately 17% a year on average. It's great to see earnings per share growing rapidly over several years, and dividends per share growing right along with it.To Sum It UpShould investors buy Sherwin-Williams for the upcoming dividend? Earnings per share have grown at a nice rate in recent times and over the last year, Sherwin-Williams paid out less than half its earnings and a bit over half its free cash flow. Sherwin-Williams looks solid on this analysis overall, and we'd definitely consider investigating it more closely.In light of that, while Sherwin-Williams has an appealing dividend, it's worth knowing the risks involved with this stock.

The stock market has reported negative returns for three consecutive quarters this year for the first time since the global financial crisis of 2009, according to a report by New York Times. The report also mentioned that the S&amp;P 500 ended the quarter with an over 5% decline, which has pushed investors towards defensive stocks. In this regard, dividend stocks like Merck &amp; Co., Inc. (NYSE:MRK), AbbVie Inc. (NYSE:ABBV), and Chevron Corporation (NYSE:CVX) are gaining ground among investors.Historically, dividend stocks have delivered strong returns in previous inflationary periods. Moreover, quality dividend companies have also raised their payouts steadily over the past years regardless of economic conditions. In the past 15 years ending August 2022, the average dividend growth rate stood at 13.71%, compared with a 2.21% growth in the Consumer Price Index (CPI) during the same period, according to S&amp;P Global. The report also highlighted that dividends now represent 6.25% of an income source, growing from 2.88% in 1981.Another report by Sterling Capital mentioned that dividend growers outperformed their peers when inflation ranged between 4% to 13% annually over the past five decades. Analysts recommend dividend stocks due to the compounding effects of dividend income and price appreciation. Over the past 30 years ending December 2021, reinvested dividends for the S&amp;P 500 represented nearly 50% of the total equity market, according to iShares. In view of this, we will discuss consistent dividend stocks in this article.15 Best Consistent Dividend Stocks to BuyImage by Sergei Tokmakov Terms.Law from PixabayOur Methodology:Story continuesFor this list, we selected dividend stocks that have strong dividend histories.

Core EPS also increased 10.1% year over year.

The company’s reported EPS of $1.95 declined 22% year over year in the quarter. Adverse currency rates impacted EPS by 3% in the quarter.Net revenues of $21,971 million improved 8.8% year over year and surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $20,878 million and our estimate of $20,735.1 million.

Foreign currency impacted revenues by 3%.On an organic basis, revenues grew 16% year over year, driven by broad-based growth across categories and geographies. This marked the fourth straight quarter of double-digit organic revenue growth for the company. Consolidated organic volume was down 1%, while effective net pricing improved 17% in the third quarter. Pricing gains were driven by strong realized prices across all segments.Improvements across categories resulted from accelerated growth in the global beverage and convenient food businesses, reflecting strength in its diversified portfolio.

Core operating income rose 10.9% year over year to $3,595 million and core constant-currency operating income improved 14%. The reported operating margin declined 30 bps to 15.3% from 15.6% in the year-ago quarter due to higher SG&amp;A expenses and pre-tax impairment charges related to intangible assets, offset by gains from the Juice transaction. Meanwhile, the core operating margin expanded 30 bps, driven by strong revenue growth and gains from cost-management initiatives, offset by inflationary pressures on operating expenses.Story continuesSegmental DetailsThe company witnessed revenue growth across all segments. Organic revenues climbed for all segments. Revenues, on a reported basis, improved 20% in FLNA, 15% in QFNA, 4% in PBNA, 20% in Latin America, 1% in Europe, 4% in AMESA and 3% in APAC.

Earlier, the company had anticipated a 2-percentage-point impact from currency headwinds. The company continues to expect a core effective tax rate of 20%.Based on the above assumption, PepsiCo expects its core earnings per share to be $6.73 for 2022 compared with the $6.63 mentioned earlier.

Increasing monthly active users and improving engagement reflected by growing total time spent are expected to have aided Shopee in the to-be-reported quarter.Additionally, SeaMoney’s strengthening integration with Shopee is expected to have aided Sea’s digital financial services business.Higher expenses related to the expansion of e-commerce services and continued efforts to integrate Sea Limited’s mobile wallet services with the Shopee platform across different markets are expected to have negatively impacted profitability in the to-be-reported quarter.What Our Model IndicatesPer the Zacks model, the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) increases the odds of an earnings beat.

Price and EPS SurpriseSonos, Inc. Price and EPS SurpriseSonos, Inc. price-eps-surprise | Sonos, Inc. QuoteFactors at PlaySofter consumer demand owing to the weakness prevailing over global macroeconomic conditions and rising inflation are likely to have affected Sonos’ fourth-quarter performance. Unfavorable forex movement and lingering supply chain issues resulting in increased component costs are likely to have been other headwinds.Shifting consumer spending patterns has been compelling retail partners to right-size their inventory positions, which is likely to have negatively impacted Sonos’ performance.In the last reported quarter, the company slashed its 2022 outlook owing to the abovementioned factors. Sonos now expects revenues to increase 1-2% year over year in the range of $1.73-$1.755 billion. Earlier the company expected revenues to increase 14-16% year over year in the range of $1.95-$2 billion.Nonetheless, higher selling price is expected to have provided some cushioning to the fiscal fourth quarter performance. The company has been focused on its three strategic initiatives — expanding its brand, boosting its offerings and driving operational excellence.New product launches are likely to act as a tailwind. In September, Sonos announced the launch of its new speaker, Sub Mini, to further expand its home theater product line. The speaker is priced at $429. The Sub Mini features an acoustically sealed cabinet with woofers facing inward that creates a force-canceling effect, which reduces distortion and provides its users with an immersive audio experience. It can also be paired with the company’s existing line of home theater products like Beam or Ray.Steady traction witnessed for products such as Beam Gen 2, Roam, Ray, Arc, as well as partnerships with companies like Audi and IKEA is likely to have aided the company in the quarter under review.Story continuesEarnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively predict an earnings beat for Sonos this time around.
