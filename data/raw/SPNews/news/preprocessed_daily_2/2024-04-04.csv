In the initial period the company may have a higher growth rate and the second stage is usually assumed to have a stable growth rate. In the first stage we need to estimate the cash flows to the business over the next ten years. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years."", 'A DCF is all about the idea that a dollar in the future is less valuable than a dollar today, so we need to discount the sum of these future cash flows to arrive at a present value estimate:', '2024', '2025', '2026', '2027', '2028', '2029', '2030', '2031', '2032', '2033', ' Levered FCF ($, Millions) ', 'US$945.9m', 'US$1.08b', 'US$1.27b', 'US$1.46b', 'US$1.61b', 'US$1.72b', 'US$1.82b', 'US$1.91b', 'US$1.98b', 'US$2.05b', 'Growth Rate Estimate Source', 'Analyst x4', 'Analyst x4', 'Analyst x3', 'Analyst x1', 'Analyst x1', 'Est @ 7.10%', 'Est @ 5.66%', 'Est @ 4.65%', 'Est @ 3.94%', 'Est @ 3.44%', ' Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 6.5% ', 'US$888', 'US$953', 'US$1.1k', 'US$1.1k', 'US$1.2k', 'US$1.2k', 'US$1.2k', 'US$1.2k', 'US$1.1k', 'US$1.1k', '(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$11b', ""We now need to calculate the Terminal Value, which accounts for all the future cash flows after this ten year period.

The first is the discount rate and the other is the cash flows. You don't have to agree with these inputs, I recommend redoing the calculations yourself and playing with them. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Verisk Analytics as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 6.5%, which is based on a levered beta of 0.907. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business."", 'Strength', 'Debt is well covered by earnings and cashflows.', 'Weakness', 'Earnings declined over the past year.', 'Dividend is low compared to the top 25% of dividend payers in the Professional Services market.', 'Opportunity', 'Annual earnings are forecast to grow for the next 3 years.', 'Current share price is below our estimate of fair value.', 'Threat', 'Annual earnings are forecast to grow slower than the American market.', ""Although the valuation of a company is important, it ideally won't be the sole piece of analysis you scrutinize for a company.

Thank you for your interest in Acuity brands. I will now turn the call over to Neil Ashe."", 'Neil M. Ashe', 'Thank you, Charlotte, and thank you all for joining us this morning. Our fiscal 2024 second quarter was another quarter of solid execution. We increased our adjusted operating profit, adjusted operating profit margin and adjusted diluted earnings per share. We generated strong free cash flow, and we allocated capital effectively to drive value. Both our Lighting and our Intelligence Spaces businesses delivered strong financial performance. In ABL, we increased adjusted operating profit by $3 million on $47 million less sales and increased the adjusted operating profit margin 120 basis points to 16.2%. This performance is the cumulative result of the changes that we have made to the business over the last 4 years. We have made the business more predictable, repeatable and scalable by executing on our strategy to increase product vitality, elevate service levels, use technology to improve and differentiate both our products and how we operate the business and by driving productivity. During the second quarter, we continue to make progress on our strategy. By focusing on the needs of our customers, we are elevating our service through our differentiated portfolios. Contractor Select is about 300 of our most popular products that are used in common everyday lighting applications. These products are designed to be resold and are in stock at retailers and electrical distributors. Through high levels of product vitality, we have been able to create a portfolio that offers quality products that our customers want at competitive prices, while at the same time, allowing our distributor partners to carry less inventory. Design Select is comprised of products that are configurable and allow customers to easily select the products needed for their projects. We are less than a year into launching the first wave of Design Select, and we are continuing to expand the product families and configurations available. The reception so far has been positive. A recent project in California is a great example, where a customer needed indoor fixtures, outdoor fixtures and lighting controls. Using options from the Design Select portfolio, we were able to meet the unique product combination of the project, ensure it was there when the customer needed it, and then it was easy for the contractor to install. The remainder of our product portfolio is Made-to-Order. These are specialty products or solutions made for specific applications, such as national accounts that satisfy all of the wants and needs of the Lyon Design community. At the same time, we continue to make investments for future growth. In the second quarter, we expanded our horticulture product solutions. We added the Arize family of products to our existing Verjure line in order to take advantage of a growing market. Arize is a collection of professional grade LED horticulture luminaires, that are compatible with our in-line air wireless controls and are used in commercial greenhouses, indoor cultivation and vertical farming. This small investment accelerates our product portfolio efforts in this attractive vertical. This approach to investment in ABL is the right one, as evidenced by the value being realized in our OPTOTRONIC driver and component business. We acquired OPTOTRONIC in 2021 in order to control more of the technology in our luminaires, to expand our OEM channel and to take greater control of our electronic supply chain. Today, we are one of the top driver suppliers to the lighting industry and to ourselves as we manufacture the majority of our drivers for our own products. This control not only offers us a financial benefit but also offers us greater engineering flexibility during the design and development process that is core to our product vitality efforts. This quarter, we introduced the IVO family of shallow recessed downlights from Gotham which is a new platform of vendor downlights that have compact design for use in confined spaces that replace the traditional canned recess lighting fixtures.IVO can be used in most nonresidential settings in both new construction and renovation. The Compact Design and high efficiency options deliver real value for our customers, while the use of less steel, less aluminum and less plastic drives margin for us. Finally, this quarter, several of our brands were recognized by the industry. Our Aculux, Eureka, Hydrel, Luminis and Peerless brands were awarded 9 good design awards from the Chicago Atemi Use of architecture and design. We were awarded 11, 2023 product innovation awards by Architectural Products Magazine for impressive innovation in terms of form, functionality and sustainability. And 14 of our luminaires were selected across multiple product categories by the LIT Design Award for exemplifying outstanding creativity and innovation. Now moving to our Intelligence Spaces Group. Our mission in our Intelligence Spaces business is to make spaces smarter, safer and greener through our strategy of connecting the edge to the cloud. Distech has the best edge control devices on the market, while Atrius will be the best in cloud applications. At Distech, we are focused on expanding our addressable market in 2 ways. The first is geographic and the second is increasing what we can control in a built space. As part of our geographic expansion, this quarter we added additional systems integrator capacity in Australia, and we released Atrius Sustainability and Atrius Energy in France. Our independent SIs are key to the organic expansion of our Spaces business. We partner with the best SIs in specific geographies to sell our full suite of Distech and Atrius product portfolios. Our Atrius applications are making a difference for our customers. Atrius sustainability is an automation tool that captures, categorizes and reports on carbon emissions, while Atrius Energy facilitates the reduction of energy and carbon usage by allowing facilities teams to benchmark their usage and prepare for upcoming reporting obligations. Our Atrius energy and sustainability applications are gaining recognition. Commercial Property Executive magazine named Atrius, an innovative technology winner in its annual influence awards. And CREtech selected Atrius as a finalist in its real estate tech awards that on our technology vendors that are advancing solutions for commercial buildings. Now turning to the outlook for the remainder of the year. We are performing well. We are satisfying customers, expanding margins and generating strong free cash flow. The order rates in both our Lighting business and our Spaces business are growing year-over-year. In our Lighting business, we are back to typical lead times and absent the impact of sales from excess backlog last year, we would be experiencing sales growth. In our Lighting and Lighting Controls business, our strategy drives strong execution, and we are focused on returning the business to growth in a normalized environment, while leveraging our fixed costs and generating strong cash flow. In our Spaces business, we will continue to grow geographically and by adding to what we can control in a build space. Karen will outline what that means for our second half outlook after giving you an update on our second quarter performance. Karen?', 'Karen J. Holcom', ""Thank you, Neil, and good morning to everyone on the call. As Neil said, we continue to execute well. In our fiscal second quarter, we increased our adjusted operating profit, improved our adjusted operating profit margin and increased our adjusted diluted earnings per share while generating strong cash flow. We continue to allocate capital effectively while making progress on our strategic priorities. For total AYI, we generated net sales in the second quarter of $906 million, which was $38 million or 4% lower than the prior year as a result of the lower net sales in our ABL business. This was partially offset by continued growth in the ISG business of 17% in the quarter. We continue to deliver year-over-year margin improvement. During the quarter, our adjusted operating profit increased by $8 million on lower net sales, and we expanded adjusted operating profit margin to 15.5%, an increase of approximately 150 basis points from the prior year. This increase was driven largely by the significant year-over-year improvement in our gross profit margin as we continue to execute our strategy and drive margins through product vitality, the management of price and cost and productivity improvements. During the quarter, our adjusted diluted earnings per share of $3.38 increased $0.32 or 11% over the prior year, primarily a result of higher net income and to a lesser extent, lower shares outstanding due to share repurchases. In ABL, net sales were $844 million in the quarter. A decrease of around 5% compared with the prior year, driven by declines across all of our channels. As Neil mentioned previously, our order rate in ABL continues to grow year-over-year, meaning absent the sales last year from the excess backlog, ABL would have experienced sales growth. ABL's adjusted operating profit increased 2% to $136 million on lower net sales while we delivered adjusted operating profit margin of 16.2%, a 120 basis point improvement over the prior year. ISG's net sales for the second quarter were $68 million, an increase of 17% as Distech continued to grow and Q2 term performed as we expected. ISG's adjusted operating profit was $14 million with the adjusted operating profit margin at 21%, a 240 basis point improvement over the prior year. Now turning to our year-to-date cash flow performance. We generated $293 million of cash flow from operating activities in the first half of the year, down slightly from the same period last year. We continue to allocate capital consistent with our priorities. Year-to-date, we invested $29 million in capital expenditures. We acquired the assets of Arize horticulture lighting, we increased our dividend per share 15% and allocated approximately $68 million to repurchase over 370,000 shares. In January, our Board of Directors authorized the additional repurchase of up to 3 million shares of common stock, bringing the outstanding authorization to approximately 4 million shares. Since the beginning of the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020, we have repurchased approximately 9.5 million shares at an average price of about $145 per share, which was funded by organic cash flow. This amounts to about 24% of the then shares outstanding. We had a strong first half performance. We delivered improved margins and increased adjusted diluted earnings per share. We generated strong cash flow from operations and continued to allocate capital effectively. While it is not our practice to address our outlook during the year, our performance in the first half was very strong and we are raising our full year expectations for EPS. We now expect our 2024 adjusted diluted earnings per share range to be between $14.75 and $15.50. Thank you for joining us today. I will now pass you over to the operator to take your questions."", 'Operator', ""(Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from the line of Joe O'Dea with Wells Fargo."", ""Joseph John O'Dea"", ""So first question, I'll group kind of 2 in 1, but I wanted to ask about infrastructure and SG&A. And really, the angle is, are you seeing evidence that some of the changes in the commissions that you implemented last year are translating to better wins at this point? You can talk about the infrastructure pipeline a little bit. As well as just when you see where SG&A is as a percent of sales, opportunities that you see there, either volume leverage or cost down?"", 'Neil M. Ashe', ""Okay. Great. Joe, thank you. So first of all, on infrastructure, we're feeling good about our positioning for the larger projects that are coming down the pipe. I think everyone is recognizing that they are coming down on a longer-term basis than anyone would like. We'd like them to be here today, but orders are strong, but shipments and sales will be spread out over the next year or 2. So there will be a continued impact from infrastructure and we're confident we'll get at least our fair share, and we're working to get a disproportionate share. So we feel like that's a good opportunity for us going forward. We also feel, to your question, we positioned ourselves well from an execution perspective. So first, around products for -- that are necessary to win those projects. And then the combination and the interrelationship between our direct sales network and our independent sales network as we approach those. So we feel good about those. As it relates to specific SG&A spending, obviously, we're in a position this year where we are -- our performance is -- appears different than it would normally and the reason for that is the excess sales from backlog in last year. So we're confident that, #1, we'll return the lighting business to growth. And that #2, when we do that, the combination of the increased margin performance we've demonstrated at the gross margin level, as well as our ability to leverage SG&A costs going forward will continue to expand margins in that business. So it's not insignificant achievement to expand margins on lower sales, obviously. And so we're looking forward to that business being -- returning to normalized growth."", ""Joseph John O'Dea"", ""I appreciate it. And then also just wanted to touch on cash and deployment. The cash balance at this point is approaching $600 million. And how you're thinking about sort of repurchase activity, any revisions to that within the guidance framework as well as with the higher cash balance, just what we should interpret within that and perhaps strength of the M&A kind of pipeline if you're seeing more opportunities out there?"", 'Karen J. Holcom', ""Yes, Joe, thanks for that. Overall, we are really pleased with our cash flow performance this quarter or this year-to-date period, we've generated $263 million of free cash flow. So really strong cash flow performance. It's driven a lot by our margin performance, which is contributing to the higher net income versus -- despite the lower sales. So overall, really pleased with that. When we look at our capital allocation priorities, we've been really clear over time that it's first to invest in the business for growth, second to invest in M&A, which we've done. Over the past few years, we've made some small but -- relatively small but strategic acquisitions with OPTOTRONIC with KE2 Therm and now with the Arize horticulture assets. So really pleased with the progress we've made there. Maybe you noticed we did increase our dividend by 15% this quarter. So excited to see that increase. And then finally, share repurchases. We've demonstrated when the share price is high, we buy less and when the share price is low, we buy a lot more. So this quarter, we've repurchased cumulative 24% of our shares outstanding. And this year-to-date period, it's been at about $180 a share. So feel really good about where we are from our capital allocation priorities."", 'Neil M. Ashe', ""Karen, I'll build on that just for a second. So we feel really good about the -- our ability to generate value through capital allocation. So first, on the M&A pipeline, we -- our focus continues to be on expanding the Intelligence Spaces group. We have a good pipeline of both small, medium and large-sized acquisitions. As Karen mentioned, we've done really well with the acquisitions that we've Made-to-Order, and we're patient. So we don't feel an obligation to move until we find the right opportunity that is going to have the right impact at the right valuation. Second, as Karen mentioned, we increased the dividend. We did that because we can. We can continue to -- we can afford to pay the dividend at a higher rate and achieve the strategic opportunities that we perceive. And finally, we've demonstrated on our repurchase almost 1/4 of the company at very attractive prices. As Karen mentioned, that when the stock price is lower, we'll buy more and when the stock price is less, we'll buy higher. So when you put it all back together, we view capital allocation as a strategic lever for us to generate value, and we feel really good about our progress on that so far."", 'Operator', 'Our next question comes from the line of Ryan Merkel with William Blair.', 'Ryan James Merkel', 'I wanted to ask first on the new ETS guide. What does it assume for sales for the full year? Neil, you mentioned orders are growing and you expect to return the Lighting business to grow in the second half. Can you just talk about that a little bit more?', 'Neil M. Ashe', ""Sure. I -- so first of all, we're really pleased with our performance so far this year. It's -- as you know, it's not our practice to address guidance other than in the beginning of the year. It's our preference to define an outlook at the beginning of the year and then to execute against it.Our first quarter performance, obviously that was really strong, largely driven by the margin performance. As we look forward for the remainder of the year, we -- obviously, we planned conservatively, given all of the uncertainties going on in the world. So we were appropriately conservative in our plan, and we're adjusting our performance as we perform for the rest of the year. The Lighting business will perform as we expect going forward, I would extend that line to be more than just the back half of the year, but as we return that to growth over a normalized period. So the rest of this year, next year, and beyond. So we feel really good about how we're going to do that as well. It will take a minute for us to continue to work through kind of the inflated sales from last year. But when you look at the performance over a longer period of time on a multiyear stack or where we are in the lighting business, we feel really good about that. So we did not change the revenue guidance. So we feel confident we're within that range, and we're really pleased with our performance from a profitability perspective."", 'Ryan James Merkel', 'Got it. All right. And then I wanted to ask on ISG, really nice growth. Just high level, are you seeing a lot more interest in controls? And are there any drivers of that, that may be new?', 'Neil M. Ashe', ""Yes. So thanks for that question, and I'm going to use it as an opportunity to kind of explain 2 things, if you'll allow me, Ryan. First is that we have a very strong Controls business in the Lighting business. So Acuity Brands Lighting is one of the largest, if not the largest control player for Lighting Controls, specifically. And Distech is OEM provider to Acuity Brands Lighting for those controls. Specifically, now as it relates to our performance on ISG, we feel really good about our strategy there of growth.We're expanding the addressable market for Distech and we're seeing disproportionate demand there for 2 reasons. One is, I think it's fair to say our controls in sensors at Distech are perceived to be the highest quality in the marketplace. So they're very attractive to building owners and facilities managers because it gives them more flexibility than many other solutions. So they have -- because they're open protocol, and because we have open SI distribution, they have the opportunity to be confident that, that investment will carry them forward in an attractive way.We also feel really good about our ability to add more things that we can control, so KE2 Therm is a great example where we acquired effectively products which fit into the Distech portfolio, work within the broader Distech ecosystem and open up additional verticals like retail, convenience stores, et cetera, that have high refrigeration needs. So we feel good about that strategy going forward. So Distech has been taking share in each of the markets which it competes in and now we have the opportunity to expand the market i competes in, #1, and expand the number of things that it controls.And then finally, when you connect the edge to the cloud, which is the Atrius data layer that we have been building, it allows us to take the data that all of those sensors and controls generate and present it to the cloud in a manner in which applications can be built, which make a difference in those build spaces. So we feel really good about the business that we're building there. We think we're building a really valuable technology business."", 'Operator', 'Our next question comes from the line of Christopher Glynn with Oppenheimer & Company.', 'Christopher D. Glynn', 'I wanted to dive into some of the implications for Contractor Select and Design Select. That manner of product management or categorization internally, would you consider that the backbone of your productivity momentum?', 'Neil M. Ashe', ""I think it's a big part of it, Chris. So -- and to spend just another minute on Contractor Select. So our strategy with Contractor Select is to make it the brand of choice for retail and electrical distribution with high product vitality at appropriate prices with high service levels, largely for distributors. And as I mentioned, it's built to be stocked and resold. So designed to be stocked and resold. And we -- it's a very constrained number of SKUs. The -- what that's allowed us to do is to build a very consistent relationship with the distribution and retail community. And what that has done is provided us with a foundation and easy for them to choose. And it's worth noting that there's a lot in it for them, too, because we've created a portfolio that allows them to have less inventory on hand and satisfy the needs of their customers at an appropriate price, they're able to drive significantly higher returns on investment in the execution of their business.So at the same margins, they're making significantly more money as a result. So yes, it's been a really important part of that product portfolio. The second thing is we've raised the margin portfolio of that -- we've raised the margin of that portfolio, excuse me, to much more consistent levels with where we are now. So that's driven some of our margin performance.With Design Select, we're really just getting started. So where Contractor Select is designed to be resold, contract -- or Design Select is designed such that options can be chosen so that you can -- a specifier has the opportunity to choose from options to configure the products and the projects that they need. As we mentioned in the script, we're at the early days of this. So this will be a multiyear process, but it is changing how both specifiers think about our portfolio and how we think about the execution of that portfolio. The majority of our business though remains Made-to-Order. And so that Made-to-Order -- its Made-to-Order made to order for a reason, so the specifiers can make the choices that they need so that they can satisfy large projects, we can satisfy national accounts, we can -- there are a lot of different pieces of that puzzle. We asked -- Joe asked about infrastructure earlier. We won the relight of the city of Philadelphia. That's a good example of a made-to-order project. We made some changes to our product portfolio to satisfy some of their specific needs, and we can roll those out. So when you take those altogether, then we're -- everything is operating at a higher margin profile and it's set and it's doing a much better job of satisfying very specific end user needs in the marketplace."", 'Christopher D. Glynn', ""The extension of that question, you've talked a lot about ability to choose and select the projects you want to be on considering all the productivity you're generating that you just elaborated on. Do you see consistent widening of the aperture moving ahead in terms of what's attractive to you to select within the overall lighting market?"", 'Neil M. Ashe', ""Well, we feel very good about how we're positioned competitively. So we -- obviously, we pay close attention to our competitors to the -- and we generally think about this from a windshield perspective as you indicated, like which projects we want to select. So we're obviously competitive on the Contractor Select side. We're doing really well there. We've been competitive on the project side. So there are a handful of examples where we've passed on projects because we don't like the margin profile, and we're happy for our competitors to execute on those at a lower margin profile, and especially given that their margin profiles are already lower than ours.So when we do not select those projects, that means someone else has selected those projects, and they're executing them at a lower margin than we have and at a lower margin than we would accept. So as we look going forward, we still see the opportunity then to build on that to grow, both on the business that we already have as well as when we add and we add new verticals. So horticulture is a great example. As you know, there was -- 2 or 3 years ago, there was a rush to invest in that vertical. And people invested a significant amount of money, multiple companies did too to try and pursue that vertical. We identified that vertical then as an attractive vertical. We just didn't think it was worth the level of investment that would -- that the market was asking for at that time.So what we did instead was we started organically. We built a product portfolio from scratch, organically designed from scratch, built from the ground up. And now we've started with the Arize portfolio to add to that and to add to the distribution of that, which gives us a greenlight opportunity to grow in a vertical that, over the long term, we think will be attractive and with a measured level of investment. So when you put that all together, we're choosing where we want to compete in the marketplace, we are demonstrating the ability to do that through product and service innovation as well as through our management of price and margin."", 'Operator', 'Our next question comes from the line of Jeffrey Sprague with Vertical Research.', 'Jeffrey Todd Sprague', ""Maybe just address a little bit more kind of the geographic expansion how you're -- which geographies you're choosing to target the bandwidth of the company to kind of execute on that? And is this something where we could see a higher level of activity from this point forward?"", 'Neil M. Ashe', ""Yes. Thanks, Jeff. So our geographic expansion is focused on the Intelligence Spaces Group. So it's worth pointing out that the standards are mostly global for the Distech product portfolio and the edge to cloud opportunity, the application for Atrius are global. So that gives us the opportunity to expand without having to create new product portfolios with some small exceptions, which are not available to us like Germany, for example. As a result, we are building on the strength there to roll that out. So we have strength in North America, obviously, that's our home market. We are probably half penetrated where we think we can be in the U.S. And so obviously, the bigger markets will invest for growth there. We're also successful in France. I think in the last quarter, we identified we have really high market share in France.We're now expanding into more of Europe, so -- and well through the U.K. and other markets. And then we're focused on markets that look like that. So Australia, we added SI capacity. We'll be looking for ways over the course of kind of the next 6 to 12 months to figure out how to accelerate that expansion for ISG geographically. Our aspiration for that business unit is that it is a global unit that makes spaces smarter, safer and greener through a combination of edge to cloud, edge controls and sensors devices and the cloud or applications that do something with the data that those sensors and controls generate. So yes, you can expect us to be focused on expanding that business globally. And we're basically in North America and France at this point. So there's a big opportunity there."", 'Jeffrey Todd Sprague', ""Great. And then perhaps for Karen. Neil, you can take it too, of course. Just we've gotten this far in the Q&A without any real discussion of price. I know you're not going to talk about price specifically, but maybe just give us a little bit of update and kind of the tone of the market, what you're doing there? And transportation costs were a big topic to the good last quarter. Are you seeing any significant changes there with kind of the chaos and global shipping, everything that's going on?"", 'Neil M. Ashe', ""Chaos is a good word, Karen. Why don't you address pricing?"", 'Karen J. Holcom', ""I'll address some of the pricing. So Jeff, overall, we continue to be really pleased with our gross profit performance. And that really is resulting from what we've talked about on the call already is the strategic management of price and being able to get the value for our products that they deserve in the marketplace. While at the same time, we are working on input costs with our suppliers.We've seen some benefits this quarter in steel and electronics. So that's helping us. And then freight is continuing to benefit year-over-year. So overall, we feel the focus on our portfolio segmentation that we talked about with Contractor Select, Design Select and Made-to-Order helps us on strategically price the products and get the value that they deserve in the marketplace."", 'Operator', 'Our next question comes from the line of Bobby Schultz with Baird.', 'Robert J. Schultz', ""I've been I think, 3 quarters now where you've posted 45% plus gross margins. How should we think about the sustainability of those margins into the second half year and then looking into 2025?"", 'Neil M. Ashe', ""Yes. Thanks, Bobby. So as I mentioned when we were talking about our adjustment to our EPS guidance, we feel really good about our performance. And I'll build on Karen's answer to Jeff's question about price and margin, which is that we are managing our pricing such that we're realizing the value for -- that our products are providing in the marketplace. And on the input cost, we're doing 2 things. One is our product vitality efforts are changing the amount of content that is in each of our products and how we ship those products. So more products can be shipped on the same pallet. So I mentioned the IVO in my opening comments, that's a really innovative product in the marketplace because it's roughly half the size or less of what it is replacing, #1, which obviously means there's a lot less content.It also means that we can fit a lot more on a pallet as we ship those around North America. And then third, it delivers significant value to the installers because of significant patented innovation and how the -- it is constructed at the job site. So the ability to use one housing basically to put in different lighting. So that's a great example of a product that delivers real value to the entire value chain. And the combination of all those things has gotten us to the margin levels where we are right now. So yes, we feel good about our margin performance. It will go up a little -- or up or down a little from quarter to quarter, but we feel really good about kind of the structural improvement of our margin performance. And our team has demonstrated significant dexterity and the ability to deliver on that in all kinds of different market conditions. And so we feel like we're on a journey here, we're not at a destination, and we're pleased with our performance."", 'Robert J. Schultz', 'Got it. And then I wanted to ask on data centers, what is your exposure there today? And kind of what are you seeing in that market right now?', 'Neil M. Ashe', ""So we have 2 exposures to data centers. So on a good news front, data centers have lighting. So one might think that they could operate in the dark, but they don't. So that's a very attractive opportunity and continues to be for the Lighting business. On the Controls side, we are -- Distech is flat spec into some of the largest data scalers, so as their control of choice. There are 2 different kinds of controls in data centers. So we focus on digital controls and so that doesn't -- that means not the entire market is addressable for us, but the market that is addressable for us is growing as we build on those global scalers. We are -- we had another win on that front where over the course of the quarter where we converted a large Asian data center operator to our way of control and so that will be a multiyear opportunity for us going forward. So we're exposed to the data center opportunity in both of our segments, both the Lighting segment as well as the Spaces segment."", 'Operator', 'Our next question comes from the line of Chris Snyder with UBS.', 'Christopher M. Snyder', 'I wanted to ask about the back half guidance. It seems to me that it calls for gross margin to be kind of similar, maybe slightly lower than what we just saw in fiscal Q2, that 45.5%. So I guess, is that right interpretation? And then, what are some of the puts and takes on that because it does seem like there is some volume leverage here from the second quarter to the back half?', 'Neil M. Ashe', ""Yes. Thanks, Chris. Karen can help you after call on building your model, but I'll talk qualitatively about how we're thinking about the back half of the year and build on some of my comments earlier. Our lighting business is strong. We are competing effectively in the marketplace. We are demonstrating that the market is valuing what we are selling from a product perspective. We're demonstrating that we can innovate on a product portfolio and deliver what is -- what our innovative products to the marketplace that are more valuable to the marketplace and more profitable for us. And we've demonstrated that we're managing input costs, material costs in a rapidly changing environment, whether it's electronics or freight or steel or any of the different things.So if we feel really good about the continued performance of -- our continued margin performance, excuse me. So as you look to the back half of the year and more importantly to the year after and the year after that and the year after that, we're on a mission to continue to make this a much more predictable, repeatable, scalable business on the Lighting side and a growth business on the Intelligence Spaces side and to use capital then to expand that portfolio. So we feel fine about the -- we feel good about the guidance for the remainder of the year and we feel even better about the year after and the year after that."", 'Christopher M. Snyder', 'I appreciate that. And maybe just following up on the market competition points. Do you feel like the lighting industry is less competitive from a price standpoint than it was 5 years ago? Or is it that Acuity is being more selective and shying away from the most competitive aspects of the market? And then what you guys have done with Contractor Select is kind of raising the gross margin floor? Just kind of any thoughts on that.', 'Neil M. Ashe', ""Yes. So I wasn't here 5 years ago, so I can't address that, but I will address kind of how we've performed over the last 4 years, which is, I would say that, obviously, we're the largest in the industry. We have the highest margins in the industry. We have the highest product vitality in the industry. We have raised the floor on margins with Contractor Select. We are innovating with Design Select and our new portfolio. So our performance is objectively very strong. That makes us a much more formidable competitor to the marketplace, no matter who you are, whether you're a large competitor, you're a small competitor, whether you're housed in North America or somewhere else, we're just a significantly stronger competitor than we were 4 years ago. And so that puts us in a position to have significantly more control over our destiny. And we're demonstrating that control in our performance. And so -- and we think this is a good point to build on. So we will continue to press our advantage on the lighting side. So I would answer your question by saying something that we said when the market was really choppy, which is that we control what we can control, we are controlling more of what's happening in the marketplace as a result of our strategy and the execution of that strategy and the cumulative performance and the impact of that."", 'Christopher M. Snyder', ""I appreciate that. And if I could just squeeze one last one in. And I know it's hard to call a cycle, but I'd be interested, Neil, in where you think we are in this nonresidential construction cycle? Activity is still pretty healthy. A lot of the leading indicators are, I wouldn't say terribly negative, but on the more negative side. Do you feel like that cycle pressure on the horizon or that -- maybe you already felt that with a lot of the destock? Just any thoughts on it, I appreciate it."", 'Neil M. Ashe', ""Yes, sure, Chris. I think the cycle question has been a really hard one because we collectively -- and by that, I mean the economy, industry, et cetera, has been thrown so many curveballs over the course of the last 3 years. So I feel like we've lived kind of multiple years in a single year or a single period. So it's hard to call it as a normal historical cycle. So obviously, we had the shutdown. Then we had the bullwhip of projects and activity that was waiting to be executed, which led to increased backlogs, which we accelerated to satisfy which happened last year, and you see a little bit of the hangover impact on our sales growth this year. We've been looking at the market on a multiyear basis, though. So when you look at first the market on a multiyear basis, it really does start to normalize. It doesn't look like there's any kind of boom and bust cycle. It looks like there was just a fair amount of business that got executed last year that maybe would have normally been executed this year. And so as we look forward, we are -- and I've mentioned this on the call before, we do a fair amount of data analysis, and I think we're pretty good at it. And we're outperforming the regression analysis of what we would expect to do.So we are -- our performance is a contributor to where we are. As we think about the cycle going forward, we strive for normalcy. We don't feel like we need a really super-hot environment or -- and we've demonstrated we can execute in a relatively cool environment. So kind of where are we on the cycle front? I would say that our data indicates that lighting moves earlier than the other parts of the industry. There are a thousand reasons for that to have happened, but that has been borne out in other people's performance. And we feel good about kind of where we are from an order rate perspective.We've seen that relationship between lighting and other industries between ABL and the Spaces Group with Distech. So in Distech, we're also outperforming what the market's expectations are. So we're outperforming where our SIs expect to be, which means we're taking share there also. So then as we look forward, what we strive for is a more normalized environment. I'm not confident calling a cycle because I don't think this is a normal cycle or it doesn't look like cycles that were sleep studies that we've had in the past.Taking now 3 steps back. Our Lighting and Lighting Controls business grows consistently over time on a compounded annual growth rate and our Spaces group is taking share, and we're building something pretty special there. So net-net, we feel like we can execute in any environment. I don't want to play kind of Fed governor and try and figure out where we are from a cycle perspective other than to say, we're going to control what we can control. We feel really good about where we are from the Lighting and Lighting Controls business. We feel really good about where we are from the Spaces business, and we've got a lot of capital to grow our platform."", 'Operator', 'Our next question comes from the line of Jeff Osborne with TD Cowen.', 'Jeffrey David Osborne', ""Neil, maybe just a follow-up on the prior question. In terms of -- I think the last earnings call, you touched on a rebound in larger projects visible in 2025. I'm just curious what the CRM system showing for the larger projects. And then historically, I think larger projects were considerably more profitable than the Contractor Select and some of the more commoditized projects that you've greatly improved the profitability of. Would you expect as the potential rebound of those larger projects flows through, that there's a disproportionate mix shift in profitability?"", 'Neil M. Ashe', ""Yes, thanks. As I said, so if we focus on the kind of -- large projects is big bucket. So let's talk about kind of infrastructure on the one hand and then we'll talk about kind of traditional large projects on the other. So on the infrastructure side, there's obviously still a significant amount of capital that's going to run through what others are calling the mega projects. And we're confident we'll get our fair share of those and hopefully, a disproportionate share. And from a mix perspective, that is an attractive piece of business, we price fairly there. So we're delivering value to basically the citizens who are funding those. So we feel good about that. At the same time, we can operate in the margin portfolio that we expect. Then within kind of larger projects, there are a number of other kind of private sector impacts of that also.So impact of the CHIPS Act and our ability to light fabs, to light data centers, to deliver control, obviously, those are all consistently attractive margin pieces of business for us. We're scaling in industrial as a lot of reshoring is happening in the U.S. And so the mix of our portfolio is, however, tighter from a margin perspective. As we indicated earlier, effectively, the floor has been raised on the Contractor Select portfolio and we will price fairly to the -- for citizens that are funding the infrastructure, and we'll continue to deliver the performance that we're demonstrating."", 'Jeffrey David Osborne', 'Got it. And then just one for Karen on the Contractor Select and Design Select portfolios. Does that, by definition, sort of require more investment in inventory than you might have had in the few years past?', 'Karen J. Holcom', ""So for Contractor Select and Design Select, when we look at the inventory levels, first on Contractor Select, the 300 of the kind of most common everyday lighting products. We stock those here, but then also our distributors. But given the high turnover with that portfolio, it allows our distributors to carry less inventory and also for us to carry less inventory. So that doesn't really have a higher requirement. On Design Select, we are able to manage those inventory levels effectively and improve our turns. So neither of those should have a negative impact on our working capital inventory going forward. And in fact, if you look at our inventory days over the course of time, we are -- we've improved our inventory turns versus last year and versus kind of over -- from our high point and certainly over last year when we reduced it and then continue to have room to improve. So we feel really good about where we are on our inventory and don't believe that, that should have a negative impact. And if anything, some of that should improve our ability around our raw materials going forward."", 'Operator', ""And I'm showing no further questions in the queue at this time. I'd like to turn the call back to Neil Ashe for any closing remarks."", 'Neil M. Ashe', ""Thank you. Thank you all for joining us this morning. We are -- as we said in our comments and in the questions, we're really pleased with our performance. Our team is executing really well. We feel confident in where the Lighting and Lighting Controls business is for this year and beyond, we feel like our growth opportunity on the Spaces side is clear, and we're executing against it. And we've demonstrated that we can create real value with capital allocation. And so we'll keep doing that, and we'll look forward to seeing you next quarter. Thank you."", 'Operator', ""This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.""]"

A top banking regulator is considering a plan to ensure that these asset management giants stick to their passive role when it comes to investing in U.S. banks. The news was first reported by the Wall Street Journal.Per a regulatory official familiar with the matter, Jonathan McKernan and Rohit Chopra, board members of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp (“FDIC”), held meetings with BLK and Vanguard to discuss their holdings.Presently, asset managers operate under “passivity commitments,” meaning that they refrain from certain influential activities in banks wherein they hold large investments in exchange for less burdensome regulatory oversight.However, in a speech this January, McKernan argued that regulators should increase the scrutiny of asset managers to ensure that the firms are upholding those commitments, as they primarily rely on firms to self-certify.McKernan is now advocating an order that would direct the FDIC staff to regularly examine large asset managers who have more than a 10% stake in FDIC-regulated banks in order to ensure that these asset managers are not wrongly influencing their operations.However, the financial industry is currently opposing the effort to add more regulatory oversight.Lindsey Keljo, a managing director with the Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association, said, “We see no reason to institute duplicative regulations on passive investments in banking organizations without far more justification and proof that these investments are in fact harming banks and their depositors.”Vanguard stated, “We look forward to continuing our constructive dialogue with the FDIC to answer questions about Vanguard’s proven, long-term investment approach.”BLK declined to comment, whereas STT did not respond to the requests for comment.Notably, many a time, asset managers are criticized for exerting undue influence on the management of their portfolio companies. The firms have also been blamed by lawmakers for prioritizing political motives over financial objectives.As an example, BlackRock was attacked for its use of environmental, social and governance (“ESG”) factors in investing. However, the company denied the allegations, citing the billions that it invested in energy companies.Currently, BLK and STT carry a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

For the fourth quarter and full year, we drove strong performance that was ahead of our guidance for both top and bottom line, driven by the strength of our two iconic brands Calvin Klein and Tommy Hilfiger and the disciplined execution of our PVH+ Plan. This included a very strong holiday season. For the fourth quarter, we drove double-digit growth in our owned and operated e-commerce and high-single digit growth in our stores. This was offset by a challenging wholesale channel resulting in flat revenues overall for the quarter on a reported basis and down 1% in constant currency. We continued to drive quality of sales up with higher AURs and we expanded our gross margins by 440 basis points year-over-year.', ""On a non GAAP basis, we delivered 40% increase in EBIT dollars and 12.1% EBIT margin and an EPS growth of over 50%. For the full year, we grew revenue 2% on a reported basis and 1% in constant currency, including high-single digit D2C growth, while expanding our gross margins by 140 basis points and we drove a 9% increase in EBIT dollars and a 60 basis point increase in EBIT's margins to 10.1% and we delivered EPS growth of nearly 20% and achieved a record high EPS. We ended the year with inventory in great shape down 21% compared to last year and produced significant cash flow, which we used to buy back approximately 550 million of stock. Looking back on the first two years of PVH+ Plan execution, you can see a clear trend in that where we lean in to execute, we deliver."", ""We have put 100% of our focus on our globally beloved iconic brands Calvin and Tommy, and divested all other regionally focused brands. We are building a very strong leadership team with experience to move PVH from a legacy brand acquirer to leading brand builder. Today, I'm especially excited to share that Lea Rytz Goldman is starting this week as Tommy Hilfiger Global President. Lea most recently comes from successfully leading the COS brand's impressive global growth. Through the PVH+ Plan, we have driven strong D2C growth for both 2022 and 2023 across all brands and all regions through strength in product, marketing, and marketplace execution. We have developed strong product category offense in key categories and must have hero products, significantly increasing AURs and gross margin rate."", 'We are executing breakthrough campaigns with very strong global talent amplification to really cut through with the consumer. During 2023, Calvin drove more consumer engagement than at any other time in the history of the brand with mega talents such as Jennie Kim, Jung Kook, Kendall Jenner, Michael B. Jordan and most recently Jeremy Allen White. And Tommy went back to his roots of classic American cool, most recently created cut through global attention with his return to New York Fashion Week. We have strengthened the brand experience across social, e-commerce and stores, and in an increasingly tough wholesale channel, we have deepened our relationships with our key partners and applied a strong quality of sales focus globally. Regionally, we have grown our European business in a very tough macro environment with our business today over $4 billion over 20% larger than 2019 and driving higher profits.', 'We have started to successfully unlock North America despite a choppy backdrop driving significant margin expansion, including an 8.3% EBIT margin for 2023 and we are taking back our license of core product categories as part of a multi-year transition beginning in 2025, which will allow us to draw on the power and expertise of our global brand teams. We have also turned Asia into a growth engine where we are now taking share on a consistent basis with double-digit constant currency revenue growth in both 2022 and 2023. As a company, we have successfully started to build out our data and demand-driven operating model. We are reducing inventory as a percentage of sales while driving higher availability and stock freshness. The quality of our product is up, the cost of goods is down and the pricing power is up, all leading to higher gross margins.', 'We continue to invest behind our growth initiatives including increasing marketing spend to approximately 6% of sales for 2023 to fuel cut-through campaigns and global talent amplification all while driving cost efficiencies across the company, and we have significantly increased our cash flow, enable us to invest in growth and increase our share buybacks to historically high levels. Over the last two years, we have repurchased nearly $1 billion of our stock representing approximately 17% of our outstanding shares. Now, let me share a bit more of what drove our strong performance in the fourth quarter and full year, both from a global brand and regional perspective. Starting with Calvin Klein, the brand continued to cut through with record strong global campaigns.', ""In the fourth quarter, our spring campaign with Jeremy Allen White captured global attention generating over $12 million in media exposure in the first 48 hours and reaching more than 40 million on the brand's Instagram. Our hero underwear styles were in the heart of culture conversation, followed by Jeremy styled in Calvin's menswear for its Golden Globes win. In the U.S. alone, week one of the campaign generated more than 30% growth in underwear versus last year. The campaign continued with Idris Elba in menswear, Jennie Kim, and Kendall Jenner in women's wear and Jung Kook in our most iconic denim, all to amplify our Calvin Klein lifestyle offering. Turning to Tommy Hilfiger. In Tommy, we continue to drive relevance by leaning into the brand's unique DNA of classic American cool."", ""We started off the year with Tommy's return to New York Fashion Week creating a true New York moment and driving both high visibility and engagement. The Runway show had massive talent reach resulting in over 3,000 PR placements and a reach of over 6 billion. We were the most talked about brand at New York Fashion Week dominating online conversation. In February, we announced Sofia Richie as the new partner for Tommy Womenswear and last month Tommy launched its Spring 2024 campaign featuring Kendall Jenner. And yesterday, we launched a global cut-through campaign featuring StrayKids, one of the top three K-pop bands worldwide. Now, let me turn to our regional performance, starting with North America. I'm very proud of how our team continued to lean into the PVH+ Plan drivers in the fourth quarter achieving strong D2C growth, up high-single digits for both brands and delivering a significant improvement in profitability."", 'For the fourth quarter, we again delivered a double-digit EBIT margin for the region including higher gross margins and AURs. Overall revenue for Tommy and Calvin was stronger than we expected driven by strong growth in direct-to-consumer, which was offset by declines in wholesale. For 2023, our Calvin and Tommy businesses together delivered an 8.3% EBIT margin, a big step up of nearly 500 basis points year-over-year despite modestly lower revenues. This demonstrates the significant progress we are making in building the foundation for long-term brand accretive growth in the North America region. Let me share a few North America highlights. For Tommy, the D2C growth was broad based led by seasonal premium essentials in key categories with strong AUR increases.', ""We returned a number of stores back to 2019 profitability levels despite much lower international tourism. And for Calvin, leading with our category offers, we successfully reestablished our refined assortment. We continue to elevate online shopping experience and have delivered four consecutive quarters of high quality double-digit growth on CK.com. For both brands, we continue to build strength with our key wholesale partners led by men's sportswear. Looking to 2024 for North America. We plan to deliver another year of strong D2C growth with further increases in quality of sales across the marketplace to deliver another year of significant improvement in profitability. Turning to our international business. In Europe, building on our historically large business, market leading awareness and brand strength across both Tommy and Calvin, for 2023, the region delivered low-single digit revenue growth in euros."", ""In the fourth quarter, revenue again exceeded EUR1 billion and most importantly delivered much stronger overall profitability. Revenue for the quarter declined low-single digits in euros compared to last year and in an increasingly tough macro, we drove mid-single digit growth in D2C, which was offset by declines in wholesale. Since we spoke in December, we have seen consumer sentiment further slow across Europe, especially, in our two biggest markets, Germany and the U.K., and we have seen our wholesale partners there become even more cautious. Let me share a few examples of what this tougher European macro means for us, and how we're choosing to sacrifice sales growth in the near term to strengthen our unique brand position in the market for the long term."", ""Our number one focus here has been to avoid having too much inventory in the market, and we have succeeded very well with this starting the year with much less old clearance inventory than the same time last year, driven by our supply chain improvements. As an example, in February, we were up against a greater proportion of discounted sales last year and this year, we made the proactive decision to come into the month with lower outgoing stock and higher share of the new spring season inventory. As an effect, we're starting the spring season with significantly improved stock freshness, which is driving double-digit comp increases for our spring product while prior season clearance sales and inventory are down over 20%. In wholesale, forward orders from our partners have become more cautious."", ""This is reflected in our fall 2024 order books, which we expect will be down high-single digits versus the prior year. It's important to remember that our wholesale partners are coming off a very tough fall season across the sector from last year, driven by the warmest fall starts since the 1,800s which led to too much inventory and high promotionality in the market. In this tougher environment, we are making proactive decisions towards quality of sales to build our brands for the long term and position us for sustainable brand accretive growth. In wholesale, this means in mid-year 2024, we are stopping sales of our brands by third parties on digital platforms and significantly reducing the number of digital platforms that we sell to. This will increase the quality of sales with our most important wholesale partners across both bricks-and-mortar and online."", ""And across all channels, we are buying inventory much closer to demand significantly reducing our need to manage discounted prior season inventory. The collective impact of these quality of sales decisions is a reduction equivalent of approximately 5% of our total sales for our 2024 European business. It will drive gross margin expansion and more importantly enable brand accretive growth over time. In parallel to these quality of sales improvements, we're also stepping up our product category offers, driving innovation in key categories and must have essentials for fall 2024, where we will have more transitional products, more technical fabrics, more dress casual and this has been very well received by our key wholesale partners. It will also further strengthen our D2C execution where we have the most control over the brand experience and we continue to drive increased pricing power and margin expansion."", ""Moving to Asia-Pacific, our Asia team's disciplined PVH+ Plan execution across both Calvin and Tommy drove strong growth for both the quarter and the year. For the year, the region delivered revenue growth of 15% in constant currency including growth of 17% in the fourth quarter led by D2C. China is an important growth engine with growth over 20% in local currency for both the fiscal year and fourth quarter as we successfully captured key consumer moments. Outside of China, fourth quarter performance was also strong with over 30% growth in Korea and double-digit growth in Japan in constant currency. We delivered strong e-commerce growth with both brands achieving double-digit growth during Double 11 and ranked among the top international brands on Tmall."", ""Revenue and market share set new records on Douyin as we continue to engage consumers in new ways. We continue to win in the important Lunar New Year holiday fueled by successful capsule launches and consumer activations for both brands. Our brands and products have a clear premium positioning with opportunity to grow further in all markets. We continue to focus on driving overall brand awareness, especially in China where both Calvin and Tommy are underpenetrated. Now, let's switch gears and turn to our overall company outlook. Following the strong 2023 where we gain traction on each of the underlying growth drivers of the PVH+ Plan, we will build on this momentum in 2024. Across the company, we are leaning into the next level of PVH+ execution."", ""This will directly translate into growth in Asia and North America, while in Europe where the macro has become more challenging, our focus is on quality of sales to further strengthen our market leading position. From a number's perspective, this translates into our guidance for 2024 of revenue down 6% to 7% or down approximately 3% to 4% on a comparable basis, excluding the sale of our Heritage Brands intimates business at 53rd week in 2023. We're driving further gross margin expansion and despite the deleverage from our European business, we will maintain our EBIT margins versus 2023. At the same time, Zac will take you through how we are leaning in to unlock significant cost efficiencies in a way that we will even better align our cost structure to the PVH+ growth drivers leading to another year of EPS growth in 2024."", ""As we go forward, we will further strengthen Calvin and Tommy's brand desirability by building out our global product, marketing experience engines under the strong global brand leadership that we now have in place. We will continue to amplify our category offense and key hero product strategies globally. We will further win with consumer engagement by executing strong cut through campaigns amplified by the best global mega talent. And in the marketplace, we are relentlessly focused on driving higher quality of sales across all regions and channels which will continue to drive pricing power and margin expansion across the company. Everywhere the consumer and macro will allow we will drive high quality revenue growth and where the consumer and macro are tougher, we are willing to sacrifice short term, low quality revenues in order to strengthen our brand position and pricing power."", ""This is the right way to build our brands and business for the long term. In D2C where we have the most direct control of the shopping experience, you will see us drive high quality growth across both brands and all regions. We will continue to elevate the consumer experience online and offline in our owned and operated channels as well as with key wholesale partners. You will see us continue to build out our demand driven supply chain, maximizing inventory productivity and across the company, you will see us investing in long term growth in areas including marketing as well as CapEx for technology, store renovations, new store expansion and supply chain initiatives. At the same time, we're getting in even better shape from a cost-efficiency perspective which Zac will share more details on."", ""And lastly, we will continue to significantly improve our cash flow, which will enable us to make further stock repurchases. In closing, in 2023, we fully focused on and strengthened the desirability of our two globally iconic brands, Calvin Klein and Tommy Hilfiger, and we drove very strong financial performance across both brands and all regions. For 2024, we will continue to build on the PVH+ execution momentum across the company that will translate directly to growth in Asia and North America, while we sacrifice near-term sales growth in Europe to further strengthen our unique market position there for long-term brand accretive growth. Our PVH plus momentum is building in both the consumer-facing parts driving the brand desirability up in product, marketing and marketplace, and in how we build out the data and demand-driven business engine step by step guided by our PVH+ Plan, we're building Calvin Klein and Tommy Hilfiger into the most desirable lifestyle brands in the world and making PVH one of the highest-performing brand groups in our sector."", ""And I want to thank my entire team for all your great work in making our vision come to life. And now, I'll turn the call over to Zac."", 'Zac Coughlin: Thank you, Stefan and good morning. My comments are based on non-GAAP results and are reconciled in our press release. As Stefan discussed, we are pleased with our results for the fourth quarter and full year 2023 driven by our iconic brands and disciplined execution of the PVH+ Plan. For the fourth quarter, we delivered revenue flat to the prior year and more importantly, we delivered significant earnings growth in the quarter versus last year led by the sizable step up in our gross margin we had planned for all year. Our EBIT was $301 million, 40% higher than prior year and our operating margin for the quarter was 12.1% up 350 basis points versus last year. On the bottom line, we once again exceeded our guidance with a record-setting fourth quarter non-GAAP earnings per share of $3.72 which was over 50% higher than last year.', 'Our ability to drive significant operating margin expansion and earnings growth in spite of the challenging macroeconomic environment is a testament to our disciplined execution. We also delivered strong cash flow this year with free cash flow of over $700 million. This includes inventory being down 21% compared to last year as we continue to position inventory to focus on quality of sales. We also completed the sale of our Heritage intimates business in the fourth quarter for $160 million. The results of our work on cash allowed us to repurchase $280 million of shares in the fourth quarter and an all-time high of 550 million share repurchases for the full year. I will now discuss our 2023 results in more detail and then move on to our outlook for 2024.', 'As I mentioned earlier, revenue for the fourth quarter was flat compared to last year and reflected a 1% positive impact from exchange. The benefit from the 53rd week was largely offset by the revenue reduction from the sale of the Heritage intimates business. Starting from a regional perspective, fourth quarter revenue for our international business was up 3% on a constant currency basis. Sales in our Asia Pacific business were up 17% on a constant currency basis and up 13% on a reported basis as strong consumer demand drove growth in all markets led by China, where the lifting of COVID restrictions negatively impacted the fourth quarter last year. Sales in Europe were down 2% in euros as mid-single digit growth in the DTC business was more than offset by high-single digit decline in wholesale sales.', 'In North America, revenue for the Tommy Hilfiger and Calvin Klein businesses combined was down 2% as high-single digit growth in DTC was more than offset by a decline in wholesale sales. Within DTC, our retail stores were up high single digits and our owned and operated e-commerce business was up mid-teens. Looking at overall fourth quarter revenue from a channel perspective, we continue to drive strong performance across all regions in our DTC businesses. Our total DTC revenue was up 9% on both a reported and constant currency basis in the quarter and also up 9% on a constant currency basis in both our stores and our owned and operated e-commerce with approximately half of the increase due to the benefit from the 53rd week. Total wholesale revenue for the quarter was down 10% on a reported basis and down 12% on a constant currency basis as retailers around the world continue to take a cautious approach to orders and shipments, this includes a 3% reduction from the sale of the Heritage intimates business and a benefit from the 53rd week.', 'Turning to our global brands. Calvin Klein revenues were up 4% and Tommy Hilfiger revenues were up 1% on a reported basis. On a constant currency basis, revenue for Calvin Klein was up 3% and Tommy Hilfiger was down 1% as the macroeconomic challenges impacting Europe weigh more heavily on the Tommy business. Importantly, our DTC business was up in both brands and in all regions. In the fourth quarter, we delivered record high gross margin of 60.3%, an increase of 440 basis points compared to last year with approximately half of the improvement due to a favorable shift in channel and region mix and approximately half due to lower raw material costs and ocean freight rates. SG&A expense as a percent of revenue for the fourth quarter was 48.2% an increase of approximately 100 basis points versus the prior year.', ""The increase is more than explained by higher expenses due to DTC mix, partially offset by an approximately 125 basis point improvement in expenses versus last year due to savings realized from the actions we have taken to reduce people cost and prudent management of expenses. In total, EBIT for the quarter was $301 million, 40% higher than the prior year and exceeding expectations. Operating margin was 12.1% and expanded 350 basis points compared to last year with improvements in all regions including a 550 basis point expansion for North America for Calvin Klein and Tommy Hilfiger combined. Earnings per share increased over 50% to $3.72 compared to $2.38 in last year's fourth quarter and exceeded our guidance by $0.27 largely driven by the EBIT improvement."", 'Our tax rate for the quarter was approximately 21%. For the full year 2023, we drove significant profitability and earnings growth versus last year in spite of the challenging macro environment. Revenue was up 2% versus last year including a positive impact of 1% from exchange and EBIT was up 9% driven by operating margin expansion. Our operating margin of 10.1% reflected a 60 basis points improvement versus last year and on the bottom line we delivered record high non-GAAP EPS of $10.68 for the year, which reflected growth of 19%. Now, moving on to our outlook. In 2024, we are committed to building on the momentum coming out of 2023, leaning into the PVH+ Plan to drive profitability improvements in North America, strong growth in Asia Pacific, a focus on quality of sales in Europe further matching inventory to demand and delivering efficiencies to fund future growth.', 'That said, we have taken a cautious approach to planning 2024 due to the softening consumer backdrop we saw in January and February in a conservative wholesale environment. For the full year, overall revenue is projected to decline between 6% and 7% on both a reported and constant currency basis compared to 2023, including a 2% decline due to the sale of the Heritage intimates business and a 1% decline due to the 53rd week in 2023. We expect full year operating margin will be approximately flat compared to 10.1% in 2023 and are projecting earnings per share in a range of $10.75 to $11 up low single digits versus 2023 despite the top line pressures. Our sales outlook for the North America Calvin Klein and Tommy Hilfiger businesses combined is planned up low-single digits versus 2023 with mid-single digit growth in the DTC business tempered by wholesale.', 'Within wholesale, we are focused on strong quality of sales and winning with our key wholesale partners, but we do see retailers continue to take a cautious approach. This wholesale environment is also impacting our licensing partners in the region and our overall licensing revenue is planned down high-single digits. Asia Pacific has planned to grow high-single digits on a constant currency basis with growth again projected in all markets and led by DTC. Now turning to Europe. As Stefan mentioned, we saw consumer sentiment further slow in January and February and our fall 2024 order books are increasingly cautious. In this tougher environment, we are making strategic choices to focus on higher quality sales across all channels. As a result, we have planned Europe sales down high-single digits in euros, wholesale has planned down low double-digits for the reasons I just mentioned and DTC is planned down low-single digits with modest comp door growth offset by reductions in our owned sales through third-party platforms.', 'While overall revenue is projected to be lower than 2023, our gross margin is expected to increase approximately 200 basis points reaching an all-time high with approximately half of the increase due to channel and customer mix as we grow our higher margin DTC business and decreased sales to lower margin wholesale accounts and approximately half due to lower raw material costs, which were elevated during the first half of 2023, but began to ease in the second half. SG&A dollars are planned down for the full year 2024 as compared to 2023, but are expected to increase approximately 200 basis points as a percentage of revenue. Approximately 150 basis points of the increase is due to the deleverage of expenses on our lower European revenues in 2024 and approximately 150 basis points is due to higher DTC mix.', 'Beyond those two impacts, we continue to drive approximately 100 basis points of cost efficiencies across the business while at the same time maintaining strategic investments in our global brands including marketing in order to drive long term growth. As a result, we expect our full year operating margin will be approximately flat compared to 10.1% in 2023. Excluding a significant impact of deleverage due to sales, operating margin would have been approximately 150 basis points higher. Interest expense is projected to be relatively flat compared to $88 million in 2023 and our tax rate for the year is estimated at approximately 21%. Looking at the balance sheet, we are heading into 2024 in a very strong financial position. Working capital is in great shape and our leverage is low.', 'We are projecting capital spending of approximately $300 million as we invest in our stores, supply chain and technology in line with our PVH+ priorities. And with the $2 billion increase to our share repurchase program that we announced yesterday, we are currently planning $400 million of share repurchases in 2024. Turning to the first quarter, we are projecting revenue to decline approximately 11% as reported and approximately 10% on a constant currency basis compared to the prior year, including a 3% decline due to the sale of the Heritage intimates business and a 1% decline due to the impact on wholesale sales from the 53rd week in 2023. While we are projecting low-single digit growth in our DTC businesses, we expect this will be more than offset by a decline in wholesale revenue primarily in Europe for the reasons I mentioned earlier.', 'We expect our first quarter operating margin to be approximately flat to first quarter last year with higher gross margins fully offsetting the loss of leverage due to the decline in revenue. Our first quarter earnings per share is projected to be approximately $2.15 compared to $2.14 in the prior year. Our tax rate for the first quarter is estimated at approximately 21% and interest expense is projected to be approximately $20 million. Looking ahead beyond 2024, we remain confident in our path to achieve the 15% operating margin target we committed in the PVH+ Plan. We will do that through improvements in both gross margin and SG&A. As discussed earlier, we will take a significant step up in 2024 in gross margin through a focus on quality of sales and significant supply chain improvements.', 'We expect to see the improvements continue beyond 2024 and while we have made significant progress in SG&A expenses, we are not close to done there either. We are embarking on the next phase of growth driver five of the PVH+ Plan to drive efficiencies in a couple of meaningful ways. First, on technology, we have completed a global study of our IT spending and the result is a roadmap to decrease global technology spending by over one-third. We will do that by delivering a single global tech stack that all business units will leverage. And in January, we onboarded a new global Chief Technology and Information Officer with experience driving global transformational change at other best-in-class consumer companies. Next is a focus on global logistics costs.', ""We've already delivered a significant reduction in inventory. This lighter supply chain allows us to redesign our global logistics network to be more efficient. We expect this to deliver over 50 basis points in operating margin improvement. There is also ongoing work that continues within our support functions globally. We see opportunities to centralize processes and improve systems and automation to drive more efficient and cost-effective ways of working again led by a focus on consistent execution of the PVH+ Plan around the world. We believe this would generate at least 50 basis points of operating margin improvement. And finally, in Europe. Historically, our global Tommy Hilfiger global brand and Europe commercial organizations have been highly intertwined leading to complex ways of working."", 'With the appointment of Lea Rytz Goldman as the leader for the global Tommy brand, this allows us the opportunity to reengineer the European operating model and unlock significant efficiencies. The work on these initiatives has already begun and will continue over the next couple of years. We expect this work to result in an incremental 200 basis points to 300 basis points of operating margin improvement on top of the SG&A leverage we expect to recapture as we grow our global brands in the future. Before we open up for questions, I want to reiterate that we remain confident in our ability to win in a tough environment as evidenced by our performance in 2023. We continue to work relentlessly to drive results and as Stefan talked about earlier, we are laser focused on executing the five key growth drivers of the PVH+ Plan bringing together the consumer facing growth drivers of product, consumer engagement and marketplace with our underlying operating engines to deliver sustainable, long term profitable growth.', 'And with that operator, we would like to open it up to questions.', 'See also Insiders Are Buying These 11 Penny Stocks and 11 Magnificent Dividend Growth Stocks to Buy and Hold Forever.', 'To continue reading the Q&A session, please click here.']"

Strong momentum in the energy end market is driving revenues in the Uniform Rental and Facility Services segment. Also, investments in technology and the company’s capability to weed out inefficiencies from the business through Six Sigma bode well for the segment. Increasing demand for AED Rentals, eyewash stations and WaterBreak products is boosting the First Aid and Safety Services segment’s performance.Given the strength across its segments, Cintas has provided a bullish forecast for fiscal 2024 (May 2024). The company expects revenues of $9.57-$9.60 billion. The midpoint of the guidance, $9.585 billion, indicates year-over-year growth of 8.7%. Earnings per share are estimated to be in the range of $14.80-$15.00. The midpoint of the guided range, $14.90, reflects a year-over-year increase of 14.7%.Accretive Acquisition: Acquisitions form a key part of Cintas’ strategy to build market share. The company acquired Paris Uniform Services, a family-owned supplier of uniform and facility service solutions, in March 2024. The buyout enhances Cintas’ service delivery capacity. In February 2024, the company acquired SITEX to strengthen its leading market position in the central Midwest region of the United States.Product Enhancement Efforts: The company's focus on the enhancement of its product portfolio, along with investments in technology and existing facilities, should continue to drive its performance. For instance, the company’s SmartTruck technology enhances its route efficiencies and provides density to the existing routes. Also, Cintas’ focus on operational executions and pricing actions is helping it maintain healthy margin performance. In the first nine months of fiscal 2024 (ended February 2024), the gross margin increased 150 basis points to 48.7% from the year-ago reported number.Rewards to Shareholders: Cintas’ measures to reward its shareholders through dividend payments and share buybacks are noteworthy. In the first nine months of fiscal 2024, dividend payments totaled $393.3 million, up 18.3% year over year. Cintas repurchased shares worth $468.1 million in the same period, up 26.2% year over year.

Since this decade began, all three major stock indexes traded off bear and bull markets on a couple of occasions.', 'When uncertainty picks up on Wall Street, both professional and retail investors have a tendency to seek out the safety and historic outperformance of industry-leading businesses. It\'s why the ""FAANG stocks"" have been so popular over the last decade. But for the past three years, investors have really gravitated to stocks enacting splits.', ""A stock split is a purely cosmetic event that allows publicly traded companies to adjust their share price and outstanding share count by the same magnitude. The key with stock splits is they have no impact on market cap or operating performance. Their purpose is to make shares more nominally affordable for investors who may not have access to fractional-share purchases with their online broker (a forward stock split), or to increase a company's share price to ensure continued listing on a major stock exchange (a reverse stock split)."", ""Though there are a few examples of successful reverse stock splits, such as online travel company Booking Holdings, most investors tend to focus on companies enacting forward stock splits. That's because companies enacting forward splits are usually highfliers with well-defined competitive advantages."", ""Since the midpoint of 2021, close to a dozen top-notch businesses have conducted forward splits, including the infrastructure backbone of the artificial intelligence (AI) movement, Nvidia; leading global internet search engine parent Alphabet; and North America's top electric vehicle manufacturer, Tesla."", 'Thus far in 2024, two exceptionally successful businesses with well-defined competitive advantages have joined the club:', 'Walmart (NYSE: WMT) completed a 3-for-1 stock split in late February; and', 'Chipotle Mexican Grill is on track to enact a 50-for-1 forward split by late June, assuming its shareholders approve the move when the company holds its annual meeting.', 'Walmart kicked things off in late January when it announced plans to conduct its first split since March 1999.', 'Walmart President and CEO Doug McMillon noted in a company press release that, ""Given our growth and our plans for the future, we felt it was a good time to split the stock and encourage our associates to participate in the years to come."" Specifically, this move should help over 400,000 associates purchase whole shares of Walmart stock, rather than fractional shares.', ""If there's one factor that exemplifies why Walmart has been such a phenomenal investment for decades, look no further than its size. Walmart's deep pockets allow it to buy products in bulk, which in turn lowers its per-unit costs. The company has consistently been able to undercut grocery chains and local retailers on price."", 'To add, Walmart almost always carries a broader assortment of goods, including groceries, than traditional grocers and retailers. A generally cheaper and broader selection has been a winning formula.', 'But even winners have their limits.', ""Following its post-split run-up, Walmart stock is now valued at 23 times forward-year earnings. Though this is more or less right in line with its forward-year earnings multiple over the last five years, it's a reach for a company whose growth rate is slowing and struggling to outpace the prevailing rate of inflation."", ""In fiscal 2024 (Walmart's fiscal year ended on Jan. 26, 2024), consolidated sales rose by just 4.9% on a constant-currency basis, which excludes any gains or losses from foreign currency conversion. In the current fiscal year, Walmart's constant-currency sales growth is expected to slow to just 3% to 4%. Mind you, the trailing-12-month inflation rate in the U.S. is 3.2%. Walmart is simply treading water in the current climate."", 'While long-term investors in Walmart should be just fine, there are other potential stock-split stocks that are considerably cheaper and smarter buys.', ""The first company primed for a stock split that's markedly cheaper than Walmart is semiconductor stock Broadcom (NASDAQ: AVGO). Though Broadcom enacted three splits prior to being acquired by Avago Technologies (which kept the Broadcom name) in 2016, Avago itself has never undertaken any stock splits. Broadcom ended the trading session on April 2 at nearly $1,339 per share."", ""At the moment, Broadcom is being fueled by the AI revolution. The company's Jericho3-AI chip, which was unveiled last April, is designed to scale connectivity in high-compute enterprise data centers and can connect up to 32,000 graphics processing units. This is just the type of innovation needed to train large language models and power generative AI solutions."", ""But Broadcom has fallbacks that extend well beyond AI. For example, it's a leading provider of wireless chips and accessories used in next-generation smartphones. Carriers upgrading their networks to support 5G download speeds have provided Broadcom with steady demand as businesses and consumers replace their older wireless devices."", ""To add to the above, Broadcom has other operating segments that benefit from increased digitization. For instance, the company's automotive solutions address everything from advanced driver assistance systems to battery management in next-generation vehicles. Meanwhile, it offers financial services software and infrastructure designed to improve the digital banking experience for consumers and employees."", ""While Broadcom's forward-year price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 23.5 is effectively in line with Walmart's, its estimated annualized earnings growth rate over the next five years of 14.4% is considerably higher. Thus, Broadcom's price/earnings-to-growth ratio (PEG ratio) is far more attractive than Walmart's."", ""The second potential stock-split stock that makes for a considerably cheaper and smarter buy than Walmart is none other than social media maven Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: META). Meta hasn't split since becoming a public company in 2012 and recently hit an all-time high of a little north of $520 per share."", 'If you\'re wondering what makes Meta ""tick,"" take a closer look at its social media assets. Facebook is the most-visited social site globally, with 3.07 billion monthly active users (MAUs) in the December-ended quarter. Adding in Meta\'s other exceptionally popular platforms, including WhatsApp, Instagram, Threads, and Facebook Messenger, brings the company\'s unique MAU count to 3.98 billion for the fourth quarter. It\'s not difficult to attract advertisers and command strong ad-pricing power when more than half of the world\'s adult population is visiting at least one of your owned assets each month.', 'Another reason Meta is such an amazing company is its cash generation. Last year, it generated $71.1 billion in net cash from its operations and closed out 2023 with $65.4 billion in cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities. This war chest gives it plenty of financial flexibility with regard to acquisitions and innovations.', ""Meta Platforms is also attempting to become a leader in augmented reality (AR)/virtual reality (VR), with a longer-term goal by CEO Mark Zuckerberg to be a key on-ramp to the metaverse. Though the company's investments in its Reality Labs segment are probably years away from being a meaningful percentage of total sales, Meta looks well positioned to be a leader in AR and VR."", ""Lastly, the valuation is extremely compelling when placed side-by-side with Walmart. While Meta's forward P/E of 21 might not sound like that much of a discount, its annualized earnings growth rate over the coming five years is expected to be 26%! This works out to a PEG ratio of less than 1, which signals a potentially undervalued stock-split candidate."", 'Should you invest $1,000 in Walmart right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Walmart, consider this:', 'The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\xa010 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Walmart wasn’t one of them. The 10 stocks that made the cut could produce monster returns in the coming years.', 'Stock Advisor provides investors with an easy-to-follow blueprint for success, including guidance on building a portfolio, regular updates from analysts, and two new stock picks each month.

However, with the ECC608 TrustMANAGER and keySTREAM, Microchip is revolutionizing this landscape. This innovative pairing allows for the management and updating of security credentials in the field, eliminating the constraints of static security implementations.At the heart of this technology is the ECC608 TrustMANAGER, which utilizes a secure authentication IC designed to safeguard cryptographic keys and certificates.

That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock."", ""We essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher.

The move coming as US stockpiles rose unexpectedly by 3.2 million barrels in the latest week. Joining us now is Regina Mayor, KPMG Global Head of Clients and Markets.', ""Regina, it is good to see you. So oil has been rallying. We did reach this five-month high. What explains that, Regina? What's driving that move?"", ""REGINA MAYOR: Well, the market's been remarkably able to shrug off risk. And I guess in this particular instance, they haven't been able to. So we've got escalating tensions in the Middle East. There looks like there might be a spread. That's what's really driving the big kick up now. And we're starting to see demand actually continue to increase, like manufacturing-- manufacturing data from the US was stronger than it's ever been since 2022. China's was stronger for the last six months. So those are some of the factors that are going into it."", ""We also saw January, a lot of production was down because of some of the cold weather. So I think there was an expectation that stocks would be lower, demand is going higher, geopolitics are creating a greater risk factor. So those are the things that are driving the current rally. Personally, I don't expect that to continue."", ""JULIE HYMAN: Well, that's what I was going to ask you about, Regina, you know, whether some of those factors are going to remain in place. I mean, geopolitical tensions don't seem to be necessarily abating here. But what about the other factors that you were talking about?"", 'REGINA MAYOR: Well, stocks did build as you just mentioned. And so I do think January was a little bit of an anomaly when it came to production. And you see the US driving much greater levels of production, hitting record levels of production in December. And I would anticipate that will come back.', ""And the US is becoming a much greater exporter of its hydrocarbon resources. And that's driving a lot of positivity around easing supply concerns. I don't think demand is going to necessarily dampen. So if the geopolitical tensions do not scale back somewhat, especially in the Middle East, then you could potentially see a driver that increases prices. But frankly, I'm more on the bearish side, and I'm not going to predict the a three-digit oil price anytime soon."", ""JULIE HYMAN: OK. So that was going to be my next question for you, Regina. Where do you think the cap is in this current surge that we've seen?"", ""REGINA MAYOR: Again, I go back to the market has been incredibly remarkable in its ability to shrug off risk. This has been going on for the last two years since the conflict in Russia-- or the conflict in Ukraine when Russia invaded Ukraine took place. And even with a lot of those barrels coming off the market, we're still able to increase production from other parts of the world. And we've been able to meet the burgeoning demand."", 'We reached record high global demand in 2023, greater even than pre-pandemic. And I recall during the pandemic when we were saying we had reached peak demand, and that does not necessarily seem to be the case.', ""JOSH LIPTON: We keep talking about this phenomenon with regard to US stocks as well-- equities, that is. In other words, this sort of resilience, this view that because economic growth has continued, that stocks have just continued to go up. So I guess what I'm asking is, how much is animal spirits sort of a factor here? How much speculation is happening when it comes to the oil markets? And how tenacious can that be a factor going forward?"", ""REGINA MAYOR: It's incredibly speculative. I mean, there's all kinds of factors that drive supply and demand. And I believe that the market probably has been under-representing risk in the delicate supply-demand balance that we have for global crude supplies."", ""So you could say it's irrational exuberance, like we're seeing maybe in some of the equities markets. And if that potentially comes down, you know, what does that do? But if the stocks do eventually crash, that probably means a crash in oil prices as well. So I see enough dampeners as well as the things that are being priced in right now to say, I think this is something of a blip. But again, I'm not particularly good at predicting oil price. So don't take that one to the bank."", ""JULIE HYMAN: Well, I want to ask about gasoline also, because obviously that's getting a lot of attention-- I mean, it always gets a lot of attention. But it's in a presidential election year, there are some factors going on there. And in the past when we've seen these gasoline prices creep up, we have seen some pushback from motorists, who don't want to pay especially lofty prices. What kind of dynamics are we seeing at play this time?"", ""REGINA MAYOR: Well, the public's always able to vote with their feet when it comes to gasoline consumption-- not 100% So I'm not trying to be hyperbolic about it. I understand people need to drive their cars to get to and from work and to pick up their children and take them to school and things of that nature."", ""However, they might think twice about driving over the summer holiday if gas prices reach a level that they deem unacceptable. I've seen that typically at $5 per gallon in the Southern states where gas prices tend to be lower. You do see demand destruction."", ""We're getting into summer driving season. We expect gasoline demand to continue to grow. That will drive prices up in the short term. So the extent to which it's affecting an American's pocketbook will drive how they behave this summer."", 'JULIE HYMAN: Regina, good to see you. Thanks for joining us.', 'Thanks']"

The move opens another battlefront in the fight over the future of Diablo Canyon’s twin reactors.', 'Friends of the Earth, in a complaint filed Tuesday in U.S. District Court in Los Angeles, argued that the award to plant operator Pacific Gas & Electric last year was based on an outdated, flawed analysis that failed to recognize the risk of earthquakes or other serious events.', 'The complaint called the safety assessment “grossly deficient” and accuses the Energy Department of relying on a 50-year-old environmental analysis.', '“The environmental impacts from extending the lifespan of this aging power plant at this point in time have not been adequately addressed or disclosed to the public,” the complaint said.', 'An email seeking comment was sent to the Energy Department.', 'Diablo Canyon lies on a bluff overlooking the Pacific midway between Los Angeles and San Francisco. It began operating in the mid-1980s and supplies up to 9% of the state’s electricity on any given day.', ""In 2016, PG&E, environmental groups and unions representing plant workers agreed to close the facility by 2025. But the Legislature voided the deal in 2022 after Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom reversed his position and said the power is needed to ward off blackouts as the state transitions to renewables and climate change stresses California's energy system."", ""Since then, disputes have swirled about the safety of Diablo Canyon's decades-old reactors, whether taxpayers might be saddled with hundreds of millions of dollars in additional costs and even if the electricity is needed in the age of solar and other green energy."", 'PG&E has long said the twin-domed plant is safe, an assessment endorsed by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission.', 'The Biden administration approved $1.1 billion in Energy Department funding in January. The financing came through the administration’s civil nuclear credit program, which is intended to bail out financially distressed owners or operators of nuclear power reactors as part of the administration’s effort to cut planet-warming greenhouse gas emissions in half by 2030 compared with 2005 levels.', 'PG&E has said it wants to keep the plant open to “ensure statewide electrical reliability and combat climate change” at the direction of the state.', 'The utility is seeking a 20-year extension of its federal licenses, typical in the industry, but emphasized the state would control how long the plant actually runs. A state judge has conditionally approved a blueprint to keep it operating for an additional five years, until 2030.', 'California is the birthplace of the modern environmental movement and for decades has had a fraught relationship with nuclear power. The fight over Diablo Canyon is playing out as the long-struggling nuclear industry sees a potential rebirth in the era of global warming. Nuclear power doesn’t produce carbon pollution like fossil fuels, but it leaves behind waste that can remain dangerously radioactive for centuries.']"

Everyone else had just started to copy Big Blue's business model of providing every technology solution under the sun, from servers and storage to software and consulting services. But when Ginni Rometty took over the CEO office from industry legend Sam Palmisano, it was time for a change."", ""Rometty sold or spun off most of IBM's hardware segment, ranging from laptops and desktops to storage and Unix servers. Slow-growing services were also up for grabs, leading to the creation of the stand-alone Kyndryl\xa0business out of IBM's infrastructure services arm."", ""Meanwhile, IBM refocused its mighty assets, talents, and know-how on a small selection of future growth opportunities. After eight years at the helm, Rometty handed the reins to cloud and cognitive software pioneer Arvind Krishna in 2020. Under Krishna's seasoned hand, the new and improved IBM is all about cloud computing and artificial intelligence (AI). Other tech titans can't match this company's combination of software, services, and consulting expertise, strictly focused on business-class customers."", ""And the time has finally come to take advantage of the revised strategy. AI is a hot topic right now, driving a marketwide surge of interest and investing. IBM's unshakable focus on enterprise customers may have slowed down the company's financial gains from the roaring AI frenzy, but Big Blue is entering the AI scene in a big way."", ""You don't have to take my word for it. At a recent industry conference, CFO Jim Kavanaugh sketched out IBM's plan for the next few years."", '""You\'re seeing a fundamentally different IBM today, an IBM that\'s focused on the two most transformative technology shifts, we think: hybrid cloud and generative AI,"" Kavanaugh said. ""We are extremely excited about the secular growth opportunity of generative AI. And we have repositioned IBM around what we believe are the two most transformative technologies, one being hybrid cloud and one being generative AI -- and the synergistic effect of those two.""', ""Kavanaugh sees an addressable market worth several trillion dollars a year in this explosive combination. IBM doesn't have to dominate the sector in order to pocket game-changing revenue and profits from cloud-based generative AI platforms."", ""This is where IBM's legendary consulting expertise comes into play. AI rivals such as Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) or OpenAI may have powerful generative AI systems on hand, but they lack Big Blue's decades of supporting services. So when a potential client decides to jump into the AI waters but isn't sure how to install, maintain, and use this fancy new tool, IBM will gladly put in a lot of billable hours in that supportive role."", ""How serious is IBM about this competitive advantage? Let's take a quick look at the latest round of earnings calls, for example."", ""Microsoft executives and curious financial analysts mentioned AI more than 70 times in January's second-quarter call, including 12 mentions of generative AI partner OpenAI. The concept of consulting came up exactly once, in the context of a major AI customer whose in-house consultants use AI to boost the productivity."", 'One day earlier, Google parent Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) talked about AI 82 times in its fourth-quarter call. Consulting came up once, as CEO Sundar Pichai explained how Alphabet partners with consulting giant Accenture\xa0to install and support AI services.', 'One week earlier, IBM\'s fourth-quarter call featured 43 mentions of AI by the leadership team and another 12 discussions of the Watsonx AI platform. Krishna called the consulting business ""a core driver of our value proposition for clients."" This segment brought in $20 billion of revenue in 2023, or 32% of IBM\'s total sales. If that contribution wasn\'t worthy of water-cooler talk, I don\'t know what is. Management talked about ""consulting"" on 34 occasions.', 'Big Blue stands out as a unique success story in the booming AI market -- and Wall Street is still waking up to this opportunity.', ""IBM's fourth-quarter report lit a fire under the stock, but it still trades at a serious discount to the current batch of AI-driven market darlings. For instance, Alphabet's price-to-sales and price-to-free-cash-flow ratios are about twice as generous as IBM's. Double them again and you land near Microsoft's valuation metrics. Let's not even talk about the most mind-boggling AI valuations, which make even Microsoft look cheap."", ""Fast-forward to 2027, and we might see IBM's AI-with-a-consulting-edge becoming the go-to solution for businesses, driving not just adoption but seamless integration. This move could see the company redefine industry standards and investor expectations. And in the meantime, IBM's stock is value priced."", ""So if you're itching to invest in the soaring AI market, and also looking for an affordable stock with strong growth prospects, IBM should fit the bill. IBM isn't just a value play at this threshold between two eras; it's a visionary leap into the tech sector's future."", 'Should you invest $1,000 in International Business Machines right now?', 'Before you buy stock in International Business Machines, consider this:', 'The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\xa010 best stocks for investors to buy now… and International Business Machines wasn’t one of them.

The article suggests that a significant chunk of the budget for the project is likely to be spent on semiconductors, and the goal is for the supercomputer to go online in 2028."", ""To put things in perspective, Stargate could be 100 times more expensive than what it costs to build a massive data center right now, and the projected outlay on the project would be more than triple Microsoft's capital spending last year. There is a solid way for investors to capitalize on this potentially massive AI investment from Microsoft -- Arm Holdings (NASDAQ: ARM)."", ""Arm Holdings is a British chip designer that licenses its intellectual property to semiconductor companies and original equipment manufacturers, which then customize Arm's instruction sets to manufacture chips to their specifications and requirements. Its IP is used for manufacturing central processing units (CPUs), graphics processing units (GPUs), neural processing units (NPUs), and interconnect technologies."", ""According to Arm, more than 70% of the global population uses products based on its intellectual property. That's not surprising: Almost all the smartphones in the world run on Arm-based processors, while 50% of CPUs are made using its instruction sets. The company has two sources of revenue: licensing and royalties. It receives licensing fees from customers after selling its intellectual property to them. Customers also pay Arm royalties for every chip they ship that contains its technology."", 'Microsoft\'s new endeavor could be a tailwind for Arm\'s business. In November, Microsoft introduced its first in-house custom AI CPU, the Azure Cobalt. This custom CPU is based on the Arm Neoverse CSS platform. Arm says that Cobalt can ""tackle the biggest and most complex challenges the infrastructure will face from AI to sustainability.""', ""Tech sector news site The Next Platform predicts that Microsoft will be looking to reduce its reliance on the likes of Nvidia by deploying future generations of the Cobalt processor for Stargate. That wouldn't be surprising, as custom AI processors not only save cloud companies money on capital costs and electricity expenses but also deliver better performance. Microsoft, for instance, said it witnessed jumps in performance of up to 40% after deploying the first generation of Cobalt chips."", ""Considering the huge amount of power that a supercomputer the size of Stargate would need, Microsoft is likely to pack a considerable amount of power-efficient custom chips such as Cobalt into it instead of power-hungry GPUs. As a result, Arm's AI-related revenue is likely to get a shot in the arm as Microsoft builds its ambitious supercomputer."", ""The good part is that Arm is already benefiting from the growing adoption of AI chips, but Microsoft's big project could provide yet another catalyst that leads to stronger top-line growth than analysts are anticipating."", ""The current consensus estimates are for Arm's earnings to increase at an annualized rate of nearly 45% for the next five years. If that proves accurate, its bottom line will jump to about $7.63 per share after five years (using its fiscal 2024 projected earnings of $1.19 per share as the base). If we multiply that projected earnings figure with the Nasdaq-100's forward earnings multiple of 27.3 (using the index as a proxy for tech stocks), we get a projected stock price for Arm of $208 in five years -- 69% above current levels."", 'However, its earnings could be even stronger on the back of Stargate-driven demand from Microsoft, which is why investors looking to buy an AI stock would do well to buy Arm before it surges higher.', 'Should you invest $1,000 in Arm Holdings right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Arm Holdings, consider this:', 'The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\xa010 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Arm Holdings wasn’t one of them.

After notching 75% gains in roughly 15 months, is Microsoft stock still a buy? Let's see what the data says."", ""It's easy to suggest that Microsoft was simply in the right place at the right time, but that would ignore the hard work going on behind the scenes. While generative AI first captured the spotlight early last year, Microsoft bet on the technology much earlier, investing $1 billion in AI start-up OpenAI back in 2019. Thus began a long-term partnership that helped take the technology to the next level."", 'The collaboration yielded a system that used supercomputers to train the large language models (LLMs) that underpin generative AI. The resulting bots could complete a variety of impressive tasks: generate frighteningly accurate images based on voice prompts, answer complicated questions, and complete the coding on an unfinished software app.', 'Microsoft decided to test the utility of this last bot within GitHub, a company it acquired in 2018. The platform, a place where developers worked together on software apps and shared code, was the perfect testing ground for such a tool. Despite its imperfections, developers flocked to the GitHub Copilot after its release in late 2021.', 'This success acted as a springboard for other Copilots that followed. In late 2022, Microsoft used a similar blueprint to train new versions of Copilot for each application in its Office Suite of workplace productivity tools. When Microsoft released a preview for public testing, Copilot contained ""guardrails"" or rules to limit incorrect responses. Furthermore, when Copilot responded to a query, it provided two responses, and testing partners were asked to choose the preferred response, further honing the tool\'s capabilities.', ""The results were so successful that Microsoft increased its stake in OpenAI to $13 billion by early 2023, accelerating the AI revolution that started with OpenAI's ChatGPT release."", 'Microsoft has since released a suite of industry- and job-specific Copilots, including those designed specifically for users in sales, service, and finance roles, with more on the drawing board.', 'CEO Satya Nadella has reported getting rave reviews from Copilot users. ""Customers tell us that once they use Copilot, they can\'t imagine work without it.""', ""It's too early to tell just how much this foray into AI will be worth to Microsoft, but that hasn't stopped Wall Street's best and brightest from trying. The company charges users $30 per person per month for Copilot for Microsoft 365. Analysts from Piper Sandler estimate this could generate incremental revenue of $10 billion by 2026. Macquarie Research suggests that Copilot could generate $14 billion in revenue in its first full year alone -- and that's if just 10% of Microsoft's enterprise customers use the product. Analysts at Evercore are much more bullish, calculating that Copilot could add as much as $100 billion in incremental revenue by 2027."", 'Microsoft stock is currently selling for roughly 36 times forward earnings, which is a premium compared to a multiple of 28 for the S&P 500 index. While no one knows for sure just how much the company will reap from its Copilot strategy, the bump in revenue will likely be substantial.', 'Be that as it may, the evidence suggests that Microsoft stock is still a reasonable buy, even near its all-time high.', 'Where to invest $1,000 right now', 'When our analyst team has a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

According to Bloomberg, the company is going to transition a number of employees who worked on the car to its AI division, at a time when Wall Street is looking for signs that the iPhone maker is taking the generative AI trend seriously. Killing the project also means that Apple will avoid what could have been a costly rollout amid a slowdown in electric vehicle sales in the US.', 'Finally, Meta announced during its first quarter earnings report that it will begin paying a quarterly dividend of $0.50 per share and authorized an additional $50 billion for stock buybacks, sending shares of the company skyrocketing 38% year to date and 131% in the last 12 months.', 'Things weren’t all good for tech in the first quarter. Case in point, the FTC announced it is launching an inquiry into Alphabet, Amazon (AMZN), and Microsoft’s (MSFT) investments in generative AI firms, including Anthropic and OpenAI. Alphabet and Amazon have both invested billions in Anthropic, while Microsoft has pumped billions into OpenAI.', 'The FTC says the move will “help the agency deepen enforcers understanding of the investments and partnerships formed between generative AI developers and cloud service providers.”', 'The upshot? The FTC is keeping its eye on Big Tech’s efforts to capture as much of the AI market as possible, and whether those companies are grabbing too much power.', 'It’s not just the FTC keeping its eyes on tech companies either. The European Union’s competition watchdog, the European Commission (EC), is looking into whether Apple, Google, and Meta are complying with the bloc’s Digital Markets Act (DMA).', 'The DMA is meant to force large tech companies to open up their services to prevent them from dominating specific markets. The EC isn’t so sure they’re playing ball, though, and is looking into whether they’re complying or not.', 'The hits kept coming for Google during the quarter after it botched the launch of its flagship generative AI-powered Gemini image generator. Users found the app produced images of multicultural Nazis, among other things, forcing the company to pull the app.', 'Congress also got in on the action, looking to, yet again, take down TikTok, with the House passing legislation that would force parent company ByteDance to sell the social network or keep Apple and Google from offering it in their app stores. The Senate still has to take action on the measure, but First Amendment concerns could prevent any ban from sticking.', 'Nothing is as bad as these stories though: Up top, the Department of Justice’s antitrust lawsuit against Apple. The DOJ claims Apple is boxing out competition and hurting developers, and ultimately consumers, by keeping a tight grip on its App Store and hardware.', 'According to the suit, Apple locks competitors out from being able to access features that would let them take on the Apple Wallet and Apple Watch. Apple refutes the claims, but the suit could take years to wrap up and may prove to be a distraction for its future.', 'Tesla (TSLA) CEO Elon Musk filed a lawsuit of his own against OpenAI, the company he co-founded, claiming that the AI firm has abandoned its original mission to create AI technologies that benefit humanity. Musk says that OpenAI is more focused on profits and is a subsidiary of Microsoft. OpenAI has fired back, refuting Musk’s claims and saying that he’s more or less upset that he missed the boat on the company’s explosive growth.', ""Finally, there’s the electric vehicle market. Sales of EVs are slowing in the US as subsidies for certain models dry up, and sky-high interest rates are making it harder for consumers to purchase models. Then there's lingering range anxiety about a car running out of power mid-drive. The general thinking is that EVs will eventually become the dominant type of vehicle on the road in the next decade or so, but for now, the jump in sales seen over the past few years is falling flat."", 'It’s still early in the year — heck, baseball season just started, though my Mets are already in the basement.

It's one of the world's largest real estate investment trusts (REITs), and its tenants include large retailers like Walgreens, 7-Eleven, Dollar General, Dollar Tree, and Walmart. Many of those retailers are resistant to recessions, and some of them even thrive during economic downturns."", 'As a REIT, Realty Income is obligated to pay out at least 90% of its taxable earnings as dividends to its investors. And as a net lease REIT, its tenants are responsible for covering most of their own expenses -- including maintenance costs, property taxes, and insurance fees. That simple business model enables the company to generate plenty of cash to cover its monthly dividend.', ""Despite all those strengths, Realty Income's stock has declined 23% over the past two years as investors fretted over rising interest rates and some challenges for its top tenants. Nevertheless, I believe that pullback is a buying opportunity for five simple reasons."", ""The Federal Reserve is widely expected to reduce interest rates over the next two years. That's great news for Realty Income since high interest rates make it tougher to buy properties and make its dividends less attractive."", 'During Realty Income\'s latest conference call in February, CEO Sumit Roy said the company expected the Fed to ""start cutting"" interest rates in ""six to seven months."" Roy also said it would be ""first in line to react"" to those rate cuts.', ""Meanwhile, its declining stock price boosted its forward dividend yield to 5.7%. That's higher than the 10-year Treasury's 4.2% yield and most CD yields. That widening gap should drive more income investors back to the REIT."", ""Realty Income's three largest tenants are Dollar General, Walgreens, and Dollar Tree (which also owns Family Dollar). Those three tenants accounted for 3.8%, 3.8%, and 3.3%, respectively, of its annualized rent in 2023. That's why it was alarming when two of those retailers started closing hundreds of stores. Walgreens plans to close up to 700 stores in the U.S., while Dollar Tree plans to shutter 970 of its Family Dollar stores."", ""But that's only about 8% of Walgreens' stores and 12% of Family Dollar's stores -- and Realty Income doesn't own all those properties. If we do the math, those gradual closures should only impact a sliver of Realty Income's rental income from those two tenants."", ""That's significant, but its other major tenant, Dollar General, could offset some of the pressure by opening 800 new stores this year. Those store closures will also occur in multi-year phases as the leases expire -- so Realty Income should still have plenty of time to replace those tenants and maintain its high occupancy rate."", 'Realty Income ended 2023 with a high occupancy rate of 98.6%, and that ratio has never dropped below 96% over the past three decades. It recently expanded its portfolio by merging with Spirit Realty and now owns 15,450 properties.', ""Realty Income's adjusted funds from operations (FFO) rose at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 25% from 2018 to 2023, even as the pandemic and inflationary headwinds rattled many of its top tenants. Its adjusted FFO per share -- which is a clearer metric for a REIT's growth than its earnings per share (EPS) -- increased at a CAGR of 5%."", ""Realty Income has paid consecutive monthly dividends ever since its founding in 1969. It's also raised its dividends a whopping 124 times since its public debut in 1994."", 'It only paid out 71% of its free cash flow (FCF) over the past 12 months -- so it still has plenty of room to raise its monthly dividends. That makes it a great stock for dividend growth investors to buy and hold.', ""Realty Income might initially look expensive with a price-to-earnings ratio of 43, but REITs are usually valued relative to their FFO per share. By that metric, the stock looks historically cheap at just 13 times the company's adjusted FFO per share in 2023."", 'Back when Realty Income hit its all-time high of $68.54 on Aug. 15, 2022, it was trading at 17 times its adjusted FFO for 2022. Therefore, it makes sense for investors to buy the stock right now while the near-term concerns about interest rates and the store closures at Walgreens and Family Dollar are still compressing its valuation.', 'Should you invest $1,000 in Realty Income right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Realty Income, consider this:', 'The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\xa010 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Realty Income wasn’t one of them.

(NASDAQ:PAYX) Q3 2024 Earnings Call Transcript April 2, 2024', 'Paychex, Inc. beats earnings expectations. Reported EPS is $1.38, expectations were $1.36. Paychex, Inc. isn’t one of the 30 most popular stocks among hedge funds at the end of the third quarter (see the details here).', ""Operator: Good day, everyone, and welcome to today's Paychex Third Quarter Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, you'll have an opportunity to ask questions during the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Please note this call is being recorded. And it is now my pleasure to turn today's call over to President and Chief Executive Officer, John Gibson. Please go ahead."", ""John Gibson: Thank you, Mike. Thank you, everyone for joining our discussion today on the Paychex third quarter fiscal year 2024 earnings release. Joining me today is Bob Schrader, our Chief Financial Officer. This morning before the market opened, we released our financial results for the third quarter. You can access our earnings release on our Investor Relations website. Our Form 10-Q will be filed with the SEC within the next day. This teleconference is being broadcast over the Internet and will be archived and available on our website for approximately 90 days. I'm going to start the call today with an update on the business highlights for the third quarter and then turn it over to Bob for a financial update and then of course, we'll be happy to take your questions."", 'We delivered solid results in the third quarter and the first nine months of the current fiscal year. Total revenue growth of 4% in the third quarter reflected a lower contribution for our employee retention tax credit or ERTC service as compared with the prior year period. This is consistent with our previously communicated expectations that ERTC revenue would become a headwind in the second half of the current fiscal year. Excluding this impact, our total revenue growth accelerated to 7% in the quarter, while our new client volumes remained solid and in line, and both client and revenue retentions were in line with our expectations. Several factors including our decision to wind down the ERTC program based upon the recent legislative developments on Capitol Hill, continued moderation of employment growth within our client bases and slightly lower realized rates all combined to create headwind, a larger headwind than what we had anticipated in the quarter.', ""With the end of the ERTC program, we are now officially in the post pandemic era at Paychex, and I will tell you I am very pleased with how our teams have performed during these past several years. We put nearly $90 billion of financial aid into the hands of our clients, and based upon an analysis by MIT, we estimate that we save over 300,000 small business jobs. While these pandemic error programs are not part of our normal reoccurring revenue product strategy or our business model at Paychex, they were certainly consistent with our purpose. And that's simply to help businesses succeed. And I believe that we are a better company today than when we entered the pandemic four years ago. We are winning in the marketplace, and our long proven a recurring revenue growth formula still holds true."", 'And this post pandemic and digitally driven era for the company, focused client growth, value-based price realization, increased product penetration, and opportunistic acquisitions are still the key pillars of the Paychex growth strategy. We are exiting the pandemic era with an even greater focus on our purpose, more opportunities to impact our clients and their employees, and with an even stronger reputation as a trusted advisor to small and mid-sized business owners. Despite the headwinds in the quarter, we delivered 7% growth in diluted earnings per share, and expanded operating margins, due to our longstanding tradition of expense discipline. As one of the best operators in the business, we continue to demonstrate our ability to deliver on earnings in uncertain times, and still make the necessary strategic investments to drive long-term profitable growth.', ""Our culture of expense management along with investments we've made the past several years in digitization and enhanced sales and operational excellence capabilities have positioned us well for future profitable growth as well. The macroeconomic and labor market remains challenging for small mid-size businesses, a tight job market for qualified workers reduce access to affordable growth capital and inflationary pressures continue to be headwinds for small businesses. Our small business employment watch continues to show moderation in both job growth and wage inflation. But however, a relatively stable macro environment, the softening in hiring we started to see in the second quarter continued in the third quarter. There is more choppiness in hiring across all customer segments and industries now."", ""Our clients tell us they still can't find qualified employees and are not willing to hire just anyone at higher wage rates, especially in areas with recent minimum wage increases and aggressive legislative changes. The demand for our HR technology and advisory solutions remains robust and the volumes of new clients added in the quarter were strong. We continue to deliver value for our customers as seen on our revenue retention results, which remain above pre-pandemic levels. Client retention for the third quarter was also in line with pre-pandemic levels and both revenue and HR outsourcing work site employee retention remains at record levels. As we continue to focus our resources on acquiring and retaining high value clients. Our sustained high revenue retention demonstrates that our value proposition and our market leadership remain intact."", ""The fundamentals of Paychex are same. I'd like to highlight the success in our PEO business specifically, which has continued to gain momentum with strong results during the first nine months of the fiscal year. We finished the quarter with strong results in sales, retention and insurance enrollment. We have continued to see a shift back towards the PEO offerings both outside and inside our client base. This shift mix has a long-term positive impact on the customer lifetime value in our model, particularly as clients attach insurance benefits. AI and related technology investments are also key areas of focus in our industry and something that, as many of you know, we've been focused on for many years. We are proud to announce that we successfully implemented in the quarter several additional innovative AI models that significantly improved results for Paychex and our clients."", ""Leveraging innovative technology and advanced analytics has allowed us to gain deeper insights into prospects and client behavior, their preferences, and their growing needs. Last month, we announced that Beaumont Vance has joined the company as our Senior Vice President of Data Analytics and AI. In this newly created role, he will be responsible for refining and executing the company's data strategy, including the use of business intelligence, advanced analytics, and AI driven automation to drive both improved business performance and enhanced customer value. We are excited to have Beaumont on Board to help us capture the full value of our vast data assets. I want to thanks to the hard work of our more than 16,000 employees and their focus on our company's values."", ""Paychex continues to be recognized for both what we do and more importantly in my opinion, how we do it? We are proud to be recognized for the 16th time by Ethisphere, as one of the world's Most Ethical Companies in their recent annual list. Paychex was also recently recognized by Fortune Magazine as one of the Most Innovative Companies for the second consecutive year. These recognitions and the many product and service awards that we have received in the past year and over the decades is a testament to the strength of our business model, culture and the commitment to invest in our business and our employees to deliver long-term value for our customers and investors. I'm very proud of how our employees have delivered for our customers, for each other, for our communities, and for our shareholders throughout the pandemic area."", ""We exit at this period in Paychex history, more focused and determined to be the digitally driven HR leader in our industry, and we are even better positioned to capture the opportunities in the markets we serve. I'll now turn it over to Bob to give you a brief update on our financial results for the quarter."", ""Bob Schrader: Thanks, John, and good morning, everyone. I'd like to start by reminding everyone that today's commentary will contain certain forward-looking statements that refer to future events, and therefore, involve some risks. In addition, I will periodically refer to some non-GAAP measures, like adjusted diluted earnings per share. I'd refer you to our press release for our customary disclosures around those metrics. I'll start with a summary of our third quarter and year-to-date financial results and then provide an update on our fiscal '24 outlook, and as promised too many of you on the phone, I will share some preliminary thoughts around fiscal '25. Total revenue for the quarter increased 4% to $1.4 billion, which reflects a lower contribution from our ERTC as compared to the prior year quarter."", 'Management Solutions revenue increased 2% to $1 billion. This was primarily driven by growth in the number of clients served across our suite of HCM solutions and increased product penetration, and that was offset by the decline in our ERTC revenue. And as we disclosed in the press release, that has impacted the growth by about 300 basis points. PEO and Insurance Solutions revenue increased 8% to $346 million, that was driven by higher average worksite employees and an increase in our PEO and Insurance revenues. Our PEO saw continued momentum in worksite employee growth and medical plan participant volumes during the third quarter. Interest on funds held for clients increased 25% to $44 million, primarily due to higher average interest rates.', ""Total expenses increased 3% to $790 million. Expense growth was attributable to higher compensation costs and PEO direct insurance costs related to the higher average worksite employees as well as the higher Insurance revenues during the quarter. Operating income increased 6% to $650 million with an operating margin for the quarter of 45.1%. That represents about 80 basis points of margin expansion over the prior year period. I would like to highlight that margin expansion is despite the ERTC headwind that we just called out, we were still able to deliver really strong margin expansion in the quarter. And I think as many of you know, ERTC is pretty much like interest rates, it's pretty much all margin. Both diluted earnings per share and adjusted diluted earnings per share increased 7% to $1.38."", ""I'll quickly summarize our results for the year-to-date period. Total revenue grew 5% to $4 billion. Management Solutions revenue increased 4% to $2.9 billion. PEO and Insurance Solutions increased 7% to $939 million. And interest on funds held for clients increased 44% to $108 million. Total expenses for the first 9 months grew 4% to $2.3 billion. And our operating margins for the first 9 months of the year were 42.5%, and that's a 70 basis point expansion over the prior year period. Diluted earnings per share and adjusted diluted earnings per share both increased 9% year-over-year to $3.62 and $3.60, respectively. I'll now give you a quick overview of our financial position. As many of you know, we maintain a strong financial position with high-quality cash flows and earnings generation."", ""Our balance for cash, restricted cash and total corporate investments was $1.8 billion. And our total borrowings were approximately $817 million as of the end of the quarter. Cash flow from operations for the first 9 months was $1.7 billion, that's up 30% compared to the same period last year. That was driven primarily by higher net income and fluctuations in working capital. And we returned a total of $1.1 billion to shareholders through the first 9 months of the year. That includes $963 million in dividends and $169 million of share repurchases. And our 12-month rolling return on equity remains robust at 47%. I'll now turn to our updated guidance for the current fiscal year. This outlook assumes the current macro environment, which obviously had some level of uncertainty."", ""We have revised our guidance on certain measures based on performance this quarter and this also reflects the impact of our decision to wind down our ERTC service based on recently proposed legislation. I just want to pause there from my prepared remarks to provide a little bit more color on ERTC. I think many of you guys are aware that there is bipartisan legislation out there that would end the ERTC program retro to January 31 of this year. I think it's past the House. It hasn't yet passed the Senate, but that does create a level of uncertainty around ERTC. We continue to sell it in the month of February. We made a decision based on that level of uncertainty to stop recognizing the revenue on ERTC subject to -- or subsequent to January 31 and we've essentially removed it from the forecast in Q4."", ""And so that's part of what you see as it relates to the impact to the quarter and also impacts the guidance the updated guidance that I'm about to give you for the year. Management Solutions is now expected to grow in the range of 3.5% to 4%. We previously had guided to the lower end of the 5% to 6% range. PEO and Insurance is still expected to grow in the range of 7% to 9%, although we now expect that it will be more towards the lower end of that range. Interest on funds held for clients is still expected to be in the range of $140 million to $150 million. Total revenue is now expected to grow in the range of 5% to 6%. Our prior guidance was 6% to 7%. Other income net is expected to be income in the range of $40 million to $45 million, and this is raised from the previous guidance of $35 million to $40 million."", 'Our guidance for operating margins and effective tax rate are unchanged, although we still do anticipate being at the high end of the operating margin guidance range, which was 41% to 42%. And adjusted diluted earnings per share is still expected to grow in the range of 10% to 11%. Now let me just provide a little bit of color on the fourth quarter. We are currently anticipating total revenue growth to be approximately 5% in Q4. We expect the ERTC headwind to Management Solutions growth in the fourth quarter to be similar to what it was in the third quarter. And we would also expect the operating margins to be around 40% in the quarter. We are currently in the middle of our annual budget process and working on our expectations for the next fiscal year.', ""We obviously will provide formal guidance like we normally do at the end of the Q4 when we get to that call. However, I will share some preliminary thoughts and I will emphasize the word preliminary around what we're expecting for fiscal '25. On a preliminary basis, we would expect total revenue growth to be consistent with the fourth quarter growth rate. And as a reminder, as I just told you, that would be in the 5% range. And this does include a headwind from ERTC of approximately 2%. I mean, ERTC, for all intents and purposes, is 0 going forward. I know what that headwind is going to be. I know what the dollar amount was this year, and it will be approximately a 2% headwind to revenue growth for FY '25 and that is assumed in the 5% range number that I gave you."", ""And then despite this headwind, we are committed to delivering operating margin expansion in fiscal '25. We are still going through the annual budget process, working through the details. We'll provide more color as we get to the end of the year. Obviously, this is based on our current assumptions, which we are still working through. Those may change, but we'll update you again when we get to the fourth quarter. I will refer you to our investor slides on our website for additional information. And with that, I'll turn it back over to John."", ""John Gibson: Okay. Thank you, Bob. Mike, we'll now open it up for questions."", 'See also 15 Best Places to Retire in Illinois and 20 Fastest Developing Countries in 2024.', 'To continue reading the Q&A session, please click here.']"

This is quite a puzzle, and suggests there might be something temporarily buoying the share price.

Whereas the share price return only reflects the change in the share price, the TSR includes the value of dividends (assuming they were reinvested) and the benefit of any discounted capital raising or spin-off. So for companies that pay a generous dividend, the TSR is often a lot higher than the share price return.

The energy drink upstart's stock is up an incredible 5,730% in the last five years, meaning anyone who bought $10,000 worth of shares is now sitting on $583,000 in wealth. Through rapid revenue growth, margin expansion, and investor excitement, Celsius has become one of the premier growth stocks of the 21st century."", 'The big question for investors today is: What will the company do over the next five years?', 'Celsius became popular a few years back as it counter-positioned itself versus the energy drink giants Monster Beverage and Red Bull. Both brands -- rightly or wrongly -- are seen as unhealthy drinks focused on branding to extreme sports like skateboarding, motor racing, and surfing. This has been highly profitable but does not cater to a large swath of the energy drink target market.', ""Seeing this, Celsius branded its beverages as healthy, calorie-light, and for the everyday person focused on exercise. This branding push drove further expansion of the energy drink market, to Celsius's benefit. Over the last five years, Celsius sales are up 2,300%, with most of the gains coming from North America. It generated $1.3 billion of revenue in 2023 compared to under $100 million a few years back."", 'It now commands the third market share position in energy drinks in North America, with Monster and Red Bull as the two leaders. Profits are soaring. Operating income hit $266 million in 2023, which shows the fantastic unit economics of premium-packaged beverages such as Celsius.', ""One of the smartest moves Celsius made was letting competitor PepsiCo take a stake in its operations. In return, Celsius was able to hop on the Pepsi distribution network in North America. This is an underrated aspect of any successful consumer goods brand. Not only do they get better negotiating power with merchants, but better shelf space at the grocery store and gas station. It is hard to quantify, but the Pepsi distribution likely had a large effect on Celsius's growth in recent quarters."", 'Celsius is hoping to repeat this magic formula in international markets. It is going to other English-speaking markets like Ireland, the United Kingdom, Australia, and New Zealand. All of these markets were only launched in 2024.', 'With around 100 million people in these various countries -- a lot of whom have similar exercise and fitness hobbies as Celsius consumers in the United States -- I think Celsius has a chance to do quite well overseas. Over the long run, investors should hope this becomes a global brand like Red Bull and Monster.', ""Over the next five years, I expect more strong revenue growth from Celsius. Investors shouldn't expect 2,300% growth, but there is still plenty of room for Celsius to expand in North America, and especially internationally. The global energy drink market is expected to reach $100 billion in global sales soon. At $1.3 billion in revenue, Celsius is still a minnow in the global pond."", 'If the company can put up 300% revenue cumulative revenue growth over the next five years, it will be doing $5 billion in annual sales by 2028. At a 25% profit margin, that equates to $1.25 billion in annual profits. Today, Celsius has a market cap of $19.3 billion. Comparing this forward earnings figure, it is clear that Celsius still has a lot of this growth priced in.', 'However, if the company is able to reach $5 billion in annual sales and maintain its strong profit margins, I think Celsius stock will be higher five years from now. This is one of the fastest-growing companies in the world, and I see no reason to bet against that continuing for the foreseeable future.', 'Should you invest $1,000 in Celsius right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Celsius, consider this:', 'The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\xa010 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Celsius wasn’t one of them.

However, stock prices are usually driven by a company’s financial performance over the long term, which in this case looks quite promising. Particularly, we will be paying attention to Monster Beverage's  ROE today."", ""Return on equity or ROE is a key measure used to assess how efficiently a company's management is utilizing the company's capital. In simpler terms, it measures the profitability of a company in relation to shareholder's equity."", ' See our latest analysis for Monster Beverage ', 'The formula for return on equity is:', ""Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' Equity"", 'So, based on the above formula, the ROE for Monster Beverage is:', '20% = US$1.6b ÷ US$8.2b (Based on the trailing twelve months to December 2023).', ""The 'return' is the profit over the last twelve months. Another way to think of that is that for every $1 worth of equity, the company was able to earn $0.20 in profit."", 'Thus far, we have learned that ROE measures how efficiently a company is generating its profits. We now need to evaluate how much profit the company reinvests or ""retains"" for future growth which then gives us an idea about the growth potential of the company. Generally speaking, other things being equal, firms with a high return on equity and profit retention, have a higher growth rate than firms that don’t share these attributes.', ""At first glance, Monster Beverage seems to have a decent ROE. Further, the company's ROE is similar to the industry average of 18%. Consequently, this likely laid the ground for the decent growth of 7.0% seen over the past five years by Monster Beverage."", ""We then performed a comparison between Monster Beverage's net income growth with the industry, which revealed that the company's growth is similar to the average industry growth of 7.1% in the same 5-year period."", 'Earnings growth is an important metric to consider when valuing a stock.

', ""Monster Beverage doesn't pay any dividend, meaning that all of its profits are being reinvested in the business, which explains the fair bit of earnings growth the company has seen."", ""In total, we are pretty happy with Monster Beverage's performance. Particularly, we like that the company is reinvesting heavily into its business, and at a high rate of return. Unsurprisingly, this has led to an impressive earnings growth.

The product got Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval, but the U.S. International Trade Commission (ITC) later ruled that IQOS infringes on two patents held by British American Tobacco.', 'In 2022, Altria and Philip Morris ended their agreement, giving Philip Morris commercialization rights to IQOS in the U.S., starting in April 2024, which explains the timing of its launch in Austin.

Altria dominates the U.S. market as Marlboro has roughly 50% market share in cigarettes and it's bet on NJOY as its alternative to smoking."", ""Altria doesn't yet break out results for NJOY, but IQOS is designed to take market share from traditional cigarettes with a less harmful product, so Marlboro sales in the U.S. are also at risk."", ""If the product does catch on in the U.S., it's likely to impact broader demand for cigarettes, much as Juul posed a threat in its heyday."", ""PMI believes it can gain a 10% share of the U.S. tobacco and heated-tobacco unit volume around 2030, which would be enough to make a dent in Altria's performance."", 'If Philip Morris is successful with IQOS in the U.S., the tobacco stock is also likely to respond favorably as the U.S. represents a $143.6 billion market for nicotine products.', 'Should you invest $1,000 in Philip Morris International right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Philip Morris International, consider this:', 'The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\xa010 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Philip Morris International wasn’t one of them.

We’ve seen this happen over the past few days with the reaction to comments given by Sharmin Mossavar-Rahmani, chief investment officer of Goldman Sachs Asset & Wealth Management, in a recent Wall Street Journal interview.', 'I’m not going to add to the criticism here, satisfying as that may be. Instead, I’m going to try to defend her statements. To be clear, I deeply disagree with most of them – but I also believe that better understanding opposing views makes us stronger advocates for crypto’s potential. Plus, it brings down the irritation level, which is good for overall well-being. And it’s a fun mental exercise.', 'Noelle Acheson is the former head of research at CoinDesk and Genesis Trading, and host of the CoinDesk Markets Daily podcast. This article is excerpted from her Crypto Is Macro Now newsletter, which focuses on the overlap between the shifting crypto and macro landscapes. These opinions are hers, and nothing she writes should be taken as investment advice.', 'Let’s start with the bigger picture and some background.', 'First, Mossavar-Rahmani has an impressive investment pedigree – including 31 years at Goldman Sachs – that can’t have been easy, and deserves respect.', 'Second, she does not represent all of Goldman Sachs, which has about 40,000 employees around the world. She is the head of the Asset & Wealth Management Division, which is distinct from Sales & Trading and Investment Banking, both of which are involved in the crypto ecosystem.', 'Third, some crypto media outlets are shrieking that Goldman Sachs is now “under pressure” or “facing heat” because of Ms. Mossavar-Rahmani’s comments. I very much doubt that Goldman Sachs cares about crypto outrage, and its wealth management clients can find crypto exposure elsewhere, if they want it.', 'Yet, since her voice does carry weight among investment managers, especially those looking for an excuse to not bother learning about crypto assets, her statements in a Wall Street Journal interview deserve some discussion.', 'In order of appearance:', 'As I stressed above, by “we” she does not mean Goldman Sachs, just the Asset & Management Division.', 'An easy reaction here is to scoff at her limited understanding of digital assets, because obviously they are an “investment asset class” in that they trade on active markets, and people invest in them. But it turns out that the official definition of the term can vary. ChatGPT’s definition coincides with many others I looked up:', '“A group of financial instruments that have similar financial characteristics, are subject to the same laws and regulations, and are typically traded in the same financial markets.”', 'It could be that Ms. Mossavar-Rahmani was referring to the lack of regulatory standards around crypto assets, at least in the U.S. If that second prong is indeed part of Goldman Sachs’ definition, then crypto assets do not fit. For now, anyway.', 'Also, “similar financial characteristics” is a bit of a stretch. Stablecoins are very different from BTC, which, in turn, is very different from AVAX, BONK and a long list of others.', 'We should bear in mind that she could be speaking about the category characteristics and not about whether or not crypto is investable.', 'This one is easy to take strong exception to, because we all know that you don’t have to have specific values in mind to believe something will go up or down. We also all know that you cannot accurately value crypto assets, for too many reasons to go into here. But there is no shortage of bulls and bears. So, obviously and provably false, right?', 'Hmm. For now, let’s try and put ourselves in Mossavar-Rahmani’s shoes. She runs an investment advisor division, one that is subject to considerable scrutiny and bureaucracy. She didn’t survive over 31 years at a particularly cutthroat organization by taking hard-to-explain risks with other people’s money. Old-school investment advisors need to be able to justify decisions to their clients, they need to “show their work” in case an investment goes badly. If her team can’t assign a model-based value to BTC, they can’t make buy or sell recommendations.', 'Most of us don’t have Goldman Sachs-level constraints. For me, “up” is good enough, and I have a ballpark number at which I might take some profits, based on “feelz.” Other investment advisors I’ve spoken to have come up with target levels, but they’re not based on any validated method.', 'I will allow myself the observation that Goldman Sachs has many very smart investment analysts who surely can come up with a justifiable model. Other big-name firms have done so, and even if there is little agreement, what matters is the reasoning. Leaving that task aside, I think we have a right to expect more from a firm that has styled itself as a pillar of Wall Street. That there is no “official” model seems like lazy thinking.', 'But, Mossavar-Rahmani’s job is to play it safe. In that context, her comment is not out of line.', 'Okay, this one is really hard to defend. Crypto assets offer a wide range of services and use cases, which have value. Even if we narrow the discussion to BTC, it clearly has value for those struggling with currency depreciation or limited financial access.', 'But it turns out that “value” is a very misunderstood word, even among investment professionals. Most of us assume that the concept has to do with utility, appreciation, satisfaction, belonging, and a host of other touchy-feely benefits. Art has “value,” so do flowers and friendships.', 'But, maybe, Mossavar-Rahmani was referring to the “assigned value” we looked at in the previous section. Maybe she meant that if there is no established model spitting out a number, there is no value?', 'Nope, I give up. This one is indefensible and demonstrates a lack of understanding which I can only attribute to laziness since no-one is doubting her intelligence – “absolutely” no value?? “In any shape or form”? Sigh. I tried.', 'In this one, actually, she’s kinda largely right. I would definitely suggest adding a qualifier – “some of the main decisions end up being,” or “the main decisions on some networks can end up being.” But, on the whole, I agree that “decentralization” is an often misused word.', 'Then again, “decentralization” is not a binary condition. There are varying degrees. And many networks are gradually working towards greater decentralization, as they promised.', 'Now we come to what is possibly the most revealing quote from the interview.', 'Goldman Sachs has a long history of not recommending gold, and one theory is that it is because the investment banking division can’t make money issuing gold, whereas they do make a lot of money helping firms issue stocks and bonds. I’m not sure I buy that, but it is extraordinary to see a large investment manager ignore such a significant asset.', 'Perhaps it’s because gold also does not spin off any concrete “value”? Gold doesn’t have any cash flow or dividends. And, if it doesn’t have any concrete value, how can advisors be bearish or bullish, right? And does gold actually “create” value, does it make anything, does it spin off a yield? No.', 'I think this statement reveals much about the others. It highlights Mossavar-Rahmani’s definition of “value”, as something that needs to be created. It could be that, for her, value requires a concrete output.', 'It also highlights her limited understanding of how crypto assets work. Many do have concrete output. And pretty much all are possible to hold and store.', 'I’m tempted to point out this comment also suggests a limited view on gold investment, as few institutional or high-net-worth gold investors actually hold their own bars.', 'But, stepping back, the point of this exercise was to show that not all crypto critics are wrong about everything, and it’s useful to understand exactly where the barriers to acceptance stand. It’s also useful to acknowledge that conflicting views make a market, and that they don’t actually matter much in the longer term.', 'Even more important, it’s satisfying to think of all the people we personally know who also rejected crypto concepts at first. Smart, educated people steeped in financial lore, who eventually decided to put in the work to better understand what we see – and they all eventually changed their mind.', 'Maybe Mossavar-Rahmani will change her mind one day, too. Or maybe not. It doesn’t matter. If our once-skeptical friends can approach our viewpoint with an open mind, then we should try to approach our critics with the same. At the very least, it will help us better understand just where we need to focus our explaining efforts.']"

Of this, IBIT and FBTC have accumulated over $17 billion and $10 billion, respectively—with the latter being the fastest ETF in history to reach this milestone.', 'Moreover, while Mossavar-Rahmani may publicly condemn investing in crypto, in January CoinDesk reported that Goldman Sachs was in talks to be an authorized participant (AP) for Grayscale and BlackRock ETFs, a role that involves creating and redeeming ETF shares to ensure the products trade closely aligned with their underlying assets.', 'Other Wall Street players have lined up to fill this role.', 'BlackRock’s AP roster includes quantitative high-speed trader Jane Street and JPMorgan, SEC filings show. Fellow ETF issuer Valkyrie has also teamed up with Jane Street and Cantor Fitzgerald to fulfill AP roles, another filing shows.', 'Meanwhile, that same month, the Nasdaq, CBOE, and NYSE Arca all filed 19b-4s for SEC approval to allow for the trading of related options, according to notices on their websites.\xa0On top of this, in February, CoinDesk reported that investment bank Morgan Stanley is allegedly looking into adding spot Bitcoin ETFs to its brokerage platform. The Wall Street behemoth is said to be carrying out due diligence on the products, according to sources close to the matter.

More companies are exploring IPOs, with Reddit being the new kid on the block following its March 21 debut. Reddit's IPO and others in the pipeline show that the risk appetite for IPO stocks is returning to the market. Here are two investment banks you can buy today to take advantage of the changing trends."", 'A little over two years ago, demand for newly public companies exploded, and Goldman Sachs (NYSE: GS) enjoyed record profits. According to the consulting firm PwC, 951 companies went public through IPOs, including traditional offerings and offerings through special purpose acquisition companies (SPACs), in 2021.', 'However, challenging market conditions made it less favorable for companies to go public. The Federal Reserve began aggressively raising its benchmark interest rate in 2022. The federal funds rate went from near zero to 5% in just over a year, resulting in volatility and the first S&P 500 bear market since the pandemic-induced sell-off. In 2023, companies remained cautious about going public; over the two years, there were only 175 IPOs.', ""Over that period, Goldman Sachs' investment banking revenue fell by 56%. This occurred simultaneously with the bank's move to consolidate its operations, including its struggling consumer banking business."", 'However, now may be an excellent time to scoop up the investment bank stock. According to Renaissance Capital, ""the IPO market\'s green shoots grew further"" in the first quarter, with 30 IPOs raising $7.8 billion. Although the count is similar to last year, the total dollar amount raised more than tripled, thanks to more significant offerings.', ""Today, Goldman Sachs is priced at 18 times earnings, above its 10-year average. However, investors must remember that the price-to-earnings ratio (P/E) is a backward-looking metric and could be skewed for cyclical businesses like investment banking. When considering this year's projected growth, Goldman Sachs trades at a cheap valuation of 12.3 times forward earnings, making it a solid stock to scoop up if you believe an investment banking revival is coming."", 'Morgan Stanley (NYSE: MS) also relies strongly on investment banking, and over two years, the company saw its revenue from these activities drop by 55%.', 'The company has navigated the challenging market well, thanks to the strength of its wealth and asset management businesses, which have helped smooth out its earnings volatility. However, the stock price is where it was two years ago, and it could be poised for a breakout if there is a strong pickup in investment banking this year.', 'Besides IPOs, mergers and acquisitions (M&A) are another significant source of income for investment bankers. Deal volumes dropped in recent years, although not as significantly as IPO volumes. According to PwC, M&A volumes were down by 25% last year as rising interest rates continued to pressure financing.', ""Signs are positive that M&A is coming back to life. Two major deals were announced last year, including ExxonMobil's $59.5 billion proposed acquisition of Pioneer and Chevron's $53 billion proposed acquisition of Hess. Deals this year include Hewlett Packard Enterprise's $14 billion proposed acquisition of Juniper Networks and BlackRock's $12.5 billion proposed acquisition of Global Infrastructure Partners."", ""According to Dealogic, the volume of M&A worldwide grew by 30% to $755 billion in the first quarter. Analysts project Morgan Stanley's earnings per share will grow 20% from last year. The stock is reasonably priced at 14.7 times this year's projected earnings, making it another solid investment bank stock to buy as conditions improve."", 'Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs have ridden out a tough couple of years for the firms. The stocks are back to (or slightly above) their pre-rate-hike prices after both fell 33% over the past couple of years.', 'The two companies will report earnings in mid-April, and investors will find out how they did in the first quarter.

The record on March 22 was attributed to the aftermath of the Fed’s recent policy decision. Financial markets anticipate interest rates will decline throughout the year, exerting typical upward pressure on gold prices. Several additional factors contribute to the expectation that gold prices will continue rising. Some of those are central bank purchases of gold, geopolitical uncertainties, and persistently high inflation.Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) analysts believe gold prices will increase over the next twelve months. Furthermore, Akin Investment suggests gold prices could rise to approximately $2,400 per ounce over the following two years. However, characteristics making gold a stable investment may also mean it offers less potential for capitalizing on gains than other options: gold provides stability during uncertain times but typically appreciates less than equities and does not generate income from dividends.Based on past trends, analysts believe gold mining companies can outperform physical gold prices, and there are several candidate stocks to buy. Historically, when gold miners’ stock prices lag behind rising gold prices, the miners subsequently outperform the commodity. With gold achieving record highs recently, the divergence in performance between gold and mining stocks is one of the widest in decades. Therefore, mining company share prices have substantial room to increase to align with gold prices that have recently moved up, potentially delivering outsized returns for investors seeking some stocks to buy as gold shines.Several gold companies offer compelling valuations as gold prices increase, with three stocks to buy presenting compelling reasons to outshine the precious metal.', 'Source: Misunseo / Shutterstock.com', 'One of the stocks to buy as gold prices are high is Sandstorm Gold (NYSE:SAND), a gold royalty and streaming company indirectly involved in mining operations. It generates revenue by acquiring royalties on mining assets operated by other companies.', 'Sandstorm has built a portfolio of over 250 royalty interests on mining projects worldwide. This business model allows the firm to benefit from rising gold prices without incurring the operational costs associated with mining. Under its royalty agreements, Sandstorm has the right to schedule gold production over the coming year totaling approximately 75,000 to 90,000 ounces. This entitlement is expected to grow to over 125,000 ounces annually over the next five years as more mining projects in its portfolio reach commercial production.SAND offers shareholders a competitive dividend yield of approximately 1.2% based on current payouts and share price. Analysts have an average 12-month target price of $7.36 for the stock, representing a potential upside of over 40% from current trading levels. The forecast growth, low-cost business model, and production growth profile make the company well-positioned to deliver attractive returns for investors.\u200b', 'InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips', 'Source: ©iStock.com/belchonock', 'Coeur Mining (NYSE:CDE) is the second of the three stocks to buy as gold prices rise. It presents an interesting opportunity for investors in gold mining companies actively engaged in production. Headquartered in the United States, Coeur owns and operates four precious metals mines globally – three located domestically and one in Mexico. Production is ramping up across all operations to maximize output.While CDE share prices have declined recently following an earnings miss, the company’s long-term potential remains intact. It issued additional stock to fund expansion efforts to grow its proven gold reserves, estimated at over 3.2 million ounces. Full-year 2024 guidance projects gold production in 310,000-355,000 ounces.Importantly, Coeur expects to reach design capacities at its mines this year. Once achieved, capital expenditures are forecasted to decrease. This could enable the business to generate net profits as precious gold prices hold steady.Most analyst firms following Coeur support it as one of the stocks to buy. Their price targets suggest meaningful upside potential exists, with shares possibly reaching $3.75 in the near term based on Coeur’s operational execution and balance sheet management. Overall, the company shows promise for investors seeking leverage to higher gold prices through established mining operations.\u200b', 'Source: Piotr Swat/Shutterstock', 'Newmont (NYSE:NEM) is the last one of the stocks to buy. It presents an intriguing opportunity for investors seeking stocks that may provide the stability often associated with gold prices. As one of the largest and most diversified active mining companies worldwide, Newmont offers investors significant geographic diversification.', 'The company has been actively growing its reserve base through strategic acquisitions such as the high-profile Newcrest Mining acquisition. This transaction enabled Newmont to increase its gold reserves by 41% to 135.9 million ounces. While developing its reserves required significant expenditure, causing the company to report a net loss last year, Newmont expects to benefit from this investment by the end of next year.Analysts covering Newmont appear especially optimistic about the company’s future prospects, evidenced by their average 12-month target price of $54.77. This represents a potential upside of approximately 55% from current levels. Newmont’s diversified portfolio of long-life assets and ongoing efforts to replenish its reserves through accretive Mergers and Acquisitions (M&A) provide a compelling case for the stock as a way for investors to access gold-related exposure through corporate equity.\u200b', 'On the date of publication, Stavros Tousios did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

Joining us now is Regina Mayor, KPMG Global Head of Clients and Markets.', ""Regina, it is good to see you. So oil has been rallying. We did reach this five-month high. What explains that, Regina? What's driving that move?"", ""REGINA MAYOR: Well, the market's been remarkably able to shrug off risk. And I guess in this particular instance, they haven't been able to. So we've got escalating tensions in the Middle East. There looks like there might be a spread. That's what's really driving the big kick up now. And we're starting to see demand actually continue to increase, like manufacturing-- manufacturing data from the US was stronger than it's ever been since 2022. China's was stronger for the last six months. So those are some of the factors that are going into it."", ""We also saw January, a lot of production was down because of some of the cold weather. So I think there was an expectation that stocks would be lower, demand is going higher, geopolitics are creating a greater risk factor. So those are the things that are driving the current rally. Personally, I don't expect that to continue."", ""JULIE HYMAN: Well, that's what I was going to ask you about, Regina, you know, whether some of those factors are going to remain in place. I mean, geopolitical tensions don't seem to be necessarily abating here. But what about the other factors that you were talking about?"", 'REGINA MAYOR: Well, stocks did build as you just mentioned. And so I do think January was a little bit of an anomaly when it came to production. And you see the US driving much greater levels of production, hitting record levels of production in December. And I would anticipate that will come back.', ""And the US is becoming a much greater exporter of its hydrocarbon resources. And that's driving a lot of positivity around easing supply concerns. I don't think demand is going to necessarily dampen. So if the geopolitical tensions do not scale back somewhat, especially in the Middle East, then you could potentially see a driver that increases prices. But frankly, I'm more on the bearish side, and I'm not going to predict the a three-digit oil price anytime soon."", ""JULIE HYMAN: OK. So that was going to be my next question for you, Regina. Where do you think the cap is in this current surge that we've seen?"", ""REGINA MAYOR: Again, I go back to the market has been incredibly remarkable in its ability to shrug off risk. This has been going on for the last two years since the conflict in Russia-- or the conflict in Ukraine when Russia invaded Ukraine took place. And even with a lot of those barrels coming off the market, we're still able to increase production from other parts of the world. And we've been able to meet the burgeoning demand."", 'We reached record high global demand in 2023, greater even than pre-pandemic. And I recall during the pandemic when we were saying we had reached peak demand, and that does not necessarily seem to be the case.', ""JOSH LIPTON: We keep talking about this phenomenon with regard to US stocks as well-- equities, that is. In other words, this sort of resilience, this view that because economic growth has continued, that stocks have just continued to go up. So I guess what I'm asking is, how much is animal spirits sort of a factor here? How much speculation is happening when it comes to the oil markets? And how tenacious can that be a factor going forward?"", ""REGINA MAYOR: It's incredibly speculative. I mean, there's all kinds of factors that drive supply and demand. And I believe that the market probably has been under-representing risk in the delicate supply-demand balance that we have for global crude supplies."", ""So you could say it's irrational exuberance, like we're seeing maybe in some of the equities markets. And if that potentially comes down, you know, what does that do? But if the stocks do eventually crash, that probably means a crash in oil prices as well. So I see enough dampeners as well as the things that are being priced in right now to say, I think this is something of a blip. But again, I'm not particularly good at predicting oil price. So don't take that one to the bank."", ""JULIE HYMAN: Well, I want to ask about gasoline also, because obviously that's getting a lot of attention-- I mean, it always gets a lot of attention. But it's in a presidential election year, there are some factors going on there. And in the past when we've seen these gasoline prices creep up, we have seen some pushback from motorists, who don't want to pay especially lofty prices. What kind of dynamics are we seeing at play this time?"", ""REGINA MAYOR: Well, the public's always able to vote with their feet when it comes to gasoline consumption-- not 100% So I'm not trying to be hyperbolic about it. I understand people need to drive their cars to get to and from work and to pick up their children and take them to school and things of that nature."", ""However, they might think twice about driving over the summer holiday if gas prices reach a level that they deem unacceptable. I've seen that typically at $5 per gallon in the Southern states where gas prices tend to be lower. You do see demand destruction."", ""We're getting into summer driving season. We expect gasoline demand to continue to grow. That will drive prices up in the short term. So the extent to which it's affecting an American's pocketbook will drive how they behave this summer."", 'JULIE HYMAN: Regina, good to see you. Thanks for joining us.', 'Thanks']"

Fed Chair Jerome Powell made a speech on Wednesday reiterating the point that it relies on inflation data, that inflation is on a ""bumpy"" path to the target goal, and that an interest rate cut is likely to happen within the year.', 'Commodities have been on the rise as inflation remains and supply issues have boosted prices for commodities like golld (CC=F), while the energy sector continues to perform poorly in the long term, but may have room to grow', 'Yahoo Finance Reporter Josh Schafer joins Market Domination Overtime to break down the top takeaways from the trading day for April 3.', 'For more expert insight and the latest market action, click here to watch this full episode of Market Domination Overtime.', ""Editor's note: This article was written by Nicholas Jacobino"", ""JOSH LIPTON: Joshua Schafer is here with a look at some of the key themes from today's action. Joshua."", 'JOSH SCHAFER: Yeah, Josh. I think inflation was the big story today again, with specifically of course, we had Jay Powell talking extensively about inflation for a long period of time today, but also we had more data out on inflation. And since apparently the prices paid index from ISM is the new thing we all love to follow and that was our big market narrative this week, when you think about what we saw earlier from the prices paid index in terms of manufacturing data-- that was hot, right? And we were all worried about inflation and goods inflation potentially spiking there.', ""But this morning, we got the services index and the prices paid there. Prices paid hit its lowest level since March, 2020, in the services index. And last time I checked, the thing we talk about more with inflation is services. So economists largely reacted positively to this news saying that this is good sign. It's a good sign for super core inflation, which you hear the Fed talk about a lot and that being on track to coming back down to 2%."", ""And I guess maybe my prevailing takeaway putting those two together would just be bumpy. We're not going to get clean-- seriously though. Like we're not going to get clean data, right? If we're going to sit here and put a microscope on every little print, it's not going to keep telling you a consistent story. And so maybe just zoom out and maybe listening to what Jerome Powell is saying about, we think it's coming down eventually, it's going to be bumpy, is rather intuitive right now."", ""JOSH LIPTON: And so he says it's going to be-- he sticks to his narrative. It's going to be bumpy, but on our way back down to my 2% target, despite though, Josh, even what we're seeing in the commodities complex."", ""JOSH SCHAFER: Yeah, I mean, commodities are spiking, right? Commodities are ripping when you look at, basically, across the board, right? Jared just hit on oil. Look at Gold. I think it hit another all time high at some point today. Silver spiking, copper spiking. And what's been interesting to me, has that's been the trade we've seen in equities too, right? Energy, , again leading today. It wasn't the leading sector, but it was one of the leading sectors extending it's lead for the year."", ""Even when you look inside industry like industrials, which was also up today. Some of the stocks that have been up there really do sort of relate to commodities in that sense. So it's been interesting to see investors chase that trade a little bit, go into some of those commodity specific sectors. And one thing I wanted to highlight guys, in energy specifically, was Datatrek did an interesting little analysis on this the other day. They posted this yesterday morning."", ""Datatrek research, great team over there. And what they highlighted was the energy is still kind of chasing the S&P 500. When you take a look at its performance over the last 100 days, the trailing returns. So you can see the S&P 500 there is below the zero level, meaning it's still lagging. Like we're talking a lot about energy outperforming this year. And yes, it is. If you look at a six month of the sectors, it's the worst performing sectors though."", 'JULIE HYMAN: Right.', 'JOSH SCHAFER: And so Datatrek essentially making the point that if this bid in energy is real, which they think it is, it probably has more room to run because a lot of people, when you talk to different oil analysts right now, the argument for oil prices would be if anything they might go up, and that would also be good for the energy sector.', ""- But Jay Powell says, well, that's not necessarily going to feed through into inflation. That's going to be the main-- the key to see whether it does feed through."", 'JOSH SCHAFER: And with that, just if it does feed through, it would be interesting to see how consumers sort of react to that, right? Because we know the Fed likes to dismiss it, but at some point, you would think it probably impacts things like gas prices and maybe then it hurts, I guess, how people are feeling about inflation. We like to talk about that.', 'JULIE HYMAN: Maybe.', ""JOSH SCHAFER: Or, maybe it doesn't, Julie.

Through strategic measures such as consolidating businesses, implementing efficient systems, closing plants and branches, optimizing the global supply chain, and reducing headcount, Masco has achieved substantial annual savings while simplifying its organizational structure.To combat challenges like raw material inflation and tariffs, Masco has taken proactive steps, including implementing pricing adjustments and collaborating with suppliers and internal teams to identify cost-saving opportunities. Moreover, the company has initiated the relocation of some production out of China for long-term sustainability.The tangible results of these efforts are evident in Masco's financial performance. In 2023, the company's adjusted operating margin surged 120 basis points year over year to 16.8%. This improvement was primarily driven by a favorable price/cost dynamic and the successful implementation of cost-saving initiatives despite facing lower volumes.

The company foresees robust growth, expecting to achieve an average annual organic sales growth of 3-5%. Additionally, acquisitions are projected to contribute 1-3% annually to sales.Masco is confident in its ability to deliver strong earnings growth, targeting an average annual EPS growth of around 10%. This growth will be supported by the expansion of operating margins through cost productivity improvements and leveraging volume. Furthermore, Masco aims to reach its long-term full-year margin targets, aiming for nearly 18.5% by 2026. Within this target, the Plumbing Products segment is expected to grow by approximately 20%, while the Decorative Architectural Products segment is anticipated to rise 19-20%.In addition to growth-oriented strategies, Masco is committed to delivering value to its shareholders. The company plans to return 1-2% above EPS growth to shareholders through dividends and 2-4% through share repurchases.

Joining us now is Regina Mayor, KPMG Global Head of Clients and Markets.', ""Regina, it is good to see you. So oil has been rallying. We did reach this five-month high. What explains that, Regina? What's driving that move?"", ""REGINA MAYOR: Well, the market's been remarkably able to shrug off risk. And I guess in this particular instance, they haven't been able to. So we've got escalating tensions in the Middle East. There looks like there might be a spread. That's what's really driving the big kick up now. And we're starting to see demand actually continue to increase, like manufacturing-- manufacturing data from the US was stronger than it's ever been since 2022. China's was stronger for the last six months. So those are some of the factors that are going into it."", ""We also saw January, a lot of production was down because of some of the cold weather. So I think there was an expectation that stocks would be lower, demand is going higher, geopolitics are creating a greater risk factor. So those are the things that are driving the current rally. Personally, I don't expect that to continue."", ""JULIE HYMAN: Well, that's what I was going to ask you about, Regina, you know, whether some of those factors are going to remain in place. I mean, geopolitical tensions don't seem to be necessarily abating here. But what about the other factors that you were talking about?"", 'REGINA MAYOR: Well, stocks did build as you just mentioned. And so I do think January was a little bit of an anomaly when it came to production. And you see the US driving much greater levels of production, hitting record levels of production in December. And I would anticipate that will come back.', ""And the US is becoming a much greater exporter of its hydrocarbon resources. And that's driving a lot of positivity around easing supply concerns. I don't think demand is going to necessarily dampen. So if the geopolitical tensions do not scale back somewhat, especially in the Middle East, then you could potentially see a driver that increases prices. But frankly, I'm more on the bearish side, and I'm not going to predict the a three-digit oil price anytime soon."", ""JULIE HYMAN: OK. So that was going to be my next question for you, Regina. Where do you think the cap is in this current surge that we've seen?"", ""REGINA MAYOR: Again, I go back to the market has been incredibly remarkable in its ability to shrug off risk. This has been going on for the last two years since the conflict in Russia-- or the conflict in Ukraine when Russia invaded Ukraine took place. And even with a lot of those barrels coming off the market, we're still able to increase production from other parts of the world. And we've been able to meet the burgeoning demand."", 'We reached record high global demand in 2023, greater even than pre-pandemic. And I recall during the pandemic when we were saying we had reached peak demand, and that does not necessarily seem to be the case.', ""JOSH LIPTON: We keep talking about this phenomenon with regard to US stocks as well-- equities, that is. In other words, this sort of resilience, this view that because economic growth has continued, that stocks have just continued to go up. So I guess what I'm asking is, how much is animal spirits sort of a factor here? How much speculation is happening when it comes to the oil markets? And how tenacious can that be a factor going forward?"", ""REGINA MAYOR: It's incredibly speculative. I mean, there's all kinds of factors that drive supply and demand. And I believe that the market probably has been under-representing risk in the delicate supply-demand balance that we have for global crude supplies."", ""So you could say it's irrational exuberance, like we're seeing maybe in some of the equities markets. And if that potentially comes down, you know, what does that do? But if the stocks do eventually crash, that probably means a crash in oil prices as well. So I see enough dampeners as well as the things that are being priced in right now to say, I think this is something of a blip. But again, I'm not particularly good at predicting oil price. So don't take that one to the bank."", ""JULIE HYMAN: Well, I want to ask about gasoline also, because obviously that's getting a lot of attention-- I mean, it always gets a lot of attention. But it's in a presidential election year, there are some factors going on there. And in the past when we've seen these gasoline prices creep up, we have seen some pushback from motorists, who don't want to pay especially lofty prices. What kind of dynamics are we seeing at play this time?"", ""REGINA MAYOR: Well, the public's always able to vote with their feet when it comes to gasoline consumption-- not 100% So I'm not trying to be hyperbolic about it. I understand people need to drive their cars to get to and from work and to pick up their children and take them to school and things of that nature."", ""However, they might think twice about driving over the summer holiday if gas prices reach a level that they deem unacceptable. I've seen that typically at $5 per gallon in the Southern states where gas prices tend to be lower. You do see demand destruction."", ""We're getting into summer driving season. We expect gasoline demand to continue to grow. That will drive prices up in the short term.

Fed Chair Jerome Powell made a speech on Wednesday reiterating the point that it relies on inflation data, that inflation is on a ""bumpy"" path to the target goal, and that an interest rate cut is likely to happen within the year.', 'Commodities have been on the rise as inflation remains and supply issues have boosted prices for commodities like golld (CC=F), while the energy sector continues to perform poorly in the long term, but may have room to grow', 'Yahoo Finance Reporter Josh Schafer joins Market Domination Overtime to break down the top takeaways from the trading day for April 3.', 'For more expert insight and the latest market action, click here to watch this full episode of Market Domination Overtime.', ""Editor's note: This article was written by Nicholas Jacobino"", ""JOSH LIPTON: Joshua Schafer is here with a look at some of the key themes from today's action. Joshua."", 'JOSH SCHAFER: Yeah, Josh. I think inflation was the big story today again, with specifically of course, we had Jay Powell talking extensively about inflation for a long period of time today, but also we had more data out on inflation. And since apparently the prices paid index from ISM is the new thing we all love to follow and that was our big market narrative this week, when you think about what we saw earlier from the prices paid index in terms of manufacturing data-- that was hot, right? And we were all worried about inflation and goods inflation potentially spiking there.', ""But this morning, we got the services index and the prices paid there. Prices paid hit its lowest level since March, 2020, in the services index. And last time I checked, the thing we talk about more with inflation is services. So economists largely reacted positively to this news saying that this is good sign. It's a good sign for super core inflation, which you hear the Fed talk about a lot and that being on track to coming back down to 2%."", ""And I guess maybe my prevailing takeaway putting those two together would just be bumpy. We're not going to get clean-- seriously though. Like we're not going to get clean data, right? If we're going to sit here and put a microscope on every little print, it's not going to keep telling you a consistent story. And so maybe just zoom out and maybe listening to what Jerome Powell is saying about, we think it's coming down eventually, it's going to be bumpy, is rather intuitive right now."", ""JOSH LIPTON: And so he says it's going to be-- he sticks to his narrative. It's going to be bumpy, but on our way back down to my 2% target, despite though, Josh, even what we're seeing in the commodities complex."", ""JOSH SCHAFER: Yeah, I mean, commodities are spiking, right? Commodities are ripping when you look at, basically, across the board, right? Jared just hit on oil. Look at Gold. I think it hit another all time high at some point today. Silver spiking, copper spiking. And what's been interesting to me, has that's been the trade we've seen in equities too, right? Energy, , again leading today. It wasn't the leading sector, but it was one of the leading sectors extending it's lead for the year."", ""Even when you look inside industry like industrials, which was also up today. Some of the stocks that have been up there really do sort of relate to commodities in that sense. So it's been interesting to see investors chase that trade a little bit, go into some of those commodity specific sectors. And one thing I wanted to highlight guys, in energy specifically, was Datatrek did an interesting little analysis on this the other day. They posted this yesterday morning."", ""Datatrek research, great team over there. And what they highlighted was the energy is still kind of chasing the S&P 500. When you take a look at its performance over the last 100 days, the trailing returns. So you can see the S&P 500 there is below the zero level, meaning it's still lagging. Like we're talking a lot about energy outperforming this year. And yes, it is. If you look at a six month of the sectors, it's the worst performing sectors though."", 'JULIE HYMAN: Right.', 'JOSH SCHAFER: And so Datatrek essentially making the point that if this bid in energy is real, which they think it is, it probably has more room to run because a lot of people, when you talk to different oil analysts right now, the argument for oil prices would be if anything they might go up, and that would also be good for the energy sector.', ""- But Jay Powell says, well, that's not necessarily going to feed through into inflation. That's going to be the main-- the key to see whether it does feed through."", 'JOSH SCHAFER: And with that, just if it does feed through, it would be interesting to see how consumers sort of react to that, right? Because we know the Fed likes to dismiss it, but at some point, you would think it probably impacts things like gas prices and maybe then it hurts, I guess, how people are feeling about inflation. We like to talk about that.', 'JULIE HYMAN: Maybe.', ""JOSH SCHAFER: Or, maybe it doesn't, Julie.

It's only natural to consider a company's balance sheet when you examine how risky it is, since debt is often involved when a business collapses. As with many other companies Lockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE:LMT) makes use of debt. But is this debt a concern to shareholders?"", ""Generally speaking, debt only becomes a real problem when a company can't easily pay it off, either by raising capital or with its own cash flow. If things get really bad, the lenders can take control of the business. However, a more common (but still painful) scenario is that it has to raise new equity capital at a low price, thus permanently diluting shareholders. Having said that, the most common situation is where a company manages its debt reasonably well - and to its own advantage. The first thing to do when considering how much debt a business uses is to look at its cash and debt together."", ' View our latest analysis for Lockheed Martin ', 'The image below, which you can click on for greater detail, shows that at December 2023 Lockheed Martin had debt of US$17.5b, up from US$15.5b in one year. However, it also had US$1.44b in cash, and so its net debt is US$16.0b.', 'According to the last reported balance sheet, Lockheed Martin had liabilities of US$16.9b due within 12 months, and liabilities of US$28.7b due beyond 12 months. On the other hand, it had cash of US$1.44b and US$15.3b worth of receivables due within a year. So it has liabilities totalling US$28.9b more than its cash and near-term receivables, combined.', 'While this might seem like a lot, it is not so bad since Lockheed Martin has a huge market capitalization of US$107.7b, and so it could probably strengthen its balance sheet by raising capital if it needed to. However, it is still worthwhile taking a close look at its ability to pay off debt.', ""We measure a company's debt load relative to its earnings power by looking at its net debt divided by its earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) and by calculating how easily its earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) cover its interest expense (interest cover). Thus we consider debt relative to earnings both with and without depreciation and amortization expenses."", ""Lockheed Martin's net debt of 1.6 times EBITDA suggests graceful use of debt. And the alluring interest cover (EBIT of 9.9 times interest expense) certainly does not do anything to dispel this impression. Another good sign is that Lockheed Martin has been able to increase its EBIT by 21% in twelve months, making it easier to pay down debt. When analysing debt levels, the balance sheet is the obvious place to start. But it is future earnings, more than anything, that will determine Lockheed Martin's ability to maintain a healthy balance sheet going forward. So if you want to see what the professionals think, you might find this free report on analyst profit forecasts to be interesting."", ""Finally, a business needs free cash flow to pay off debt; accounting profits just don't cut it. So we clearly need to look at whether that EBIT is leading to corresponding free cash flow. Over the last three years, Lockheed Martin recorded free cash flow worth a fulsome 82% of its EBIT, which is stronger than we'd usually expect. That positions it well to pay down debt if desirable to do so."", ""The good news is that Lockheed Martin's demonstrated ability to convert EBIT to free cash flow delights us like a fluffy puppy does a toddler. And that's just the beginning of the good news since its EBIT growth rate is also very heartening. Looking at the bigger picture, we think Lockheed Martin's use of debt seems quite reasonable and we're not concerned about it. While debt does bring risk, when used wisely it can also bring a higher return on equity. There's no doubt that we learn most about debt from the balance sheet. But ultimately, every company can contain risks that exist outside of the balance sheet. For instance, we've identified   2 warning signs for Lockheed Martin  that you should be aware of."", ""When all is said and done, sometimes its easier to focus on companies that don't even need debt.

In the \'long\' context, investors will be essentially be ""buying high, but hoping to sell even higher."" With this methodology, taking advantage of trends in a stock\'s price is key; once a stock establishes a course, it is more than likely to continue moving that way. The goal is that once a stock heads down a fixed path, it will lead to timely and profitable trades.', 'Even though momentum is a popular stock characteristic, it can be tough to define. Debate surrounding which are the best and worst metrics to focus on is lengthy, but the Zacks Momentum Style Score, part of the Zacks Style Scores, helps address this issue for us.', 'Below, we take a look at PulteGroup (PHM), which currently has a Momentum Style Score of A.

Shares are looking quite well from a longer time frame too, as the monthly price change of 3.4% compares favorably with the industry's 2.41% performance as well."", 'While any stock can see its price increase, it takes a real winner to consistently beat the market. That is why looking at longer term price metrics -- such as performance over the past three months or year -- can be useful as well.

In comparison, the S&P 500 has only moved 10.16% and 28.53%, respectively.', ""Investors should also pay attention to PHM's average 20-day trading volume. Volume is a useful item in many ways, and the 20-day average establishes a good price-to-volume baseline; a rising stock with above average volume is generally a bullish sign, whereas a declining stock on above average volume is typically bearish. PHM is currently averaging 1,712,974 shares for the last 20 days."", 'Earnings Outlook', 'The Zacks Momentum Style Score also takes into account trends in estimate revisions, in addition to price changes.

He also wanted to “innovate for impact,” meaning he didn't just want to invest in the latest buzzy technology, but instead focus on technologies that would ultimately support better health outcomes."", ""For his third goal, he found inspiration in his own education. At Drexel University, Swanson earned a bachelor’s degree in bioscience and biotechnology, as well as a master’s degree in computer science. He's drawn to the combination of science and technology, and that's led him to encourage J&J's 130,000 workforce to add tech skills that are relevant to their area of focus."", ""“If you apply technology, coupled with people’s domain expertise, you can really reimagine and innovate versus just incrementally improve,” says Swanson, who was previously CIO at Monsanto, Bayer Crop Science, and for J&J's pharmaceuticals arm. “We've seen a lot of value in thinking about bilingual skills, even to the point that we build it into career paths and career journeys.”"", 'To be bilingual, as Swanson defines it for the purposes of our conversation, is to have domain expertise as a scientist, or in departments from finance to marketing, and combine that knowledge with relevant tech insights. For such upskilling, employees can take interactive classes or watch videos that have been developed by J&J and external vendors.', ""Swanson shared a few examples of how bilingual employees are imperative to J&J's success and the company's mission. One is a research and development scientist who takes time to learn how to apply models that make it easier to identify molecules and can then accelerate research within a clinical setting. Another is a training specialist who adds augmented reality expertise and can therefore teach surgeons far faster than using traditional methods. Yet another is a finance employee who's adept at using forecasting models and can leverage them to drive meaningful insights that can support J&J’s business goals."", 'With forecasting, a mere one to two percentage point improvement in accuracy can create as much as $1.5 billion of financial improvement to a $90 billion company like J&J, Swanson says. ""That is material for the company,"" he argues.', ""And while upskilling J&J’s workforce to better understand artificial intelligence is a priority, Swanson says adding tech skills is a lot broader than AI. Augmented reality and new technologies that help reimagine J&J's manufacturing processes are important too."", 'As part of its tech education push last year, J&J hosted its first global ""day of learning"" for all employees. It\'s also had success more broadly, getting nearly half of its workforce to use the company’s internal learning platform, J&J Learn. Meanwhile, employees using J&J\'s digital boot camp—courses that explain the fundamentals of AI, automation, data, and more—have completed nearly 30,000 courses. And around 20,000 workers have taken a generative AI training course, which is required for those who want to leverage that technology.', 'To foster a culture of learning, Swanson partners closely with senior leaders across J&J, as well as human resources chief Peter Fasolo, to align on the training content and tech skills the company wants for its workforce. Swanson first tested his vision to connect tech know-how with domain expertise within his own department of around 4,000 employees, before expanding his learnings to other corners of J&J.', '“We\'re on a journey for sure and we\'re not done,"" says Swanson. ""We have a lot more to do. And I wouldn\'t say we have perfection, but it really has taken momentum.”', 'John Kell', 'Send thoughts or suggestions to\xa0CIO Intelligence here.', 'This story was originally featured on Fortune.com']"

Mutations in KRAS are among the most prevalent mutations found in cancer, occurring with high frequency in non-small cell lung cancer, pancreatic, urogenital and colorectal cancers. The KRAS G12C mutation is the most frequently observed KRAS mutation in patients, occurring in approximately 14% of non-small cell lung cancers (adenocarcinoma). Despite decades of research and recognition of the therapeutic importance of targeting KRAS, the development of small molecule inhibitors targeting KRAS mutations has been challenging.', 'About lung cancer', 'Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer death worldwide. In 2022 alone, there were approximately 2.4 million new cases and 1.8 million deaths from lung cancer globally. Non-small cell lung cancer is the most common type of lung cancer, accounting for about 80% of all cases. In 2024, the overall five-year survival rate for patients diagnosed with lung cancer is 25% in the United States. Improved survival rates are due, in part, to earlier detection and screening, reduction in smoking, advances in diagnostic and surgical procedures, as well as the introduction of new therapies. Early detection and screening remain an important unmet need, as 44% of lung cancer cases are not found until they are advanced.', 'About Merck’s research in lung cancer', 'Merck is advancing research aimed at transforming the way lung cancer is treated, with a goal of improving outcomes for patients affected by this deadly disease. Through nearly 200 clinical trials evaluating more than 36,000 patients around the world, Merck is at the forefront of lung cancer research. In NSCLC, KEYTRUDA has six approved U.S. indications (see indications below) and is approved for advanced disease in more than 95 countries. Among Merck’s research efforts are trials focused on evaluating KEYTRUDA in earlier stages of lung cancer as well as identifying new combinations and coformulations with KEYTRUDA.', 'About KEYTRUDA® (pembrolizumab) injection, 100 mg', 'KEYTRUDA is an anti-programmed death receptor-1 (PD-1) therapy that works by increasing the ability of the body’s immune system to help detect and fight tumor cells.

The natural gas pipeline giant currently offers a 6.1% dividend yield, one of the highest in the S&P 500. That big-time payout is on rock-solid ground, making it an excellent option for those seeking to collect steady dividend income."", ""However, if there's a knock against Kinder Morgan, the pipeline giant has struggled to grow over the years. That's why investors who like Kinder Morgan should check out fellow natural gas pipeline stock Williams (NYSE: WMB). While Williams currently has a lower dividend yield (4.8%), it could continue growing faster than Kinder Morgan in the future."", ""Kinder Morgan has been in a bit of a rut for much of the past several years. Last year, it generated $7.5 billion of adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA). That was flat with both 2022's and 2018's levels. "", ""Two headwinds have weighed on Kinder Morgan's growth in recent years. First, it has sold billions of dollars in assets to repay debt. Those sales have helped drive its leverage ratio down by 26% since 2016 to a much more comfortable 3.9 times (well below its long-term target of 4.5 times). Second, it has had to address large contract rollovers on several pipeline systems. "", 'On a more positive note, those headwinds will fade this year. That will enable the company to benefit from several growth drivers, including recently completed expansion projects and its recent $1.8 billion acquisition of STX Midstream. Those catalysts should boost its adjusted EBITDA by about 8% in 2024. ', 'Meanwhile, the company has about $3 billion of high-return expansion projects in the backlog to drive future growth. It also has a much stronger balance sheet, giving it lots of flexibility to make acquisitions to accelerate growth. ', 'However, despite that growth, the company will likely only provide modest dividend increases in the future. It expects to raise its payout by about 2% this year, roughly in line with its recent pace. While investors can expect to collect a high-yielding and modestly rising dividend, that might not be exciting enough for some to own the stock.', ""Williams hasn't faced the same headwinds as Kinder Morgan in recent years. Because of that, the company has grown its adjusted EBITDA at an 8% compound annual rate since 2018 to its current level of $6.8 billion. The natural gas pipeline company has delivered that growth while also cutting leverage by 25% since 2018 to its current level of 3.6 times. "", 'The company expects to continue expanding at a solid rate. Its long-term target is to grow its adjusted EBITDA at a 5% to 7% annual rate. It has a large backlog of expansion projects to fuel its growth, with projects lined up to come online through 2027.', "" It expects to invest $3.4 billion into growth capital projects over the next two years alone. On top of those secured projects, it's pursuing 30 additional natural gas transmission projects that could fuel its growth well into the next decade. "", 'Meanwhile, its low leverage ratio gives it lots of financial flexibility to make acquisitions to support its growth target. It recently bought a major natural gas storage portfolio for roughly $2 billion. That followed two notable deal closings in 2023 (its $1.5 billion acquisition of MountainWest and $1.3 billion of strategic transactions to strengthen its position in the DJ Basin).', ' It has made $6.1 billion in acquisitions since 2021. Given its low leverage ratio, Williams has the flexibility to make additional acquisitions as opportunities arise. ', ""Williams' faster earnings growth has enabled it to deliver a higher dividend growth rate. It has grown its payout at a 6% compound annual rate since 2018, including by 6.1% earlier this year. Given its low dividend payout ratio (2.3 times coverage in 2024, compared to about 2 times for Kinder Morgan) and faster-projected earnings growth rate, it could continue to deliver mid-single-digit dividend growth. "", ""Kinder Morgan is a great stock for those seeking a high-yielding and reliable income stream that should rise at a modest pace over the long term. While Williams doesn't offer as high a yield as Kinder Morgan, it's growing its earnings and dividend faster. Because of that, it could produce higher total returns over the long term. That makes it a potentially more compelling option, compared to its more popular peer.

The basic way of investing in the real estate market is to buy a house. An easier way is to invest through a real estate investment trust (REIT). In this blog post, we look at three REIT stocks that offer you solid exposure to the real estate market in the United States.', 'Generally speaking, the potential return on real estate investments is influenced by a variety of factors, with market conditions playing a pivotal role. Supply and demand significantly affect market dynamics; limited supply and high demand lead to price increases, enhancing seller returns.', 'Interest rates, closely tied to Federal Reserve policies, also have a substantial effect. Higher interest rates can depress the real estate market, lowering demand and selling prices, thus reducing profit margins.', 'InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips', 'An investment strategy is key, with different approaches yielding varying returns. In the U.S., the median annual return on real estate stands at 8.6%. Residential properties typically yield a 10.6% return, commercial properties 9.5% and REITs 11.8%.', 'As a REIT investor, you would want to consider metrics such as the capitalization rate, internal rate of return (IRR) and cash-on-cash return. These measures provide a more comprehensive view of an investment’s performance, beyond simply looking at Return on Investment (ROI).', 'Let’s take a look at these three REIT stocks showing great results.', 'Source: Ken Wolter / Shutterstock.com', 'Public Storage (NYSE:PSA) is a major self-storage company, best known for offering secure and accessible storage solutions.

As a REIT, it also offers investors a way to gain exposure to the lucrative self-storage market.', 'Most recently, Public Storage reported record revenues and net operating income for the fourth quarter of 2023. More precisely, the company reported a net income of $2.21 per diluted share, along with a Core FFO (funds from operations) of $4.20 per diluted share.', 'During the quarter, Public Storage acquired 11 self-storage facilities, adding 0.8 million net rentable square feet for $171.9 million. Moreover, the company opened five newly developed facilities and undertook various expansion projects, further adding 0.8 million net rentable square feet at a cost of $190.3 million.', 'Public Storage stock is down 6% year-to-date (YTD) as investors continue to aggressively invest in AI-linked companies and sectors.', 'Source: rafapress / Shutterstock.com', 'Prologis (NYSE:PLD) is a global leader in logistics real estate, specializing in the ownership, operation and development of high-quality warehouses and distribution centers. With properties strategically located across the Americas, Europe and Asia, Prologis is one of the largest REIT stocks by market capitalization.', 'Back in January, Prologis reported fourth-quarter results and full-year guidance that came in light with analyst expectations. Prologis announced a core FFO of $1.26, a slight increase from the previous year, with rental revenue rising by 10% to $1.76 billion. That growth contributed to a total consolidated revenue of $1.89 billion, marking a 7.8% year-over-year (YoY) increase.', 'Last year marked the fourth consecutive year of double-digit earnings growth for Prologis, making it a solid candidate for one of the best REIT stocks out there. The projected full-year core FFO ranges between $5.42 and $5.56, closely encompassing the consensus estimate of $5.52. Adjusted projections, excluding net promote, suggest a near 9% YoY increase at the midpoint.', 'The fourth quarter saw stable occupancy rates at 97.1%, with a slight YoY decrease.

What can I do?', 'Fidelity to charge $100 servicing fee on some ETFs', 'Bought a house during the pandemic? Here’s how much more that same home would cost today.', 'During an interview with MarketWatch, Taylor discussed the fund’s top holdings and also pointed to a stock the fund holds that is outside the healthcare sector and that he thinks has the potential to provide exponential returns.', 'The Simplify Health Care ETF PINK was launched on Oct. 7, 2021, and the shares began trading the next day. The fund’s annual expenses total 0.50% of assets under management and it donates all of its net profits to Susan G. Komen for the Cure, a nonprofit organization that works to support people with breast cancer and to fund research on prevention and treatment of the disease.', 'While the fund’s management fees are donated, Taylor said he would profit along with the fund because he is one of its top three shareholders.', 'PINK has been a good performer since it was established, as you can see below.', 'Early in his career, Taylor earned a master’s degree in biotechnology at Johns Hopkins University and worked on gene-therapy research projects at GenVac before earning a master’s in business from the University of Rochester and moving into a money-management career, starting at Oppenheimer. He has managed several healthcare-fund portfolios and health-oriented hedge funds over the course of his career.', 'He described his approach for the Simplify Health Care ETF as “idiosyncratic” — not only for its stock selection but for his ability to move more nimbly than competitors running very large funds in order to right-size investment positions.', 'Before getting to Taylor’s comments on specific companies, here are the fund’s 10 largest holdings:', 'Company', 'Ticker', '% of Simplify Health Care ETF as of March 28', 'Intuitive Surgical Inc.', 'ISRG', '9.5%', 'Sarepta Therapeutics Inc.', 'SRPT', '8.6%', 'Cigna Group', 'CI', '6.5%', 'PureCycle Technologies Inc.', 'PCT', '4.9%', 'Cooper Cos.', 'COO', '4.7%', 'Align Technology Inc.', 'ALGN', '4.6%', 'Merck & Co.', 'MRK', '4.6%', 'Eli Lilly & Co.', 'LLY', '4.6%', 'Shockwave Medical Inc.', 'SWAV', '3.6%', 'Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc.', 'TMO', '3.5%', 'Source: Simplify ETFs', 'PINK’s largest holding is Intuitive Surgical Inc. ISRG. Taylor believes revenue and profit estimates for this company among analysts working for brokerage firms are too low, because the company plans to bring new robotic-surgery equipment to the market this year. Intuitive trades at valuations of 60.4 times the consensus earnings-per-share estimate for the next 12 months among analysts polled by FactSet, and at a forward price-to-sales ratio of 16.8. These are very high when compared with a forward P/E of 21.1 for the S&P 500 SPX and a forward price/sales ratio of 2.7 for the index.', 'Then again, Intuitive’s five-year average forward P/E has been 50.8, according to FactSet. Looking ahead at calendar-year estimates, the company is expected to increase its sales at a compound annual growth rate of 13.9% from 2023 through 2025, with an expected EPS CAGR of 12.9%, based on consensus estimates. Those are compared with an expected sales CAGR of 5.3% and EPS CAGR of 12.3% for the S&P 500.', 'The fund’s second-largest holding is Sarepta Therapeutics Inc. SRPT, which is awaiting Food and Drug Administration approval for its new therapy for Duchenne muscular dystrophy. Taylor believes the stock could double because of the high price tag for the treatment, assuming it is approved. “Sarepta has an opportunity to get a label from the FDA to treat all of DMD, which would turn it into a $5 billion drug for most of the next several years,” he said. The company’s market capitalization is $11.6 billion.', 'If Sarepta fails to gain FDA approval for its DMD treatment, Taylor expects the stock to drop 30%. But he is confident that his thesis will play out. “And since I treat it as if it is my money, we have a large position,” he said. “Nothing that can destroy us, but enough so we can make serious returns.”', 'The third-largest holding in the PINK portfolio is Cigna Group CI, which is one of six companies in the S&P 500 categorized by FactSet as managed-care providers (or health-maintenance organizations). What sets Cigna apart, according to Taylor, is that nearly all of its business comes from commercial clients — employer-sponsored health-insurance plans — while the other five players are focused on Medicare Advantage plans. Cigna’s shares have returned 44% over the past year.', 'Cigna’s stock trades at a low forward P/E of 12.4. It is “cheap because the space is overlooked by investors. There is always this looming threat of national healthcare,” Taylor said. He added that competing managers of healthcare funds “got it wrong” in their analysis of the HMO space, because “they didn’t figure out which one would outperform and size for it.”', 'PINK holds shares of Eli Lilly & Co. LLY, which have soared with the success of the company’s GLP-1 medications to treat diabetes and to help people lose weight. But Taylor is steering clear of Lilly’s largest competitor, Novo Nordisk A/S NVO, because the latter’s “prescription trends for dispensing their GLP-1s are not in line with expectations” in the U.S. market. He also said: “I do believe that Lilly has the superior molecule — better safety and better efficacy.”', 'He sees a long growth runway for GLP-1 medications because they are now covered by Medicare for treatment of diabetes, but are not yet covered for patients who need to lose weight. With so many people at risk for expensive medical problems that can result from obesity, there is potential for a large expansion of this drug category, as Medicare and insurers realize the benefit of covering GLP-1s for more purposes, Taylor said.', 'In healthcare, especially biotechnology, binary events can make investors a lot of money. A company’s share price may soar as it nears expected FDA approval for a new medicine, treatment or device, and it may crash if it fails to gain approval.', 'The Simplify Health Care ETF can have up to 20% of its portfolio invested outside the healthcare sector, and Taylor cited PureCycle Technologies Inc. PCT as an example of such a stock. And it sure is a binary play. The company has a market capitalization of less than $1 billion. It has licensed technology from Procter & Gamble Co. PG that enables recycling of polypropylene.', 'Polypropylene is a commonly used plastic that people often put into recycling bins.

Thus, more than 90 percent of the Nike ‘Sustainability’ Collection products are not ‘made with recycled fibers.’”', 'The complaint also took aim at Nike for using recycled polyester and nylon, both of which are plastic-based synthetics. The plaintiff alleged that neither of those materials are sustainable and cause palpable harm to the environment because of the shedding of microplastics and the limited lives of recycled fibers.', 'Ultimately, though, Ellis’ arguments failed to persuade Judge Matthew Schelp that the case should see trial.', 'In the memorandum and order to dismiss the case, Schlep wrote the following in reference to Ellis’ claims around recycled fibers: “How does she know this to be true? She does not say…She makes no mention of any testing or analysis. She says nothing about how their look or feel might indicate their makeup. She puts forth no allegations surrounding the supplier of defendants’ materials. She claims nothing about the manufacturing process. She details no inside knowledge from, say, a whistleblower, for example, who has come forward on this alleged massive corporate lie.”', 'He went on to conclude that an exhibit the plaintiff submitted to the court detailing the material makeups of certain products “is silent on whether the products contain or do not contain recycled material or organic material. That is, it does not say that the polyester [or materials] in these products was or was not virgin or was or was not recycled.”', 'Schelp concludes that the allegations are conclusory and that Ellis also failed to adequately describe the nature of the advertisements, labels and marketing from Nike that allegedly convinced her to purchase the products.', 'Nike isn’t the only company that has recently skirted legal trouble over greenwashing claims.', 'Greenwashing cases against major brands have seemingly had a tough time making it to trial. In December, plaintiffs voluntarily dropped a class-action greenwashing suit against H&M. In May of last year, the Swedish company also won dismissal of a separate greenwashing case against it.', 'Nike did not return Sourcing Journal’s request for comment.']"

Slow-growing services were also up for grabs, leading to the creation of the stand-alone Kyndryl\xa0business out of IBM's infrastructure services arm."", ""Meanwhile, IBM refocused its mighty assets, talents, and know-how on a small selection of future growth opportunities. After eight years at the helm, Rometty handed the reins to cloud and cognitive software pioneer Arvind Krishna in 2020.

Despite such predictions, the market continues to exhibit robust performance and resilience. The S&P 500 closed out the first quarter of the year with an over 10% gain. BlackRock, Inc.’s (NYSE:BLK) Managing Director, Tony DeSpirito, believes that a pullback won’t be surprising but keeps a bullish view on the rest of the year. He adds that stocks are set to outperform bonds and cash again this year while advising investors some caution with their equity choices. He believes that “the opportunity set for stock picking is the most robust” he has seen in 20 years. Tony DeSpirito’s firm sees some secular trends in the market that provide a bullish view on the broader market for the next three to five years. BlackRock, Inc.’s (NYSE:BLK) Q2 2024 equity market outlook suggests long-term opportunities in artificial intelligence, clean energy (including utilities and EVs), and the healthcare industries.', 'Principal Asset Management’s CIO, George Marris, also sees signs of a healthy future in the markets. In a CNBC interview on April 3, he said that while the recent performance of the stock market was credited to a few stocks, he expects a broadening in the market and favors cyclically exposed stocks. Marris forecasts opportunities in industrials, commodities, and UK-listed companies, along with the Chinese and Japanese markets. Among the foreign companies, George Marris believes that there are several UK-based multinational companies that have a geographic footprint similar to the ones in the US and are trading at cheap multiples. He added that in Japan, his firm sees a significant level of corporate reform due to “societal pressure and domestic activism”.', 'The Oracle of Omaha, Warren Buffett, is also showing confidence in the Japanese market, and his firm is upbeat about five specific stocks. The stocks include ITOCHU Corporation (8001.T), Mitsubishi Corporation (8058.T), Sumitomo Corporation (8053.T), Mitsui & Co., Ltd. (8031.T), and Marubeni Corporation (8002.T). In Berkshire Hathaway’s 2023 annual letter to shareholders, Buffett revealed that the firm increased its stake in all five of these companies in 2023 and owns about 9% of each. He wrote:', '“In certain important ways, all five companies – Itochu, Marubeni, Mitsubishi, Mitsui and Sumitomo – follow shareholder-friendly policies that are much superior to those customarily practiced in the U.S. Since we began our Japanese purchases, each of the five has reduced the number of its outstanding shares at attractive prices.', 'Meanwhile, the managements of all five companies have been far less aggressive about their own compensation than is typical in the United States.

And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up.

Note as well that each of the five is applying only about 1⁄3 of its earnings to dividends. The large sums the five retain are used both to build their many businesses and, to a lesser degree, to repurchase shares. Like Berkshire, the five companies are reluctant to issue shares.\xa0', 'An additional benefit for Berkshire is the possibility that our investment may lead to opportunities for us to partner around the world with five large, well-managed and well-respected companies.

According to several studies, brokerage recommendations have little to no success guiding investors to choose stocks with the most potential for price appreciation.', 'Do you wonder why? As a result of the vested interest of brokerage firms in a stock they cover, their analysts tend to rate it with a strong positive bias. According to our research, brokerage firms assign five ""Strong Buy"" recommendations for every ""Strong Sell"" recommendation.', ""In other words, their interests aren't always aligned with retail investors, rarely indicating where the price of a stock could actually be heading. Therefore, the best use of this information could be validating your own research or an indicator that has proven to be highly successful in predicting a stock's price movement."", ""Zacks Rank, our proprietary stock rating tool with an impressive externally audited track record, categorizes stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), and is an effective indicator of a stock's price performance in the near future. Therefore, using the ABR to validate the Zacks Rank could be an efficient way of making a profitable investment decision."", 'Zacks Rank Should Not Be Confused With ABR', 'Although both Zacks Rank and ABR are displayed in a range of 1-5, they are different measures altogether.', 'Broker recommendations are the sole basis for calculating the ABR, which is typically displayed in decimals (such as 1.28). The Zacks Rank, on the other hand, is a quantitative model designed to harness the power of earnings estimate revisions. It is displayed in whole numbers -- 1 to 5.', ""It has been and continues to be the case that analysts employed by brokerage firms are overly optimistic with their recommendations. Because of their employers' vested interests, these analysts issue more favorable ratings than their research would support, misguiding investors far more often than helping them."", 'On the other hand, earnings estimate revisions are at the core of the Zacks Rank. And empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.', 'In addition, the different Zacks Rank grades are applied proportionately to all stocks for which brokerage analysts provide current-year earnings estimates. In other words, this tool always maintains a balance among its five ranks.', ""Another key difference between the ABR and Zacks Rank is freshness. The ABR is not necessarily up-to-date when you look at it.

Most of the gains came on a single day following the company's financial report for its fiscal first quarter of 2024. Investors were encouraged by its profits despite headwinds for sales."", ""Indeed, there are headwinds. In Q1 (which ended on Feb. 29), McCormick's overall sales volume (when adjusted for foreign-currency fluctuations) was down 1% from the prior-year period. Nevertheless, the top-line number rose 3%, thanks in large part to the company charging higher prices for its products."", ""Higher prices can boost profit margins. Moreover, McCormick's management has been working to cut costs where it can. The combination of these things resulted in nearly an 18% year-over-year increase in its Q1 operating income, which was encouraging for shareholders."", ""For fiscal 2024 as a whole, McCormick's management expects 8% to 10% growth for its operating income, which will take operating income over $1 billion. This was further reason for excitement from investors. And many prominent analysts raised their price targets for McCormick, further supporting its gains during March."", 'McCormick is a boring business -- but a good one. Its products are always in demand, which produces consistent financial results that are appealing to a certain class of investors. Not to be too simplistic, but dividend investors generally prefer a high probability of modest upside with a reliable dividend that grows.', ""McCormick is that. The company just announced its latest quarterly dividend on March 27, marking 100 years without fail of paying a dividend. And it's raised its dividend for 38 straight years."", 'In short, McCormick attracts investors who crave consistency and dividend growth. Therefore, the ability to grow operating income despite weak sales is encouraging. It suggests that the dividend is safe and future raises are in the cards.', ""For its fiscal 2024, McCormick expects sales to be roughly flat year over year. And I've already pointed out its ongoing improvements with operating income. Still, growth is modest for this company, which may limit some of its upside in the near term."", 'That said, by multiple metrics, McCormick stock is trading at a cheaper valuation than its 10-year average. This means that now is an opportune time to pick up shares for investors who crave that aforementioned consistency.', ""Moreover, when taking a longer-term view, it's reasonable to expect better days for McCormick's growth. Right now, consumers are stressed due to inflation. But these macroeconomic issues will ebb and flow over the years, eventually giving way to a better operating environment for McCormick."", 'Should you invest $1,000 in McCormick right now?', 'Before you buy stock in McCormick, consider this:', 'The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\xa010 best stocks for investors to buy now… and McCormick wasn’t one of them.

The fund’s annual expenses total 0.50% of assets under management and it donates all of its net profits to Susan G. Komen for the Cure, a nonprofit organization that works to support people with breast cancer and to fund research on prevention and treatment of the disease.', 'While the fund’s management fees are donated, Taylor said he would profit along with the fund because he is one of its top three shareholders.', 'PINK has been a good performer since it was established, as you can see below.', 'Early in his career, Taylor earned a master’s degree in biotechnology at Johns Hopkins University and worked on gene-therapy research projects at GenVac before earning a master’s in business from the University of Rochester and moving into a money-management career, starting at Oppenheimer. He has managed several healthcare-fund portfolios and health-oriented hedge funds over the course of his career.', 'He described his approach for the Simplify Health Care ETF as “idiosyncratic” — not only for its stock selection but for his ability to move more nimbly than competitors running very large funds in order to right-size investment positions.', 'Before getting to Taylor’s comments on specific companies, here are the fund’s 10 largest holdings:', 'Company', 'Ticker', '% of Simplify Health Care ETF as of March 28', 'Intuitive Surgical Inc.', 'ISRG', '9.5%', 'Sarepta Therapeutics Inc.', 'SRPT', '8.6%', 'Cigna Group', 'CI', '6.5%', 'PureCycle Technologies Inc.', 'PCT', '4.9%', 'Cooper Cos.', 'COO', '4.7%', 'Align Technology Inc.', 'ALGN', '4.6%', 'Merck & Co.', 'MRK', '4.6%', 'Eli Lilly & Co.', 'LLY', '4.6%', 'Shockwave Medical Inc.', 'SWAV', '3.6%', 'Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc.', 'TMO', '3.5%', 'Source: Simplify ETFs', 'PINK’s largest holding is Intuitive Surgical Inc. ISRG. Taylor believes revenue and profit estimates for this company among analysts working for brokerage firms are too low, because the company plans to bring new robotic-surgery equipment to the market this year. Intuitive trades at valuations of 60.4 times the consensus earnings-per-share estimate for the next 12 months among analysts polled by FactSet, and at a forward price-to-sales ratio of 16.8. These are very high when compared with a forward P/E of 21.1 for the S&P 500 SPX and a forward price/sales ratio of 2.7 for the index.', 'Then again, Intuitive’s five-year average forward P/E has been 50.8, according to FactSet. Looking ahead at calendar-year estimates, the company is expected to increase its sales at a compound annual growth rate of 13.9% from 2023 through 2025, with an expected EPS CAGR of 12.9%, based on consensus estimates. Those are compared with an expected sales CAGR of 5.3% and EPS CAGR of 12.3% for the S&P 500.', 'The fund’s second-largest holding is Sarepta Therapeutics Inc. SRPT, which is awaiting Food and Drug Administration approval for its new therapy for Duchenne muscular dystrophy. Taylor believes the stock could double because of the high price tag for the treatment, assuming it is approved. “Sarepta has an opportunity to get a label from the FDA to treat all of DMD, which would turn it into a $5 billion drug for most of the next several years,” he said. The company’s market capitalization is $11.6 billion.', 'If Sarepta fails to gain FDA approval for its DMD treatment, Taylor expects the stock to drop 30%. But he is confident that his thesis will play out. “And since I treat it as if it is my money, we have a large position,” he said. “Nothing that can destroy us, but enough so we can make serious returns.”', 'The third-largest holding in the PINK portfolio is Cigna Group CI, which is one of six companies in the S&P 500 categorized by FactSet as managed-care providers (or health-maintenance organizations). What sets Cigna apart, according to Taylor, is that nearly all of its business comes from commercial clients — employer-sponsored health-insurance plans — while the other five players are focused on Medicare Advantage plans. Cigna’s shares have returned 44% over the past year.', 'Cigna’s stock trades at a low forward P/E of 12.4. It is “cheap because the space is overlooked by investors. There is always this looming threat of national healthcare,” Taylor said. He added that competing managers of healthcare funds “got it wrong” in their analysis of the HMO space, because “they didn’t figure out which one would outperform and size for it.”', 'PINK holds shares of Eli Lilly & Co. LLY, which have soared with the success of the company’s GLP-1 medications to treat diabetes and to help people lose weight. But Taylor is steering clear of Lilly’s largest competitor, Novo Nordisk A/S NVO, because the latter’s “prescription trends for dispensing their GLP-1s are not in line with expectations” in the U.S. market. He also said: “I do believe that Lilly has the superior molecule — better safety and better efficacy.”', 'He sees a long growth runway for GLP-1 medications because they are now covered by Medicare for treatment of diabetes, but are not yet covered for patients who need to lose weight. With so many people at risk for expensive medical problems that can result from obesity, there is potential for a large expansion of this drug category, as Medicare and insurers realize the benefit of covering GLP-1s for more purposes, Taylor said.', 'In healthcare, especially biotechnology, binary events can make investors a lot of money. A company’s share price may soar as it nears expected FDA approval for a new medicine, treatment or device, and it may crash if it fails to gain approval.', 'The Simplify Health Care ETF can have up to 20% of its portfolio invested outside the healthcare sector, and Taylor cited PureCycle Technologies Inc. PCT as an example of such a stock. And it sure is a binary play. The company has a market capitalization of less than $1 billion. It has licensed technology from Procter & Gamble Co. PG that enables recycling of polypropylene.', 'Polypropylene is a commonly used plastic that people often put into recycling bins. Even though it is sorted by waste-management companies, this type of plastic isn’t being recycled. PureCycle expects its facility in Ironton, Ohio, which was built in 2023, to become fully operational this year.', '“[PureCycle] is on the cusp of going massively global, with three plants in Asia, one in Europe and two in the U.S.” planned, Taylor said. He also said that demand for PureCycle’s services was “off the chart” and that the Ironton plant had a “20-year backlog” of business.', 'He said it remained to be seen if [PureCycle’s] recycling of polypropylene into pellets for industrial use would eventually result in profit margins superior to those of manufacturers making new plastic from petroleum. But he also called PureCycle “a solo pure-play with an [intellectual property] moat.”', '“[PureCycle] is in PINK because I expect this to be a 50-bagger over the next decade. There is nothing else like it,” Taylor said.

(NYSE:MA) has proven to be one of the best growth compounding stocks over the years. With the company set to enter the Chinese domestic market, it looks poised to continue to perform well.', ""Mastercard is one of the world's largest global payment networks, where it authorizes, clears and settles transactions made through credit, debit and prepaid cards, as well as digital payments. It can also handle automated clearing house transactions. Its brands include Mastercard, Maestro and Cirrus."", 'Warning! GuruFocus has detected 7 Warning Sign with MA.', 'The company earns money by collecting a percentage of the gross dollar value on its branded cards that run through its payment network. It also earning fees from value-added services it provides.', ""Mastercard is the third-largest credit card processor in world, behind Visa (NYSE:V) and China's UnionPay, and the second largest in the U.S. Together Visa, UnionPay and Mastercard handle nearly 97% of all global transactions."", 'Being part of a triopoly, and a duopoly in many places in the world, Mastercard is in an envious position. While it can gain or lose market share, in general it benefits from the natural rise of global consumer spending. It also benefits from the secular shift away from cash toward electronic payments, especially in emerging markets, as well as increased cross-border spending.', 'Meanwhile, the company has had an edge over larger rival Visa in Europe. Mastercard has taken share across the pond as Visa has had to modernize its European network after buying it in 2016. The company has been able to secure portfolios from large European banks over the last few years, and has greatly closed the gap between the two companies in Europe.', 'Looking ahead, China is an opportunity for the company as well. Mastercard recently had a joint venture in the country receive approval for domestic bank card clearing. It has operated in the country on the cross-border side of the business and will now look to make inroads with Chinese banks and credit card issuers. Earlier this year, the company also began to enable inbound acceptance from Tencent and Alipay wallets. This is important because China is largely a digital payment society and it allows international travelers to pay at QR code payment points like locals.', ""I would not expect Mastercard to gain a lot of market share in China, but given how massive the Chinese economy is, even capturing a small percentage could be meaningful. China's gross domestic product is over $18 trillion, with over half of that from consumer consumption. Capturing just a 1% market share with a 1.50% swipe fee would be about a $1.30 billion opportunity."", 'The company has also been very good at growing its value-added services business, which included things such as fraud protection, identity verification and data analytics. In the fourth quarter, value-added services was its fastest-growing segment, with revenue rising 19%, or 17% in constant currencies, to $2.66 billion, outpacing the 9% growth, or 7% in constant currencies, to $3.89 billion of its payment network.', 'Looking to continue to grow the value-added service side of its business, Mastercard is investing in generative artificial intelligence to help in the areas of personalized real-time assistance and data analytics. Among the products it is introducing are an AI-driven conversational shopping tool and a personalized AI assistant to business owners.', ""When it comes to risk, the global economy is front and center. Mastercard's growth comes from increasing consumption growth, so if that grows less than expected or falls, it would be a negative for the company. The company also said it is monitoring risks from credit availability and delinquency rates, which could cause credit card issuers to pullback issuing cards or consumers spending less."", 'There also could be some competitive risk with Capital One Financial (NYSE:COF) acquiring Discover Financial Services (NYSE:DFS), which runs a small payments network. Capital One is a Mastercard client, so it could potentially look to issue more cards from Discover and run it through its soon to be acquired payment network.', 'Asked about the deal at a recent Citi Fintech conference last month, Mastercard President of the Americas Linda Kirkpatrick said:', ""Our relationship with Capital One has been a strong and important one for many, many years, both in the context of their cards business as well as their services business. That is true before the announcement that remains true after the announcement. You've heard them say publicly, and we've talked to them right after they made their announcement and they value the relationship that they have with us as a network. They value our services and our international acceptance and our brand. And they don't anticipate that changing. So, I believe that for the long term, we will be partnering with Capital One across a variety of topics. But what I really believe is this is a very strong demonstration that competition within our markets is incredibly robust. Whether it's this announcement or the proliferation of alternative payment methods, buy now, pay later providers, digital wallets, digital currencies, account-to-account, real-time payments, competition has never been more robust, and that is clear. But with respect to Capital One, there's a lot that still remains to be decided and concluded. I am confident that we will work with them into the long run."", 'Clearly the company expects to remain a Capital One customer, but it also wants to give the illusion there is a lot of competition in the space. And the reason behind that can be seen on the regulation front.', 'Mastercard and Visa just settled a $30 billion anti-trust lawsuit with the U.S. government. In addition to the fine, the companies agreed to reduce swipe fees by at least 4 basis points over the next three years and to for them to average 7 basis points lower of the next five years. If Mastercard extended the swipe fee reductions globally, it looks like it would only be about an $11 million impact to yearly revenue.', 'Mastercard trades over 26 times the 2024 consensus adjusted Ebitda of $17.27 billion and 23 times the 2025 consensus of $19.76 billion.', 'The company is projected to grow its revenue 12% in 2024 and about 12.60% in 2025.', 'Mastercard trades at a premium to Visa, which stands at around 21.50 times 2024 Ebitda, while seeing just slightly less revenue growth at 10%.', 'Prior to the pandemic, Mastercard stock traded at an enterprise value/Ebitda multiple of between 17.50 and 30. Based on that range, a fair value for the stock based on 2025 Ebitda would be between $370 and $633.', 'Projecting 12% growth annual growth out the next 10 years, keeping its adjusted Ebitda margins and placing a 20 times multiple on the stock would give you a $1,020 stock. Discount that back using a 5% rate would give you a $626 present valuation on the stock.', 'Mastercard is a tremendous business that should see secular trends working in its favor for years to come. Meanwhile, it has an opportunity to bolster its business even more by getting into the domestic China card clearing business and through further innovations in valued-added services.', 'The company is a great growth compounder that consistently sees its revenue climb in the low to high teens during typical economic environments. Thus, while the stock is not traditionally cheap, it looks attractive over the long term.', 'This article first appeared on GuruFocus.']"

(NYSE:VZ) for its dividend will need to make their move shortly, as the stock is about to trade ex-dividend. The ex-dividend date is usually set to be one business day before the record date which is the cut-off date on which you must be present on the company's books as a shareholder in order to receive the dividend. The ex-dividend date is an important date to be aware of as any purchase of the stock made on or after this date might mean a late settlement that doesn't show on the record date. Accordingly, Verizon Communications investors that purchase the stock on or after the 9th of April will not receive the dividend, which will be paid on the 1st of May."", ""The company's next dividend payment will be US$0.665 per share. Last year, in total, the company distributed US$2.66 to shareholders. Based on the last year's worth of payments, Verizon Communications has a trailing yield of 6.2% on the current stock price of US$42.84. If you buy this business for its dividend, you should have an idea of whether Verizon Communications's dividend is reliable and sustainable. We need to see whether the dividend is covered by earnings and if it's growing."", ' See our latest analysis for Verizon Communications ', ""Dividends are typically paid from company earnings. If a company pays more in dividends than it earned in profit, then the dividend could be unsustainable. Last year, Verizon Communications paid out 96% of its income as dividends, which is above a level that we're comfortable with, especially if the company needs to reinvest in its business. That said, even highly profitable companies sometimes might not generate enough cash to pay the dividend, which is why we should always check if the dividend is covered by cash flow. It paid out 85% of its free cash flow as dividends, which is within usual limits but will limit the company's ability to lift the dividend if there's no growth."", ""It's good to see that while Verizon Communications's dividends were not well covered by profits, at least they are affordable from a cash perspective. Still, if the company continues paying out such a high percentage of its profits, the dividend could be at risk if business turns sour."", ""Click here to see the company's payout ratio, plus analyst estimates of its future dividends."", ""Businesses with shrinking earnings are tricky from a dividend perspective. Investors love dividends, so if earnings fall and the dividend is reduced, expect a stock to be sold off heavily at the same time. Verizon Communications's earnings per share have fallen at approximately 6.0% a year over the previous five years. Such a sharp decline casts doubt on the future sustainability of the dividend."", ""Another key way to measure a company's dividend prospects is by measuring its historical rate of dividend growth. In the last 10 years, Verizon Communications has lifted its dividend by approximately 2.6% a year on average. The only way to pay higher dividends when earnings are shrinking is either to pay out a larger percentage of profits, spend cash from the balance sheet, or borrow the money. Verizon Communications is already paying out 96% of its profits, and with shrinking earnings we think it's unlikely that this dividend will grow quickly in the future."", ""Is Verizon Communications an attractive dividend stock, or better left on the shelf? Earnings per share have been shrinking in recent times. Worse, Verizon Communications's paying out a majority of its earnings and more than half its free cash flow. Positive cash flows are good news but it's not a good combination. It's not the most attractive proposition from a dividend perspective, and we'd probably give this one a miss for now."", ""So if you're still interested in Verizon Communications despite it's poor dividend qualities, you should be well informed on some of the risks facing this stock. For example, we've found 5 warning signs for Verizon Communications that we recommend you consider before investing in the business."", ""If you're in the market for strong dividend payers, we recommend checking our selection of top dividend stocks."", 'Have feedback on this article?

But for investors looking to buy a value play in the AI space right now, Dell Technologies (NYSE: DELL) looks like an ideal stock pick."", ""Dell's business consists of two segments. The first is infrastructure solutions, through which the company sells storage and server solutions along with networking products and services. The second segment is client solutions, which includes sales of workstations, personal computers (PCs), and other peripherals."", 'The good news for Dell investors is that both these segments are on track to win big from the rising adoption of AI.', ""The company's infrastructure business is getting a nice bump from sales of AI servers, which are used for mounting chips from Nvidia and others. In the fourth quarter of Dell's fiscal 2024 (which ended Feb. 2), its infrastructure solutions segment delivered $9.3 billion in revenue. Though that was a drop of 6% year over year, it was a gain of 6% sequentially thanks to the growing demand for AI-optimized servers."", ""Dell shipped $800 million worth of AI servers during the quarter, and that metric is likely to head higher as orders for AI servers increased 40% sequentially last quarter, boosting Dell's AI server backlog to $2.9 billion. Its AI server-related order book should keep getting fatter -- according to a forecast from Global Market Insights, the AI server market's revenue will jump from $38 billion in 2023 to $177 billion in 2032."", 'The company is already witnessing a ""strong interest in orders"" for next-generation chips from Nvidia and Advanced Micro Devices, which is another indication that its AI-specific server orders are set to move higher.', 'Similarly, Dell expects the advent of AI to drive a turnaround in its client solutions business as well, which has been under stress thanks to declining PC sales. Client solutions revenue was down 12% year over year in the fiscal fourth quarter to $11.7 billion. However, the sequential decline was just 5%.', '""PCs will become even more essential as most day-to-day work with AI will be done on the PC,"" Dell COO Jeffrey W. Clarke said on the Feb. 29 earnings call. The company already announced a new lineup of commercial PCs with integrated AI functionalities to capitalize on this opportunity. This is a smart thing to do, as shipments of AI-enabled PCs are expected to take off this year.', 'Market research firm Canalys predicts that AI-enabled PC shipments will hit 48 million units in 2024, 100 million units in 2025, and 205 million units in 2028. Canalys also points out that AI PCs are likely to carry price premiums of 10% to 15% over traditional PCs. Given that Dell is the third-largest PC original equipment manufacturer and controlled just over 15% of this market in 2023, it is positioned to benefit from this fast-growing niche.', 'These AI-related catalysts explain why analysts have been significantly raising their revenue growth expectations for Dell of late.', ""Dell's top-line performance is anticipated to improve over the next three fiscal years, and that revenue growth is expected to filter down to the bottom line as well."", ""Dell is currently trading at just under 25 times trailing earnings. Its forward earnings multiple is even cheaper at 15.7. For comparison, the tech-heavy Nasdaq-100 index has a trailing earnings multiple of 31 and forward earnings multiple of 27. Assuming the company does achieve $9.53 per share in earnings in fiscal 2027 and trades at 27 times earnings at that time (using the Nasdaq-100's forward earnings multiple as a proxy for tech stocks), its stock price could jump to $257 in three years."", ""That would be a 100% jump from current levels. Dell has already gained 210% in the past year, but don't be surprised to see this tech stock deliver eye-popping gains in the future as well thanks to its improving AI credentials.

A few of those stocks recently have faltered, and now, the focus is on the ""Fab Four"" -- the four members of the Magnificent Seven that continue to roar higher. These market winners are Nvidia, Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: META), Amazon, and Microsoft.', 'Nvidia is the biggest gainer of them all, climbing 80% so far this year, and still represents a great stock to buy. But a better bargain exists among these Fab Four stocks. This particular player offers you a solid earnings track record, a strong moat, exposure to the high-growth area of artificial intelligence (AI), and promising long-term prospects. So forget Nvidia... this Fab Four stock is the one to scoop up right now.', ""I'm talking about Meta, a company almost everyone is familiar with, thanks to its family of popular social media apps including Facebook, Messenger, Instagram, and WhatsApp. More than 3.1 billion people use at least one of Meta's apps every day -- so it's no surprise advertisers flock to the platform to connect with these potential customers."", ""Advertising makes up the lion's share of Meta's revenue -- more than 95% of the total of $134 billion last year. And thanks to the company's strong moat (or competitive advantage), this is unlikely to change. It's difficult to switch to another social media platform knowing that all your contacts may not be there. This keeps fans loyal, and Meta's work to make its platforms more dynamic, fun, and practical could reinforce this loyalty."", ""This brings me to the company's investment in AI -- an area Meta says will be its biggest investment theme this year. The company already has brought Meta AI, an advanced conversational assistant, to its family of apps, but it isn't stopping there. Chief Executive Officer Mark Zuckerberg says he wants to roll out AI across Meta's products and services so that all Meta users can rely on AI to accomplish their goals -- from leisure to business."", ""That's why Meta is ramping up its computer power and aims to bring on board 600,000 graphics processing units (GPUs) by the end of the year. GPUs power AI models and platforms. For example, they drive the training and inference of large language models (LLMs) so that these tools can successfully solve complex problems."", ""Meta's developed its own LLM called Llama, and now Llama 3 is in training. Llama is the technology behind Meta AI and other AI products at Meta, but the company isn't keeping it all to itself. By making it open source -- or open to general use -- Meta gains valuable feedback to improve its technology and gains many users -- putting its software on the path to becoming an industry standard."", 'Down the road, Meta likely will continue to be a social media giant and, along with that, could also become an AI leader. Meanwhile, the company\'s financial position should allow it to invest in the technology needed to reach these goals. Meta made moves last year in what Zuckerberg calls the ""year of efficiency"" to get there, and in the latest quarterly report, Meta announced its first-ever dividend, showing its confidence that it has what it takes to fund growth and reward shareholders.', 'How much do you have to pay to get access to such a player? Not as much as you might think. Today, Meta is trading for only 24x forward earnings estimates, making it the cheapest of the Fab Four by this measure.', ""As I mentioned above, Nvidia still has plenty of growth ahead but its stock isn't the only game in town. Today, Meta is cheaper and offers you the potential of a winning AI story, along with the solidity of a highly profitable social media business. That means right now, I'd forget Nvidia and buy shares of this Fab Four bargain instead."", 'Should you invest $1,000 in Meta Platforms right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Meta Platforms, consider this:', 'The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\xa010 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Meta Platforms wasn’t one of them.

The U.K. chip designer listed its shares at $51, and they've already more than doubled to about $125 over the past six months."", ""Yet Arm's stock didn't blast off right away. Instead, it hovered near its IPO price for the first two months as investors scoffed at its slowing growth and high valuation. However, its growth accelerated again, the bulls rushed back, and Arm's market cap climbed to nearly $130 billion. Could it keep rallying to become a trillion-dollar stock by 2035?"", ""Arm was founded in 1990 as a joint venture between Apple, Acorn Computers, and VLSI Technology. It aimed to develop a new chip design that could challenge Intel's\xa0dominant x86 chip architecture."", ""By prioritizing battery life and technical flexibility over raw horsepower, Arm carved out its niche in smaller handheld devices instead of PCs and servers. Today, more than 95% of the world's smartphones use Arm-based chips. Intel, which stubbornly tried to shrink down its x86 CPUs for mobile devices, was driven out of that lucrative market."", ""Arm doesn't manufacture its own chips. It only licenses its designs to chipmakers like Apple, Qualcomm, and MediaTek. Nvidia also licenses Arm designs for its Tegra CPUs. That asset-light business model, along with its pricing power in the mobile market, enables Arm to keep its gross margin in the mid-90s percentages."", 'Arm initially went public back in 1998, but it was acquired by the Japanese conglomerate SoftBank in 2016. SoftBank then nearly sold Arm to Nvidia for $40 billion before antitrust regulators scuttled the deal in 2022. After the attempted sale collapsed, SoftBank spun off Arm in a new IPO but retained a 90.6% stake in the company.', ""Arm's revenue increased 33% in fiscal 2022 (which ended in March 2022) as smartphone makers pumped out more 5G devices, but dipped 1% in fiscal 2023 after the 5G upgrade cycle slowed down. In the first nine months of fiscal 2024, Arm's revenue grew 13% year over year as the stabilization of the smartphone market, its growth in the cloud and automotive markets, and higher-royalty AI-optimized chip designs boosted its royalty revenue."", ""For the full year, Arm expects its revenue to rise between 18% and 20%. From fiscal 2024 to fiscal 2026, analysts predict its revenue will increase at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 22%. That growth rate is impressive, but it might not be enough for a stock that is already trading at about 40 times this year's sales."", ""Arm is trading at such a high price-to-sales ratio because it's being perceived as an artificial intelligence (AI) stock. But investors shouldn't casually toss Arm in the same basket as Nvidia. Arm is certainly generating higher royalties from its latest Armv9 designs -- which can be used to power AI features across premium smartphones, PCs, and even servers -- but they simply aren't as important for processing complex AI tasks as Nvidia's powerful GPUs."", ""Assuming Arm still trades at 40 times sales, meets analysts' expectations, and increases its revenue at a CAGR of 20% from fiscal 2026 to fiscal 2035, it could reach a $1 trillion valuation by that final year. That might seem like an achievable goal, but I doubt it can maintain that nosebleed price-to-sales ratio after investors' interest in AI stocks eventually cools off."", 'If Arm hits those targets and trades at 20 times sales by fiscal 2035, it would still be worth $500 billion. That would represent a four-bagger gain from its current price, but it might disappoint investors who were expecting even bigger returns.', 'Should you invest $1,000 in Arm Holdings right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Arm Holdings, consider this:', 'The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\xa010 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Arm Holdings wasn’t one of them.

Further, the company's ROE is similar to the industry average of 13%. Despite the modest returns, Travelers Companies' five year net income growth was quite low, averaging at only 3.8%.

So there might be other factors at play here which could potentially be hampering growth. For example, the business has faced some headwinds."", ""Moreover, Travelers Companies has been paying dividends for at least ten years or more suggesting that management must have perceived that the shareholders prefer dividends over earnings growth. Upon studying the latest analysts' consensus data, we found that the company's future payout ratio is expected to drop to 20% over the next three years.

Why do you think in the end he didn't win? Was it that Disney that it's full court press was successful using its IP to convince shareholders to vote on its behalf? Was it that Iger was already making the right moves? What do you think went on there?"", ""LAURA MARTIN: I think there's three things. The Disney brand is iconic, and to have hostility in the boardroom is really off brand for Disney, too. 95% of shareholders voted for Bob Iger, which is 100% of shareholders that weren't Nelson Peltz. So there is a lot of faith in Bob Iger as a leader. That's the second thing."", ""And then third, Nelson Peltz has no entertainment experience.

What are the catalysts ahead lower that you see that are going to move this name even still higher?"", ""LAURA MARTIN: Right. So I really like the ESPN-Warner Brothers-Fox joint venture is going after 10 million cord cutters that currently Disney earns no money from. So I like that as a catalyst. I really like streaming losses are now-- they're going to hit profitability in the September quarter instead of the December quarter. And I definitely talk to a lot of investors who are skeptical about that ever happening. So if it happens, I think that is a catalyst for the stock."", ""Continued margin expansion at the parks, parks are now a third of revenue and 3/4 of profitability. So parks have to continue to do well to drive earnings per share growth. And I expect that they will. So I would say those are the three key things I'm looking for in '24 and '25 to keep these shares moving to the upside.""]"

Unfortunately, these high risk investments often have little probability of ever paying off, and many investors pay a price to learn their lesson. Loss making companies can act like a sponge for capital - so investors should be cautious that they're not throwing good money after bad."", ""If this kind of company isn't your style, you like companies that generate revenue, and even earn profits, then you may well be interested in F5 (NASDAQ:FFIV). While profit isn't the sole metric that should be considered when investing, it's worth recognising businesses that can consistently produce it."", ' Check out our latest analysis for F5 ', 'Generally, companies experiencing growth in earnings per share (EPS) should see similar trends in share price. That makes EPS growth an attractive quality for any company. Impressively, F5 has grown EPS by 17% per year, compound, in the last three years. If growth like this continues on into the future, then shareholders will have plenty to smile about.', ""One way to double-check a company's growth is to look at how its revenue, and earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) margins are changing. F5 shareholders can take confidence from the fact that EBIT margins are up from 14% to 22%, and revenue is growing. Ticking those two boxes is a good sign of growth, in our book."", ""You can take a look at the company's revenue and earnings growth trend, in the chart below.

But we do take comfort from the fact that they are investors in the company. With a whopping US$81m worth of shares as a group, insiders have plenty riding on the company's success. That's certainly enough to let shareholders know that management will be very focussed on long term growth."", ""It's good to see that insiders are invested in the company, but are remuneration levels reasonable? Well, based on the CEO pay, you'd argue that they are indeed. For companies with market capitalisations over US$8.0b, like F5, the median CEO pay is around US$13m."", ""F5's CEO took home a total compensation package worth US$11m in the year leading up to September 2023. That is actually below the median for CEO's of similarly sized companies. CEO remuneration levels are not the most important metric for investors, but when the pay is modest, that does support enhanced alignment between the CEO and the ordinary shareholders. Generally, arguments can be made that reasonable pay levels attest to good decision-making."", ""If you believe that share price follows earnings per share you should definitely be delving further into F5's strong EPS growth. If you still have your doubts, remember too that company insiders have a considerable investment aligning themselves with the shareholders and CEO pay is quite modest compared to similarly sized companiess. This may only be a fast rundown, but the key takeaway is that F5 is worth keeping an eye on. Of course, just because F5 is growing does not mean it is undervalued.

But for income investors, generating consistent cash flow from each of your liquid investments is your primary focus."", ""While cash flow can come from bond interest or interest from other types of investments, income investors hone in on dividends. A dividend is that coveted distribution of a company's earnings paid out to shareholders, and investors often view it by its dividend yield, a metric that measures the dividend as a percent of the current stock price. Many academic studies show that dividends account for significant portions of long-term returns, with dividend contributions exceeding one-third of total returns in many cases."", 'Colgate-Palmolive in Focus', ""Based in New York, Colgate-Palmolive (CL) is in the Consumer Staples sector, and so far this year, shares have seen a price change of 11.73%. The consumer products maker is paying out a dividend of $0.48 per share at the moment, with a dividend yield of 2.16% compared to the Soap and Cleaning Materials industry's yield of 2.32% and the S&P 500's yield of 1.54%."", ""In terms of dividend growth, the company's current annualized dividend of $1.92 is up 0.5% from last year. Over the last 5 years, Colgate-Palmolive has increased its dividend 5 times on a year-over-year basis for an average annual increase of 2.79%. Future dividend growth will depend on earnings growth as well as payout ratio, which is the proportion of a company's annual earnings per share that it pays out as a dividend. Colgate-Palmolive's current payout ratio is 59%. This means it paid out 59% of its trailing 12-month EPS as dividend."", 'Looking at this fiscal year, CL expects solid earnings growth.

However, not all companies offer a quarterly payout.', ""For instance, it's a rare occurrence when a tech start-up or big growth business offers their shareholders a dividend. It's more common to see larger companies with more established profits give out dividends. During periods of rising interest rates, income investors must be mindful that high-yielding stocks tend to struggle.

Firstly, we'd want to identify a growing return on capital employed (ROCE) and then alongside that, an ever-increasing base of capital employed. Put simply, these types of businesses are compounding machines, meaning they are continually reinvesting their earnings at ever-higher rates of return. However, after investigating Juniper Networks (NYSE:JNPR), we don't think it's current trends fit the mold of a multi-bagger."", ""For those who don't know, ROCE is a measure of a company's yearly pre-tax profit (its return), relative to the capital employed in the business. To calculate this metric for Juniper Networks, this is the formula:"", 'Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)', '0.077 = US$568m ÷ (US$9.5b - US$2.1b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to December 2023).', ""Thus, Juniper Networks has an ROCE of 7.7%.  Even though it's in line with the industry average of 8.3%, it's still a low return by itself."", ' See our latest analysis for Juniper Networks ', ""In the above chart we have measured Juniper Networks' prior ROCE against its prior performance, but the future is arguably more important. If you'd like to see what analysts are forecasting going forward, you should check out our free analyst report for Juniper Networks ."", ""Over the past five years, Juniper Networks' ROCE and capital employed have both remained mostly flat. Businesses with these traits tend to be mature and steady operations because they're past the growth phase. So unless we see a substantial change at Juniper Networks in terms of ROCE and additional investments being made, we wouldn't hold our breath on it being a multi-bagger. With fewer investment opportunities, it makes sense that Juniper Networks has been paying out a decent 39% of its earnings to shareholders. Given the business isn't reinvesting in itself, it makes sense to distribute a portion of earnings among shareholders."", ""In summary, Juniper Networks isn't compounding its earnings but is generating stable returns on the same amount of capital employed. Although the market must be expecting these trends to improve because the stock has gained 58% over the last five years. But if the trajectory of these underlying trends continue, we think the likelihood of it being a multi-bagger from here isn't high."", ""Juniper Networks does have some risks though, and we've spotted   4 warning signs for Juniper Networks  that you might be interested in."", 'For those who like to invest in solid companies, check out this free list of companies with solid balance sheets and high returns on equity.', 'Have feedback on this article?

Those barriers have economic and educational impacts, both immediate, and intergenerational."", 'In 2022, 62% of men around the world regularly used the Internet, while only 57% of women did. In the U.S., those who lack digital skills earn lower incomes - 92% of job postings now require basic digital skills and jobs requiring even one digital skill can earn an average of $8,000 more a year compared to jobs that do not require them. We will not be able to close the gender pay gap unless we acknowledge the need to close the gender digital divide by helping to empower women with the skills and tools necessary to get online.', 'For many families, a tight budget can be a barrier between them and a reliable home connection. That\'s why over a decade ago, Comcast introduced our Internet Essentials program (IE) as a low-cost solution for qualifying households, offering home Internet for as low as $9.99 a month. In D.C., I met Alisha, a single mother of two, who was able to get her family online through IE. With her new home connectivity, she pursued her associate degree to advance her career, and her sons were able to do their homework and apply to college. For her family, their home Internet was what Alisha described as a ""game changer,"" providing access to education that puts them on a path to success.', ""Access to a device is another formidable barrier. In Miami, I recently met Fani, an immigrant from Honduras, whose 11-year-old son, Yariel, was unable to do his schoolwork at home because the family did not have a working laptop. Lacking access to a device that can get online is a common barrier to connectivity, but for Fani, the solution was only a partnership away. Over the last four years, through NBCUniversal Telemundo Enterprise's El Poder En Ti initiative and Comcast's Project UP, we've donated a total of 10,000 laptops to Latino-serving organizations - the last 150 were given to Amigos for Kids, a community partner that runs Yariel's after school program. There, he received a free laptop and he can now complete his schoolwork from the comfort of home. For Yariel, a free laptop opens the door to endless opportunity; for Fani, it's one less stressor for her to bear."", 'Another barrier to connectivity is the lack of digital skills. One solution sits with digital navigators-these trusted community members are trained to help get people connected, operate their computer, and navigate the Internet.

Through strategic partnerships, Comcast has supported the deployment of thousands of digital navigators in communities across the country.

Then come the commercials—a very on-the-mark pitch from the local pet adoption center and another for fire insurance.', 'This ad utopia, at least from a marketer’s perspective, is possible thanks to artificial intelligence being adopted by television companies. AI figures out the emotional vibe in a show or movie and then automatically inserts commercials aligned with that feeling.', 'It’s just one of the many ways that legacy TV, whose business is under assault from streaming, is using AI to compete with the likes of Netflix and Amazon Prime Video, which now show ads to some users.', '“Anything that enables them to convince advertisers that their platforms are still a good place to reach a wide cross-section of consumers—and enables advertisers to look for efficiency in the same way they have been trained to on digital platforms—is good for them,” said Kate Scott-Dawkins, global president of business intelligence at media buyer GroupM.', 'Legacy broadcasters including NBCUniversal, Disney, and Warner Bros. Discovery are walking a tightrope. Once the alphas of advertising, their traditional television offerings were the only way for marketers to connect their brands to shows driving the cultural zeitgeist while reaching a mass audience.', 'Then Google, Meta, and other digital media arrived and offered the ability to target individual consumers online, attracting significant spending from television. Now streaming is also starting to steal ad dollars from traditional TV.', 'In some cases, the winners and losers are difficult to differentiate. Since streaming platforms and linear TV channels are sometimes owned by the same parent company (Paramount Global owns both streamer Paramount+ and television channel CBS, for example), revenue from both businesses can end up in the same place.', 'Still, that leaves legacy media companies stuck in a balancing act of growing their streaming businesses without killing their linear ones. They must go where consumers are moving—to streaming—without abandoning the big money that advertisers are still willing to pay for premium TV like sports and news.', 'Streamers like Netflix and Amazon Prime Video, which have introduced lower-priced subscription tiers that come with commercials, don’t face the same problem because they don’t have to worry about growth on streaming cannibalizing other parts of their businesses.', 'Last month, NBCUniversal announced a push to use AI to divide its audiences into different categories. The technology scans shows to determine the behaviors and emotions featured in specific episodes of a larger series that are shown through both streaming and linear television. The AI helps place ads that align with the mood while also slicing and dicing the data collected to help NBCUniversal better learn what individual households like to watch. Ultimately, those households are placed in one of 300 buckets based on their viewing habits. The company can then let marketers target only the groups they think are most receptive to their products, chief data officer John Lee told Fortune at a press briefing last month.', 'For example, a household may frequently watch shows that are heavy on family values, like drama series This Is Us and sitcom Extended Family. NBCUniversal can then tell advertisers which specific users like such content, and advertisers can show those viewers an ad with the same underlying message or create a new one for that purpose. They can also insert the ad into specific episodes that display those values.', 'In the future, generative AI may also be able to help marketers quickly create ads with specific emotional ties to appear for each of the hundreds of audience segments, Lee said.\xa0', 'The general pitch NBCUniversal is making to advertisers is that they can now target viewers with far more precision, as Google and Facebook parent Meta have been able to do for years. It’s a big change from the past, when TV companies could merely promise marketers that their commercials would be shown during a show that is popular with a particular demographic.', 'In January, NBCUniversal introduced another new tool that helps marketers find their target audiences across both streaming properties and traditional television. Called One Platform Total Audience, or OPTA, the tool can take an advertiser’s budget and information about the audience they want to reach, and determine exactly where ads should go to reach that audience—whether it be The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon on cable or Love Island on Peacock.', 'OPTA taps into NBCUniversal’s first-party data and additional data from the advertiser, as well as machine learning and predictive analytics, to create the media plan.', '“We are really positioning ourselves to not only look at the future of streaming, but of television, which includes streaming and traditional television,” Karen Kovacs, NBCUniversal’s president of client partnerships and national offices in the ad sales division, told Fortune. “The future isn’t either/or. It is both.”', 'As for Disney, it premiered an AI product in February for reading the emotion of content, called Disney’s Magic Words. While NBCUniversal’s AI identifies the mood of an episode, Disney’s reads it at the scene level. This capability lets marketers place ads based on the mood of what a viewer saw within the past few minutes. An ad for a restaurant, for example, might appear just after the characters eat a meal, or a dramatic ad for a car could follow an action-packed car chase.', '“This will be the first time we are taking moments from content and trying to match them into advertising opportunities,” said Alex Combs, Disney’s vice president of ad product development.', '“Traditionally, you’ve seen companies look at context at a much more aggregate level—a show or a channel, comedies or dramas,” he told Fortune. “That’s had some value in the past, but when you dig into it deeper, there’s a lot of moments within those series. The more precise we can get, the more we can drive relevancy.”', 'Disney’s Magic Words only applies to content on Disney+ and Hulu, not its television channels like ABC and ESPN. Meanwhile, NBCUniversal’s AI scans content across all its linear and streaming properties including MSNBC, E!, and Peacock.', 'Disney also recently expanded its in-house marketplace for selling programmatic ads—or automatically placed ads—to make sales on Disney+ and Hulu easier for media buyers. By doing this, Disney can be “prime-positioned and fully ready to go” on streaming if its linear business ever stops producing profits, said Joe Araujo, who manages programmatic buying for Dallas-based agency Media Culture.', 'These AI tools may give legacy media a leg up on the pure streamers, because it’s still early days for advertising on Netflix and Amazon Prime Video, according to Geoffrey Calabrese, chief investment officer of the North American division of Omnicom Media Group.', 'But dominant search and social media players still have the advantage, said GroupM’s Scott-Dawkins: “Companies like Google and Meta are much further along. They’ve been using AI in their ad platforms for a very long time.” Google’s AI can pull text from within a website and rewrite the website’s headline to appear more similar to a user’s search query, for example. While Meta uses AI to predict the kinds of ads a user is interested in, it also offers\xa0AI tools to help marketers create images and write text for ads.', 'Still, Scott-Dawkins said, advertisers want choices: “The fact that there are companies outside of Meta and Google that can offer great targeting and great attribution is better for advertisers in terms of choice and competition and innovation.”', 'How much Warner Bros. Discovery uses AI in its advertising operations is unclear. It declined to comment.', 'But Warner Bros., the studio behind Harry Potter and Barbie, has publicly disclosed that it works with ad measurement companies employing AI, including LoopMe and Pilotly, to determine the effectiveness of campaigns. It also uses marketing tech company the Trade Desk to provide better-targeted commercials using AI. Still, Warner Bros. hasn’t announced any proprietary AI tools for advertisers. Based on public statements from its ad team, the company appears to have focused instead in recent years on launching the ad tier for Max, its streaming platform that replaced HBO Max in 2023.', 'Paramount Global similarly uses technology from the Trade Desk, but it hasn’t disclosed any AI tools it has developed for advertisers. It did not respond to requests for comment.', 'Fox, meanwhile, has been scanning the context of its shows and providing that data to advertisers in real time so they can place relevant ads for two years, though it declined to be interviewed for this story. For its local television business, Fox last year partnered with video creation company Waymark to let advertisers in 17 local markets use AI to produce commercials.', 'Generative AI isn’t dominating the advertising space yet, but there is room for huge industry impact in the coming years, experts said. Companies are beginning to digitally add brand images into videos after they have been filmed, which could change how studios make product placement deals. A video-generation tool could also change the background of a car commercial, for example, to reflect the city skyline where the ad is being shown.', '“You’re still advertising a car,” Scott-Dawkins said. “But technology lets you take it a step further.”', 'Correction, April 3, 2024: A previous version of this article misstated the chronology of Disney in-house marketplace for selling programmatic ads.

Is It a Buy?,Motley Fool,https://finance.yahoo.com/m/1e2a41e5-2bc0-3a0c-8da3-3d787bbbcdd9/this-ultra-high-yield.html,1712232900,STORY,"['EPD', 'DVN']","[""The big attraction at Enterprise Products Partners (NYSE: EPD) is the master limited partnership's (MLP's) huge 6.8% yield. But a high yield alone doesn't make an investment a good choice for dividend investors. All you have to do is look at high-yield Devon Energy's (NYSE: DVN) dividend history, and you can see that. Here's why 2023 proved that Enterprise Products Partners, and its high yield, is a dream come true for conservative dividend investors interested in the energy sector."", 'The term energy sector is a broad catch-all phrase. There are actually three segments to the energy sector: the upstream, midstream, and downstream. The differences are really important to understand if you are looking to own a consistent dividend payer.', 'The upstream segment produces oil and natural gas. These are commodities prone to swift and often dramatic price changes. Since selling these commodities is what drives financial results in the upstream sector, producers like Devon Energy tend to have volatile earnings. The downstream is where chemical and refining companies live. Oil and natural gas are inputs, so these businesses can benefit from low energy prices (high energy prices, meanwhile, are a headwind). However, the products they make out of oil and natural gas are often commodities, too. So, earnings can be just as volatile in the downstream as in the upstream.', 'The midstream is different. The midstream is filled with companies that own the energy infrastructure, like pipelines, that moves oil and natural gas, and the products into which they get turned, around the world. This is where Enterprise Products Partners operates, with one of the largest portfolios of energy infrastructure in North America. It largely charges fees for the use of its assets, so demand for energy is more important than the price of the commodities going through its system.', 'That changes the dividend equation in a very important way. With reliable cash flows, Enterprise can afford to pay out more cash to unitholders. And it can more comfortably increase distributions as its business grows via capital investments, acquisitions, and contractual price increases. At this point, Enterprise has increased its distribution annually for 25 consecutive years at a compound annual growth rate of 7% (more recent increases have been in the low to mid single digits, which is probably a more realistic run rate).', ""That's all big-picture stuff; what does it mean for investors? Well, 2023 was a good year to examine. During Enterprise's fourth-quarter 2023 earnings conference call, management noted that natural gas prices were lower by nearly 60% in 2023. Oil prices fell almost 20%. Propane dropped by 36%. And ethane declined a huge 50% or so. These are all products that Enterprise moves through its midstream business."", ""Let's focus on oil and natural gas, which are Devon Energy's products. Devon has adopted a variable dividend policy so that higher energy prices lead to dividend increases, and lower prices lead to dividend cuts. In 2023, Devon paid a first-quarter dividend of $0.89 per share, followed by $0.72 in the second, $0.49 in the third, and it capped the year off with a $0.77 quarterly dividend. That's a lot of variability, but it makes logical sense, given the dividend policy and the inherent volatility of oil and natural gas prices."", ""Enterprise's distribution in the first two quarters of 2023 was $0.49 per unit, which was increased to $0.50 per unit in the final two quarters of the year. In other words, despite what was a difficult year for energy prices generally, highlighted by the variability in Devon's dividend, Enterprise's distribution didn't skip a beat. But the story gets even better: The consistent cash flow Enterprise generates from its toll-taker business model was supported by 13 operating records in 2023 (in other words, it handled record levels of product moving through its system). Basically, despite weak prices, demand for the MLP's infrastructure was robust."", ""To be fair, Enterprise's earnings were basically flat year over year, but that's still pretty impressive, given the variability in energy prices. For conservative dividend investors, such consistent performance can help make sleeping at night a lot easier, particularly if you are trying to live off of the income your portfolio generates."", ""There are plenty of dividend choices in the energy patch, including ExxonMobil\xa0and Chevron, which have both increased dividends annually for decades. However, the earnings swings at these two energy giants can be huge. Enterprise's results are a lot smoother, which is a function of both its midstream focus and management's business approach. Add in a steadily growing distribution, and Enterprise seems like the better choice for investors looking for a reliable and high-yield energy investment. In other words, consider adding Enterprise and its lofty 6.8% distribution yield to your portfolio today."", 'Should you invest $1,000 in Enterprise Products Partners right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Enterprise Products Partners, consider this:', 'The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\xa010 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Enterprise Products Partners wasn’t one of them.

Despite such predictions, the market continues to exhibit robust performance and resilience. The S&P 500 closed out the first quarter of the year with an over 10% gain. BlackRock, Inc.’s (NYSE:BLK) Managing Director, Tony DeSpirito, believes that a pullback won’t be surprising but keeps a bullish view on the rest of the year. He adds that stocks are set to outperform bonds and cash again this year while advising investors some caution with their equity choices. He believes that “the opportunity set for stock picking is the most robust” he has seen in 20 years. Tony DeSpirito’s firm sees some secular trends in the market that provide a bullish view on the broader market for the next three to five years. BlackRock, Inc.’s (NYSE:BLK) Q2 2024 equity market outlook suggests long-term opportunities in artificial intelligence, clean energy (including utilities and EVs), and the healthcare industries.', 'Principal Asset Management’s CIO, George Marris, also sees signs of a healthy future in the markets. In a CNBC interview on April 3, he said that while the recent performance of the stock market was credited to a few stocks, he expects a broadening in the market and favors cyclically exposed stocks. Marris forecasts opportunities in industrials, commodities, and UK-listed companies, along with the Chinese and Japanese markets. Among the foreign companies, George Marris believes that there are several UK-based multinational companies that have a geographic footprint similar to the ones in the US and are trading at cheap multiples. He added that in Japan, his firm sees a significant level of corporate reform due to “societal pressure and domestic activism”.', 'The Oracle of Omaha, Warren Buffett, is also showing confidence in the Japanese market, and his firm is upbeat about five specific stocks. The stocks include ITOCHU Corporation (8001.T), Mitsubishi Corporation (8058.T), Sumitomo Corporation (8053.T), Mitsui & Co., Ltd. (8031.T), and Marubeni Corporation (8002.T). In Berkshire Hathaway’s 2023 annual letter to shareholders, Buffett revealed that the firm increased its stake in all five of these companies in 2023 and owns about 9% of each. He wrote:', '“In certain important ways, all five companies – Itochu, Marubeni, Mitsubishi, Mitsui and Sumitomo – follow shareholder-friendly policies that are much superior to those customarily practiced in the U.S. Since we began our Japanese purchases, each of the five has reduced the number of its outstanding shares at attractive prices.', 'Meanwhile, the managements of all five companies have been far less aggressive about their own compensation than is typical in the United States. Note as well that each of the five is applying only about 1⁄3 of its earnings to dividends. The large sums the five retain are used both to build their many businesses and, to a lesser degree, to repurchase shares. Like Berkshire, the five companies are reluctant to issue shares.\xa0', 'An additional benefit for Berkshire is the possibility that our investment may lead to opportunities for us to partner around the world with five large, well-managed and well-respected companies. Their interests are far more broad than ours. And, on their side, the Japanese CEOs have the comfort of knowing that Berkshire will always possess huge liquid resources that can be instantly available for such partnerships, whatever their size may be.”', 'While navigating China’s economy, we reported that the position of the Chinese market holds significant importance to the global market as it is responsible for 10% of the world stock market capitalization and trade, 18% of the world GDP, and 16% of global oil demand.

(DAL) reversed course in the third quarter, falling 24% from its highs in July. The airlines in general were hurt from rising commodity prices that are leading to increased cost per available seat mile (CASM). Historically, airlines have passed on higher fuel prices to customers with a lag. We see Delta as a premium global consumer brand that is materially misunderstood by the market. The market still sees airlines as a cyclical, bankruptcy prone industry. An improved supply-demand picture, management discipline and a better business mix make Delta a more resilient business. Their loyalty program with American Express is a source of stable and growing revenues with $6.5B in remunerations this year with a goal of reaching $10B by the end of the contract in 2028. Premium and ancillary service revenue should generate 65-70% of the total in the next year or two. The company should continue to generate consistent mid-teens returns on capital. As the market begins to understand, we believe the company will continue to be rewarded. On top of this, free cash flow is expected to expand generating a cumulative ~$11B from ’23-’25, or one-half of its current market cap.

GE consistently sold their AER shares, creating heavy selling pressure. In addition, Aercaps planes on lease to Russian airlines were written off in 2022. Thus far, they received $1.2B in insurance recoverables, and ~$2B remains outstanding. Insurance proceeds provide substantial ammunition to aggressively repurchase shares. Ongoing engine and airplane production issues created a “hard market” for secondary transactions. Aercap continually sells planes and engines for over 1.2x carrying value, using proceeds to repurchase stock at or below book value. Note- at a couple of turns of leverage, this ROE is closer to 70%-80%. Repurchasing stock trading at 90% of BV is almost a 100% delta between private market transactions and the stock.

While it’s exciting to invest in growth companies and startups in the hopes that they will deliver significant returns in the long run, this approach also exposes you to significant risk. This has led to this list of stocks for endless income.', 'That’s why it’s crucial to keep a portion of your portfolio in income stocks. These stocks add ballast during market downturns, as cash-rich companies are usually mature and have resilient businesses. Moreover, if they have dividends, they can help out with extra cash during bad times – a lifeline when the markets are tumultuous.', 'So let’s look at seven stocks for endless income.', 'InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips', 'Source: tokar / Shutterstock', 'Stag Industrial (NYSE:STAG) is a REIT executing well thanks to strong tailwinds in the industrial property market. While the U.S. offshored operations for years, rapid reshoring is now occurring as companies onshore activities. Many overlook this trend since industrial falls under the struggling commercial real estate umbrella. But industrial looks to be the bright light, and STAG offers an excellent way to capitalize.', 'STAG’s Q4 results showcase the momentum, with revenue up 7.6% year-over-year to $183 million and net income surging 40% to nearly $42 million. Margins also expanded impressively. Looking ahead, I expect this growth trajectory to continue. Estimates call for FFO, a key REIT metric, to reach $2.63 per share by 2026 from $2.39 in 2024. Revenue is projected to jump 6.8% this year to $756 million and another 8.2% in 2025. It’s one of those stocks for endless income.', 'Given STAG’s history of exceeding expectations, including the 2.2% Q4 beat, these targets could prove conservative. The stock also provides an attractive 3.9% dividend yield. All in all, STAG appears set to keep rewarding investors as industrial demand flourishes.', 'Source: jittawit21/Shutterstock.com', 'Equinix (NASDAQ:EQIX) is an under-the-radar income stocks play on the exploding data and computing sectors. As a digital infrastructure REIT specializing in data centers and connectivity, EQIX benefits from the surging demand driven by AI startups and the continued digital shift. We’ve seen stocks like Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) skyrocket from these trends, but EQIX offers a more diversified route to capitalize.', 'Some investors grew concerned after the recent short report from Hindenburg Research accusing EQIX of hyping up its AI usage and misclassifying some expenses. However, EQIX mentioning AI is no different than countless other companies across sectors – it’s not just hype but a real demand catalyst. The stock’s resilience since the report is telling.', 'Also, every company right now is screaming “AI” at the top of their lungs. You could go look up companies completely unrelated to AI – like agriculture, and you’d still find their management boasting about how their company uses artificial intelligence. Equinix deserves the benefit of the doubt. This makes it one of those stocks for endless income.', 'In Q4, EQIX posted a blowout 15% revenue growth to nearly $2 billion, while net income rocketed 77% to $228 million. The 2.1% dividend yield provides a nice kicker, but the real narrative is cash flow. EQIX has grown FCF at a monster 147% pace over three years, beating 98% of peers!', 'Source: Dmitry Lobanov/Shutterstock.com', 'CBRE Group (NYSE:CBRE) isn’t churning out dividends, but it is doing a fair amount of buybacks and could have a lot of cash flowing in. The resilience here impresses me the most. In Q4 2023, revenue nearly reached $9 billion, beating expectations by 6%. That’s remarkable given the commercial real estate sector’s challenges.', 'Of course, dividends are only as strong as the cash flows funding them. Unfortunately, CBRE generated a only $18 million in free cash flow for 2023, that hasn’t provided ample coverage for those juicy payouts. However, what makes me bullish is that management is guiding for $1 billion in cash flow this year. This should allow it to buy back even more stock or initiate a decent dividend. That would lift up the stock and provide income. I expect this cash flow to rebound and grow beyond $1 billion in the coming years once commercial real estate recovers. This makes it one of those stocks for endless income.', 'Source: shutterstock.com/Lemonsoup14', 'Innovative Industrial Properties (NYSE:IIPR) specializes in leasing facilities to medical cannabis operators, and it pays to play in this niche. Boasting a mouth-watering 7% dividend yield, IIPR is a joint income investors won’t want to pass up.', 'But there’s more to this high-flying REIT than just its hefty payout. IIPR delivered solid results in Q4 2023, with revenue soaring 12% year-over-year to $79 million. Funds from operations (FFO), a key REIT metric, also impressed at $2.3 per share, easily covering the dividend.', 'The balance sheet is healthy over $140 million in cash $302 million in debt. Rate cuts should make the debt matter a lot less in the coming quarters. Thus, this REIT has ample flexibility to expand its portfolio and keep rewarding shareholders. I believe it is one of the best income stocks as it also has significant upside potential.', 'Source: Golden Dayz / Shutterstock.com', 'Storage is trending, and few execute better than Public Storage (NYSE:PSA). This self-storage REIT boasts an impressive track record of consistent cash distribution to shareholders. With a 4.15% dividend yield, it’s a reliable income choice.', '2023 core FFO per share grew 8.3% year-over-year. Same-store cost operations increased 5.1% as square foot occupancy remained strong at 92.7% despite a small decline.', 'What I find particularly compelling about PSA is its scale. With thousands of locations across the U.S., this REIT enjoys significant market share. This provides the company with an edge in acquiring properties and achieving economies of scale. Plus, with over $370 million in cash, PSA has ample capital to fund growth and sustain dividends. All things considered, it’s a self-storage stalwart income investors can rely on.', 'Source: Thapana_Studio / Shutterstock.com', 'Every portfolio needs a dash of regulated power, and income stocks like Public Service Enterprise Group (NYSE:PEG) could provide the perfect spark to ignite your income streams. This utility holding company has hiked dividends for over 13 years consecutively. With a current 3.4% yield, it offers dependable payouts.', 'The company has invested heavily in clean energy and modernizing infrastructure. These investments are expected to pay off, with EPS growth expected to be well above 5% annually in the coming years.', 'I’m particularly bullish due to PEG filing its first rate case in nearly 6 years. If approved, it could meaningfully boost earnings and support future dividend hikes. The case includes mechanisms to reduce customer bill volatility, a wise move given inflation. With robust investment and a supportive New Jersey regulatory environment, PEG seems set to sustain those dividends for years. It’s a utility name high on my income watchlist.', 'Source: C H A L N / Shutterstock.com', 'This wireless maverick may not be known as one of the income stocks for fat yields, with a modest 1.6% yield currently. But sometimes headline dividend numbers don’t tell the whole story.', 'T-Mobile (NASDAQ:TMUS) has been crushing it in terms of customer growth and profitability. In Q4 2023, the company added a staggering 3.1 million postpaid net additions.', 'So why am I bullish on TMUS as an income play despite the low yield? Because I believe the company’s robust growth and cash generation will lead to much larger payouts eventually. With Sprint integration costs fading and massive 5G leadership, T-Mobile has huge potential to grow dividends over time. It’s a bet on what the un-carrier could transform into as a cash cow. It’s also one of those stocks for endless income.', 'On the date of publication, Omor Ibne Ehsan did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

The\xa0PHLX Semiconductor Sector index gained an impressive 51% during this period thanks to the booming chip demand triggered by the growing adoption of artificial intelligence (AI) applications.', ""Semiconductors play a central role in the AI revolution. The training of AI models such as OpenAI's ChatGPT was made possible using chips designed by the likes of Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA). This explains why Nvidia's AI-focused graphics processing units (GPUs) have been selling like hotcakes over the past 18 months, leading to a sharp jump in Nvidia's revenue and earnings."", ""The market rewarded Nvidia handsomely for its stellar growth. That's evident from the 225% jump in the company's stock price in the past year. It won't be surprising to see Nvidia maintain its outstanding momentum as well thanks to expectations of strong top- and bottom-line growth. However, Nvidia is not the only company in the hardware supply chain driving the AI revolution."", ""Here's a closer look at five other names playing a central role in the AI hardware market."", ""While the likes of Nvidia, Intel, and Advanced Micro Devices make or design chips that are used for addressing AI workloads such as training large language models (LLMs) and for inferencing purposes, those chips need to be mounted on a server infrastructure that's specifically designed for running AI workloads. Dell Technologies (NYSE: DELL) and Super Micro Computer (NASDAQ: SMCI) are two names benefiting big-time from the growing need for AI-optimized servers."", ""While shares of Dell have jumped 184% in the past year, Supermicro stock has rocketed higher, with eye-popping gains of 847%. Despite these massive jumps, both stocks still trade at attractive multiples. Dell has a sales multiple of just 0.9, while Supermicro's reading stands at 5.6. Their sales multiples are lower than the Nasdaq-100 Technology Sector index's average price-to-sales ratio of 7.3."", 'A closer look at how AI drives their growth will demonstrate why investors bought their stocks hand over fist in the past year. It also explains why they are still worth buying. Dell, for instance, is set to return to growth in the current fiscal year after struggling in the previous one because of weak personal computer (PC) sales.', 'Its top line fell 14% in fiscal 2024 (which ended on Feb. 2, 2024) to $88.4 billion. Dell has guided for $93 billion in revenue in the current year at the midpoint of its guidance range, and the demand for AI servers is one of the reasons behind its turnaround. Dell shipped $800 million worth of AI-optimized servers last quarter. Even better, its AI server backlog almost doubled quarter over quarter to $2.9 billion thanks to a 40% sequential increase in AI server orders.', ""The good part is that Dell's AI server order book could keep getting fatter. The AI server market is set to grow from an estimated $30 billion last year to $150 billion in 2027, according to Foxconn. This is precisely the reason why even Super Micro Computer stock has turned out to be a stock market favorite in the past year."", ""Supermicro's growth has been stunning with its revenue in the ongoing fiscal year 2024 set to double to $14.5 billion from $7.1 billion in fiscal 2023. More importantly, the server manufacturer claims that its production capacity is solid enough to support more than $25 billion in annual revenue. This explains why analysts have significantly raised their revenue estimates for the next couple of years. However, it won't be surprising to see the company crushing those expectations thanks to its capacity expansion moves."", 'Memory chips from the likes of Micron Technology (NASDAQ: MU) are helping Nvidia manufacture powerful AI GPUs. This explains why Micron sold out its entire 2024 capacity of high-bandwidth memory (HBM) chips that are deployed in AI chips, while also allocating an ""overwhelming majority"" of its HBM production line for next year.', ""HBM is deployed to increase the speed at which data is fed to AI processors, significantly boosting the performance of AI processors. This explains why Nvidia and AMD have been packing more HBM into their AI chips, driving impressive growth for Micron. The memory specialist's revenue was up 58% year over year last quarter to $5.8 billion. It is expecting stronger growth of 76% in revenue in the current quarter to $6.6 billion from $3.75 billion in the year-ago quarter."", 'Analysts expect Micron to finish the year with a 57% spike in revenue to $24.3 billion followed by another impressive year in fiscal 2025 with an estimated revenue jump of 42%. With shares of Micron currently trading at 6.4 times sales despite rising 95% in the past year, buying it looks like a smart thing to do as the HBM market could generate $49 billion in annual revenue in 2030 as compared to $857 million last year.', 'Another chipmaker benefiting from the AI chip market is Broadcom (NASDAQ: AVGO), a stock that has jumped 106% in the past year. In February, J.P. Morgan analyst Harlan Sur pointed out that Broadcom is set to become the second-largest AI chip company in 2024 with an estimated revenue of $8 billion to $9 billion thanks to customers such as Alphabet and Meta Platforms for whom it makes custom AI chips.', ""But when Broadcom released its fiscal 2024 first-quarter results, management said that its AI chip revenue is set to exceed $10 billion in the current fiscal year. However, don't be surprised to see Broadcom exceeding that mark as it recently added a new customer for its custom AI chips. Wall Street analysts believe that the newly added customer could be Amazon, Apple, or TikTok parent ByteDance."", ""It is easy to see why Broadcom's AI customer pipeline is increasing. Cloud companies are looking to develop custom chips for running AI workloads to reduce costs, consume less power, and improve performance. This explains why Morgan Stanley predicts custom chips will account for 30% of the $182 billion AI semiconductor market in 2027, indicating that Broadcom's addressable market in AI chips could be worth almost $55 billion in three years."", ""So, Broadcom's AI business could keep growing at a nice clip moving forward, which is why buying the stock now could be a good idea as it is trading at 28 times forward earnings, in line with the Nasdaq-100's forward earnings multiple and lower than Nvidia's reading of 36."", 'All the above-mentioned names supply AI hardware, but it eventually comes down to electronics manufacturing services providers such as Jabil (NYSE: JBL) to make the end products. This stock is trading up 52% in the past year but recently took a big hit. Savvy investors, however, would do well to take a look at the bigger picture.', 'From designing and sourcing components to assembling the final product, Jabil products and services are deployed to reduce costs and enhance efficiency. Not surprisingly, Jabil saw a big surge in AI-related orders. Management pointed out on its recent earnings conference call that its ""AI GPU volume in the first half of 2024 is 200x that of the level of 2023.""', ""Even better, Jabil points out that its AI-related revenue is set to increase by 20% in fiscal 2025 to $6 billion. That would be 20% of the company's top line based on the consensus estimate of $30 billion in revenue for fiscal 2025."", 'Jabil\'s AI business could keep growing in the future as the company claims that it is ""winning share across multiple end markets in the AI data center infrastructure space."" That\'s why investors would do well to take a closer look at this AI stock that\'s trading at just 0.5 times sales and 21 times trailing earnings before it steps on the gas.', 'Should you invest $1,000 in Super Micro Computer right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Super Micro Computer, consider this:', 'The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\xa010 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Super Micro Computer wasn’t one of them.

And it raises questions about how UPS (NYSE: UPS) can make a decent profit flying mail if rival FedEx was struggling to do so.', 'But experts said the change meets the needs of the three organizations, each of which is undergoing substantial transformation in a shifting parcel environment. For FedEx Express, losing the postal business means it now has the freedom to aggressively move ahead with shrinking its large air network in conjunction with a huge corporate initiative to control costs.', 'The new agreement has a minimum base term of five and a half years, under which UPS will transport first-class mail, Priority Mail and Priority Express Mail.', '“It’s a win-win-win,” Satish Jindel, president of parcel shipping consultancy ShipMatrix, told FreightWaves.', 'The long-standing relationship between FedEx and the U.S. Postal Service was widely expected to change. The only question was whether FedEx would relinquish some, or all, of the air cargo business.', 'It was difficult for the express carrier to eke out a profit as the Postal Service in recent years shifted volume from air to ground transportation to improve truck utilization and reduce expenses as demand for next-day service decreased. The quasigovernmental agency implemented new delivery standards to help with that transition. It now promises Priority Mail service in one to three days instead of two and has extended delivery windows for Ground Advantage packages. The latest goal is to cut overall transportation costs by $3 billion over the next two years.', 'A large portion of FedEx Express’ air network is geared to daytime flying for the Postal Service. The company had to absorb more per-unit operating costs as the traditional postal subsidy for its fixed infrastructure slowly evaporated. FedEx’s payments from the Postal Service dropped to $1.6 billion in the fiscal year that ended Sept. 30, 2023, from $1.9 billion, said David Hendel, a transportation attorney at Culhane Meadows who tracks the Postal Service’s top suppliers. His report last year showed FedEx’s revenue from the Postal Service was more than $2.1 billion in fiscal year 2021.', 'Company executives repeatedly made clear that they were willing to walk away from the postal business unless it included more favorable terms and a smaller route structure.', 'Jindel said losing the postal contract is a blessing in disguise for FedEx, which is undergoing a watershed consolidation of its FedEx Express, Ground and Freight units into a single network — something management gave a lot of thought to before proceeding and projects will provide $4 billion in annual efficiency gains.', '“It probably makes sense for them not to be aggressive in trying to retain that business, and focus on getting the integration right. And then, when that opportunity comes up again, they may be in a more cost-effective position to bid on it,” said Jindel, a founding member of small-package carrier RPS that FedEx acquired in 1998 and renamed FedEx Ground.', 'FedEx’s campaign to take out $4 billion in structural costs by the end of fiscal year 2025 already includes accelerating the retirement of aging aircraft, parking underutilized aircraft until demand picks up and relying more on truck feeder services. The company is also redesigning the air network to move express and deferred shipments in segregated overnight and daytime blocks to improve efficiency.', 'Barclays transportation analyst Brandon Oglenski said in a research note that FedEx is likely to remove significant capacity from its air network next year when it no longer needs infrastructure to support the Postal Service, which will help boost the Express unit’s profit margins.', 'Freight experts said FedEx will be able to cut daytime flying and consolidate routes.', '“With the U.S. Postal Service now out of the picture, and volume decreasing, FedEx will probably look to consolidate aircraft operations in small-to-medium-sized markets within close proximity, to drive savings,” said Dean Maciuba, managing partner at Crossroads Parcel Consulting and a longtime FedEx executive. “However, this type of operational change could also drive earlier pickup and later delivery times in the market that loses its aircraft.”', 'The risk is that shippers, which prefer the latest pickup and earliest delivery times possible, could seek out other carriers.', 'Anthony DeRuijter, an analyst at global research firm Third Bridge, said FedEx could collapse routes for Great Falls and Billings, Montana, for example, “and take out redundant flight hours.”', 'Another way FedEx can reduce costs, Maciuba explained, is by outsourcing ground support services at smaller air stations that are currently held by more expensive employees or shrinking teams by combining duties since there will be fewer flights.', 'Savings will be less if management redeploys aircraft under the new “Tricolor” initiative to go after more deferred freight, Oglenski said. FedEx has said it plans to use international and domestic daytime flights to handle shipments common to the less-than-truckload sector, which it distinguishes from low-yielding general cargo typically handled by freight forwarders.', 'Pilots will be one of the primary losers as FedEx shrinks its airline. A FedEx executive said in a private meeting late last year, reported by FreightWaves, that up to 300 pilots would no longer be needed if postal flying were substantially reduced. The number of surplus pilots is likely higher than that with the contract’s complete termination now confirmed.', 'On the other side of the ledger, UPS gets a contract with a five-and-a-half-year minimum base term that adds about $1.5 billion to its top line and volume to increase density on its trunk routes in a market with slow growth opportunity.', 'Some investment analysts expressed concern that UPS’ returns from the Postal Service business will be marginal and won’t help achieve the target 13% operating margin by 2026.', 'Jindel said that won’t be a problem because UPS is laser-focused on costs and will save money by using its ground network to support the air cargo contract — something FedEx wasn’t able to do because its air and ground networks were siloed.', '“UPS has been running an integrated air and ground network for over 25 to 30 years. I don’t see them having to add any extra airplanes. So it helps them offset that fixed cost and spread that over another base of packages,” he said.', 'Oglenski agreed, saying UPS likely offered the Postal Service cheaper linehaul transportation services “by relying less on air capacity, especially between market locations that can be reached with one to two day trucking solutions.” UPS might need to deploy some incremental air assets in the daytime air network because its fleet is much smaller than FedEx’s, he added, but any extra costs are probably covered through the new contract.', 'Plus, the postal volumes help backfill Second-Day Air volumes UPS has lost in recent years as the retailer does more two-day delivery with its own logistics network, noted Derek Lossing, a former Amazon logistics executive who runs consulting firm Cirrus Global Advisors, on LinkedIn. UPS said average daily package volume fell 7.4% in the fourth quarter, with the deferred air product falling faster (18.9%) than next-day air or ground.', 'UPS also had an advantage in its negotiations with the Postal Service, Jindel said. For years, FedEx and UPS have offered retailers products that balance speed and price by injecting packages in the postal network for final-mile delivery. FedEx over time shifted that last-mile delivery traffic in-house to FedEx Ground drivers, while UPS still gives 60% of SurePost packages to the post office. And UPS Mail Innovations gives nearly 100% of its lightweight parcels and bulk mail, such as annual reports, to the Postal Service for the last mile.', '“You would have to expect that the post office would look more favorably to them for the air service,” Jindel said.', 'Click here for more FreightWaves stories by Eric Kulisch.', 'Sign up for the weekly American Shipper Air newsletter here.\xa0', 'UPS to close 200 sort centers in modernization push', 'FedEx deactivates 17 more aircraft as cost controls pay off', 'The post Postal Service’s air cargo shift to UPS makes everyone a winner\xa0 appeared first on FreightWaves.']"

Investors are aiming to maximize their investments, and if someone else turned their money into billions, it's a good sign that they may know what they're doing."", ""You can mirror a billionaire's movements to a certain degree. Only their holding company's or hedge fund's positions are public, if that's how they got their billions, not their personal filings. These positions are only reported on a quarterly basis, so you won't know exactly when they're buying or selling. And they likely have different investing goals than yours, especially if they're trading other people's money."", ""That doesn't mean you can't get inspiration from a billionaire's portfolio.

Management reiterated that it expected Disney+ to be profitable by the end of fiscal 2024.', ""Investors were getting worried when Disney+ expenses were skyrocketing and subscriptions were slowing down, and the overall vision for the company looked unclear.

If you want to learn more about discounted cash flow, the rationale behind this calculation can be read in detail in the Simply Wall St analysis model."", ' View our latest analysis for Mondelez International ', ""We use what is known as a 2-stage model, which simply means we have two different periods of growth rates for the company's cash flows. Generally the first stage is higher growth, and the second stage is a lower growth phase. To begin with, we have to get estimates of the next ten years of cash flows. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years."", ""Generally we assume that a dollar today is more valuable than a dollar in the future, so we discount the value of these future cash flows to their estimated value in today's dollars:"", '2024', '2025', '2026', '2027', '2028', '2029', '2030', '2031', '2032', '2033', ' Levered FCF ($, Millions) ', 'US$4.23b', 'US$4.93b', 'US$5.29b', 'US$5.81b', 'US$6.18b', 'US$6.47b', 'US$6.73b', 'US$6.96b', 'US$7.17b', 'US$7.38b', 'Growth Rate Estimate Source', 'Analyst x10', 'Analyst x10', 'Analyst x8', 'Analyst x3', 'Analyst x3', 'Est @ 4.67%', 'Est @ 3.96%', 'Est @ 3.46%', 'Est @ 3.11%', 'Est @ 2.86%', ' Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 6.0% ', 'US$4.0k', 'US$4.4k', 'US$4.4k', 'US$4.6k', 'US$4.6k', 'US$4.6k', 'US$4.5k', 'US$4.4k', 'US$4.3k', 'US$4.1k', '(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$44b', ""We now need to calculate the Terminal Value, which accounts for all the future cash flows after this ten year period.

You don't have to agree with these inputs, I recommend redoing the calculations yourself and playing with them. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Mondelez International as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 6.0%, which is based on a levered beta of 0.800. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole.

But that doesn't mean it's a bad idea. He isn't called the Oracle of Omaha for nothing, after all."", ""With that in mind, here are three stocks held in the portfolio of Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway\xa0that might be good additions to yours."", 'In theory, this is a tough time to be in the banking business. The economy feels lethargic and interest rates are high, which tends to crimp demand for most banking services. Defaults and delinquencies on loans are on the rise. Investment banking activity for mergers and acquisitions and initial public offerings also is tepid. And yet Bank of America (NYSE: BAC) shares are up by nearly 50% from their October low, and just reached a new 52-week high. What gives?', ""To understand this stock's strong performance during the past five months, you have to start by going back a little more than two years. That's when investors began pricing in a worst-case economic scenario -- and then some -- that never actually ended up materializing. The market is simply correcting its mistake now."", ""The thing is, there's still plenty more upside left to tap. BofA shares are priced inexpensively at less than 13 times this year's projected earnings per share (EPS) of $2.91. And, with the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development forecasting global gross domestic product (GDP) growth of 2.9% in 2024 and the International Monetary Fund expecting 3.1% (and with both of them predicting that growth will accelerate in 2025), analysts believe Bank of America's EPS will reach $3.18 next year."", 'In other words, BofA stock is undervalued because its prospects are largely being underestimated.', ""That's not an unusual dynamic within the predictably cyclical banking business, of course; buying quality bank stocks during these lulls has historically proven rewarding."", ""Buffett, of course, knows all of this. That's not the only reason he's sticking with the Bank of America position Berkshire's been holding since 2017, though -- a position that's now the conglomerate's second-biggest stock holding, worth a whopping $38 billion. Buffett is also loving the reliable dividend payment Berkshire is collecting. New buyers of the stock will be plugging into BofA while its dividend yield is a healthy 2.6%."", ""It doesn't occupy nearly as large a place in the Berkshire Hathaway portfolio as Bank of America does, but BYD (OTC: BYDD.F) is an interesting Buffett pick all the same -- and increasingly so."", ""Never heard of it? Perhaps you have without even realizing it. This Chinese company is now the world's biggest manufacturer of electric vehicles (EVs). Whereas Tesla shipped about 484,500 EVs in the final quarter of 2023 -- a figure that slumped to 422,875 million in Q1 -- BYD delivered 525,409 battery-powered cars during the last quarter of last year. This number dropped in Q1, but between BYD's all-electric vehicles and its plug-in hybrids, the Chinese automaker actually shipped a whopping 624,398 units in the period."", ""These aren't dinky EVs either. BYD's lineup consists of full-sized sedans and reasonably sized SUVs, all of which are priced competitively with comparable Tesla models."", ""If you don't recall ever seeing one of these vehicles on the road, that's natural. BYD's vehicles aren't sold in the U.S., and they probably won't be anytime soon."", ""It doesn't matter. Given U.S. consumers' relative lack of enthusiasm for electric vehicles at the moment, BYD is rightfully focusing its attention everywhere else where demand for battery-powered and plug-in hybrid automobiles is much healthier. S&P Global believes worldwide purchases of battery-powered vehicles will rise 34% to 13.3 million units this year. China and Europe are expected to continue leading this growth. Analysts with GlobalX ETFs predict that the worldwide electric vehicle market could be five times bigger by 2035 than it is now. No wonder Buffett likes BYD's business."", ""That said, there's a specific reason BYD stock is a strong buy specifically this month. That's because of its slight pullback from last month's high, and the fact that shares are down 40% from 2022's peak."", 'Given the industrywide tailwinds for EVs, gains for BYD should be in the cards sooner or later, and likely sooner than later.', 'Last but not least, add energy producer\xa0Occidental Petroleum (NYSE: OXY) to your list of Buffett stocks to buy in April.', ""The company isn't his typical cup of tea. Although he's owned oil and natural gas stocks in the past and is also sitting on a sizable stake in Chevron, it's a seemingly beleaguered segment that hasn't been a key component of Berkshire's holdings for several years."", ""So why are Occidental and Chevron now the fund's fifth- and sixth-biggest stock positions? For a couple of reasons."", ""The first is simply that it's becoming clear that alternative energy sources are still decades away from being the planet's primary sources of power generation. The U.S. Energy Information Administration says renewables won't eclipse petroleum as the world's top sources of power production until the late 2040s, and even then, natural gas and oil combined will still meet about half of the world's energy needs. Indeed, we'll actually be consuming more natural gas and crude oil at that point in time than we do now."", ""The second reason Berkshire's sitting on $17 billion worth of Occidental Petroleum shares is a related one, and company-specific. Occidental is arguably doing more than any other energy major to ensure it's ready to meet these near-term and future needs."", 'And the situation is dire, to be sure. As Occidental Chief Executive Officer Vicki Hollub explained at the World Economic Forum in January, ""In the near term, the markets are not balanced; supply, demand is not balanced... 2025 and beyond is when the world is going to be short of oil."" Underscoring this dynamic are numbers from Rystad Energy. The firm notes that as the exploration industry stands right now, only one barrel\'s worth of new crude is being found for every six barrels consumed.', 'Given that oil prices are apt to remain high indefinitely, Occidental Petroleum is poised to remain a cash-generating machine for just as long.', 'Should you invest $1,000 in Bank of America right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Bank of America, consider this:', 'The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\xa010 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Bank of America wasn’t one of them.

(NYSE:MA) has proven to be one of the best growth compounding stocks over the years. With the company set to enter the Chinese domestic market, it looks poised to continue to perform well.', ""Mastercard is one of the world's largest global payment networks, where it authorizes, clears and settles transactions made through credit, debit and prepaid cards, as well as digital payments. It can also handle automated clearing house transactions. Its brands include Mastercard, Maestro and Cirrus."", 'Warning! GuruFocus has detected 7 Warning Sign with MA.', 'The company earns money by collecting a percentage of the gross dollar value on its branded cards that run through its payment network. It also earning fees from value-added services it provides.', ""Mastercard is the third-largest credit card processor in world, behind Visa (NYSE:V) and China's UnionPay, and the second largest in the U.S. Together Visa, UnionPay and Mastercard handle nearly 97% of all global transactions."", 'Being part of a triopoly, and a duopoly in many places in the world, Mastercard is in an envious position. While it can gain or lose market share, in general it benefits from the natural rise of global consumer spending. It also benefits from the secular shift away from cash toward electronic payments, especially in emerging markets, as well as increased cross-border spending.', 'Meanwhile, the company has had an edge over larger rival Visa in Europe. Mastercard has taken share across the pond as Visa has had to modernize its European network after buying it in 2016. The company has been able to secure portfolios from large European banks over the last few years, and has greatly closed the gap between the two companies in Europe.', 'Looking ahead, China is an opportunity for the company as well. Mastercard recently had a joint venture in the country receive approval for domestic bank card clearing. It has operated in the country on the cross-border side of the business and will now look to make inroads with Chinese banks and credit card issuers. Earlier this year, the company also began to enable inbound acceptance from Tencent and Alipay wallets. This is important because China is largely a digital payment society and it allows international travelers to pay at QR code payment points like locals.', ""I would not expect Mastercard to gain a lot of market share in China, but given how massive the Chinese economy is, even capturing a small percentage could be meaningful. China's gross domestic product is over $18 trillion, with over half of that from consumer consumption. Capturing just a 1% market share with a 1.50% swipe fee would be about a $1.30 billion opportunity."", 'The company has also been very good at growing its value-added services business, which included things such as fraud protection, identity verification and data analytics. In the fourth quarter, value-added services was its fastest-growing segment, with revenue rising 19%, or 17% in constant currencies, to $2.66 billion, outpacing the 9% growth, or 7% in constant currencies, to $3.89 billion of its payment network.', 'Looking to continue to grow the value-added service side of its business, Mastercard is investing in generative artificial intelligence to help in the areas of personalized real-time assistance and data analytics. Among the products it is introducing are an AI-driven conversational shopping tool and a personalized AI assistant to business owners.', ""When it comes to risk, the global economy is front and center. Mastercard's growth comes from increasing consumption growth, so if that grows less than expected or falls, it would be a negative for the company. The company also said it is monitoring risks from credit availability and delinquency rates, which could cause credit card issuers to pullback issuing cards or consumers spending less."", 'There also could be some competitive risk with Capital One Financial (NYSE:COF) acquiring Discover Financial Services (NYSE:DFS), which runs a small payments network. Capital One is a Mastercard client, so it could potentially look to issue more cards from Discover and run it through its soon to be acquired payment network.', 'Asked about the deal at a recent Citi Fintech conference last month, Mastercard President of the Americas Linda Kirkpatrick said:', ""Our relationship with Capital One has been a strong and important one for many, many years, both in the context of their cards business as well as their services business. That is true before the announcement that remains true after the announcement. You've heard them say publicly, and we've talked to them right after they made their announcement and they value the relationship that they have with us as a network. They value our services and our international acceptance and our brand. And they don't anticipate that changing. So, I believe that for the long term, we will be partnering with Capital One across a variety of topics. But what I really believe is this is a very strong demonstration that competition within our markets is incredibly robust. Whether it's this announcement or the proliferation of alternative payment methods, buy now, pay later providers, digital wallets, digital currencies, account-to-account, real-time payments, competition has never been more robust, and that is clear. But with respect to Capital One, there's a lot that still remains to be decided and concluded. I am confident that we will work with them into the long run."", 'Clearly the company expects to remain a Capital One customer, but it also wants to give the illusion there is a lot of competition in the space. And the reason behind that can be seen on the regulation front.', 'Mastercard and Visa just settled a $30 billion anti-trust lawsuit with the U.S. government. In addition to the fine, the companies agreed to reduce swipe fees by at least 4 basis points over the next three years and to for them to average 7 basis points lower of the next five years. If Mastercard extended the swipe fee reductions globally, it looks like it would only be about an $11 million impact to yearly revenue.', 'Mastercard trades over 26 times the 2024 consensus adjusted Ebitda of $17.27 billion and 23 times the 2025 consensus of $19.76 billion.', 'The company is projected to grow its revenue 12% in 2024 and about 12.60% in 2025.', 'Mastercard trades at a premium to Visa, which stands at around 21.50 times 2024 Ebitda, while seeing just slightly less revenue growth at 10%.', 'Prior to the pandemic, Mastercard stock traded at an enterprise value/Ebitda multiple of between 17.50 and 30. Based on that range, a fair value for the stock based on 2025 Ebitda would be between $370 and $633.', 'Projecting 12% growth annual growth out the next 10 years, keeping its adjusted Ebitda margins and placing a 20 times multiple on the stock would give you a $1,020 stock. Discount that back using a 5% rate would give you a $626 present valuation on the stock.', 'Mastercard is a tremendous business that should see secular trends working in its favor for years to come. Meanwhile, it has an opportunity to bolster its business even more by getting into the domestic China card clearing business and through further innovations in valued-added services.', 'The company is a great growth compounder that consistently sees its revenue climb in the low to high teens during typical economic environments.

Loop Capital Markets Managing Director Anthony Chukumba told Yahoo Finance the announcement was ""a little surprising"" given that the beauty retailer released earnings just three weeks ago.', 'Chukumba recently downgraded Ulta\'s shares to Hold, given the stock\'s valuation. However, there are things that give the beauty retailer a leg up over rivals. Chukumba notes that Ulta carries both prestige and drugstore brands, giving it a diverse product mix. He also notes that some stores have spas and that, generally, their stores tend to be less intimidating than others. The most important advantage Ulta has is its loyalty program, Chukumba says, arguing it has ""the most compelling"" program.', 'Watch the video above to hear Chukumba explain why, for some customers, cosmetics are not a discretionary purchase.', 'Be sure to watch the full interview with Anthony Chukumba. For more expert insight and the latest market action, click here to watch this full episode of Market Domination', ""Editor's note: This article was written by Stephanie Mikulich."", ""JOSH LIPTON: And in this space, Anthony, I'm just curious, this name Ulta Beauty, what are their competitive advantages if you were to spell them out, Anthony?"", ""ANTHONY CHUKUMBA: Oh, absolutely, they've got a ton of competitive advantages. So you know, look, Ulta Beauty, one of their big advantages is that they have both prestige brands, so the higher-end brands, think like a Mac or a Drunk Elephant, but then they have also those kind of mass brands, like the type of stuff that you'd find, like L'Oreal, you know, in a drugstore. The most sort of beauty products retailers have one or the other, they don't have both."", ""Another thing is that they also have spas in their stores. And another thing is that their stores particularly relative to Sephora. I mean, they're just not as intimidating, quite frankly, for the shopper. But one of the most important competitive advantages from my perspective is their customer loyalty program, Ulta Beauty rewards, used to be called Ultimate Rewards."", ""We actually just had ironically had a report out today in which we compared customer loyalty programs for all of our companies, covered companies that have them, and we thought that Ulta Beauty had the most compelling one. And it also becomes very important because one thing we found, at least in terms of prestige beauty products, and we've done work on this for a long time, pricing is strictly at manufacturer's suggested retail prices. So in other words, the same price you're going to pay at Ulta is what you're going to pay at Neiman Marcus, at Nordstrom, at Macy's, at Sephora."", ""So it's sort of like, OK, if I'm going to pay the same price regardless of where I go, I'd rather go to somewhere where I can get both the prestige and the mass. That's-- you know, I can get my hair did if I decide I want to do that. And I get all these loyalty program points. And it's just a pretty customer-friendly environment."", ""JULIE HYMAN: Yeah. So it's-- as you say, it's confounding, I guess, that this is happening. I can't help but think of what we heard from PVH the other day. Obviously, very different category, right? We're talking about apparel and shoes, but they pointed out weakness in Europe. But that doesn't help solve this conundrum, because Ulta doesn't operate in Europe. So I guess, does this imply anything about what we're seeing among American shoppers?"", ""ANTHONY CHUKUMBA: It certainly might. And part of the reason that I think that is that-- you know, look, I think that a lot of investors think of beauty products as being discretionary, right? In other words, gas prices are higher, inflation is higher, maybe I'm worried about losing my job, I'll cut back. I mean, for that-- for Ulta's target customer, what they call the beauty enthusiast, these products are just not that discretionary, right?"", ""I mean, you know, she wakes up in the morning. She takes a shower. She puts her face on there's a whole sort of routine with a lot of different products involved. She gets done for the day. Maybe she's got a date. Once again, there's a whole routine. Before she even goes to bed, there's a whole routine, right? And I think it's the type of thing where you're just not going to disrupt that unless you absolutely positively have to."", ""And so from that perspective, yeah, maybe this should scare us. Look, I'm loathe to draw too much or to read too much into it. I mean, it's a very short period of time. I think we need to get more data before we make a larger call about the state of the US consumer.""]"

Regardless, Vertex appears to be in a solid position for at least the next decade.', 'Alternative possible future scenarios were considered in my analysis, in which investors could be more or less optimistic, which would give the stock different multiples. The starting point was free cash flow of $3.50 billion, which was the same in 2023 but lower than in 2022. The future growth rate was imputed as lower for years five to 10, assuming a saturated market, and ranged from 35% for the first years of the rosier scenario to 5% for the last years of the distressed one. A discounted cash flow analysis was then performed. Results were encouraging, with a potential for substantial price appreciation for the bullish scenario and not extreme overvaluation for the average one.', ""Further, the GF Value Line, which is based on historical ratios, past financial performance and analysts' future projections, indicates the stock is only modestly overvalued."", ""Investors may be nervous about the company's impressive past performance, with the stock advancing a compounded annual average of 20.20% for the last 10 years and 43.50% in the last year alone. This analysis has found Vertex has solid financials (high cash, low liabilities and impressive net margin) and a valid moat in the form of patent-protected intellectual property."", 'These parameters alone should only account for a part of the value attributed to Vertex Pharmaceuticals since the potential for its pipeline is tangible.

Per the terms of the deal, Lockheed will provide sustainment engineering and logistics services support for all types/models/series of H-60 helicopters.', 'The contract will serve the U.S. Navy, along with the governments of Australia, Denmark, Saudi Arabia, South Korea, Greece, India and Spain.

Unlike other, more common types of cancers where rates have either declined or remained flat due to advanced technologies in screening, the incidence of EAC hassignificantly increased over the past few decades.

Looking ahead to 2024, Masco anticipates further enhancement in its adjusted operating margin to 17%, with specific segments, such as Plumbing Products, expecting an impressive adjusted operating margin of 18.5% and the Decorative Architectural Products unit aiming for 18%. These outcomes underscore the significant benefits derived from Masco's stringent cost-control efforts.Focus on New Products: With its superior repair and remodel-focused products dominating multiple distribution channels, alongside its robust financial position and prudent capital management, Masco is well-positioned to consistently generate lasting value for its shareholders in the foreseeable future. In 2023, the company secured additional shelf space in adjacent product categories, launched new products and invested in the PRO paint business, portraying the strength of the Behr brand. The PRO paint business within the Decorative Architectural segment continues to gain a significant share of the market. Masco launched adjacent paint categories like aerosols, interior stains, and caulks and sealants within PRO that added to the results in 2023. The company plans to increase investment in people and capabilities in 2024.Solid Long-Term Goal: Despite facing challenges such as slowing housing demand and industry-wide issues, Masco remains optimistic about its long-term growth prospects. The company foresees robust growth, expecting to achieve an average annual organic sales growth of 3-5%. Additionally, acquisitions are projected to contribute 1-3% annually to sales.Masco is confident in its ability to deliver strong earnings growth, targeting an average annual EPS growth of around 10%. This growth will be supported by the expansion of operating margins through cost productivity improvements and leveraging volume. Furthermore, Masco aims to reach its long-term full-year margin targets, aiming for nearly 18.5% by 2026. Within this target, the Plumbing Products segment is expected to grow by approximately 20%, while the Decorative Architectural Products segment is anticipated to rise 19-20%.In addition to growth-oriented strategies, Masco is committed to delivering value to its shareholders. The company plans to return 1-2% above EPS growth to shareholders through dividends and 2-4% through share repurchases. These comprehensive plans underscore Masco's dedication to driving both growth and shareholder returns in the foreseeable future.Acquisitions: Masco's portfolio expansion through acquisitions persists with the recent acquisition of all share capital of Sauna360 Group Oy in the third quarter of 2023. Sauna360 offers a diverse product portfolio, including traditional, infrared, and wood-burning saunas, as well as steam showers. This acquisition has been integrated into Masco's Plumbing Products segment."", 'Some other top-ranked stocks that warrant a look in the sector are as follows:Advanced Drainage Systems, Inc.

Though there are still lower-cost AI stocks in the mega-cap universe, I’d argue that few are capable of the type of upside as some of the market’s most innovative biotechnology firms — like LLY, REGN, and BHVN.', 'Further, the biotechnology scene stands out as one of the industries that can also be made more efficient by the rise of AI technologies. Indeed, biotechnology investing can be rather speculative, given uncertainties involving clinical trials and how much “promise” is really in a firm’s development pipeline. Add a bit of the magic offered by AI tools, though, and I think the whole process of biotechnology innovation could be changed for the better.', 'In this piece, we’ll use TipRanks’ Comparison Tool to check out three fast-running biotechs that have what it takes to extend their gains many years into the future.', 'Eli Lilly’s parabolic surge has been many years in the making, with the name now up more than 116% in the past year alone on the back of weight-loss drug (GLP-1) hype. Though Ozempic and Wegovy may have received most of the praise, we can’t count out the growth prospects of Eli Lilly’s Mounjaro and Zepbound. Arguably, Eli Lilly’s offering may be perceived as better, given that it’s been more effective at lowering A1C (in other words, reducing average blood sugar levels) and producing larger drops in weight.', 'In any case, only time will tell which GLP-1 drug reigns supreme. For now, it’s hard not to be bullish on Eli Lilly as it looks to combat obesity with future innovations. And let’s not forget that GLP-1 drugs may have benefits beyond just weight loss. However, we’ll have to wait for how the clinical trials pan out.', 'Though I view Eli Lilly as the number-one GLP-1 stock, I’m a tad uncomfortable with the valuation. Shares trade at 131.6 times trailing price-to-earnings (P/E) after more than doubling in the past year. Like the AI boom, though, perhaps the obesity drug frenzy could exceed past even the wildest analyst expectations on Wall Street, which could make Eli Lilly’s premium worth paying. Personally, I think a small partial position in the name can’t hurt if you’re keen on investing in GLP-1 drugs.', 'LLY stock is a Strong Buy, according to analysts, with 15 Buys and three Holds assigned in the past three months. The\xa0average LLY stock price target\xa0of $846.43 implies 9.1% upside potential.', 'Regeneron stock has been gaining in the past two years as well, now up 39% over the timespan. Of course, Regeneron isn’t even in the same league as Lilly when it comes to sheer momentum. That said, the company’s robust oncology pipeline (its linvoseltamab myeloma therapy was recently granted priority review from the FDA) and genetic medicine exposure make the biotech firm a top candidate to extend its run. Given the firm’s unique strengths in its corner of biotech, I can’t help but stay bullish.', 'Undoubtedly, oncology and genomics are two of the toughest areas of medicine to work in. In a recent sitdown with Mad Money host Jim Cramer, CEO Leonard Schleifer commented that gene therapy could be even bigger than AI for the biotech industry. He’s right. Gene therapy could be just as big as AI, especially as it applies to gene-editing tech (CRISPR) across various therapeutics.', 'At 27.8 times trailing P/E, shares are considerably cheaper than the biotech industry average of 48.4 times. If you seek genomics innovation at a reasonable price, REGN stock looks like a potentially solid bet.', 'Regeneron stock is a Strong Buy, according to analysts, with 17 Buys, three Holds, and one Sell assigned in the past three months. The\xa0average REGN stock price target\xa0of $1,037.89 implies 9.1% upside potential.', 'BioHaven is a mid-cap biotech stock that’s been among the hottest in the industry lately. Since its IPO in September 2022, the stock has gained 596%. That’s an absurd surge and one that may be far from over as the incredibly innovative firm looks to solve the issue of muscle loss while taking weight-loss drugs. Despite recent momentum, I’m staying bullish on BioHaven, just like many analysts covering the name.', 'Beyond obesity drugs, which are red-hot right now, the firm also has an enviable drug pipeline for a firm its size. With intriguing neuroscience programs in place, BioHaven is potentially starring in a massive market that it could dominate should its treatments continue to show promise through remaining clinical trials.', 'Recently, UBS (NYSE:UBS) initiated BHVN stock at a Buy, praising its “diverse set of innovative programs” and potential for its obesity drug. I couldn’t agree more. BioHaven may very well be one of the most exciting (and innovative) biotech lightweights on the market right now. The firm has the potential to make a massive splash if any one of its innovations turns into a blockbuster. That alone makes BHVN stock worth watching, if not buying, following the latest 13% pullback off highs.', 'BioHaven stock is a Strong Buy, according to analysts, with nine unanimous Buys assigned in the past three months. The\xa0average BHVN stock price target\xa0of $59.11 implies 13.1% upside potential.', 'Undoubtedly, biotech may hold growth trends that may just be able to rival AI. From obesity drugs to gene therapy, the following trio of highly innovative biotechs seem too intriguing to pass up. At this juncture, analysts see the most upside from BHVN stock (13.1%) for the year ahead.', 'Disclosure']"

The ex-dividend date occurs one day before the record date which is the day on which shareholders need to be on the company's books in order to receive a dividend. The ex-dividend date is important as the process of settlement involves two full business days. So if you miss that date, you would not show up on the company's books on the record date. Accordingly, Gap investors that purchase the stock on or after the 9th of April will not receive the dividend, which will be paid on the 1st of May."", ""The company's upcoming dividend is US$0.15 a share, following on from the last 12 months, when the company distributed a total of US$0.60 per share to shareholders. Based on the last year's worth of payments, Gap stock has a trailing yield of around 2.3% on the current share price of US$25.88. Dividends are a major contributor to investment returns for long term holders, but only if the dividend continues to be paid. So we need to check whether the dividend payments are covered, and if earnings are growing."", ' See our latest analysis for Gap ', 'Dividends are usually paid out of company profits, so if a company pays out more than it earned then its dividend is usually at greater risk of being cut.

If earnings fall far enough, the company could be forced to cut its dividend. Gap's earnings per share have fallen at approximately 12% a year over the previous five years. When earnings per share fall, the maximum amount of dividends that can be paid also falls."", ""Another key way to measure a company's dividend prospects is by measuring its historical rate of dividend growth. It looks like the Gap dividends are largely the same as they were 10 years ago. If a company's dividend stays flat while earnings are in decline, this is typically a sign that it is paying out a larger percentage of its earnings. This can become unsustainable if earnings fall far enough."", ""Is Gap worth buying for its dividend? Gap has comfortably low cash and profit payout ratios, which may mean the dividend is sustainable even in the face of a sharp decline in earnings per share. Still, we consider declining earnings to be a warning sign. While it does have some good things going for it, we're a bit ambivalent and it would take more to convince us of Gap's dividend merits."", ""So while Gap looks good from a dividend perspective, it's always worthwhile being up to date with the risks involved in this stock.

Founded in 1972, the group, Murray says, iswhy ""a big business lobbying organization"" that is the ""business community\'s main point of contact with the politicians in Washington."" Robbins succeeds Mary Barra, Chair and CEO of General Motors, in the role.', 'During the interview, which took place at the CEO Initiative dinner, Murray and Robbins discussed the state of stakeholder capitalism, how much influence the Business Roundtable yields, and whether or not American industries should receive government subsidies. Murray also tried to prompt Robbins to reveal which ""presidential candidate gets you closer to what you want?""', 'Co-host Michal Lev-Ram joins Murray for the pre-interview conversation.', 'Listen to the episode or read the transcript below.', 'This transcript has been edited for clarity.', 'Alan Murray:\xa0Leadership Next\xa0is powered by the folks at\xa0Deloitte\xa0who, like me, are exploring the changing rules of business leadership and how CEOs are navigating this change.', 'Welcome to\xa0Leadership Next, the podcast about the changing rules of business leadership. And Michal, missed you again on this one. We got to stop splitting like this. You know what we needed? We needed you in New York for this interview.', ""Michal Lev-Ram: Well, I was at a dinner in San Francisco at the same time, but we need the stars to align at some point and to be in the same city on the same day, Alan. That's the ticket here. But tell me about the conversation. You got to interview Chuck Robbins, the chair and CEO of Cisco, and you've interviewed him plenty of times before, but what was what was different about this one?"", 'Murray:\xa0Well, as you know, Michal, we\'ve been doing this podcast for four years now. This is the first time, the first time we\'ve had a repeat guest. Chuck Robbins had been on before to talk about the work he\'s doing at Cisco. But at the CEO Initiative dinner in New York, I said, ""Look, we\'re not going to talk about that. What I want to talk about is your new role as chairman of the Business Roundtable, because it\'s an incredibly interesting position to be in at a time when politics is as fraught is as it is."" The Business Roundtable is the business community\'s main point of contact with the politicians in Washington. It\'s a big business lobbying organization. And he just took over the lead.', 'Lev-Ram: So Alan, were you able to talk to him about the upcoming election and how he sees the Business Roundtable interacting, working with the next president, whoever that is?', ""Murray:\xa0Oh, I certainly did. I did my best on that. Look, you know, you're dealing with two candidates who have both been in office before, and the Business Roundtable has had to work with both of them. So I asked him straight out which one did he prefer."", ""Lev-Ram: Well, and on a much lighter note, I understand you're both Tar Heels. So did you get to bond over that a bit?"", ""Murray:\xa0Oh, absolutely. We did. The difference between him and me, though, is I just went and watched the games. He played as a freshman. He played for Coach Roy Williams who tried to get him to stay. He told a funny story about that. I won't spoil the punchline but it's in the interview."", ""Lev-Ram: Well, with that, go Heels and let's dive into the story."", ""Murray:\xa0First of all, thank you all again for coming. Chuck, thank you for being part of the conversation. Great to have you here. You've had an amazing run as CEO of Cisco. You've doubled the stock price. You've changed the business model towards recurring revenue. But that's not what I want to talk about today."", 'Chuck Robbins: I know what you want to talk about.', ""Murray:\xa0Yeah, you have another job as chair of the Business Roundtable, and I'd really love to focus on some of the issues you're dealing with. But the first question I want to ask you is every CEO I talked to, probably every CEO in this room, says to me these days, I don't want to have anything to do with politics. Keep me away from politics. Keep me as far from Washington as you possibly can. And you dove in head first."", 'Robbins: I\'m an idiot. I joke with everybody, I said, ""There must be eight or nine people who said no to this job before I said yes."" I actually shared that with the Speaker of the House, Mike Johnson, and he said, “Well, there are 15 before me.”', ""Murray:\xa0That's true. That's true. But why did you do it?"", ""Robbins: Look, it's important and it matters. And I am, I'm like a senior citizen in the CEO ranks these days. You know, I feel like I just started, but somehow I'm like…"", 'Murray:\xa0Nine years is a long time.', ""Robbins: It is a long time. And we need to have a voice and we need to try to continue to drive pragmatism into the otherwise crazy world that we all live in right now. And I'm game to give it a try."", 'Murray:\xa0But I would argue, having watched this for four decades, much of the time in Washington, I would argue that the BRT has less influence today than it probably had at any time in those four decades.', ""Robbins: I think on the surface you could make that argument. I think behind the scenes it may not be as true as you think. You know, all the public discussion isn't necessarily what happens behind closed doors. I mean, people have to get elected and they have to do these things. And there have been lots of times over the years where people that we know, and my wife and I know, have called out bigwig CEOs on social media. And it's sort of unfortunately the game that they have to play right now. But it is different. It's different that in the past with Republican administrations, we typically would have a lot of progress and a lot of success, and we would have success with Democrat administrations as well. But right now it seems like both sides have issues with the business community. But at the end of the day, this is the greatest country in the world. The free markets and capitalism have been a big part of creating why this country is the greatest country in the world. Job creation, worker education, and I said this in one of my interviews after taking this job, the Business Roundtable is filled with patriots who want this country to win, and want this country to succeed, and want to help solve some of the problems in the country. And that's why they stay engaged, and that's why I'm engaged."", ""Murray:\xa0So, let's talk about some of the specifics. You talked about free trade. Global open trade is what built many of the businesses in the Business Roundtable, including yours, an extraordinary period of freer and expanding trade. We now seem to have gone into reverse, with massive tariffs, threats of much greater tariffs, some of the things that Trump has said recently, 60% tariffs, even on products coming from Mexico, friendshoring. What's the Business Roundtable position on that?"", ""Robbins: We're trying to continue to espouse the benefits of trade, responsible good trade agreements, and we think that they are good for the American economy. I said on an interview I did recently, these tariffs are passed on to the consumers. So they're inflationary by nature. At the end of the day, if you build responsible, well-constructed trade agreements, they're good for America, they're good for jobs, they create jobs. If we build barriers to where U.S. multinationals can't sell effectively overseas, then we're not going to be investing as much as we are today in the United States. I mean, if I'm not selling effectively in other countries, when a high percentage of my R&D is happening in the United States, guess what? I'm going to cut my R&D."", 'Murray:\xa0And yet tariffs, restrictions on trade seem to be one of the few things that the two parties can agree on these days.', ""Robbins: Well, there's truth to that."", 'Murray:\xa0Do you think you can have an effect?', ""Robbins: I think we're going to continue to try to build the case."", ""Murray:\xa0And how do you feel about rising industrial policy? I mean, 20 years ago that was talked about in the same sentence as trade policy. You know, we don't do that. We don't subsidize industry. We just gave $20 billion to Intel today of taxpayer money. Is that a good thing? Is that something the Business Roundtable favors? Is that really different than trade restrictions?"", ""Robbins: Well, I think there are certain areas in technology where we, as a country, need to be better positioned than we are today. I've had this conversation in Washington a lot, some of them are significant long-term investments that given the public markets’ activism, and all the things that we see sometimes, it's very difficult to make those investments that aren't going to pay off for years and years down the line. And sometimes there's just new technology areas, new capabilities that we need to collectively do research and be prepared for and actually work on together. Around the world, there are other countries that are doing this already so that the U.S. companies are at a disadvantage when we go out to compete on a global basis. And so I think that there's some of that that is needed in order to do that."", ""Murray:\xa0You're okay with $20 billion for Intel of taxpayer money?"", ""Robbins: Yeah, because I'd like for them to be a source of building…"", 'Murray: …chips for you…', 'Robbins: …chips for you and for me.', ""Murray:\xa0Sure. Let's talk about immigration, because that was really where you focused at the Business Roundtable before you took on this job. If trade is the top thing that you can get bipartisan agreement on, immigration may be next. It's starting to move in the same direction. Where should we be on immigration? How much does it hurt companies like yours? And what hope do you have of getting to a sensible place?"", ""Robbins: It's a meaningful problem. And unfortunately, if you go back probably a year, there was significant alignment across both parties on this issue of immigration. Then politics get in the way and, you know, you get into the midterms and you can't give anybody a win in the midterms. So then you get into the presidential election and we've seen what the politics have affected, just decisions around the border crisis and all those kinds of things. I don't know if we'll ever get broad based, maybe we have to break it up and do it in small parts. And, you know, God bless Tim Cook. He's agreed to do another two years in the chair of the committee as I asked him to do that, because I did it for three years, I think, before he took it on. But we need high-skilled immigration. We need labor. We need, you know, hospitality labor. We need to deal with H-1Bs and spouses and families. We need to deal with DACA and Dreamers. And we do need more security at the border. That's absolutely something everybody agrees on almost every bit of it, but politics get in the way."", 'Murray:\xa0So which presidential candidate get you closer to what you want? Does it make a difference here? [Audience laughter.] You knew I was going to…', ""Robbins: You're a funny guy. You're a funny guy."", 'Murray:\xa0…ask that question.', ""Robbins: Look, the reality is, is that we as CEOs and we as a Business Roundtable, we're going to work with whoever is in the White House. It behooves us and it behooves our country for us to be supportive in trying to move forward pro-growth policies and America policies. And so the way we think about it is if we have a Trump administration or if we have a Biden administration, regardless, there are going to be things we can align on in both. I mean, you mentioned the CHIPS Act, right, that happened under a Biden administration. You probably wouldn't have believed that would happen under a Biden administration six or eight years ago. So we can align."", 'Murray:\xa0Kind of like the tax policy of the Trump administration, too.', 'Robbins: We think that the tax policy prior to that put the United States multinational companies in a very competitive disadvantage on a global basis. So, we felt like…', 'Murray:\xa0So when you add up all the pluses and minuses, how does it balance?', '[Quieter audience laughter.]', ""Robbins: We're going to work with whoever's in the White House."", ""Murray:\xa0So this group you're talking to, the Fortune CEO Initiative, is a group that was started in 2017 and was started specifically as a response partly to some of the chaos that was going on in the political world, partly to some of the pressing problems that existed in the world, was really started to say, what can we do as businesses with our superpowers to address some of the big social problems that the world is facing? That's why this group exists. It was a forerunner to what the Business Roundtable did in 2019. The redefinition of the purpose of the corporation, the whole stakeholder capitalism movement. We've now been through two years of pretty intense political pushback there. A lot of people in this room can testify to what some of that pushback has been. Where is stakeholder capitalism today, in your view?"", ""Robbins: Well, I still think it's important. What I struggle with is the following: If we create an environment that's good for our employees, that's a good thing. If we create an environment that creates healthy communities, that's a good thing. If we also create an environment that has positive returns for our shareholders, positive outcomes for our customers, positive outcomes for our partners, what's bad about that? I just don't understand. No, I think the question of how you go about it is what's being challenged, and the question of quotas and things of that nature, I think are legitimate discussions to have. But focusing on ensuring that, I mean our purpose statement as a company is to power an inclusive future for all. And we live it, and we believe it, and we walk it and it's through our technology where we connect people around the world who have never been connected before, and they find themselves with an opportunity to be educated, to actually receive certain types of health care to, and now after the pandemic, they can actually get jobs where they are and work from where they are. And then the community service stuff that we do, we think, why would we not want a healthy community?"", ""Murray:\xa0But you're at the top of the heap. I mean, you by the way, I should have said at the outset, Cisco year after year is number one or number two on our list of best companies to work for. Consistently. So you focus a lot on your employees and obviously on your customers. And when you look at the Business Roundtable or the broader business community, do you see companies backing off those kinds of commitments because of the political pressure?"", 'Robbins: No, I think what you see is, let me give you an example. When when we started focusing on gender diversity, what we did is, we just wanted to make sure we had a slate of candidates that was representative of the population. And then we wanted to have interview panels that were representative of the population. And then the best candidate has to win, right? And we never said like, well, we got to get to 35% of something. And I think that\'s where the problem comes in because I actually believe, let’s say we\'re focused on trying to increase our gender diversity at the leadership level, if you start letting numbers drive your decisions, it\'s a disservice to the actual gender population. The people that you\'re actually trying to help, it’s a disservice because people look and say, ""Well, they all got in because there\'s a 35% number you\'re trying to hit."" And that\'s just that doesn\'t help. And so I think you have to go about this in a way that\'s practical and that\'s constructive, and I think that\'s the key. And at Business Roundtable we\'re actually trying to help our member companies just think through how to do that in a responsible way and still focus on doing the right thing.', '[Music starts.]', 'Murray:\xa0Jason Girzadas, the CEO of Deloitte US, is the sponsor of this podcast and joins me today. Welcome, Jason.', ""Jason Girzadas: Thank you, Alan. It's great to be here."", ""Murray:\xa0Jason, Leadership Next was created around this idea of stakeholder capitalism, but there's clearly been political pushback to that idea. And there's also economic pressure as the economy slows down. How do you serve all stakeholders? How do leaders balance the need to deliver profit and return on investment on the one hand, while also prioritizing the needs of these increasingly diverse stakeholders that they have to respond to?"", ""Girzadas: Yeah, decision making in this environment is not easy, that's for sure. The historic norms of simply looking at ROI from a financial lens is insufficient, quite honestly. What we've seen in some of what we've tried to do ourselves, is open up the aperture to recognize that there are actually multiple lenses that need to be utilized when evaluating significant decisions. How does a decision impact the workforce? How does it impact the societal stakeholders in whatever that decision may be? And so I think that a disciplined, multifaceted set of value drivers and value stakeholders will be increasingly a more common part of all decision making at board and executive levels. That discipline, Alan, will make it easier to actually be more cognizant and inclusive of the multiple stakeholders in making significant decisions. Now, that doesn't mean that the financial returns and expectations become secondary. I just think they're more balanced with the considerations with other stakeholder needs."", 'Murray:\xa0Jason, thanks for your perspective and thanks for sponsoring Leadership Next.', 'Girzadas: Thank you.', '[Music ends.]', ""Murray:\xa0I want to ask you the question that we're going to ask each of these tables to deal with over their main course, which is when you look at the rest of the year, rest of 2024, what do you see as the top risk and the top opportunity facing business?"", 'Robbins: Wow.', 'Murray: You only get one. Actually, you can do more than one, but you might miss your point.', ""Robbins: I, look I don't remember when we've had so many hot spots, right? I mean, there's so much going on yet the world continues to be fairly resilient from an economic perspective. And I think part of it is because the leaders in this room and the leaders of the Business Roundtable, most of us have basically grown as executives during a constant time of crisis. It's like you go back to the dot com crisis. So it's been a long road. I mean, there's always been something unbelievable going on. And I used to joke with our employees, I wake up every day and look at my phone to see what have I got to deal with that happened overnight. And I think that the resilience is incredible. However, you've got lots of issues going on. You've got 60 countries around the world greater than half the population voting. You've got a U.S. election that is going to be highly contentious. You've got U.S.-China geopolitical risk, you've got nationalism occurring all around the world and more nationalism happening where countries are trying to figure out can they count on the U.S.? Can they not count on the U.S.? And it's creating all of our businesses, if you're operating outside the United States, you're feeling it where they're saying, if you want to do business here, therefore you must do this. And it's slightly different in every one, which by definition for them is inflationary because it costs us more to do things the way they want to do them. But they're they're more focused on their ability to sustain as a country. So I don't think there's just one."", ""Murray: But maybe I listen to you. You're basically saying politics. And we are in an extraordinarily political and geopolitical…"", ""Robbins: Yeah, I think that's the case."", ""Murray: That's the biggest risk."", 'Robbins: For sure.', 'Murray: How about the opportunity?', ""Robbins: The biggest opportunity I see is as and everybody gets excited, but we haven't talked about, gee, AI. I mean, I haven't had a conversation in this long without talking…"", 'Murray: We went almost 19 minutes.', ""Robbins: Yeah, it's never happened."", 'Murray: Awesome.', ""Robbins: The thing that makes me very optimistic is that all the technology that we have, all the things that are emerging, everything that we've done over the last, there's so much negative noise about it and there's so much risk associated with some of the stuff. But it really gives us an opportunity to go attack some of the biggest systemic problems in the world. And I think there's a lot of people who believe that. And I think that's why I'm optimistic. There's a lot we can do."", 'Murray: Last question, actually, can I ask you two questions? Sure.

Junior varsity.', 'Murray: Roy Williams tried to get you to keep playing.', 'Robbins: He did.', ""Murray: And you said, I'm going to go off and be CEO of Cisco."", ""Robbins: When I, after my freshman year, I had a really good freshman year and I was playing JV and practicing a fair amount with the Varsity. And I called Roy and said, I'm not going to play anymore. And he's like, You are going to regret this one day. And so then I became CEO of Cisco, and the next time I saw him, he said, I guess everything worked out okay. We still joked, I'll see him at every game. I guess you saw him there when we were. We went to the game together."", 'Murray: Chuck had seats on the floor in the...', ""Robbins: This is recorded and being published everywhere. You don't have to tell everything."", ""Murray: It’s on the record. They're right there with you. I'm sure the camera catches you. You know, last question, because I do want to go back to that extraordinary performance on the hundred best places to work list. You've worked hard over the last nine years to create an extraordinary culture. Everybody in this room would like a culture like you have. What can you tell people here about how you did it?"", ""Robbins: Wow. Well, I think when we, I think when I took over in the U.S., we were number 82 and I had to write a thesis for the board, a strategic thesis when I was competing for the job, and I actually wrote a line in there, I said, I want Cisco to be the best place to work in the world. It was just a throwaway. And then all of a sudden we were rated the best place to work in the world about five years in or six years in. We didn't have a strategy. But then I thought and said, okay, what did we do? What do I think we did that actually…work and life is so blended. And I joke a lot about when I was growing up, my dad, I had a work dad and a home Dad. My dad would get up in the morning, he put on a suit and you could just see he would transform into work."", ""And then he'd come home and he'd get undressed and he’d become Dad again. And I know I don't, and I think our employees, they don't want you to be something you're not. They don't want me to be something I'm not, and I can't be. And so I am super transparent. I've told our employees, I'll answer any question you ask me if it doesn't put me in jail or put the company at risk. If it puts one of my leadership team in jail, we'll talk about it."", ""But we communicate so frequently. We do it once a month. We do an entire employee video call once a month. During the pandemic we were doing them once a week. And we're just honest, authentic. And I mean, you know, you can imagine the questions we've taken over the years about the stuff going on in the world and the desire for CEOs to have active voices on social issues and all these things. If you'd ever told me I'd be writing an email to the company on Roe v. Wade? I'm like, you’ve got to be crazy. I wrote an email on Roe v. Wade, and, you know, everybody doesn't agree, but we're just we're just super honest and we communicate frequently, authentically, honestly."", 'Murray: And you hold people accountable.', ""Robbins: And we do hold people accountable. When I took over, everybody said Cisco's a family as well. That's great. In my family, I'm accountable. My kids are accountable. I'm always accountable. If I screw up, I guarantee you I'm accountable. You can be a family, but you still have to be accountable. It doesn't mean you don't have hard decisions you have to make. And so we've gotten into a little bit of the family thing, which is great. We were able to preserve the family thing but build accountability and competitiveness."", ""And the other thing I'd say we did is, I bet all of your organizations are filled with people who actually love doing things in their communities and making their communities better. They do. That's just human nature. It's been clear to me, 80 to 90% of our employees want to do something in the community, and we just empowered them to do it and we made it okay for them to do it. And we tell them go. We give them time to go volunteer. I tell them openly, if it's three in the afternoon and your child has a soccer game, you better be at the soccer game because I'm sure at 9:00 at night you're going to be responding to those emails that you missed. That's just the way it works. And so, I think it's just it's really just, you know, treat all your employees the way you want to be treated. Even when we have to make the tough, hard decisions, like we just we just had a 5% reduction."", 'Murray: Yeah.', 'Robbins: But the way you do it and the way you treat them, they remember—even in the toughest times.', ""Murray: Yeah. Thank you for that. That's, that's in fact, I think that deserves a round of applause."", 'Robbins: Thank you', 'Murray:\xa0Leadership Next\xa0is edited by Nicole Vergara.', 'Michal Lev-Ram:\xa0Our executive producer is Chris Joslin.', 'Murray:\xa0Our theme is by Jason Snell.', 'Lev-Ram:\xa0Leadership Next\xa0is a production of\xa0Fortune Media.', 'Murray:\xa0Leadership Next\xa0episodes are produced by\xa0Fortune’s editorial team.
