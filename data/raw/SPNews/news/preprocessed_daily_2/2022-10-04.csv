As long as traders can focus on the underlying fundamentals and maintain a long-term view, bargains during a bear market can be very profitable.In my and Wade’s view, the best stocks right now are positioned to take advantage of the economy’s problems, namely inflation, rising interest rates, and slowing growth. Or at least the best stocks are those that are most insulated from the problems in the economy.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsWith that, I’d like to give you a list of our top stocks for the rest of this year – and into 2023…It’s Time: Get Prepared for the Incoming Market ShockInflation and a bear market are nothing compared to what’s around the corner, and millions are about to be blindsided. Make sure you’re not one of them.We just released key details on what’s about to happen and how to prepare yourself – including the kind of stocks you need to dump immediately, and 10 stocks you’ll want to own.Click here to watch now.2023 Stock No. 1: AutoZone Inc. ()Recently, I was shopping for a new car and decided on the Ford Maverick. I was anxious to get started because I knew there would be an order process to wade through. However, when I finally called the dealer, I was informed that demand is so high and supplies were so low I would not even be able to place an order.With rising auto costs, a potential economic slowdown, and low supply, there are plenty of folks in my situation. I will just have to wait if I don’t want to pay more than MSRP on the secondary market. In the meantime, I will do what millions of other Americans will do: “Fix it up, wear it out, make it do, or do without.”The bottom line is that auto supplies, repairs, and equipment will continue to be in demand.We like AutoZone as a way to take advantage of the problems automakers (and their customers) are dealing with. We think being an AZO buyer on the dips is a profit opportunity until automaker supply constraints start to loosen.Story continues2023 Stock No. 2: The Charles Schwab Corp. ()Did you know your broker makes money from you in more ways than commissions? They aren’t always so forthcoming about the revenues they extract from you, but in most cases, these revenue streams are tied to interest rates.As rates rise, it positively affects net margins, driving profits higher. Payment for order flow, margin interest, and share lending are examples of how brokerages like Robinhood Markets Inc. (HOOD) can stay in business despite charging no commissions.For example, if you have a margin account, your broker can “borrow” your shares and lend them to short-sellers. They don’t pay you anything for that access, but they charge interest on the margin used by the short-seller to hold their position. The higher rates rise, the larger the margin is for brokers.While all those income strategies are bad for a broker’s customers, they are good for a broker’s shareholders. In that sector, we like Schwab, which we know looks like a bit of a dog right now, but that is normal for bear markets.If interest rates remain high and market conditions stabilize (or, dare we hope, improve…?), then SCHW should see a big move higher. Schwab has been acquiring customers through acquisitions, which gives them the scale to amplify their profits once, the market starts to settle and trading balances rise again.2023 Stock No. 3: Costco Wholesale Corp. ()A rising dollar is a big problem for large caps – especially technology companies because the profits they earn outside the United States are converted back into fewer, stronger dollars. However, what if a large percentage of your revenue comes from imported products that are cheaper in stronger dollar terms?A strong dollar is why we still like the discount-retail space. We think that fears about consumer spending have been overblown. As long as hiring remains positive, spending should continue to rise, which means retail firms are in a position to benefit from a strong dollar.Costco’s fundamentals look good, and the issues squeezing margins should be offset in the short-term with the company’s advantages due to a strong dollar. We think buying this deeply-discounted deep-discounter on the dips makes sense.2023 Stock No. 4: Starbucks Corp. ()Retail services stocks aren’t immune from inflation problems, but some companies have strategies to deal with it.For example, Starbucks frequently deals with inflation-deflation cycles in their raw materials (coffee beans). From the bottom of the pandemic bear market to the top at the end of 2021, coffee prices rose 100%, while SBUX shares rallied 89%.General inflation is more complicated for SBUX to deal with than just rising coffee prices. Still, the point is that the firm is already good at making adjustments to maintain price stability. That’s why we expect SBUX to stay off its lows and rally in the short-term while consumer spending remains strong.2023 Stock No. 5: Waste Management Inc. ()It usually makes sense in a volatile market to focus on defensive, dividend-paying stocks. That is still true now, but because interest rates and inflation are rising, traditional dividend strategies don’t work as well. Future dividends are worth less when interest rates rise because the present value of those income streams is lower.However, if a company has a defensible near-monopoly on their customer base, positive margin trends, and historically has raised its dividend above inflation rates, then the old rules can still apply in an inflationary market. Waste Management is precisely that kind of company.WM’s efforts to harvest energy and byproducts from trash collection and landfills are just two examples of how the company is working to increase cash flows to keep its dividend payout ratio high and the yield ahead of inflation. As the pool of dividend stocks shrinks, we expect value investors to flow into the company’s shares in the short term.Regards,JohnP.S. Is This the End of the Bear Market?The system that predicted the current bear market just revealed what’s coming next. Will we turn the corner into profits? Or plummet even further? The answer is here.The post Setting Our Sights for 2023 appeared first on InvestorPlace.]"
2,7f23de1a-1001-35a0-b6f3-149a3928c288,TXN,2022-10-04,Possible bearish signals as Texas Instruments Incorporated (NASDAQ:TXN) insiders disposed of US$8.8m worth of stock,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/possible-bearish-signals-texas-instruments-110046382.html,1664881246,STORY,['TXN'],"[Over the past year, many Texas Instruments Incorporated (NASDAQ:TXN) insiders sold a significant stake in the company which may have piqued investors' interest. When analyzing insider transactions, it is usually more valuable to know whether insiders are buying versus knowing if they are selling, as the latter sends an ambiguous message. However, shareholders should take a deeper look if several insiders are selling stock over a specific time period.While insider transactions are not the most important thing when it comes to long-term investing, we would consider it foolish to ignore insider transactions altogether. See our latest analysis for Texas Instruments Texas Instruments Insider Transactions Over The Last YearThe Chairman, Richard Templeton, made the biggest insider sale in the last 12 months. That single transaction was for US$5.9m worth of shares at a price of US$178 each. While we don't usually like to see insider selling, it's more concerning if the sales take place at a lower price. It's of some comfort that this sale was conducted at a price well above the current share price, which is US$160. So it may not shed much light on insider confidence at current levels.In the last year Texas Instruments insiders didn't buy any company stock. The chart below shows insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last year. If you click on the chart, you can see all the individual transactions, including the share price, individual, and the date!insider-trading-volumeIf you like to buy stocks that insiders are buying, rather than selling, then you might just love this free list of companies. (Hint: insiders have been buying them).Insiders At Texas Instruments Have Sold Stock RecentlyOver the last three months, we've seen significant insider selling at Texas Instruments. Specifically, Senior Vice President of Sales &amp; Applications Mark Roberts ditched US$364k worth of shares in that time, and we didn't record any purchases whatsoever. In light of this it's hard to argue that all the insiders think that the shares are a bargain.Story continuesInsider OwnershipLooking at the total insider shareholdings in a company can help to inform your view of whether they are well aligned with common shareholders. Usually, the higher the insider ownership, the more likely it is that insiders will be incentivised to build the company for the long term. It's great to see that Texas Instruments insiders own 0.1% of the company, worth about US$161m. This kind of significant ownership by insiders does generally increase the chance that the company is run in the interest of all shareholders.So What Do The Texas Instruments Insider Transactions Indicate?An insider hasn't bought Texas Instruments stock in the last three months, but there was some selling. And even if we look at the last year, we didn't see any purchases. But since Texas Instruments is profitable and growing, we're not too worried by this. The company boasts high insider ownership, but we're a little hesitant, given the history of share sales. While we like knowing what's going on with the insider's ownership and transactions, we make sure to also consider what risks are facing a stock before making any investment decision. Case in point: We've spotted 3 warning signs for Texas Instruments you should be aware of, and 2 of these can't be ignored.But note: Texas Instruments may not be the best stock to buy. So take a peek at this free list of interesting companies with high ROE and low debt.For the purposes of this article, insiders are those individuals who report their transactions to the relevant regulatory body.

These non-GAAP financial measures are provided to enhance the reader's overall understanding of the Company's current financial performance and prospects for the future. Specifically, management believes that these non-GAAP measures provide useful information to investors by excluding or adjusting items for amortization of acquired intangible assets, share-based payment expense, acquisition-related items, impairment on investment, and special charges associated with continued efforts to streamline the organization and integrate recent acquisitions. FCF is provided to enhance the reader’s understanding of the Company’s ability to generate additional cash from its business. Management typically adjusts for these items for internal reviews of performance and uses the above non-GAAP measures for baseline comparative operational analysis, decision making, and other activities. Management believes these non-GAAP measures provide greater comparability and enhanced visibility into the Company’s results of operations as well as comparability with many of its peers, especially those companies focused more on technology and software. Non-GAAP financial measures included in this news release should be considered in addition to, and not as a substitute for or superior to, results prepared in accordance with GAAP.The most directly comparable GAAP measures for adjusted operating profit and adjusted operating profit margin for total company and by segment are “operating profit” and “operating profit margin,” respectively, for total company and by segment, which include the impact of amortization of acquired intangible assets, share-based payment expense, acquisition-related items, and special charges. Adjusted operating profit margin is adjusted operating profit divided by net sales for total company and by segment. The most directly comparable GAAP measures for adjusted net income and adjusted diluted EPS are “net income” and “diluted EPS,” respectively, which include the impact of amortization of acquired intangible assets, share-based payment expense, acquisition-related items, an impairment of investment, and special charges. Adjusted diluted EPS is adjusted net income divided by diluted weighted average shares outstanding. The most directly comparable GAAP measure for FCF is “net cash provided by operating activities, which includes the impact of purchases of property, plant and equipment.” The most directly comparable GAAP measure for EBITDA is “net income”, which includes the impact of net interest expense, income taxes, depreciation, and amortization of acquired intangible assets. The most directly comparable GAAP measure for adjusted EBITDA is “net income”, which includes the impact of net interest expense, income taxes, depreciation, amortization of acquired intangible assets, share-based payment expense, miscellaneous (income) expense, net, special charges, and acquisition-related items. A reconciliation of each measure to the most directly comparable GAAP measure is available in this news release. The Company’s non-GAAP financial measures may not be comparable to similarly titled non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies, have limitations as an analytical tool, and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for GAAP financial measures. Our presentation of such measures, which may include adjustments to exclude unusual or non-recurring items, should not be construed as an inference that our future results will be unaffected by other unusual or non-recurring items.Forward-Looking InformationThis press release includes “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, that are based on management’s beliefs and assumptions and information currently available to management.

6,5f4c1cf2-5f0e-3694-a8ef-a63673f26240,ARE,2022-10-04,3 Top-Ranked Dividend Stocks: A Smarter Way to Boost Your Retirement Income,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/3-top-ranked-dividend-stocks-131001177.html,1664802601,STORY,['ARE'],"[Believe it or not, seniors fear running out of cash more than they fear dying.Also, retirees who have constructed a nest egg have valid justifications to be concerned, since the traditional ways to plan for retirement may mean income can no longer cover expenses. Some retirees are now tapping their principal to make a decent living, pressed for time between decreasing investment balances and longer life expectancies.The tried-and-true retirement investing approach of yesterday doesn't work today.Years ago, investors at or close to retirement could put money into fixed-income assets and depend on appealing yields to generate consistent, solid pay streams to fund a comfortable retirement. 10-year Treasury bond rates in the late 1990s floated around 6.50%, but unfortunately, those days of being able to exclusively rely on Treasury yields to fund retirement income are over.The effect of this drop in rates is substantial: over 20 years, the change in yield for a $1 million investment in 10-year Treasuries is over $1 million.In addition to the considerable drop in bond yields, today's retirees are nervous about their future Social Security benefits. Because of certain demographic factors, it's been estimated that the funds that pay the Social Security benefits will run out of money in 2035.Unfortunately, it looks like the two traditional sources of retirement income - bonds and Social Security - may not be able to adequately meet the needs of present and future retirees. But what if there was another option that could provide a steady, reliable source of income in retirement?Invest in Dividend StocksDividend-paying stocks from low-risk, high-quality companies are a smart way to generate steady and reliable attractive income streams to replace low risk, low yielding Treasury and bond options.Look for stocks that have paid steady, increasing dividends for years (or decades), and have not cut their dividends even during recessions.Story continuesGoing beyond those familiar names, you can find excellent dividend-paying stocks by following a few guidelines. Look for companies that pay a dividend yield of around 3%, with positive annual dividend growth. The growth rate is key to help combat the effects of inflation.Here are three dividend-paying stocks retirees should consider for their nest egg portfolio.Armada Hoffler Properties (AHH) is currently shelling out a dividend of $0.19 per share, with a dividend yield of 7.32%. This compares to the REIT and Equity Trust - Residential industry's yield of 3.32% and the S&amp;P 500's yield of 1.87%. The company's annualized dividend growth in the past year was 6.25%. Check Armada Hoffler Properties (AHH) dividend history here&gt;&gt;&gt;Apple Hospitality REIT (APLE) is paying out a dividend of $0.07 per share at the moment, with a dividend yield of 5.97% compared to the REIT and Equity Trust - Other industry's yield of 4.49% and the S&amp;P 500's yield. The annualized dividend growth of the company was 1400% over the past year. Check Apple Hospitality REIT (APLE) dividend history here&gt;&gt;&gt;Currently paying a dividend of $1.18 per share, Alexandria Real Estate Equities (ARE) has a dividend yield of 3.37%. This is compared to the REIT and Equity Trust - Other industry's yield of 4.49% and the S&amp;P 500's current yield. Annualized dividend growth for the company in the past year was 5.36%. Check Alexandria Real Estate Equities (ARE) dividend history here&gt;&gt;&gt;But aren't stocks generally more risky than bonds?Yes, that's true. As a broad category, bonds carry less risk than stocks. However, the stocks we are talking about - dividend -paying stocks from high-quality companies - can generate income over time and also mitigate the overall volatility of your portfolio compared to the stock market as a whole.A silver lining to owning dividend stocks for your retirement portfolio is that many companies, especially blue chip stocks, increase their dividends over time, helping offset the effects of inflation on your potential retirement income.Thinking about dividend-focused mutual funds or ETFs? Watch out for fees.You may be thinking, ""I like this dividend strategy, but instead of investing in individual stocks, I'm going to find a dividend-focused mutual fund or ETF."" This approach can make sense, but be aware that some mutual funds and specialized ETFs carry high fees, which may reduce your dividend gains or income, and defeat the goal of this dividend investment approach. If you do wish to invest in a fund, do your research to find the best-quality dividend funds with the lowest fees.Bottom LinePursuing a dividend investing strategy can help protect your retirement portfolio. Whether you choose to invest in stocks or through low-fee mutual funds or ETFs, this approach can potentially help you achieve a more secure and enjoyable retirement.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

8,7536b269-323a-3512-9be5-caadb3cd06db,UNM,2022-10-04,Trupanion (TRUP) Banks on Geographical Expansion Amid Cost Woes,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/trupanion-trup-banks-geographical-expansion-132201910.html,1664803321,STORY,"['TRUP', 'EIG', 'UNM', 'AXS']","[Trupanion Inc.’s TRUP focus on pets’ health and well-being in an underpenetrated pet insurance market, product innovations, geographical expansion and a solid capital position poise it well for growth.Spending on pets’ health is on the rise in North America, with a total addressable market of $38.4 billion. This pet insurer operates in a large but underpenetrated market. Thus, TRUP has a wider scope to ramp up its growth. The insurer has a stellar track of delivering more than 20% top-line growth for the last 59 quarters.The average pet now stays with Trupanion for 79 months, up from 78 months in the year-ago period, ensuring consistent revenue generation. The higher retention rates indicate customers’ fondness for TRUP’s products.Trupanion remains focused on growing its addressable market by 40% by 2025-end, with the addition of 10,000 international hospitals. This will increase its overall market from 25,000 in North America to 35,000 globally. This, in turn, should help TRUP expand its active hospital base.Trupanion stated that over the long term, companies that can invest in innovation and expand their addressable market are poised to be successful. TRUP intends to expand globally by entering Japan and Europe.All these together should help TRUP achieve its target to sequentially grow subscription-adjusted operating income in the remaining quarters of 2022. For the fourth quarter of 2022, TRUP estimates subscription-adjusted operating income to grow in the range of 14-15%. Per a five-year plan, the insurer targets an adjusted operating margin of 25% by 2025.

11,553b6646-dd5e-30b5-bc86-8e9ab107e492,USB,2022-10-04,U.S. Bancorp (NYSE:USB) is a favorite amongst institutional investors who own 68%,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/u-bancorp-nyse-usb-favorite-110022138.html,1664881222,STORY,"['USB', 'USB-PQ']","[Every investor in U.S. Bancorp (NYSE:USB) should be aware of the most powerful shareholder groups. With 68% stake, institutions possess the maximum shares in the company. That is, the group stands to benefit the most if the stock rises (or lose the most if there is a downturn).Because institutional owners have a huge pool of resources and liquidity, their investing decisions tend to carry a great deal of weight, especially with individual investors. As a result, a sizeable amount of institutional money invested in a firm is generally viewed as a positive attribute.Let's take a closer look to see what the different types of shareholders can tell us about U.S. Bancorp. See our latest analysis for U.S. Bancorp ownership-breakdownWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About U.S. Bancorp?Institutions typically measure themselves against a benchmark when reporting to their own investors, so they often become more enthusiastic about a stock once it's included in a major index. We would expect most companies to have some institutions on the register, especially if they are growing.As you can see, institutional investors have a fair amount of stake in U.S. Bancorp. This implies the analysts working for those institutions have looked at the stock and they like it. But just like anyone else, they could be wrong. If multiple institutions change their view on a stock at the same time, you could see the share price drop fast. It's therefore worth looking at U.S. Bancorp's earnings history below. Of course, the future is what really matters.earnings-and-revenue-growthInvestors should note that institutions actually own more than half the company, so they can collectively wield significant power. Hedge funds don't have many shares in U.S. Bancorp. Berkshire Hathaway Inc. is currently the company's largest shareholder with 8.1% of shares outstanding. With 7.7% and 6.7% of the shares outstanding respectively, The Vanguard Group, Inc. and BlackRock, Inc. are the second and third largest shareholders.Story continuesOn studying our ownership data, we found that 25 of the top shareholders collectively own less than 50% of the share register, implying that no single individual has a majority interest.Researching institutional ownership is a good way to gauge and filter a stock's expected performance. The same can be achieved by studying analyst sentiments. There are plenty of analysts covering the stock, so it might be worth seeing what they are forecasting, too.Insider Ownership Of U.S. BancorpWhile the precise definition of an insider can be subjective, almost everyone considers board members to be insiders. Management ultimately answers to the board. However, it is not uncommon for managers to be executive board members, especially if they are a founder or the CEO.Insider ownership is positive when it signals leadership are thinking like the true owners of the company. However, high insider ownership can also give immense power to a small group within the company. This can be negative in some circumstances.Our most recent data indicates that insiders own less than 1% of U.S. Bancorp. Being so large, we would not expect insiders to own a large proportion of the stock. Collectively, they own US$85m of stock. It is always good to see at least some insider ownership, but it might be worth checking if those insiders have been selling. General Public OwnershipWith a 24% ownership, the general public, mostly comprising of individual investors, have some degree of sway over U.S. Bancorp. While this group can't necessarily call the shots, it can certainly have a real influence on how the company is run.Public Company OwnershipPublic companies currently own 8.1% of U.S. Bancorp stock. This may be a strategic interest and the two companies may have related business interests. It could be that they have de-merged. This holding is probably worth investigating further.Next Steps:While it is well worth considering the different groups that own a company, there are other factors that are even more important.Many find it useful to take an in depth look at how a company has performed in the past.

The Arkansas-based company recently faced pressure from Walmart, one of its major distributors, to curb emissions. Tyson achieved that by pushing its own suppliers to rein in greenhouse gases. (Michael Conroy / Associated Press)The Inflation Reduction Act is both the most important federal climate legislation ever and sadly inadequate to protect the U.S. and the world from the effects of climate change. Where it falls short, states could intervene with tougher regulations — but many won’t. That leaves corporations, which can pressure their suppliers to take the actions necessary to prevent global warming’s most devastating effects.Several expert assessments agree that the IRA will reduce U.S. greenhouse gas emissions by up to a billion tons per year by 2030.If fully realized, the IRA’s policies get us one-third of the way to a safe and stable climate, one that avoids global warming beyond two degrees Celsius above the preindustrial average. Where will the other two-thirds of emissions reductions come from?Between the Senate filibuster and the Supreme Court’s restrictive ruling in West Virginia vs. Environmental Protection Agency, it’s unlikely that major new federal legislation or regulations with carbon limits will emerge. State governments could act, but half of U.S. emissions come from states that are indifferent or hostile to reducing their emissions.A surprising ray of hope emerges from a new study showing that global supply chain contracting networks could play a role in climate change response. Corporations can require each supplier to cut emissions in order to continue doing business with them.According to CDP International, a nonprofit that manages corporate emissions disclosures, the average corporation’s supply chain is responsible for 11 times more emissions than the company itself, making the contracts that govern supply chains a powerful tool for climate mitigation. CDP’s analysis finds that existing supply chain contract requirements by 200 major corporations have induced almost 24,000 companies to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions. The result: Companies are rapidly cutting emissions from their supply chains, with 1.8 billion tons cut in 2021 alone.Story continuesIn comparison, the IRA is not expected to reach emissions reductions of 1 billion tons per year until 2030. Supply chain contracting is already doing more to reduce emissions than the IRA will eight years from now.Large companies such as Facebook, Google and Amazon have driven rapid growth of renewable energy, even in states with few climate change regulations. For instance, companies are imposing supply chain requirements on suppliers in the South, the region that has led the state-level resistance to climate change mitigation but has emissions roughly equal to those of Germany, the sixth- or seventh-highest-emitting country.Walmart, the largest retailer in the world, with thousands of suppliers, has worked with the Environmental Defense Fund and other environmental groups on Project Gigaton, which aims to eliminate a billion tons of carbon emissions from Walmart’s supply chain between 2017 and 2030. That would have the same impact as Germany becoming carbon neutral a year ahead of schedule.Facing pressure as a leading Walmart supplier, Tyson Foods recently worked with the Environmental Defense Fund to reduce carbon emissions from its own suppliers — and that’s how the “chain” comes into play. Tyson was recognized as one of Walmart’s 1,029 ""Giga Gurus,"" a group of suppliers that agree to set carbon emissions goals, share them publicly, and report avoided emissions in the last year — the same types of action that a government regulatory program would require.Ingersoll Rand, based in North Carolina, responded to pressure from its corporate customers by developing more sustainable transport options. Kimberly-Clark, the Texas-based maker of Huggies and dozens of other everyday products, is pushing its timber suppliers in Alabama and Mississippi to improve climate-related forestry practices. Missouri-based beer giant Anheuser-Busch has committed to powering its U.S. brewing and production facilities with renewable power — and it has developed a program to encourage decarbonization by its suppliers and its suppliers’ suppliers. Politics doesn’t have to get involved. Many of these corporations are hardly known for being progressive.Private-sector initiatives have the potential to step in where government has failed to curb emissions and also reduce the partisan gridlock behind those failures. Most people in the U.S., including a majority of Democrats, think big government is a greater threat to the nation than big business, and this mistrust reduces support for climate policy. Learning about nongovernmental responses to climate change can boost conservatives’ and moderates’ trust in climate science and support for government action.Of course, we shouldn’t fall into the common trap of the “panacea bias,” which leads people to consider only actions or policies that single-handedly solve complex problems. Such policies don’t exist for a problem as large as climate change.Rather, we must address large, messy problems with as many smaller actions as possible: some by the federal government, some by state or local governments, some by private businesses or other organizations.The Inflation Reduction Act is an important step for climate policy in the United States, and it will do a great deal to help our nation meet its climate goals. But it will not hit those targets on its own. Private-sector actions, such as environmental supply chain contracting, can fill the gaps that remain to secure a more stable climate.Michael P.

Other issues in the Disney story have been the adverse impact of coronavirus on theme park business, higher programming and production costs at Linear Networks, heavy investments on Disney+, and a leveraged balance sheet.However, the company is benefitting from the growing popularity of Disney+, owing to a strong content portfolio and a cheaper bundle offering.

The Zacks analyst believes that Kimberly-Clark has been battling high input costs for a while now.

Key input costs are estimated to escalate $1.4-$1.6 billion in 2022.Nonetheless, the company has been benefiting from its three growth pillars. These include focus on improving its core business in the developed markets, speeding up growth in the Personal Care segment in developing and emerging markets and enhancing digital and e-commerce capacities.

23,da47c366-3a48-3e9f-9c64-64e9472e198d,JWN,2022-10-04,Nordstrom (JWN) Banks on Solid Online Show Amid Inflation,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/nordstrom-jwn-banks-solid-online-141002572.html,1664806202,STORY,"['JWN', 'TPR']","[With consumers returning to normalcy and the resumption of outdoor activities, Nordstrom Inc. JWN has been witnessing sturdy demand for men's and shoes, and women's apparel and beauty. Gains from strategic initiatives and strong anniversary sales, driven by improved customer experience and increased engagement, bode well. A solid e-commerce business acts as an upside.This led to impressive second-quarter fiscal 2022 results, wherein the top and bottom lines surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate. Adjusted earnings of 81 cents per share reflected a sharp improvement from the year-ago figure of 49 cents. Total revenues grew 12% year over year to $4,095 million, marking the eighth straight quarter of sequential top-line growth. Net sales advanced 12% year over year to $3,991 million, while credit card net revenues grew 13% from the prior-year quarter to $104 million.That said, let’s take a look into factors that have been supporting JWN’s growth story.Online Strength, A Major DriverThe company remains focused on advancing in the technology space by boosting e-commerce and digital networks, and improving its supply-chain channels and marketing efforts. Second-quarter fiscal 2022 digital sales rose 6.3% year over year, driven by the shift in the timing of the anniversary sale. The metric also represented 38% of net sales. The digital business witnessed gains from improved digital traffic across both Nordstrom and Nordstrom Rack, as well as increased utilization of the buy online, pick up in-store service.As part of its market strategy, the company launched additional pickup options, which received positive customer feedback. buy online pick up in store remains one of the most-used services. In the fiscal second quarter, Nordstrom expanded its next-day order pickup service to more than 60 additional Rack stores. Its styling services, which form part of its Closer to You strategy, have been performing well.Going ahead, management expects to expedite delivery, expand distribution and fulfillment centers, and the market level selection for in-store shopping, as well as same-day and next-day pickup. The company earlier completed the integration of Rack.com onto Nordstrom.com, offering a better customer experience.Other notable retailers that retained their solid online shows include Hibbett HIBB, American Eagle AEO and Tapestry TPR.Hibbett witnessed year-over-year e-commerce sales growth of 8.3% in second-quarter fiscal 2023, driven by better inventory, robust traffic across website and app, and improved digital customer experience. The metric rose 174.4% on a three-year basis. HIBB accounted for 15.2% of the total sales, up from 13.1% in the prior-year quarter.Hibbett remains focused on leveraging its omni-channel capabilities such as home delivery, buy online and pick-up in store, reserve online and pick-up in store, buy online ship to store facility, same day delivery, and mobile app services to fulfill online orders and serve customers.In second-quarter fiscal 2022, American Eagle’s digital revenues advanced 60% from the pre-pandemic levels (second-quarter fiscal 2019). The metric accounted for 33% of the total revenues compared with 24% in second-quarter fiscal 2019. This was driven by AEO’s mobile app, which is now the largest source of revenues in the digital channel.Recently, American Eagle launched a mobile point-of-sale system in its North America stores, allowing customers to check out or return items through a store associate. Some other notable efforts include customer self-checkout, a new instant credit feature for returns, the expansion of its Afterpay capabilities in its mobile app, and the introduction of Shop the Look service that allows customers to browse and shop head-to-toe looks curated by stylists.In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022, Tapestry’s global digital sales increased in the high-single digits, and represented roughly 30% of the total revenues. In fiscal 2022, TPR generated digital sales of $2 billion, more than tripling from that reported in fiscal 2019 pre-pandemic, and accounting for 30% of the total revenues.By brand, digital sales increased roughly 30% at Coach, mid-teens at Kate Spade and nearly 25% at Stuart Weitzman in the fiscal year. Tapestry has been expanding its digital distribution channels with a focus on enhancing curbside or store pickup service, as well as contactless payment options, and the opportunity to make virtual appointments.Story continuesOther Growth EffortsComing back to JWN, it is focused on its long-term strategy, aiming at enhancing its digital-first platform, expanding the reach of Nordstrom Rack, gaining market share and delivering growth. As part of the strategy, the company continues to scale enhanced capabilities like the expansion of order pickup and ship-to-store to all Nordstrom Rack stores. It noted that nearly 40% of next-day orders were picked up from Rack stores during the anniversary sale.As part of its closer-to-you strategy, the company aims to link stores and services to expedite deliveries, expand online offerings, and add cheaper merchandise at its Rack off-price stores to improve customers’ shopping experiences. It is also on track to integrate Nordstrom Rack assets and offer a wide range of price points offered at Nordstrom Rack. Increased focus on distribution capabilities, along with improved connectivity of physical and digital inventory, is likely to contribute to Nordstrom Rack sales by $2 billion in the long term.Management envisions its digital unit to account for 50% of the total sales. Apart from these, a rise in new customers, enhanced personalization and expanded product offering are expected to aid revenue growth, profit margin and cash flow generation.Headwinds to OvercomeDespite such upsides, Nordstrom slashed its fiscal 2022 view on declining discretionary spending stemming from inflation. The company expects total year-over-year revenue growth of 5-7%, down from the aforementioned 6-8% rise. Adjusted earnings are envisioned to be $2.30-$2.60, which compares unfavorably with the prior stated $3.20-$3.50. The EBIT margin is likely to be 4.5-4.9%, down from the earlier mentioned 5.8-6.2%. Adjusted EBIT is expected to be 4.3-4.7%, down from the prior stated 5.6-6%.For fiscal 2022, the gross profit is envisioned to remain flat year over year. Also, clearance activity and higher markdowns are likely to affect the gross profit by $200 million.For the fiscal third quarter, it expects a mid-single-digit decline in revenues, as evident from the demand deceleration seen in the latter part of the second quarter. Also, the EBIT margin is likely to be down 200 bps year over year.The company has been witnessing sluggish demand due to rising inflation. It expects a competitive promotional environment in retail in the second half of fiscal 2022. As a result, it has been making efforts to clear excess inventory by the end of fiscal 2022. The move is likely to hurt margins to some extent in the near term.Wrapping UpWe hope that despite sluggish demand and inflationary pressure, Nordstrom will stay afloat, driven by strong demand, a solid online show and a long-term growth strategy.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

AEG recently announced that the third tranche of its EUR300-million share repurchase program, approved in March, will commence from Oct 3, 2022 and likely close on or before Dec 15 of this year.In the above-mentioned time frame, Aegon will buy back common shares worth EUR133 million to neutralize the dilutive impact of the 2022 interim dividend paid out in shares.The repurchased shares will be held as treasury shares and utilized for paying out future stock dividends via shares. This decision follows the consent of AEG’s shareholders, majority (60%) of whom voted in favor of receiving the final dividend in the form of shares.On the same day of announcing the duration of the third tranche of the authorized buyback plan, AEG also notified the completion of the second tranche of the same buyback program. The second tranche, spanning from Jul 7 to Sep 27, included repurchase of common shares worth of EUR107 million.Aegon boasts an impressive history of returning shareholder value via share buybacks. Even the COVID--induced market volatilities — having forced most insurers to temporarily halt their share buyback activities — could not prevent AEG from conducting frequent share repurchases.Continued share buybacks underpin the strong financial position of Aegon and its longstanding commitment to rewarding its shareholders with substantial capital. Apart from share buybacks, AEG resorts to annual dividend hikes. The insurer has been a regular dividend-paying company since 2013. The latest raise in the final dividend was proposed during AEG’s fourth-quarter 2021 result announcement.A solid balance sheet and sound growth in free cash flows are expected to have aided Aegon in implementing accelerated and prudent capital-deployment measures. While announcing second-quarter 2022 results, management projected a cumulative free cash flow of minimum EUR2.2 billion over the 2021-2023 period, higher than the EUR1.4-1.6 billion target fixed on the 2020 Capital Markets Day. Increased availability of free cash flows will motivate the insurer to allocate more capital in the days ahead.Story continuesSimilar to Aegon, other insurers like Marsh &amp; McLennan Companies, Inc. MMC, Lincoln National Corporation LNC and RenaissanceRe Holdings Ltd. RNR embraced tactical capital-management moves in the first half fo 2022.Marsh &amp; McLennan bought back 7 million shares worth $1.1 billion. MMC had around $5.2 billion left to be authorized for share buybacks as of Jun 30, 2022. In July 2022, MMC’s board of directors approved a 10% hike in its quarterly dividend.Lincoln National returned $657 million to its shareholders via $500 million of share buybacks and common dividends worth $157 million. As of Jun 30, 2022, LNC had $764 million remaining under its authorized share repurchase program. In November 2021, LNC’s board of directors approved a 7% hike in its quarterly dividend.RenaissanceRe bought back shares worth $137.5 million and paid out common dividends worth $32.4 million in the first half of 2022. RNR had $475.2 million left to be authorized for share buybacks as of Jun 30, 2022. In February 2022, RNR’s board of directors approved a 2.8% hike in the quarterly dividend.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

26,c4f6ea8c-6dde-3c16-97cb-9b70a77f6a4b,HBAN,2022-10-04,"Despite delivering investors losses of 11% over the past 1 year, Huntington Bancshares (NASDAQ:HBAN) has been growing its earnings",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/despite-delivering-investors-losses-11-112144364.html,1664882504,STORY,['HBAN'],"[Huntington Bancshares Incorporated (NASDAQ:HBAN) shareholders should be happy to see the share price up 11% in the last quarter. The stock is actually down over the last year. But it did better than its market, which fell 19%.Although the past week has been more reassuring for shareholders, they're still in the red over the last year, so let's see if the underlying business has been responsible for the decline. View our latest analysis for Huntington Bancshares To paraphrase Benjamin Graham: Over the short term the market is a voting machine, but over the long term it's a weighing machine. One way to examine how market sentiment has changed over time is to look at the interaction between a company's share price and its earnings per share (EPS).During the unfortunate twelve months during which the Huntington Bancshares share price fell, it actually saw its earnings per share (EPS) improve by 19%. It's quite possible that growth expectations may have been unreasonable in the past.It's surprising to see the share price fall so much, despite the improved EPS. So it's well worth checking out some other metrics, too.We don't see any weakness in the Huntington Bancshares' dividend so the steady payout can't really explain the share price drop. The revenue trend doesn't seem to explain why the share price is down. Of course, it could simply be that it simply fell short of the market consensus expectations.The graphic below depicts how earnings and revenue have changed over time (unveil the exact values by clicking on the image).earnings-and-revenue-growthIt's good to see that there was some significant insider buying in the last three months. That's a positive. On the other hand, we think the revenue and earnings trends are much more meaningful measures of the business. So it makes a lot of sense to check out what analysts think Huntington Bancshares will earn in the future (free profit forecasts).What About Dividends?As well as measuring the share price return, investors should also consider the total shareholder return (TSR). Whereas the share price return only reflects the change in the share price, the TSR includes the value of dividends (assuming they were reinvested) and the benefit of any discounted capital raising or spin-off. So for companies that pay a generous dividend, the TSR is often a lot higher than the share price return. As it happens, Huntington Bancshares' TSR for the last 1 year was -11%, which exceeds the share price return mentioned earlier. And there's no prize for guessing that the dividend payments largely explain the divergence!Story continuesA Different PerspectiveAlthough it hurts that Huntington Bancshares returned a loss of 11% in the last twelve months, the broader market was actually worse, returning a loss of 19%. Longer term investors wouldn't be so upset, since they would have made 4%, each year, over five years. It could be that the business is just facing some short term problems, but shareholders should keep a close eye on the fundamentals. Investors who like to make money usually check up on insider purchases, such as the price paid, and total amount bought.

I wonder what Norwegian is saying.BRAD SMITH: Well, all of them are doing this right now too, to try to make it more appealing to customers and trying to re-engage them. With some of the marketing dollars that they may have trimmed, now it's just coming down to policies. Where can you kind of relax some of the policies in order to re-engage with a very loyal fan base that many cruise goers are typically?JULIE HYMAN: Yeah, well, I don't know how that's going to work.

(NYSE: FE), has begun planning a new high-voltage transmission substation that will provide power for the first phase of Quantum Frederick, Quantum Loophole's 2,100-acre data center campus under development in Frederick, Maryland.Potomac Edison Logo (PRNewsfoto/FirstEnergy Corp.)The 230-kilovolt substation will be located near the center of the Quantum Frederick campus and is expected to support the 240 megawatts of power anticipated for its first phase. The substation yard design will accommodate up to 1,000 megawatts in future phases.""Potomac Edison is pleased to be a part of this transformational development project that will generate significant economic benefits for the Frederick community and beyond,"" said Linda Moss, president of FirstEnergy's Maryland operations. ""We have a long history of promoting economic development and helping to attract new jobs to our service area, and we look forward to energizing multiple phases of the Quantum Frederick campus over time.""In support of the project, Potomac Edison plans to reenergize an existing 230-kilovolt transmission line that previously served the property. The company will also install two transformers to convert the high-voltage power from the substation to a lower voltage that can be distributed to Quantum Frederick buildings.The substation is subject to review by regional transmission organization PJM and its stakeholders, and various components of Potomac Edison's planned work are subject to review and approval by Frederick County and the Maryland Public Service Commission.In late June, Quantum Loophole broke ground on critical infrastructure supporting the Quantum Frederick development, which is located at the former Alcoa Eastalco industrial property on Manor Woods Road. The master-planned campus will be connected to the Ashburn, Virginia, data center community by a massive fiber network called QLoop, a 40-mile hyperscale fiber ring capable of supporting more than 200,000 strands of fiber.Story continuesFirstEnergy was recently named by Site Selection magazine as one of the nation's leading utilities in promoting economic development for the fourth year in a row, helping to attract nearly 22,000 new jobs and $5.4 billion in third-party corporate facility investment in its six-state service area in 2021.Potomac Edison serves about 275,000 customers in all or parts of Allegany, Carroll, Frederick, Garrett, Howard, Montgomery, and Washington counties.

Moreover, the cloud-based customer relationship management (CRM) software provider’s sustained focus on acquisitions and partnerships is helping it enhance its product offerings and expand across newer markets.Accelerated Digitalization Driving Salesforce’s Software DemandThe accelerated digital transformation amid the pandemic-induced growing hybrid working trend is spurring demand for Salesforce’s cloud-based solutions. Its ability to provide an integrated solution for customers’ business problems is the key driver.Salesforce’s focus on introducing more aligned products per customer needs is driving its top line. The firm’s products, like Trailhead and myTrailhead, are helping companies through their transformation processes and increasing business scale with modern technology.We believe that accelerated digital transformation will consistently open a huge growth opportunity for Salesforce. As enterprises progress with digital transformation efforts, the use of cloud services is expected to significantly shoot up in the upcoming period.Per Gartner estimates, the spending on public cloud services will grow 20.4% to $494.7 billion in 2022 from $410.9 billion in 2021. Per a Grand View Research report, the global CRM software market is projected to witness a CAGR of 13.3% during the 2022-2030 period. With its SaaS-based CRM and social enterprise applications, we believe Salesforce is well-positioned to lead the market.Acquisitions Expanding Portfolio &amp; Market ReachSalesforce has been strengthening its core competencies by pursuing strategic collaborations and acquisitions. The buyouts of Slack, Tableau, ClickSoftware, Mulesoft, Datorama and CloudCraze over the last couple of years have been significantly beneficial for the company.Story continuesThe Slack acquisition has enhanced Salesforce’s team collaboration software capabilities and added several global customers. Apart from this, the buyout is helping the company better compete with Microsoft MSFT, which is growing as a chief rival with its Dynamics CRM apps.The acquisition of Tableau is in sync with the company’s strategy to diversify beyond customer relationship management and provide more data insights to clients.The acquisition of the tech startup — Vlocity — has helped Salesforce enhance its capabilities and expand its customer base across the communications, media, healthcare, energy, insurance and financial services and entertainment industries.We believe that Salesforce’s sustained focus on expanding its business through strategic acquisitions and investments will fuel growth in the long run.Expanding Globally Through PartnershipsSalesforce's partnership agreements with the likes of Alphabet GOOGL and Amazon AMZN for the firms’ cloud services have been helping it expand its international operations. The company has also entered into an alliance with Apple through which it is offering new apps for iPhones and iPads.Salesforce has also expanded its global strategic alliance with Amazon Web Services (“AWS”) to focus on new product integrations that will simplify secure data sharing and synchronizing across the AWS and Salesforce services.Per the partnership agreement between Salesforce and Alphabet’s Google, the latter offers its G suite licenses to the former’s eligible customers for free for up to a year. The collaboration also integrates Salesforce with Google Analytics, thereby allowing customers to connect sales, marketing and advertising data across both platforms.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

(CRM): Here is What You Need to Know,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/investors-heavily-search-salesforce-inc-130001960.html,1664802001,STORY,['CRM'],"[Salesforce.com (CRM) has been one of the most searched-for stocks on Zacks.com lately. So, you might want to look at some of the facts that could shape the stock's performance in the near term.Shares of this customer-management software developer have returned -6.4% over the past month versus the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's -9.2% change. The Zacks Computer - Software industry, to which Salesforce.com belongs, has lost 11.5% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?While media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.Earnings Estimate RevisionsRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.We essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.For the current quarter, Salesforce.com is expected to post earnings of $1.21 per share, indicating a change of -4.7% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate remained unchanged over the last 30 days.The consensus earnings estimate of $4.72 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of -1.3%. This estimate has remained unchanged over the last 30 days.Story continuesFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $5.56 indicates a change of +17.8% from what Salesforce.com is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -0.5%.With an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for Salesforce.com.The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPS12-month consensus EPS estimate for CRM _12MonthEPSChartUrlRevenue Growth ForecastEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.For Salesforce.com, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $7.82 billion indicates a year-over-year change of +14%. For the current and next fiscal years, $30.94 billion and $35.4 billion estimates indicate +16.8% and +14.4% changes, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistorySalesforce.com reported revenues of $7.72 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +21.8%. EPS of $1.19 for the same period compares with $1.48 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $7.69 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +0.34%. The EPS surprise was +16.67%.The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.ValuationWithout considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.Comparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.As part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.Salesforce.com is graded D on this front, indicating that it is trading at a premium to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.ConclusionThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Salesforce.com. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

The machine learning industry is expected to grow at a compound annual growth rate of 38.8% from 2022 through 2029 and reach a value of $210 billion by the end of 2029.

We invested in the stock in the third quarter of 2019 during a cyclical downturn in the memory industry. Our rationale was that, while the memory industry is cyclical, we believed there are strong secular drivers in place that will lead to higher peaks and long-term growth. Our secular thesis is based on our conviction that the quest for ever-increasing compute speeds will increasingly rely on memory to solve bottlenecks and that increased memory content in nearly everything from mobile phones to automobiles will drive demand. Micron’s stock traded lower during the quarter due to macroeconomic concerns that led to lower earnings expectations. We increased our stake in the company, as we believe our secular thesis remains intact. We wanted to take advantage of what we view as temporary cyclical concerns that caused the stock to trade at less than 10x reasonable trough earnings per share (EPS) estimates and less than 7x recent peak EPS.”7.

But there could be some bright spots ahead. Microsoft may be one of them. That's according to Raymond James, as it resumes its coverage of the tech company with an outperform rating and $300 price target.Let's bring in Andrew Marok. He's Raymond James internet and digital media analyst. Andrew, good to talk to you today. A number of things that you point out in this note, including gaming, cloud, digital ads as well. But talk to me about sort of the top-down view, how you view Microsoft right now in relation to some of its other tech peers.ANDREW MAROK: Great, thank you for having me on today. We do like Microsoft in relation to some of our other tech peers at this point, just because when we look out for things like inflationary pressures, recessionary concerns, and things like that, they tend to bite more harshly on the consumer side of the equation, whereas with an enterprise software company like Microsoft dealing with such a wide product portfolio from productivity software to public cloud to operating systems and beyond, we think that the environment for a company like this with the scale that it has is very advantageous.We cited Gartner's survey recently of a number of chief information officers that suggests that 43% intend to increase their IT spend versus 17% who intend to decrease. And we think that that's a key point in Microsoft's favor that they can consolidate spend in IT if, in the event that even CIOs do potentially feel some pressures, Microsoft's breadth of product offering and reputation should be able to backstop them.AKIKO FUJITA: Yeah, the IT spend number you pointed to from Gartner certainly an interesting one because we have heard that from a lot of these software companies who've said, look, despite the macro slowdown, companies are still transforming or transitioning into the digital space. Why is Microsoft particularly a better bet when you think about all the other software players who are also competing in the enterprise space?Story continuesANDREW MAROK: Sure, and I think, again, it goes back to that breadth and depth of the product offering. Can ease some potential pricing pressures in terms of bundling different aspects of the Microsoft portfolio, and the fact that it's a relatively kind of, quote unquote, ""low risk vendor"" in that the reputation is there, the customer service is there.And it's really kind of built that brand ubiquity over the course of the past couple of decades, where Microsoft is kind of the currency of enterprise IT at this point, whereas if you're more of a single point solution in software, you kind of have to prove yourself in more of a way than Microsoft does.AKIKO FUJITA: And we have seen Microsoft really start to build out the full stack when you think about workplace software, whether that's obviously Windows at its core, or you've got Teams as well. Another thing that I thought was kind of interesting you point out is the advertising side of things for Microsoft. I think a lot of people don't necessarily always think about that with the LinkedIn piece. How big of a revenue driver do you anticipate that to be?ANDREW MAROK: Yeah, and I think that's a great call out both on the advertising and the gaming side. It's a little bit more cyclical in nature maybe than the enterprise IT spend, but we do think that they are very underappreciated growth levers for the overall Microsoft story. Advertising, yes. LinkedIn, a very big component of that, has posted very strong growth. And we still think that there's a lot of user penetration and monetization growth to be seen there.But also with things like the Netflix deal, maybe getting a little bit more into connected television advertising, which is a very strong secular growth market within the digital ad space. Again, things like that just adding more addressable markets for Microsoft to jump into with their scale where they should be able to compete at levels where smaller competitors may find it difficult to invest those levels.AKIKO FUJITA: And finally, Andrew, you point out that this isn't just about Microsoft kind of protecting its moat, trying to win in the spaces they're already in. It is about, as you see it, the company being a little more aggressive, $100 billion in acquisitions over the last five years. What's that next piece do you think Microsoft is going for?ANDREW MAROK: Yeah, absolutely. I think that they have been able to flex their muscle and utilize their scale in terms of gaining footholds into more diverse markets, really pushing forward in gaming. And now with advertising maybe kind of dipping their toe in with the Xandr acquisition around a billion dollars toward the end of last year, I think digital advertising is one to watch.This connected television deal, starting with Netflix, we don't think that it's necessarily a material revenue driver in the immediate term, but it does signal ambition. It's a very large high profile kind of tie-up between the two companies. And I think it does signal that Microsoft is looking at the digital advertising ecosystem as a way to spur another leg of growth over the course of the intermediate term.AKIKO FUJITA: OK, we'll all be watching. Andrew Marok, good to have you on today, Raymond James internet and digital media analyst.]"

However, the favorable job-and-wage growth environment, which supports consumer confidence, and stimulus savings from last year are raising hopes. Predictions also suggest that retail sales will pick up during the holiday season.Per Mastercard SpendingPulse, U.S. retail sales, excluding automotive, are anticipated to surge 7.1% from a year earlier during the traditional holiday period that runs from Nov 1-Dec 24. While in-store retail sales are projected to increase 7.9%, e-commerce is expected to rise 4.2%.Obviously, this is a positive for retail REITs like Realty Income Corporation O, Simon Property Group SPG, Kimco Realty Corporation KIM and Federal Realty Investment Trust FRT.The retail real estate industry is poised to benefit from the pent-up consumer demand as consumers look for an exclusive in-store shopping experience, following the pandemic downtime. Amid these, retailers’ focus has now shifted from the closing of stores to the revival of their growth plans, resulting in more demand for physical store spaces and paving the way for the retail REITs to experience gain in leasing activity, pricing power and flourish.Retailers are also focusing on investments in their stores because apart from serving as showrooms, physical stores offer a convenient location for pick-up or exchange of goods, helping retailers counter the increasing costs associated with last-mile delivery.Furthermore, amid limited availability and with the rapid formation of new businesses in the retail sector, lease signings, rent and occupancies in retail real estates are likely to get a boost. This will support the growth of retail REITs like Realty Income, Simon Property, Kimco Realty, Federal Realty and others.Moreover, omni-channel is the focal point for retailers. Physical stores will be a vital sales channel over the long run because though there is convenience in online shopping, it cannot replace the benefits and satisfaction of visiting a brick-and-mortar store. This is quite evident from the recent foot traffic at retail destinations.Digitally native brands are likely to keep boosting their physical presence in the days to come as part of the omni-channel strategy as the opening of stores helps them improve their connection with customers and drive expansion.In fact, for retailers, the focus now is not only on boosting their online presence but also on maintaining brick-and-mortar stores in the best locations, which in turn is raising hopes for retail REITs that focus on such locations. Also, with the waning impact of the pandemic, entertainment and dining concepts are seeing a revival, boosting retail REIT’s growth scopes.Nevertheless, inflationary pressure, a slowdown in the economy and the depletion of savings might temper consumers’ willingness to spend to some extent. With office usage affected and international tourism yet to regain lost ground, certain submarkets also remain choppy.Moreover, given the convenience of online shopping, it is likely to remain a popular choice among consumers. This is likely to affect the market share for brick-and-mortar stores and hurt demand for retail REIT’s properties.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

It is the first liquidity seeking algorithm powered by Atlas and is designed to maximize non-displayed liquidity capture and minimize price impact.Sonar Dark X leverages Goldman Sachs’ liquidity scoring framework for non-displayed liquidity, including scoring for distinct ATS liquidity segments, to help clients navigate the fragmented landscape. It is the newest algorithm on Atlas, Goldman Sachs’ equities trading platform that was introduced in 2019 as a result of a multi-year investment to evolve the firm’s global trading infrastructure, providing lower latency, higher capacity, and increased agility for product innovation.The new algorithm also uses Goldman Sachs’ Liquidity Shield logic, which is designed to reduce parent order information leakage while seeking invisible liquidity, by balancing the liquidity quality and capture objectives throughout the life of the order by dynamically adjusting among distinct combinations of venue segments, minimum execution quantities and spread allowances.""Global market structure continues to increase in complexity, which requires constant investment in innovation to stay a step ahead,"" says John Cosenza, Head of Electronic Trading in the Americas and Global Co-Head of Product Research and Development at Goldman Sachs. ""Connectivity to a broad set of accessible liquidity venues is now the minimum requirement for liquidity seeking products. In an ever-evolving and increasingly competitive liquidity landscape, the key is to optimize the subset of venue segments best suited for a specific client objective.""Liquidity is fragmented across venues, and many venue operators offer market participants the ability to interact with distinct segments of execution counterparties. This presents a more granular level of trade-off between liquidity quantity and quality across venues and venue segments, resulting in increased client demand for both analysis and advanced navigational tools to execute.Story continuesLeveraging the Atlas platform, the Sonar Dark X algorithm is designed to capture non-displayed liquidity with minimized price impact by identifying opportunities to adjust the pace of liquidity capture based on both price desirability and block availability.The algorithm’s logic is configurable, enabling clients to set order execution parameters, including target participation percentage bands and block allocation amounts across different Execution Styles (Passive, Neutral, and Aggressive). Within such preferences, the algorithm then dynamically manages the relationship between liquidity capture, current stock price and reference price.The new Sonar Dark X algorithm, which has been deployed in the U.S. and is expected to rollout in EMEA later this year, uniquely positions Goldman Sachs to navigate the ever-evolving liquidity landscape.About Goldman SachsThe Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. is a leading global financial institution that delivers a broad range of financial services across investment banking, securities, investment management and consumer banking to a large and diversified client base that includes corporations, financial institutions, governments and individuals.

After the deal is completed, Poshmark would become a standalone US subsidiary of Naver, and it would continue to be led by Chief Executive Officer Manish Chandra and his management team, the companies said.Poshmark climbed 13% at 9:44 a.m. New York time on Tuesday. The stock had lost almost two-thirds of its value since debuting in early 2021 in part due to sluggish growth overseas and increasing competition in the resale market.“I think the market was surprised at the size of the deal,” Naver Chief Executive Officer Choi Soo-Yeon said in an interview, noting that this is the company’s biggest acquisition to date and first foray into Silicon Valley.Naver shares sank 8.8% in Seoul. Citigroup Inc. analysts had earlier downgraded the stock to a sell rating, saying its price-to-earnings ratio was hard to justify when compared to other internet firms.With the transaction, Poshmark will get access to Naver’s extensive e-commerce experience. Naver is one of the leading internet players in South Korea, combining search and cloud services with online shopping. The deal is aimed at creating a global player in online fashion, using the target’s social shopping technology.“Poshmark will become a foothold in the North America market to expand our business in the region,” Choi said. “We will try out our technology through Poshmark’s services popular among the younger generation.”Story continuesNaver obtains a US brand that has grown rapidly in recent years. Poshmark has a community of more than 80 million registered users, across 90% of zip codes in the US, the companies said.Poshmark, which Chandra founded in 2011, is an online marketplace where users post photos of items they are selling and set their own prices, then ship goods once they are purchased. The company, which doesn’t hold any inventory, gets paid when users make a sale.See also: Goodwill launches a resale site featuring Gucci, PradaThe boards of both companies have approved the deal, which is expected to close by the first quarter of 2023, according to the statement.Poshmark’s stock drop since going public isn’t unique among online resellers. Shares of RealReal Inc. are down more than 90% from its 2019 IPO, while ThredUp Inc., which went public two months after Poshmark, has fallen more than 80%.“We don’t think they’ll get a better deal than this,” Wedbush Securities analyst Tom Nikic said of Poshmark in a research note Tuesday. He said RealReal and ThredUp look cheap by comparison and the deal “may have created a ‘floor’ for this beaten-down group.”RealReal climbed 22% in New York trading, while ThredUp rose as much as 19%.LionTree Partners is working as Naver’s financial adviser, while Kirkland &amp; Ellis is acting as Naver’s legal counsel.

He is upgrading Wells Fargo, and downgrading Citigroup. Interesting call here where-- let's get to the Wells Fargo here. It's going to buy from neutral according to him, and the price target is going up to $48 from $46.He says it's an underappreciated earnings growth story because it's got best-in-class revenue upside, it's got efficiency improvement. So pretty interesting here. It also says-- he also says in a recessionary scenario Wells Fargo has less credit risk downside than peers. Basically, because it hasn't been doing as well in loan growth in recent years, so it's got a smaller portfolio.And then on the flip-side, if you look at what he's saying about Citigroup here, he's saying it is more vulnerable in a recessionary scenario, which is really interesting because of the cards in its portfolio, that its card skew he says is the largest percentage of the loan book of any of its peers, which would then cause it to maybe have to you know, take some hits if people are not paying off their credit cards at the same rate or not taking out as much credit card debt in the case of a recession. So pretty interesting call here.BRIAN SOZZI: Yeah. Richard's been covering this industry forever. So I'm hesitant to push back too much, but you don't normally see an upgrade on Wells Fargo. They have been putting up some very difficult quarters. I will note-- call this out too as part of Richard's call on Wells Fargo, ""I see further idiosyncratic expense rationalization."" What does that mean in plain English? Basically, he sees Wells Fargo cutting more expenses to help improve their bottom line in coming quarters.BRAD SMITH: Yeah. And for Wells Fargo, it's been a continuous story over the past three, four years for them to really just get back into good graces with the consumer, with the actual end user of some of the products, the services financially that they offer. And so it's now a broader question of have they done enough to turn a corner and really hold on to some of the momentum that even the analysts of the banks would look at and say, OK, there's possibility for growth here, and so that's a longer-term question. And strategically, there's been a lot of effort from Wells Fargo, it's just this question of is that enough to satisfy the consumer.BRIAN SOZZI: We'll see in a couple of weeks when earnings hit the tape.]"

(NYSE:GS) insiders sold a substantial stake in the company which may have sparked shareholders' attention. Knowing whether insiders are buying is usually more helpful when evaluating insider transactions, as insider selling can have various explanations. However, shareholders should take a deeper look if several insiders are selling stock over a specific time period.While we would never suggest that investors should base their decisions solely on what the directors of a company have been doing, logic dictates you should pay some attention to whether insiders are buying or selling shares. See our latest analysis for Goldman Sachs Group Goldman Sachs Group Insider Transactions Over The Last YearOver the last year, we can see that the biggest insider sale was by the Non-Executive Director, David Viniar, for US$7.0m worth of shares, at about US$411 per share. We generally don't like to see insider selling, but the lower the sale price, the more it concerns us. It's of some comfort that this sale was conducted at a price well above the current share price, which is US$293. So it is hard to draw any strong conclusion from it.Insiders in Goldman Sachs Group didn't buy any shares in the last year. The chart below shows insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last year. By clicking on the graph below, you can see the precise details of each insider transaction!insider-trading-volumeIf you are like me, then you will not want to miss this free list of growing companies that insiders are buying.Insiders At Goldman Sachs Group Have Sold Stock RecentlyOver the last three months, we've seen significant insider selling at Goldman Sachs Group. In total, Global Treasurer Philip Berlinski sold US$2.8m worth of shares in that time, and we didn't record any purchases whatsoever. This may suggest that some insiders think that the shares are not cheap.Insider Ownership Of Goldman Sachs GroupFor a common shareholder, it is worth checking how many shares are held by company insiders. Usually, the higher the insider ownership, the more likely it is that insiders will be incentivised to build the company for the long term. It's great to see that Goldman Sachs Group insiders own 0.5% of the company, worth about US$487m. I like to see this level of insider ownership, because it increases the chances that management are thinking about the best interests of shareholders.Story continuesSo What Does This Data Suggest About Goldman Sachs Group Insiders?An insider sold stock recently, but they haven't been buying. And even if we look at the last year, we didn't see any purchases. The company boasts high insider ownership, but we're a little hesitant, given the history of share sales. So while it's helpful to know what insiders are doing in terms of buying or selling, it's also helpful to know the risks that a particular company is facing.

Boots are somewhat resistant to online competition because they often require specialized fitting. The company has benefited from its economies of scale and multi-channel business model, which have kept revenues flowing during virus-related shutdowns. Stimulus payments by the federal government to consumers have helped as well. Boot Barn’s private-label brands, built around well-known personalities in the music business, have enabled the company to convert higher portions of its revenues into bottom-line profits. For most of the period since March 2020, Boot Barn’s stock rallied on these positive conditions—and this rally continued in the fourth quarter. We consider Boot Barn’s management to be excellent, and we’ve continually added to our position on periodic price weakness within the context of an overall upward trajectory in the stock.”9.

The company generates revenue by charging a per-ticket fee on paid tickets and has a strong foothold in the small-and-mid markets—nearly 20X the size of the next largest competitor. We believe Eventbrite is well-positioned to benefit from a sharp increase in demand for live events amid the broader re-opening of the US economy—a dynamic it has already witnessed in Australia with live events bouncing back to approximately 90% of 2019 levels. We expect this to be amplified by significant cost cuts made during the pandemic (&gt;30% of 2019 revenue) remaining in place. Longer term, we believe Eventbrite should benefit from the secular trend toward consumer experiences, an industry growing over 8% per year prior to the pandemic.”   Click to continue reading and see 5 Stocks to Buy According to Richard Scott Greeder's Broad Bay Capital.  Suggested articles:Best Dividend Stocks Under $5015 Biggest Asset Management Companies11 Best Cruise Stocks To Buy Now Disclosure: None. 10 Stocks to Buy According to Richard Scott Greeder's Broad Bay Capital is originally published on Insider Monkey.]"

While its anti-inflammatory drug Humira continues to be a key revenue driver of the company’s sales, it is set to lose exclusivity in the United States next year.AbbVie’s flagship product, Humira, is approved in the United States and Europe for several autoimmune diseases like rheumatoid arthritis (RA), active psoriatic arthritis, active ankylosing spondylitis and Crohn’s disease (CD). The drug accounted for nearly 37% of total 2021 revenues.In the international markets, AbbVie is already facing direct biosimilar competition in Europe and other countries, resulting in a loss of product revenue. In the first half of 2022, international sales of the drug declined 18.6%. International sales were affected by the launch of several direct biosimilar drugs in Europe by other pharma companies, including Amgen AMGN, Sandoz and Biogen BIIB.Companies like Amgen, Sandoz and Biogen were the first to start commercializing a Humira-biosimilar in Europe in 2018. Amgen, Biogen, Boehringer Ingelheim, Pfizer, Sandoz and many other companies also received FDA approvals for a Humira-biosimilar but commercialization is expected to start after the loss of exclusivity for Humira in the U.S.To prepare for the loss in Humira sales due to patent exclusivity, AbbVie has developed and is presently marketing its newest immunology drugs, Skyrizi (risankizumab) and Rinvoq (upadacitinib), which position it well for long-term growth.Rinvoq is approved for five indications in the United States and Europe — RA, psoriatic arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, atopic dermatitis and ulcerative colitis. Skyrizi is approved in the United States and Europe for two indications – plaque psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis. Skyrizi is also approved in the United States for a third indication, i.e., CD, while a regulatory filing is under review in Europe seeking approval for Skyrizi in CD and a decision is expected by year-end.Story continuesSkyrizi and Rinvoq have demonstrated differentiated clinical profiles versus Humira and are already contributing meaningful revenues. Rinvoq and Skyrizi combined have generated $4.6 billion in combined sales in 2021 and $3.25 billion in the first half of 2022.This strength in revenue is mainly driven by approvals of the drugs in new indications. With these approvals, sales of these drugs could be higher in 2023/2024 and potentially to replace Humira when generics are launched in the United States in 2023. AbbVie expects combined sales of Skyrizi and Rinvoq to be more than $15 billion by 2025.Apart from immunology franchise, AbbVie also enjoys leadership positions in other key therapeutic areas, including hematologic oncology, neuroscience, aesthetics and eye care.AbbVie believes that oncology will be its major growth driver over the next 10 years. AbbVie has built a substantial oncology franchise with Imbruvica (hematological cancers) and Venclexta (hematological malignancies), which generated nearly $7.2 billion in 2021 and $3.3 billion in first-half 2022.AbbVie developed Imbruvica in partnership with Johnson &amp; Johnson JNJ. Per the terms of the partnership, J&amp;J has exclusive license to market the drug outside the United States. The company shares international profits earned from Imbruvica with J&amp;J. Both ABBV and J&amp;J co-exclusively market the drug in the United StatesThe U.S. sales of Imbruvica are being hurt by lower new patient starts in CLL due to delayed recovery from the pandemic and increasing competition from newer therapies. However, sales are expected to recover in subsequent future quarters as the pandemic is now officially over in the country.AbbVie also has an exciting and diverse pipeline of promising new therapies in both blood cancers and solid tumors like navitoclax for myelofibrosis, epcoritamab, a CD3xCD20 bispecific, across several B-cell malignancies including diffuse B cell and follicular lymphomas, ABBV-383, a BCMA CD3 bispecific, being studied for multiple myeloma and Teliso-V, a promising c-Met ADC being studied for non-squamous non-small cell lung cancer. AbbVie expects to submit regulatory applications in 2022 for accelerated approval of epcoritamab in patients with relapsed/refractory large B-cell lymphoma.Other key drugs include Botox Cosmetic (aesthetic use), Juvederm, Botox Therapeutics (neuroscience indications) and Vraylar (schizophrenia and bipolar I disorder), each of which is a driver of sales for the company. The company added Botox to its list following the acquisition of Allergan in 2020. AbbVie’s rationale behind the Allergan deal was to add a new blockbuster product like Botox to its portfolio, ahead of generic competition for Humira.The company has also launched new migraine drugs, Ubrelvy and Qulipta, with each drug representing a $1 billion-plus peak sales opportunity.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

The southern Brazilian port of Paranagua is where most of the deliverable sugar will be loaded into vessels, a total of nearly 560,000 tonnes. The rest will be loaded at the Santos port, Brazil's largest.The traders said on Friday that Louis Dreyfus was the leading deliverer with around 435,000 tonnes, while Asian commodities trader Wilmar International was seen as the largest receiver with 567,000 tonnes.Last year, the October delivery was much smaller at only 4,445 lots, but in 2020 it was an all-time record at 51,597 lots.""Now whether the delivery is bullish or bearish is always the question, but what is also important beyond the size is the timing.

106,58e3bdf0-88d0-35c0-9278-dae429d29277,GD,2022-10-04,General Dynamics Corporation's (NYSE:GD) Has Had A Decent Run On The Stock market: Are Fundamentals In The Driver's Seat?,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/general-dynamics-corporations-nyse-gd-110012964.html,1664881212,STORY,['GD'],"[Most readers would already know that General Dynamics' (NYSE:GD) stock increased by 2.8% over the past three months. Given that stock prices are usually aligned with a company's financial performance in the long-term, we decided to investigate if the company's decent financials had a hand to play in the recent price move. Specifically, we decided to study General Dynamics'  ROE in this article.Return on equity or ROE is a key measure used to assess how efficiently a company's management is utilizing the company's capital. In other words, it is a profitability ratio which measures the rate of return on the capital provided by the company's shareholders. See our latest analysis for General Dynamics How Do You Calculate Return On Equity?ROE can be calculated by using the formula:Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' EquitySo, based on the above formula, the ROE for General Dynamics is:19% = US$3.3b ÷ US$17b (Based on the trailing twelve months to July 2022).The 'return' is the profit over the last twelve months. So, this means that for every $1 of its shareholder's investments, the company generates a profit of $0.19.What Is The Relationship Between ROE And Earnings Growth?We have already established that ROE serves as an efficient profit-generating gauge for a company's future earnings. Based on how much of its profits the company chooses to reinvest or ""retain"", we are then able to evaluate a company's future ability to generate profits. Assuming everything else remains unchanged, the higher the ROE and profit retention, the higher the growth rate of a company compared to companies that don't necessarily bear these characteristics.General Dynamics' Earnings Growth And 19% ROETo begin with, General Dynamics seems to have a respectable ROE. On comparing with the average industry ROE of 10% the company's ROE looks pretty remarkable. However, for some reason, the higher returns aren't reflected in General Dynamics' meagre five year net income growth average of 2.4%. That's a bit unexpected from a company which has such a high rate of return. A few likely reasons why this could happen is that the company could have a high payout ratio or the business has allocated capital poorly, for instance.Story continuesWe then compared General Dynamics' net income growth with the industry and found that the company's growth figure is lower than the average industry growth rate of 4.0% in the same period, which is a bit concerning.past-earnings-growthEarnings growth is a huge factor in stock valuation. The investor should try to establish if the expected growth or decline in earnings, whichever the case may be, is priced in. This then helps them determine if the stock is placed for a bright or bleak future. One good indicator of expected earnings growth is the P/E ratio which determines the price the market is willing to pay for a stock based on its earnings prospects. So, you may want to check if General Dynamics is trading on a high P/E or a low P/E, relative to its industry.Is General Dynamics Using Its Retained Earnings Effectively?Despite having a normal three-year median payout ratio of 40% (or a retention ratio of 60% over the past three years, General Dynamics has seen very little growth in earnings as we saw above. Therefore, there might be some other reasons to explain the lack in that respect. For example, the business could be in decline.Additionally, General Dynamics has paid dividends over a period of at least ten years, which means that the company's management is determined to pay dividends even if it means little to no earnings growth. Based on the latest analysts' estimates, we found that the company's future payout ratio over the next three years is expected to hold steady at 38%. As a result, General Dynamics' ROE is not expected to change by much either, which we inferred from the analyst estimate of 21% for future ROE.SummaryOverall, we feel that General Dynamics certainly does have some positive factors to consider. Although, we are disappointed to see a lack of growth in earnings even in spite of a high ROE and and a high reinvestment rate. We believe that there might be some outside factors that could be having a negative impact on the business. Having said that, looking at the current analyst estimates, we found that the company's earnings are expected to gain momentum. Are these analysts expectations based on the broad expectations for the industry, or on the company's fundamentals?

Sterling has risen by more than 10% since the mini-budget unveiled by Finance Minister Kwasi Kwarteng last week triggered alarm across the financial markets.Global bond yields headed lower, with those on the benchmark U.S. 10-year Treasury note falling 6 basis points to 3.587%. The yield fell by nearly 20 basis points on Monday, having topped 4.0% just last week.Story continues""Noticeably, that move lower was entirely driven by a fall in real yields, with inflation breakevens moving higher on the day, which is again a sign that investors are pricing in a much less aggressive reaction from the Fed,"" Deutsche Bank strategist Jim Reid said in a daily note.DOLLAR RELAXES ITS GRIPWith Treasury yields falling, the dollar was on course for a fifth consecutive daily loss against a basket of currencies - its longest streak of declines since August 2021 - as investors began to price in the possibility that tighter credit conditions will make the Federal Reserve tread more carefully.However, some analysts said this optimism may be misplaced.""My firm view, however, is that this will not be the case. While, technically, having a dual mandate, the Fed have effectively become a single-issue central bank; that issue being bringing inflation back to the 2% target,"" Michael Brown, chief strategist at CaxtonFX, said.""Unless we see a few months of consecutive improvement in inflation data, it's tough to envisage any sort of pivot, with another 75 bps hike remaining my base case for next month's decision. It's tough to be long risk with that on the radar.""Markets show investors believe inflation is likely to drop more quickly. On a five-year horizon, investors see inflation at just 2.24%, down from nearer 3% six weeks ago.In Europe, benchmark natural gas prices, which have served as a proxy for inflation, fell to their lowest in two months, which could take some pressure off the European Central Bank.In the UK, Kwarteng on Monday announced the government would back down on a tax cut for top earners that formed part of a package aimed at boosting growth.This measure only makes up a small part of the 45 billion pounds ($51 billion) in unfunded tax cuts, but it was enough to soothe some of the recent angst in the market and, together with emergency bond buying from the Bank of England, sterling was set to make up most of the losses incurred since the mini budget was unveiled on Sept. 23.But the respite seen across the markets on Monday and Tuesday would likely not last, given the bleak outlook for the British economy, analysts said.""The about-face ... will not have a huge impact on the overall UK fiscal situation in our view,"" said NatWest Markets' head of economics and markets strategy John Briggs.""(But) investors took it as a signal that the UK government could and is at least partially willing to walk back from its intentions that so disrupted markets over the past week.""S&amp;P 500 futures rose 1.8%, following a 2.6% bounce for the index overnight, suggesting a second day of gains may be in the offing on Wall Street later.Oil rallied for a second day, boosted by the prospect of output cuts from the world's biggest exporters, leaving Brent futures up 1.1% at $89.84 a barrel.($1 = 0.8827 pounds)(Additional reporting by Tom Westbrook in Sydney; Editing by David Evans and Mark Potter)]"

""It transforms the ban from an absolute ban to a conditional ban."" (Reporting By Julia Payne; Writing by Noah Browning; Editing by Andrew Heavens and Barbara Lewis)]"

Starting with BNY Mellon Natural Resources A (DNLAX) is one possibility. DNLAX holds a Zacks Mutual Fund Rank of 1 (Strong Buy), which is based on nine forecasting factors like size, cost, and past performance.History of Fund/ManagerDNLAX finds itself in the BNY Mellon family, based out of New York, NY. BNY Mellon Natural Resources A debuted in October of 2003. Since then, DNLAX has accumulated assets of about $185.78 million, according to the most recently available information. The fund's current manager, Albert Chu, has been in charge of the fund since October of 2019.PerformanceObviously, what investors are looking for in these funds is strong performance relative to their peers. This fund has delivered a 5-year annualized total return of 15.35%, and it sits in the top third among its category peers. But if you are looking for a shorter time frame, it is also worth looking at its 3-year annualized total return of 28.22%, which places it in the top third during this time-frame.When looking at a fund's performance, it is also important to note the standard deviation of the returns. The lower the standard deviation, the less volatility the fund experiences. Over the past three years, DNLAX's standard deviation comes in at 29.69%, compared to the category average of 18.9%. Looking at the past 5 years, the fund's standard deviation is 26.14% compared to the category average of 16.96%. This makes the fund more volatile than its peers over the past half-decade.Risk FactorsInvestors should not forget about beta, an important way to measure a mutual fund's risk compared to the market as a whole. DNLAX has a 5-year beta of 1.06, which means it is likely to be more volatile than the market average. Another factor to consider is alpha, as it reflects a portfolio's performance on a risk-adjusted basis relative to a benchmark-in this case, the S&amp;P 500. Over the past 5 years, the fund has a positive alpha of 4.43. This means that managers in this portfolio are skilled in picking securities that generate better-than-benchmark returns.Story continuesExpensesCosts are increasingly important for mutual fund investing, and particularly as competition heats up in this market. And all things being equal, a lower cost product will outperform its otherwise identical counterpart, so taking a closer look at these metrics is key for investors. In terms of fees, DNLAX is a load fund. It has an expense ratio of 1.13% compared to the category average of 1.46%. DNLAX is actually cheaper than its peers when you consider factors like cost.Investors need to be aware that with this product, the minimum initial investment is $1,000; each subsequent investment needs to be at least $100.Bottom LineOverall, BNY Mellon Natural Resources A ( DNLAX ) has a high Zacks Mutual Fund rank, and in conjunction with its comparatively strong performance, worse downside risk, and lower fees, BNY Mellon Natural Resources A ( DNLAX ) looks like a good potential choice for investors right now.Want even more information about DNLAX?

The Arkansas-based company recently faced pressure from Walmart, one of its major distributors, to curb emissions. Tyson achieved that by pushing its own suppliers to rein in greenhouse gases. (Michael Conroy / Associated Press)The Inflation Reduction Act is both the most important federal climate legislation ever and sadly inadequate to protect the U.S. and the world from the effects of climate change. Where it falls short, states could intervene with tougher regulations — but many won’t. That leaves corporations, which can pressure their suppliers to take the actions necessary to prevent global warming’s most devastating effects.Several expert assessments agree that the IRA will reduce U.S. greenhouse gas emissions by up to a billion tons per year by 2030.If fully realized, the IRA’s policies get us one-third of the way to a safe and stable climate, one that avoids global warming beyond two degrees Celsius above the preindustrial average. Where will the other two-thirds of emissions reductions come from?Between the Senate filibuster and the Supreme Court’s restrictive ruling in West Virginia vs. Environmental Protection Agency, it’s unlikely that major new federal legislation or regulations with carbon limits will emerge. State governments could act, but half of U.S. emissions come from states that are indifferent or hostile to reducing their emissions.A surprising ray of hope emerges from a new study showing that global supply chain contracting networks could play a role in climate change response. Corporations can require each supplier to cut emissions in order to continue doing business with them.According to CDP International, a nonprofit that manages corporate emissions disclosures, the average corporation’s supply chain is responsible for 11 times more emissions than the company itself, making the contracts that govern supply chains a powerful tool for climate mitigation. CDP’s analysis finds that existing supply chain contract requirements by 200 major corporations have induced almost 24,000 companies to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions. The result: Companies are rapidly cutting emissions from their supply chains, with 1.8 billion tons cut in 2021 alone.Story continuesIn comparison, the IRA is not expected to reach emissions reductions of 1 billion tons per year until 2030. Supply chain contracting is already doing more to reduce emissions than the IRA will eight years from now.Large companies such as Facebook, Google and Amazon have driven rapid growth of renewable energy, even in states with few climate change regulations. For instance, companies are imposing supply chain requirements on suppliers in the South, the region that has led the state-level resistance to climate change mitigation but has emissions roughly equal to those of Germany, the sixth- or seventh-highest-emitting country.Walmart, the largest retailer in the world, with thousands of suppliers, has worked with the Environmental Defense Fund and other environmental groups on Project Gigaton, which aims to eliminate a billion tons of carbon emissions from Walmart’s supply chain between 2017 and 2030. That would have the same impact as Germany becoming carbon neutral a year ahead of schedule.Facing pressure as a leading Walmart supplier, Tyson Foods recently worked with the Environmental Defense Fund to reduce carbon emissions from its own suppliers — and that’s how the “chain” comes into play. Tyson was recognized as one of Walmart’s 1,029 ""Giga Gurus,"" a group of suppliers that agree to set carbon emissions goals, share them publicly, and report avoided emissions in the last year — the same types of action that a government regulatory program would require.Ingersoll Rand, based in North Carolina, responded to pressure from its corporate customers by developing more sustainable transport options. Kimberly-Clark, the Texas-based maker of Huggies and dozens of other everyday products, is pushing its timber suppliers in Alabama and Mississippi to improve climate-related forestry practices. Missouri-based beer giant Anheuser-Busch has committed to powering its U.S. brewing and production facilities with renewable power — and it has developed a program to encourage decarbonization by its suppliers and its suppliers’ suppliers. Politics doesn’t have to get involved. Many of these corporations are hardly known for being progressive.Private-sector initiatives have the potential to step in where government has failed to curb emissions and also reduce the partisan gridlock behind those failures. Most people in the U.S., including a majority of Democrats, think big government is a greater threat to the nation than big business, and this mistrust reduces support for climate policy. Learning about nongovernmental responses to climate change can boost conservatives’ and moderates’ trust in climate science and support for government action.Of course, we shouldn’t fall into the common trap of the “panacea bias,” which leads people to consider only actions or policies that single-handedly solve complex problems. Such policies don’t exist for a problem as large as climate change.Rather, we must address large, messy problems with as many smaller actions as possible: some by the federal government, some by state or local governments, some by private businesses or other organizations.The Inflation Reduction Act is an important step for climate policy in the United States, and it will do a great deal to help our nation meet its climate goals. But it will not hit those targets on its own. Private-sector actions, such as environmental supply chain contracting, can fill the gaps that remain to secure a more stable climate.Michael P. Vandenbergh is a professor of law at Vanderbilt University and director of its Climate Change Research Network. Jonathan M.

We've got a twofer with Qualcomm and Apple, Blue Apron and [? Take ?] [? Two. ?] Now we'll kick us off with Apple and Qualcomm. Apple's patent dispute with chipmaker Qualcomm was dealt a blow in the Supreme Court today. Now the court again refusing to hear Apple's bid to cancel three Qualcomm smartphone patents. Now this follows a similar decision in June involving two other related Qualcomm patents. Now, this standoff is part of a broader dispute that's been going on since 2017, when Qualcomm accused Apple of infringing on tech used in its iPhones, iPads, and its watches.Now the multibillion settlement resulting from that in 2019 did include a license for Apple to keep using Qualcomm chips in iPhones, but it also left questions, as that license is going to expire in 2025. And Apple is afraid that it's going to get sued again at that point. The courts, though, not convinced, and clearly, investors not worried about it either based on the stock moves we're seeing today, especially as Apple continues the brisk pace of developing its own chips to rival Qualcomm. So both stocks doing well today. Clearly not that worried, Seana.- Yeah, they're not that worried. The move today, also, of course, comes as a broader market rally too. But when it comes to Apple and Qualcomm, this saga has been going on for five years. So the ruling we got today upheld the previous ruling. Like you said, the next test could be in a few years when that patent does run out in 2025-- or 2024, excuse me. That could potentially bring these two back into going head-to-head. But at least for right now, some of that tension does seem to subside. But we'll see whether or not Qualcomm decides to challenge Apple.]"

That case was part of a broader global dispute between the tech giants.Apple challenged the validity of the patents at issue in this case at the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office's Patent Trial and Appeal Board.The companies settled their underlying fight in 2019, signing an agreement worth billions of dollars that let Apple continue using Qualcomm chips in iPhones. The settlement included an Apple license to thousands of Qualcomm patents, but allowed the patent-board proceedings to continue.The board upheld the patents in 2020, and Apple appealed to the patent-specialist U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit. Cupertino, California-based Apple argued it had proper legal standing to appeal because San Diego-based Qualcomm could sue again after the license expires, potentially as soon as 2025.A Federal Circuit three-judge panel, in a 2-1 ruling, dismissed the case last year for a lack of standing, finding that Apple's risk of being sued again was speculative and the challenge would not affect its payment obligations under the settlement.Qualcomm has again argued that Apple has not shown a concrete injury to justify the appeal, just like in the ""materially identical"" case that the high court rejected.(Reporting by Blake Brittain; Editing by Will Dunham)]"

However, CNN Travel expects a meaningfully smoother sail for cruises ahead. According to the top global cruise industry trade group, Cruise Lines International Association (CLIA), over 75% of its member ships have resumed their services, with almost all of its cruise ships expected to be sailing by late summer.CLIA projects passenger metrics to surpass the pre-pandemic levels by the end of 2023. Similarly, according to Cruise Industry News, about 40 new ships are expected to hit the market this year, and more than 75 vessels have already been ordered through 2027. In late April, Colleen McDaniel, editor-in-chief of leading cruise review website Cruise Critic, said: ""We're seeing shoppers and cruise bookings increase week after week, which is fantastic news for the industry.""In November 2021, CLIA's member cruise lines announced that they will become carbon neutral by 2050, in line with the United Nations' net-zero global emissions goal. In order to achieve zero carbon, the cruise industry is gradually moving towards reducing emissions via shore-power connectivity, which means enabling ships to switch off their engines and plug in at ports. CLIA will have 174 ships with shore-power connectivity by 2027, however, only about 14 global ports presently provide the connectivity infrastructure. The demand in the cruise sector can potentially weather the inflationary headwinds, and investors who would like to get in on the action can buy stocks like Marriott International, Inc. (NASDAQ:MAR), Expedia Group, Inc. (NASDAQ:EXPE), and Booking Holdings Inc.

The award has been offered by the Naval Supply Systems Command Weapon Systems Support, Philadelphia, PA.Details of the DealValued at $191.8 million, the contract is expected to be completed by July 2025. Per the terms of the deal, Boeing will be engaged in the repair of multiple flight control surfaces used on the F/A-18E/F and E/A-18G aircraft.The majority of the work related to this deal will be carried out in Jacksonville, FL.What’s Favoring Boeing?Boeing, one of the major players in the defense business, stands out among its peers by virtue of its broadly diversified programs, strong order bookings and solid backlog. Furthermore, the company's expertise lies in a wide variety of aircraft components, repairs and modification-related programs.Notably, its Defense, Space &amp; Security segment’s portfolio has fixed-wing military aircraft, including F/A-18E/F Super Hornet, F-15 programs, P-8 programs, KC-46A Tanker and T-7A Red Hawk.  Boeing's combat-proven aerospace programs and associated services, along with the rapidly growing need for military aircraft due to heightened geopolitical uncertainties worldwide, result in a solid inflow of orders from the Pentagon. The latest contract win is an example of that. Such order flows, in turn, should boost the top line of the defense business segment.Growth ProspectsWith rising security threats across the globe, emerging economies like the Asia Pacific, the Middle East and South America are spending a lot on enhancing their defense arsenals. Meanwhile, developed nations like the United States and Europe have already been leading the defense market. With the United States being the largest worldwide weapons exporter, the nation has been spending amply on defense products. Boeing, the largest aircraft manufacturer in the United States, thus enjoys a dominant position in the combat aircraft market.Per a Mordor Intelligence report, the global combat aircraft market is expected to witness a CAGR of 2.5% during the 2021-2026 time period, with North America constituting the largest share of this market. Such growth can be attributed to a rise in global threats and geopolitical instabilities and increased spending on defense. These projections should benefit Boeing along with other U.S.-based combat jet manufacturers like Northrop Grumman NOC, Lockheed Martin LMT and Textron TXT.Story continuesSince its inception, Northrop Grumman has been a pioneer in the development of manned aircraft for combat. Northrop Grumman also has a tradition of providing technological leadership in all aspects of military aviation and aircraft, such as manned, unmanned, targeting, surveillance, and aircraft self-protection systems that enable warfighters to accomplish missions anytime and anywhere, under any conditions.Its Aeronautics Systems unit is engaged in the design, development, production, integration, sustainment and modernization of advanced aircraft systems, whereas its Mission Systems segment offers advanced mission solutions and multifunction systems like Airborne Early Warning &amp; Control (AEW&amp;C), LONGBOW Fire Control Radar (FCR) and Scalable Agile Beam Radar (SABR).Lockheed’s Aeronautics business segment is engaged in the research, design, development, manufacture, integration, sustainment, support and upgrade of advanced military aircraft, including combat and air mobility aircraft, unmanned air vehicles and related technologies. Its major programs include F-35, C-130 Hercules, F-16 Fighting Falcon and F-22 Raptor jets.Moreover, its Missiles and Fire Control segment offers varied air defense solutions like its Joint Air-to-Surface Standoff Missile (JASSM) tactical missile program, an air-to-ground missile launched from fixed-wing aircraft. Hellfire is another air-to-ground missile, which is manufactured by Lockheed and used on rotary and fixed-wing aircraft.Textron’s business unit, Textron Aviation Defense, designs, builds and supports versatile and globally-known military aircraft, preferred for training and attack missions. Textron Aviation’s military trainer and defense aircraft include the T-6 trainer, which has been used to train pilots from more than 20 countries, and the AT-6 light attack military aircraft.Moreover, its subsidiary, Able Aerospace Services provides component and maintenance, repair and overhaul services in support of commercial and military fixed- and rotor-wing aircraft.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

However, the market is not giving the company credit for the material improvements CEO Larry Culp has made in his tenure. The balance sheet today is stronger than it has been in a very long time, and each of the three primary business segments each have strong paths to increasing earnings, regardless of the economic environment. Healthcare has historically not been a cyclical business. While Aviation typically has some economic sensitivity, the business still has a strong COVID rebound tailwind that should continue even in an uncertain environment. Power is a less cyclical business, and GE maintains a steady business servicing approximately one-third of the world’s electricity. GE is another example of strong insider buying indicating management’s confidence in the business, while the company also began buying back discounted shares. GE is still on track to break the company into three separate businesses, and we believe this will help the market properly weigh the value of each core segment.”8.

While its anti-inflammatory drug Humira continues to be a key revenue driver of the company’s sales, it is set to lose exclusivity in the United States next year.AbbVie’s flagship product, Humira, is approved in the United States and Europe for several autoimmune diseases like rheumatoid arthritis (RA), active psoriatic arthritis, active ankylosing spondylitis and Crohn’s disease (CD). The drug accounted for nearly 37% of total 2021 revenues.In the international markets, AbbVie is already facing direct biosimilar competition in Europe and other countries, resulting in a loss of product revenue. In the first half of 2022, international sales of the drug declined 18.6%. International sales were affected by the launch of several direct biosimilar drugs in Europe by other pharma companies, including Amgen AMGN, Sandoz and Biogen BIIB.Companies like Amgen, Sandoz and Biogen were the first to start commercializing a Humira-biosimilar in Europe in 2018. Amgen, Biogen, Boehringer Ingelheim, Pfizer, Sandoz and many other companies also received FDA approvals for a Humira-biosimilar but commercialization is expected to start after the loss of exclusivity for Humira in the U.S.To prepare for the loss in Humira sales due to patent exclusivity, AbbVie has developed and is presently marketing its newest immunology drugs, Skyrizi (risankizumab) and Rinvoq (upadacitinib), which position it well for long-term growth.Rinvoq is approved for five indications in the United States and Europe — RA, psoriatic arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, atopic dermatitis and ulcerative colitis. Skyrizi is approved in the United States and Europe for two indications – plaque psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis. Skyrizi is also approved in the United States for a third indication, i.e., CD, while a regulatory filing is under review in Europe seeking approval for Skyrizi in CD and a decision is expected by year-end.Story continuesSkyrizi and Rinvoq have demonstrated differentiated clinical profiles versus Humira and are already contributing meaningful revenues. Rinvoq and Skyrizi combined have generated $4.6 billion in combined sales in 2021 and $3.25 billion in the first half of 2022.This strength in revenue is mainly driven by approvals of the drugs in new indications. With these approvals, sales of these drugs could be higher in 2023/2024 and potentially to replace Humira when generics are launched in the United States in 2023. AbbVie expects combined sales of Skyrizi and Rinvoq to be more than $15 billion by 2025.Apart from immunology franchise, AbbVie also enjoys leadership positions in other key therapeutic areas, including hematologic oncology, neuroscience, aesthetics and eye care.AbbVie believes that oncology will be its major growth driver over the next 10 years. AbbVie has built a substantial oncology franchise with Imbruvica (hematological cancers) and Venclexta (hematological malignancies), which generated nearly $7.2 billion in 2021 and $3.3 billion in first-half 2022.AbbVie developed Imbruvica in partnership with Johnson &amp; Johnson JNJ. Per the terms of the partnership, J&amp;J has exclusive license to market the drug outside the United States. The company shares international profits earned from Imbruvica with J&amp;J. Both ABBV and J&amp;J co-exclusively market the drug in the United StatesThe U.S. sales of Imbruvica are being hurt by lower new patient starts in CLL due to delayed recovery from the pandemic and increasing competition from newer therapies. However, sales are expected to recover in subsequent future quarters as the pandemic is now officially over in the country.AbbVie also has an exciting and diverse pipeline of promising new therapies in both blood cancers and solid tumors like navitoclax for myelofibrosis, epcoritamab, a CD3xCD20 bispecific, across several B-cell malignancies including diffuse B cell and follicular lymphomas, ABBV-383, a BCMA CD3 bispecific, being studied for multiple myeloma and Teliso-V, a promising c-Met ADC being studied for non-squamous non-small cell lung cancer. AbbVie expects to submit regulatory applications in 2022 for accelerated approval of epcoritamab in patients with relapsed/refractory large B-cell lymphoma.Other key drugs include Botox Cosmetic (aesthetic use), Juvederm, Botox Therapeutics (neuroscience indications) and Vraylar (schizophrenia and bipolar I disorder), each of which is a driver of sales for the company. The company added Botox to its list following the acquisition of Allergan in 2020. AbbVie’s rationale behind the Allergan deal was to add a new blockbuster product like Botox to its portfolio, ahead of generic competition for Humira.The company has also launched new migraine drugs, Ubrelvy and Qulipta, with each drug representing a $1 billion-plus peak sales opportunity.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

This is likely to drive CCI’s site rental revenue growth in the upcoming period.Also, with the increased innovation and adoption of data-driven mobile devices and applications, such as machine-to-machine connections, social networking and streaming of video, wireless data consumption are expected to escalate considerably in the future.To capitalize on this upbeat trend, Crown Castle has been increasingly investing in new small cell and fiber assets to enhance the network density required for its customers’ wireless networks. CCI expects to double the rate of small cell deployments next year compared with the 5,000 nodes it anticipates putting on air in 2022.On the balance-sheet front, Crown Castle exited second-quarter 2022 with cash and cash equivalents of $281 million. Moreover, in July 2022, CCI increased the commitments under its senior unsecured revolving credit facility by $2.0 billion to $7.0 billion. Such moves boost its financial flexibility.With investment-grade credit ratings of BBB-, BBB+ and Baa3 from Standard &amp; Poor’s, Fitch, and Moody’s, respectively, and enough financial flexibility, CCI is well-poised to capitalize on future growth opportunities.In addition, its trailing 12-month return on equity (ROE) is 18.93% compared with the industry’s average of 3.76%. This reflects that the company is more efficient in using shareholders’ funds than its peers.However, Crown Castle has a high customer concentration, with T-Mobile TMUS, AT&amp;T T and Verizon VZ accounting for around three-fourths of the company’s site rental revenues. Notably, for the six months ended Jun 30, 2022, T-Mobile, AT&amp;T and Verizon accounted for 37%, 19% and 19%, respectively, of CCI’s site rental revenues.Therefore, the loss of any of these customers, consolidation among them or a reduction in network spending might hurt the company’s top line significantly.Crown Castle has a substantially leveraged balance sheet with a significant amount of debt relative to its cash flows, which is concerning.Also, a hike in interest rates is likely to increase borrowing costs, affecting its ability to purchase or develop real estate.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

In the second quarter of 2022, dividends and buybacks accounted for 89.2% of the operating earnings of the S&amp;P 500, as reported by Yardeni Research, Inc.Historically, dividend stocks have delivered strong returns during periods of high inflation. Especially the companies with strong dividend growth histories proved to be real winners and returned strong capital to shareholders. According to a report by Sterling Capital, dividend growers delivered an annual average return of 10.4% from January 1973 to December 1984 and non-dividend paying stocks returned 5.1% in comparison. Overall, dividend stocks returned 9.5% during this period. Some of the best dividend stocks like PepsiCo, Inc. (NASDAQ:PEP), Merck &amp; Co., Inc.

However, the market is not giving the company credit for the material improvements CEO Larry Culp has made in his tenure. The balance sheet today is stronger than it has been in a very long time, and each of the three primary business segments each have strong paths to increasing earnings, regardless of the economic environment. Healthcare has historically not been a cyclical business. While Aviation typically has some economic sensitivity, the business still has a strong COVID rebound tailwind that should continue even in an uncertain environment. Power is a less cyclical business, and GE maintains a steady business servicing approximately one-third of the world’s electricity. GE is another example of strong insider buying indicating management’s confidence in the business, while the company also began buying back discounted shares. GE is still on track to break the company into three separate businesses, and we believe this will help the market properly weigh the value of each core segment.”8.

As expected, the performance of blood thinner drug Eliquis and immuno-oncology drug Opdivo, along with encouraging pipeline progress, has maintained momentum.But what has impressed the investors most is the recent string of new drug approvals, which paved the way for an incremental stream of revenues.  The FDA recently approved its experimental candidate deucravacitinib to treat adults with moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis who are candidates for systemic therapy or phototherapy, under the brand name Sotyktu. Sotyktu is also under regulatory review by the European Medical Association and other health authorities worldwide.The approval is based on results from the phase III POETYK PSO-1 and POETYK PSO-2 studies, demonstrating superior efficacy of once-daily Sotyktu over placebo and twice-daily Amgen’s AMGN Otezla (apremilast) in 1,684 patients, aged 18 years and above, with moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis. Bristol Myers added deucravacitinib to its pipeline when it acquired Celgene in 2019 and had to let go of Otezla.  In connection with the regulatory approval process for the transaction, Celgene sold the global rights to Otezla to Amgen. The risk should reap rewards with this new drug approval.The FDA had earlier approved a new, first-in-class, fixed-dose combination of PD-1 inhibitor Opdivo (nivolumab) and relatlimab (novel LAG-3-blocking antibody). It is administered as a single intravenous infusion to treat adult and pediatric patients aged 12 years or older with unresectable or metastatic melanoma (a kind of skin cancer) under the brand name Opdualag.  The initial uptake f the drug has been encouraging so far. The drug was also approved in Europe.Story continuesCamzyos (mavacamten, 2.5 mg, 5 mg, 10 mg, 15 mg capsules) was also approved in the United States for treating adults with symptomatic New York Heart Association (NYHA) class II-III obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (obstructive HCM) to improve functional capacity and symptoms.The uptake of the new product portfolio (primarily cell therapy products and Reblozyl) has also boosted sales.Bristol Myers had earlier acquired Turning Point Therapeutics for $4.1 billion. The acquisition added Turning Point’s lead asset, repotrectinib, a next-generation, potential best-in-class tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) targeting the ROS1 and NTRK oncogenic drivers of NSCLC and other advanced solid tumors. The deal should strengthen Bristol Myers’ position in the oncology space, particularly in the lucrative lung cancer arena.Meanwhile, Eliquis has delivered a stellar performance so far in 2022, propelled by increases in share in the novel oral anticoagulant market.  Label expansion of Opdivo boosted sales driven by higher demand across multiple indications, including the Opdivo+Yervoy-based combinations for non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), Opdivo+Cabometyx combination for kidney cancer and Opdivo-based therapies for various gastric and esophageal cancers.However, competition is stiff for Opdivo from the likes of Merck’s MRK Keytruda. The drug, approved for various oncology indications, is the key driver for Merck.The diversification of the portfolio should enable the company to combat these challenges.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

As a result, early assessments indicate phosphate production could be down by approximately 200,000-250,000 tonnes, split roughly evenly between the third and fourth quarters of 2022. Repairs are expected to be completed over the next 1-2 weeks.In addition to production impacts, the timing of shipments was also affected by the storm. Phosphates sales volumes in the third quarter are now expected to total 1.60-1.65 million tonnes, as port and rail closures delayed late third quarter shipments to October. Mosaic plans to provide further updates when it reports third quarter results.As Mosaic completes repairs, The Mosaic Company Foundation is also donating $100,000 to its most hard-hit operating areas. These funds will be used to support local recovery efforts in Florida's Hardee, Manatee and DeSoto counties. Prior to hurricane season beginning, Mosaic provided $55,000 in storm preparation funds to organizations across Central Florida.In addition, The Mosaic Company Foundation contributed $300,000 to an Employee-to-Employee Assistance Fund. This fund will be dispersed to employees who need financial assistance with hurricane recovery efforts throughout central Florida. The company will also double match any contributions made by Mosaic employees to this fund.The Mosaic Company ContactsInvestors:Media:Paul Massoud, 813-775-4260Bill Barksdale, 813-775-4208paul.massoud@mosaicco.comwilliam.barksdale@mosaicco.comAbout The Mosaic CompanyThe Mosaic Company is one of the world's leading producers and marketers of concentrated phosphate and potash crop nutrients.

Unless it gains an extension from Congress, Boeing must meet new modern cockpit-alerting requirements that could significantly delay the planes' entry into service.""With regard to the 737-10, Boeing's current project plan timeline has the 737-10 receiving an amended type certificate no sooner than summer 2023,"" two sources quoted acting FAA Administrator Billy Nolen as saying in a letter to Senator Roger Wicker, the top Republican on the Senate Commerce Committee.The FAA, Boeing and Wicker's office declined to comment.Boeing has recently booked major MAX 10 orders from Delta Air Lines, Canada's WestJet Group and other carriers.Last week, Wicker proposed extending the deadline for Boeing to win approval for the two new variants until September 2024 and hopes to attach the proposal to an annual defense bill. But it is not clear if Congress would be willing to approve the proposal.The new cockpit alerting requirements are part of certification reform legislation that was passed in 2020 after two 737 MAX crashes killed 346 people and led to a 20-month grounding for the best-selling plane.Certifications of planes require extensive paperwork submissions and detailed review of safety assessments by the FAA.In a Sept. 19 letter to Boeing made public last week, the FAA expressed concerns that the plane maker would not be able to win certification for the MAX 7 this year. Boeing must get approval for the MAX 7 first as the MAX 10 approval is contingent on some MAX 7 documentation, Boeing Chief Executive Dave Calhoun said last month.Story continuesThe letter added Boeing has not completed all its required assessments and needed to turn in remaining documents by mid-September if it intended to meet the December deadline.Boeing, which has argued that it is safer to have one common cockpit alerting system for all versions of the 737, said on Friday that it ""is focused on meeting all regulatory requirements to certify the 737-7 and 737-10.""According to one of the sources, Nolen's letter on Monday said the FAA was unable to provide an estimate as to when certification work will be completed for the MAX 7 or MAX 10.""We're committed to diligently and thoroughly reviewing the documentation as it is submitted,"" Nolen was quoted as saying.Nolen also wrote that he supports his team ""taking the time they need to fully understand"" human factor functions, according to the source.Calhoun last month told reporters he thought the FAA would approve the MAX 7 this year and said there was still a ""chance"" of approval for the MAX 10 before the end of the year.(Reporting by David Shepardson; Editing by Edwina Gibbs)]"

The award has been offered by the Naval Supply Systems Command Weapon Systems Support, Philadelphia, PA.Details of the DealValued at $191.8 million, the contract is expected to be completed by July 2025. Per the terms of the deal, Boeing will be engaged in the repair of multiple flight control surfaces used on the F/A-18E/F and E/A-18G aircraft.The majority of the work related to this deal will be carried out in Jacksonville, FL.What’s Favoring Boeing?Boeing, one of the major players in the defense business, stands out among its peers by virtue of its broadly diversified programs, strong order bookings and solid backlog. Furthermore, the company's expertise lies in a wide variety of aircraft components, repairs and modification-related programs.Notably, its Defense, Space &amp; Security segment’s portfolio has fixed-wing military aircraft, including F/A-18E/F Super Hornet, F-15 programs, P-8 programs, KC-46A Tanker and T-7A Red Hawk.  Boeing's combat-proven aerospace programs and associated services, along with the rapidly growing need for military aircraft due to heightened geopolitical uncertainties worldwide, result in a solid inflow of orders from the Pentagon. The latest contract win is an example of that. Such order flows, in turn, should boost the top line of the defense business segment.Growth ProspectsWith rising security threats across the globe, emerging economies like the Asia Pacific, the Middle East and South America are spending a lot on enhancing their defense arsenals. Meanwhile, developed nations like the United States and Europe have already been leading the defense market. With the United States being the largest worldwide weapons exporter, the nation has been spending amply on defense products. Boeing, the largest aircraft manufacturer in the United States, thus enjoys a dominant position in the combat aircraft market.Per a Mordor Intelligence report, the global combat aircraft market is expected to witness a CAGR of 2.5% during the 2021-2026 time period, with North America constituting the largest share of this market. Such growth can be attributed to a rise in global threats and geopolitical instabilities and increased spending on defense. These projections should benefit Boeing along with other U.S.-based combat jet manufacturers like Northrop Grumman NOC, Lockheed Martin LMT and Textron TXT.Story continuesSince its inception, Northrop Grumman has been a pioneer in the development of manned aircraft for combat.

(NASDAQ:ILMN), a global leader in DNA sequencing and array-based technologies, announced multiple breakthrough sequencing innovations at its inaugural Illumina Genomics Forum:The launch of NovaSeq™ 6000 Dx as the first FDA-registered and CE-marked in vitro diagnostic (IVD) high-throughput sequencer, delivering the highest standards of compliance and driving actionable insights for patient care. This technology expands the breadth of applications and clinical testing in countries that require IVD products, increasing access to clinical genomics with scalable throughput, while also achieving significant reductions in cost/Gb and total cost of ownership. NovaSeq 6000 Dx is an open platform, with RUO and IVD modes and a dedicated DRAGEN™ server, resulting in flexible, high-quality, automated data processing that will minimize the time and labor required to complete projects.Illumina® Complete Long-Reads, formerly known as Infinity, will accelerate access to the remaining 5% of genic regions with a scalable, high-throughput, low DNA-input long read technology. Further, the technology provides a complete and accurate representation of the genome at the single molecule level without needing a new platform. In addition, it offers contiguous long reads to close key gaps.Two products will be launched with full end-to-end workflows in 2023. The first product, currently in early access, is a whole-genome assay that uses long contiguous reads to further extend the coverage and completeness of our existing 30x genome. The second is an enrichment panel targeting only the difficult to map regions of the genome. When combined with the 30x genome on NovaSeq 6000 and NovaSeq X Series, the panel delivers a significant improvement in throughput and cost versus on-market long read technology for human whole-genome sequencing.​Story continuesThe creation of XLEAP-SBS™ Chemistry, formerly referred to as Chemistry X, delivers fundamentally new sequencing by synthesis (SBS) chemistry engineered for increased speed, greater fidelity, and more robustness. With up to 2x faster incorporation speed up to 3x greater accuracy, and engineered for longer reads, XLEAP-SBS Chemistry opens incredible possibilities for the future Illumina roadmap and enables new thermostable reagents to support ambient-temperature shipping.With a current install base of more than 1,250 units, the NextSeq™ 1000/2000 Roadmap will deliver a new, higher output P4 flow cell and XLEAP-SBS Chemistry in early 2024. The addition of XLEAP-SBS chemistry and P4 flow cells, anticipated to generate 500Gb of output, will enhance sequencing capabilities, expanding application breadth of the platforms while lowering sequencing costs and improving performance. These kits will follow the forthcoming release of 2x300bp kits, which are currently in early access and scheduled to ship broadly later this year.NovaSeq X Series (NovaSeq X and NovaSeq X Plus), unveiled last week, ushers in the era of the genome with revolutionary new production-scale sequencers that will push the limits of what is possible with genomic medicine, enabling faster, more powerful, and more sustainable sequencing. Using revolutionary new technology, NovaSeq X Plus can generate more than 20,000 whole genomes per year - 2.5 times the throughput of prior sequencers - greatly accelerating genomic discovery and clinical insights, to understand disease and ultimately transform patient lives.NovaSeq X also utilizes groundbreaking innovations that significantly reduce waste and environmental impact, reflecting Illumina's commitment to using its technology to support the health of people and the planet. NovaSeq X features a 90% reduction in packaging waste and weight and a 50% reduction in plastic usage compared to NovaSeq 6000. The enablement of ambient-temperature shipping of reagents will result in nearly 500 tons of dry ice savings per year, while significantly reducing waste streams for our customers. More information can be found at illumina.com/novaseqx.""Today's announcement of NovaSeq X Series and Illumina's other breakthrough technologies is the culmination of more than five years of development, more than 40 patent filings, and the tenacity and talent of 1500 of the world's most brilliant scientists, engineers, developers, and designers on our team,"" said Francis deSouza, Illumina's Chief Executive Officer. ""I'm thrilled to imagine how our customers, including scientists, researchers, and clinicians, will do more, discover more, and dream bigger as a result of these game-changing innovations.

The award has been offered by the Naval Supply Systems Command Weapon Systems Support, Philadelphia, PA.Details of the DealValued at $191.8 million, the contract is expected to be completed by July 2025. Per the terms of the deal, Boeing will be engaged in the repair of multiple flight control surfaces used on the F/A-18E/F and E/A-18G aircraft.The majority of the work related to this deal will be carried out in Jacksonville, FL.What’s Favoring Boeing?Boeing, one of the major players in the defense business, stands out among its peers by virtue of its broadly diversified programs, strong order bookings and solid backlog. Furthermore, the company's expertise lies in a wide variety of aircraft components, repairs and modification-related programs.Notably, its Defense, Space &amp; Security segment’s portfolio has fixed-wing military aircraft, including F/A-18E/F Super Hornet, F-15 programs, P-8 programs, KC-46A Tanker and T-7A Red Hawk.  Boeing's combat-proven aerospace programs and associated services, along with the rapidly growing need for military aircraft due to heightened geopolitical uncertainties worldwide, result in a solid inflow of orders from the Pentagon. The latest contract win is an example of that. Such order flows, in turn, should boost the top line of the defense business segment.Growth ProspectsWith rising security threats across the globe, emerging economies like the Asia Pacific, the Middle East and South America are spending a lot on enhancing their defense arsenals. Meanwhile, developed nations like the United States and Europe have already been leading the defense market. With the United States being the largest worldwide weapons exporter, the nation has been spending amply on defense products. Boeing, the largest aircraft manufacturer in the United States, thus enjoys a dominant position in the combat aircraft market.Per a Mordor Intelligence report, the global combat aircraft market is expected to witness a CAGR of 2.5% during the 2021-2026 time period, with North America constituting the largest share of this market. Such growth can be attributed to a rise in global threats and geopolitical instabilities and increased spending on defense.

""Sentiment is washed out, meaning that everyone is pretty bearish. Even the strategists out there that have been more bullish have kind of turned and become more bearish.""""So if we get any good news like the Fed pivots a little bit, if Treasury yields just stop going up, if oil prices came down ... those would all be things that could make a short-term bounce in global equities,"" Miskin added.Fighting bulls are seen on a ranch in Portezuelo, Spain, on April 24, 2020. REUTERS/Juan MedinaIt's understandable why everyone's so bearish: A number of factors converged in the last quarter to damage market sentiment.For one, the Federal Reserve continued its mission to stomp out inflation by aggressively hiking interest rates. The effects have rippled across an array of asset markets, from the surging U.S. dollar to rising mortgage rates that are nearing 7%.""What they're doing today is actually going to show up in terms of tightening in the economy next year,"" Miskin explained. ""And so you can't just stop inflation in its tracks. If you do want to, which that's what they want to do, the best way to do it is cause a global recession. But the thing is, you're bringing in all these other risks into the picture. And by the time the data shows up, it's actually too late.""Those crosscurrents are beginning to show up in economic data and corporate earnings. Last Thursday, the Bureau of Economic Analysis reported that U.S. GDP declined in the first half of the year. And earlier in September, concerns about slowing growth materialized when FedEx (FDX) shocked the market by slashing its full-year guidance.Retailers are also showing signs of battling an economic slowdown, with North Face owner V.F. Corp issuing a full-year profit warning and Nike warning on sales and profits last week. And reports have surfaced that Apple plans to cut iPhone production due to growth fears, prompting a headline-grabbing downgrade on the tech giant's stock by Bank of America Analyst Wamsi Mohan.Story continuesThe broader indices appropriately reflect the gloom. Year to date, the Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI), S&amp;P 500 (^GSPC), and Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) are down 18%, 22%, and 30%, respectively.This content is not available due to your privacy preferences.Update your settings here to see it.The current pullback in the S&amp;P 500 is now the longest from peak to trough since the March 2009 low at 269 days and counting, according to research from Compound Capital Advisors.At a decline of 25.2%, this year’s correction has been worse than the average pullback of 7.6% going back to 2009.Other strategists expect that selling pressure to continue as risk factors mount.""Rising interest rates, slowing growth, and increased unemployment will drive households to continue selling stocks,"" Goldman Sachs strategist David Kostin warned in a new note.

""Sentiment is washed out, meaning that everyone is pretty bearish. Even the strategists out there that have been more bullish have kind of turned and become more bearish.""""So if we get any good news like the Fed pivots a little bit, if Treasury yields just stop going up, if oil prices came down ... those would all be things that could make a short-term bounce in global equities,"" Miskin added.Fighting bulls are seen on a ranch in Portezuelo, Spain, on April 24, 2020. REUTERS/Juan MedinaIt's understandable why everyone's so bearish: A number of factors converged in the last quarter to damage market sentiment.For one, the Federal Reserve continued its mission to stomp out inflation by aggressively hiking interest rates. The effects have rippled across an array of asset markets, from the surging U.S. dollar to rising mortgage rates that are nearing 7%.""What they're doing today is actually going to show up in terms of tightening in the economy next year,"" Miskin explained. ""And so you can't just stop inflation in its tracks. If you do want to, which that's what they want to do, the best way to do it is cause a global recession. But the thing is, you're bringing in all these other risks into the picture. And by the time the data shows up, it's actually too late.""Those crosscurrents are beginning to show up in economic data and corporate earnings. Last Thursday, the Bureau of Economic Analysis reported that U.S. GDP declined in the first half of the year. And earlier in September, concerns about slowing growth materialized when FedEx (FDX) shocked the market by slashing its full-year guidance.Retailers are also showing signs of battling an economic slowdown, with North Face owner V.F. Corp issuing a full-year profit warning and Nike warning on sales and profits last week. And reports have surfaced that Apple plans to cut iPhone production due to growth fears, prompting a headline-grabbing downgrade on the tech giant's stock by Bank of America Analyst Wamsi Mohan.Story continuesThe broader indices appropriately reflect the gloom.

He is upgrading Wells Fargo, and downgrading Citigroup. Interesting call here where-- let's get to the Wells Fargo here. It's going to buy from neutral according to him, and the price target is going up to $48 from $46.He says it's an underappreciated earnings growth story because it's got best-in-class revenue upside, it's got efficiency improvement. So pretty interesting here. It also says-- he also says in a recessionary scenario Wells Fargo has less credit risk downside than peers. Basically, because it hasn't been doing as well in loan growth in recent years, so it's got a smaller portfolio.And then on the flip-side, if you look at what he's saying about Citigroup here, he's saying it is more vulnerable in a recessionary scenario, which is really interesting because of the cards in its portfolio, that its card skew he says is the largest percentage of the loan book of any of its peers, which would then cause it to maybe have to you know, take some hits if people are not paying off their credit cards at the same rate or not taking out as much credit card debt in the case of a recession. So pretty interesting call here.BRIAN SOZZI: Yeah. Richard's been covering this industry forever. So I'm hesitant to push back too much, but you don't normally see an upgrade on Wells Fargo. They have been putting up some very difficult quarters. I will note-- call this out too as part of Richard's call on Wells Fargo, ""I see further idiosyncratic expense rationalization."" What does that mean in plain English? Basically, he sees Wells Fargo cutting more expenses to help improve their bottom line in coming quarters.BRAD SMITH: Yeah. And for Wells Fargo, it's been a continuous story over the past three, four years for them to really just get back into good graces with the consumer, with the actual end user of some of the products, the services financially that they offer. And so it's now a broader question of have they done enough to turn a corner and really hold on to some of the momentum that even the analysts of the banks would look at and say, OK, there's possibility for growth here, and so that's a longer-term question. And strategically, there's been a lot of effort from Wells Fargo, it's just this question of is that enough to satisfy the consumer.BRIAN SOZZI: We'll see in a couple of weeks when earnings hit the tape.]"

(NYSE: PFE) today announced positive topline results from the Phase 3 TALAPRO-2 study of TALZENNA® (talazoparib), an oral poly ADP-ribose polymerase (PARP) inhibitor, in combination with XTANDI® (enzalutamide) compared to placebo plus XTANDI in men with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC), with or without homologous recombination repair (HRR) gene mutations. The study met its primary endpoint with a statistically significant and clinically meaningful improvement in radiographic progression-free survival (rPFS) compared with placebo plus XTANDI. The results of the primary endpoint exceeded the pre-specified hazard ratio of 0.696.Results showed a trend toward improved overall survival, a key secondary endpoint, at the time of the analysis, but these data are not yet mature. Benefits were also observed in other secondary endpoints, including investigator assessed rPFS, prostate specific antigen (PSA) response, time to PSA progression, and overall response rate. Other secondary endpoints are being analyzed. At the time of topline analysis, the safety of TALZENNA plus XTANDI were generally consistent with the known safety profile of each medicine.""XTANDI is a global standard of care, with overall survival demonstrated in mCRPC, non-metastatic CRPC, and metastatic castration-sensitive prostate cancer (mCSPC),"" said Chris Boshoff, M.D., Ph.D., Chief Development Officer, Oncology and Rare Disease, Pfizer Global Product Development. ""We are very pleased with the strong findings from TALAPRO-2, and although no definitive conclusions can be made across trials, the rPFS appears to be the longest observed in a randomized trial in this setting. These data highlight the potential for TALZENNA in combination with XTANDI, if approved, to become a new standard of care for mCRPC, irrespective of HRR gene mutation status. We look forward to discussing these data with global health authorities.""Story continues""These exciting results from TALAPRO-2 underscore our long-standing commitment to men living with prostate cancer and delivering the next scientific breakthroughs,"" said Suneet Varma, Global Oncology and U.S. President, Pfizer. ""Based on these compelling combination data with XTANDI, we believe TALZENNA in prostate cancer may become the next potential blockbuster opportunity in our leading Pfizer Oncology portfolio, subject to regulatory approval.""Detailed results from TALAPRO-2 will be submitted for presentation at a near-term medical congress. These data will also be shared with global regulatory authorities to potentially support a regulatory filing.TALZENNA or the combination of TALZENNA plus XTANDI have not been approved by any regulatory agency for the treatment of mCRPC. In addition to the TALAPRO-2 trial, the combination of TALZENNA plus XTANDI is being investigated in the TALAPRO-3 trial (NCT04821622), a global, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase 3 study in men with HRR-deficient mCSPC.About Metastatic Castration-Resistant Prostate CancerMetastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) is a cancer that has spread beyond the prostate gland and has progressed despite medical or surgical treatment to lower testosterone. Approximately 10%–20% of prostate cancer patients develop mCRPC within 5−7 years of diagnosis,1 and in the U.S., in 2020, approximately 60-90 thousand cases of the three million prostate cancer cases were mCRPC.2About TALAPRO-2The Phase 3 TALAPRO-2 trial is a two-part, two-cohort, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study that enrolled 1,095 patients with mCRPC (with no systemic treatments initiated after documentation of mCRPC) at sites in the U.S., Canada, Europe, South America, and the Asia-Pacific region. The study included two patient cohorts: all-comers (n=750) and those with HRR mutations (HRRm; n=380). Patients on androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) or who had bilateral orchiectomy in the trial were randomized to receive TALZENNA 0.5 mg/day plus XTANDI 160mg/day, or placebo plus XTANDI 160 mg/day.The primary endpoint of the trial is radiographic progression-free survival (rPFS), defined as the time from the date of randomization to first objective evidence of radiographic progression by blinded independent review, or death, whichever occurs first, in both cohort 1 (all-comers) and cohort 2 (those with HRRm). The trial is still ongoing for cohort 2. Secondary endpoints include overall survival, objective response rate, duration of response and PSA response.For more information on the TALAPRO-2 trial (NCT03395197) go to www.clinicaltrials.gov.About TALZENNA® (talazoparib)TALZENNA (talazoparib) is an inhibitor of PARP enzymes, which play a role in the DNA damage repair response. Preclinical studies have demonstrated that TALZENNA blocks PARP enzyme activity and traps PARP at the site of DNA damage, leading to decreased cancer cell growth and cancer cell death. TALZENNA is being evaluated in several ongoing clinical trials in prostate cancer, as well as other novel combinations with targeted therapies in various solid tumors. TALZENNA was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration in 2018 for the treatment of adult patients with deleterious or suspected deleterious germline breast cancer susceptibility gene (BRCA)-mutated (gBRCAm) human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-negative locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer.Indication in the U.S.TALZENNA (talazoparib) is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with deleterious or suspected deleterious germline breast cancer susceptibility gene (BRCA)-mutated (gBRCAm) human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-negative locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer. Select patients for therapy based on an FDA-approved companion diagnostic for TALZENNA.TALZENNA® (talazoparib) Important Safety InformationMyelodysplastic Syndrome/Acute Myeloid Leukemia (MDS/AML) have been reported in patients who received TALZENNA. Overall, MDS/AML has been reported in &lt;1% (3 out of 787, 0.4%) of solid tumor patients treated with TALZENNA in clinical studies. The duration of TALZENNA treatment in these three patients prior to developing MDS/AML was 4 months, 24 months, and 60 months respectively. These patients had received previous chemotherapy with platinum agents and/or other DNA damaging agents including radiotherapy.Myelosuppression consisting of anemia, leukopenia/neutropenia, and/or thrombocytopenia have been reported in patients treated with TALZENNA. Grade ≥3 anemia, neutropenia, and thrombocytopenia were reported, respectively, in 39%, 21%, and 15% of patients receiving TALZENNA. Discontinuation due to anemia, neutropenia, and thrombocytopenia occurred, respectively, in 0.7%, 0.3%, and 0.3% of patients.Monitor complete blood counts for cytopenia at baseline and monthly thereafter. Do not start TALZENNA until patients have adequately recovered from hematological toxicity caused by previous therapy. If hematological toxicity occurs, dose modifications (dosing interruption with or without dose reduction) are recommended. With respect to MDS/AML, for prolonged hematological toxicities, interrupt TALZENNA and monitor blood counts weekly until recovery. If the levels have not recovered after 4 weeks, refer the patient to a hematologist for further investigations. If MDS/AML is confirmed, discontinue TALZENNA.TALZENNA can cause fetal harm when administered to pregnant women. Advise women of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment and for at least 7 months following the last dose. A pregnancy test is recommended for females of reproductive potential prior to initiating TALZENNA treatment. Advise male patients with female partners of reproductive potential or who are pregnant to use effective contraception during treatment with TALZENNA and for at least 4 months after receiving the last dose. Based on animal studies, TALZENNA may impair fertility in males of reproductive potential. Advise women not to breastfeed while taking TALZENNA and for at least 1 month after receiving the last dose because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in nursing infants.The most common adverse reactions (≥20%) of any grade for TALZENNA vs chemotherapy were fatigue (62% vs 50%), anemia (53% vs 18%), nausea (49% vs 47%), neutropenia (35% vs 43%), headache (33% vs 22%), thrombocytopenia (27% vs 7%), vomiting (25% vs 23%), alopecia (25% vs 28%), diarrhea (22% vs 26%), and decreased appetite (21% vs 22%).The most frequently reported Grade ≥3 adverse reactions (≥10%) for TALZENNA vs chemotherapy were anemia (39% vs 5%), neutropenia (21% vs 35%), and thrombocytopenia (15% vs 2%).The most common lab abnormalities (≥25%) for TALZENNA vs chemotherapy were decreases in hemoglobin (90% vs 77%), leukocytes (84% vs 73%), lymphocytes (76% vs 53%), neutrophils (68% vs 70%), platelets (55% vs 29%), and calcium (28% vs 16%) and increases in glucose (54% vs 51%), aspartate aminotransferase (37% vs 48%), alkaline phosphatase (36% vs 34%), and alanine aminotransferase (33% vs 37%).Coadministration with P-gp inhibitors or BCRP inhibitors may increase TALZENNA exposure. If coadministering with the P-gp inhibitors amiodarone, carvedilol, clarithromycin, itraconazole, or verapamil is unavoidable, reduce the TALZENNA dose to 0.75 mg once daily. When the P-gp inhibitor is discontinued, increase the TALZENNA dose (after 3–5 half-lives of the P-gp inhibitor) to the dose used prior to the initiation of the P-gp inhibitor. When coadministering TALZENNA with other known P-gp inhibitors or BCRP inhibitors, monitor patients for potential increased adverse reactions.For patients with moderate renal impairment, the recommended dose of TALZENNA is 0.75 mg once daily. For patients with severe renal impairment, the recommended dose of TALZENNA is 0.5 mg once daily. No dose adjustment is required for patients with mild renal impairment. TALZENNA has not been studied in patients requiring hemodialysis.Please see full U.S. Prescribing Information and Patient Information for TALZENNA® (talazoparib) at www.TALZENNA.com.About XTANDI® (enzalutamide) and Important Safety InformationXTANDI (enzalutamide) is an androgen receptor inhibitor indicated in the U.S. for the treatment of patients with castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) and metastatic castration-sensitive prostate cancer (mCSPC).Overall survival benefit has been observed in patients treated with XTANDI in mCRPC, nmCRPC, and mCSPC.Warnings and PrecautionsSeizure occurred in 0.5% of patients receiving XTANDI in seven randomized clinical trials. In a study of patients with predisposing factors for seizure, 2.2% of XTANDI-treated patients experienced a seizure. It is unknown whether anti-epileptic medications will prevent seizures with XTANDI. Patients in the study had one or more of the following predisposing factors: use of medications that may lower the seizure threshold, history of traumatic brain or head injury, history of cerebrovascular accident or transient ischemic attack, and Alzheimer’s disease, meningioma, or leptomeningeal disease from prostate cancer, unexplained loss of consciousness within the last 12 months, history of seizure, presence of a space occupying lesion of the brain, history of arteriovenous malformation, or history of brain infection. Advise patients of the risk of developing a seizure while taking XTANDI and of engaging in any activity where sudden loss of consciousness could cause serious harm to themselves or others. Permanently discontinue XTANDI in patients who develop a seizure during treatment.Posterior Reversible Encephalopathy Syndrome (PRES) There have been reports of PRES in patients receiving XTANDI. PRES is a neurological disorder that can present with rapidly evolving symptoms including seizure, headache, lethargy, confusion, blindness, and other visual and neurological disturbances, with or without associated hypertension. A diagnosis of PRES requires confirmation by brain imaging, preferably MRI. Discontinue XTANDI in patients who develop PRES.Hypersensitivity reactions, including edema of the face (0.5%), tongue (0.1%), or lip (0.1%) have been observed with XTANDI in seven randomized clinical trials. Pharyngeal edema has been reported in post-marketing cases. Advise patients who experience any symptoms of hypersensitivity to temporarily discontinue XTANDI and promptly seek medical care. Permanently discontinue XTANDI for serious hypersensitivity reactions.Ischemic Heart Disease In the combined data of four randomized, placebo-controlled clinical studies, ischemic heart disease occurred more commonly in patients on the XTANDI arm compared to patients on the placebo arm (2.9% vs 1.3%). Grade 3-4 ischemic events occurred in 1.4% of patients on XTANDI versus 0.7% on placebo. Ischemic events led to death in 0.4% of patients on XTANDI compared to 0.1% on placebo. Monitor for signs and symptoms of ischemic heart disease. Optimize management of cardiovascular risk factors, such as hypertension, diabetes, or dyslipidemia. Discontinue XTANDI for Grade 3-4 ischemic heart disease.Falls and Fractures occurred in patients receiving XTANDI. Evaluate patients for fracture and fall risk. Monitor and manage patients at risk for fractures according to established treatment guidelines and consider use of bone-targeted agents. In the combined data of four randomized, placebo-controlled clinical studies, falls occurred in 11% of patients treated with XTANDI compared to 4% of patients treated with placebo. Fractures occurred in 10% of patients treated with XTANDI and in 4% of patients treated with placebo.Embryo-Fetal Toxicity The safety and efficacy of XTANDI have not been established in females. XTANDI can cause fetal harm and loss of pregnancy when administered to a pregnant female. Advise males with female partners of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with XTANDI and for 3 months after the last dose of XTANDI.Adverse Reactions (ARs)In the data from the four randomized placebo-controlled trials, the most common ARs (≥ 10%) that occurred more frequently (≥ 2% over placebo) in XTANDI-treated patients were asthenia/fatigue, back pain, hot flush, constipation, arthralgia, decreased appetite, diarrhea, and hypertension. In the bicalutamide-controlled study, the most common ARs (≥ 10%) reported in XTANDI-treated patients were asthenia/fatigue, back pain, musculoskeletal pain, hot flush, hypertension, nausea, constipation, diarrhea, upper respiratory tract infection, and weight loss.In AFFIRM, the placebo-controlled study of metastatic CRPC (mCRPC) patients who previously received docetaxel, Grade 3 and higher ARs were reported among 47% of XTANDI-treated patients. Discontinuations due to adverse events (AEs) were reported for 16% of XTANDI-treated patients. In PREVAIL, the placebo-controlled study of chemotherapy-naive mCRPC patients, Grade 3-4 ARs were reported in 44% of XTANDI patients and 37% of placebo patients. Discontinuations due to AEs were reported for 6% of XTANDI-treated patients. In TERRAIN, the bicalutamide-controlled study of chemotherapy-naive mCRPC patients, Grade 3-4 ARs were reported in 39% of XTANDI patients and 38% of bicalutamide patients. Discontinuations with an AE as the primary reason were reported for 8% of XTANDI patients and 6% of bicalutamide patients.In PROSPER, the placebo-controlled study of non-metastatic CRPC (nmCRPC) patients, Grade 3 or higher ARs were reported in 31% of XTANDI patients and 23% of placebo patients. Discontinuations with an AE as the primary reason were reported for 9% of XTANDI patients and 6% of placebo patients.In ARCHES, the placebo-controlled study of metastatic CSPC (mCSPC) patients, Grade 3 or higher AEs were reported in 24% of XTANDI-treated patients. Permanent discontinuation due to AEs as the primary reason was reported in 5% of XTANDI patients and 4% of placebo patients.Lab Abnormalities: Lab abnormalities that occurred in ≥ 5% of patients, and more frequently (&gt; 2%) in the XTANDI arm compared to placebo in the pooled, randomized, placebo-controlled studies are neutrophil count decreased, white blood cell decreased, hyperglycemia, hypermagnesemia, hyponatremia, and hypercalcemia.Hypertension: In the combined data from four randomized placebo-controlled clinical trials, hypertension was reported in 12% of XTANDI patients and 5% of placebo patients. Hypertension led to study discontinuation in &lt; 1% of patients in each arm.Drug InteractionsEffect of Other Drugs on XTANDI Avoid strong CYP2C8 inhibitors, as they can increase the plasma exposure to XTANDI. If co-administration is necessary, reduce the dose of XTANDI.Avoid strong CYP3A4 inducers as they can decrease the plasma exposure to XTANDI. If co-administration is necessary, increase the dose of XTANDI.Effect of XTANDI on Other Drugs Avoid CYP3A4, CYP2C9, and CYP2C19 substrates with a narrow therapeutic index, as XTANDI may decrease the plasma exposures of these drugs. If XTANDI is co-administered with warfarin (CYP2C9 substrate), conduct additional INR monitoring.Please see Full Prescribing Information for additional safety information.About Pfizer OncologyAt Pfizer Oncology, we are committed to advancing medicines wherever we believe we can make a meaningful difference in the lives of people living with cancer.

Therefore, it should play a key role in investment portfolios for the long term and as the economy slows down.Let’s take a look at a healthcare stock Investors may want to consider buying.Bristol Myers Squibb BMY Bristol Myers Squibb is one of the leading global specialty biopharmaceutical companies focused on the development of treatments targeting serious diseases such as cancer. Bristol Myers has a strong oncology portfolio that includes its well-known drug Opdivo, Revlimid, Pomalyst, Sprycel, Yervoy, and Empliciti.Outside of Oncology, Bristol Myers Squibb has important drugs for immunology and cardiovascular diseases. The company’s diversified portfolio of treatments for a variety of diseases has led to continued growth over the last decade. The company also acquired Celgene Corporation in 2019.After acquiring Celgene, Bristol Myers Squibb has increased its drug pipeline to address patients’ needs for cancer, inflammatory, immunologic, and fibrotic treatments.Performance Year to date, BMY is up +12% to crush the S&amp;P 500’s -25% decline. BMY’s YTD performance indicates the stock has been a viable hedge against inflation because people can ill afford to cut back on health-focused spending.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchBMY stock is up +8% in the last five years. But it is now up +18% in the past two years to surpass the benchmark and blast away its Medical-Biomedical and Genetics Markets -42% decline.Outlook Bristol Myers has clearly shown itself as an industry leader and the trend looks set to continue. Earnings growth is projected to essentially be flat this year at $7.50 a share, but FY23 earnings are expected to be up 8%. Sales are projected to be down 1% this year but climb 4% in FY23 at $47.76 billion, based on Zacks estimates.The cost of acquiring Celgene was pricey at $74 billion, a 53% premium to the price of Celgene’s stock at the time. However, the boost in revenue has already been reflected in Bristol Myers earnings. Through the acquisition, Bristol Myers gained access to Revlimid, used to treat Multiple Myeloma cancer and one of the world’s top-selling drugs.Story continuesAlthough Revlimid’s revenue was down 22% during the second quarter, the drug still brought in $2.5 billion in revenue. Plus, BMY’s annual earnings were up 62% in 2020 after the Celgene acquisition and another 9% in FY21 at $46.38 billion.Growth of EliquisThe growth of Bristol Myer’s top-selling drug Eliquis remains impressive and has been well noted by analysts and the medical community. Eliquis, which is used in the treatment of blood clots continued to show growth during the second quarter. Eliquis revenue climbed 16% to $3.2 billion. Although Bristol Myers must share 50% of Eliquis earnings with Pfizer PFE due to regulations, the drug still accounted for 27% of the company’s revenue during the second quarter.Eliquis was fifth in worldwide drug sales in 2021, with Pfizer’s Covid-19 vaccine Comirnaty topping the list. Eliquis drug sales were $16.75 billion last year and the continued growth has many believing it may become the top-selling drug in the world.The need to treat blood disorders will remain constant, unlike the uncertain outlook and necessity for Covid-19 vaccines and boosters. This makes Bristol Myers stock very intriguing for longer-term investors to consider as Eliquis and its diverse oncology drugs are well positioned for the future.ValuationTrading around $70 a share, BMY has a P/E of 9.4X which is lower than the industry average of 19.2X. This is also near its median of 8.9X over the last two years and below the high of 10.5X.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchBMY is also much more attractively valued compared to its Medical-Biomed/Genetics Market with an average P/E of 62.8X. Plus, BMY is expected to have 6% earnings growth over the next five years. And Bristol Myers’s price to sales at 3.2X is considerably lower than the industry average of 9.4X.Bottom LineBMY currently lands a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) and its Medical-Biomedical and Genetics Industry is in the top 34% of over 250 Zacks Industries. Investors may want to consider holding the stock for its diversified drug portfolio. The growth of Bristol Myers blood thinner drug Eliquis continues to be impressive and could lead to massive earnings in the future.Bristol Myers also offers a solid dividend for patient investors with an annual dividend yield of 3.04% at $2.16 a share. BMY has raised its dividend in each of the last five years and the average Zacks Price Target suggests 11% upside from current levels.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

As of September 30, the Nasdaq composite index has declined 33% year to date. Investors that are in the stock market for the long term can rack up shares of leading companies in the space while they are still at or close to the bottom. Some of the biggest players in the machine learning industry include Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG), and Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN).caspar-camille-rubin-N_lrIeCWgw0-unsplashOur MethodologyTo determine the 10 best machine learning stocks to buy now, we reviewed the industry and identified major players that develop software and hardware for machine learning applications.

We invested in the stock in the third quarter of 2019 during a cyclical downturn in the memory industry. Our rationale was that, while the memory industry is cyclical, we believed there are strong secular drivers in place that will lead to higher peaks and long-term growth. Our secular thesis is based on our conviction that the quest for ever-increasing compute speeds will increasingly rely on memory to solve bottlenecks and that increased memory content in nearly everything from mobile phones to automobiles will drive demand. Micron’s stock traded lower during the quarter due to macroeconomic concerns that led to lower earnings expectations. We increased our stake in the company, as we believe our secular thesis remains intact. We wanted to take advantage of what we view as temporary cyclical concerns that caused the stock to trade at less than 10x reasonable trough earnings per share (EPS) estimates and less than 7x recent peak EPS.”7. CrowdStrike Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:CRWD)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 77CrowdStrike Holdings, Inc.

(NASDAQ:CRWD) in its second-quarter 2022 investor letter:“CrowdStrike Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:CRWD), a security software platform for protecting information technology assets and cloud workloads, delivered strong earnings results, with solid recurring revenue, customer growth, and profitability. Some investors, however, hoped for bigger numbers on the annual recurring revenue metric. Additionally, CrowdStrike has shown a desire to continue to hire to fuel growth, and so the expected increase in future profitability will be held back somewhat in the near term.

While four of our holdings contributed to performance, the contribution to absolute returns was less than 100bps combined, as unfortunately none of them were large enough to move the needle. We had 16 investments detracting over 100bps each with NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA), our second largest detractor, costing the Fund 254bps.NVIDIA’s stock was hit even harder, down 44.4%, impacted by concerns over the health of the consumer, dramatic declines in crypto, and COVID-related lockdowns in China.

178,55e31f10-e718-3f83-b6a6-55a108286096,IBM,2022-10-04,Investors Heavily Search International Business Machines Corporation (IBM): Here is What You Need to Know,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/investors-heavily-search-international-business-130001429.html,1664802001,STORY,['IBM'],"[IBM (IBM) has recently been on Zacks.com's list of the most searched stocks. Therefore, you might want to consider some of the key factors that could influence the stock's performance in the near future.Shares of this technology and consulting company have returned -7% over the past month versus the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's -9.2% change. The Zacks Computer - Integrated Systems industry, to which IBM belongs, has lost 8.8% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?Although media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.Revisions to Earnings EstimatesRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.Our analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.For the current quarter, IBM is expected to post earnings of $2.28 per share, indicating a change of -9.5% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate remained unchanged over the last 30 days.The consensus earnings estimate of $9.39 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of +18.4%. This estimate has changed -0.9% over the last 30 days.Story continuesFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $10.09 indicates a change of +7.5% from what IBM is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed +0.4%.Having a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, IBM is rated Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPS12-month consensus EPS estimate for IBM _12MonthEPSChartUrlProjected Revenue GrowthEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.For IBM, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $13.75 billion indicates a year-over-year change of -22%. For the current and next fiscal years, $59.9 billion and $61.2 billion estimates indicate -15.4% and +2.2% changes, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryIBM reported revenues of $15.54 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -17.1%. EPS of $2.31 for the same period compares with $2.33 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $15.12 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +2.75%. The EPS surprise was +0.87%.Over the last four quarters, IBM surpassed consensus EPS estimates three times. The company topped consensus revenue estimates two times over this period.ValuationNo investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.Comparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.As part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.IBM is graded B on this front, indicating that it is trading at a discount to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.ConclusionThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about IBM. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

179,7c4b83d5-87dd-3e7a-80e1-5eb4cb333f80,IBM,2022-10-04,The Next Big Thing in Tech? 7 Quantum Computing Stocks to Bet On.,InvestorPlace,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/next-big-thing-tech-7-172517878.html,1664558717,STORY,"['RGTI', 'MSFT', 'IBM', 'GOOGL', 'NVDA', 'TSM']","[What will be the next big thing in technology? Some futurists have made the case for quantum computing stocks.Quantum computing aims to reimagine the future of advanced calculations. Historically, computing power has grown at a predictable rate largely constrained by Moore’s Law. This is the observation that as the number of transistors on a semiconductor chip tends to double every two years, the cost of computing drops by half. This has long governed the pace of innovation in the computing industry.However, we’re hitting physical limits to how much smaller chip fabrication technologies can reach. Moore’s Law can’t go on forever. To deliver further exponential gains, a new computing technique will be needed. According to Microsoft’s (NASDAQ:MSFT) fact sheet, “Quantum computers harness the unique behavior of quantum physics — such as superposition, entanglement, and quantum interference — and apply it to computing.”InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsIf successfully applied at a commercial scale, this new technique could offer breakthroughs in fields as diverse as artificial intelligence (AI), biotechnology, computation chemistry and autonomous driving. Here are seven quantum computing stocks that could stand to benefit.GOOGAlphabet$98.03NVDANvidia$124.24IBMIBM$120.77MSFTMicrosoft$236.92TSMTaiwan Semiconductor$69.12RGTIRigetti Computing$1.90IONQIonQ$5.36Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL)Alphabet Inc. (GOOG, GOOGL) and Google logos seen displayed on smartphones. The Google stock split is happening today.Source: IgorGolovniov / Shutterstock.comMany discussions of quantum computing start with Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL). In 2019, Google announced that it had achieved “quantum supremacy,” in which its quantum computer Sycamore achieved the rapid calculation of a problem that would take existing supercomputers thousands of years to achieve.This claim has since come under fire. In 2022, Chinese scientists responded, saying they had built a classical computer that could achieve the calculation in a similar period of time and outperform Sycamore. As happens on the cutting edge of science, a great deal of rivalry and competition remains.Story continuesIn any case, Google’s announcement set off a land rush in the quantum computing space. Google has a unique position in that if its Sycamore project has increasing success, it can leverage that across a wide variety of other futuristic Google ventures such as AI, healthcare and autonomous driving. It may take a long time for any quantum computing venture to add much to Google’s top line given how massive the core search and advertising business is by comparison. However, this stock is clearly part of the quantum computing conversation.Nvidia (NVDA)Closeup of mobile phone screen with logo lettering of nvidia corporation on computer keyboard. NVDA stock.Source: ShutterstockNvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) has its sights on a number of next-generation technology applications. One of these includes quantum computing. Nvidia appears to be marketing itself as a picks-and-shovels sort of way to get exposure to the industry.It can do this via creating quantum simulations. Here’s the company’s explanation: “NVIDIA cuQuantum is an SDK of optimized libraries and tools for accelerating quantum computing workflows. With NVIDIA GPU Tensor Core GPUs, developers can use cuQuantum to speed up quantum circuit simulations based on state vector and tensor network methods by orders of magnitude.”Quantum computing is unlikely to be a primary driver of NVDA’s stock price in the near future. But it could add another catalyst to the company’s growth outlook over time.IBM (IBM)Photo of IBM (IBM) building as seen through the canopy of a tree. IBM logo is in large letters on side of building.Source: shutterstock.com/LCVIBM (NYSE:IBM) has been working on developing its own quantum computing systems for quite awhile. And it’s had a significant amount of success to date. Its Hummingbird computing system hit 65 qubits of operating capability in 2020. IBM is aiming to top 1,000 qubits within the next couple of years. The capacity of qubits is a key consideration for when this technology may reach commercial viability.Investors might be skeptical of IBM’s abilities here. After all, the company has long touted Watson, its AI-powered computer system that answers questions posed to it in natural language. Watson has proven adept in winning at games such as chess and Jeopardy but has not achieved the levels of commercial prominence that IBM stock bulls might have previously hoped.Will IBM’s quantum computing venture follow a similar path? Only time will tell. However, IBM retains a highly profitable core business while being one of the most powerful research and development (R&amp;D) teams in the world. Items such as IBM’s quantum computing arm serve as upside options that could suddenly cause IBM stock to move to a higher valuation.Microsoft (MSFT)Image of corporate building with Microsoft logo above the entrance.Source: NYCStock / Shutterstock.comMicrosoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) used to be known for missing several key technological trends, such as smartphones. However, it’s gotten much better about leading new technological trends. The firm’s early and powerful move into cloud services, with Azure, has been exceptionally successful. And now, Azure itself is giving Microsoft into a beachhead into quantum computing.Microsoft is building a quantum ecosystem within Azure. Both through Microsoft’s own internal products and with its partners, Microsoft offers quantum computing solutions to its customers.This is easier for customers, since they can get access to quantum computing solutions through their existing cloud offering instead of having to get a physical quantum computer. It also creates immense lock-in for Azure in an increasing competitive cloud computing industry.Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (TSM)image of TSM semiconductor office buildingSource: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.comAnother thing we can be sure of is that existing technology leaders won’t take innovation lying down. Taiwan’s government, to that end, announced a $290 million investment plan in 2021 for developing future quantum computing innovations.If quantum computing really takes off, it would threaten Taiwan Semiconductor’s (NYSE:TSM) monopolistic position in current semiconductor manufacturing. So, Taiwan as a nation, and TSM in particular, are understandably investing to keep up with potential competition. It remains to be seen exactly what TSM’s long-term approach to quantum computing will be. But it’s a dominant player in computing technology today and is investing in quantum.Rigetti Computing (RGTI)A concept image showing a quantum computer with a matrix background; quantum computingSource: ShutterstockFor the final two picks, we have pure-play quantum computing stocks. It should be noted from the top that these two are far riskier than anything else on the list. These companies have failed to generate meaningful revenues or fully proven out their business models as of yet.Rigetti (NASDAQ:RGTI), in particular, is one of the two primary special purpose acquisition companies (SPACs) that went to market recently related to quantum computing. Rigetti claims to have some of the most powerful quantum computing technology out there. And it has impressive research partnerships with organizations such as the U.S. Air Force and the Department of Energy.Rigetti only generated $8 million in revenues in 2021, and is expected to bring in $13 million this year. The company is still years shy of reaching a tipping point where it generates substantial commercial demand. However, for pure-play quantum computing stocks, Rigetti is one to watch.IonQ (IONQ)A concept image of a processor representing quantum computing.Source: Amin Van / Shutterstock.comThis is by far the most controversial pick on this list. IonQ (NYSE:IONQ) claims to have “the world’s most powerful quantum computer.” Short seller firm Scorpion Capital, however, called the company a “brazen scam” in an exhaustive 183-page report. For investors that aren’t quantum physicists, it can be hard to evaluate the merits of the company’s technology and the ensuing short seller claims.What we do know is that IonQ has generated scant revenues so far. Even by its own admission, there’s a long path ahead of it before it develops enough qubits to generate substantial commercial demand and finally reach profitability. However, it’s also been easy for short sellers to go after SPACs with unproven business models. Many of Scorpion’s points about the company’s current financials could be correct without invalidating the company’s entire technology.In any case, IONQ stock remains the single largest holding in the Defiance Quantum ETF (NYSEARCA:QTUM) as of the time of writing, despite the controversy. For investors willing to speculate on a high-risk, high-reward quantum computing stock, IONQ stock is certainly cheaper now than it was a year ago.On the date of publication, Ian Bezek held a LONG position in IBM stock.

But we also understand that investors develop their own strategies, so we are constantly looking at the latest trends in value, growth, and momentum to find strong companies for our readers.Looking at the history of these trends, perhaps none is more beloved than value investing. This strategy simply looks to identify companies that are being undervalued by the broader market. Value investors rely on traditional forms of analysis on key valuation metrics to find stocks that they believe are undervalued, leaving room for profits.In addition to the Zacks Rank, investors looking for stocks with specific traits can utilize our Style Scores system. Of course, value investors will be most interested in the system's ""Value"" category. Stocks with ""A"" grades for Value and high Zacks Ranks are among the best value stocks available at any given moment.Marathon Petroleum (MPC) is a stock many investors are watching right now. MPC is currently sporting a Zacks Rank of #1 (Strong Buy) and an A for Value.Investors should also note that MPC holds a PEG ratio of 0.28. This figure is similar to the commonly-used P/E ratio, with the PEG ratio also factoring in a company's expected earnings growth rate. MPC's industry has an average PEG of 0.62 right now. Over the last 12 months, MPC's PEG has been as high as 3.88 and as low as 0.25, with a median of 0.60.Another notable valuation metric for MPC is its P/B ratio of 1.50. Investors use the P/B ratio to look at a stock's market value versus its book value, which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities. This company's current P/B looks solid when compared to its industry's average P/B of 1.76. Over the past year, MPC's P/B has been as high as 2.03 and as low as 1.06, with a median of 1.44.Story continuesAnother great Oil and Gas - Refining and Marketing stock you could consider is Phillips 66 (PSX), which is a # 2 (Buy) stock with a Value Score of A.Phillips 66 is trading at a forward earnings multiple of 6.39 at the moment, with a PEG ratio of 0.52. This compares to its industry's average P/E of 4.84 and average PEG ratio of 0.62.Over the last 12 months, PSX's P/E has been as high as 19.08, as low as 5.86, with a median of 10.49, and its PEG ratio has been as high as 2.40, as low as 0.48, with a median of 0.65.Phillips 66 sports a P/B ratio of 1.58 as well; this compares to its industry's price-to-book ratio of 1.76. In the past 52 weeks, PSX's P/B has been as high as 2.40, as low as 1.45, with a median of 1.71.Value investors will likely look at more than just these metrics, but the above data helps show that Marathon Petroleum and Phillips 66 are likely undervalued currently. And when considering the strength of its earnings outlook, MPC and PSX sticks out as one of the market's strongest value stocks.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

That's far outpacing competitors. Toyota, Stellantis, and Nissan just three of those all reporting a drop during the most recent quarter. Joining us now to talk about the auto sector at large, we want to bring in Karl Brauer. He's iseecars.com executive analyst.Karl, it's great to see you. So we had those four large automakers. Tesla also reporting record deliveries, yet a mixed expectations. And that's a big reason why that stock is selling off today. From your vantage point, from your view, I guess, give us just your assessment on where we stand in the supply chain issues because that is the biggest challenge here for automakers as we enter the final quarter of the year. How much improvement have we seen?KARL BRAUER: We've definitely seen improvement. We're moving in the right direction. We're digging and clawing our way back to having balanced a supply chain process with demand and production so that we're not seeing these big holes and gaps in how many cars they want to produce versus what they can produce. We're not there yet. We're probably going to be another 6 plus months before we get there.The bigger question is, or the longer term question, is the demand side. It's been interesting because we've been on a supply side issue for years. And now we're about to, I think, maybe solve that. And I think maybe in Tesla's case, you're seeing a preview possibly of coming attractions in that supply gets solved just when demand starts to fall off because of global economic concerns.DAVE BRIGGS: Well, on that, then, what does the GM number tell you about demand? And what do you expect from Ford-- I think it's tomorrow.Story continuesKARL BRAUER: Right, well, what GM tells me is that they certainly got a lot of their backlog supply issues filled because they had a lot of cars sitting around that weren't being sold because they had a few pieces or parts missing. And I think they got all those cars cleared out, put into the dealerships, and we saw their inventory numbers grow, and of course, their sales grow tremendously. We know Ford's been suffering the same thing. We've seen these aerial shots of these parking lots just getting full of F-150s.And both companies said they would solve the problem by the end of the year, that all those backlogged cars would go out the door and out to the dealers. So I would expect to see some pretty impressive numbers from Ford and General Motors, Ford tomorrow for Q3 and then both of them probably for Q4. But again, long-term, once we've solved the supply issue, how are we going to be on the demand side?RACHELLE AKUFFO: So then, during this point, you mentioned the ones that are doing well, GM and Ford. Who is in the worst position right now? Who's really getting squeezed the most by these supply chain issues?KARL BRAUER: Well, you know, I saw the Q3 numbers for Honda, and I think they were down 35%. And I know Nissan was down, and Stellantis was down. So and I find it interesting because you would feel like it's a fairly consistent issue on these supplies, but it seems like it's starting to get spotty or certain automakers are coming back quicker than others, and they're benefiting from the slow reproduction and recovery of the supply chain issue.But we're certainly not out of the woods yet. And we saw plenty of other automakers down for Q3, and they're all still down, I think, except Genesis. The luxury division of Honda was the only one that I think, year to date, looked like they were up.SEANA SMITH: Karl, you've mentioned demand a few times. So let's talk a little bit more about it because we have a weakening economy. Consumers are facing higher rates. Any sign yet that demand for cars has started to weaken? And I guess, how do you see that affecting pricing?KARL BRAUER: So we've been tracking at I See Cars, and we still see the average demand as 10%-- sorry, the average price 10% above MSRP. So if you look at all the pricing out there for cars that are listed, the average car is listed 10% above MSRP. And some of them, like Jeeps and Porsches and all, they're like 20%, 25% above MSRP.But when you look at it, you see these are luxury cars and, like, fun cars. So these are consumers that have plenty of money and they just want the car, and they're going to get the car right now. We're at 10% overall. And I think we used to be higher. I think we were well above 10% average a couple of months ago. So we're already seeing this kind of average thing-- we're still above MSRP, which sounds good, but it wasn't-- it's not as strong as it was before in terms of pricing for these cars.And then I think there were signs that, for instance, China's backlog of demand for Tesla had fallen off a little bit. And that's, I think, is why Tesla's stock is hurting. He had a lot of sale-- he had a lot of production this quarter, but he didn't have sales that were close to his production numbers, and he usually does. So once we start getting into an issue where there's a demand thing, that's much harder to navigate. Elon has done a great job in navigating this supply chain issue for the last two years. How does he navigate a demand issue if that starts to crop up?DAVE BRIGGS: Oh, so much for that Jeep I wanted, Karl. When it comes to the used market, what did we learn from CarMax? When they got hit, sales were down 6 and 1/2%. Their CEO saying the consumer looked to be hit by affordability. What have we learned there? Well,KARL BRAUER: I think used car buyers are going to be much more price sensitive. OK, used car buyers, they're not going to be the wealthy. They're not going to be the ones buying the Corvettes and the Broncos and the Gladiators because they've got plenty of money. So they're kind of an early indicator here. And if they're falling off because they're not going to invest in a new car now-- they've decided to hold off on a big purchase-- that would suggest all the things we're seeing related to the global economy in general on the horizon.RACHELLE AKUFFO: So Karl, when we look at things like affordability, what consumers are willing to spend on, is there a sweet spot right now in terms of the kinds of models that consumers want to buy?KARL BRAUER: They've always wanted flexibility. And that's why SUVs have become so popular over the last 10 plus years, is the idea that one car can serve so many different purposes. So you're still going to always have that SUV flexibility be one of the focuses of consumer demand. And that's why so many car companies have switched generally toward SUVs versus cars.But it also means that if you're able to buy without getting an SUV, if you can get by with a sedan, you've got a much better chance of getting a nice price. If you're willing to go buy a midsize or small sedan right now, you get a much better price versus an SUV, which everyone wants.DAVE BRIGGS: A lot of questions lie ahead. Karl Brauer, good to see you. Thanks so much.]"

Bolt sales are down 11% for the first nine months of the year versus the same period last year.In June, GM said it would sharply cut Bolt prices after it halted sales for six months following a battery recall.GM will boost Bolt production for global markets to more than 70,000 in 2023 from about 44,000 vehicles this year, it said on Monday. Bolt sales in 2021 hit a record annual high of 24,828 vehicles.The largest U.S. automaker said it was moving up body shop upgrades at its Detroit Factory ZERO for Silverado EV production in 2023 and taking other steps to prepare.GM will pause production of the GMC HUMMER EV Pickup for several weeks starting in late November to prepare for that production jump, it said.Cadillac Lyriq production will increase in the fourth quarter and GM plans additional production shifts for GMC Hummer EVs in 2023, it said.The automaker reiterated its 2023 EV launches, including the Chevrolet Silverado EV, Chevrolet Blazer EV and Chevrolet Equinox EV, were on schedule.GM's EV sales are still a small fraction of U.S. sales. Out of 1.65 million U.S. vehicles sold in the first nine months of the year, GM sold 22,012 Bolts, 782 Hummer EV pickups and 36 Lyriq SUVs.GM and LG Energy Solution's joint venture Ultium Cells LLC is considering a site in Indiana for a fourth $2.4 billion U.S. battery cell manufacturing plant, the venture said in August.The St. Joseph County Council last week approved a tax abatement for the proposed 2.5-million square foot factory plant in New Carlisle.

This often involves substituting sugar and salt for a variety of different spices, particularly hotter and exotic flavors. This has historically led to strong increases in spice sales for the company.Founded in 1889, the company is expected to generate $6.5 billion in revenue this year and currently has a market capitalization of $19 billion.Financial reviewIn September, McCormick reported preliminary operating results for the quarter ending Aug. 31. Sales are expected to increase 6% on a constant currency basis with strength in both the Consumer and Flavor Solutions segments. Adjusted operating income is expected to be $226 million compared to $272 million in prior-year period. Earnings per share is expected to be 65 cents compared to 80 cents a year ago. The company is not immune from supply chain issues, inflationary costs and slowed demand.""During the third quarter, supply chain challenges continued, and supply recovery of certain constrained materials has taken longer than expected,"" Chairman, President and CEO Lawrence Kurzius said. ""We also continued to incur elevated costs to meet high demand in some parts of our business, while in other parts of our business, where demand has moderated, we are experiencing lower operating leverage. Across the supply chain, managing inventory levels and eliminating inefficiencies have been a focus. Overall, the normalization of our supply chain costs is taking longer than expected, pressuring gross margin. Over the coming months, we will be aggressively driving the elimination of supply chain inefficiencies.""Story continuesAs of the last balance sheet reporting date, the company had $325.8 million in cash and total debt of $5.4 billion. With $1.3 billion in Ebitda expected this year, the companys leverage ratio is above average at approximately 3.8 times.McCormick Is Facing HeadwindsValuationThe company recently provided updated 2022 earnings per share guidance, which is expected to be in the range of $2.63 to $2.68, as compared to previously reported guidance of $3.03 to $3.08 and adjusted earnings per share of $3.05 in 2021. Consensus analyst EPS estimates for the fiscal year ending November 2022 are $2.65.The companys valuation levels appear to be elevated even when using forward looking earning per share next year as the company returns to more normalized margins. A ratio of 25 times forward earnings per share and a estimated enerprise value-Ebitd ratio of 19 times makes for an expensive stock.The GuruFocus discounted cash flow creates a value of $52 using next year's estimates of $2.90 and a 10% long-term growth rate. The company pays an annualized cash dividend of $1.48, which equates to a 2.08% dividend yield.Guru tradesGurus who have purchased McCormick stock recently include Mario Gabelli (Trades, Portfolio) and Joel Greenblatt (Trades, Portfolio).ConclusionMajor potential challenges still exist for the company, including slower-than-expected category growth, increased private label penetration, inability to pay down total debt and disruption of operations from the implementation of a new enterprise resource planning system.McCormick is an iconic company with a storied history and continued potential for strong growth. The current headwinds of inflation, supply chain issues and geopolitical conflict may prove to be temporary. However, the high valuation levels still make it tough to create a margin of safety at current price levels. A lower entry point may be warranted for investors.This article first appeared on GuruFocus.]"

Kellogg also continues to expand its acquired brands through new product introductions.Several other companies in the food space, like The Kraft Heinz Company KHC, Hormel Foods Corporation HRL and McCormick &amp; Company, Incorporated MKC, are benefiting from acquisitions.In April 2022, Kraft Heinz acquired a majority stake in a Brazil-based condiments and sauces company — Companhia Hemmer Industria e Comercio (""Hemmer""). The buyout has widened Kraft Heinz's International Taste Elevation platform and enhanced its presence across emerging markets. In January 2022, KHC acquired an 85% stake in Germany-based Just Spices GmbH (“Just Spices”). The buyout enhanced its direct-to-consumer operations and go-to-market expansion.Hormel Foods is strengthening its business through strategic acquisitions. In June, HRL acquired the Planters snacking portfolio from Kraft Heinz. Prior to this, it acquired Texas-based pit-smoked meats company Sadler's Smokehouse in March 2020. The buyout was in sync with Hormel Foods’ initiatives to strengthen its position in the foodservice space.McCormick has strategically increased its presence through acquisitions and strengthened its portfolio. In December 2020, MKC bought a 100% stake in FONA International, LLC and some of its affiliates. FONA’s diverse portfolio helps McCormick bolster its value-add offerings and expand the flavor solutions segment into attractive categories. In November 2020, McCormick acquired the parent company of Cholula Hot Sauce — a premium Mexico-based hot sauce brand.Story continuesSolid Brands Aid KelloggMeanwhile, Kellogg’s portfolio consists of strong brands such as Pringles, RXBAR, Bear Naked, Cheez-It and Rice Krispies Treats, among many others. The company’s frozen foods brands like Morningstar Farms and Eggo have also been aiding growth. In its second-quarter 2022 earnings call, management highlighted that its world-class snacks brands continued to deliver robust performance across markets worldwide during the ongoing year.Kellogg is augmenting its portfolio by adding more products under existing brands, innovation and marketing initiatives. The company is focused on investing in brand-building efforts. K invests in digital media, consumer promotions and traditional advertising. Kellogg has also been enhancing its in-store capabilities — like increasing the sales force of its struggling businesses.We believe that such upsides coupled with a prudent acquisition strategy will likely keep Kellogg well positioned in the food space.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

197,91ac6a7f-5d2c-39dd-a467-542ef9a1c4c7,PNC,2022-10-04,Community Benefits Plan Six Month Update: PNC's $88 Billion Commitment Comes to Life,ACCESSWIRE,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/community-benefits-plan-six-month-121500446.html,1664885700,STORY,['PNC'],"[NORTHAMPTON, MA / ACCESSWIRE / October 4, 2022 / Under the Community Benefits Plan started Jan. 1, 2022, The PNC Financial Services Group allotted $47 billion in financing for residential mortgage and home equity lending, $26.5 billion in small business loans, $14.5 billion for community financing loans and investments, and an additional $500 million in charitable giving over a four-year period beginning in 2022. Six months into its ambitious plan, PNC has deployed nearly $17.4 billion* in capital to advance economic opportunities for low and moderate-income (LMI) individuals, communities and people of color.$13.3 Billion to Expand Homeownership, Economic MobilityAccess to affordable housing and the ability to purchase a home are foundational to economic prosperity and the building of generational wealth. Central to PNC's efforts to boost homeownership among people and communities of color is its ongoing commitment to offer an expanded first-time homebuyer grant program, dedicated credit assistance and $47 billion in home loans.To support this expansive homeownership goal and to address some of the unique lending and credit needs of minority borrowers and unbanked or underbanked homebuyers, PNC has increased the number of Affordable Lending Minority Loan Officers (MLO) focused on affordable home lending from 8 to 39, with plans to hire and retain additional diverse banking officers by year end.The Affordable Lending group also expects to increase its first-time homebuyer down-payment grant assistance to help reach more underserved residents and communities. The first-time homebuyer grants help qualified borrowers cover down payment and closings costs fees.And PNC's efforts to increase economic inclusion and generational wealth building are making a difference across markets. In the first six months, PNC's Community Benefits Plan totaled $13.3 billion in residential mortgage and home equity loans, impacting more than 11,000 LMI and minority borrowers.Story continues$2.7 Billion to Advance Small Business and Empower Entrepreneurs Small businesses are the lifeblood of the U.S. economy. PNC's Plan builds on our existing commitment to boost small business growth with $26.5 billion in loans and equity investments dedicated to supporting business development and minority entrepreneurs in LMI neighborhoods coast to coast.In Baltimore, for example, we've committed $3 million in low-cost capital to Baltimore Community Lending (BCL), a Community Development Financial Institution (CDFI) dedicated to revitalizing Baltimore's underinvested neighborhood. BCL offers flexible financial assistance to small business owners and real estate developers who commit to building impactful community development projects throughout the city.Beyond expanded investment into minority and community lenders, PNC also continues to help address the challenges of building a small business with the launch of the Minority Business Development Group, a Business Banking resource team dedicated to developing and accelerating minority-owned businesses.PNC's corporate, small business and retail banking groups have worked together to deploy $2.7 billion in lending and investments to support small businesses (those generating less than $1M in annual revenues) and owners and operators in communities of color.$1.33 Billion Supports Community Revitalization and Economic Development PNC is also accelerating investments in affordable rental housing and economic revitalization initiatives in LMI neighborhoods and communities of color. In 2022, we continue to create more economic equity and inclusion in our communities by delivering nearly $1.33 billion of the $14.5 billion in equity and debt investments and loans allocated under the Plan to support community development and revitalization initiatives.PNC Tax Credit Solutions is devoted to preserving and bolstering affordable housing supply and spurring economic development. The dedicated business invests long-term capital into projects that address critical infrastructure needs in LMI communities, such as housing, job creation and business development. As an industry leader, PNC Tax Credit Solutions invests in, sponsors, and syndicates funds investing in Low Income Housing Tax Credits (LIHTC), New Markets Tax Credits (NMTC), Historic Tax Credits (HTC) and affordable housing preservation projects.Through a combination of Historic Tax Credits and New Markets Tax Credit equity investments, PNC Tax Credit Solutions business is helping developers in Toledo, Ohio transform a vacant U.S. Postal Service office downtown into the Toledo Innovation Center, a 106,000 square foot technology training center and shared office workspace.Set to open in 2023, the renovated and renamed Toledo Innovation Center will offer low-income residents training and paid apprenticeships in technology technology-focused industries. The development also will provide entrepreneurs with open workspace to launch or expand their businesses. Over the next seven years, the project's developers expect to create more than 2,000 jobs in technical careers and generate more than $20 million in annual payroll revenue.In Wheeling, WV, developer Woda Cooper Companies, Inc. tapped into PNC's extensive experience blending equity investment and lending products to help bring a new four-story, 46-unit rental complex downtown. PNC's Community Development Banking group provided more than $6 million in Opportunity Zone equity financing and construction lending to help fund The Doris on Main. With completion expected in mid-2023, the multifamily apartment development will expand housing options affordable to working families and residents downtown and help drive retail and restaurant growth in surrounding, underinvested communities.Expanded Access to Products and ServicesTo help reach its goal of providing expanded access to PNC's products and services, the bank recently opened four branches and expanded its fleet of mobile branches to reach lower-income families in unbanked or under-resourced areas, where residents often rely on payday lenders and other high-cost resources for financial support. To date, PNC has 11 mobile branches serving communities across the country, with additional fleet expansion expected by year end.In addition to introducing expanded services under the Plan, PNC has continued to make significant strides in delivering responsible retail banking products to help customers reduce or eliminate taxing or excessive bank fees. As part of a larger effort to help customers navigate and avoid over draft fees, PNC offers Low Cash Mode®. Additionally, PNC recently eliminated non-sufficient (NSF) fees and expanded customer access to more than 41,000 surcharge-free ATMs.Creating Impact for CommunitiesOriginally announced in Oct 2020 as a $1 billion pledge to help challenge systemic racism, PNC's initiative to advance economic opportunity and entrepreneurship in Black and Brown communities has grown to $1.5 billion in grants and investments. In 2021, the PNC Foundation seeded the launch of The Howard University and PNC National Center for Entrepreneurship, with the goal of providing capacity-building resources, research and entrepreneurship education to the nation's network of 101 historically Black colleges and universities.Since January, PNC has worked to invest in meaningful collaborations with several HBCUs and will continue to provide expanded capital and resources to help empower LMI communities as well as people and communities of color.What's NextAs we continue our efforts to bring the Community Benefits Plan to life in our communities, we're also launching several market-driven initiatives throughout 2022 to promote actionable and accountable community engagement and investment.Community Advisory Council - PNC has established an inaugural Community Advisory Council to help support execution of the Plan and provide insight into market-specific community issues. Comprised of seasoned community and economic development leaders from across PNC's markets, the Community Advisory Council meets semi-annually to provide ongoing oversight and invaluable feedback to help ensure PNC continues to implement impactful investment and lending initiatives in the communities we serve.Community Leadership Symposium - PNC is committed to bolstering economic opportunity for low-and moderate-income communities by introducing new, actionable insights and evidence to the field. As part of this commitment, in collaboration with Urban Institute, PNC will host a best-in class annual Community Leadership Symposium. This annual event will be comprised of think tanks, community advocates, and industry experts representing community development across the US footprint and will be scheduled to take place in Pittsburgh, PA.Blueprint for Opportunity - We rely on market leadership, and the expertise of advocates in the communities to guide PNC's efforts to bring empowering resources and transformative investments to the people and communities we serve. Moving forward, through a series of market-based initiatives, we're launching a comprehensive engagement campaign to share how we impact the individual communities we serve.*As of June 30, 2022. PNC's ability to meet the defined CBP goals within the applicable time period is subject to market conditions, regulatory conditions as well as other risks, uncertainties and external factors which may fall outside of the company's control.View additional multimedia and more ESG storytelling from PNC Financial Services Group on 3blmedia.com.Contact Info:Spokesperson: PNC Financial Services GroupWebsite: https://www.pnc.com/en/personal-banking.htmlEmail: info@3blmedia.comSOURCE: PNC Financial Services GroupView source version on accesswire.com: https://www.accesswire.com/718729/Community-Benefits-Plan-Six-Month-Update-PNCs-88-Billion-Commitment-Comes-to-Life]"

So, you might want to look at some of the facts that could shape the stock's performance in the near term.Shares of this retailer have returned -9.9% over the past month versus the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's -9.2% change. The Zacks Retail - Discount Stores industry, to which Target belongs, has lost 5.9% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?Although media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.Revisions to Earnings EstimatesHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.We essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.Target is expected to post earnings of $2.14 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -29.4%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -0.1%.The consensus earnings estimate of $8.11 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of -40.2%. This estimate has changed -0.1% over the last 30 days.For the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $12.06 indicates a change of +48.7% from what Target is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -0.1%.Story continuesHaving a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, Target is rated Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPS12-month consensus EPS estimate for TGT _12MonthEPSChartUrlProjected Revenue GrowthWhile earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.For Target, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $26.37 billion indicates a year-over-year change of +2.8%. For the current and next fiscal years, $109.8 billion and $113.73 billion estimates indicate +3.6% and +3.6% changes, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryTarget reported revenues of $26.04 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +3.5%. EPS of $0.39 for the same period compares with $3.64 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $26.16 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of -0.47%. The EPS surprise was -45.07%.Over the last four quarters, Target surpassed consensus EPS estimates two times. The company topped consensus revenue estimates two times over this period.ValuationWithout considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.Comparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.The Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.Target is graded B on this front, indicating that it is trading at a discount to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.Bottom LineThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Target. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

(NASDAQ:ISRG) Trading At A 30% Discount?",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/intuitive-surgical-inc-nasdaq-isrg-110025434.html,1664881225.0,STORY,['ISRG'],"[In this article we are going to estimate the intrinsic value of Intuitive Surgical, Inc. (NASDAQ:ISRG) by projecting its future cash flows and then discounting them to today's value. One way to achieve this is by employing the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model. Before you think you won't be able to understand it, just read on! It's actually much less complex than you'd imagine.We would caution that there are many ways of valuing a company and, like the DCF, each technique has advantages and disadvantages in certain scenarios. If you want to learn more about discounted cash flow, the rationale behind this calculation can be read in detail in the Simply Wall St analysis model. See our latest analysis for Intuitive Surgical The ModelWe use what is known as a 2-stage model, which simply means we have two different periods of growth rates for the company's cash flows. Generally the first stage is higher growth, and the second stage is a lower growth phase. In the first stage we need to estimate the cash flows to the business over the next ten years. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.A DCF is all about the idea that a dollar in the future is less valuable than a dollar today, so we discount the value of these future cash flows to their estimated value in today's dollars:10-year free cash flow (FCF) estimate2023202420252026202720282029203020312032 Levered FCF ($, Millions) US$2.33bUS$2.72bUS$3.14bUS$3.52bUS$3.80bUS$4.04bUS$4.23bUS$4.40bUS$4.55bUS$4.68bGrowth Rate Estimate SourceAnalyst x4Analyst x4Analyst x1Analyst x1Est @ 7.93%Est @ 6.13%Est @ 4.87%Est @ 3.99%Est @ 3.38%Est @ 2.95% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 5.7% US$2.2kUS$2.4kUS$2.7kUS$2.8kUS$2.9kUS$2.9kUS$2.9kUS$2.8kUS$2.8kUS$2.7k(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$27bStory continuesWe now need to calculate the Terminal Value, which accounts for all the future cash flows after this ten year period. For a number of reasons a very conservative growth rate is used that cannot exceed that of a country's GDP growth. In this case we have used the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield (1.9%) to estimate future growth. In the same way as with the 10-year 'growth' period, we discount future cash flows to today's value, using a cost of equity of 5.7%.Terminal Value (TV)= FCF2032 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$4.7b× (1 + 1.9%) ÷ (5.7%– 1.9%) = US$126bPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$126b÷ ( 1 + 5.7%)10= US$72bThe total value is the sum of cash flows for the next ten years plus the discounted terminal value, which results in the Total Equity Value, which in this case is US$99b. In the final step we divide the equity value by the number of shares outstanding. Relative to the current share price of US$193, the company appears quite good value at a 30% discount to where the stock price trades currently. The assumptions in any calculation have a big impact on the valuation, so it is better to view this as a rough estimate, not precise down to the last cent.dcfThe AssumptionsWe would point out that the most important inputs to a discounted cash flow are the discount rate and of course the actual cash flows. If you don't agree with these result, have a go at the calculation yourself and play with the assumptions. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Intuitive Surgical as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 5.7%, which is based on a levered beta of 0.893. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.Moving On:Although the valuation of a company is important, it is only one of many factors that you need to assess for a company. It's not possible to obtain a foolproof valuation with a DCF model. Rather it should be seen as a guide to ""what assumptions need to be true for this stock to be under/overvalued?"" For instance, if the terminal value growth rate is adjusted slightly, it can dramatically alter the overall result. Why is the intrinsic value higher than the current share price?

207,047c71f9-0455-37bc-a864-cbadfa719f7d,CSX,2022-10-04,Norfolk Southern (NSC) Strong on Dividends Despite Cost Woes,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/norfolk-southern-nsc-strong-dividends-150003013.html,1664809203,STORY,"['NSC', 'CSX', 'UNP']","[Norfolk Southern’s NSC efforts to reward its shareholders through dividends and buybacks are encouraging. However, high fuel costs are concerning as the same is limiting bottom-line growth.Factors Favoring NSCWe are impressed with Norfolk Southern's efforts to reward its shareholders through dividends and buybacks. In January 2022, NSC’s board announced a 14% increase in its quarterly dividend payout, taking the total to $1.24 per share. This was the third dividend hike approval in a year’s time.A strong free cash flow generating ability supports NSC's shareholder-friendly activities. In 2021, Norfolk Southern generated a free cash flow of $2,785 million, up 30% year over year. In first-half 2022, free cash flow was $1,174 million.Driven by strong freight demand, revenues are likely to have been impressive in third-quarter 2022. Owing to upbeat revenues, operating ratio (operating expenses as a percentage of revenues) is likely to have improved year over year in the September quarter.Key RisksFuel expenses represent a key input cost for any transportation player, and Norfolk Southern is no exception. The current scenario of increasing fuel costs does not bode well as far as bottom-line growth is concerned. At NSC, fuel costs surged 94% year over year in first-half 2022, inducing a 17% rise in operating costs.Norfolk Southern is also being hurt by headwinds like supply-chain disruptions and slower network velocity. Due to these headwinds, overall volumes declined 3% year over year in the June quarter. Volumes contracted in first-quarter 2022 as well.High Fuel Costs a Bane for Other Railroads TooThanks to the northward movement in oil price (up 48% in first-half 2022) induced by the Russia-Ukraine war, fuel expenses are on the rise, hurting bottom-line growth of not only Norfolk Southern but other railroads like Union Pacific Corporation UNP and CSX Corporation CSX as well.At Union Pacific, fuel expenses escalated 82% in first-half 2022, causing a 20% jump in operating costs. The increase in operating costs affected the key efficiency metric of operating ratio (operating expenses as a % of revenues) to the tune of 130 basis points in the June quarter.Story continuesFuel costs are likely to be high in the September quarter as well. Results will be out on Oct 20. High capital expenditures may also be a downside as far as Union Pacific’s bottom line is concerned in the third quarter.At CSX, operating expenses increased 41% year over year in first-half 2022, mainly due to the 102% rise in fuel expenses. The increase in fuel costs was due to the steep rise in highway diesel fuel prices and the addition of non-locomotive fuel used for trucking. Costs are likely to be high in the September quarter too. Detailed results will be out on Oct 20.Like UNP, capital expenditures are high at CSX. In 2021, CSX’s capital expenditures were $1.79 billion, higher than $1.63 billion in 2020.  For 2022, CSX expects capital expenditures to increase to approximately $2 billion. High capex may also hurt CSX’s free cash flow-generating ability.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research? Today, you can download 7 Best Stocks for the Next 30 Days.

However, CNN Travel expects a meaningfully smoother sail for cruises ahead. According to the top global cruise industry trade group, Cruise Lines International Association (CLIA), over 75% of its member ships have resumed their services, with almost all of its cruise ships expected to be sailing by late summer.CLIA projects passenger metrics to surpass the pre-pandemic levels by the end of 2023. Similarly, according to Cruise Industry News, about 40 new ships are expected to hit the market this year, and more than 75 vessels have already been ordered through 2027. In late April, Colleen McDaniel, editor-in-chief of leading cruise review website Cruise Critic, said: ""We're seeing shoppers and cruise bookings increase week after week, which is fantastic news for the industry.""In November 2021, CLIA's member cruise lines announced that they will become carbon neutral by 2050, in line with the United Nations' net-zero global emissions goal. In order to achieve zero carbon, the cruise industry is gradually moving towards reducing emissions via shore-power connectivity, which means enabling ships to switch off their engines and plug in at ports. CLIA will have 174 ships with shore-power connectivity by 2027, however, only about 14 global ports presently provide the connectivity infrastructure. The demand in the cruise sector can potentially weather the inflationary headwinds, and investors who would like to get in on the action can buy stocks like Marriott International, Inc. (NASDAQ:MAR), Expedia Group, Inc. (NASDAQ:EXPE), and Booking Holdings Inc.

Say nothing of aggressive growth stocks. Companies that were growing revenue at the expense of profits saw their shares tank as investors braced for higher interest rates and fled to the relative safety of value stocks.Yet, bear markets don’t last forever. And aggressive growth stocks have an important role to play in almost every portfolio. Companies with strong track records of growth and innovation tend to deliver higher returns, albeit with higher risk.With the S&amp;P 500 up about 10% from its bear market low, made just two weeks ago, it appears many investors have gotten their appetite for risk back. If you’re one of them, here are three aggressive growth stocks to buy now.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsPLTRPalantir Technologies$8.57MELIMercadoLibre$833.36SHOPShopify$29.06Palantir Technologies (PLTR)Palantir (PLTR) logo on data network background, imaginary location in the futureSource: Spyro the Dragon / Shutterstock.comShares of big data analytics company Palantir Technologies (NYSE:PLTR) are down 66% over the past year, mainly due to concerns about its slowing growth, lack of profitability and the broader tech wreck.In early August, PLTR stock sold off following the release of the company’s second-quarter results. Revenue rose 26% to $473 million, which was in line with expectations. However, management’s full-year sales and profit forecast disappointed the Street. For 2022, Palantir estimates it will see adjusted income of about $342 million on revenue of about $1.9 billion. This was well below the $527.9 million in adjusted income and $1.98 billion in revenue analysts were expecting.However, Palantir did see its commercial revenue increase 46% year over year in the second quarter. U.S. commercial revenue growth was even more impressive, rising 120% from a year ago, as the company saw its U.S. customer count jump to 119, up from 34 clients in the second quarter of 2021.Palantir’s customer count will continue to rise as more companies look to benefit from the insights gleaned by data analytics. Most recently, Palantir inked a multiyear partnership with Hertz (NASDAQ:HTZ). Palantir will create a platform for the car rental company to help it manage and operate its fleet more efficiently.Story continuesWhile PLTR stock has lost two-thirds of its value in the past 12 months, shares are up 33% from their 52-week low, made in May. Given Palantir’s excellent growth prospects, investors should take advantage of the opportunity to buy the dip.MercadoLibre (MELI)mercado libre boxSource: tiagogarciafoto / Shutterstock.comMercadoLibre (NASDAQ:MELI) is one of the leading online retailers in the rapidly growing Latin American market. According to Statista, e-commerce sales in Latin America are estimated to rise from around $85 billion in 202o to $160 billion in 2025. That’s a compound annual growth rate of 13.5%. With its massive user base of roughly 140 million people as of last year and its user-friendly interface, MercadoLibre is positioned to capitalize.The company’s network of online storefronts provides entrepreneurs and businesses with an easy and affordable way to reach new customers. And with its digital payments company Mercado Pago at its core, MercadoLibre can manage payments effectively. In short, MercadoLibre has all the tools it needs to continue dominating the Latin American e-commerce market.Revenue rose 52% in the second quarter on a year-over-year basis and net income surged 81% to $123 million, driven by robust growth in both its e-commerce and digital payments businesses. Analysts are calling for revenue growth of 47% this year and 26% next year. Meanwhile, they are forecasting earnings per share will increase by 306% in 2022 and 58% in 2023.MELI stock is down 44% over the past year. Yet, shares are trading 39% above their 52-week low, made in mid-June. Investors clearly are coming back around to this long-term growth play.Shopify (SHOP)Shopify (SHOP) logo on a smartphone which is next to a miniature shopping cart and miniature cardboard boxesSource: Burdun Iliya / Shutterstock.comShares of e-commerce platform Shopify (NYSE:SHOP) have been clobbered over the past year, falling 80%. Yet, the company remains a leader in a high-growth space and could deliver outsized returns when investors start rewarding growth once again. According to Statista, global e-commerce sales will hit $8.1 trillion by 2026, up 56% from last year.Much like Palantir, investors have punished Shopify for its slowing growth rates. Revenue growth, which was 86% in 2020 and 57% in 2021, is expected to be around 23% this year and next.That said, Shopify remains a dominant player in the e-commerce space, as it adapts and evolves in response to changing trends and market conditions. With strong management, innovative technologies and a proven track record of success, Shopify should be able to weather this difficult period.Shares have already bounced 23% from their 52-week low, made in mid-October, but there’s still time to get into this aggressive growth stock.On the publication date, Faizan Farooque did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

213,73a93671-111e-32e3-b136-b81e97f79887,RF,2022-10-04,Fee Income Growth Aids UMB Financial (UMBF) Amid High Costs,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/fee-income-growth-aids-umb-141402743.html,1664806442,STORY,"['UMBF', 'RF-PC', 'WBS']","[UMB Financial Corporation UMBF has been focusing on diversifying operations to non-interest sources of revenues. An improving lending scenario and a favorable interest-rate environment are expected to boost its margins, going forward.However, escalating expenses are concerning for UMB Financial, limiting bottom-line expansion. Limited liquidity is another headwind.Analysts do not seem optimistic regarding the company’s earnings growth potential. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for UMBF’s current-year earnings was unrevised over the last 60 days.The Fed’s aggressive monetary policy stance to tame inflation will support the net interest income (NII) of banks, including Webster Financial Corporation WBS and Regions Financial Corporation RF. Notably, banks have been reeling under near-zero interest rates since March 2020, which adversely impacted net interest margin (NIM) and NII.Regions Financial’s NII witnessed a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 2.5% over the last five years (2017-2021) and increased in the first half of 2022. This has likely been supported by its solid loan growth trend and rising rates.WBS’ NII witnessed a CAGR of 3.1% over the last five years (2017-2021) with some annual volatility. The metric witnessed a rising trend in the first half of 2022. Also, the trend is likely to continue on a decent economic scenario and higher rates.Coming to UMBF’s operating fundamentals, the company’s NII witnessed a CAGR of 10.1% over the last four years (ended 2021) and the rising trend continued in the first half of 2022. Rising rates will further support NII in the upcoming period.It witnessed impressive net loan growth in the last five years (2017-2021), seeing a CAGR of 11%. Also, deposits saw a CAGR of 28% in the last four years ended 2021. Although net loans witnessed a rising trend in the first half, deposits saw a decline. Going forward, strong commercial real estate, and commercial and industrial loan demand are likely to remain decent.Story continuesFee income saw a CAGR of 5.2% for the four-year period ended 2021. In the first half of 2022, the metric witnessed an increasing trend. UMBF’s investment in revenue-producing capabilities is likely to support growth. Going forward, revenues from diverse lines of business and verticals will keep aiding UMB Financial to provide a natural hedge against lower rate environments.The company’s capital deployment plan reflects its ability to keep enhancing shareholder value. UMBF has been raising dividends annually regularly since 2002, with the latest hike of 15.6% announced in July 2021. Also, the bank has a share repurchase plan in place. In April 2022, the company approved a share-repurchase program of up to two million shares, valid until April 2023.However, non-interest expenses flared up, seeing a CAGR of 5.1% over the last four years (2018-2021). The company witnessed a rising trend in non-interest expenses in the first half of 2022. Expenses are likely to remain elevated due to the company’s investments in newer technologies, higher administrative expenses and fraud losses as card use increases.As of Jun 30, 2022, UMB Financial had a total debt of $2.93 billion, which was volatile for the last several quarters. Cash and due from banks of $360.2 million witnessed a downward trend over the same period. Given such a high debt burden, the company does not seem to be well-placed in terms of its liquidity profile. Therefore, it may not be able to continue meeting its debt obligations if the economic situation worsens.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

""I had a chip on my shoulder that came out in destructive ways.""Witherspoon's path of destruction led to trouble with drugs, the abandonment of a Division 1 football scholarship at Bowling Green State University (his father's alma mater), and an assault charge during a stint in the Navy that threatened to put Witherspoon away.""We just want to do what we do well and help people understand what their potential is.""Larry Witherspoon""By the grace of God, the charge just disappeared and gave me a new lease on life,"" Witherspoon said. ""I knew if I was going to continue down that path, I was going to end up in jail or dead. I wanted to make a change and live a life of positivity and leave all that behind me.""Witherspoon went back to college, got his degree, and eventually moved to South Atlanta, where he kept meeting neighbors who reminded him of his younger self. It awakened a part him that he had resented and resisted-the legacy of his dad.""This feeling of what my father had done for young people really came up for me,"" Witherspoon said. ""I was like, ‘I have to do something here to make a change.'""Witherspoon discovered his neighbor, Shawn McHargue, shared that dream. In 2014, Witherspoon and McHargue founded Automotive Training Center (ATC), a nonprofit that provides young men and women the technical training needed to obtain employment in the automotive repair industry. ATC students work on real customer vehicles and are guaranteed employment at one of more than 20 transportation and automotive industry partners across Atlanta.Story continuesMore than 200 students have graduated from ATC in the past eight years.Beyond his pride in those results, Witherspoon is proud that his father became the model for his life's work.""In addition to being a high school principal, my dad coached multiple high school sports and worked part-time at a youth detention center,"" Witherspoon recounted. ""I grew up with that mark on me. I just didn't know it at the time.""We just want to do what we do well and help people understand what their potential is. It may not even be in automotive. You can come here; you can learn to solve complex problems. You can use that in any area of your life.""Automotive Training Center is changing lives, and Regions Bank and the Regions Foundation are supporting ATC's mission.

However, CNN Travel expects a meaningfully smoother sail for cruises ahead. According to the top global cruise industry trade group, Cruise Lines International Association (CLIA), over 75% of its member ships have resumed their services, with almost all of its cruise ships expected to be sailing by late summer.CLIA projects passenger metrics to surpass the pre-pandemic levels by the end of 2023. Similarly, according to Cruise Industry News, about 40 new ships are expected to hit the market this year, and more than 75 vessels have already been ordered through 2027. In late April, Colleen McDaniel, editor-in-chief of leading cruise review website Cruise Critic, said: ""We're seeing shoppers and cruise bookings increase week after week, which is fantastic news for the industry.""In November 2021, CLIA's member cruise lines announced that they will become carbon neutral by 2050, in line with the United Nations' net-zero global emissions goal. In order to achieve zero carbon, the cruise industry is gradually moving towards reducing emissions via shore-power connectivity, which means enabling ships to switch off their engines and plug in at ports. CLIA will have 174 ships with shore-power connectivity by 2027, however, only about 14 global ports presently provide the connectivity infrastructure. The demand in the cruise sector can potentially weather the inflationary headwinds, and investors who would like to get in on the action can buy stocks like Marriott International, Inc. (NASDAQ:MAR), Expedia Group, Inc. (NASDAQ:EXPE), and Booking Holdings Inc.

The metric accounted for 33% of the total revenues compared with 24% in second-quarter fiscal 2019.

It noted that nearly 40% of next-day orders were picked up from Rack stores during the anniversary sale.As part of its closer-to-you strategy, the company aims to link stores and services to expedite deliveries, expand online offerings, and add cheaper merchandise at its Rack off-price stores to improve customers’ shopping experiences. It is also on track to integrate Nordstrom Rack assets and offer a wide range of price points offered at Nordstrom Rack. Increased focus on distribution capabilities, along with improved connectivity of physical and digital inventory, is likely to contribute to Nordstrom Rack sales by $2 billion in the long term.Management envisions its digital unit to account for 50% of the total sales. Apart from these, a rise in new customers, enhanced personalization and expanded product offering are expected to aid revenue growth, profit margin and cash flow generation.Headwinds to OvercomeDespite such upsides, Nordstrom slashed its fiscal 2022 view on declining discretionary spending stemming from inflation. The company expects total year-over-year revenue growth of 5-7%, down from the aforementioned 6-8% rise. Adjusted earnings are envisioned to be $2.30-$2.60, which compares unfavorably with the prior stated $3.20-$3.50. The EBIT margin is likely to be 4.5-4.9%, down from the earlier mentioned 5.8-6.2%. Adjusted EBIT is expected to be 4.3-4.7%, down from the prior stated 5.6-6%.For fiscal 2022, the gross profit is envisioned to remain flat year over year. Also, clearance activity and higher markdowns are likely to affect the gross profit by $200 million.For the fiscal third quarter, it expects a mid-single-digit decline in revenues, as evident from the demand deceleration seen in the latter part of the second quarter. Also, the EBIT margin is likely to be down 200 bps year over year.The company has been witnessing sluggish demand due to rising inflation. It expects a competitive promotional environment in retail in the second half of fiscal 2022. As a result, it has been making efforts to clear excess inventory by the end of fiscal 2022. The move is likely to hurt margins to some extent in the near term.Wrapping UpWe hope that despite sluggish demand and inflationary pressure, Nordstrom will stay afloat, driven by strong demand, a solid online show and a long-term growth strategy.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Reduced retail and consumer demand are weighing on the Tools &amp; Outdoor segment’s performance. The company expects Tools &amp; Outdoor organic revenues to decline mid-to-high single digits in 2022. Margins are expected to decrease year over year in the current year.Stanley Black has operations in multiple nations. Such business diversifications expose it to risks from unfavorable movements in foreign currencies, geopolitical issues and other headwinds. In second-quarter 2022, foreign currency translation had a negative impact of 2% on sales.Stanley Black has been struggling with supply chain disruptions and logistics cost inflation. Escalating cost of sales (due to raw material cost inflation) and selling, general and administrative expenses pose a threat to the company’s bottom line. In the first half of 2022, cost of sales jumped 32.7% year over year while selling, general and administrative expenses climbed 23%.The prevalent supply chain disruptions and raw material cost inflation are also weighing on the operations of industrial companies like Zebra Technologies ZBRA and A. O. Smith Corporation AOS.Extended lead times and component shortages due to supply-chain disruptions are hurting Zebra Technologies’ top line. Supply-chain constraints are impacting sales from North America.High freight costs are added concerns for Zebra Technologies. Escalating operating expenses pose a threat to ZBRA’s bottom line. In the first half of 2022, operating expenses jumped 56.8% year over year, primarily due to increase in the cost of sales.Over time, A. O. Smith has been dealing with the adverse impacts of high cost of sales due to high raw material and transportation costs. In the first half of 2022, cost of sales increased 24.4% year over year.A. O. Smith’s selling, general and administrative expenses rose 2% year over year in the first half of 2022. Escalating costs are hurting the company’s bottom line. Apart from supply-chain constraints, labor shortages are a major concern for the company.Coming back to Stanley Black, despite headwinds, the company is poised to benefit from strength in its industrial business owing to strong backlogs and healthy demand for aerospace fasteners. Successive divestments of non-core assets should help the company focus on its core areas of business growth.

There was a report that we've now confirmed that the toolmaker is going to be eliminating about 1,000 finance-related jobs. And it's part of a previously announced effort, by the way, to cut about $200 million in expenses as it deals with higher costs and slowing demand. And I know you-- now, it's interesting the different stock reactions that we're getting for these to companies.BRIAN SOZZI: First on Robinhood, I wasn't even sure-- they had five offices left at this point. I mean, they've just cut a lot of workers. Now, on Stanley Black &amp; Decker, a source tells me they have laid off people, there have been layoffs in the finance department, maybe a little bit less than what ""The Journal"" cited in their story.But this is part of a broader cost-cutting effort by Stanley Black &amp; Decker looking to cut a billion dollars in cost by next year, about 2 billion over the next few years. Now, I used to cover Stanley Black &amp; Decker as an analyst for close to 8 years. I learned that they are always continuously focused on cutting expenses from their business. This is just built into the DNA of this company.Now, their new CEO is Don Allen, longtime finance CFO. So I can't say I'm surprised. He has that knowledge of the company just continuously cutting expenses and trying to improve margins. I'm not surprised one of his early moves here as CEO now is to just tighten up that business model.BRAD SMITH: Yeah. This and especially some of the job cuts that we've been watching or even the hiring freezes over the past few weeks, some of them coming as no surprise.]"

Intel down around 47% year to date. AMD and Nvidia both off just over 50%. Yahoo Finance's Dan Howley joins us now. Dan, you're the tech expert. Semis actually getting off to a strong start for the month of October and the fourth quarter. We're seeing a rally here across the board today. But what should we expect?DAN HOWLEY: Yeah, Seana, I think what we're looking for as far as the coming quarter, obviously, on the consumer side of things, you know, how those kinds of devices will sell into the holiday season, that's pretty much the time when Intel, AMD, Nvidia, Qualcomm, those kind of companies, Micron, they do especially well because of the sales of devices, orders obviously going through and things of that nature.We've seen these companies, though, battered in the previous quarters because we've seen a slowdown in things like PC sales. And we've heard obviously Apple pulling back on what was reported to be an extension of what they were doing as far as iPhone production. So hitting some chip stocks there as well. As you mentioned, we look at something like an Nvidia down 57% year to date, AMD down 43%, Intel, 47%, Micron, 44%, Qualcomm, 35%. By the way, the S&amp;P is only down 22% year to date.So, not looking very hot for these types of companies. And part of it has to do with the fact that they had this huge, explosive growth during the pandemic as a result of people buying up different pieces of electronics. Nvidia particularly hurt because they had that kind of hangover from COVID, as well as that cryptocurrency hangover, people buying devices for mining equipment and then no longer doing that. So we've seen them have to revise-- in the prior quarter, revise their projections. And so going forward, this is going to continue to be a problem for chip companies.SEANA SMITH: All right, so might be a little bit of a while here until we see more of a sustained rally from-- on the heels of what we saw today. All right, Dan Howley, thanks so much.]"

Nvidia's CUDA platform has been the most popular so far for artificial intelligence work.However, once developers tailor their code for Nvidia chips, it is difficult to run it on graphics processing units, or GPUs, from Nvidia competitors like AMD. Meta said the software is designed to easily swap between chips without being locked in.""The unified GPU back-end support gives deep learning developers more hardware vendor choices with minimal migration costs,"" Meta said in its blog post.Nvidia and AMD did not immediately return requests for comment.Meta's software is made for AI work called inference, which is when machine learning algorithms that previously have been trained on huge amounts of data are called on to make quick judgments, such as deciding whether a photograph is of a cat or a dog.""This is a software effort that is multi-platform.

The machine learning industry is expected to grow at a compound annual growth rate of 38.8% from 2022 through 2029 and reach a value of $210 billion by the end of 2029. One of the major drivers of this growth is the increasing adoption of machine learning in a variety of industries including technology, healthcare, manufacturing, automotive, retail, advertising, automation, defense, and financial services among others.While the machine learning industry is a high-growth industry and growth stocks have been getting hammered in 2022 due to high interest rates that are straining their earnings, long-term investors can in fact benefit from the recent weakness.

We invested in the stock in the third quarter of 2019 during a cyclical downturn in the memory industry. Our rationale was that, while the memory industry is cyclical, we believed there are strong secular drivers in place that will lead to higher peaks and long-term growth. Our secular thesis is based on our conviction that the quest for ever-increasing compute speeds will increasingly rely on memory to solve bottlenecks and that increased memory content in nearly everything from mobile phones to automobiles will drive demand. Micron’s stock traded lower during the quarter due to macroeconomic concerns that led to lower earnings expectations. We increased our stake in the company, as we believe our secular thesis remains intact. We wanted to take advantage of what we view as temporary cyclical concerns that caused the stock to trade at less than 10x reasonable trough earnings per share (EPS) estimates and less than 7x recent peak EPS.”7.

The sessions, moderated by Joan Woodward, President of the Travelers Institute and Executive Vice President of Public Policy at Travelers, leverage the company’s risk management expertise and provide a platform for government officials to assist the general public in fostering resilience against cyberattacks.""Our 2022 Travelers Risk Index shows that cyber continues to be a top concern for businesses, which is why it’s so important for companies to understand the risks and prepare for a cyber event,"" said Woodward.

APD is benefiting from investments in high-return projects, new business deals, acquisitions and productivity initiatives. However, the company faces headwinds from energy cost inflation.Air Products, which is a prominent player in the chemicals space along with Dow Inc. DOW, Celanese Corporation CE and Eastman Chemical Company EMN, is well-placed to gain from its investments in industrial gas projects and project wins. It remains committed to its gasification strategy and is executing its growth projects.These projects are expected to be accretive to earnings and cash flows. The company has a total available capacity to deploy (over fiscal 2018-2027) around $35 billion in high-return investments aimed at creating significant shareholder value. It has already spent or committed roughly 73% of the capacity.The company, in October 2021, completed the asset acquisition and project financing transactions of the $12-billion Jazan project in in Saudi Arabia. It expects to close the Phase Two of this project in 2023.Last year, it also announced the $4.5 billion world-class clean energy complex in Louisiana. The project, the company’s largest-ever investment, is expected to produce more than 750 million standard cubic feet per day of blue hydrogen for local and global markets by 2026.Air Products, in April 2020, also completed the buyout of five steam methane reformer hydrogen production plants for $530 million from PBF Energy. The PBF deal is expected to be accretive to the company’s bottom line. Air Products, in Apr 2022, also purchased Air Liquide's industrial gases business in the United Arab Emirates (""UAE""), including liquid bulk, packaged gases and specialty gases.APD also acquired Air Liquide's majority share in MECD, which owns and operates a liquid CO2 manufacturing site in Bahrain. By purchasing these businesses, Air Products broadened its footprint and regional presence in the UAE and Bahrain.The company is also boosting productivity to improve its cost structure. It is seeing the positive impacts of its productivity actions. Benefits from additional productivity and cost improvement programs are likely to support its margins moving ahead. Air Products also has been benefiting from higher pricing. Higher merchant demand is also driving its volumes.Air Products also remains committed to maximize returns to shareholders leveraging strong balance sheet and cash flows. The company, earlier this year, increased its quarterly dividend by 8% to $1.62 per share from $1.50 per share. This marked the 40th straight year of dividend increase. The company expects to pay more than $1.4 billion of dividend to shareholders in 2022.However, Air Products is exposed to challenges from cost inflation. It is witnessing higher power costs in its merchant business. The company is seeing significantly higher energy costs, especially in EMEA due to the considerably high natural gas and electricity costs. It is expected to continue to face headwinds from the power cost inflation moving ahead. As such, higher power costs are likely to weigh on margins over the near term.The company also faces headwinds from unfavorable currency translation. It witnessed significant currency headwinds in the last reported quarter, especially in Europe. Currency translation, stemming from a stronger U.S. dollar, reduced its sales and EBITDA by 5% in the quarter. In Europe, all major currencies were weaker vis-à-vis the U.S. dollar by double-digits in the quarter. The company sees continued currency headwinds moving ahead.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research? Today, you can download 7 Best Stocks for the Next 30 Days.

Today's Research Daily features new research reports on 12 major stocks, including The Walt Disney Company (DIS), Kimberly-Clark Corporation (KMB) and Barrick Gold Corporation (GOLD). These research reports have been hand-picked from the roughly 70 reports published by our analyst team today.You can see all of today’s research reports here &gt;&gt;&gt;Walt Disney shares have underperformed the broader market this year (-39.1% vs. -24.8%) on the back of sentiment shift about the streaming business that had earlier helped the stock move higher. Other issues in the Disney story have been the adverse impact of coronavirus on theme park business, higher programming and production costs at Linear Networks, heavy investments on Disney+, and a leveraged balance sheet.However, the company is benefitting from the growing popularity of Disney+, owing to a strong content portfolio and a cheaper bundle offering. Availability in the Nordics, Latin America and other Asian territories is helping it expand its user base. Theme Park business is likely to gain from strong demand across both the domestic and international parks.(You can read the full research report on Walt Disney here &gt;&gt;&gt;)Kimberly-Clark’s shares have declined -10.0% over the past six-month period against the Zacks Consumer Products – Staples industry’s decline of -28.0%. The Zacks analyst believes that Kimberly-Clark has been battling high input costs for a while now. The same persisted in the second quarter of 2022, with operating profit declining due to a rise in input costs to the tune of $405 million. Management expects adjusted operating profit to be down mid-single digit percent during 2022. Key input costs are estimated to escalate $1.4-$1.6 billion in 2022.Nonetheless, the company has been benefiting from its three growth pillars. These include focus on improving its core business in the developed markets, speeding up growth in the Personal Care segment in developing and emerging markets and enhancing digital and e-commerce capacities. Apart from this, the company’s pricing and saving initiatives have been aiding amid a rising cost environment.Story continues(You can read the full research report on Kimberly-Clark here &gt;&gt;&gt;)Barrick Gold shares have underperformed the Zacks Mining – Gold industry over the past year (-15.0% vs. -8.6%). The Zacks analyst believes that the company’s higher costs might dent its margins in 2022. Uncertainties surrounding the pandemic may impact demand for gold over the short term. Gold prices are also expected to remain volatile over the near term and are likely to be affected by interest rate hikes in 2022. Weaker copper prices are another concern.However, the company is expected to gain from progress in key growth projects that are likely to contribute to production. Barrick’s debt-reduction actions are also expected to lower interest expenses. It has a strong liquidity position and is focused on boosting shareholders’ returns by leveraging solid cash flows.

A dispute over carriage rights led the provider to suddenly cut off all Disney channels, including ESPN. Yahoo Finance's Josh Shafer joins us.ESPN getting cut off on college football Saturday?JOSH SCHAFER: ESPN on collage football Saturday Geico. And Disney too on a big weekend. It's the first weekend of October. A lot of people turn to Disney Channel on that weekend and maybe watch your first Halloween movie. The new Hocus Pocus. The Hocus Pocus. [INAUDIBLE]- You're right. You're right, yes.JOSH SCHAFER: You can see the all encompassing thing. I know. I'm a sports fan, and we talk a lot about college football. But Disney as well. And so what happened here was a contract wasn't signed. They didn't sign an extension. So on October 1, right at midnight, without telling anyone, Dish Network and Sling TV did not have access to Disney anymore.And so it got cut off. And then I actually want to read to you right now what Disney said because this did get resolved last night. So this is what Disney told us about what's going on. They said, quote, ""we have reached a handshake agreement with Dish/Sling TV, which properly reflects fair market value in terms for the Walt Disney company's unparalleled content. As a result, we are pleased to restore a portfolio of networks on a temporary basis while both parties work to finalize a new deal.So I think that temporary basis is important to highlight here. It does not seem like this is fully settled yet. And now, there were reports that Dish said that they were going to have to pay an additional billion dollars to continue this deal, and that was kind of the sticking point. I would argue for Dish Network, a stock that has not done well and really a company that only has 10 million subscribers, you kind of need ESPN. So they need to figure that out right. That's what people are coming for.Story continues- Well, I was going to say, this shows you-- I mean, I just saw social blow up in the morning on Saturday because of this. This shows you why people are still keeping the cord, if that's even the way to describe the Dish, right?JOSH SCHAFER: Yeah, well because--- Sports is in.JOSH SCHAFER: I think you have Sling TV too, right, which has about 2 million subscribers. So I think there are people here that aren't necessarily traditional cable subscribers, but they're using Dish for that. And it's something to keep in mind when you think about companies like a Dish, fuboTV, Roku.Even if you're a YouTube TV subscriber owned by Google. YouTube had this problem last December with Disney specifically.

Former President leftist Luis Inácio Lula Da Silva-- also known as Lula-- received 48.4% of the vote yesterday. Bolsonaro got 43.2%. So the two will now face off on October 31 in what is widely regarded as the most important vote in decades for Brazil. That's because of the starkly different visions the two men have for the country-- Lula on the left, Bolsonaro on the right.Nord Stream 1 and 2 pipelines-- they finally stopped leaking, the Danish Energy Agency said. That's after ruptures were discovered in the natural gas lines last week. The two major lines, which were built to deliver natural gas from Russia to Germany, ruptured in three separate places last week after explosions under the Baltic Sea. Official causes have not been identified, but some political leaders have suggested the incident was an act of sabotage. There's a lot of accusations that are being thrown around.And Disney-owned TV channels are back on Dish Network's platforms after the two companies reached a tentative deal for a new contract. This comes after millions of Dish customers experienced a weekend blackout, losing access to Disney networks like ESPN and ABC. When news of the dispute first broke on Friday, Dish was accusing Disney of holding viewers hostage, and that they were demanding nearly a billion-dollar increase. There's usually incendiary language like that when these kinds of disputes happen, but this one seems to be over [INAUDIBLE]]"

(NYSE:JNPR) from its intrinsic value? Using the most recent financial data, we'll take a look at whether the stock is fairly priced by taking the expected future cash flows and discounting them to today's value. This will be done using the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model. It may sound complicated, but actually it is quite simple!Remember though, that there are many ways to estimate a company's value, and a DCF is just one method. Anyone interested in learning a bit more about intrinsic value should have a read of the Simply Wall St analysis model. See our latest analysis for Juniper Networks The ModelWe are going to use a two-stage DCF model, which, as the name states, takes into account two stages of growth. The first stage is generally a higher growth period which levels off heading towards the terminal value, captured in the second 'steady growth' period. In the first stage we need to estimate the cash flows to the business over the next ten years. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.Generally we assume that a dollar today is more valuable than a dollar in the future, so we need to discount the sum of these future cash flows to arrive at a present value estimate:10-year free cash flow (FCF) forecast2023202420252026202720282029203020312032 Levered FCF ($, Millions) US$725.8mUS$763.7mUS$793.2mUS$819.2mUS$842.7mUS$864.6mUS$885.4mUS$905.4mUS$925.0mUS$944.4mGrowth Rate Estimate SourceAnalyst x4Analyst x3Est @ 3.85%Est @ 3.28%Est @ 2.88%Est @ 2.6%Est @ 2.4%Est @ 2.26%Est @ 2.17%Est @ 2.1% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 6.5% US$681US$673US$656US$636US$614US$591US$568US$545US$523US$501(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$6.0bStory continuesAfter calculating the present value of future cash flows in the initial 10-year period, we need to calculate the Terminal Value, which accounts for all future cash flows beyond the first stage. For a number of reasons a very conservative growth rate is used that cannot exceed that of a country's GDP growth. In this case we have used the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield (1.9%) to estimate future growth. In the same way as with the 10-year 'growth' period, we discount future cash flows to today's value, using a cost of equity of 6.5%.Terminal Value (TV)= FCF2032 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$944m× (1 + 1.9%) ÷ (6.5%– 1.9%) = US$21bPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$21b÷ ( 1 + 6.5%)10= US$11bThe total value, or equity value, is then the sum of the present value of the future cash flows, which in this case is US$17b. The last step is to then divide the equity value by the number of shares outstanding. Relative to the current share price of US$26.6, the company appears quite good value at a 50% discount to where the stock price trades currently. The assumptions in any calculation have a big impact on the valuation, so it is better to view this as a rough estimate, not precise down to the last cent.dcfThe AssumptionsThe calculation above is very dependent on two assumptions. The first is the discount rate and the other is the cash flows. Part of investing is coming up with your own evaluation of a company's future performance, so try the calculation yourself and check your own assumptions. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Juniper Networks as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 6.5%, which is based on a levered beta of 1.087. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.Next Steps:Valuation is only one side of the coin in terms of building your investment thesis, and it ideally won't be the sole piece of analysis you scrutinize for a company. It's not possible to obtain a foolproof valuation with a DCF model. Instead the best use for a DCF model is to test certain assumptions and theories to see if they would lead to the company being undervalued or overvalued. For example, changes in the company's cost of equity or the risk free rate can significantly impact the valuation. Why is the intrinsic value higher than the current share price?

Therefore, you might want to consider some of the key factors that could influence the stock's performance in the near future.Over the past month, shares of this oil and gas exploration company have returned -14.5%, compared to the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's -9.2% change. During this period, the Zacks Oil and Gas - Exploration and Production - United States industry, which Devon Energy falls in, has lost 11.6%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?While media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.Revisions to Earnings EstimatesRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.We essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.For the current quarter, Devon Energy is expected to post earnings of $2.36 per share, indicating a change of +118.5% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -2% over the last 30 days.The consensus earnings estimate of $9.24 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of +161.8%. This estimate has changed -0.2% over the last 30 days.Story continuesFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $10.54 indicates a change of +14.1% from what Devon Energy is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed +1.7%.With an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) for Devon Energy.The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPS12-month consensus EPS estimate for DVN _12MonthEPSChartUrlRevenue Growth ForecastWhile earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.For Devon Energy, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $4.9 billion indicates a year-over-year change of +41.4%. For the current and next fiscal years, $19.85 billion and $20.15 billion estimates indicate +66.5% and +1.5% changes, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryDevon Energy reported revenues of $5.63 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +132.8%. EPS of $2.59 for the same period compares with $0.60 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $4.8 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +17.26%. The EPS surprise was +8.82%.The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates three times over this period.ValuationWithout considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.While comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.As part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.Devon Energy is graded B on this front, indicating that it is trading at a discount to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.ConclusionThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Devon Energy. However, its Zacks Rank #2 does suggest that it may outperform the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

This is reassuring as this suggests that insiders have increased optimism about the company's prospects.Although we don't think shareholders should simply follow insider transactions, we do think it is perfectly logical to keep tabs on what insiders are doing. View our latest analysis for Oracle Oracle Insider Transactions Over The Last YearOver the last year, we can see that the biggest insider purchase was by Independent Director Charles Moorman for US$1.3m worth of shares, at about US$84.57 per share. That means that even when the share price was higher than US$63.08 (the recent price), an insider wanted to purchase shares. It's very possible they regret the purchase, but it's more likely they are bullish about the company. We always take careful note of the price insiders pay when purchasing shares. Generally speaking, it catches our eye when insiders have purchased shares at above current prices, as it suggests they believed the shares were worth buying, even at a higher price.In the last twelve months insiders purchased 17.28k shares for US$1.5m. On the other hand they divested 6.00k shares, for US$505k. In total, Oracle insiders bought more than they sold over the last year.

Usually, the higher the insider ownership, the more likely it is that insiders will be incentivised to build the company for the long term. Oracle insiders own about US$73b worth of shares (which is 43% of the company). Most shareholders would be happy to see this sort of insider ownership, since it suggests that management incentives are well aligned with other shareholders.Story continuesSo What Do The Oracle Insider Transactions Indicate?It doesn't really mean much that no insider has traded Oracle shares in the last quarter. On a brighter note, the transactions over the last year are encouraging. Judging from their transactions, and high insider ownership, Oracle insiders feel good about the company's future. In addition to knowing about insider transactions going on, it's beneficial to identify the risks facing Oracle.

We invested in the stock in the third quarter of 2019 during a cyclical downturn in the memory industry. Our rationale was that, while the memory industry is cyclical, we believed there are strong secular drivers in place that will lead to higher peaks and long-term growth. Our secular thesis is based on our conviction that the quest for ever-increasing compute speeds will increasingly rely on memory to solve bottlenecks and that increased memory content in nearly everything from mobile phones to automobiles will drive demand. Micron’s stock traded lower during the quarter due to macroeconomic concerns that led to lower earnings expectations. We increased our stake in the company, as we believe our secular thesis remains intact.

It was at 96.9 percent when the year 2022 started.The Aon Pension Risk Tracker calculates the aggregate funded position on an accounting basis for companies in the S&amp;P/TSX Composite Index with defined benefit (DB) plans. To access Aon's interactive tracker, which dates back to 2013, click here. The tool uses Aon's Risk Analyzer platform, which allows plan sponsors to track their individual plan's funded status on a daily basis. Key findings in Q3 2022 include:Pension assets lost 0.1 percent over the third quarter of 2022.The long-term Government of Canada bond yield decreased 5 basis points (bps) relative to the last quarter-end rate, and credit spreads narrowed by 16 bps. This combination resulted in a decrease in the interest rates used to value pension liabilities from 4.83% to 4.62%. Since most pension plans are still exposed to interest rate risk, pension liabilities increased more than assets due to the the reduction in the discount rate.""The small reduction in discount rates, coupled with poor return-seeking asset performance over the quarter, reversed some of the increase in funded positions over the previous two quarters,"" said Nathan LaPierre, partner, Wealth Solutions, Aon. ""Funded positions are slightly better than at the beginning of the year. Plan sponsors should carefully consider de-risking activities as they seek to make better decisions that help maintain those funded positions through the significant volatility we're currently experiencing.""For more information, please visit here.About Aon Aon plc (NYSE: AON) exists to shape decisions for the better — to protect and enrich the lives of people around the world.

271,4a2b198f-b425-3c24-86d4-cc5464e0aa04,MCD,2022-10-04,Here is What to Know Beyond Why McDonald's Corporation (MCD) is a Trending Stock,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/know-beyond-why-mcdonalds-corporation-130001650.html,1664802001,STORY,['MCD'],"[McDonald's (MCD) has recently been on Zacks.com's list of the most searched stocks. Therefore, you might want to consider some of the key factors that could influence the stock's performance in the near future.Shares of this world's biggest hamburger chain have returned -9.3% over the past month versus the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's -9.2% change. The Zacks Retail - Restaurants industry, to which McDonald's belongs, has lost 5.2% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?Although media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.Revisions to Earnings EstimatesRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.Our analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.For the current quarter, McDonald's is expected to post earnings of $2.47 per share, indicating a change of -10.5% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed +0% over the last 30 days.The consensus earnings estimate of $9.83 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of +5.9%. This estimate has remained unchanged over the last 30 days.Story continuesFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $10.52 indicates a change of +7% from what McDonald's is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has remained unchanged.Having a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, McDonald's is rated Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPS12-month consensus EPS estimate for MCD _12MonthEPSChartUrlProjected Revenue GrowthEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.For McDonald's, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $5.77 billion indicates a year-over-year change of -7%. For the current and next fiscal years, $22.76 billion and $23.58 billion estimates indicate -2% and +3.6% changes, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryMcDonald's reported revenues of $5.72 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -2.9%. EPS of $2.55 for the same period compares with $2.37 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $5.86 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of -2.42%. The EPS surprise was +4.08%.Over the last four quarters, McDonald's surpassed consensus EPS estimates three times. The company topped consensus revenue estimates two times over this period.ValuationNo investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.Comparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.As part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.McDonald's is graded D on this front, indicating that it is trading at a premium to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.ConclusionThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about McDonald's. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

277,ed03ef35-4266-3078-bc79-1775793962b1,AXP,2022-10-04,Business travelers are demanding more bleisure,Fortune,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/business-travelers-demanding-more-bleisure-120549226.html,1664798749,STORY,['AXP'],"[COVID-19—and all of the disruptions to life that came with it—has brought into question the many ways we work, and business travel is no exception.With companies bolstering their business travel spending as the world emerges from the pandemic, almost four-fifths of U.K. business travelers are demanding their company prioritize their well-being, new research from American Express has found.Workers are demanding more combined business and leisure trips—also known as bleisure—as well as more access to business class and the airline lounges, and the ability to bring family members or partners along with them at no extra cost.In a survey of 500 business travelers and 500 senior business travel decision makers in the U.K. conducted for American Express by Opinium from July 25–29, the card payment services company found that more than two-thirds of U.K. businesses are planning to boost travel spending by 50% or more. Businesses want more travel as they believe it will drive more revenue and growth, and help them expand to new markets.Around 77% of businesses said they had suffered due to their inability to travel over the past two years, as they see travel as a valuable tool in connecting remote teams and getting teams together, the survey found. Workers concur: 70% of business travelers said that face-to-face meetings are essential in achieving their business objectives.But as business travelers pack their bags and check in to flights, they have much higher expectations from their employers. Around 71% of business travelers said they would leave their role if their employer didn’t prioritize their well-being during their trips.“Our research shows that business travel and the value of in-person connections in driving growth go hand in hand,"" said Hana Lear, vice president of U.K. card services at American Express. “However, there’s clearly a renewed focus on the entire business travel experience to ensure both companies and employees maximize the value of trips.”Story continuesThe rise of BleisureBleisure is a concept that first described in 2009 by the business consulting group Future Laboratory, and it has become increasingly relevant during the pandemic-inspired shift in the way we work. Companies that permit bleisure allow employees to extend their business trips to spend time vacationing and sightseeing at their destination—with some even allowing families or partners to come along.The movement has grown exponentially over the last decade and has become a common demand among employees who are asked to travel. The American Express survey found that almost 42% of business travelers preferred business trips where they blend business with leisure time, and 43% of businesses are finding new ways to help their employees enjoy bleisure. One in three employers said that they were allowing workers to bring a partner or family member along at little to no extra cost.Bleisure in seen as making business trips less stressful for employees, increasing job satisfaction and productivity, and helping employee retention.Travel industry interestThere are also many positives to bleisure for the ailing airline and hospitality industries. While leisure travel has largely rebounded to pre-pandemic levels, airlines—which saw a loss of some 75% of their income with the rise of remote working and online conferences—don't expect to see a full recovery until 2024 because of the drop in business travel. Bleisure could speed this recovery.Bleisure is also more sustainable, which is one of the top concerns for business travelers. More than 70% of business travelers said they worried about the environmental impact and the carbon footprint of their trips, according to the American Express survey, which can be mitigated if they combine a necessary work trip with a family vacation that would otherwise require another flight.But bleisure does come with a catch. In an already deeply connected and always online world, bleisure further erodes the barriers between personal and professional lives.

All right, let's get on over to Jared Blikre in studio here at the YFi Interactive to see how things are kicking off. Jared.JARED BLIKRE: That's right. We got the Dow leading by a hefty margin here, especially compared to the NASDAQ. Dow up almost 1%, 9/10 of a percent. NASDAQ up 15 basis points. When we see these discrepancies, a lot of times, it's explained by the bond market, not necessarily today. We'll get to that in a second. Here is the VIX. We can see it coming down from earlier highs. This is a two-month chart, so you can see we are still at the upper end of the recent range, meaning volatility is heightened here.Also, want to show you what's happening to bond volatility. And let's see if I can find the MOVE index. Now this is as of the close Friday, but you can see it came down. And this is despite seeing a lot of that bond volatility melt into all other risk assets last week. And here is the 10-year T-note yield. It is down 12 basis points.Now, what I said earlier, usually, this would favor the tech sector over value stocks, such as energy and financials. But I think the jolt that we're getting to energy right now from that crude oil news-- and I'll give that in a second as well-- the energy sector is up 4% today, followed by materials. You'd think the dollar is crashing. It is not.So OPEC+ may be going to cut by as much as a million barrels. That's a decision that's coming forthcoming this week. We'll have to see if anything comes of it, but they have made waves that this may be coming at prior meetings. So would not be a complete surprise. However, 1 million barrels per day is a very large number.I want to get to the NASDAQ 100 here, and you can see Tesla is a big standout-- we've been talking about that-- the miss on deliveries. Apple and Tesla both kind of looking a little bit sick right here. And these are two very important stocks, arguably two of the most bellwether stocks, if I can use that as an adjective, that we have in the US stock universe.Story continuesNow, here is Tesla on a year-to-date basis. You can see we're kind of racing down towards these June, July lows. This was an important base, so we're testing the upper-- actually, we are right in the middle of it right now. So we're probably going to test the lower end. Have to see if that comes in-- what is that? About 210, 220, something in there.In the meantime, want to take a look at Apple as well. That's up 43 basis points, but it is also heading down to these lows. So these are some make or break points that we are going to watch with these two big leaders in the days and weeks to come, guys.BRIAN SOZZI: Jared Blikre, thanks so much.]"
286,528b4289-0a26-358d-ae50-4e3763a3e56e,OXY,2022-10-04,4 Blue-Chip Stocks to Sell in October,InvestorPlace,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/4-blue-chip-stocks-sell-211755531.html,1664572675,STORY,"['TGT', 'OXY', 'FCX', 'COST', 'PEP']","[In general, when markets trend lower, it makes sense to invest in blue-chip stocks. They tend to have a low beta and also provide regular cash flows through dividends. Yet, not all blue chips are created equal. Based on macroeconomic or company-specific factors, there are some you want to buy and some blue-chip stocks to sell.For example, blue-chip retailer Target (NYSE:TGT) sits 45% below its 52-week high, weighed down by inflationary pressures and margin compression. And pharmaceutical giant Pfizer (NYSE:PFE) is 30% below its high on concerns of a slowdown in growth predominately due to lower Covid-19 vaccine sales.So, investors need to carry out due diligence even with blue chips. Today’s list of blue-chip stocks to sell in October contains popular names that are likely to correct or correct even further.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsPEPPepsiCo$163.26COSTCostco Wholesale$472.27FCXFreeport-McMoRan$27.35OXYOccidental Petroleum$61.43PepsiCo (PEP)PepsiCo building in Russia. PEP stock.Source: 8ED8 / ShutterstockPepsiCo (NASDAQ:PEP) stock is up 11% over the past year, bucking the broader bear market, and it throws off a healthy 2.7% dividend yield. However, shares look expensive with a forward price-earnings ratio of 22.8.PepsiCo is likely to see decelerating growth or margin pressure in the coming quarters. The company is reportedly considering cost-cutting measures, including layoffs and buyouts for some employees over 55. Shares have fallen around 3% since the story broke. A confirmation from the company could trigger panic selling.It’s also worth noting that Pepsi has finally stopped production in Russia. The country happens to be the company’s second-largest international market after Mexico. The implication of the production halt on growth remains to be seen.Amid these uncertainties, PEP stock’s valuation looks stretched and shares are likely to correct in the near term. Having said that, a 15% to 20% correction from current levels to the $130s would be a good time to consider some bullish exposure.Story continuesCostco Wholesale (COST)A Costco Wholesale (COST) warehouse in Auburn Hills, Michigan.Source: ilzesgimene / Shutterstock.comIn the long term, Costco Wholesale (NASDAQ:COST) is possibly the best bet among retail stocks. The company has built a strong omnichannel sales presence. Rising member fees are likely to support cash flow, and comparable-store sales have been rising. However, I remain cautious in the near term.COST stock has been resilient in the face of the bear market, up 6% over the past year. Yet, with a forward price-earnings ratio of 33.9, shares look relatively expensive amid mounting economic uncertainties including the possibility of a recession in the U.S. in 2023. The impact of aggressive interest rate hikes on consumer spending remains to be seen. I also expect Costco to face margin pressure in a slowdown or recession scenario.Those who wish to go long COST stock are likely to get a much better entry point after shares correct.Freeport-McMoRan (FCX)Freeport-McMoRan Stock's Long List of Catalysts Boosts Its Buy StatusSource: 360b / Shutterstock.comDoctor copper has continued to weaken due to two factors. First and foremost, the U.S. dollar has been gaining strength. Second, global economic uncertainty is likely to translate into lower copper demand. In this scenario, I would avoid miner Freeport-McMoRan (NYSE:FCX).FCX stock is 15.6% lower over the past year, slightly better than the S&amp;P 500’s 17.7% decline. However, in the event of a global recession, FCX stock is likely to correct further. While its forward price-earnings ratio of 13.1 is well below the broader market index’s forward P/E of 17.9, keep in mind that, in general, cyclical stocks tend to have a lower price-earnings ratio.In terms of business fundamentals, Freeport-McMoRan has utilized the copper bull market to strengthen its balance sheet. At the end of the second quarter, the company had just $1.6 billion in net debt. While management expects copper sales to increase in 2023, this may be offset by lower prices.In short, this doesn’t look like the ideal time to jump into a copper play. Those who wait for a further correction will likely be rewarded for their patience.Occidental Petroleum (OXY)A magnifying glass zooms in on the Occidental Petroleum website.Source: Pavel Kapysh / Shutterstock.comOccidental Petroleum (NYSE:OXY) is on my list of blue-chip stocks to sell because it has gotten much too far ahead of itself, with shares nearly doubling in the past year. Much of this investor enthusiasm has been due to the fact that Warren Buffett continues to buy up shares despite falling oil prices. Lower oil prices will translate into EBITDA margin compression on a relative basis in the coming quarters.Now, I don’t expect a big plunge in oil prices in the coming quarters even if we enter a recession. However, based on how far OXY stock has run over the past 12 months, there appears to be much more downside risk than upside potential at the current level, especially if oil prices continue to trend lower.I’m not the only one who thinks this. Analysts from Citigroup and JPMorgan both have “neutral” ratings on the stock due to what they see as capped upside over the next few months.That said, I like the fact that Occidental is focused on deleveraging. In the next few years, the company is likely to have an investment-grade balance sheet. This will provide greater headroom for dividend growth and share repurchases.Yet, while Buffett may have pockets deep enough to ride out a big correction in the stock, individual investors may not feel the same way.On the date of publication, Faisal Humayun did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

The therapy treats beta-thalassemia in adult and pediatric patients who require regular red blood cell (RBC) transfusions across all genotypes.The FDA approvals boost bluebird bio’s growth prospects, but the successful commercialization of these therapies holds the key. Moreover, gene therapies are complex by nature.  Story continuesbluebird will face stiff competition in the target market. CRISPR Therapeutics CRSP and its partner Vertex Pharmaceuticals VRTX announced that the FDA granted a rolling review to the gene therapy exagamglogene autotemcel (exa-cel), formerly known as CTX001. The companies are developing the therapy for treating sickle cell disease (SCD) and transfusion-dependent beta thalassemia (TDT).Vertex intends to submit its BLA for exa-cell for a rolling review by the FDA by the start of November and expects to complete the process by the end of first-quarter 2023.These approvals have provided bluebird two priority review vouchers, which are transferable. These vouchers can help shorten the review process of a new drug application (NDA) from 10 months to six months. With the intent of exploring additional financing opportunities, bluebird intends to monetize these vouchers in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

296,1c20264b-0919-341a-ae5d-dd801c4d0d8d,TXT,2022-10-04,Boeing (BA) Wins $192M Deal to Support F/A-18E/F & E/A-18G Jets,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/boeing-ba-wins-192m-deal-131001595.html,1664802601,STORY,"['BA', 'NOC', 'LMT', 'TXT']","[The Boeing Company BA recently secured a contract involving the F/A-18E/F and E/A-18G combat jets. The award has been offered by the Naval Supply Systems Command Weapon Systems Support, Philadelphia, PA.Details of the DealValued at $191.8 million, the contract is expected to be completed by July 2025. Per the terms of the deal, Boeing will be engaged in the repair of multiple flight control surfaces used on the F/A-18E/F and E/A-18G aircraft.The majority of the work related to this deal will be carried out in Jacksonville, FL.What’s Favoring Boeing?Boeing, one of the major players in the defense business, stands out among its peers by virtue of its broadly diversified programs, strong order bookings and solid backlog. Furthermore, the company's expertise lies in a wide variety of aircraft components, repairs and modification-related programs.Notably, its Defense, Space &amp; Security segment’s portfolio has fixed-wing military aircraft, including F/A-18E/F Super Hornet, F-15 programs, P-8 programs, KC-46A Tanker and T-7A Red Hawk.  Boeing's combat-proven aerospace programs and associated services, along with the rapidly growing need for military aircraft due to heightened geopolitical uncertainties worldwide, result in a solid inflow of orders from the Pentagon. The latest contract win is an example of that. Such order flows, in turn, should boost the top line of the defense business segment.Growth ProspectsWith rising security threats across the globe, emerging economies like the Asia Pacific, the Middle East and South America are spending a lot on enhancing their defense arsenals. Meanwhile, developed nations like the United States and Europe have already been leading the defense market. With the United States being the largest worldwide weapons exporter, the nation has been spending amply on defense products. Boeing, the largest aircraft manufacturer in the United States, thus enjoys a dominant position in the combat aircraft market.Per a Mordor Intelligence report, the global combat aircraft market is expected to witness a CAGR of 2.5% during the 2021-2026 time period, with North America constituting the largest share of this market. Such growth can be attributed to a rise in global threats and geopolitical instabilities and increased spending on defense. These projections should benefit Boeing along with other U.S.-based combat jet manufacturers like Northrop Grumman NOC, Lockheed Martin LMT and Textron TXT.Story continuesSince its inception, Northrop Grumman has been a pioneer in the development of manned aircraft for combat. Northrop Grumman also has a tradition of providing technological leadership in all aspects of military aviation and aircraft, such as manned, unmanned, targeting, surveillance, and aircraft self-protection systems that enable warfighters to accomplish missions anytime and anywhere, under any conditions.Its Aeronautics Systems unit is engaged in the design, development, production, integration, sustainment and modernization of advanced aircraft systems, whereas its Mission Systems segment offers advanced mission solutions and multifunction systems like Airborne Early Warning &amp; Control (AEW&amp;C), LONGBOW Fire Control Radar (FCR) and Scalable Agile Beam Radar (SABR).Lockheed’s Aeronautics business segment is engaged in the research, design, development, manufacture, integration, sustainment, support and upgrade of advanced military aircraft, including combat and air mobility aircraft, unmanned air vehicles and related technologies. Its major programs include F-35, C-130 Hercules, F-16 Fighting Falcon and F-22 Raptor jets.Moreover, its Missiles and Fire Control segment offers varied air defense solutions like its Joint Air-to-Surface Standoff Missile (JASSM) tactical missile program, an air-to-ground missile launched from fixed-wing aircraft. Hellfire is another air-to-ground missile, which is manufactured by Lockheed and used on rotary and fixed-wing aircraft.Textron’s business unit, Textron Aviation Defense, designs, builds and supports versatile and globally-known military aircraft, preferred for training and attack missions. Textron Aviation’s military trainer and defense aircraft include the T-6 trainer, which has been used to train pilots from more than 20 countries, and the AT-6 light attack military aircraft.Moreover, its subsidiary, Able Aerospace Services provides component and maintenance, repair and overhaul services in support of commercial and military fixed- and rotor-wing aircraft.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

297,047c71f9-0455-37bc-a864-cbadfa719f7d,NSC,2022-10-04,Norfolk Southern (NSC) Strong on Dividends Despite Cost Woes,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/norfolk-southern-nsc-strong-dividends-150003013.html,1664809203,STORY,"['NSC', 'CSX', 'UNP']","[Norfolk Southern’s NSC efforts to reward its shareholders through dividends and buybacks are encouraging. However, high fuel costs are concerning as the same is limiting bottom-line growth.Factors Favoring NSCWe are impressed with Norfolk Southern's efforts to reward its shareholders through dividends and buybacks. In January 2022, NSC’s board announced a 14% increase in its quarterly dividend payout, taking the total to $1.24 per share. This was the third dividend hike approval in a year’s time.A strong free cash flow generating ability supports NSC's shareholder-friendly activities. In 2021, Norfolk Southern generated a free cash flow of $2,785 million, up 30% year over year. In first-half 2022, free cash flow was $1,174 million.Driven by strong freight demand, revenues are likely to have been impressive in third-quarter 2022. Owing to upbeat revenues, operating ratio (operating expenses as a percentage of revenues) is likely to have improved year over year in the September quarter.Key RisksFuel expenses represent a key input cost for any transportation player, and Norfolk Southern is no exception. The current scenario of increasing fuel costs does not bode well as far as bottom-line growth is concerned. At NSC, fuel costs surged 94% year over year in first-half 2022, inducing a 17% rise in operating costs.Norfolk Southern is also being hurt by headwinds like supply-chain disruptions and slower network velocity. Due to these headwinds, overall volumes declined 3% year over year in the June quarter. Volumes contracted in first-quarter 2022 as well.High Fuel Costs a Bane for Other Railroads TooThanks to the northward movement in oil price (up 48% in first-half 2022) induced by the Russia-Ukraine war, fuel expenses are on the rise, hurting bottom-line growth of not only Norfolk Southern but other railroads like Union Pacific Corporation UNP and CSX Corporation CSX as well.At Union Pacific, fuel expenses escalated 82% in first-half 2022, causing a 20% jump in operating costs. The increase in operating costs affected the key efficiency metric of operating ratio (operating expenses as a % of revenues) to the tune of 130 basis points in the June quarter.Story continuesFuel costs are likely to be high in the September quarter as well. Results will be out on Oct 20. High capital expenditures may also be a downside as far as Union Pacific’s bottom line is concerned in the third quarter.At CSX, operating expenses increased 41% year over year in first-half 2022, mainly due to the 102% rise in fuel expenses. The increase in fuel costs was due to the steep rise in highway diesel fuel prices and the addition of non-locomotive fuel used for trucking. Costs are likely to be high in the September quarter too. Detailed results will be out on Oct 20.Like UNP, capital expenditures are high at CSX. In 2021, CSX’s capital expenditures were $1.79 billion, higher than $1.63 billion in 2020.  For 2022, CSX expects capital expenditures to increase to approximately $2 billion. High capex may also hurt CSX’s free cash flow-generating ability.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research? Today, you can download 7 Best Stocks for the Next 30 Days.

Let’s take a closer look.Share Performance Over the last year, the shares of both companies have been notably strong, easily outperforming the general market.Still, PEP’s nearly 12% gain edges out KO’s 9% increase.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchOver the last three months, the story remains the same – PEP shares have been notably more defensive than Coca-Cola shares, down 3% vs. KO’s 12% decline.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchThe difference in price action between the shares of both companies tells us buyers have defended PEP shares much more, undoubtedly a significant factor.ValuationPivoting to valuation, both companies sport a Value Style Score of a C.KO shares currently trade at a 22.7X forward earnings multiple, nicely below their five-year median of 24.6X.On the contrary, PEP shares trade at a 24.5X forward earnings multiple, just above their five-year median of 24.1X.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchWhile PEP shares have enjoyed stronger price action, KO shares are slightly cheaper, trading below their five-year median.Growth EstimatesOf course, growth is a key factor in selecting any stock.For KO’s current fiscal year, earnings and revenue are forecasted to climb 6% and 9.8%, respectively.Story continues Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchPivoting to PEP, earnings are projected to climb 6.4% in FY22 on top of forecasted revenue growth of 5.6%. Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchHowever, PEP’s FY23 estimates are stronger than KO’s, with PepsiCo’s bottom-line forecasted to expand 8.5% in FY23 vs. KO’s projected 5% uptick.Revenue estimates paint the same story for FY23; PEP’s forecasted Y/Y revenue growth of 3.6% in FY23 marginally beats KO’s 3.1% projected growth rate.While Coca-Cola is forecasted to have a stronger year of growth in FY22, PepsiCo’s FY23 estimates pick up the slack.Dividends Dividends are a massive factor in selecting any stock. After all, who doesn’t enjoy getting paid?Impressively, KO and PEP are both Dividend Kings, showing an unparalleled commitment to their shareholders through 50+ consecutive years of increased dividend payouts.KO’s 3.1% annual dividend yield is notably higher than PepsiCo’s 2.8%.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchHowever, PEP has grown its dividend at a much stronger pace; the company carries a 6.5% five-year annualized dividend growth rate vs. Coca-Cola’s 3%.While the yield may be lower for PEP shares, the dividend growth is undoubtedly the real highlight and an additional factor that differentiates the two.Bottom LineIt’s the battle of the beverage titans, and it’s looking to go to the judge’s scorecard.Both companies are absolute titans within the Zacks Consumer Staples Sector, with years and years of established operations.PepsiCo PEP has had a more robust performance in the market as of late, carries higher dividend growth metrics, and has a stronger growth profile for the next fiscal year.On the other hand, Coca-Cola KO shares appear to be cheaper, and the company has a more fruitful growth outlook for the current fiscal year. It’s worth noting that both companies’ fiscal years end in December.In addition, both carry a favorable Zacks Rank, undoubtedly significant positives.With volatility reigning supreme in the market all year long, both look to be solid picks for those who need defense blended into their portfolios.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Given that stock prices are usually aligned with a company's financial performance in the long-term, we decided to investigate if the company's decent financials had a hand to play in the recent price move. Specifically, we decided to study Stryker's  ROE in this article.ROE or return on equity is a useful tool to assess how effectively a company can generate returns on the investment it received from its shareholders. Put another way, it reveals the company's success at turning shareholder investments into profits. Check out our latest analysis for Stryker How To Calculate Return On Equity?Return on equity can be calculated by using the formula:Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' EquitySo, based on the above formula, the ROE for Stryker is:13% = US$2.1b ÷ US$16b (Based on the trailing twelve months to June 2022).The 'return' is the income the business earned over the last year. Another way to think of that is that for every $1 worth of equity, the company was able to earn $0.13 in profit.What Has ROE Got To Do With Earnings Growth?We have already established that ROE serves as an efficient profit-generating gauge for a company's future earnings. We now need to evaluate how much profit the company reinvests or ""retains"" for future growth which then gives us an idea about the growth potential of the company. Assuming all else is equal, companies that have both a higher return on equity and higher profit retention are usually the ones that have a higher growth rate when compared to companies that don't have the same features.A Side By Side comparison of Stryker's Earnings Growth And 13% ROETo start with, Stryker's ROE looks acceptable. Further, the company's ROE is similar to the industry average of 12%. Despite the modest returns, Stryker's five year net income growth was quite low, averaging at only 2.2%. So, there could be some other factors at play that could be impacting the company's growth. For instance, the company pays out a huge portion of its earnings as dividends, or is faced with competitive pressures.Story continuesNext, on comparing with the industry net income growth, we found that Stryker's reported growth was lower than the industry growth of 19% in the same period, which is not something we like to see.past-earnings-growthEarnings growth is an important metric to consider when valuing a stock. The investor should try to establish if the expected growth or decline in earnings, whichever the case may be, is priced in. By doing so, they will have an idea if the stock is headed into clear blue waters or if swampy waters await. Has the market priced in the future outlook for SYK? You can find out in our latest intrinsic value infographic research report. Is Stryker Making Efficient Use Of Its Profits?While Stryker has a decent three-year median payout ratio of 49% (or a retention ratio of 51%), it has seen very little growth in earnings. So there could be some other explanation in that regard. For instance, the company's business may be deteriorating.In addition, Stryker has been paying dividends over a period of at least ten years suggesting that keeping up dividend payments is way more important to the management even if it comes at the cost of business growth. Upon studying the latest analysts' consensus data, we found that the company's future payout ratio is expected to drop to 30% over the next three years. Accordingly, the expected drop in the payout ratio explains the expected increase in the company's ROE to 21%, over the same period.ConclusionOverall, we feel that Stryker certainly does have some positive factors to consider. Although, we are disappointed to see a lack of growth in earnings even in spite of a high ROE and and a high reinvestment rate. We believe that there might be some outside factors that could be having a negative impact on the business. Having said that, looking at the current analyst estimates, we found that the company's earnings are expected to gain momentum.

Using the most recent financial data, we'll take a look at whether the stock is fairly priced by taking the forecast future cash flows of the company and discounting them back to today's value. One way to achieve this is by employing the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model. There's really not all that much to it, even though it might appear quite complex.We would caution that there are many ways of valuing a company and, like the DCF, each technique has advantages and disadvantages in certain scenarios. For those who are keen learners of equity analysis, the Simply Wall St analysis model here may be something of interest to you. View our latest analysis for Sempra Step By Step Through The CalculationAs Sempra operates in the integrated utilities sector, we need to calculate the intrinsic value slightly differently. In this approach dividends per share (DPS) are used, as free cash flow is difficult to estimate and often not reported by analysts. This often underestimates the value of a stock, but it can still be good as a comparison to competitors. We use the Gordon Growth Model, which assumes dividend will grow into perpetuity at a rate that can be sustained. For a number of reasons a very conservative growth rate is used that cannot exceed that of a company's Gross Domestic Product (GDP). In this case we used the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield (1.9%). The expected dividend per share is then discounted to today's value at a cost of equity of 5.3%. Relative to the current share price of US$155, the company appears around fair value at the time of writing. Valuations are imprecise instruments though, rather like a telescope - move a few degrees and end up in a different galaxy. Do keep this in mind.Value Per Share = Expected Dividend Per Share / (Discount Rate - Perpetual Growth Rate)= US$5.1 / (5.3% – 1.9%)= US$149dcfThe AssumptionsNow the most important inputs to a discounted cash flow are the discount rate, and of course, the actual cash flows. Part of investing is coming up with your own evaluation of a company's future performance, so try the calculation yourself and check your own assumptions. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Sempra as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 5.3%, which is based on a levered beta of 0.800. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.Story continuesLooking Ahead:Although the valuation of a company is important, it shouldn't be the only metric you look at when researching a company. DCF models are not the be-all and end-all of investment valuation. Instead the best use for a DCF model is to test certain assumptions and theories to see if they would lead to the company being undervalued or overvalued. For instance, if the terminal value growth rate is adjusted slightly, it can dramatically alter the overall result. For Sempra, we've put together three fundamental elements you should assess:Risks: We feel that you should assess the 5 warning signs for Sempra (3 can't be ignored!) we've flagged before making an investment in the company.Future Earnings: How does SRE's growth rate compare to its peers and the wider market?

However, the market is not giving the company credit for the material improvements CEO Larry Culp has made in his tenure. The balance sheet today is stronger than it has been in a very long time, and each of the three primary business segments each have strong paths to increasing earnings, regardless of the economic environment. Healthcare has historically not been a cyclical business. While Aviation typically has some economic sensitivity, the business still has a strong COVID rebound tailwind that should continue even in an uncertain environment. Power is a less cyclical business, and GE maintains a steady business servicing approximately one-third of the world’s electricity. GE is another example of strong insider buying indicating management’s confidence in the business, while the company also began buying back discounted shares. GE is still on track to break the company into three separate businesses, and we believe this will help the market properly weigh the value of each core segment.”8.

318,884834cf-3ddc-32e0-aa46-e2ad13b1b06a,PG,2022-10-04,Institutional owners may take dramatic actions as The Procter & Gamble Company's (NYSE:PG) recent 5.3% drop adds to one-year losses,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/institutional-owners-may-dramatic-actions-120009033.html,1664884809,STORY,['PG'],"[A look at the shareholders of The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG) can tell us which group is most powerful. With 65% stake, institutions possess the maximum shares in the company. That is, the group stands to benefit the most if the stock rises (or lose the most if there is a downturn).And institutional investors saw their holdings value drop by 5.3% last week. The recent loss, which adds to a one-year loss of 5.2% for stockholders, may not sit well with this group of investors. Often called “market makers”, institutions wield significant power in influencing the price dynamics of any stock. As a result, if the decline continues, institutional investors may be pressured to sell Procter &amp; Gamble which might hurt individual investors.Let's delve deeper into each type of owner of Procter &amp; Gamble, beginning with the chart below. Check out our latest analysis for Procter &amp; Gamble ownership-breakdownWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Procter &amp; Gamble?Institutions typically measure themselves against a benchmark when reporting to their own investors, so they often become more enthusiastic about a stock once it's included in a major index. We would expect most companies to have some institutions on the register, especially if they are growing.As you can see, institutional investors have a fair amount of stake in Procter &amp; Gamble. This suggests some credibility amongst professional investors. But we can't rely on that fact alone since institutions make bad investments sometimes, just like everyone does. If multiple institutions change their view on a stock at the same time, you could see the share price drop fast. It's therefore worth looking at Procter &amp; Gamble's earnings history below. Of course, the future is what really matters.earnings-and-revenue-growthInstitutional investors own over 50% of the company, so together than can probably strongly influence board decisions. Procter &amp; Gamble is not owned by hedge funds. The Vanguard Group, Inc. is currently the largest shareholder, with 9.3% of shares outstanding. With 6.8% and 4.4% of the shares outstanding respectively, BlackRock, Inc. and State Street Global Advisors, Inc. are the second and third largest shareholders.Story continuesA deeper look at our ownership data shows that the top 25 shareholders collectively hold less than half of the register, suggesting a large group of small holders where no single shareholder has a majority.Researching institutional ownership is a good way to gauge and filter a stock's expected performance. The same can be achieved by studying analyst sentiments. Quite a few analysts cover the stock, so you could look into forecast growth quite easily.Insider Ownership Of Procter &amp; GambleThe definition of an insider can differ slightly between different countries, but members of the board of directors always count. The company management answer to the board and the latter should represent the interests of shareholders. Notably, sometimes top-level managers are on the board themselves.Most consider insider ownership a positive because it can indicate the board is well aligned with other shareholders. However, on some occasions too much power is concentrated within this group.Our information suggests that The Procter &amp; Gamble Company insiders own under 1% of the company. It is a very large company, so it would be surprising to see insiders own a large proportion of the company. Though their holding amounts to less than 1%, we can see that board members collectively own US$202m worth of shares (at current prices). In this sort of situation, it can be more interesting to  see if those insiders have been buying or selling. General Public OwnershipThe general public, who are usually individual investors, hold a 35% stake in Procter &amp; Gamble. While this size of ownership may not be enough to sway a policy decision in their favour, they can still make a collective impact on company policies.Next Steps:It's always worth thinking about the different groups who own shares in a company. But to understand Procter &amp; Gamble better, we need to consider many other factors.

However, the favorable job-and-wage growth environment, which supports consumer confidence, and stimulus savings from last year are raising hopes. Predictions also suggest that retail sales will pick up during the holiday season.Per Mastercard SpendingPulse, U.S. retail sales, excluding automotive, are anticipated to surge 7.1% from a year earlier during the traditional holiday period that runs from Nov 1-Dec 24. While in-store retail sales are projected to increase 7.9%, e-commerce is expected to rise 4.2%.Obviously, this is a positive for retail REITs like Realty Income Corporation O, Simon Property Group SPG, Kimco Realty Corporation KIM and Federal Realty Investment Trust FRT.The retail real estate industry is poised to benefit from the pent-up consumer demand as consumers look for an exclusive in-store shopping experience, following the pandemic downtime. Amid these, retailers’ focus has now shifted from the closing of stores to the revival of their growth plans, resulting in more demand for physical store spaces and paving the way for the retail REITs to experience gain in leasing activity, pricing power and flourish.Retailers are also focusing on investments in their stores because apart from serving as showrooms, physical stores offer a convenient location for pick-up or exchange of goods, helping retailers counter the increasing costs associated with last-mile delivery.Furthermore, amid limited availability and with the rapid formation of new businesses in the retail sector, lease signings, rent and occupancies in retail real estates are likely to get a boost. This will support the growth of retail REITs like Realty Income, Simon Property, Kimco Realty, Federal Realty and others.Moreover, omni-channel is the focal point for retailers. Physical stores will be a vital sales channel over the long run because though there is convenience in online shopping, it cannot replace the benefits and satisfaction of visiting a brick-and-mortar store. This is quite evident from the recent foot traffic at retail destinations.Digitally native brands are likely to keep boosting their physical presence in the days to come as part of the omni-channel strategy as the opening of stores helps them improve their connection with customers and drive expansion.In fact, for retailers, the focus now is not only on boosting their online presence but also on maintaining brick-and-mortar stores in the best locations, which in turn is raising hopes for retail REITs that focus on such locations. Also, with the waning impact of the pandemic, entertainment and dining concepts are seeing a revival, boosting retail REIT’s growth scopes.Nevertheless, inflationary pressure, a slowdown in the economy and the depletion of savings might temper consumers’ willingness to spend to some extent. With office usage affected and international tourism yet to regain lost ground, certain submarkets also remain choppy.Moreover, given the convenience of online shopping, it is likely to remain a popular choice among consumers. This is likely to affect the market share for brick-and-mortar stores and hurt demand for retail REIT’s properties.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

333,5b7a9aa2-0185-3134-ae44-a2aaafe0aae7,SHW,2022-10-04,The Sherwin-Williams Company (NYSE:SHW) is favoured by institutional owners who hold 79% of the company,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/sherwin-williams-company-nyse-shw-102519048.html,1664879119,STORY,['SHW'],"[To get a sense of who is truly in control of The Sherwin-Williams Company (NYSE:SHW), it is important to understand the ownership structure of the business. With 79% stake, institutions possess the maximum shares in the company. In other words, the group stands to gain the most (or lose the most) from their investment into the company.Because institutional owners have a huge pool of resources and liquidity, their investing decisions tend to carry a great deal of weight, especially with individual investors. Hence, having a considerable amount of institutional money invested in a company is often regarded as a desirable trait.Let's take a closer look to see what the different types of shareholders can tell us about Sherwin-Williams. See our latest analysis for Sherwin-Williams ownership-breakdownWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Sherwin-Williams?Many institutions measure their performance against an index that approximates the local market. So they usually pay more attention to companies that are included in major indices.Sherwin-Williams already has institutions on the share registry. Indeed, they own a respectable stake in the company. This implies the analysts working for those institutions have looked at the stock and they like it. But just like anyone else, they could be wrong. It is not uncommon to see a big share price drop if two large institutional investors try to sell out of a stock at the same time. So it is worth checking the past earnings trajectory of Sherwin-Williams, (below). Of course, keep in mind that there are other factors to consider, too.earnings-and-revenue-growthInvestors should note that institutions actually own more than half the company, so they can collectively wield significant power. Sherwin-Williams is not owned by hedge funds. The Vanguard Group, Inc. is currently the largest shareholder, with 8.1% of shares outstanding. The Sherwin-Williams Company 401(K) Plan is the second largest shareholder owning 8.0% of common stock, and BlackRock, Inc. holds about 6.4% of the company stock.Story continuesAfter doing some more digging, we found that the top 17 have the combined ownership of 50% in the company, suggesting that no single shareholder has significant control over the company.While it makes sense to study institutional ownership data for a company, it also makes sense to study analyst sentiments to know which way the wind is blowing. There are plenty of analysts covering the stock, so it might be worth seeing what they are forecasting, too.Insider Ownership Of Sherwin-WilliamsWhile the precise definition of an insider can be subjective, almost everyone considers board members to be insiders. Company management run the business, but the CEO will answer to the board, even if he or she is a member of it.Most consider insider ownership a positive because it can indicate the board is well aligned with other shareholders. However, on some occasions too much power is concentrated within this group.Our most recent data indicates that insiders own less than 1% of The Sherwin-Williams Company. Being so large, we would not expect insiders to own a large proportion of the stock. Collectively, they own US$164m of stock. It is always good to see at least some insider ownership, but it might be worth checking if those insiders have been selling. General Public OwnershipThe general public-- including retail investors -- own 12% stake in the company, and hence can't easily be ignored. While this group can't necessarily call the shots, it can certainly have a real influence on how the company is run.Next Steps:I find it very interesting to look at who exactly owns a company. But to truly gain insight, we need to consider other information, too.

334,45a1297b-fdf7-3d85-9777-05880411aac8,AWK,2022-10-04,American Water Works (AWK) is a Top Dividend Stock Right Now: Should You Buy?,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/american-water-works-awk-top-154503321.html,1664811903,STORY,['AWK'],"[Whether it's through stocks, bonds, ETFs, or other types of securities, all investors love seeing their portfolios score big returns. However, when you're an income investor, your primary focus is generating consistent cash flow from each of your liquid investments.Cash flow can come from bond interest, interest from other types of investments, and of course, dividends. A dividend is the distribution of a company's earnings paid out to shareholders; it's often viewed by its dividend yield, a metric that measures a dividend as a percent of the current stock price. Many academic studies show that dividends account for significant portions of long-term returns, with dividend contributions exceeding one-third of total returns in many cases.American Water Works in FocusHeadquartered in Camden, American Water Works (AWK) is a Utilities stock that has seen a price change of -31.08% so far this year. Currently paying a dividend of $0.65 per share, the company has a dividend yield of 2.01%. In comparison, the Utility - Water Supply industry's yield is 1.97%, while the S&amp;P 500's yield is 1.87%.Taking a look at the company's dividend growth, its current annualized dividend of $2.62 is up 11.1% from last year. American Water Works has increased its dividend 5 times on a year-over-year basis over the last 5 years for an average annual increase of 9.82%. Any future dividend growth will depend on both earnings growth and the company's payout ratio; a payout ratio is the proportion of a firm's annual earnings per share that it pays out as a dividend. American Water Works's current payout ratio is 0%. This means it paid out 0% of its trailing 12-month EPS as dividend.Looking at this fiscal year, AWK expects solid earnings growth. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2022 is $4.45 per share, representing a year-over-year earnings growth rate of 4.71%.Bottom LineInvestors like dividends for a variety of different reasons, from tax advantages and decreasing overall portfolio risk to considerably improving stock investing profits. But, not every company offers a quarterly payout.For instance, it's a rare occurrence when a tech start-up or big growth business offers their shareholders a dividend. It's more common to see larger companies with more established profits give out dividends. During periods of rising interest rates, income investors must be mindful that high-yielding stocks tend to struggle. That said, they can take comfort from the fact that AWK is not only an attractive dividend play, but also represents a compelling investment opportunity with a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy).Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

336,528b4289-0a26-358d-ae50-4e3763a3e56e,FCX,2022-10-04,4 Blue-Chip Stocks to Sell in October,InvestorPlace,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/4-blue-chip-stocks-sell-211755531.html,1664572675,STORY,"['TGT', 'OXY', 'FCX', 'COST', 'PEP']","[In general, when markets trend lower, it makes sense to invest in blue-chip stocks. They tend to have a low beta and also provide regular cash flows through dividends. Yet, not all blue chips are created equal. Based on macroeconomic or company-specific factors, there are some you want to buy and some blue-chip stocks to sell.For example, blue-chip retailer Target (NYSE:TGT) sits 45% below its 52-week high, weighed down by inflationary pressures and margin compression. And pharmaceutical giant Pfizer (NYSE:PFE) is 30% below its high on concerns of a slowdown in growth predominately due to lower Covid-19 vaccine sales.So, investors need to carry out due diligence even with blue chips. Today’s list of blue-chip stocks to sell in October contains popular names that are likely to correct or correct even further.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsPEPPepsiCo$163.26COSTCostco Wholesale$472.27FCXFreeport-McMoRan$27.35OXYOccidental Petroleum$61.43PepsiCo (PEP)PepsiCo building in Russia. PEP stock.Source: 8ED8 / ShutterstockPepsiCo (NASDAQ:PEP) stock is up 11% over the past year, bucking the broader bear market, and it throws off a healthy 2.7% dividend yield. However, shares look expensive with a forward price-earnings ratio of 22.8.PepsiCo is likely to see decelerating growth or margin pressure in the coming quarters. The company is reportedly considering cost-cutting measures, including layoffs and buyouts for some employees over 55. Shares have fallen around 3% since the story broke. A confirmation from the company could trigger panic selling.It’s also worth noting that Pepsi has finally stopped production in Russia. The country happens to be the company’s second-largest international market after Mexico. The implication of the production halt on growth remains to be seen.Amid these uncertainties, PEP stock’s valuation looks stretched and shares are likely to correct in the near term. Having said that, a 15% to 20% correction from current levels to the $130s would be a good time to consider some bullish exposure.Story continuesCostco Wholesale (COST)A Costco Wholesale (COST) warehouse in Auburn Hills, Michigan.Source: ilzesgimene / Shutterstock.comIn the long term, Costco Wholesale (NASDAQ:COST) is possibly the best bet among retail stocks. The company has built a strong omnichannel sales presence. Rising member fees are likely to support cash flow, and comparable-store sales have been rising. However, I remain cautious in the near term.COST stock has been resilient in the face of the bear market, up 6% over the past year. Yet, with a forward price-earnings ratio of 33.9, shares look relatively expensive amid mounting economic uncertainties including the possibility of a recession in the U.S. in 2023. The impact of aggressive interest rate hikes on consumer spending remains to be seen. I also expect Costco to face margin pressure in a slowdown or recession scenario.Those who wish to go long COST stock are likely to get a much better entry point after shares correct.Freeport-McMoRan (FCX)Freeport-McMoRan Stock's Long List of Catalysts Boosts Its Buy StatusSource: 360b / Shutterstock.comDoctor copper has continued to weaken due to two factors. First and foremost, the U.S. dollar has been gaining strength. Second, global economic uncertainty is likely to translate into lower copper demand. In this scenario, I would avoid miner Freeport-McMoRan (NYSE:FCX).FCX stock is 15.6% lower over the past year, slightly better than the S&amp;P 500’s 17.7% decline. However, in the event of a global recession, FCX stock is likely to correct further. While its forward price-earnings ratio of 13.1 is well below the broader market index’s forward P/E of 17.9, keep in mind that, in general, cyclical stocks tend to have a lower price-earnings ratio.In terms of business fundamentals, Freeport-McMoRan has utilized the copper bull market to strengthen its balance sheet. At the end of the second quarter, the company had just $1.6 billion in net debt. While management expects copper sales to increase in 2023, this may be offset by lower prices.In short, this doesn’t look like the ideal time to jump into a copper play. Those who wait for a further correction will likely be rewarded for their patience.Occidental Petroleum (OXY)A magnifying glass zooms in on the Occidental Petroleum website.Source: Pavel Kapysh / Shutterstock.comOccidental Petroleum (NYSE:OXY) is on my list of blue-chip stocks to sell because it has gotten much too far ahead of itself, with shares nearly doubling in the past year. Much of this investor enthusiasm has been due to the fact that Warren Buffett continues to buy up shares despite falling oil prices. Lower oil prices will translate into EBITDA margin compression on a relative basis in the coming quarters.Now, I don’t expect a big plunge in oil prices in the coming quarters even if we enter a recession. However, based on how far OXY stock has run over the past 12 months, there appears to be much more downside risk than upside potential at the current level, especially if oil prices continue to trend lower.I’m not the only one who thinks this. Analysts from Citigroup and JPMorgan both have “neutral” ratings on the stock due to what they see as capped upside over the next few months.That said, I like the fact that Occidental is focused on deleveraging. In the next few years, the company is likely to have an investment-grade balance sheet. This will provide greater headroom for dividend growth and share repurchases.Yet, while Buffett may have pockets deep enough to ride out a big correction in the stock, individual investors may not feel the same way.On the date of publication, Faisal Humayun did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

Here is what the firm has to say:“General Electric Company (NYSE:GE) – Aviation, Healthcare and Power conglomerate GE was punished in the quarter amid top-down economic fears for this collection of seemingly cyclical businesses. However, the market is not giving the company credit for the material improvements CEO Larry Culp has made in his tenure. The balance sheet today is stronger than it has been in a very long time, and each of the three primary business segments each have strong paths to increasing earnings, regardless of the economic environment. Healthcare has historically not been a cyclical business. While Aviation typically has some economic sensitivity, the business still has a strong COVID rebound tailwind that should continue even in an uncertain environment. Power is a less cyclical business, and GE maintains a steady business servicing approximately one-third of the world’s electricity. GE is another example of strong insider buying indicating management’s confidence in the business, while the company also began buying back discounted shares. GE is still on track to break the company into three separate businesses, and we believe this will help the market properly weigh the value of each core segment.”8.

340,528b4289-0a26-358d-ae50-4e3763a3e56e,PEP,2022-10-04,4 Blue-Chip Stocks to Sell in October,InvestorPlace,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/4-blue-chip-stocks-sell-211755531.html,1664572675,STORY,"['TGT', 'OXY', 'FCX', 'COST', 'PEP']","[In general, when markets trend lower, it makes sense to invest in blue-chip stocks. They tend to have a low beta and also provide regular cash flows through dividends. Yet, not all blue chips are created equal. Based on macroeconomic or company-specific factors, there are some you want to buy and some blue-chip stocks to sell.For example, blue-chip retailer Target (NYSE:TGT) sits 45% below its 52-week high, weighed down by inflationary pressures and margin compression. And pharmaceutical giant Pfizer (NYSE:PFE) is 30% below its high on concerns of a slowdown in growth predominately due to lower Covid-19 vaccine sales.So, investors need to carry out due diligence even with blue chips. Today’s list of blue-chip stocks to sell in October contains popular names that are likely to correct or correct even further.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsPEPPepsiCo$163.26COSTCostco Wholesale$472.27FCXFreeport-McMoRan$27.35OXYOccidental Petroleum$61.43PepsiCo (PEP)PepsiCo building in Russia. PEP stock.Source: 8ED8 / ShutterstockPepsiCo (NASDAQ:PEP) stock is up 11% over the past year, bucking the broader bear market, and it throws off a healthy 2.7% dividend yield. However, shares look expensive with a forward price-earnings ratio of 22.8.PepsiCo is likely to see decelerating growth or margin pressure in the coming quarters. The company is reportedly considering cost-cutting measures, including layoffs and buyouts for some employees over 55. Shares have fallen around 3% since the story broke. A confirmation from the company could trigger panic selling.It’s also worth noting that Pepsi has finally stopped production in Russia. The country happens to be the company’s second-largest international market after Mexico. The implication of the production halt on growth remains to be seen.Amid these uncertainties, PEP stock’s valuation looks stretched and shares are likely to correct in the near term. Having said that, a 15% to 20% correction from current levels to the $130s would be a good time to consider some bullish exposure.Story continuesCostco Wholesale (COST)A Costco Wholesale (COST) warehouse in Auburn Hills, Michigan.Source: ilzesgimene / Shutterstock.comIn the long term, Costco Wholesale (NASDAQ:COST) is possibly the best bet among retail stocks. The company has built a strong omnichannel sales presence. Rising member fees are likely to support cash flow, and comparable-store sales have been rising. However, I remain cautious in the near term.COST stock has been resilient in the face of the bear market, up 6% over the past year. Yet, with a forward price-earnings ratio of 33.9, shares look relatively expensive amid mounting economic uncertainties including the possibility of a recession in the U.S. in 2023. The impact of aggressive interest rate hikes on consumer spending remains to be seen. I also expect Costco to face margin pressure in a slowdown or recession scenario.Those who wish to go long COST stock are likely to get a much better entry point after shares correct.Freeport-McMoRan (FCX)Freeport-McMoRan Stock's Long List of Catalysts Boosts Its Buy StatusSource: 360b / Shutterstock.comDoctor copper has continued to weaken due to two factors. First and foremost, the U.S. dollar has been gaining strength. Second, global economic uncertainty is likely to translate into lower copper demand. In this scenario, I would avoid miner Freeport-McMoRan (NYSE:FCX).FCX stock is 15.6% lower over the past year, slightly better than the S&amp;P 500’s 17.7% decline. However, in the event of a global recession, FCX stock is likely to correct further. While its forward price-earnings ratio of 13.1 is well below the broader market index’s forward P/E of 17.9, keep in mind that, in general, cyclical stocks tend to have a lower price-earnings ratio.In terms of business fundamentals, Freeport-McMoRan has utilized the copper bull market to strengthen its balance sheet. At the end of the second quarter, the company had just $1.6 billion in net debt. While management expects copper sales to increase in 2023, this may be offset by lower prices.In short, this doesn’t look like the ideal time to jump into a copper play. Those who wait for a further correction will likely be rewarded for their patience.Occidental Petroleum (OXY)A magnifying glass zooms in on the Occidental Petroleum website.Source: Pavel Kapysh / Shutterstock.comOccidental Petroleum (NYSE:OXY) is on my list of blue-chip stocks to sell because it has gotten much too far ahead of itself, with shares nearly doubling in the past year. Much of this investor enthusiasm has been due to the fact that Warren Buffett continues to buy up shares despite falling oil prices. Lower oil prices will translate into EBITDA margin compression on a relative basis in the coming quarters.Now, I don’t expect a big plunge in oil prices in the coming quarters even if we enter a recession. However, based on how far OXY stock has run over the past 12 months, there appears to be much more downside risk than upside potential at the current level, especially if oil prices continue to trend lower.I’m not the only one who thinks this. Analysts from Citigroup and JPMorgan both have “neutral” ratings on the stock due to what they see as capped upside over the next few months.That said, I like the fact that Occidental is focused on deleveraging. In the next few years, the company is likely to have an investment-grade balance sheet. This will provide greater headroom for dividend growth and share repurchases.Yet, while Buffett may have pockets deep enough to ride out a big correction in the stock, individual investors may not feel the same way.On the date of publication, Faisal Humayun did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

341,047c71f9-0455-37bc-a864-cbadfa719f7d,UNP,2022-10-04,Norfolk Southern (NSC) Strong on Dividends Despite Cost Woes,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/norfolk-southern-nsc-strong-dividends-150003013.html,1664809203,STORY,"['NSC', 'CSX', 'UNP']","[Norfolk Southern’s NSC efforts to reward its shareholders through dividends and buybacks are encouraging. However, high fuel costs are concerning as the same is limiting bottom-line growth.Factors Favoring NSCWe are impressed with Norfolk Southern's efforts to reward its shareholders through dividends and buybacks. In January 2022, NSC’s board announced a 14% increase in its quarterly dividend payout, taking the total to $1.24 per share. This was the third dividend hike approval in a year’s time.A strong free cash flow generating ability supports NSC's shareholder-friendly activities. In 2021, Norfolk Southern generated a free cash flow of $2,785 million, up 30% year over year. In first-half 2022, free cash flow was $1,174 million.Driven by strong freight demand, revenues are likely to have been impressive in third-quarter 2022. Owing to upbeat revenues, operating ratio (operating expenses as a percentage of revenues) is likely to have improved year over year in the September quarter.Key RisksFuel expenses represent a key input cost for any transportation player, and Norfolk Southern is no exception. The current scenario of increasing fuel costs does not bode well as far as bottom-line growth is concerned. At NSC, fuel costs surged 94% year over year in first-half 2022, inducing a 17% rise in operating costs.Norfolk Southern is also being hurt by headwinds like supply-chain disruptions and slower network velocity. Due to these headwinds, overall volumes declined 3% year over year in the June quarter. Volumes contracted in first-quarter 2022 as well.High Fuel Costs a Bane for Other Railroads TooThanks to the northward movement in oil price (up 48% in first-half 2022) induced by the Russia-Ukraine war, fuel expenses are on the rise, hurting bottom-line growth of not only Norfolk Southern but other railroads like Union Pacific Corporation UNP and CSX Corporation CSX as well.At Union Pacific, fuel expenses escalated 82% in first-half 2022, causing a 20% jump in operating costs. The increase in operating costs affected the key efficiency metric of operating ratio (operating expenses as a % of revenues) to the tune of 130 basis points in the June quarter.Story continuesFuel costs are likely to be high in the September quarter as well. Results will be out on Oct 20. High capital expenditures may also be a downside as far as Union Pacific’s bottom line is concerned in the third quarter.At CSX, operating expenses increased 41% year over year in first-half 2022, mainly due to the 102% rise in fuel expenses. The increase in fuel costs was due to the steep rise in highway diesel fuel prices and the addition of non-locomotive fuel used for trucking. Costs are likely to be high in the September quarter too. Detailed results will be out on Oct 20.Like UNP, capital expenditures are high at CSX. In 2021, CSX’s capital expenditures were $1.79 billion, higher than $1.63 billion in 2020.  For 2022, CSX expects capital expenditures to increase to approximately $2 billion.

The free community event included fitness classes, health screenings, wellness classes, community resources, live entertainment, children's activities, and food distribution from the San Antonio Food Bank.Chad Richards, Vice President and General Manager of the Southwest Region, Quest, and Paul Gross, Sales Director, Southwest Region, Quest, attended the event to show support and connect with leaders from SAHRC and the local community.""To see how Quest's commitment to our local community plays out is deeply satisfying,"" said Paul. ""Chad and I met a dedicated group of individuals devoted to bringing awareness around chronic diseases and changing the outlook for those who are sometimes underrepresented. The SAHRC team, led by founder Dr. Roberto Trevino, expressed the impact Quest's support has had on their program and were excited to have us attend their event so we could experience firsthand the important work they do to support the local community.""Chad added, ""The Quest Diagnostics Foundation has been supporting Dr. Trevino in digitizing health education materials. This is helping bring this education to more communities of color, including young students. If we can educate young students on eating habits, their lifestyle, and health choices, we may be able to reduce the incidence of diabetes and other chronic conditions associated with being overweight.""Childhood obesity has disproportionately affected Black and Hispanic communities, partly due to social determinants such as low household income or lack of access to affordable healthy food. To help address these kinds of inequities, which constitute a preventable crisis in these communities, SAHRC developed the Bienestar/Neema Coordinated School Health Program, an evidence-based program using an innovative digitized curriculum designed to engage children and increase accessibility. The program has been recognized by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the National Institutes of Health (NIH).Story continuesThe Quest Diagnostics Foundation is collaborating with SAHRC to bring the culturally relevant curriculum to schools and communities where it is most needed, first in Texas and now in Paterson, New Jersey. Quest Diagnostics (NYSE: DGX) and The Quest Diagnostics Foundation are supporting this effort as part of Quest for Health Equity (Q4HE), a multi-year initiative, focused on providing a combination of donated testing services, education programs, and funding to support initiatives to close the gap in healthcare disparities in underserved communities across the U.S.""Through the grant opportunity from The Quest Diagnostics Foundation, we will be able to provide this digital supplemental resource to our 72 campuses,"" said Raul Salazar, Director of Health and Physical Education, San Antonio Independent School District (SAISD). ""At SAISD, we will use this program throughout the school year in our kindergarten through eighth-grade health classes, physical education classes, and our community outreach. We will also measure the growth of knowledge to see the change in self-efficacy in our children and community.

344,49089c80-fd25-3eee-9113-db796864f1bd,DGX,2022-10-04,Quest Diagnostics (DGX) & Peers Progress With Monkeypox Testing,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/quest-diagnostics-dgx-peers-progress-133501044.html,1664804101,STORY,"['DGX', 'LH', 'QGEN']","[Quest Diagnostics DGX, just like its industry peers, is progressing in terms of monkeypox virus test development. While the FDA is going all out to increase monkeypox testing capacity and access across the United States, the company in September received FDA’s emergency use authorization (EUA) for its proprietary monkeypox test.This came on the heels of the Department of Health and Human Services’ declaration (on Sep 7) to allow the FDA Commissioner issue a EUA for in-vitro diagnostics to expand the availability of tests for monkeypox. Following this, the FDA issued new guidance, outlining the agency’s current view regarding enforcement policies, recommendations for EUA requests for monkeypox diagnostic tests and its plans to prioritize the review of EUA requests.Quest Diagnostics in its latest media report released on Sep 15 noted that demand for COVID-19 molecular diagnostic testing declined in August compared to the prior month. However, at the same time, its Monkeypox Virus Qualitative Real-Time PCR, being the first lab-developed test to get an EUA specifically for monkeypox virus DNA detection, should get huge market acceptance amid the ongoing public health emergency. We believe this should compensate the shortfall in testing demand in the coming days.Here's How DGX Peers are Dealing With MonkeypoxQIAGEN N.V. QGEN recently launched the QIAstat-Dx Viral Vesicular Panel RUO— the first syndromic test that can distinguish between monkeypox and five other pathogens causing similar symptoms. This launch is part of QIAGEN’s efforts to combat the spread of monkeypox, which has been recently declared a public health emergency by the World Health Organization (WHO) and the U.S. government.This novel research use only (RUO) panel is available in cartridge form that can be run on QIAGEN’s QIAstat-Dx automated syndromic testing devices. The panel’s RUO status indicates that it can only be used for the surveillance of monkeypox cases at present and not for screening or diagnostics purposes. However, the company is prepared to make applications for clinical use if authorities in the United States and the European Union open new diagnostic pathways in response to the public health emergency.Story continuesLaboratory Corporation of America Holdings LH, popularly known as LabCorp, initiated monkeypox testing. This test is performed using the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s (CDC) orthopoxvirus test, which detects all non-smallpox-related orthopoxviruses, including monkeypox. According to LabCorp, this effort is part of the CDC’s commitment to quickly increase monkeypox testing access and capacity in every community during the ongoing outbreak.This test for monkeypox has the ability to accept specimens from LabCorp customers as well as overflow from public laboratories across the United States using its significant transportation and logistics capabilities. LabCorp earlier expected to increase capacity to up to 10,000 tests per week, doubling the current capacity provided through CDC's Laboratory Response Network (LRN).Meanwhile, Becton, Dickinson and Company BDX or BD and CerTest Biotec in late September announced that their newly developed molecular polymerase chain reaction assay for monkeypox virus is now commercially available globally, including in the United States, for research use only applications by laboratories. BD is currently working to submit a clinical test for the monkeypox virus for emergency used authorization as soon as possible, based on the guidance issued by the FDA on Sep 7.Industry ProspectsGoing by a Data Bridge Market Research analyses report, the monkeypox market is expected to witness significant growth during 2022-2029. The expected CAGR of the global monkeypox market is around 5.40% for the forecast period.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

346,067639b9-c08f-3def-a8d8-0fc433bf732f,CSCO,2022-10-04,"Cisco Systems, Inc.'s (NASDAQ:CSCO) Fundamentals Look Pretty Strong: Could The Market Be Wrong About The Stock?",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/cisco-systems-inc-nasdaq-csco-110052263.html,1664881252,STORY,['CSCO'],"[It is hard to get excited after looking at Cisco Systems' (NASDAQ:CSCO) recent performance, when its stock has declined 7.4% over the past month. However, a closer look at its sound financials might cause you to think again. Given that fundamentals usually drive long-term market outcomes, the company is worth looking at. Particularly, we will be paying attention to Cisco Systems'  ROE today.Return on Equity or ROE is a test of how effectively a company is growing its value and managing investors’ money. Put another way, it reveals the company's success at turning shareholder investments into profits. View our latest analysis for Cisco Systems How Is ROE Calculated?The formula for return on equity is:Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' EquitySo, based on the above formula, the ROE for Cisco Systems is:30% = US$12b ÷ US$40b (Based on the trailing twelve months to July 2022).The 'return' is the profit over the last twelve months. So, this means that for every $1 of its shareholder's investments, the company generates a profit of $0.30.What Is The Relationship Between ROE And Earnings Growth?So far, we've learned that ROE is a measure of a company's profitability. Depending on how much of these profits the company reinvests or ""retains"", and how effectively it does so, we are then able to assess a company’s earnings growth potential. Assuming everything else remains unchanged, the higher the ROE and profit retention, the higher the growth rate of a company compared to companies that don't necessarily bear these characteristics.Cisco Systems' Earnings Growth And 30% ROEFirstly, we acknowledge that Cisco Systems has a significantly high ROE. Additionally, the company's ROE is higher compared to the industry average of 11% which is quite remarkable. This probably laid the groundwork for Cisco Systems' moderate 18% net income growth seen over the past five years.As a next step, we compared Cisco Systems' net income growth with the industry and found that the company has a similar growth figure when compared with the industry average growth rate of 17% in the same period.Story continuespast-earnings-growthEarnings growth is an important metric to consider when valuing a stock. It’s important for an investor to know whether the market has priced in the company's expected earnings growth (or decline). Doing so will help them establish if the stock's future looks promising or ominous. If you're wondering about Cisco Systems''s valuation, check out this gauge of its price-to-earnings ratio, as compared to its industry.Is Cisco Systems Efficiently Re-investing Its Profits?The high three-year median payout ratio of 54% (or a retention ratio of 46%) for Cisco Systems suggests that the company's growth wasn't really hampered despite it returning most of its income to its shareholders.Additionally, Cisco Systems has paid dividends over a period of at least ten years which means that the company is pretty serious about sharing its profits with shareholders. Upon studying the latest analysts' consensus data, we found that the company's future payout ratio is expected to drop to 41% over the next three years. Regardless, the ROE is not expected to change much for the company despite the lower expected payout ratio.ConclusionOverall, we are quite pleased with Cisco Systems' performance. Especially the high ROE, Which has contributed to the impressive growth seen in earnings. Despite the company reinvesting only a small portion of its profits, it still has managed to grow its earnings so that is appreciable. With that said, the latest industry analyst forecasts reveal that the company's earnings growth is expected to slow down.
