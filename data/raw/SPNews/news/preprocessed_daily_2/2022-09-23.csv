1,05c167a0-246d-3333-a7ec-5fcebc4c6e45,SCHW,2022-09-23,Is Schwab Fundamental U.S. Small Company Index ETF (FNDA) a Strong ETF Right Now?,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/schwab-fundamental-u-small-company-102010204.html,1663928410,STORY,"['SCHW', '^RUT']","[The Schwab Fundamental U.S. Small Company Index ETF (FNDA) was launched on 08/13/2013, and is a smart beta exchange traded fund designed to offer broad exposure to the Style Box - Small Cap Value category of the market.What Are Smart Beta ETFs?Products that are based on market cap weighted indexes, which are strategies designed to reflect a specific market segment or the market as a whole, have traditionally dominated the ETF industry.Market cap weighted indexes work great for investors who believe in market efficiency. They provide a low-cost, convenient and transparent way of replicating market returns.But, there are some investors who would rather invest in smart beta funds; these funds track non-cap weighted strategies, and are a strong option for those who prefer choosing great stocks in order to beat the market.This kind of index follows this same mindset, as it attempts to pick stocks that have better chances of risk-return performance; non-cap weighted strategies base selection on certain fundamental characteristics, or a mix of such characteristics.Even though this space provides many choices to investors--think one of the simplest methodologies like equal-weighting and more complicated ones like fundamental and volatility/momentum based weighting--not all have been able to deliver first-rate results.Fund Sponsor &amp; IndexFNDA is managed by Charles Schwab, and this fund has amassed over $5.21 billion, which makes it one of the largest ETFs in the Style Box - Small Cap Value. This particular fund, before fees and expenses, seeks to match the performance of the Russell RAFI US Small Co. Index.The Russell RAFI US Small Company Index measures the performance of the small company size segment by fundamental overall company scores.Cost &amp; Other ExpensesExpense ratios are an important factor in the return of an ETF and in the long-term, cheaper funds can significantly outperform their more expensive cousins, other things remaining the same.Story continuesOperating expenses on an annual basis are 0.25% for this ETF, which makes it on par with most peer products in the space.The fund has a 12-month trailing dividend yield of 1.63%.Sector Exposure and Top HoldingsEven though ETFs offer diversified exposure which minimizes single stock risk, it is still important to look into a fund's holdings before investing. Luckily, most ETFs are very transparent products that disclose their holdings on a daily basis.This ETF has heaviest allocation in the Industrials sector - about 18.40% of the portfolio. Financials and Consumer Discretionary round out the top three.Taking into account individual holdings, Diamondback Energy Inc (FANG) accounts for about 0.46% of the fund's total assets, followed by First Citizens Bancshares Inc Clas (FCNCA) and Patterson Uti Energy Inc (PTEN).Its top 10 holdings account for approximately 3.42% of FNDA's total assets under management.Performance and RiskThe ETF has lost about -19.82% and is down about -13.34% so far this year and in the past one year (as of 09/23/2022), respectively. FNDA has traded between $44.28 and $57.77 during this last 52-week period.The ETF has a beta of 1.17 and standard deviation of 30.45% for the trailing three-year period, making it a medium risk choice in the space. With about 983 holdings, it effectively diversifies company-specific risk.AlternativesSchwab Fundamental U.S. Small Company Index ETF is a reasonable option for investors seeking to outperform the Style Box - Small Cap Value segment of the market. However, there are other ETFs in the space which investors could consider.IShares Russell 2000 Value ETF (IWN) tracks Russell 2000 Value Index and the Vanguard SmallCap Value ETF (VBR) tracks CRSP U.S. Small Cap Value Index. IShares Russell 2000 Value ETF has $11.44 billion in assets, Vanguard SmallCap Value ETF has $21.84 billion. IWN has an expense ratio of 0.23% and VBR charges 0.07%.Investors looking for cheaper and lower-risk options should consider traditional market cap weighted ETFs that aim to match the returns of the Style Box - Small Cap Value.Bottom LineTo learn more about this product and other ETFs, screen for products that match your investment objectives and read articles on latest developments in the ETF investing universe, please visit Zacks ETF Center.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Today's Research Daily features new research reports on 16 major stocks, including BHP Group Limited (BHP), United Parcel Service, Inc. (UPS) and Adobe Inc. (ADBE). These research reports have been hand-picked from the roughly 70 reports published by our analyst team today.You can see all of today’s research reports here &gt;&gt;&gt;BHP Group shares have declined -7% over the past year against the Zacks Mining - Miscellaneous industry’s decline of -15.5% and the S&amp;P 500 index's -16.1% decline. The outlook for BHP's commodities remains favorable, notwithstanding near-term macroeconomic headwinds, particularly the uncertain outlook for China. The recent pullback in iron ore prices nothwithstanding, the Zacks analyst expects the commodity regain ground in the medium to long run on pent-up demand in the automotive sector, infrastructure and the housing market. Copper and nickel prices will also be fueled by demand for electric vehicles.  BHP will benefit from its efforts to make operations more efficient through smart technology adoption across the entire value chain. Investment in growth projects with a particular focus on commodities like copper, nickel and potash will aid growth as well. The company’s iron ore production guidance for fiscal 2023 is 249-260 Mt.

Even though economies are reopening, the urge for online shopping refuses to relent among consumers. High shipping rates also bode well for UPS. Moreover, its strong free cash flow generating ability pleases us and supports UPS' shareholder-friendly activities.In first-half 2022, UPS generated a free cash flow of $6,895 million compared with $6,804 million in first-half 2021. UPS paid out dividends worth $3,437 million in 2021, up 1.9% year over year.

The Figma acquisition has also weighed on the stock lately, as the market sees the purchase price to be on the high side. Story continuesAdobe's Creative Cloud, Document Cloud and Adobe Experience Cloud products drove the top-line growth in the quarterly report. Further, rising subscription revenues and solid momentum across the mobile apps remained major positives. Growth in emerging markets, robust online video creation demand and solid adoption of Acrobat are tailwinds.Also, continued key customer wins of the company are contributing well.

However, to meet the rising demand for its wafer products, onsemi constructed a new building that is set to expand SiC production capacity by 16 times. So far, ON has invested more than $150 million in the Roznov site and will be looking to spend an additional $300 million through 2023.onesmi signed long-term supply agreements with various customers for the next three years, which helped it secure more than $4 billion of committed SiC revenues. To drive its SiC revenues, onsemi is rapidly expanding capacity across new sites like Roznov, Czech Republic.ON initiated its capacity expansion to capitalize on the uptrend in the high-growth markets like electric vehicles (EV), ADAS, and energy infrastructure and factory automation.ON Semiconductor Corporation Price and ConsensusON Semiconductor Corporation Price and ConsensusON Semiconductor Corporation price-consensus-chart | ON Semiconductor Corporation Quoteonsemi Production Capacity Expansion Aids Sharesonsemi has been expanding its SiC facilities globally and internationally to diversify its product portfolio. onesmi generates a significant percentage of revenues from the computing, consumer, industrial, communications and automotive markets.Onsemi also recently expanded its Hudson, NH facility, which will increase SiC boule production capacity by five times year over year. This will aid in meeting the rising demand for SiC-based solutions, which is critical for developing EVs and energy infrastructure and is an important contributor to decarbonization.Per onsemi, the SiC total addressable market is projected to grow from $2 billion in 2021 to $6.5 billion in 2026, at a CAGR of 33%.Story continuesonsemi, which currently carries Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), is also looking to expand the 200-millimeter SiC capacity at its existing fabs and double the front-end wafer capacity by the end of 2023 from the year-ago period, besides further doubling that capacity by 2024 end.

7,4db3ce99-f0cd-3569-b5a6-0104cc3bd065,TXN,2022-09-23,3 Stocks to Watch That Recently Hiked Their Dividends,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/3-stocks-watch-recently-hiked-121612174.html,1663848972,STORY,"['MSFT', 'TXN', 'KDP']","[Soaring inflation has been the biggest concern for the American economy that’s been affecting markets for months. The Fed has so far struggled to get a firm grip on rising inflation despite multiple rate hikes. On Sep 21, the Fed increased interest rates for the fourth time this year in its bid to control surging inflation.However, the crisis is far from over as the Fed has indicated more interest rate hikes in the coming months, or at least till sky-high commodity prices don’t cool off to the desired levels.Another Interest Rate HikeThe Fed, on Sep 21, hiked interest rates by 75 basis points, its fourth hike this year. This takes the total hike to 300 basis points so far this year to a target range of 3% to 3.25%. However, this is not the end as the struggle to tame rising inflation continues.The Fed has also hinted at raising interest rates by another 125 basis points by the year-end. That would take the benchmark interest rate to a midpoint of 4.4% by the end of this year. Moreover, the central bank has indicated that it doesn’t plan to cut interest rates till 2024.The move doesn’t come as a surprise given that Fed Chair Jerome Powell had earlier shared similar hawkish views toward hiking rates.Inflationary pressures have been taking a toll on stocks since the beginning of the year. Markets managed to end in the green only in March and July in the first eight months of the year. September is historically known as one of the worst-performing months for markets. This time it has been worse, with the month starting with severe volatility after the two-month-long summer rally evaporated in August.Investors were initially expecting a not-so-steep rate hike, which fueled the summer rally but the positive sentiment was dampened by the hotter-than-expected inflation reading in August. Powell added to the gloom by commenting that the central bank will continue to hike interest aggressively so long it gets full control over soaring inflation.Story continuesThe unexpected jump in the consumer price index in August gave Fed the perfect cover to go for another steep rate hike.In fact, Powell’s comments following Wednesday’s rate hike indicate further hikes in the coming months. The Fed’s aggressive monetary policy has instilled fears of an economic slowdown in the minds of investors.Higher interest rates mean a higher cost of borrowing, which increases the chances of an economic slowdown. Both are negative signs for the markets, which have already experienced volatility this year. Stock prices are still being affected by worries of an economic slowdown.Stocks to WatchGiven this situation, investors should exercise caution and continue holding dividend-paying stocks to protect their portfolios. We think it's a good idea to consider stocks that have recently hiked their dividend payouts.

This move lagged the S&amp;P 500's daily loss of 0.84%. Elsewhere, the Dow lost 0.36%, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq lost 0.12%.Prior to today's trading, shares of the steel company had lost 20% over the past month.

9,141dd69b-c644-39aa-9cd8-0d10df6ae50e,NUE,2022-09-23,3 Reasons Growth Investors Will Love Nucor (NUE),Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/3-reasons-growth-investors-love-164504465.html,1663865104,STORY,['NUE'],"[Growth stocks are attractive to many investors, as above-average financial growth helps these stocks easily grab the market's attention and produce exceptional returns. But finding a growth stock that can live up to its true potential can be a tough task.In addition to volatility, these stocks carry above-average risk by their very nature. Also, one could end up losing from a stock whose growth story is actually over or nearing its end.However, it's pretty easy to find cutting-edge growth stocks with the help of the Zacks Growth Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which looks beyond the traditional growth attributes to analyze a company's real growth prospects.Nucor (NUE) is on the list of such stocks currently recommended by our proprietary system. In addition to a favorable Growth Score, it carries a top Zacks Rank.Research shows that stocks carrying the best growth features consistently beat the market. And for stocks that have a combination of a Growth Score of A or B and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy), returns are even better.Here are three of the most important factors that make the stock of this steel company a great growth pick right now.Earnings GrowthEarnings growth is arguably the most important factor, as stocks exhibiting exceptionally surging profit levels tend to attract the attention of most investors. And for growth investors, double-digit earnings growth is definitely preferable, and often an indication of strong prospects (and stock price gains) for the company under consideration.While the historical EPS growth rate for Nucor is 39.7%, investors should actually focus on the projected growth. The company's EPS is expected to grow 34.2% this year, crushing the industry average, which calls for EPS growth of -9.8%.Cash Flow GrowthWhile cash is the lifeblood of any business, higher-than-average cash flow growth is more important and beneficial for growth-oriented companies than for mature companies. That's because, growth in cash flow enables these companies to expand their businesses without depending on expensive outside funds.Story continuesRight now, year-over-year cash flow growth for Nucor is 326.4%, which is higher than many of its peers. In fact, the rate compares to the industry average of 253.3%.While investors should actually consider the current cash flow growth, it's worth taking a look at the historical rate too for putting the current reading into proper perspective. The company's annualized cash flow growth rate has been 38.7% over the past 3-5 years versus the industry average of 29.2%.Promising Earnings Estimate RevisionsSuperiority of a stock in terms of the metrics outlined above can be further validated by looking at the trend in earnings estimate revisions. A positive trend is of course favorable here. Empirical research shows that there is a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.The current-year earnings estimates for Nucor have been revising upward. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has surged 0.2% over the past month.Bottom LineWhile the overall earnings estimate revisions have made Nucor a Zacks Rank #2 stock, it has earned itself a Growth Score of A based on a number of factors, including the ones discussed above.You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.This combination positions Nucor well for outperformance, so growth investors may want to bet on it.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

10,50d12ec5-3549-3745-966a-8363ecfbf416,NUE,2022-09-23,"After Plunging 20% in 4 Weeks, Here's Why the Trend Might Reverse for Nucor (NUE)",Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/plunging-20-4-weeks-heres-133501065.html,1663853701,STORY,['NUE'],"[A downtrend has been apparent in Nucor (NUE) lately with too much selling pressure. The stock has declined 20% over the past four weeks. However, given the fact that it is now in oversold territory and Wall Street analysts are majorly in agreement about the company's ability to report better earnings than they predicted earlier, the stock could be due for a turnaround.Here is How to Spot Oversold StocksWe use Relative Strength Index (RSI), one of the most commonly used technical indicators, for spotting whether a stock is oversold. This is a momentum oscillator that measures the speed and change of price movements.RSI oscillates between zero and 100. Usually, a stock is considered oversold when its RSI reading falls below 30.Technically, every stock oscillates between being overbought and oversold irrespective of the quality of their fundamentals. And the beauty of RSI is that it helps you quickly and easily check if a stock's price is reaching a point of reversal.So, by this measure, if a stock has gotten too far below its fair value just because of unwarranted selling pressure, investors may start looking for entry opportunities in the stock for benefitting from the inevitable rebound.However, like every investing tool, RSI has its limitations, and should not be used alone for making an investment decision.Why a Trend Reversal is Due for NUEThe heavy selling of NUE shares appears to be in the process of exhausting itself, as indicated by its RSI reading of 29.14. So, the trend for the stock could reverse soon for reaching the old equilibrium of supply and demand.This technical indicator is not the only factor that calls for a potential rebound for the stock. There is a fundamental indicator as well. A strong agreement among sell-side analysts covering NUE in raising earnings estimates for the current year has led to an increase in the consensus EPS estimate by 0.2% over the last 30 days. And an upward trend in earnings estimate revisions usually translates into price appreciation in the near term.Moreover, NUE currently has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), which means it is in the top 20% of more than the 4,000 stocks that we rank based on trends in earnings estimate revisions and EPS surprises. This is a more conclusive indication of the stock's potential turnaround in the near term.

The company’s cyber-business performance is expected to have been driven by higher uptake of products like Protect, EPP and Guard Managed Service.The company’s IoT business is likely to have been negatively impacted by disruptions related to the global chip shortage.

However, when you're an income investor, your primary focus is generating consistent cash flow from each of your liquid investments.While cash flow can come from bond interest or interest from other types of investments, income investors hone in on dividends. A dividend is that coveted distribution of a company's earnings paid out to shareholders, and investors often view it by its dividend yield, a metric that measures the dividend as a percent of the current stock price. Many academic studies show that dividends account for significant portions of long-term returns, with dividend contributions exceeding one-third of total returns in many cases.Unum in FocusUnum (UNM) is headquartered in Chattanooga, and is in the Finance sector. The stock has seen a price change of 62.51% since the start of the year. Currently paying a dividend of $0.33 per share, the company has a dividend yield of 3.31%. In comparison, the Insurance - Accident and Health industry's yield is 1.64%, while the S&amp;P 500's yield is 1.77%.Looking at dividend growth, the company's current annualized dividend of $1.32 is up 12.8% from last year. Unum has increased its dividend 4 times on a year-over-year basis over the last 5 years for an average annual increase of 6.18%. Looking ahead, future dividend growth will be dependent on earnings growth and payout ratio, which is the proportion of a company's annual earnings per share that it pays out as a dividend. Unum's current payout ratio is 23%. This means it paid out 23% of its trailing 12-month EPS as dividend.Earnings growth looks solid for UNM for this fiscal year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2022 is $6.11 per share, representing a year-over-year earnings growth rate of 40.46%.Bottom LineInvestors like dividends for a variety of different reasons, from tax advantages and decreasing overall portfolio risk to considerably improving stock investing profits. But, not every company offers a quarterly payout.Big, established firms that have more secure profits are often seen as the best dividend options, but it's fairly uncommon to see high-growth businesses or tech start-ups offer their stockholders a dividend. Income investors have to be mindful of the fact that high-yielding stocks tend to struggle during periods of rising interest rates. That said, they can take comfort from the fact that UNM is not only an attractive dividend play, but also represents a compelling investment opportunity with a Zacks Rank of #1 (Strong Buy).Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

That's according to a new survey out of Stifel on consumer spending. Joining us now to add some insight is Stifel's managing director for the consumer and retail sector. That is Mark Astrachan.Good to see you, Mark. Thanks for being here. I want to start with some of these hiring plans before we really dig into the meat of the survey, which was very interesting. Target saying it's going to hire 100,000 folks. Walmart only 40,000. I mean, what can we, if anything, read into some of these plans?MARK ASTRACHAN: Yeah, thanks. Thanks for having me, first off. I think it's probably a little bit hard to read into the plans specifically because you just don't know necessarily what the hiring levels are behind those. But I think generally speaking, it's encouraging to see at least that they're looking to hire folks and that they're actually finding folks to actually hire because if you recall over the last year or so, it's been just a lot harder to find people to come into those jobs, given where unemployment is.And so I think they're basically trying to get what they can. I think probably the fact the numbers aren't exceedingly above where they've been in the last couple of years would suggest that they're probably in a pretty good spot at this point to be able to service the customer adequately.And just as an aside, but I think interesting, too, remember, a lot of the folks that they're hiring are not just doing kind of front of store, but they're also doing things behind the scenes to fulfill digital orders as well, like buy online, pickup in store, buy online, pickup in parking lot as an example. So you do need more folks than you did five years ago, but I think they're probably in a decent spot at this point.Story continuesBRAD SMITH: What does that tell you, though, about some of their margin compression, perhaps, what they're expecting, based on the hiring levels that they have set forth and because they are so dramatically different from last year?MARK ASTRACHAN: Well, I guess it's going to depend. Walmart's up 40,000, Target up 100,000. But again, kind of similar to the prior year and Walmart below. So I guess, on a net basis, that's probably better if you have fewer people versus the prior year. But this year, the margins are not just hiring of people. Of course, there's all the inflation overlying everything else that's going on. And so all these companies have just seen a massive pressure on cost.On top of that, the slowing of general merchandise discretionary, however you want to put it, category sales. In the fiscal second quarter, kind of May, June time frame, that obviously weighed on margins there. So the expectation would be that things get better from a margin standpoint relative to where the lows were earlier in the year. So not necessarily a comment on the year on year in the holiday period, but certainly better than where we were in the July quarter, for example.JULIE HYMAN: Yeah, and speaking of which as well, when we look at your spending survey, people in terms of their spending intentions, net discretionary spending intentions, you guys found, were up 10% in mid-September. That compares to about a 6% increase since June.And I guess you can account for some of that with the lower gasoline prices. I mean, how do you tease out these spending intentions and account for higher prices as a part of that? In other words, if you ask someone how much more do you expect to spend, how much of their answer depends on how much more they're going to have-- do they think they're going to have to spend on the same stuff?MARK ASTRACHAN: Yeah, it's a good question. It's not really one of those things that we get into a lot of specifics in asking folks what they think about the inflationary aspect of what they're spending relative to what they're actually spending. But inherent in that, obviously, is at least some level of inflationary pressure that goes into it. But I think, really, the high level just suggests that the consumer, regardless of what we're seeing and debating from a market and macro standpoint, that the consumer is actually feeling a little bit more robust or less influenced by kind of some of those higher level items.And to your point, I think the gas prices, it's really hard to kind of overstate what the impact was on higher prices in early June and, obviously, lower prices on a relative basis from there. And we asked the question on just how much impact you're seeing from gas prices on spending. And it's still inflated relative to historical levels. 60% of our respondents say that they're expecting some impact from their spending on gas prices, but that's down 10 points from where we were in June.And obviously, gas prices are down materially since June, still up about, I think, 15% or so year on year. So I think that's kind of what you're seeing here in terms of the overall spending. The lower gas prices really is helping the consumer kind of thinking about that.And the holiday spending kind of coupled with asking on back to school spending that we started in, I think, late July or early August, show that you're actually seeing two improving spending intentions on just back to school, but also on holiday, that those levels in terms of where back to school spending ended, which was down a couple of points versus a year ago, is much better than down high single digits, where we were in early August when we started asking that question.So I think you're kind of seeing the consumer spending appetite increases. Gas prices, in particular, come down. And then they're just dealing with inflation as they can. But there's not a lot you can do.BRAD SMITH: What type of divide in that spending and tension are you seeing among different income brackets, perhaps, and especially as we've seen a relative resiliency in some of the higher income spenders versus the rest of the market, the rest of the economy, and consumers that are trying to exactly determine where they can still spend on discretionary things versus kind of pulling it back in entirety. And is that starting to trickle into the higher income brackets as well?MARK ASTRACHAN: Yeah, it's actually really, really fascinating. So we take the income levels and kind of look at those questions that we ask-- a lot of the questions, but the very high level of spending, the high level of back to school and holiday. And what's really fascinating is, it's been ongoing for a while that those earning less than 75,000 per year have in absolute terms said they're going to spend less on a year on year basis. And that got worse as we went through spring and early summer, peaked or troughed in June from higher gas prices and has gotten better.So if you take a look at the most recent survey, those consumers, again, those earning less than 75,000 per year, say they're going to spend 17% less versus a year ago versus the overall 10% number that you said. So it obviously tells you how significantly up the spending intentions are for those earning more than that.And if you take a look at the back to school and holiday, the same dynamics play out where those earning less than 75,000 are going to spend less. But interestingly, holiday spending intentions were actually higher relative to overall spending in each income level, including those lower income consumers.So suggesting that the lower income consumers are going to spend less year on year, but they're actually spending less than just the overall-- or I should say, they're spending more than the overall discretionary spending. So they're still planning on spending more just in absolute terms on holiday. So somewhat encouraging there.And I'll just add, too, that if you look at that under 75,000 level that's, as I said, gotten better since June, I think that's probably the important takeaway here that that lower income consumer is feeling a little less pressure right now because the gas prices are.JULIE HYMAN: Where are all these people going to spend their money, Mark? Just real quickly, what's your pick going into the holiday season?MARK ASTRACHAN: I'm not sure I have one. But I think maybe broader strokes here, kind of punting the question, discretionary spending has obviously been pretty weak in the first part of this year. And so I think you're going to see that those categories that were most weak probably come back a little bit more as we head into holiday.BRAD SMITH: Stifel managing director Mark Astrachan joining us here today. Thanks so much for the survey, the insights, and breaking this down for us. Appreciate it.]"

32,bd5c9c68-9df9-329e-be23-3a91ac93257b,JWN,2022-09-23,Why Is Nordstrom (JWN) Up 4.1% Since Last Earnings Report?,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/why-nordstrom-jwn-4-1-153003242.html,1663860603,STORY,"['JWN', 'FL']","[It has been about a month since the last earnings report for Nordstrom (JWN). Shares have added about 4.1% in that time frame, outperforming the S&amp;P 500.Will the recent positive trend continue leading up to its next earnings release, or is Nordstrom due for a pullback? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at the most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important drivers.Nordstrom Q2 Earnings &amp; Revenues Beat on Solid DemandNordstrom posted impressive second-quarter fiscal 2022 results, wherein both top and bottom lines surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate and grew year over year. Results gained from double-digit growth in men's and shoes, and women's apparel and beauty as customers returned to occasions.Gains from strategic initiatives and strong Anniversary sales, driven by improved customer experience and increased engagement, bode well. Going into the second half of fiscal 2022, management expects to aggressively right-size its inventory, invest in its supply chain and enhance its merchandising capabilities.However, sluggish customer traffic and demand beginning in late June, particularly in Nordstrom Rack, acted as deterrents.Quarterly HighlightsNordstrom posted adjusted earnings of 81 cents per share, reflecting a sharp improvement from the year-ago figure of 49 cents. The metric also surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate as well as our estimate of 80 cents per share.Total revenues grew 12% year over year to $4,095 million and beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $3,966 million and our estimate of $3,970 million. This marked the eighth straight quarter of sequential top-line growth. Net sales advanced 12% year over year to $3,991 million and beat our estimate of $3,878.6 million. Credit Card net revenues grew 13% from the prior-year quarter to $104 million.For second-quarter fiscal 2022, net sales for the Nordstrom brand rose 14.7% year over year to $2,771 million and surpassed our estimate of $2,668.1 million. Sales for the Nordstrom Rack brand advanced 6.3% year over year to $1,220 million and beat our estimate of $1,210.5 million. Both Nordstrom and Nordstrom Rack brands exceeded the pre-pandemic levels.Digital sales rose 6.3% year over year, driven by the shift in the timing of the Anniversary Sale. For the fiscal second quarter, digital sales represented 38% of net sales.Nordstrom's gross profit margin expanded 65 basis points (bps) year over year to 35.2% for the reported quarter. This substantial growth resulted from reduced buying and occupancy costs, partly offset by higher markdown rates.Selling, general and administrative (“SG&amp;A”) expenses, as a percentage of sales, contracted 15 bps year over year to 32.8% for the fiscal second quarter, owing to robust sales growth.Earnings before interest and taxes (“EBIT”) of $202 million reflected growth from $151 million in the year-ago quarter. The increase mainly resulted from higher sales, which somewhat offset higher markdowns and rising labor costs. Adjusted EBIT was $210 million in the reported quarter.Story continuesOther FinancialsThe company ended second-quarter fiscal 2022 with a strong balance sheet. Available liquidity as of Jul 30, 2022, was $1.3 billion, including $494 million of cash and cash equivalents, and $800 million available in its revolving line of credit. It had long-term debt (net of current liabilities) of $2,853 million and total shareholders’ equity of $663 million.As of Jul 30, 2022, the company provided $373 million of net cash for operating activities and spent $215 million as capital expenditure.The company recently approved a dividend of 19 cents, payable Sep 14, to shareholders of record as of Aug 30. It also bought back 1.5 million shares worth $35 million, as part of its $500-million share repurchase program. Following this, JWN has $465 million available under the share repurchase authorization.OutlookDespite the solid quarterly results, management slashed the view for fiscal 2022 due to declining discretionary spending stemming from inflation. The company expects total year-over-year revenue growth of 5-7%, down from the aforementioned 6-8% rise. Adjusted earnings are envisioned to be $2.30-$2.60, which compares unfavorably with the prior stated $3.20-$3.50. The EBIT margin is likely to be 4.5-4.9%, down from the earlier mentioned 5.8-6.2%.Adjusted EBIT is expected to be 4.3-4.7%, down from the prior stated 5.6-6%. However, the metric suggests improvement from the 3.4% reported last year, driven by lower SG&amp;A costs. For fiscal 2022, the gross profit is envisioned to remain flat year over year. On the flip side, clearance activity and higher markdowns are likely to affect the gross profit by $200 million.For the fiscal third quarter, it expects a mid-single-digit decline in revenues, as evident from the demand deceleration we saw in the latter part of the second quarter. Also, the EBIT margin is likely to be down 200 bps year over year.How Have Estimates Been Moving Since Then?It turns out, estimates revision have trended downward during the past month.The consensus estimate has shifted -84.15% due to these changes.VGM ScoresAt this time, Nordstrom has a great Growth Score of A, though it is lagging a lot on the Momentum Score front with an F. However, the stock was allocated a grade of A on the value side, putting it in the top 20% for this investment strategy.Overall, the stock has an aggregate VGM Score of A. If you aren't focused on one strategy, this score is the one you should be interested in.OutlookEstimates have been broadly trending downward for the stock, and the magnitude of these revisions indicates a downward shift. Notably, Nordstrom has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). We expect an in-line return from the stock in the next few months.Performance of an Industry PlayerNordstrom is part of the Zacks Retail - Apparel and Shoes industry. Over the past month, Foot Locker (FL), a stock from the same industry, has gained 3%. The company reported its results for the quarter ended July 2022 more than a month ago.Foot Locker reported revenues of $2.07 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -9.2%. EPS of $1.10 for the same period compares with $2.21 a year ago.Foot Locker is expected to post earnings of $1.10 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -43%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -1%.The overall direction and magnitude of estimate revisions translate into a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for Foot Locker. Also, the stock has a VGM Score of D.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research? Today, you can download 7 Best Stocks for the Next 30 Days.

Total compensation budgets include other adjustments such as promotions and cost of living adjustments in addition to merit increases. Merit and total budget increases are up from 2.6 per cent and 2.8 per cent respectively in 2022. Across Canada, the highest increases in total budgets are in Montreal (4.5 per cent), Greater Edmonton (4.3 per cent), Saskatchewan (4.2 per cent) and Greater Calgary (4.1 per cent).The survey includes data from more than 550 organizations of varying sizes across 15 industries. You can review more of the survey findings here.While budgets are higher than recent years, planned increases will fall short of year over year inflation which hit a 40 year high of 8.1 per cent in June 2022, moderating to 7.6 per cent in July, and 7.0 per cent in August. Historically, organizations have relied on the labour market and competition for talent - not inflation - for shaping their compensation strategies. In this high inflation environment, the survey found that more than a third (34 per cent) of organizations are considering ad-hoc, off-cycle wage reviews or adjustments to combat turnover and recruiting challenges in key roles, up from 19 per cent in March of 2022.""High inflation is raising compensation expectations and salary projections of Canadian employees facing significant increases in their cost of living,"" said Elizabeth English, Principal, COE Industry Manager in Mercer Canada's Career Products business. ""With 2023 compensation budget increases falling well short of inflation, organizations need to focus on managing employee expectations with their internal communications, planning for multiple scenarios and adopting a broader total rewards perspective to attract and retain talent, which can include investing in their benefit programs.""Story continuesMany organizations are already enhancing their benefits programs to support their employee value proposition. This includes plan sponsors adding new coverages to support diversity, equity and inclusion strategies by providing gender affirmation and fertility coverage as well as providing allocations for adoption-related costs. Plan sponsors have also continued to invest in wellness, either by providing more mental health support and, or offering new digital well-being solutions. Additionally, personal spending accounts are gaining traction as they provide employees flexibility and  reimburse a wide-range of wellness-related expenses.To learn more about the survey results and gain insights directly from Mercer's business leaders, register for Mercer's signature event webinar: Reshaping the future: hot inflation or cool compensation? happening on Thursday, September 29.About MercerMercer believes in building brighter futures by redefining the world of work, reshaping retirement and investment outcomes, and unlocking real health and well-being.

While the stock has lost 10.4% over the past four weeks, there is light at the end of the tunnel as it is now in oversold territory and Wall Street analysts expect the company to report better earnings than they predicted earlier.Guide to Identifying Oversold StocksWe use Relative Strength Index (RSI), one of the most commonly used technical indicators, for spotting whether a stock is oversold. This is a momentum oscillator that measures the speed and change of price movements.RSI oscillates between zero and 100. Usually, a stock is considered oversold when its RSI reading falls below 30.Technically, every stock oscillates between being overbought and oversold irrespective of the quality of their fundamentals. And the beauty of RSI is that it helps you quickly and easily check if a stock's price is reaching a point of reversal.So, by this measure, if a stock has gotten too far below its fair value just because of unwarranted selling pressure, investors may start looking for entry opportunities in the stock for benefitting from the inevitable rebound.However, like every investing tool, RSI has its limitations, and should not be used alone for making an investment decision.Here's Why EQR Could Experience a TurnaroundThe heavy selling of EQR shares appears to be in the process of exhausting itself, as indicated by its RSI reading of 28.6. So, the trend for the stock could reverse soon for reaching the old equilibrium of supply and demand.3-month RSI Chart for EQRThis technical indicator is not the only factor that calls for a potential rebound for the stock. There is a fundamental indicator as well. A strong agreement among sell-side analysts covering EQR in raising earnings estimates for the current year has led to an increase in the consensus EPS estimate by 0% over the last 30 days. And an upward trend in earnings estimate revisions usually translates into price appreciation in the near term.Moreover, EQR currently has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), which means it is in the top 20% of more than the 4,000 stocks that we rank based on trends in earnings estimate revisions and EPS surprises. This is a more conclusive indication of the stock's potential turnaround in the near term.

Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: JPMorgan JPM, Bank of America BAC, Huntington Bancshares HBAN, BOK Financial Corp. BOKF and Zions Bancorp. ZION.Here are highlights from Thursday’s Analyst Blog:What's in Store for Banks as Fed Signals More Rate Hikes, Slowdown?In an unprecedented but unsurprising move, the Federal Reserve raised the interest rates by 75 basis points for the third consecutive time. Thus, the Fed fund rates now stand in the 3.0% to 3.25% range, the highest since 2008.Further, the central bank reiterated its aggressive stance to bring inflation down to its goal of 2%. The inflation number was quite high at 8.3% for August. The Fed Chair Jerome Powell, at the press conference, following the conclusion of the two-day FOMC meeting, said, “we are focused on... getting inflation back down to 2%. We can't fail to do that. I mean, if we were to fail to do that, that would be the thing that would be most painful for the people that we serve. So, for now, that has to be our overarching focus.”With this, the Fed officials now anticipate the interest rates to reach 4.4% by 2022-end (up from the June projection of 3.4%) and 4.6% by next year's end (up from the 3.8% projection). As interest income constitutes a major portion of banks’ revenues, higher interest rates, along with decent loan demand, will offer support. Hence, banks like JPMorgan, Bank of America, Huntington Bancshares, BOK Financial Corp. and Zions Bancorp. are expected to witness impressive top-line growth.When the Fed cut short-term interest rates to near-zero in March 2020 amid the pandemic, banks faced net interest margin (NIM) compression. Now, with the central bank raising rates, NIM is expected to witness further improvement. Even in the first half of 2022, banks including JPM, BAC, HBAN, ZION and BOKF recorded an increase in the NIM.Story continuesDespite this favorable development, there is a bit of concern for banks as the Fed provided a very grim economic picture. Powell noted that achieving a soft landing will be “very challenging.” Per the Fed’s latest Summary of Economic Projections, the U.S. economy will be slowing down this year, with just 0.2% growth compared with the previous expectation of 1.7% growth.Thus, this will present a daunting challenge for banks like JPMorgan, Bank of America, Huntington Bancshares, BOK Financial and Zions. Banks’ finances are tied to the health of the economy. As the economy slows down and demand for loans gradually wanes, banks’ earnings are likely to be adversely impacted to some extent.Hence, the situation for banks will be like a double-edged sword. But this shouldn’t drive the investors away from bank stocks.Over the past decade, several operating efficiency strengthening efforts and stringent regulatory capital requirements have made banks fundamentally stronger. Banks have moved away from risky operations and are now focused on bolstering core businesses.A conservative lending policy, higher interest rates and a strong balance sheet position will aid banks’ performance. Global diversification and changing the mix to focus more on other revenue sources, along with technological upgrades, will continue supporting banks’ profitability.Undoubtedly, the operating environment will get tough for banks in the coming days.

The newly-inaugurated hub will increase ON’s SiC wafer production capacity by five times year over year and address certain supply-chain bottlenecks.onsemi added its SiC-polished wafer and SiC epitaxy (EPI) wafer production facility to its existing SiC fab in the Czech Republic. However, to meet the rising demand for its wafer products, onsemi constructed a new building that is set to expand SiC production capacity by 16 times. So far, ON has invested more than $150 million in the Roznov site and will be looking to spend an additional $300 million through 2023.onesmi signed long-term supply agreements with various customers for the next three years, which helped it secure more than $4 billion of committed SiC revenues. To drive its SiC revenues, onsemi is rapidly expanding capacity across new sites like Roznov, Czech Republic.ON initiated its capacity expansion to capitalize on the uptrend in the high-growth markets like electric vehicles (EV), ADAS, and energy infrastructure and factory automation.ON Semiconductor Corporation Price and ConsensusON Semiconductor Corporation Price and ConsensusON Semiconductor Corporation price-consensus-chart | ON Semiconductor Corporation Quoteonsemi Production Capacity Expansion Aids Sharesonsemi has been expanding its SiC facilities globally and internationally to diversify its product portfolio. onesmi generates a significant percentage of revenues from the computing, consumer, industrial, communications and automotive markets.Onsemi also recently expanded its Hudson, NH facility, which will increase SiC boule production capacity by five times year over year. This will aid in meeting the rising demand for SiC-based solutions, which is critical for developing EVs and energy infrastructure and is an important contributor to decarbonization.Per onsemi, the SiC total addressable market is projected to grow from $2 billion in 2021 to $6.5 billion in 2026, at a CAGR of 33%.Story continuesonsemi, which currently carries Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), is also looking to expand the 200-millimeter SiC capacity at its existing fabs and double the front-end wafer capacity by the end of 2023 from the year-ago period, besides further doubling that capacity by 2024 end. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Further positively impacting onsemi’s decision to diversify its product portfolio and expand operations is President Biden's decision to sign the CHIPS and Science Act, supporting investments in domestic semiconductor manufacturing and reducing dependence on foreign markets like China. onsemi peer Microchip Technology MCHP is also looking to benefit from the recent declaration of the act by the government.The government's recent declaration will help Microchip diversify income from its microcontroller business, which is riddled with supply-chain disturbances. Microchip continues developing and introducing a wide range of innovative and proprietary new linear, mixed-signal, power, interface and timing products to spur growth in the analog business.However, ON is facing stiff competition from Texas Instruments TXN and STMicroelectronics STM.STMicroelectronics’ third-generation STPOWER SiC MOSFETs help meet the energy-saving efficiency requirements in EVs and are a chief competitor of onsemi in the EV market. STMicroelectronics’ solutions will help EV makers achieve faster charging and reduce EV weight. This helps STM win a significant market share in the industry.Texas Instruments is also seeing success in certain fast-growing automotive market segments. TXN is focused on infotainment, safety and ADAS, body electronics (including lighting), hybrid electric vehicle and powertrain segments of the automotive market. It also experiences significant traction from the EV megatrend.However, onesmi is reallocating its capacity to strategic and high-margin products to drive a favorable mix shift and eliminate the price-to-value discrepancies. Due to an expanding portfolio in high-margin products and long-term supply agreements for products in high demand, onsemi is expected to witness long-term revenue growth and win market share.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

These factors propel the demand for robust data storage solutions, bolstering the requirement for computer storage products. This is favoring the prospects of prominent industry players like Pure Storage PSTG, Teradata TDC and Super Micro Computer SMCI. Democratization of higher internal memory smartphones, faster Internet speed and 5G is likely to act as a tailwind for the industry participants. Rapid deployment of 5G networking is driving the proliferation of IoT, Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS) and Augmented Reality/Virtual Reality (AR/VR) devices. However, negative impacts stemming from the pandemic-triggered supply chain disruptions and component shortages are a concern in the near term.Industry DescriptionThe Zacks Computer-Storage Devices industry comprises companies that design, develop, manufacture and market various hard disk drives (HDDs) and solid-state drives (SSDs). These drives are utilized in PCs, laptops, mobiles, servers, network-attached storage (NAS) devices, video game consoles, digital video recorders and other consumer electronic devices. A few industry participants, including Pure Storage, provide software-defined all-flash solutions that are uniquely fast and cloud-capable for customers. Many industry players offer high-performance modular memory subsystems, mount and blade server systems, enterprise storage and data management software and hardware products and services. Some industry participants also provide purpose-built servers for storing and accessing data over a shared network or the Internet.4 Trends Shaping the Future of the Computer - Storage IndustryNew Normal Trends &amp; Rapid Implementation of 5G Opening New Business Avenues: Coronavirus-induced work-from-home and hybrid work models have triggered demand for data-intensive applications like video conferencing and cloud services. Effective storage is essential for harnessing data and is expected to raise demand for high-storage capable SSDs and internal memory in advanced smartphones. Accelerated deployment of 5G and rebound in the smartphone market are likely to propel the industry to newer heights. Extensive implementation of cloud computing solutions, increased Internet usage and rapidly-growing media and regulatory compliance, driven by coronavirus-led work-from-home setup, have led to data explosion for enterprises, which bodes well for the industry participants.Innovation in Cloud Storage Technologies to Drive Adoption: Extensive storage options from collocated hardware (such as hard disks and tape drives) to many cloud storage solutions has put the industry on a growth trajectory. The industry players are well poised for growth on the back of a rapid increase in the amount of data, the complexity of data formats and the need to scale resources at regular intervals. The companies rely on Artificial Intelligence for IT Operations (AIOps) and machine learning (ML) to manage and optimize storage solutions. To streamline data storage, companies are relying on virtualization technologies. As more data is amassed from IoT, the companies are turning to edge computing architecture to reduce latency and boost flexibility. Kubernetes storage is becoming increasingly popular as it facilitates greater agility and scalability. This has bolstered the deployment of high-capacity mass storage products, which is a positive for industry players.Relative Slowdown in IT Spending A Concern: Per a Gartner report, worldwide IT spending is expected to increase 3% in 2022 compared with 2021 levels and reach $4.5 trillion. Higher technology spending will drive the upside as enterprises continue to build sound technological infrastructure. However, the geopolitical disruptions, inflationary pressures and protracted pandemic-induced supply chain troubles remain major concerns. Also, consumer spending cuts on the purchase of PCs, tablets and printers are likely to bring down the IT spending growth to much less than the 10.2% spurt witnessed in 2021, added Gartner.Slowing Momentum in PC Shipments Might Hinder Growth Prospects: Worldwide PC shipments dropped 12.6% to 72 million units in the second quarter of 2022, according to the data compiled by Gartner. The latest Gartner report depicts the end of the massive spike in PC demand due to the pandemic-led work-from-home and online learning wave. In the second quarter, sales were affected by the Ukraine war, inflationary pressure and a decline in the sale of Chromebooks, added Gartner. A slowing PC market does not augur well for the industry participants.Story continuesZacks Industry Rank Indicates Bright ProspectsThe Zacks Computer Storage is housed within the broader Zacks Computer And Technology Sector.

The conduit carries gas from the ""pre-salt"" area off the coast of Rio state to Petrobras' largest refinery, Replan.""If we observe, the European countries with LNG storage are in a much better situation than those that don't have it,"" said NTS Chief Executive Erick Pettendorfer. ""So, we are developing a 'storage' for a sector that demands agility in dispatching and, at the same time, reliability.""Brazil lacks logistical solutions for unusual surges in domestic demand, he said, as happened during the country's 2021 drought, which triggered a big drop in hydropower output, forcing a sharp increase in the use of thermoelectric plants as well as higher energy prices.""This corridor will be an opportunity for the pre-salt players to place their product into the market"", he said.NTS' investment package also includes building a compression station, aiming to increase Replan's gas output.($1 = 5.1152 reais) (Reporting by Rafaella Barros; Writing by Peter Frontini; Editing by Stephen Coates)]"

The Russian leader also made a veiled threat to use nuclear weapons.The price cap measure is likely to be included in a new sanctions package that the European Commission, the EU's executive arm, will put forward, those people said, per the report.The oil market measure would align the EU with the Group of Seven — Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the UK and the US — which agreed to implement a price limit on Russian oil in early September. The G7 has not spoken on the details of its price cap.The EU has only weeks to hammer out the proposal for an oil price cap, as the measure would need to be in place when the bloc's embargo on seaborne Russian crude kicks in on December 5.Officials from member countries and the commission are set to meet this weekend for talks on the new sanctions, per Bloomberg.The aim of price caps is to crimp Moscow's revenues from energy exports, which are helping fund Russia's war on Ukraine.

It has been receiving Russian gas via the Turkstream pipeline which also delivers to Hungary via Serbia.Its LNG facility on the Revithoussa islet, 25 miles (40 kms)from Athens, can store 225,000 cubic metres of gas and regasify 1,400 cubic metres per hour.It is attracting growing interest from domestic and regional importers and has played a pivotal role in Greece's energy strategy and its efforts to boost security of supplies ahead of winter, Maria Rita Galli, the chief executive of the Greek gas grid operator DESFA told Reuters.""In the context of the energy crisis, Revithoussa is the import infrastructure, the import terminal that is enabling different sources of supply, different sources of LNG to reach the Greek gas market,"" Galli said.""Already this year, having maximised the use of Revithoussa, we have seen the import of gas from Russia dropping from 40% to less than 20%"".With increased demand for LNG across the world, cargoes arriving in Revithoussa have doubled year-on-year.GREEK EXPORTSBulgaria has also been importing LNG through the terminal after being cut off from Russian supplies following its refusal to pay in roubles.Speaking at an energy conference in Bucharest on Thursday, Greek Energy Minister Kostas Skrekas said his country had exported 2 billion cubic metres (bcm) of natural gas to Bulgaria and neighbouring countries so far this year, up from 0.7 bcm in 2021.Story continues""There is a growing interest. We have many interested parties looking at booking slots in the terminal,"" Galli said. ""In October, we will run the auction for 2023... and we do expect strong interest from national and international players.""Nearly two-thirds of 6.5 bcm of gas that Greece consumes annually is used for electricity generation.Like other European countries, it has grappled with soaring energy prices and has spent some 9 billion euros ($8.85 billion) since last year to subsidise power bills for households and businesses.To cope with the sky-rocketing cost and minimise the risk of gas shortages in the event Moscow cuts flows, the country has reopened some coal-fired plants and is ready to switch some gas-fired stations to diesel.In July, DESFA leased a vessel or a so-called floating storage unit (FSU), which is moored close to Revithoussa and can boost its storage capacity by an additional 145,000 cubic metres of gas, if needed.The vessel is expected to remain there until the end of 2023, while DESFA is looking into a permanent solution that would involve the purchase of a vessel that could be connected to Revithoussa with a pipeline, Galli said.""If we didn't have Revithoussa today, we would be like other central Balkan countries, totally reliant on imports of Russian gas,"" she said.

However, given the deep discounts offered by Russia since then, India, one of the world’s largest importers of crude oil, began snapping up nearly all the grades offered by Moscow.What is ESPO crude blend?ESPO crude oil is a light variant crude, produced by Russia’s Rosneft. It is shipped through the East Siberia-Pacific Ocean (ESPO) pipeline system and sold to the east Asian and the US’s west coast markets.Russia’s Urals grade, on the other hand, is mostly sold to European countries.In July, India imported 666,000 barrels per day (bpd) of Urals crude, according to Kpler data, much more than the 145,000 bpd of ESPO crude it bought.Overall, Russia’s ESPO exports have slipped from more than 800,000 bpd in July and August to 720,000 bpd in September, the Kpler data showed.India’s alternatives to Russian crudeOne reason for Indian refiners skipping ESPO crude might be rising inflation. They are turning to other oil-exporting regions like Africa and west Asia, industry sources said.Story continuesThe overall share of African crude oil has increased considerably this month. India alone has loaded 2.35 million tons of it so far this month, in comparison to 2 million tons of Russian crude, Refinitiv data showed.West Asian oil producers are lapping up this opportunity, too. For instance, Saudi Arabia slashed its selling prices in October.Besides, west Asian oil is better for India.While supplies from Russia take about a month to arrive, West Asian crude arrives in a week, according to Ehsan Ul Haq, an analyst with Refinitiv.Notably, though, some refineries of IndianOil Corp, Reliance Industries, Bharat Petroleum, and Nayara Energy have reduced intake this month, primarily due to planned maintenance shutdowns.]"

(Photo: Mojo)Mojo isn’t quite a direct competitor to the aforementioned gambling companies or emerging online sportsbooks like FanDuel (FLTR.L) and DraftKings (DKNG). Those companies largely make money from gross gaming revenue, a product of gamblers losing money to the house on wagers.Mojo operates more like a stock exchange akin to Robinhood (HOOD) or E*TRADE (MS). The company aims to generate revenue from “small commission transactions.”“We like to say it's where Robinhood meets DraftKings, but instead of you investing in Amazon or Google, you can invest in Joe Burrow or LeBron James, players that you can see every night, that you feel like you have some knowledge about,” Bharara said.Mojo makes the initial market and sets the price for players but from there, the market is all driven by statistics. Career-end projected statistics are the driver of price moves. For example, if Kansas City Chiefs quarterback Patrick Mahomes threw for more touchdowns than normal, his projections would shift higher, thus boosting the price.Story continuesJust like in the real stock market, though, bad news that forecasts potential poor performance down the line can sink shares. Last weekend, San Francisco 49ers quarterback Trey Lance left the field with a likely season-ending injury. His stock fell 15% at the “market open” on Monday.Mojo predicts future stats for NFL players. (Photo: Mojo)Still, Bharara noted, an ""important premise"" of Mojo's market is that when an investor owns stock in a player, they are ""basically guaranteed"" a payout based on that player's on-the-field statistics at the end of their career, no matter how early on in a career that might be.With career stats as a consistent market driver, Bharara and his team hope Mojo users will use the app like investors.There’s no cap to the amount of money that can be deposited onto the platform or time limit on how long a share can be held. An investor could go long on a player like seven-time Super Bowl champion Tom Brady from the start of his career and turn what would’ve been a $3 stock into a $180 value today.“For us, this idea that it's based on their career but also based on these objective stats, you know as an owner that there's this value you can rely on, and it anchors how prices move,” Bharara said.—Josh is a reporter and producer for Yahoo Finance.Read the latest financial and business news from Yahoo FinanceDownload the Yahoo Finance app for Apple or AndroidFollow Yahoo Finance on Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, Flipboard, LinkedIn, and YouTube]"

Its structure, with separately operated Express, Ground and Freight units, creates cost redundancies that are difficult to wring out.FedEx is also more exposed than competitors like United Parcel Service and Deutsche Post DHL Group to softening demand for air shipments out of Asia.The integration of its multi-billion dollar TNT Express acquisition in Europe has been so troubled that one analyst dubbed it an ""unmitigated disaster"". And, Subramaniam raised the temperature on simmering unrest in FedEx's U.S. Ground delivery contractor network by dubbing it ""much more of a perception issue than reality.""Last week, FedEx withdrew the financial forecast it issued just three months earlier - sparking frustration among investors who bet on a turnaround.Barclays analyst Brandon Oglenski bluntly summarized the investor and analyst exasperation during Thursday's call with management.""Your asset efficiency is literally half that of your nearest competitor, which is unionized, if I might add,"" he said, referring to UPS.Story continuesFedEx's action plan and comments did little to quell the discontent. The company's shares dropped as much as 3.9% to a more than two-year low of $148.50 in early Friday trade. They had shed 40% year to date as of Thursday's close, compared with a 22% drop in shares of UPS.""We remain skeptical on (FedEx's) scale and pace of cuts into a softening demand backdrop, coupled with its European Express service issues ... as well as ongoing FedEx Ground contractor disputes,"" BofA Global Research analyst Ken Hoexter said in a note.(Reporting by Kannaki Deka in Bengaluru and Lisa Baertlein in Los Angeles; Editing by Anil D'Silva, Kirsten Donovan)]"

(NYSE:FE) has announced that it will pay a dividend on the 1st of December, with investors receiving $0.39 per share. Based on this payment, the dividend yield on the company's stock will be 3.9%, which is an attractive boost to shareholder returns. Check out our latest analysis for FirstEnergy FirstEnergy's Dividend Is Well Covered By EarningsWe like to see robust dividend yields, but that doesn't matter if the payment isn't sustainable. The last payment was quite easily covered by earnings, but it made up 234% of cash flows. The company might be more focused on returning cash to shareholders, but paying out this much of its cash flow could expose the dividend to being cut in the future.Over the next year, EPS is forecast to expand by 19.1%. Assuming the dividend continues along recent trends, we think the payout ratio could be 58% by next year, which is in a pretty sustainable range.historic-dividendDividend VolatilityThe company's dividend history has been marked by instability, with at least one cut in the last 10 years. Since 2012, the dividend has gone from $2.20 total annually to $1.56. The dividend has shrunk at around 3.4% a year during that period. Generally, we don't like to see a dividend that has been declining over time as this can degrade shareholders' returns and indicate that the company may be running into problems.The Dividend Looks Likely To GrowGrowing earnings per share could be a mitigating factor when considering the past fluctuations in the dividend. We are encouraged to see that FirstEnergy has grown earnings per share at 67% per year over the past five years. The company's earnings per share has grown rapidly in recent years, and it has a good balance between reinvesting and paying dividends to shareholders, so we think that FirstEnergy could prove to be a strong dividend payer.In SummaryOverall, it's nice to see a consistent dividend payment, but we think that longer term, the current level of payment might be unsustainable. While FirstEnergy is earning enough to cover the payments, the cash flows are lacking. This company is not in the top tier of income providing stocks.Story continuesInvestors generally tend to favour companies with a consistent, stable dividend policy as opposed to those operating an irregular one. At the same time, there are other factors our readers should be conscious of before pouring capital into a stock. For example, we've identified 3 warning signs for FirstEnergy (1 is concerning!) that you should be aware of before investing. Looking for more high-yielding dividend ideas?

Now, he started by asking about the state of tech stocks.MARC BENIOFF: The market sells off on high interest rates. Now let's put that aside. And now let's talk about how we get all of our industries going post-pandemic. Post-pandemic, you know, well, during the pandemic, we actually were able to succeed over a lot of things we did pre-pandemic. Now post-pandemic, we have to bring people back. We have to sell them software. We have to explain our solutions. This is very technical.And, look, selling software is two things. One is you need a salesperson to come and talk to you and explain to you how it works. The second thing is you want to actually go talk to somebody and get validation. And events like this give you both.And I'm very excited about what's happening here in San Francisco. I think it's a huge shot in the arm for our local economy, $40 million. It's validation of where the tech market is, and also that Salesforce has this tremendous position in the hearts and minds of all of these customers.BRIAN SOZZI: I loved your keynote, Marc. And one thing that stood out to me amongst-- in that keynote, this term you mentioned, the Japanese term shoshin--MARC BENIOFF: Shoshin.BRIAN SOZZI: --and the need to have a beginner's mind. How are you applying that to Salesforce right now?MARC BENIOFF: Shoshin means have a beginner's mind, The Idea that in a beginner's mind, you have every possibility. But in the expert's mind, you have few possibilities. So that's how we operate Salesforce. At the beginning of every year, we sit down with a blank sheet of paper. We ignore all of this. We say that this never happened.Story continuesAnd we say, what do we want? What's important about it? How do we get it? What is preventing us from having it? How will we know that we have it? We answer these five critical questions. We define our core values like trust, customer success, innovation, equality, sustainability, and then we manifest it into our organization by operationalizing our values into our company.How are we going to get trust? What's preventing us from having trust? And how will you know that you have trust? And this process, shoshin process, we call it the V2MOM process. This has been instrumental and critical for us in running our business for the last 23 years.BRIAN SOZZI: Just being here for two days, it feels like there's another reinvention going on inside of Salesforce. Is that fair?MARC BENIOFF: Well, I think post-pandemic is very much a beginner's mind, that this is a new day. It's a new frontier. We really have to think about things new. I don't think there are a lot of things that are similar pre-pandemic. And I think you have to think about your business in a new way. You can still do things that you did before, and a great example is Dreamforce. Here we are.BRIAN SOZZI: 40,000 people.MARC BENIOFF: 40,000 people. But you also have to build technology that you did not have to build before. So you probably saw we have Slack now with audio, with video, with huddles because people are working in hybrid work environments. They need new tools that work well at home and in the office that bring each other together. Folks want to come together. That's just one example post-pandemic.BRIAN SOZZI: Why do we have offices anymore?MARC BENIOFF: Well, I think a lot of people do want to come back to the office, I think especially young people. Probably back in the day, you remember when you were young, when I was young, and it was great to be able to go in the environment together.BRIAN SOZZI: We're still young, Marc. We're still young.MARC BENIOFF: We're not as young as we were.BRIAN SOZZI: OK.MARC BENIOFF: And I'll tell you that when we were mentored, we all have stories of when we were mentored, when we were trained, when we were taken under somebody's wing and really educated and supported. And I think a lot of that happens in the office environment. And I want to make sure that our employees, you know, can participate in our culture, do volunteerism, support the environment, but also get mentored and also become part of the community.BRIAN SOZZI: So you're all-in on flexible work.MARC BENIOFF: I think that's extremely important.BRIAN SOZZI: Interesting. So talk to us about your Investor Day, big guidance numbers. I think it surprised a lot of folks on the Street. Most importantly, you reaffirmed that $50 billion revenue target, no recession. Is any economic slowdown baked into that number?MARC BENIOFF: What we can see with our business is that our revenue trajectory remains very strong, even with all of this unusual currency changes. $50 billion still looks like it is a high-quality target for us. In fiscal year '26, we added that with 25 basis points-- or sorry-- 25% margin.So that's an increase from 21% where we are today. We want to grow our revenues. We want to increase our margins. We want to increase our market share. We want to increase our levels of customer success. We want to bring people together. It's all related.BRIAN SOZZI: I miss you-- I just missed you at the Goldman Sachs conference a couple of weeks ago, but I caught your presentation. And you said maybe the market doesn't appreciate how focused you are on improving operating margins. Is it hard to just not go out there and buy another company, given where how valuations have just-- they've tanked the past couple of months?MARC BENIOFF: For us, I think that the market doesn't fully appreciate how committed we are to growth and margins. It's also why we have announced a new-- great new lead independent director yesterday, Robin Washington. It's why we announced a $10 billion stock buyback. It's why we announced a clear margin target at 25%.It's why we confirmed our $50 billion revenue number because I don't the mark-- don't think that the market and the investors fully appreciate it. But I have to tell you, we probably didn't have to do any of that because when they came here, that was the real inspiration, motivation, and excitement for all of these investors because they realized-- because they're talking to these folks who are here-- that this is going far better than we could have ever hoped.BRIAN SOZZI: How important is the big deal to you and Salesforce's future, doing that big transaction?MARC BENIOFF: Well, I think big deals are important. Small deals are important. All deals are important. I think-- we don't have a bias around size and quality of transaction. We like it when a customer buys our Sales Cloud or our Service Cloud or our Marketing Cloud or our Commerce Cloud or Slack or Tableau or MuleSoft, our platform.But we like it best of all when they buy all of it as one integrated suite called Customer 360. That's what we've really done. We enhanced it here at the show with Genie. Genie is the real-time extension--BRIAN SOZZI: I saw the bunny ears.MARC BENIOFF: The bunny.BRIAN SOZZI: You and Bret.MARC BENIOFF: The bunny. The bunny. I can tell you the story of the bunny if you want to hear about the bunny. But it was important for us to make sure that we are delivering high-quality levels of innovation like real-time, like artificial intelligence, like automation into our core platform and delivering the next generation for the customers. And you can see how they're reacting to it all very positively, I think far more positively than I expected it before the show started.BRIAN SOZZI: Last one here on a personal note. I only know you and Salesforce, Marc Benioff and Salesforce. I've grown up just following you and this company. You said in an interview last year, you are now moving into the fourth quadrant of your life. What does that quadrant look like for you?MARC BENIOFF: Well, I think you see that I have this incredible company here. I also have an amazing company with ""Time"" as well. I'm so grateful to be part of your industry. Even ""Time,"" yesterday, launched an amazing new--BRIAN SOZZI: Amazing.MARC BENIOFF: --company called CO2.com, which is the easy button for small and medium businesses to go net zero because, look, every company has to find a way to support the environment. Salesforce also launched its Net Zero Cloud. Salesforce also launched its Net Zero Marketplace. On my mind is the environment. There's three things that are very important to me for the fourth quadrant. Is there a fifth quadrant? I hope there is.BRIAN SOZZI: I hope there is. I think it gets over to 100.MARC BENIOFF: It doesn't imply there is when you say quadrants. But anyway, number one is-- number one is we all have to go net zero. And, look, net zero, this is a new term for me. When I went to college, I'd never heard about net zero, so learning that we're emitting too much, that we have to really evaluate our emissions, how to reduce our emissions, how to sequester our emissions.It's also why we came up with and launched this amazing program, global program called 1t.org, the trillion tree alliance to put a trillion trees on the planet, to sequester 200 gigatons of carbon. The tree is one of the great ways to take all of the CO2 out of the atmosphere, and it turns it into oxygen. We all know about photosynthesis from, like, the third grade.BRIAN SOZZI: Don't quiz me on it, please.MARC BENIOFF: It's more important than ever. Well, the CO2's in the atmosphere. The tree right here is converting it to O2, keeping the-- keeping the carbon and growing. So we need more trees, so thank you to the tree.BRIAN SOZZI: Yes.MARC BENIOFF: And also, it's an ecopreneur revolution. A lot of them are here. Entrepreneurs like me-- entrepreneurs like me who are focused on the environment and ecology are ecopreneurs. And this ecopreneur revolution, this is a third part of what's so important today because if we're going to get to 50% clean energy by 2030, we're going to have to achieve these things that we're talking about.BRIAN SOZZI: Lastly, you've given so much back to society, time, money, you name it, San Francisco. You signed the Giving Pledge. What do you think about Patagonia's founder's initiative? Is that the new benchmark? He's giving his company away, Marc.MARC BENIOFF: I think that is very inspiring and incredible what he has done. He's also led with his values through the entire lifetime of the company. And he is setting a high mark for what is possible for entrepreneurs. And I think entrepreneurs in the future will look to Patagonia as the way to do it.BRIAN SOZZI: Does that change how you think about what you do?MARC BENIOFF: It's honestly just very inspiring to me that there's many people out there who believe that business is the greatest platform for change and that they can use their businesses to improve the state of the world. When I went to college, Brian, the business of business was business. And today, the business of business is improving the state of the world. You look at the Patagonia founder. But I can give you many examples of many CEOs who realize they have incredible corporate resources, and they can use those corporate resources to improve the world.RACHELLE AKUFFO: Great stuff with our Brian Sozzi there with Salesforce co-founder and co-CEO Marc Benioff.]"

But when you're in charge of healthcare for a 70,000-person tech group, it's a much bigger undertaking.Brian Sozzi has been at Salesforce's Dreamforce conference in San Francisco. He spoke with the group's chief medical officer, Geeta Nayyar. She ascended to the role midway through the pandemic in September 2021. Brian asked her about that experience and what the company learned and what's moving-- what they're likely to see moving forward.GEETA NAYYAR: Look, the bottom line is we went through a lot during COVID. And the first thing you have to do is have a chief medical officer working with your executive team, making sure that healthcare is at the C-suite table, and staying on top of it.A big part of the pandemic was staying on top of the latest public health information, the latest pulse of what your employees were feeling, your customers were feeling, what was happening in that moment because as you know, it changed about every five minutes, if I remember.So when we had a plan, we'd have to back it up or change it. We had to be agile with the moment. And we used our technology to make sure we could pull off a safe event. Safety Cloud, Health Cloud, we used it, every technology we had. But we started and ended with health and safety first.BRIAN SOZZI: When you talk to employees, do they feel like the pandemic is over?GEETA NAYYAR: It really depends where you are in the world. It also depends where you are with your personal health and your family's health, to be very honest. And I think that's the case, whether we're in a pandemic or not. If you have someone in your household that's immunocompromised, I hear from those employees. The pandemic has an end, and the same fear exists.Story continuesBut for the most part, you see all the people walking around here. We are exiting the pandemic. Folks are really happy to be together. And they know that we've got their back, right? We believe in health and safety. You've heard it from Marc and Bret. We've expanded our benefits. We talk about mental health, telemedicine, not just ping pong tables. We're in it to win it. And we believe that health is well.BRIAN SOZZI: Don't take away [INAUDIBLE] ping pong tables.GEETA NAYYAR: Listen, I'm pretty good.BRIAN SOZZI: Oh, OK.GEETA NAYYAR: We can play.BRIAN SOZZI: OK, all right.GEETA NAYYAR: We can play and see where it goes.BRIAN SOZZI: I will take you up on that, Dr. G. So how do you think about the long-term effects of the pandemic? What do you hear about in terms of the biggest concerns within from employees?GEETA NAYYAR: Well, look, healthcare has been reprioritized. So number one, we are seeing customers saying, how do we, front and center, own employee health? We're in an economic downturn. Health is expensive. So how do you make sure that your employees are healthy, happy, productive? How do you scale your benefits to meet the moment, whether that's in mental health, whether that's in virtual care?And look, if you're looking to grow and innovate through the pandemic-- we sure are-- we're looking to disrupt the healthcare business. We're looking to scale the doctor-patient relationship. We think CRM is the way to do that. And so meeting consumers where they're at is the name of the game, but also meeting your employees where they're at.BRIAN SOZZI: Are you getting lots of reports about employee burnout?GEETA NAYYAR: So we hear a lot about this quiet quitting. So I don't really know how you survey that. But what I would say is that we, again, we continue to invest in our employees. We've onboarded and actually grown through the pandemic. I was onboarded virtually, so I'm meeting some people for the first time as well.We are seeing growth, and we are meeting our employees where they're at. And we're giving them tools like Slack and other benefits and programs to help them really check in with their health, check in with each other, and take the time if they need it, and really making sure that they are happy at work, not just present at work.BRIAN SOZZI: What type of perks or sweeteners do you put in from a healthcare perspective to keep people happy?GEETA NAYYAR: Well, look, first of all, I have to tell you, I was hired during the pandemic. So having a chief medical officer is going to go a long way as far as trust is concerned. We launched a program called the Be Well Together program during the pandemic. We bring in luminaries to talk about health and wellness. We brought in Megan Ranney, Dr. Ashish Jha.We brought in, really, the top most experts in the country and the world to talk directly to our employees, as well as made myself personally available in our What's Up, Doc series, where we would just have this kind of conversation. And people would say, well, this is my situation at home. Or I don't have a doctor. What should I do? How do I get one? Should I go to the ER? Should I go to the urgent care?So just real talk, real talk about healthcare, doc talk, as we call it, and really let our employees know that we were very serious from the top down and being transparent. We did all hands calls every week of the pandemic. And we would share from a leadership standpoint some of our own stories, some of our own challenges, and really just made it part of our culture to be at work and to be healthy and present.BRIAN SOZZI: What's your biggest challenge as you look forward to 2023?GEETA NAYYAR: Well, look, first of all, it's been meeting the moment. This is my first pandemic. I don't know about you.BRIAN SOZZI: Definitely my first.GEETA NAYYAR: I'm hoping it's the last.BRIAN SOZZI: I did not live back when those horses and carriages in, you know, 1885 or something, whenever that was.GEETA NAYYAR: So it's been all about meeting the moment. And it has been such a privilege to be at a company like Salesforce that I think really met the moment when it was needed and led through it, whether it was innovating products like Health Cloud, Safety Cloud, Vaccine Cloud.We met every innovation that happened in science, whether it was a vaccination, a test. We scaled it with our technology. We drank our own Kool-Aid. We used it ourselves as a company. And so meeting those demands in the moment has been amazing and awesome, but very dynamic and has kept me on my toes for sure.BRIAN SOZZI: Two questions in one-- one, how did you get this job? What was your career path? And then what is it like for you dealing with the pandemic-- so you have a family, but you're also dealing with the pandemic and all the concerns of these thousands of workers around the globe. What has this been like for you?GEETA NAYYAR: Well, it's been a challenge. First of all, everything comes back to trust. I've known Salesforce for a long time. I was a Salesforce customer, so I was recruited through that network as a trailblazer. And again, continue to be privileged--BRIAN SOZZI: They Slacked you with a job offer, right?GEETA NAYYAR: Something like that. I think I got a hoodie somewhere in the journey. And look, I'm a mom. There was a moment where my 10-year-old was not eligible for a vaccine. And the pandemic, to your question earlier, didn't end for us until our whole family was vaccinated, till we were sure it was safe to be out and about. I have a mom who's immunocompromised.So there's a lot of challenges that we faced as a family. And we just did our best to stay smart, to make measured risks. And we continue to do so even now and will continue to do so in the new year.BRIAN SOZZI: And how did you get this job? Just, was it an offer? You always wanted to do this, or?GEETA NAYYAR: Look, Salesforce is the company everybody wants to work at. And I felt that way as a customer. I saw that what they did for us as a provider. And I said, I want to be a part of that. And because of the pandemic, I saw Salesforce relevance in healthcare as a CRM accelerating. I mean, here we are post-pandemic. We're exiting the pandemic.Virtual care is now a tool, just like your stethoscope, just like your prescription pad. And so to be able to meet with our customers and advise them and truly enable that doctor-patient relationship at scale, at the customer's demand, look, you could be walking your dog and give me a call and be like, I want to check in on my blood pressure. Salesforce made that happen.BRIAN SOZZI: Don't check my blood pressure.]"

This makes the dividend yield about the same as the industry average at 1.0%. Check out our latest analysis for Microsoft Microsoft's Dividend Is Well Covered By EarningsWe like to see a healthy dividend yield, but that is only helpful to us if the payment can continue. However, Microsoft's earnings easily cover the dividend. This means that most of its earnings are being retained to grow the business.Over the next year, EPS is forecast to expand by 45.1%. If the dividend continues along recent trends, we estimate the payout ratio will be 20%, which is in the range that makes us comfortable with the sustainability of the dividend.historic-dividendMicrosoft Has A Solid Track RecordThe company has been paying a dividend for a long time, and it has been quite stable which gives us confidence in the future dividend potential. Since 2012, the annual payment back then was $0.80, compared to the most recent full-year payment of $2.48. This implies that the company grew its distributions at a yearly rate of about 12% over that duration. Rapidly growing dividends for a long time is a very valuable feature for an income stock.The Dividend Looks Likely To GrowSome investors will be chomping at the bit to buy some of the company's stock based on its dividend history. It's encouraging to see that Microsoft has been growing its earnings per share at 24% a year over the past five years. Earnings have been growing rapidly, and with a low payout ratio we think that the company could turn out to be a great dividend stock.Microsoft Looks Like A Great Dividend StockIn summary, it is always positive to see the dividend being increased, and we are particularly pleased with its overall sustainability. Earnings are easily covering distributions, and the company is generating plenty of cash. All of these factors considered, we think this has solid potential as a dividend stock.Story continuesCompanies possessing a stable dividend policy will likely enjoy greater investor interest than those suffering from a more inconsistent approach. Still, investors need to consider a host of other factors, apart from dividend payments, when analysing a company. For instance, we've picked out 1 warning sign for Microsoft that investors should take into consideration.

Software is ubiquitous and has become the focal point of technological innovation. Apart from running devices and applications, its usage has been extended to managing infrastructure. The industry is primarily gaining from the ongoing cloud transition.The role of software is constantly evolving. With the continuation of remote work setup and mainstream adoption of the hybrid/flexible work model, the demand for voice and video communication software and productivity software is expected to increase exponentially. These trends bode well for industry participants like Synopsys, Cadence Design Systems and DecisionPoint Systems.Industry DescriptionThe Zacks Computer Software industry includes companies that provide software applications related to cloud computing, electronic design automation (mostly for semiconductor and electronics industries), digital media and marketing, customer relationship management, on-premises and cloud-based database management, accounting and tax purposes, human capital management, cybersecurity and application performance monitoring and cloud-based enterprise communications platform among others.Some companies develop and market simulation software (like computer-aided design or CAD, 3D modeling, product lifecycle management or PLM, data orchestration and experience creation), which are used by engineers, designers and researchers across various industries like architecture, engineering and construction; product design and manufacturing; and digital media.3 Trends Shaping the Future of the Software IndustryHigher Spending on Software Aids Prospects: The industry’s prospects are bright, given higher spending by enterprises on software procurement. Continued investment in big data and analytics and the ongoing adoption of software as a service or SaaS open up significant opportunities for industry players. Cloud offers a flexible and cost-effective platform for developing and testing applications. The deployment time is also much shorter compared with legacy systems. SaaS companies are expected to register strong top-line growth on a higher percentage of recurring revenues, subscription gross margin and a lower churn rate.Story continuesCloud Computing Adoption Gaining Traction: The increasing need to secure the cloud platforms amid growing cyber-attacks and hacking incidents is driving demand for cyber security software. Enterprises are focused on rapid migration to cloud and DevOps technologies to achieve scalability and agility for software development and IT operations. This helps in delivering a flawless digital experience to clients. This trend has brought immense value to application and infrastructure performance monitoring. It is driving the demand for performance management monitoring tools that are scalable and suitable for cloud-based environments.Mainstream adoption of Hybrid/Remote Work to Drive Demand: The continuation of work-from-home and the mainstream adoption of the distributed workforce model is fueling demand for enterprise communication, workspace management and human capital management software solutions, among others. However, global macroeconomic weakness along with geopolitical instability in Europe due to the ongoing Russia-Ukraine war and lingering global supply chain troubles remain concerns. Increasing inflation could affect spending across small- and medium-sized businesses globally. The uncertainty in business visibility could dent the industry’s performance in the near term.Zacks Industry Rank Indicates Dim ProspectsThe Zacks Computer Software industry is housed within the broader Zacks Computer And Technology sector. It carries a Zacks Industry Rank #151, which places it in the bottom 40% of more than 251 Zacks industries.The group’s Zacks Industry Rank, which is the average of the Zacks Rank of all the member stocks, indicates bleak near-term prospects. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperform the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.Despite the gloomy industry outlook, a few stocks have the potential to outperform the market. But before we present the top industry picks, it is worth looking at the industry’s shareholder returns and current valuation first.Industry Outperforms Sector But Lags S&amp;P 500The Zacks Computer Software industry has outperformed the broader Zacks Computer and Technology sector but underperformed the S&amp;P 500 Index in the past year.The industry has lost 25.6% over this period compared with the S&amp;P 500 and the broader sector’ decline of 13.6% and 31.4%, respectively.Industry's Current ValuationOn the basis of forward 12-month P/E, a commonly-used multiple for valuing software companies, we see that the industry is currently trading at 23.95X compared with the S&amp;P 500’s 16.59X. It is also above the sector’s forward-12-month P/E of 19.89X.In the last five years, the industry has traded as high as 37.26X, as low as 22.61X and at the median of 27.80X.3 Software Stocks to Snap Up Right NowCadence Design Systems: Based in San Jose, CA, Cadence offers products and tools that help customers design electronic products. The company’s performance is being driven by strength across all segments owing to healthy demand for the company’s diversified product portfolio.Frequent product launches and synergies from acquisitions are expected to help the company sustain top-line growth. Cadence recently acquired OpenEye Scientific Software which is expected to improve revenues by approximately $40 million in fiscal 2023 as well as expand the company’s market reach in pharmaceutical and biotechnology market.The company’s Palladium and Protium platform is gaining traction among clients in the hyperscale, AI/ML and server customers.Increasing investments in emerging trends like Internet-of-things (IoT), augmented and virtual reality (AR/VR) and autonomous vehicle sub-systems present significant growth opportunities for this Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stock. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.In the past year, shares of Cadence have returned 2.9%. The consensus mark for the company’s 2022 earnings is pegged at $4.11 per share, up 5.7% in the past 60 days.DecisionPoint Systems: Laguna Hill, CA-based DecisionPoint is engaged in providing enterprise mobility and radio frequency identification technologies. The top-line performance is being driven by broad-based strength across several verticals amid global supply chain disruptions. Also, the company’s strong relationships with its OEMs and distribution partners are a tailwind.Synergies from recent acquisitions are likely to drive DecisionPoint’s performance. The company concluded two buyouts — Advanced Mobile Group and Boston Technologies — earlier in 2022. These acquisitions boost the company’s position in the lucrative transportation and direct store delivery verticals.The consensus mark for this Zacks Rank #1 company’s 2022 earnings is pegged at 24 cents per share, up 26.3% in the past 60 days. Shares have gained 50.2% in the past year.Synopsys: Mountain View, CA-based Synopsys is a vendor of electronic design automation software to the semiconductor and electronics industries.

However, the company’s opioid-related litigation expenses pose a threat.Shares of this Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) stock have gained 38.5% so far this year against the industry’s decline of 18.5%. The S&amp;P 500 Index has fallen 21.2% in the same time frame.The company — with a market capitalization of $53.3 billion — is a health care services and information technology company. Its earnings are anticipated to improve 10.1% over the next five years. The company beat earnings estimates in three of the trailing four quarters and missed once, the average surprise being 13%. The company’s earnings yield of 7.1% also compares favorably with the industry’s 4.7%.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchWhat’s Favoring It?McKesson continues to actively pursue deals, divestitures and acquisitions to drive growth. In April 2022, the company completed the divestiture of its retail and distribution businesses in the United Kingdom to Aurelius. During the fiscal fourth quarter of 2022, the company completed the sale of its Austrian business to Quadrifolia management and the sale of its remaining share of its German joint venture to Walgreens Boots Alliance. The company is currently progressing with the divestiture of its European business. These divestitures will allow the company to focus on its key growth market — the United States.In June, McKesson formed a joint venture with HCA Healthcare HCA to create a fully integrated oncology research organization. Per the deal, McKesson and HCA Healthcare will integrate their respective research units — US Oncology Research (USOR) and Sarah Cannon Research Institute (SCRI). The newly created entity with the combined capabilities of SCRI and USOR is expected to boost clinical research, ramp up the development of drugs, lead to better data and analytics capabilities, and pave the way for a wider portfolio of clinical trials. The deal between McKesson and HCA Healthcare is likely to be completed later this year.Story continuesMcKesson is a major player in the pharmaceutical and medical supplies distribution market. The Distribution Solutions segment caters to a wide range of customers and businesses and stands to benefit from increased generic utilization, inflation in generics, courtesy of several patent expirations in the next few years, and an aging population.During the fiscal first quarter of 2023, McKesson’s growth was led by its strong performance across all segments, except the International segment, which was marred by unfavorable currency movement. The divestiture of McKesson’s Austrian business also hurt growth.The company removed a major overhang during the fiscal first quarter by settling or signing a settlement agreement related to the opioid-related claims of all 50 states, as well as the District of Columbia and all eligible territories. These developments will close long-pending litigations that have been hurting the company’s goodwill and will also reduce legal expenses.McKesson’s agreements with the U.S. government for COVID-19 vaccine distribution, kitting and storage programs and COVID-19 tests are an added benefit.What’s Hurting the Stock?McKesson’s broad settlement of opioid-related claims of states and municipalities is likely to drive expenses for the company in the short term. The company recorded a pre-tax charge of $74 million during the fiscal first quarter of 2023 related to the settlement of an opioid-related claim with certain states and counties.McKesson Corporation PriceMcKesson Corporation PriceMcKesson Corporation price | McKesson Corporation QuoteEstimates TrendFor fiscal 2023, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues is pegged at $276.9 billion, indicating an improvement of 4.9% from the year-ago period’s reported figure. The same for adjusted earnings per share stands at $24.42, suggesting growth of 3.1% from the prior-year reported figure.Other Stocks to ConsiderA couple of other top-ranked stocks in the broader medical space are ShockWave Medical SWAV and AMN Healthcare Services AMN.AMN Healthcare surpassed earnings estimates in each of the trailing four quarters, the average surprise being 15.7%.

Goldman Sachs is dropping its requirements that New York City-based employees be vaccinated. This is according to a memo acquired by CNN. Joining us now to explain this further is Yahoo Finance's Anjalee Khemlani. Anjalee, what do we know about this policy, this update, and if it's time for companies to be doing this too?ANJALEE KHEMLANI: Well, I don't think it's time for companies to, meaning that we're getting into that time of year where respiratory viruses are coming back. And so it's really the time to be safe. So Goldman Sachs saying that as for its New York office starting November 1, vaccination policy goes away.This is something that the company has already implemented across the country. They had many of their offices already coming back without that vaccine mandate. So if this is how companies are going-- and it does seem like, you know, especially after the president's comments this past weekend, it seems like all the things are falling into place to kind of continue that trend.We also know, for example the MTA here in New York, right, removed the mask mandate on trains and subways and everything else. So it seems like, really, the country's doing this at a time where we're most at risk, is what public health experts are saying. So really is going to be an issue of waiting to see what the fallout is, if any.JULIE HYMAN: Yeah. Most at risk from a seasonal perspective, you're saying--ANJALEE KHEMLANI: Correct.JULIE HYMAN: --because we're heading into the time of the year when, if we are going to see a resurgence, it's going to be now.ANJALEE KHEMLANI: And there's a new variant on the horizon so.JULIE HYMAN: What's this one called? Does it have a name yet?ANJALEE KHEMLANI: BF.7, I think. Something-- something with B and 7's and--JULIE HYMAN: Whatever the case, it's no fun. All right. Thank you very much, Anjalee.]"

97,5b891abb-acb4-3496-85f0-3779ce751b1b,SLB,2022-09-23,7 Energy Stocks to Buy on the Dip or You’ll Be Kicking Yourself Later,InvestorPlace,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/7-energy-stocks-buy-dip-165329189.html,1663606409,STORY,"['DVN', 'MUSA', 'KMI', 'COP', 'SLB', 'VLO', 'CTRA']","[With the Federal Reserve set to implement aggressive interest rate hikes to combat inflation, the broader narrative for energy stocks to buy may not be that appealing to investors. However, it’s also clear that thanks to hotter-than-expected inflation readings, the central bank has its work cut out for it.Another factor to consider is the worsening geopolitical situation. Recently, Russia stirred the pot of its invasion of Ukraine by cutting off natural gas to Europe via the Nord Stream 1 pipeline. Effectively, a large portion of hydrocarbon supplies is now offline to the western world. Almost invariably, then, this catalyst will boost energy stocks to buy.As well, tensions tend to beget tensions. For instance, the former Soviet countries of Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan are fighting amid flaring historical and ethnic tensions.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsTherefore, with so much volatility, it’s wise for investors to focus on energy stocks to buy.COPConocoPhillips$113.16DVNDevon Energy$66.71CTRACoterra Energy$28.90SLBSchlumberger$38.77KMIKinder Morgan$17.89VLOValero Energy$103.99MUSAMurphy USA$279.17ConocoPhillips (COP)a sign in front of the Conoco Philips office buildingSource: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock.comA vertically integrated hydrocarbon company, ConocoPhillips (NYSE:COP) involves itself in every aspect of energy production. To be fair, though, it nowadays focuses largely on the upstream component, which handles on exploration and production. Given that geopolitics did a number on energy stocks to buy because of supply crunch implications, COP stock likewise suffered.Heading into the weekend, the stock closed the Friday, Sept. 16 session down 2%. For the week ending that Friday, COP slipped a little more than 1%. Of course, ConocoPhillips doesn’t represent the biggest discounted opportunity among energy stocks to buy. Nevertheless, because of its wide footprint and increasing global demand for hydrocarbon supplies, any dip may be a buy signal.Story continuesGurufocus labels COP as “fairly valued.” Arguably the company’s best feature from a financial perspective is its profitability metrics. One highlight is its operating margin, which stands at 33.13%. In comparison, the oil and gas industry median is 7.4%.Devon Energy (DVN)The logo for Devon Energy (DVN) is displayed on a sign outside an office.Source: Jeff Whyte / Shutterstock.comOn a similar fundamental note to ConocoPhillips above, Devon Energy (NYSE:DVN) benefits from the wild circumstances cynically bolstering energy stocks. Effectively, when Russia invaded Ukraine and subsequently responded to U.S. and European sanctions with its own commodity-based penalties, it weaponized hydrocarbons. Now cut off from a valuable energy source, Europe is scrambling for solutions.Unfortunately, a hydrocarbon bailout might not be arriving, per energy bosses. Nevertheless, European leaders must understand that this struggle will have years-long (perhaps decades-long) consequences. Therefore, the broader narrative supports independent oil and gas exploration and production firms like Devon Energy.Better yet, because the U.S. market finds more than enough distractions to keep it occupied, Wall Street may not be appreciating the long-term implications for DVN. Last Friday, DVN dropped nearly 4% while for the week it fell more than 5%. However, this is likely a temporary circumstance. Against a longer-term framework, DVN is one of the best energy stocks to buy.Coterra Energy (CTRA)Momentum stocks: Natural gas pipeline through green field with blue sky aboveSource: ShutterstockAt issue regarding the geopolitical flashpoint in eastern Europe is natural gas. Specifically, liquefied natural gas (LNG) is natural gas which is cooled at a liquefaction facility to approximately -260°F at atmospheric pressure. The end result facilitates an easier canvas for international transportation.Significantly, Coterra Energy (NYSE:CTRA) and sector competitor Devon Energy are both exploring new LNG opportunities, per Reuters. According to an article from May 2022, “Demand for U.S. LNG has boomed in recent months, driven by shortages in Europe and supply concerns after Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.” Indeed, such a statement turned prescient given Russia’s weaponization of hydrocarbon outflows.Despite the long-term positive implications for Coterra, CTRA took a massive hit on Friday, suffering a 6.5% loss. Over the trailing week, it lost 4.5% of market value. Not only that, in the trailing month, shares declined by nearly 5%. Nevertheless, the geopolitical narrative simply runs too hot to ignore Coterra. Therefore, CTRA is one of the energy stocks to buy on the dip.Schlumberger (SLB)slb stockSource: Valentin Martynov / Shutterstock.comIf you’re looking for a somewhat safer (in context of course) idea among energy stocks, Schlumberger (NYSE:SLB) fits the bill. An oilfield services company, Schlumberger plays a vital role on an infrastructural level. Put another way, an upstream (exploration and production) firm carries the risk of not finding anything useful. However, Schlumberger serves an existing demand base.As well, the company will likely see cynical geopolitical benefits that have bolstered other energy stocks over the long run. With Russia’s energy weaponization, multiple countries are desperately seeking reliable sources of hydrocarbons. Presumably, then, the oilfields will be busy, bolstering the narrative for SLB stock.However, Wall Street at the moment doesn’t see it that way. Last Friday, SLB declined by 3.2%. Over the week ending Sept. 16, SLB dropped over 4%. And in the trailing half-year period, SLB is in the red by 6%. Still, with energy prices likely to rise according to expert forecasts, Schlumberger represents one of the energy stocks to buy on the dip.Kinder Morgan (KMI)Kinder Morgan logo on a sign outside the company headquarters in Houston.Source: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock.comOne of the largest energy infrastructure companies in North America, Kinder Morgan (NYSE:KMI) represents a powerhouse in the midstream segment. Essentially, midstream operators are the stagehands of the hydrocarbon industry. Dealing with areas such as storage and transportation, they’re background players, quietly and diligently providing the connection between upstream and downstream companies.In many cases, you don’t hear about midstream players until something bad happens. However, as an investor, you should pay close attention, particularly to KMI. Gurufocus considers Kinder Morgan “modestly undervalued.” Featuring a relatively balanced financial profile, the company’s greatest strength lies in its profitability metrics. A standout is its operating margin of 21.6%, much higher than the aforementioned sector median of 7.4%.Still, Wall Street is giving you a great deal on KMI. On Friday, the stock declined 2.6%. Over the trailing week, it slipped 4.5%. Over the trailing month, shares are down 4% and on a trailing half-year basis, shares fell 1%. Consider grabbing this discount before it and other energy stocks jump higher.Valero Energy (VLO)A daytime picture of a Valero (VLO) gas station located in San Francisco bay and clear blue sky in the background.Source: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.comAlthough Valero Energy (NYSE:VLO) involves itself in several components of the hydrocarbon business, it features a viable downstream business. Technically, when analysts talk about downstream hydrocarbon specialists, they refer to “processes that occur after the production phase to the point of sale.” In simple terms, if it goes into your fuel tank, it’s downstream.What I appreciate about energy stocks to buy tethered to the downstream segment is price inelasticity. Of course, fluctuating prices impact consumer behaviors. Specifically, though, baseline demand is inelastic. At a certain point, consumers must buy fuel to get to where they’re going, irrespective of the cost.However, as logical as that might sound, Wall Street doesn’t believe in the thesis, apparently. Over the trailing week ended Sept. 16, VLO dropped about 10% of market value. In the trailing month, shares dipped more than 11%. Still, I expect this trajectory to turn around because of the inelasticity principle mentioned earlier.Murphy USA (MUSA)Murphy USA gas station and convenience store located on an out parcel of a Walmart SupercenterSource: Lawrence Glass / Shutterstock.comAnother downstream specialist, Murphy USA (NYSE:MUSA) represents one of the energy stocks that rarely went on discount this year. Now that it’s doing so, investors ought to pay attention to MUSA stock.On Friday, Murphy USA lost about 1.8% of market value. In the week ended Sept. 16, MUSA dropped more than 5%. Against the trailing month, the red ink comes out to a magnitude of 6.1%. However, on a wider scale, we’re talking about a security that gained a hair over 40% for the year. It’s certainly not a name to ignore.One major factor that separates Murphy USA from other downstream energy stocks is economics. The company represents one of the largest independent retailers of gasoline products and convenience store merchandise. More importantly, it strategically locates its stations near discount-oriented big-box retailers.That should go a long way in helping both budget-sensitive customers as well as folks who have money but also don’t mind a discount.On the date of publication, Josh Enomoto did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.A former senior business analyst for Sony Electronics, Josh Enomoto has helped broker major contracts with Fortune Global 500 companies.

The market chatter going into Wednesday’s monetary policy meeting was that there was a high likelihood of a relief rally in tech if the central bank, as expected, raised its benchmark rate by 75 basis points. Turns out it wasn’t that straightforward. The Nasdaq 100 slumped to early July lows, pretty much erasing most of the summer rally, after a more hawkish tone than hoped for from the Fed.So why not avoid tech until the dust settles? That just isn’t an option for most institutional investors, given that the industry is by far the largest in the S&amp;P 500 Index, at almost 27% of the benchmark. If tech stocks turn around and you miss out on the rally, it can be career-ending.Stockpickers thus are gravitating towards “quality” companies with durable businesses or stock charts. Apple Inc. is down just 13% this year. T-Mobile US Inc., cybersecurity company Palo Alto Networks Inc. and chipmaker Texas Instrument Inc. are a few of the others that also have managed to beat most of their tech peers.“Look for businesses with high market share, a good moat, and low substitution risk,” said Brian Battle, director of trading at Performance Trust Capital Partners. “Microsoft makes stuff that people pay for. Apple sells billions in consumer goods, and it is hard to replace those.”Story continuesCompanies that don’t have those attributes are getting slammed in the stock market. Take Meta Platforms Inc., the Facebook owner dependent on ads. It’s lost 58% of its value this year. It’s a similar picture with Snapchat owner Snap Inc. and streaming-video company Netflix Inc.As long as real yields in the bond market keep going up, tech stocks probably haven’t bottomed, arguing against buying into the Nasdaq 100. While the index’s earnings multiple has come down a lot, it’s falling from very inflated levels. But stockpickers are finding plenty to buy in tech.“So it has gotten cheaper, but it isn’t cheap,” said Alec Young, chief investment strategist at Mapsignals, a quantitative research firm. “Until it feels like the Fed is able to take a pause on tightening, tech isn’t likely to be a leadership sector.”Tech Chart of the DayTop Tech StoriesAmazon.com Inc. lost a bid to exclude top executives including billionaire founder Jeff Bezos and Chief Executive Officer Andy Jassy from having to testify in a Federal Trade Commission probe.Sometime next year, Tim Cook will appear before the Apple Inc. faithful and unveil the company’s next major computing platform, a headset that mixes virtual reality and augmented reality.Meta Platforms Inc. was sued for allegedly building a secret work-around to safeguards that Apple Inc. launched last year to protect iPhone users from having their internet activity tracked.

But more than that, you probably want to see it rise more than the market average. But Amgen Inc. (NASDAQ:AMGN) has fallen short of that second goal, with a share price rise of 23% over five years, which is below the market return. Over the last twelve months the stock price has risen a very respectable 5.9%.With that in mind, it's worth seeing if the company's underlying fundamentals have been the driver of long term performance, or if there are some discrepancies. See our latest analysis for Amgen There is no denying that markets are sometimes efficient, but prices do not always reflect underlying business performance. By comparing earnings per share (EPS) and share price changes over time, we can get a feel for how investor attitudes to a company have morphed over time.Over half a decade, Amgen managed to grow its earnings per share at 2.1% a year. This EPS growth is slower than the share price growth of 4% per year, over the same period. This suggests that market participants hold the company in higher regard, these days. And that's hardly shocking given the track record of growth.You can see how EPS has changed over time in the image below (click on the chart to see the exact values).earnings-per-share-growthWe know that Amgen has improved its bottom line lately, but is it going to grow revenue? You could check out this free report showing analyst revenue forecasts.What About Dividends?As well as measuring the share price return, investors should also consider the total shareholder return (TSR). Whereas the share price return only reflects the change in the share price, the TSR includes the value of dividends (assuming they were reinvested) and the benefit of any discounted capital raising or spin-off. It's fair to say that the TSR gives a more complete picture for stocks that pay a dividend. We note that for Amgen the TSR over the last 5 years was 42%, which is better than the share price return mentioned above. This is largely a result of its dividend payments!Story continuesA Different PerspectiveIt's good to see that Amgen has rewarded shareholders with a total shareholder return of 9.4% in the last twelve months. And that does include the dividend. That's better than the annualised return of 7% over half a decade, implying that the company is doing better recently. Someone with an optimistic perspective could view the recent improvement in TSR as indicating that the business itself is getting better with time. I find it very interesting to look at share price over the long term as a proxy for business performance. But to truly gain insight, we need to consider other information, too.

112,fd05651d-6705-36df-91f0-f323ae09b2cf,AMGN,2022-09-23,AstraZeneca's (AZN) Asthma Drug Tezepelumab Gets Nod in Europe,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/astrazenecas-azn-asthma-drug-tezepelumab-153003069.html,1663860603,STORY,"['AZN.L', 'AZN', 'AMGN', 'GSK']","[AstraZeneca AZN announced that the European Commission has granted approval to its monoclonal antibody, Tezspire (tezepelumab) for the treatment of severe asthma.Tezspire can now be prescribed in Europe as an add-on maintenance treatment for patients aged 12 years and older with severe asthma who are inadequately controlled with high-dose inhaled corticosteroids plus another medicinal product. Tezspire was approved in the United States for a similar indication in December 2021. AstraZeneca markets Tezspire in partnership with Amgen AMGN.The approval in Europe was expected as in July, The Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use of the European Medicines Agency had given a positive opinion, recommending the marketing authorization of Tezspire.So far this year, AstraZeneca’s shares have declined 3.1% compared with a decrease of 5.1% for the industry.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchThe approval of Tezspire was based on data from the PATHFINDER clinical program and included the pivotal phase III NAVIGATOR study. Data from these studies showed that treatment with Tezspire led to superior results across every primary and key secondary endpoint in patients with severe asthma, compared to placebo, when added to standard therapy.Patients with severe asthma experience frequent exacerbations and an increased risk of hospitalization. In the studies, which included a broad population of severe asthma patients, Tezspire consistently and significantly reduced exacerbations. It is the only biologic medicine approved by the FDA as well as EC to treat severe asthma with no phenotype limitation and irrespective of biomarker levels.AstraZeneca and Amgen are jointly developing Tezspire. While AstraZeneca leads the development of the drug, Amgen leads manufacturing. Amgen and AstraZeneca will jointly commercialize Tezspire in North America. While Amgen will record product sales in the United States, AstraZeneca will record its share of profits in the United States as collaboration revenues. AstraZeneca will record product sales outside the United States while Amgen will record profit share.Story continuesAstraZeneca and Amgen are also evaluating Tezspire for other indications like chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps, chronic spontaneous urticaria and eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE).Competitive pressure in the overall asthma market has intensified over the years. Tezspire is likely to face stiff competition from Glaxo’s GSK Nucala, and Regeneron REGN and Sanofi’s blockbuster medicine, Dupixent, which are approved for treating patients with severe asthma and some other indications as well.Other than severe eosinophilic asthma, Glaxo’s Nucala is approved for hypereosinophilic syndrome, eosinophilic granulomatosis and polyangiitis and chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps.Nucala is a key top-line driver for Glaxo. It is being studied in late-stage studies for COPD.Sanofi and Regeneron’s Dupixent is now approved in the United States and the EU for three type II inflammatory diseases, namely severe chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyposis, severe asthma and moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis. It was recently approved for the fourth indication, EoE in the United States.With outside U.S. revenues accelerating and multiple approvals for new indications expected in the near future, Dupixent’s sales are expected to be higher. Sanofi and Regeneron’s Dupixent is in late-stage development for bullous pemphigoid, chronic spontaneous urticaria, and COPD. It is also under priority review in the United States for prurigo nodularis.AstraZeneca currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

Shares have lost about 11.3% in that time frame, underperforming the S&amp;P 500.Will the recent negative trend continue leading up to its next earnings release, or is Macy's due for a breakout? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at the most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important catalysts.Macy's Q2 Earnings Top, Comp Sales Decline, View CutMacy’s, Inc. came up with second-quarter fiscal 2022 results, wherein both the top and bottom lines beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate but declined year over year. Comparable sales also fell on an owned basis and an owned-plus-licensed basis. Inflationary headwinds, changing consumer behavior and inventory gluts hurt the company’s performance. Following the results, Macy’s trimmed the full-year sales and earnings view due to markdowns and promotions needed to offload excess inventories.Macro-economic pressures, waning consumer confidence and a pullback in spending activity have hit consumer discretionary stocks, and Macy’s is not immune to the same. The company’s inventories were higher 7% at the end of the quarter. Management informed that the inventory remained elevated in certain categories due to lower sales since Father's Day.Macy’s is resorting to markdowns in seasonal goods, private brand merchandise and pandemic-related categories, such as active, casual sportswear, sleepwear and soft home. On the flip side, the company intends to focus on in-demand categories and is targeting the optimum inventory level by the end of the fiscal year.The company believes that the Polaris Strategy positions it well to navigate through the dynamic retail landscape. Management highlighted that consumers continued to shop Macy's. Also, both Bloomingdale’s and Bluemercury brands outperformed in the said quarter.Story continuesSales &amp; Earnings PictureMacy’s reported adjusted earnings of $1.00 per share, which surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 85 cents and our estimate of 87 cents. However, the bottom line declined sharply from the adjusted earnings of $1.29 reported in the year-ago period.Net sales of $5,600 million came ahead of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $5,481 million and our estimate of $5,527 million. However, the top line decreased 0.8% on a year-over-year basis. Comparable sales fell 1.5% on an owned basis and 1.6% on an owned-plus-licensed basis year over year. The metric fared better than our estimate of down 2.1% on an owned basis and down 2.5% on an owned-plus-licensed basis.The company’s digital sales dropped 5% from the prior-year quarter and conversion was down 3%. The metric surged 37% from second-quarter fiscal 2019 level, while conversion was up 14%. Digital penetration was 30% of net sales in the quarter under review. This reflected a 2-percentage point contraction from the prior-year period’s level but an 8-percentage point improvement over the second quarter of fiscal 2019. Approximately 64% of digital demand sales came from mobile devices. Stores fulfilled 23% of digital sales in the quarter. The second-half digital penetration is anticipated at about 35.5% considering the trends seen at the end of the second quarter.Digital penetration was 30%, 32% and 19%, respectively, at Macy’s, Bloomingdale’s and Bluemercury brands during the quarter under discussion.Net credit card revenues amounted to $204 million, up $7 million from the year-ago period. The metric represented 3.6% of sales, up 10 basis points year over year.Brand-Wise DetailsComparable sales across Macy’s declined 2.9% on an owned basis and 2.8% on an owned-plus-licensed basis. On a trailing 12-month basis, 43.9 million active customers shopped the Macy’s brand, up 7% year over year. The company continued to witness a stellar performance in occasion-based categories, including career and tailored sportswear, fragrances, shoes, dresses and luggage.At the Bloomingdale’s brand, comparable sales increased 8.8% on an owned basis and 5.8% on an owned-plus-licensed basis. Management informed that roughly four million active customers shopped the Bloomingdale’s brand on a trailing 12-month basis, reflecting an increase of 14% from the year-ago period. Under the Bloomingdale’s banner, growth was driven by the robust performance in women’s, men’s and kid’s contemporary and dressy apparel as well as luggage.Comparable sales at the Bluemercury brand were up 7.6% on an owned and owned-plus-licensed basis driven by continued strength in color and skincare. About 700,000 active customers shopped the Bluemercury brand on a trailing 12-month basis, representing a year-over-year increase of 9%.The company plans to open five to six off mall locations in fiscal 2022, a mix of Market by Macy’s, Freestanding Backstage, Bloomie’s and Bloomingdale’s the Outlet.MarginsThe gross margin came in at 38.9%, down from 40.6% in the prior-year quarter. The year-over-year decline was driven by a 160-basis point contraction in the merchandise margin due to an increase in permanent markdowns within the Macy’s brand, stemming from pandemic-related categories, seasonal goods and private brand merchandise. Delivery expenses, as a percentage of net sales, climbed 10 basis points to 4.5% due to a rise in fuel costs and an increase in the percentage of digital sales fulfilled by the vendor direct channel.SG&amp;A expenses increased 4.4% year over year to $1,981 million. As a percentage of net sales, SG&amp;A expenses increased 180 basis points year over year to 35.4%.Macy’s reported adjusted EBITDA of $616 million, down significantly from adjusted EBITDA of $836 million in the year-ago quarter. We note that the adjusted EBITDA margin shriveled 380 basis points to 11% from the prior-year period.Other Financial AspectsMacy’s ended the quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $300 million, long-term debt of $2,995 million and shareholders' equity of $3,531 million.Year to date, the company repurchased shares worth $600 million and paid $87 million in dividends. The company has $1.4 billion remaining under its share repurchase authorization.During the 26-week period ended Jul 30, 2022, Macy’s generated cash flow from operating activities of $303 million and incurred capital expenditures of $582 million. It generated negative free cash flow of $206 million. Management expects capital expenditures of approximately $1 billion for fiscal 2022.Sneak Peek Into GuidanceMacy’s now envisions fiscal 2022 net sales in the bracket of $24,340 million-$24,580 million, down from its prior view of $24,460 million to $24,700 million. It projected comparable owned-plus-licensed sales to be flat to up 1%. Management forecast credit card revenues, net, to be roughly 3.3% of net sales, up from the previous expectation of 3.1% of net sales.Macy’s foresees the fiscal 2022 gross margin rate to contract approximately 150 basis points from the last year due to the additional markdowns. It expects the SG&amp;A expense rate to be up 120 basis points from the prior year.It now estimates the fiscal 2022 adjusted EBITDA margin to be 10.5% compared with 13.6% in fiscal 2021. The company earlier projected the adjusted EBITDA margin between 11.2% and 11.7%.Macy’s now envisions fiscal 2022 adjusted earnings between $4.00 and $4.20 per share, down from the prior projection of $4.53 to $4.95 per share. The current view indicates a decline from the adjusted earnings of $5.31 per share reported in fiscal 2021.For the third quarter of fiscal 2022, management anticipates net sales between $5,160 million and $5,230 million. This indicates a decline from net sales of $5,440 million reported in the year-ago period. It guided third-quarter adjusted earnings to be 15 to 21 cents a share. This suggests a decrease from the $1.23 reported in the third quarter of fiscal 2021. Macy’s expects the gross margin rate to shrivel no more than 350 basis points from the prior-year period, reflecting the impacts of markdowns, a promotional environment and higher fuel costs.How Have Estimates Been Moving Since Then?In the past month, investors have witnessed a downward trend in estimates review.The consensus estimate has shifted -61.45% due to these changes.VGM ScoresAt this time, Macy's has a great Growth Score of A, though it is lagging a lot on the Momentum Score front with an F. However, the stock was allocated a grade of A on the value side, putting it in the top quintile for this investment strategy.Overall, the stock has an aggregate VGM Score of A. If you aren't focused on one strategy, this score is the one you should be interested in.OutlookEstimates have been broadly trending downward for the stock, and the magnitude of these revisions indicates a downward shift. Notably, Macy's has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). We expect an in-line return from the stock in the next few months.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Moreover, if you read on, you’ll find that many of the top defense companies also have a growing private sector business.The combination of both sectors and clients with deep pockets makes defense stocks interesting long-term investments.LMTLockheed Martin$421.53RTXRaytheon Technologies$88.04NOCNorthrop Grumman$491.41Lockheed Martin (LMT)A Lockheed Martin (LMT) C-130J Super Hercules of the United States Air Force performing at Aero India 2017.Source: Joe Ravi / Shutterstock.comLockheed Martin (NYSE:LMT) generates the lion’s share of its sales from government contracts.In the past couple of years, it hasn’t been able to generate attractive growth numbers. However, it seems to be reaching an inflection point with robust margins and higher deliveries over the next three to four years.Furthermore, LMT’s management is looking to invest heavily in the business and work on limiting costs to accentuate the results of the inflection point. The results are already showing in its top-notch margin profile, which remains firmly in the green across multiple metrics.LMT is one of its sector’s most attractive dividend stocks. It boasts over nine years of consecutive payout growth, with almost a 2.7% yield. Hence, its stellar business model, steady financials, and penchant for rewarding shareholders remain an excellent long-term bet in the sector.Story continuesRaytheon Technologies (RTX)A German army mobile Raytheon (RTX) MIM-104 Patriot surface-to-air missile (SAM) system on display during the Laage airbase open house.Source: VanderWolf Images / Shutterstock.comRaytheon Technologies (NYSE:RTX) is one of the top defense contractors worldwide. One of its key competitive advantages over its peers is its healthy exposure to the commercial aerospace sector.It boasts a fortress of a balance sheet that continues to benefit from greater operational efficiencies and rebounding commercial aviation. Moreover, its outlook remains incredible over the long-term, “supported by the return to travel and growing global defense budgets.”As we advance, it looks to generate 6% to 7% annualized sales growth and over $10 billion in free cash flows. It implies a spectacular FCF yield of 7.7%, unlocking significantly higher shareholder distribution. That seems like an achievable target given the strong results its been generating over the past several quarters.In addition to its stellar dividend profile, it continues to reward investors through consistent buybacks. It repurchased shares worth over $1 billion in the second quarter alone. Its goal for the year is to repurchase $2.5 billion worth of shares.Northrop Grumman (NOC)Northrop Grumman (NOC) logo on a corporate buildingSource: Kristi Blokhin / Shutterstock.comNorthrop Grumman (NYSE:NOC) operates a highly diversified defense operation.It has exposure to some of the fastest-growing segments, such as space and aeronautics. Its defense systems business constitutes the least amount of company sales, but that number has grown remarkably.The division is likely to be strengthened by the release of its B-21 Raider this year, contributing a massive $1.5 billion in revenues. Also, you have the ground-based strategic deterrent that should factor in growth in 2024.Northrop essentially operates an incredible business model having its fingers in multiple profitable verticals in the defense niche. It’s been one of the most attractive dividend stocks in the sector, boasting 16 consecutive years of payout growth.Northrop’s earnings report may seem unappealing, but that’s because defense-related contracts take time to materialize and involve plenty of delivery milestones before revenues can be recorded.Its backlog has increased by 6% to a whopping $80 billion during the second quarter, a testament to its incredible long-term outlook.On the date of publication, Muslim Farooque did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing GuidelinesMuslim Farooque is a keen investor and an optimist at heart.

The Russian leader also made a veiled threat to use nuclear weapons.The price cap measure is likely to be included in a new sanctions package that the European Commission, the EU's executive arm, will put forward, those people said, per the report.The oil market measure would align the EU with the Group of Seven — Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the UK and the US — which agreed to implement a price limit on Russian oil in early September. The G7 has not spoken on the details of its price cap.The EU has only weeks to hammer out the proposal for an oil price cap, as the measure would need to be in place when the bloc's embargo on seaborne Russian crude kicks in on December 5.Officials from member countries and the commission are set to meet this weekend for talks on the new sanctions, per Bloomberg.The aim of price caps is to crimp Moscow's revenues from energy exports, which are helping fund Russia's war on Ukraine. The US is pushing for a limit that takes historical prices into consideration — about $60 a barrel.But some analysts have warned such measures could backfire, if Moscow responds by cutting off its crude supply to the market. Bank of America analysts have forecast it could push Brent crude futures above $130 a barrel.Russian Urals oil futures rose 1.5% to trade at $72.17 a barrel Friday.

However, given the deep discounts offered by Russia since then, India, one of the world’s largest importers of crude oil, began snapping up nearly all the grades offered by Moscow.What is ESPO crude blend?ESPO crude oil is a light variant crude, produced by Russia’s Rosneft. It is shipped through the East Siberia-Pacific Ocean (ESPO) pipeline system and sold to the east Asian and the US’s west coast markets.Russia’s Urals grade, on the other hand, is mostly sold to European countries.In July, India imported 666,000 barrels per day (bpd) of Urals crude, according to Kpler data, much more than the 145,000 bpd of ESPO crude it bought.Overall, Russia’s ESPO exports have slipped from more than 800,000 bpd in July and August to 720,000 bpd in September, the Kpler data showed.India’s alternatives to Russian crudeOne reason for Indian refiners skipping ESPO crude might be rising inflation. They are turning to other oil-exporting regions like Africa and west Asia, industry sources said.Story continuesThe overall share of African crude oil has increased considerably this month.

Both were in technically oversold territory, with WTI on track for its lowest settlement since Jan. 10 and Brent for its lowest since Jan. 14.U.S. gasoline and diesel futures were also down more than 5%.The U.S. Federal Reserve raised interest rates by a hefty 75 basis points on Wednesday.

124,18857c89-e88c-36eb-9865-7b9722fbcab5,NOV,2022-09-23,Oil Heads for 4th Week of Losses as Fed Jitters Offset Tightening Supply,Investing.com,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/oil-heads-4th-week-losses-210903151.html,1663880943,STORY,"['SCO', 'UCO', 'CL=F']","[By Ambar WarrickInvesting.com-- Oil prices rose slightly on Friday, but were set to lose for a fourth straight week as concerns over headwinds from rising interest rates outweighed expectations that crude supply will tighten due to the Russia-Ukraine conflict.Concerns over rising interest rates across the globe, particularly after a hike by the Federal Reserve this week, dented crude prices as traders feared tighter liquidity conditions and more headwinds to economic growth.Still, oil prices trimmed some of their weekly losses after Russia appeared set to escalate its invasion of Ukraine, a move that could potentially disrupt oil shipments and tighten global supply this year. Major Asian importers China and India buy heavy amounts of crude from Moscow. Crude prices also took some relief from a smaller-than-expected rate hike by the Bank of England.London-traded Brent oil futures rose 0.2% to $90.50 a barrel, while U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude futures rose 0.1% to $83.61 a barrel by 20:37 ET (00:37 GMT). Both contracts were set to lose 0.9% and 1.8%, respectively, this week.A more hawkish-than-expected message from the Fed on U.S. monetary policy was the biggest weight on oil prices this week, as the central bank warned that it was prepared for risks to economic growth and the labor market in its fight against inflation. Several other European and Asian central banks also tightened monetary policy this week.Tighter monetary policy weighs on overall liquidity in markets, dissuading crude buyers. High interest rates also dent economic activity, weighing on demand for crude in industrial activities.Consumers are also facing the double whammy of high inflation and high interest rates, dampening their ability to purchase gasoline. Additionally, the U.S. government also increased crude supply by drawing from its Strategic Petroleum Reserve, which dented prices in recent weeks.But crude prices rose on Thursday after Russian President Vladimir Putin partially mobilized troops for a renewed push into Ukraine. An escalation in the conflict is likely to tighten supply again, as it had earlier this year.Story continuesThe European Union also ramped up plans for a price cap on Russian oil, while Nigeria’s oil Minister Timipre Marlin Sylva, speaking on behalf of OPEC+, threatened to cut production if oil prices fell further.Traders are now caught between potential demand headwinds from rising interest rates and a possible tightening in supply.Related ArticlesOil Heads for 4th Week of Losses as Fed Jitters Offset Tightening SupplyGold Steadies Despite Rate Hike Headwinds, set for Flat WeekChina May Find It Hard to Cool Lithiumâs Rally This Time Around]"

The relatively mild 2% Wednesday loss obscures a wild ride as bitcoin traded in a $1,600 range (8% of the current price) over approximately six hours. As markets digested the totality of Tuesday’s interest rate increase, initial optimism related to the hike only being 75 basis points yielded to the reality of the Federal Reserve’s increasingly hawkish long-term outlook.Ether (ETH) rose 6.9%, trading in concert with bitcoin and surpassing the $1,300 mark. Despite the differences between the two assets, ether is still highly correlated to bitcoin. Following the increase in interest rates, ETH prices ranged from a high of $1,407 to a low of 1,218, a $189 swing that equates to 14% of current ETH prices.The CoinDesk Market Index (CMI), a broad-based market index that measures performance across a basket of cryptocurrencies, rose 3%.Economic Calendar: The U.K.’s central bank took the interest rate stage Thursday, raising its key interest rate by 50 basis points. This marks its seventh consecutive rate hike and pushed U.K. borrowing costs to a 14-year high.Countries worldwide are in a phase of aggressive monetary tightening policy; the central banks of Canada, Switzerland and the eurozone have recently taken similar actions.The broader concern is the extent to which restrictive monetary policy suppresses economic output, which is likely to have a negative impact on the prices of risk assets like bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies.U.S. Equities: Traditional equities declined, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA), tech-heavy Nasdaq composite and S&amp;P 500 down 0.4%, 1.4% and 0.8%, respectively.Commodities: WTI crude oil rose 0.8% while natural gas fell 7%.

Measuring the RSI (Relative Strength Index) between the negative candle on Sept. 13 to the negative candle on Sept. 21 implies a bearish confirmation, highlighted by increased volume into the 18% price decline.“Candle” refers to the representation of an asset’s open, high, low and closing price on a given day. The RSI is a technical indicator that measures price momentum. An increase in negative trading volume following a greater than 10% decrease in price implies that bearish sentiment of an asset remains.In a bearish confirmation, both price and RSI slope downward in tandem. Should the RSI slope begin to flatten as prices decline, that is an indication that the downturn is weakening.There are early signs this is occurring, as Thursday’s RSI is up slightly. Its overall value of 40, however, implies that BTC is fairly priced at the moment.On-chain metrics show that potential room to the downside still exists. The percentage of unique BTC averages in profit has fallen to 52.05%, per blockchain analytics firm Glassnode.The metric reached a 2022 peak of 82% in March, when BTC was trading near $48,000. The lowest the metric has reached in recent history was 41% in March 2020, when BTC was trading at $5,000. Still, at the current 52% level, it's beginning to approach the sub-50% range, where BTC would be considered oversold.The supply of BTC held by addresses with a balance between 1,000 and 10,000 coins has dropped 8% since this February, and 12% since its peak in February 2021. Those coins are likely being absorbed by smaller investors as supplies for addresses holding less than 1,000 BTC have increased over the identical time period.On a more promising, on-chain note, “Whale Net Volume” on exchanges has turned negative, signaling that addresses that hold 1,000 or more coins are moving coins off centralized exchanges. The significance of this trend is that large deposits onto exchanges often signal that investors are looking to sell bitcoin.Altcoin RoundupAs XRP Rallies, Some Traders Buy Year-End Bullish Bets in the Options Market: Investors are snapping up bullish bets in anticipation of a resolution of Ripple's legal tussle with the U.S. Securities and Commission.

Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: NextEra Energy Inc. NEE, The Southern Co. SO, PepsiCo Inc. PEP, Corteva Inc. CTVA and McKesson Corp. MCK.Here are highlights from Thursday’s Analyst Blog:Bet on These 5 Ultra-Defensive Stocks for the Rest of 2022On Sep 21, the Fed raised the benchmark interest rate by 75 basis points in the third consecutive FOMC meeting. With this, the Fed Fund rate jumped to the range of 3-3.25% from a mere 0-0.25% in early March. The central bank has hiked the interest rate by 3% so far in 2022.Such a rigorous rate hike has happened for the first time since 1990, when the central bank recognized the Fed Fund rate as the principal monetary policy tool. This is not the end. What is alarming is that the central bank has projected more toughness for the rest of 2022 and 2023.Consequently, Wall Street melted on Sep 21, with the three major stock indexes — the Dow, the S&amp;P 500 and the Nasdaq Composite — falling 1.7%, 1.7% and 1.8%, respectively. At this juncture, defensive sectors like utilities, consumer staples and health care will be best bets.Further, we need to select those stocks from those sectors that have a low beta and good dividend yield in order to counter extreme volatility. Five such stocks with a favorable Zacks Rank are — NextEra Energy Inc., The Southern Co., PepsiCo Inc., Corteva Inc. and McKesson Corp.Fed Provides a Grim OutlookThe U.S. stock markets have been witnessing extreme volatility in 2022.

Year to date, the Dow, the S&amp;P 500 and the Nasdaq Composite – have plunged 16.9%, 20.5% and 28.3%, respectively.Story continuesA large section of economists and financial experts were expecting that the September FOMC meeting would be the last one for a 75 basis point rate hike. However, the Fed has raised the median of the Fed Fund rate to 4.4% in September from 3.4% in June.This means, the range of the benchmark lending rate at the end of 2022 will be 4.25-4.5%, indicating 75 basis-point and 50 basis-point interest rate hike in November and December, respectively.Market participants were expecting a rate cut in 2023, which is out of the question now as the central bank has projected that the median of the benchmark interest rate will reach 4.6% in 2023. This means another 50 basis-point rate hike throughout 2023. The first rate cut is not expected before 2024 as the Fed is expecting inflation to come down to its target rate of 2% in 2025.Investment analysts have estimated that there exists a 75% probability of the U.S. economy entering a recession either in the last quarter of 2022 or in the first quarter of 2023. The Fed has projected that the U.S. GDP will by a mere 0.2% in 2022 after contracting in the first two quarters.

The ulterior motive of such partnerships is to infuse digitization into the global economy.The decision to stretch the Mastercard-TripLink partnership to the Asia-Pacific territory seems perfectly timed as the cross-border trade of the local tourism sector is finally witnessing a turnaround post the COVID-19 pandemic gloom that imposed restrictions.

136,4f685358-eff9-3b0f-b428-255e7487d1e7,QCOM,2022-09-23,"With 73% ownership, QUALCOMM Incorporated (NASDAQ:QCOM) boasts of strong institutional backing",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/73-ownership-qualcomm-incorporated-nasdaq-110042680.html,1663930842,STORY,['QCOM'],"[Every investor in QUALCOMM Incorporated (NASDAQ:QCOM) should be aware of the most powerful shareholder groups. And the group that holds the biggest piece of the pie are institutions with 73% ownership. In other words, the group stands to gain the most (or lose the most) from their investment into the company.Since institutional have access to huge amounts of capital, their market moves tend to receive a lot of scrutiny by retail or individual investors. Therefore, a good portion of institutional money invested in the company is usually a huge vote of confidence on its future.In the chart below, we zoom in on the different ownership groups of QUALCOMM. Check out our latest analysis for QUALCOMM ownership-breakdownWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About QUALCOMM?Institutions typically measure themselves against a benchmark when reporting to their own investors, so they often become more enthusiastic about a stock once it's included in a major index. We would expect most companies to have some institutions on the register, especially if they are growing.We can see that QUALCOMM does have institutional investors; and they hold a good portion of the company's stock. This can indicate that the company has a certain degree of credibility in the investment community. However, it is best to be wary of relying on the supposed validation that comes with institutional investors. They too, get it wrong sometimes. If multiple institutions change their view on a stock at the same time, you could see the share price drop fast. It's therefore worth looking at QUALCOMM's earnings history below. Of course, the future is what really matters.earnings-and-revenue-growthInvestors should note that institutions actually own more than half the company, so they can collectively wield significant power. Hedge funds don't have many shares in QUALCOMM. The Vanguard Group, Inc. is currently the company's largest shareholder with 9.5% of shares outstanding. In comparison, the second and third largest shareholders hold about 7.3% and 4.2% of the stock.Story continuesOn studying our ownership data, we found that 25 of the top shareholders collectively own less than 50% of the share register, implying that no single individual has a majority interest.While studying institutional ownership for a company can add value to your research, it is also a good practice to research analyst recommendations to get a deeper understand of a stock's expected performance. Quite a few analysts cover the stock, so you could look into forecast growth quite easily.Insider Ownership Of QUALCOMMWhile the precise definition of an insider can be subjective, almost everyone considers board members to be insiders. Management ultimately answers to the board. However, it is not uncommon for managers to be executive board members, especially if they are a founder or the CEO.Most consider insider ownership a positive because it can indicate the board is well aligned with other shareholders. However, on some occasions too much power is concentrated within this group.Our information suggests that QUALCOMM Incorporated insiders own under 1% of the company. Being so large, we would not expect insiders to own a large proportion of the stock. Collectively, they own US$152m of stock. It is always good to see at least some insider ownership, but it might be worth checking if those insiders have been selling. General Public OwnershipThe general public, who are usually individual investors, hold a 26% stake in QUALCOMM. While this group can't necessarily call the shots, it can certainly have a real influence on how the company is run.Next Steps:While it is well worth considering the different groups that own a company, there are other factors that are even more important. To that end, you should learn about the   2 warning signs  we've spotted with QUALCOMM (including 1 which can't be ignored) .But ultimately  it is the future, not the past, that will determine how well the owners of this business will do. Therefore we think it advisable to take a look at this free report showing whether analysts are predicting a brighter future.NB: Figures in this article are calculated using data from the last twelve months, which refer to the 12-month period ending on the last date of the month the financial statement is dated.

When evaluating insider transactions, knowing whether insiders are buying versus if they selling is usually more beneficial, as the latter can be open to many interpretations. However, if numerous insiders are selling, shareholders should investigate more.While we would never suggest that investors should base their decisions solely on what the directors of a company have been doing, logic dictates you should pay some attention to whether insiders are buying or selling shares. See our latest analysis for Lockheed Martin The Last 12 Months Of Insider Transactions At Lockheed MartinThe Chief Operating Officer, Frank St. John, made the biggest insider sale in the last 12 months. That single transaction was for US$3.5m worth of shares at a price of US$438 each. That means that an insider was selling shares at around the current price of US$422. While insider selling is a negative, to us, it is more negative if the shares are sold at a lower price. Given that the sale took place at around current prices, it makes us a little cautious but is hardly a major concern.All up, insiders sold more shares in Lockheed Martin than they bought, over the last year. The chart below shows insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last year. By clicking on the graph below, you can see the precise details of each insider transaction!insider-trading-volumeIf you like to buy stocks that insiders are buying, rather than selling, then you might just love this free list of companies. (Hint: insiders have been buying them).Insiders At Lockheed Martin Have Sold Stock RecentlyThere was substantially more insider selling, than buying, of Lockheed Martin shares over the last three months. In total, insider Gregory Ulmer sold US$2.9m worth of shares in that time. Meanwhile insider John Donovan bought US$250k worth. Because the selling vastly outweighs the buying, we'd say this is a somewhat bearish sign.Story continuesInsider Ownership Of Lockheed MartinLooking at the total insider shareholdings in a company can help to inform your view of whether they are well aligned with common shareholders. A high insider ownership often makes company leadership more mindful of shareholder interests. Insiders own 0.06% of Lockheed Martin shares, worth about US$70m. This level of insider ownership is good but just short of being particularly stand-out. It certainly does suggest a reasonable degree of alignment.So What Do The Lockheed Martin Insider Transactions Indicate?Unfortunately, there has been more insider selling of Lockheed Martin stock, than buying, in the last three months. Despite some insider buying, the longer term picture doesn't make us feel much more positive. Insider ownership isn't particularly high, so this analysis makes us cautious about the company. We're in no rush to buy! While we like knowing what's going on with the insider's ownership and transactions, we make sure to also consider what risks are facing a stock before making any investment decision. To assist with this, we've discovered 3 warning signs that you should run your eye over to get a better picture of Lockheed Martin.If you would prefer to check out another company -- one with potentially superior financials -- then do not miss this free list of interesting companies, that have HIGH return on equity and low debt.For the purposes of this article, insiders are those individuals who report their transactions to the relevant regulatory body.

And then in order to say what they're worth, we take the present value of those, which you will use a discount rate … and that's what makes all boats rise and decline together.”So where should investors hide?Cash is obviously not optimal as inflation erodes its purchasing power. Dalio previously said that “cash is trash” and he still believes so.“Cash is still going to be a negative real return, it's still going to be a trashy investment depends how it compares with the others.”Let’s take a look at what Dalio’s hedge fund holds instead.Procter &amp; Gamble (PG)According to Bridgewater’s latest 13F filing to the SEC, the fund held 6.75 million shares of Procter &amp; Gamble at the end of June. With a market value of around $970 million at the time, it was the largest holding in Dalio’s portfolio.This shouldn’t come as a surprise. P&amp;G is a defensive stock with the ability to deliver cash returns to investors in different economic environments.In April, P&amp;G’s board announced a 5% dividend increase, marking the company’s 66th consecutive annual payout increase. The stock currently offers an annual dividend yield of 2.7%.Story continuesIt’s easy to see why the company is able to maintain such a streak.P&amp;G is a consumer staples giant with a portfolio of trusted brands like Bounty paper towels, Crest toothpaste, Gillette razor blades, and Tide detergent. These are products that households buy on a regular basis, regardless of what the economy is doing.Johnson &amp; Johnson (JNJ)With deeply entrenched positions in consumer health, pharmaceuticals and medical devices markets, healthcare giant Johnson &amp; Johnson has delivered consistent returns to investors throughout economic cycles.Many of the company’s consumer health brands — such as Tylenol, Band-Aid, and Listerine — are household names. In total, JNJ has 29 products each capable of generating over $1 billion in annual sales.Not only does Johnson &amp; Johnson post recurring annual profits, but it also grows them consistently: Over the past 20 years, Johnson &amp; Johnson’s adjusted earnings have increased at an average annual rate of 8%.JNJ announced its 60th consecutive annual dividend increase in April and now yields 2.7%.As of June 30, Bridgewater held 4.33 million shares of JNJ, worth approximately $769 million at the time and making the healthcare giant its second-largest holding.iShares Core MSCI Emerging Markets ETF (IEMG)Bridgewater’s third-largest holding is the iShares Core MSCI Emerging Markets ETF.IEMG tracks the MSCI Emerging Markets Investable Market Index and provides investors with convenient exposure to stocks in emerging markets like China, India, and Brazil.The ETF holds more than 2,600 stocks. Its top holdings include industry heavyweights like chipmaking giant Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing, Chinese tech behemoth Tencent Holdings, and Indian multinational conglomerate Reliance Industries.In a conversation with another investing legend Jeremy Grantham earlier this year, Dalio said he’s looking at countries with good income statements and balance sheets that can weather the storm.“Emerging Asia is very interesting. India is interesting,” he says.Bridgewater held 15.31 million shares of IEMG at the end of Q2, valued at $751 million.What to read nextSign up for our MoneyWise investing newsletter to receive a steady flow of actionable ideas from Wall Street's top firms.Warren Buffett likes these 2 investment opportunities outside of the stock marketA Wells Fargo study shows that nearly half of Americans are leaning on their credit card rewards to help offset some of the costs of everyday purchasesThis article provides information only and should not be construed as advice.

Shares have lost about 4% in that time frame, outperforming the S&amp;P 500.Will the recent negative trend continue leading up to its next earnings release, or is Medtronic due for a breakout? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at its most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important catalysts.Medtronic Q1 Earnings Top Estimates, Margins ExpandMedtronic reported adjusted earnings per share of $1.13 in first-quarter fiscal 2023, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 0.9%. However, adjusted earnings plunged 19.9% from the year-ago figure of $1.41 per share. Currency-adjusted EPS came in at $1.16 for the quarter.Without certain one-time adjustments — including restructuring and associated costs, amortization and restructuring expenses, acquisition-related costs and certain medical device regulation charges, among others— GAAP earnings per share was 70 cents, reflecting a 25% surge from the year-ago reported figure.Total RevenuesWorldwide revenues in the reported quarter grossed $7.37 billion, down 4% on an organic basis (excluding the impacts of currency) and 7.7% on a reported basis. Meanwhile, the top line exceeded the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 2.3%.The Q1 organic revenues, according to the company, reflect the unfavorable market impact of supply chain shortages, coupled with a strong comparison with high ventilator sales and a rebound in market procedures post the third COVID-19 wave in the year-ago period.Q1 in DetailsIn the quarter under review, U.S. sales (51% of total revenues) declined 8% on a reported basis (down 9% on an organic basis) to $3.77 billion. Non-U.S. developed market revenues totaled $2.33 billion (32% of total revenues), depicting a 10% drop on a reported basis (up 2% on an organic basis).Emerging market revenues (17% of total revenues) amounted to $1.28 billion, down 1% on a reported basis (up 2% organically).Story continuesSegment DetailsThe company generates revenues from four major segments, namely Cardiovascular Portfolio, Medical Surgical Portfolio, Neuroscience Portfolio and Diabetes.In the fiscal first quarter, Cardiovascular revenues fell 1.3% at CER to $2.71 billion, reflecting low-single-digit organic decline in Cardiac Rhythm &amp; Heart Failure (CRHF) and Coronary &amp; Peripheral Vascular (CPV) and flat year-over-year organic performance in Structural Heart &amp; Aortic (SHA).CRHF sales totaled $1.39 billion, down 1.3% year over year at CER. Revenues from SHA were down 0.4% at CER to $741 million. CPV revenues were down 2.6% at CER to $579 million.For the Cardiovascular segment, we projected $2.73 billion of revenues in the fiscal first quarter.In Medical Surgical, worldwide sales totaled $2 billion, down 8.9% year over year at CER. The quarter registered high-single-digit declines in Surgical Innovations (SI) and Respiratory, Gastrointestinal &amp; Renal (RGR). Excluding the impact of ventilator sales, Medical Surgical’s first-quarter revenues declined 7% year over year organically.In Neuroscience, worldwide revenues of $2.12 billion were down 1.1% year over year at CER, driven by mid-single-digit organic declines in Cranial &amp; Spinal Technologies (CST) and Neuromodulation, partially offset by mid-single-digit increases in Specialty Therapies, all on an organic basis.For the Neuroscience segment, we projected fiscal first-quarter revenues of $1.99 billion.Revenues in the Diabetes group rose 0.3% at CER to $541 million. Due to the lack of new product approvals, United States revenue declined in mid-teens in Q1, offset by low-double digit organic growth in non-U.S. developed markets and mid-teens organic growth in emerging markets. The company’s international sales were led by mid-twenties sales growth of continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) products and low-double-digit growth in consumable sales, offset by low-single digit declines in durable insulin pumps sales.MarginsGross margin in the reported quarter contracted 161 basis points (bps) to 65.9% on a 9.9% fall in gross profit to $4.86 billion.Research and development expenses fell 7.7% to $692 million. Selling, general and administrative expenses rose 0.8% to $2.57 billion.Adjusted operating margin contracted 454 bps year over year to 21.7%.GuidanceMedtronic has reaffirmed its fiscal 2023 financial guidance for revenue growth and EPS.The company continues to expect organic revenue growth in the band of 4-5% from fiscal 2022. Considering current foreign exchange rate, fiscal 2023 revenues are expected to be negatively impacted by $1.4 to $1.5 billion (compared to the prior expectation of $1.0-$1.1 billion impact). The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company’s fiscal 2023 worldwide revenues is pegged at $31.97 billion.Full-year adjusted earnings per share projection has also been maintained in the range of $5.53 to $5.65, including an estimated 17 to 22 cents negative impact from foreign exchange. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the year’s adjusted earnings is $5.55.How Have Estimates Been Moving Since Then?In the past month, investors have witnessed a downward trend in estimates review.VGM ScoresCurrently, Medtronic has an average Growth Score of C, though it is lagging a lot on the Momentum Score front with an F. However, the stock was allocated a grade of B on the value side, putting it in the top 40% for this investment strategy.Overall, the stock has an aggregate VGM Score of C. If you aren't focused on one strategy, this score is the one you should be interested in.OutlookEstimates have been broadly trending downward for the stock, and the magnitude of these revisions indicates a downward shift. Notably, Medtronic has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). We expect an in-line return from the stock in the next few months.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Within Cardiovascular, cardiac rhythm management, one of Medtronic’s largest businesses, continued to build on the company’s category leadership. Within cardiac rhythm management, Medtronic’s pacing business continued to outperform the market banking on strong global growth of its Micra leadless pacemaker family as it enters new geographies and expands penetration in existing markets. Micra grew 15% in fiscal Q1, including high 70s growth in Japan, mid-teens growth in Western Europe, and high 30s growth in emerging markets.Further, ICDs (Implantable cardioverter-defibrillator) within cardiac rhythm management are expected to gain significant market share with the upcoming launch of Aurora extravascular ICD.

So, you might want to look at some of the facts that could shape the stock's performance in the near term.Over the past month, shares of this medical device company have returned -4%, compared to the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's -10.2% change. During this period, the Zacks Medical - Products industry, which Medtronic falls in, has lost 7.7%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?Although media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.Revisions to Earnings EstimatesHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.We essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.For the current quarter, Medtronic is expected to post earnings of $1.28 per share, indicating a change of -3% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -2.1% over the last 30 days.For the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $5.53 points to a change of -0.4% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has changed -0.3%.For the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $5.83 indicates a change of +5.4% from what Medtronic is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -2.8%.Story continuesHaving a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, Medtronic is rated Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPS12-month consensus EPS estimate for MDT _12MonthEPSChartUrlRevenue Growth ForecastWhile earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.In the case of Medtronic, the consensus sales estimate of $7.74 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of -1.3%. The $31.6 billion and $32.93 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of -0.3% and +4.2%, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryMedtronic reported revenues of $7.37 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -7.7%. EPS of $1.13 for the same period compares with $1.41 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $7.2 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +2.34%. The EPS surprise was +0.89%.Over the last four quarters, Medtronic surpassed consensus EPS estimates three times. The company topped consensus revenue estimates just once over this period.ValuationNo investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.While comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.The Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.Medtronic is graded B on this front, indicating that it is trading at a discount to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.ConclusionThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Medtronic. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

And out of all of the metrics and results to consider, earnings is one of the most important.The earnings figure itself is key, but a beat or miss on the bottom line can sometimes be just as, if not more, important. Therefore, investors should consider paying close attention to these earnings surprises, as a big beat can help a stock climb even higher.2 Stocks to Add to Your WatchlistThe Zacks Expected Surprise Prediction, or ESP, works by locking in on the most up-to-date analyst earnings revisions because they can be more accurate than estimates from weeks or even months before the actual release date. The thinking is pretty straightforward: analysts who provide earnings estimates closer to the report are likely to have more information. With this in mind, the Expected Surprise Prediction compares the Most Accurate Estimate (being the most recent) against the overall Zacks Consensus Estimate. The percentage difference provides the ESP figure.Now that we understand what the ESP is and how beneficial it can be, let's dive into a stock that currently fits the bill. Crown Castle (CCI) earns a Zacks Rank #3 right now and its Most Accurate Estimate sits at $1.84 a share, just 27 days from its upcoming earnings release on October 19, 2022.Crown Castle's Earnings ESP sits at 0.64%, which, as explained above, is calculated by taking the percentage difference between the $1.84 Most Accurate Estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.83.CCI is part of a big group of Finance stocks that boast a positive ESP, and investors may want to take a look at SL Green (SLG) as well.Slated to report earnings on October 19, 2022, SL Green holds a #3 (Hold) ranking on the Zacks Rank, and it's Most Accurate Estimate is $1.66 a share 27 days from its next quarterly update.Story continuesFor SL Green, the percentage difference between its Most Accurate Estimate and its Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.65 is 0.57%.CCI and SLG's positive ESP metrics may signal that a positive earnings surprise for both stocks is on the horizon.Find Stocks to Buy or Sell Before They're ReportedUse the Zacks Earnings ESP Filter to turn up stocks with the highest probability of positively, or negatively, surprising to buy or sell before they're reported for profitable earnings season trading.

(MRK) a Buy Now?",Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/trending-stock-merck-co-inc-130001597.html,1663851601,STORY,['MRK'],"[Merck (MRK) has recently been on Zacks.com's list of the most searched stocks. Therefore, you might want to consider some of the key factors that could influence the stock's performance in the near future.Over the past month, shares of this pharmaceutical company have returned -6.1%, compared to the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's -10.2% change. During this period, the Zacks Large Cap Pharmaceuticals industry, which Merck falls in, has lost 7%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?While media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.Revisions to Earnings EstimatesRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.We essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.For the current quarter, Merck is expected to post earnings of $1.74 per share, indicating a change of -0.6% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed +0.7% over the last 30 days.For the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $7.33 points to a change of +21.8% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has changed +0.2%.For the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $7.19 indicates a change of -1.9% from what Merck is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed +0.4%.Story continuesWith an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for Merck.The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPS12-month consensus EPS estimate for MRK _12MonthEPSChartUrlProjected Revenue GrowthEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.For Merck, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $14.4 billion indicates a year-over-year change of +9.5%. For the current and next fiscal years, $59.04 billion and $57.94 billion estimates indicate +17.7% and -1.9% changes, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryMerck reported revenues of $14.59 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +28%. EPS of $1.87 for the same period compares with $1.31 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $13.85 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +5.36%. The EPS surprise was +11.98%.The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.ValuationNo investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.While comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.As part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.Merck is graded B on this front, indicating that it is trading at a discount to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.Bottom LineThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Merck. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

163,351b69ae-dcc1-36c1-9ace-eee3ba78af17,ROK,2022-09-23,"A Look At The Intrinsic Value Of Rockwell Automation, Inc. (NYSE:ROK)",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/look-intrinsic-value-rockwell-automation-122014005.html,1663935614,STORY,['ROK'],"[Today we'll do a simple run through of a valuation method used to estimate the attractiveness of Rockwell Automation, Inc. (NYSE:ROK) as an investment opportunity by projecting its future cash flows and then discounting them to today's value. This will be done using the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model. Believe it or not, it's not too difficult to follow, as you'll see from our example!We would caution that there are many ways of valuing a company and, like the DCF, each technique has advantages and disadvantages in certain scenarios. Anyone interested in learning a bit more about intrinsic value should have a read of the Simply Wall St analysis model. See our latest analysis for Rockwell Automation The MethodWe are going to use a two-stage DCF model, which, as the name states, takes into account two stages of growth. The first stage is generally a higher growth period which levels off heading towards the terminal value, captured in the second 'steady growth' period. In the first stage we need to estimate the cash flows to the business over the next ten years. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.A DCF is all about the idea that a dollar in the future is less valuable than a dollar today, and so the sum of these future cash flows is then discounted to today's value:10-year free cash flow (FCF) estimate2023202420252026202720282029203020312032 Levered FCF ($, Millions) US$1.28bUS$1.41bUS$1.59bUS$1.67bUS$1.73bUS$1.78bUS$1.83bUS$1.87bUS$1.92bUS$1.96bGrowth Rate Estimate SourceAnalyst x14Analyst x7Analyst x4Analyst x3Est @ 3.55%Est @ 3.07%Est @ 2.73%Est @ 2.49%Est @ 2.33%Est @ 2.21% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 7.3% US$1.2kUS$1.2kUS$1.3kUS$1.3kUS$1.2kUS$1.2kUS$1.1kUS$1.1kUS$1.0kUS$971(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$12bStory continuesWe now need to calculate the Terminal Value, which accounts for all the future cash flows after this ten year period. For a number of reasons a very conservative growth rate is used that cannot exceed that of a country's GDP growth. In this case we have used the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield (1.9%) to estimate future growth. In the same way as with the 10-year 'growth' period, we discount future cash flows to today's value, using a cost of equity of 7.3%.Terminal Value (TV)= FCF2032 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$2.0b× (1 + 1.9%) ÷ (7.3%– 1.9%) = US$37bPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$37b÷ ( 1 + 7.3%)10= US$19bThe total value is the sum of cash flows for the next ten years plus the discounted terminal value, which results in the Total Equity Value, which in this case is US$30b. To get the intrinsic value per share, we divide this by the total number of shares outstanding. Relative to the current share price of US$225, the company appears about fair value at a 14% discount to where the stock price trades currently. Valuations are imprecise instruments though, rather like a telescope - move a few degrees and end up in a different galaxy. Do keep this in mind.dcfThe AssumptionsNow the most important inputs to a discounted cash flow are the discount rate, and of course, the actual cash flows. You don't have to agree with these inputs, I recommend redoing the calculations yourself and playing with them. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Rockwell Automation as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 7.3%, which is based on a levered beta of 1.256. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.Next Steps:Although the valuation of a company is important, it is only one of many factors that you need to assess for a company. DCF models are not the be-all and end-all of investment valuation. Instead the best use for a DCF model is to test certain assumptions and theories to see if they would lead to the company being undervalued or overvalued. For instance, if the terminal value growth rate is adjusted slightly, it can dramatically alter the overall result. For Rockwell Automation, we've put together three further aspects you should assess:Risks: Be aware that  Rockwell Automation is showing  4 warning signs in our investment analysis , and 1 of those shouldn't be ignored...Future Earnings: How does ROK's growth rate compare to its peers and the wider market?

Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: Shell plc SHEL, The Williams Companies WMB, Cheniere Energy LNG, APA Corp. APA and TechnipFMC FTI.Here are highlights from Wednesday’s Analyst Blog:Oil &amp; Gas Roundup: Successions, Acquisitions and MoreIt was a week when both oil and natural gas prices continued their decline.On the news front, Europe’s largest oil company Shell plc announced the departure of chief executive officer (CEO) Ben van Beurden next year, while energy infrastructure operator The Williams Companies closed the buyout of natural gas storage firm NorTex Midstream. Developments associated with Cheniere Energy, APA Corp. and TechnipFMC also made it to the headlines.Overall, it was another bearish seven-day period for the sector. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures lost 1.9% to close at $85.11 per barrel, while natural gas prices decreased 2.9% to end at $7.764 per million British thermal units (MMBtu).U.S. oil prices moved lower as the Energy Information Administration (""EIA"") showed a build in stockpiles in its latest weekly release. As it is, crude remained under pressure from familiar fears revolving around high inflation and slowing growth. A stronger greenback, which can weaken dollar-denominated commodities like crude, also contributed to the downside.Natural gas notched a bigger weekly loss, primarily due to a bearish inventory report. Unfavorable weather forecasts and a spurt in production have also been blamed for pushing prices lower.Recap of the Week’s Most-Important Stories1. Shell has declared that the incumbent CEO of the company — Ben van Beurden — will step down from his position by the end of 2022. Wael Sawan, SHEL’s head of gas and renewables, will succeed Ben van Beurden and take charge as the CEO, starting Jan 1, 2023.Story continuesBen van Beurden, however, will continue working as an adviser to the board till Jun 30, 2023, after which he will leave the group. He has been serving as the CEO of the British energy major since January 2014. Prior to this, Ben van Beurden served as the downstream director and as the executive vice president of chemicals before that. During his tenure, Shell acquired the British multinational oil and gas company — BG Group plc — which turned out to be one of SHEL’s largest acquisitions in decades.Presently serving as the director of integrated gas, renewables and energy solutions, Wael Sawan is expected to help continue Shell’s green transition strategy, which aims at cutting down the firm’s greenhouse-gas emissions and its transformational strategy initiated by Ben van Beurden. Having previously worked as the director of upstream, Sawan has been part of the organization for more than 25 years. (Shell to Replace Current CEO With Wael Sawan in 2023)2. The Williams Companies recently announced that it has concluded the $423-million deal to acquire Houston-based NorTex Midstream, a fully contracted natural gas pipeline and storage asset, from the private equity firm Tailwater Capital’s affiliate.As part of the contract, the Tulsa, OK-based pipeline operator will take over NorTex assets. These include roughly about 80 miles of natural gas transmission pipelines along with 36 billion cubic feet of natural gas storage in the Dallas-Fort Worth market.Per WMB, NorTex assets offer crucial service to almost 4 GW of gas-fired power generation, allowing Texas energy providers to meet peak demand effectively. The assets also enable Williams to provide storage services for the Permian gas directed toward the rising Gulf Coast LNG demand. (Williams Acquires NorTex Midstream Assets for $423M)3. Cheniere Energy, the Houston, TX-based liquefied natural gas exporter, recently announced its intention to pay higher dividends and augment share buybacks while adding to its production units.This comes at a time when Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) Cheniere’s profits are up due to mounting energy prices and liquefied natural gas demand as a result of Europe trying to find alternatives to Russian gas over Moscow’s military action in Ukraine.You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.LNG will hike its annual dividend by 20% to $1.58 per share from the $1.32 payout initiated last year. Moreover, the firm projects more than $20 billion of available cash through 2026 and more than $20 per share of run-rate distributable cash flow. The full-year 2022 distributable cash flow forecast was increased to the range of $8.1 billion-$8.6 billion from the earlier guidance range of $6.9-$7.4 billion. (Cheniere to Increase Repurchase, Raises Earnings Forecast)4   APA Corp. recently got approval from the board of directors to increase the quarterly dividend by 12.5 cents to 25 cents per share. The new payout will be on Nov 22 to its common shareholders of record on Oct 21. Following the 100% hike this quarter, APA’s annual dividend of $1 per share yields 2.41%, which is better than the S&amp;P 500’s 1.54%.The macro environment for U.S. Exploration &amp; Production operators like APA remains robust, thanks to high commodity prices and improved fundamentals that should aid long-term growth. This positive backdrop, together with APA’s significant debt profile improvement and healthy cash flows, allows the company to reward investors with a dividend hike.APA management sees the dividend hike as part of its commitment to return a minimum of 60% of free cash flow to shareholders each year. However, stock buyback continues to be the company’s preferred tool to distribute cash, with APA adding another 40 million shares to its buyback authorization. (APA Ups Shareholder Returns: Hikes Dividend, Expands Buyback)5   TechnipFMC declared that it was awarded a “significant” engineering, procurement, construction and installation contract by TotalEnergies for its Lapa North East field situated in the pre-salt Santos Basin offshore Brazil. Located in the pre-salt Santos Basin, the Lapa field commenced oil production in 2016 via the MODEC-supplied FPSO Cidade de Caraguatatuba MV27.Per the contract, the French-American, U.K.-domiciled oilfield services major will reconfigure and set up umbilicals and flexible pipes in a new configuration that will further secure the production of the field. Per TechnipFMC’s definition of a significant contract, the deal is worth between $75 million and $250 million.President, Subsea, at TechnipFMC, Jonathan Landes, mentioned that the Brazilian offshore market is becoming more diverse concerning the scope of work as well as customer opportunity. “On Lapa North East, we are working with a valued client with whom we have built a trusted relationship. By offering the flexibility of a phased campaign, we are helping TotalEnergies accelerate its schedule and begin production sooner,"" he added. (TechnipFMC Gets EPCI Contract From TTE Offshore Brazil)Price PerformanceWith oil being in red for the week, stocks were down too. The Energy Select Sector SPDR — a popular way to track energy companies — was down 2.7% last week. But over the past six months, the sector tracker has increased 8.5%.What’s Next in the Energy World?Following last week’s sliding fortunes for oil and gas, market participants will closely track the regular releases to look for further guidance on the direction of prices. In this context, the U.S. government’s statistics on oil and natural gas — one of the few solid indicators that come out regularly — will be on energy traders' radar.Data on rig count from the oilfield service firm Baker Hughes, which is a pointer to the trends in U.S. crude/natural gas production, is closely followed too. News related to the ongoing Russia-Ukraine geopolitical conflict and the potential demand boost from the easing of coronavirus lockdowns in China will be the other factors that will dictate the near-term price movement of the commodities.Why Haven’t You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?Our 5 best-performing strategies have blown away the S&amp;P's impressive +28.8% gain in 2021.

ERJ revealed its strategic partnership agreement with L3Harris Technologies LHX to build an Agile Tanker aircraft, which will be an advanced version of the KC-390 Millennium tactical tanker aircraft, for the U.S. Air Force. The agreement is expected to support the U.S. Air Force in meeting operational imperatives and refueling needs in a contested mission area.Details of the AgreementAs part of the agreement, Embraer and L3Harris will be involved in augmenting the operational capabilities of the KC-390 Millennium tactical tanker aircraft. The work involves upgrading the aircraft with advanced technology to make it efficient and sustainable in contested mission areas.LHX and ERJ will be outfitting the aircraft with tactical network settings that will support the Joint All-Domain Command and Control requirements of the air force.Benefits of the UpgradeThe KC-390 Millennium is a new-generation military multi-mission airlift aircraft. It brings unrivaled mobility, high productivity and operation flexibility at low operational costs on a single and unique modern platform.The aircraft can refuel military aircraft with a variable speed drogue, receive fuel, and take off and land from short and improvised runways. These allow for greater mission area coverage.The latest initiative by Embraer and L3Harris to upgrade the aircraft with meaningful and critical operational capabilities will increase its versatility and resiliency to perform in challenging mission areas. Moreover, Embraer’s state-of-the-art platform and systems, in combination with L3Harris’ mission-driven solutions, should make this next-generation aircraft more attractive for the air force.This may result in a steady flow of contracts from Pentagon involving the upgraded KC-390 aircraft for Embraer, thus boosting its revenue generation prospects from defense businesses.Growth ProspectsThe continuously changing dynamics of the defense landscape and rising warfare challenges are propelling the demand for technologically advanced weapons and equipment. In this context, aerial refueling plays a vital role in military operations and may witness an increase in demand in the days ahead amid the current threat environment.Story continuesPer the report from MarketWatch, the global military aerial refueling tanker market size is likely to expand at a CAGR of 12.3% over the 2022-2030 period. Such abounding growth prospects may benefit Embraer, considering its capability in building the aircraft tanker, which suits military missions.Other defense players that can enjoy the perks of the expanding aerial refueling tanker market size are as follows:Boeing’s BA KC-46 features multiple layers of combat-ready defensive countermeasures to detect, avoid, defeat and survive threats. The KC-46A provides data and fuel to the joint force.

But Airbus' plans to build 75 A320neo-family jets a month in 2025, up from around 50 now, have met with some scepticism.The head of Raytheon Technologies, which owns engine maker Pratt &amp; Whitney, told a conference last week that Faury ""might say rate 75, but we think rate 65 is doable"" by 2025.Faury called the comments ""really unhelpful"" and said engine makers were worried by the timing, not the number. ""They believe in 75. I can be quoted because I checked,"" he told investors.Raytheon had no immediate comment.Story continuesReuters reported this week Airbus had relaxed pressure on suppliers to commit to the 2025 deadline, leaving room for it to slip to 2026, but was sticking to targets for now. The company has not said when in 2025 it might hit the 75 goal.The key, suppliers say, is when targets can be hit consistently.""We will see when we plan to hit rate 75, in (20)25 hopefully. I am committed to (20)25. That's probably something we will be communicating more precisely on at our full-year results,"" Faury said on Friday.A220 UPGRADEAirbus meanwhile gave the strongest hint yet that it plans to launch a bigger version of its 110-to-130-seat A220 passenger jet but gave no clues about the decision's timing.A stretched version of the lightweight airplane makes a lot of sense, ""but we don't want to be right too early"", Faury said.The A220 was developed with an eye on the main part of the jet market but Canada's Bombardier struggled to keep up with the investments needed to displace Airbus and Boeing and sold its aerospace jewel to Airbus in 2018.Airbus has faced higher-than-expected costs on the loss-making programme but believes it can break even by mid-decade.An A220-500 would begin the process of replacing the 150-seat-plus A320neo, Europe's aerospace cash-cow and a major battleground in the transatlantic war for sales with Boeing.Airbus has seized a commanding lead in the main part of the single-aisle market, most recently through the larger A321neo, which finance chief Dominik Asam said would have an increasing proportion of sales.Although Airbus was born as a producer of wide-body long-haul jets with the A300, which took flight 50 years ago next month, its biggest commercial success by far has been in workhorse single-aisle jets made popular by budget carriers.Improvements in the largest single-aisle jets have eaten into the lower end of a market reserved for decades for wide-body jets like Boeing's 747, 777 and 787 or the Airbus A350.Faury said Airbus aimed to step up competition with Boeing in the wide-body market, starting with the new A350 Freighter. Experts say Boeing dominates air cargo and has so far outsold the A350 with its future 777X Freighter. (Reporting by Tim Hepher; Editing by Edmund Blair and Mark Potter)]"

Through these projects, GRID Alternatives provides energy independence for tribal members in these regions; clean, low-cost energy for low-income homeowners; and job training. As part of the program, about 75 families total will receive solar systems. In addition, GRID will provide 4,500 hours of job training.Recently, GRID Alternatives released an interim stewardship report, highlighting how the grant is boosting solar energy production and job training and the many people who are benefiting.GRID Makes the GradeDespite continuing COVID-19 outbreaks and supply chain disruptions, GRID Alternatives has made enormous progress. Since November 2021, the organization has helped reduce carbon emissions by 6,568 tons—the equivalent of 24 million pounds of coal.In San Diego and the Bay Area, the organization’s solar projects will save families around $2.7 million over their systems’ lifetimes. In San Diego, GRID has installed 39 batteries, which provide energy storage outside the power grid. Recipients with battery-supplemented systems can also access solar-generated electricity during power outages caused during heat waves, high winds, and wildfires.To reach President Biden’s goal of producing 100% clean electricity by 2035, the solar industry will need around 900,000 workers. GRID is now expanding its Bay Area training facility, which provides hands-on experience for more than 325 people each year.Story continuesThe grant is also expanding job training in San Diego and the Solar Works DC program in the nation’s capital. These two offices have trained 93 people so far.“With Illumina’s support, we have been able to continue bridging access gaps in the renewable energy industry, decreasing energy bills for homeowners across the country, increasing energy sovereignty on Tribal lands, and providing hands-on job training experience to our communities of concern,” said the report.Illumina’s Climate Action“At Illumina, we have integrated our sustainability goals into our giving strategy, acknowledging that often the most vulnerable populations in the world are being impacted the most by climate change despite having contributed the least to the climate crisis,” says Sharon Vidal, senior director of Corporate Social Responsibility &amp; Sustainability. “There is tremendous opportunity for innovation, collaboration, and community engagement to collectively make an impact and protect our communities and the planet.”The grant to GRID Alternatives is part of Illumina’s climate action strategy, which includes a target to contribute $20 million to sustainability initiatives and other programs to decarbonize the world by 2030. In reducing emissions related to its own operations and value chain, Illumina was one of the first companies in the world to receive approval for its net-zero targets from the Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi).To learn more about how Illumina is integrating environmental sustainability, click here.View additional multimedia and more ESG storytelling from Illumina on 3blmedia.comView source version on newsdirect.com: https://newsdirect.com/news/illumina-grant-boosts-climate-action-and-job-training-364661921]"

Henry Ford is among an early group of healthcare providers in the U.S. to offer this MCED test.Henry Ford Health logo (PRNewsfoto/Henry Ford Health System)""We are entering an era of unprecedented ability to detect cancer at its earliest stages, which may ultimately help save many lives,"" said Adnan Munkarah, M.D., Chief Clinical Officer at Henry Ford Health. ""Diagnosing and treating cancer at an earlier stage often leads to more favorable outcomes. We are excited to offer this MCED blood test, which research shows can detect a cancer signal shared across more than 50 types of cancer through a single blood draw.""The Galleri test is intended for use in those who are at an elevated risk of cancer, such as individuals ages 50 or older. Some younger people may also have an elevated risk of cancer, which is why Henry Ford is making the Galleri test available to patients who are 22 years or older, have no history of cancer or have been cancer-free at least three years, and are not currently pregnant.""We believe that multi-cancer early detection tests like Galleri are the new front on the war against cancer and will enable us to dramatically increase cancer detection from screening in the population, with the goal of improving public health,"" said Bob Ragusa, Chief Executive Officer at GRAIL. ""We are excited to work with Henry Ford Health in adding Galleri as a complement to U.S. guideline-recommended cancer screenings.""Story continuesGalleri MCED test can detect many cancers that are not commonly screened for today to allow for earlier treatment, and can be incorporated into a routine healthcare visit. If a cancer signal is found, the results can point to where in the body the cancer is coming from. This can help healthcare providers guide next steps.""Routine cancer screenings remain essential for early detection,"" said Ben Movsas, M.D., Medical Director of Henry Ford Health Cancer. ""But a MCED blood test can be used in addition to guideline-recommended cancer screenings, such as mammography, colonoscopy, prostate-specific antigen or cervical cancer screening. In a clinical study, the test also detected some cancer types, such as pancreatic, ovarian and esophageal, that currently lack routine recommended screening guidelines. This can provide a way to detect cancers earlier that are often not detected until a later stage.""All cells in the body release DNA into the bloodstream, but DNA from cancer cells is different from the DNA of healthy cells. The Galleri test looks at the DNA in a patient's blood to determine if any of it may have come from cancer cells. In a clinical study, the Galleri test demonstrated the ability to detect a shared signal from more than 50 types of cancer, more than 45 of which lack recommended screening tests today. Final results from the first PATHFINDER study, an interventional study that examined how well an MCED test can be integrated into clinical practice, were presented at the European Society for Medical Oncology (ESMO) Congress 2022 and demonstrated Galleri's performance was consistent with findings from previous observational and case-controlled studies, underscoring the potential real-world ability of Galleri to find more cancers in earlier stages.""For many people, routine cancer screenings are a part of the regular care they receive from their primary care physician,"" said Dan Passerman, D.O., Chair of Family Medicine at Henry Ford Health. ""The ability to include this test in a routine visit, and to obtain actionable health information as a result, will help people protect their health in a very meaningful and convenient way.""Because the test is not currently covered by insurance, the Galleri MCED test is an out-of-pocket cost. Patients may be eligible to participate in the interventional PATHFINDER 2 study, which is evaluating the implementation and performance of Galleri in a clinical care setting. The study is currently enrolling individuals who meet the eligibility requirements, which include:50 years or older and receive care at Henry Ford Health.Have never been diagnosed with cancer or have been cancer-free at least three years.Are not participants in previous or ongoing GRAIL sponsored studies.Henry Ford team members and their dependents who are enrolled in a Health Alliance Plan (HAP) of Michigan insurance plan may be eligible for a test at no cost.Galleri is available by physician order only.

The Galleri multi-cancer early detection test can detect signals across more than 50 types of cancer, as defined by the American Joint Committee on Cancer Staging Manual, through a routine blood draw. When a cancer signal is detected, the Galleri test predicts the cancer signal origin, or where the cancer is located in the body, with high accuracy to help guide the next steps to diagnosis. The Galleri test requires a prescription from a licensed healthcare provider and should be used in addition to recommended cancer screenings such as mammography, colonoscopy, prostate-specific antigen (PSA) test, or cervical cancer screening. It is intended for use in people with an elevated risk of cancer, such as those aged 50 or older.For more information about Galleri, visit galleri.com.Important Galleri Safety InformationThe Galleri test is recommended for use in adults with an elevated risk for cancer, such as those aged 50 or older. The Galleri test does not detect all cancers and should be used in addition to routine cancer screening tests recommended by a healthcare provider. Galleri is intended to detect cancer signals and predict where in the body the cancer signal is located. Use of Galleri is not recommended in individuals who are pregnant, 21 years old or younger, or undergoing active cancer treatment.Results should be interpreted by a healthcare provider in the context of medical history, clinical signs and symptoms. A test result of ""No Cancer Signal Detected"" does not rule out cancer. A test result of ""Cancer Signal Detected"" requires confirmatory diagnostic evaluation by medically established procedures (e.g., imaging) to confirm cancer.If cancer is not confirmed with further testing, it could mean that cancer is not present or testing was insufficient to detect cancer, including due to the cancer being located in a different part of the body. False-positive (a cancer signal detected when cancer is not present) and false-negative (a cancer signal not detected when cancer is present) test results do occur.

Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: NextEra Energy Inc. NEE, The Southern Co. SO, PepsiCo Inc. PEP, Corteva Inc. CTVA and McKesson Corp. MCK.Here are highlights from Thursday’s Analyst Blog:Bet on These 5 Ultra-Defensive Stocks for the Rest of 2022On Sep 21, the Fed raised the benchmark interest rate by 75 basis points in the third consecutive FOMC meeting. With this, the Fed Fund rate jumped to the range of 3-3.25% from a mere 0-0.25% in early March. The central bank has hiked the interest rate by 3% so far in 2022.Such a rigorous rate hike has happened for the first time since 1990, when the central bank recognized the Fed Fund rate as the principal monetary policy tool. This is not the end. What is alarming is that the central bank has projected more toughness for the rest of 2022 and 2023.Consequently, Wall Street melted on Sep 21, with the three major stock indexes — the Dow, the S&amp;P 500 and the Nasdaq Composite — falling 1.7%, 1.7% and 1.8%, respectively. At this juncture, defensive sectors like utilities, consumer staples and health care will be best bets.Further, we need to select those stocks from those sectors that have a low beta and good dividend yield in order to counter extreme volatility. Five such stocks with a favorable Zacks Rank are — NextEra Energy Inc., The Southern Co., PepsiCo Inc., Corteva Inc. and McKesson Corp.Fed Provides a Grim OutlookThe U.S. stock markets have been witnessing extreme volatility in 2022. Inflation has soared to a 40-year high and in order to combat mounting inflation, the Fed has adopted an ultra-hawkish monetary stance. Year to date, the Dow, the S&amp;P 500 and the Nasdaq Composite – have plunged 16.9%, 20.5% and 28.3%, respectively.Story continuesA large section of economists and financial experts were expecting that the September FOMC meeting would be the last one for a 75 basis point rate hike. However, the Fed has raised the median of the Fed Fund rate to 4.4% in September from 3.4% in June.This means, the range of the benchmark lending rate at the end of 2022 will be 4.25-4.5%, indicating 75 basis-point and 50 basis-point interest rate hike in November and December, respectively.Market participants were expecting a rate cut in 2023, which is out of the question now as the central bank has projected that the median of the benchmark interest rate will reach 4.6% in 2023. This means another 50 basis-point rate hike throughout 2023. The first rate cut is not expected before 2024 as the Fed is expecting inflation to come down to its target rate of 2% in 2025.Investment analysts have estimated that there exists a 75% probability of the U.S. economy entering a recession either in the last quarter of 2022 or in the first quarter of 2023. The Fed has projected that the U.S. GDP will by a mere 0.2% in 2022 after contracting in the first two quarters. The projection for the unemployment rate has been scaled up to 4.4% by next year from the current projection of 3.7%.Our Top PicksWe have narrowed our search to five low-beta (beta value &gt; 0 &lt;1) high-yielding defensive stocks that have strong potential for the rest of 2022.

177,827d7229-bc9a-3f84-97ed-b73061f0b381,SO,2022-09-23,Bet on These 5 Ultra-Defensive Stocks for the Rest of 2022,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/bet-5-ultra-defensive-stocks-121612167.html,1663848972,STORY,"['CTVA', 'COMP', '^GSPC', 'NEE', 'MCK', 'PEP', 'SO']","[On Sep 21, the Fed raised the benchmark interest rate by 75 basis points in the third consecutive FOMC meeting. With this, the Fed Fund rate jumped to the range of 3-3.25% from a mere 0-0.25% in early March. The central bank has hiked the interest rate by 3% so far in 2022.Such a rigorous rate hike has happened for the first time since 1990, when the central bank recognized the Fed Fund rate as the principal monetary policy tool. This is not the end. What is alarming is that the central bank has projected more toughness for the rest of 2022 and 2023.Consequently, Wall Street melted on Sep 21, with the three major stock indexes — the Dow, the S&amp;P 500 and the Nasdaq Composite — falling 1.7%, 1.7% and 1.8%, respectively. At this juncture, defensive sectors like utilities, consumer staples and health care will be best bets.Further, we need to select those stocks from those sectors that have a low beta and good dividend yield in order to counter extreme volatility. Five such stocks with a favorable Zacks Rank are — NextEra Energy Inc. NEE, The Southern Co. SO, PepsiCo Inc. PEP, Corteva Inc. CTVA and McKesson Corp.MCK.Fed Provides a Grim OutlookThe U.S. stock markets have been witnessing extreme volatility in 2022. Inflation has soared to a 40-year high and in order to combat mounting inflation, the Fed has adopted an ultra-hawkish monetary stance. Year to date, the Dow, the S&amp;P 500 and the Nasdaq Composite – have plunged 16.9%, 20.5% and 28.3%, respectively.A large section of economists and financial experts were expecting that the September FOMC meeting would be the last one for a 75 basis point rate hike. However, the Fed has raised the median of the Fed Fund rate to 4.4% in September from 3.4% in June.This means, the range of the benchmark lending rate at the end of 2022 will be 4.25-4.5%, indicating 75 basis-point and 50 basis-point interest rate hike in November and December, respectively.Market participants were expecting a rate cut in 2023, which is out of the question now as the central bank has projected that the median of the benchmark interest rate will reach 4.6% in 2023. This means another 50 basis-point rate hike throughout 2023. The first rate cut is not expected before 2024 as the Fed is expecting inflation to come down to its target rate of 2% in 2025.Story continuesInvestment analysts have estimated that there exists 75% probability of the U.S. economy entering a recession either in the last quarter of 2022 or in the first quarter of 2023. The Fed has projected that the U.S. GDP will by a mere 0.2% in 2022 after contracting in the first two quarters. The projection for the unemployment rate has been scaled up to 4.4% by next year from the current projection of 3.7%.Our Top PicksWe have narrowed our search to five low-beta (beta value &gt; 0 &lt;1) high-yielding defensive stocks that have strong potential for the rest of 2022.

This change lagged the S&amp;P 500's daily loss of 0.84%. At the same time, the Dow lost 0.36%, and the tech-heavy Nasdaq lost 0.12%.Heading into today, shares of the athletic apparel maker had lost 10.43% over the past month, outpacing the Consumer Discretionary sector's loss of 11.36% and lagging the S&amp;P 500's loss of 10.24% in that time.Investors will be hoping for strength from Nike as it approaches its next earnings release, which is expected to be September 29, 2022. In that report, analysts expect Nike to post earnings of $0.93 per share. This would mark a year-over-year decline of 19.83%. Our most recent consensus estimate is calling for quarterly revenue of $12.33 billion, up 0.65% from the year-ago period.Looking at the full year, our Zacks Consensus Estimates suggest analysts are expecting earnings of $3.78 per share and revenue of $50.36 billion. These totals would mark changes of +0.8% and +7.81%, respectively, from last year.Investors might also notice recent changes to analyst estimates for Nike. These revisions typically reflect the latest short-term business trends, which can change frequently. As such, positive estimate revisions reflect analyst optimism about the company's business and profitability.Based on our research, we believe these estimate revisions are directly related to near-team stock moves. To benefit from this, we have developed the Zacks Rank, a proprietary model which takes these estimate changes into account and provides an actionable rating system.The Zacks Rank system, which ranges from #1 (Strong Buy) to #5 (Strong Sell), has an impressive outside-audited track record of outperformance, with #1 stocks generating an average annual return of +25% since 1988. The Zacks Consensus EPS estimate has moved 0.42% lower within the past month. Nike is currently sporting a Zacks Rank of #4 (Sell).Story continuesIn terms of valuation, Nike is currently trading at a Forward P/E ratio of 26.38. Its industry sports an average Forward P/E of 13.57, so we one might conclude that Nike is trading at a premium comparatively.It is also worth noting that NKE currently has a PEG ratio of 2.11. The PEG ratio is similar to the widely-used P/E ratio, but this metric also takes the company's expected earnings growth rate into account. The Shoes and Retail Apparel was holding an average PEG ratio of 1.64 at yesterday's closing price.The Shoes and Retail Apparel industry is part of the Consumer Discretionary sector.

Let's battle it out in our ""Bull versus Bear"" segment for the week, the spotlight right now on Nike-- Barclays managing director Adrienne Yih, who just downgraded the athletic apparel brand to equal weight, alongside Evercore ISI senior managing director Omar Saad, who maintains his outperform rating, join us now to make their cases.So I'm just gonna kind of throw the jump ball here, but I do want to start with you, Adrienne, because, as I look through your notes here, you're looking really at some of the inventory risks and really looking more near-term for your thesis around Nike. Kind of break down exactly what you're looking at near-term here on the inventory side. And is that something that can be navigated through to get them into kind of a more bullish stature?ADRIENNE YIH: Yes. So the inventory issue is sort of near to medium-term. We actually think, from a broader perspective, wholesale in general tends to follow frontline retail, frontline retail being those who sell directly to the consumer, by about six months. So we always say that, you know, frontline retailers will bear the out season to the rate at which they sold through the current season.So we think there's gonna be a really, really tough holiday. And part of this is really about the forward 2023 purchasing behavior in the wholesale channel. Remember, Nike still has about 55% in the wholesale channel even though they're making great strides in moving to DTC. So that's sort of the crux of kind of the near to medium term.- And, Omar, just kind of staying on that same thread of inventory, as of right now, I mean, you've sent us some interesting stats on, particularly, this sneaker supercycle here more broadly. Break that down for us and what we need to know about where Nike is sitting right now in that's that sneaker supercycle.Story continuesI haven't had any issues trying to find the drops that are the latest and greatest. And perhaps that might be part of the issue in this near term that really feeds into the bear case.OMAR SAAD: Yeah, no, thanks for the question. Thanks for having me. Hey, Adrienne.Look, inventory is a result of supply and demand. And as you know, we've come through a very strange supply period with everything ranging from factory shutdowns to pork backups. And so Nike, along with many of the companies we cover, especially heading into the heavier back-to-school fall holiday season in North America, bringing in inventory early to avoid the kind of supply backups that have been happening the last couple of years.I think 65% of their North America inventory is in transit at the close of the last balance sheet. I think you back out some of those extraordinarily high in-transit numbers, and the inventory levels start to look more normalized. And, again, I think you pointed to the right equation. We are in the beginning of a sneaker supercycle.There's this perception that sneakers have been booming for the last three years. And the reality is you can do a deep dive unit analysis, as we have in some of our recent research we sent you guys, there's been a dip in unit sales even with the rise of all the new sneaker brands.We think there's still a lot of demand out there. People are wearing sneakers more. They're wearing through sneakers more. Their feet are absolutely used to the comfort that sneakers and other comfortable footwear brings during COVID and are hesitant to go back to uncomfortable dress shoes on a daily basis just for special occasions.And they want to own more sneakers in their closet for different wearing occasions, not just to wear to work or to wear for workout. You know, sneakers are kind of almost becoming a highly specialized accessory. And Nike, you know, we think, is the best positioned company to take advantage of this massive sneaker supercycle. Say that fast three times.- Exactly. You know, I want to shift gears and talk particularly around the world here, where we're looking at some of the relative strength that Nike may have in some regions versus others where, Adrienne, you've laid out that China still remains a near-term volatile landscape and a longer-term question mark here. How long do you believe it will take for Nike and some of the other footwear brands, quite frankly, to really work through that volatility?OMAR SAAD: So the big question here for Nike and China is kind of the algorithm used to be sort of low to mid-teen growth on a CAGR basis. And they would, you know, just, every year, beat that, right? So they were more of this 20%-plus.No one expects them to return to that, but we're really looking for them to return to positive growth. That could actually happen in the next couple of quarters. What we would say there is the landscape-- there's a big question mark as to whether this is just sort of a short to medium-term COVID transitory issue or whether this has more of a bent toward sort of the rise of domestic brands right.So the two kind of equivalent Chinese brands would be Li-Ning and Anta. And if you look at their first-half yearly numbers, Li-Ning was up 22%. Anta was taking share of 14% in the market.You compare that to Adidas, down 35%, and then, for the first half of the year that we know of, from Nike, down 12%. And so we think that this is a very sort of uncertain time period. The good news is that upon the reopenings that we've seen sort of in the back half of September, you have seen a resurgence in their DTC business, the direct-to-consumer business.Adidas is taking about 400 million euro, or $400 million worth of inventory back out of that channel. So they're reversing forward sales. There's just quite a bit of inventory, a lot of promotions, in that China marketplace.- From one of the very real marketplaces, the IRL marketplaces, if you will, in greater China, to one of the budding ones in the metaverse, which I know is part of your bulk case, Omar-- I mean, when does that actually become reality to, really, a contribution portion of what Nike's future growth may look like?OMAR SAAD: Thanks for the question. I do agree with Adrienne that China is a near-term risk. But I think there could be a big boom in China when they reopen. And the higher-end brands tend to win in that exuberant environment as we saw in North America and Europe over the last nine months. But, you know, I also think Nike has a huge opportunity globally to sell what are effectively virtual shoes.The blockchain technology really is a transformational technology for these types of products because it can ensure the uniqueness and the rarity of these types of virtual products, frankly, in a way that you could never do with physical products. A physical rare shoe on someone's foot could always be a fake. You can't be sure.With blockchain technology, if I have, you know, one of the 10 rarest XYZ shoes, with blockchain technology, I can prove that with absolute certainty online. And the other thing I would say is the rare shoe collectors, which, Brad, it sounds like you might be one of those sneakerheads, a lot of those really rare shoes that they do collect, they never get worn because it ruins the value if you wear them.So in reality, they're kind of already like virtual shoes. And so and if you can bring that kind of rarity and uniqueness and cool factor to a much, much more mass audience, and who knows what price point-- some of the most rare ones will be very expensive, and the more common ones, I think, will be less expensive.So people-- to use them with their avatars, it could become a very scalable, high-revenue model with really high margins, obviously, because there's no physical cogs in those products.- Omar, rare Air or not, I wear the shoes. I'm sorry. I don't know how people--OMAR SAAD: Love that. Love that.- --buy these shoes and just let them sit on the shelf to resell at some point. That's great. But for me and my house and myself, perhaps, I'm going to be wearing these rare Airs out here.We've got to leave the conversation there.OMAR SAAD: Love that.- We'd love to have the conversation in person and have this reoccurring. Evercore ISI senior managing director Omar Saad and Barclays managing director Adrienne Yih, thank you both.]"

188,646f9e78-fa1e-3b27-9abe-2a6496f8c642,NKE,2022-09-23,Earnings Preview: Nike (NKE) Q1 Earnings Expected to Decline,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/earnings-preview-nike-nke-q1-140002015.html,1663855202,STORY,['NKE'],"[Nike (NKE) is expected to deliver a year-over-year decline in earnings on higher revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended August 2022. This widely-known consensus outlook gives a good sense of the company's earnings picture, but how the actual results compare to these estimates is a powerful factor that could impact its near-term stock price.The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report, which is expected to be released on September 29. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call, it's worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise.Zacks Consensus EstimateThis athletic apparel maker is expected to post quarterly earnings of $0.93 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of -19.8%.Revenues are expected to be $12.33 billion, up 0.7% from the year-ago quarter.Estimate Revisions TrendThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 1.04% lower over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts.Earnings WhisperEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. Our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) -- has this insight at its core.The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Story continuesThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Nike?For Nike, the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of -3.24%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #4.So, this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Nike will beat the consensus EPS estimate.Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?While calculating estimates for a company's future earnings, analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that Nike would post earnings of $0.81 per share when it actually produced earnings of $0.90, delivering a surprise of +11.11%.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times.Bottom LineAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.Nike doesn't appear a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.Stay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Our analysis will employ the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model. Believe it or not, it's not too difficult to follow, as you'll see from our example!Companies can be valued in a lot of ways, so we would point out that a DCF is not perfect for every situation. For those who are keen learners of equity analysis, the Simply Wall St analysis model here may be something of interest to you. See our latest analysis for International Business Machines Crunching The NumbersWe use what is known as a 2-stage model, which simply means we have two different periods of growth rates for the company's cash flows. Generally the first stage is higher growth, and the second stage is a lower growth phase. In the first stage we need to estimate the cash flows to the business over the next ten years. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.A DCF is all about the idea that a dollar in the future is less valuable than a dollar today, so we discount the value of these future cash flows to their estimated value in today's dollars:10-year free cash flow (FCF) forecast2023202420252026202720282029203020312032 Levered FCF ($, Millions) US$11.1bUS$10.1bUS$9.54bUS$9.22bUS$9.06bUS$9.00bUS$9.01bUS$9.07bUS$9.16bUS$9.28bGrowth Rate Estimate SourceAnalyst x1Est @ -8.86%Est @ -5.62%Est @ -3.35%Est @ -1.77%Est @ -0.65%Est @ 0.12%Est @ 0.67%Est @ 1.05%Est @ 1.32% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 7.2% US$10.3kUS$8.8kUS$7.7kUS$7.0kUS$6.4kUS$5.9kUS$5.5kUS$5.2kUS$4.9kUS$4.6k(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$66bStory continuesWe now need to calculate the Terminal Value, which accounts for all the future cash flows after this ten year period. The Gordon Growth formula is used to calculate Terminal Value at a future annual growth rate equal to the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield of 1.9%. We discount the terminal cash flows to today's value at a cost of equity of 7.2%.Terminal Value (TV)= FCF2032 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$9.3b× (1 + 1.9%) ÷ (7.2%– 1.9%) = US$179bPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$179b÷ ( 1 + 7.2%)10= US$89bThe total value is the sum of cash flows for the next ten years plus the discounted terminal value, which results in the Total Equity Value, which in this case is US$156b. In the final step we divide the equity value by the number of shares outstanding. Relative to the current share price of US$125, the company appears a touch undervalued at a 27% discount to where the stock price trades currently. The assumptions in any calculation have a big impact on the valuation, so it is better to view this as a rough estimate, not precise down to the last cent.dcfImportant AssumptionsWe would point out that the most important inputs to a discounted cash flow are the discount rate and of course the actual cash flows. Part of investing is coming up with your own evaluation of a company's future performance, so try the calculation yourself and check your own assumptions. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at International Business Machines as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 7.2%, which is based on a levered beta of 1.244. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.Looking Ahead:Although the valuation of a company is important, it is only one of many factors that you need to assess for a company. DCF models are not the be-all and end-all of investment valuation. Preferably you'd apply different cases and assumptions and see how they would impact the company's valuation. For instance, if the terminal value growth rate is adjusted slightly, it can dramatically alter the overall result. Why is the intrinsic value higher than the current share price? For International Business Machines, we've compiled three fundamental factors you should further research:Risks: You should be aware of the 2 warning signs for International Business Machines (1 is significant!) we've uncovered before considering an investment in the company.Management:Have insiders been ramping up their shares to take advantage of the market's sentiment for IBM's future outlook?

This change outpaced the S&amp;P 500's 0.84% loss on the day. Elsewhere, the Dow lost 0.36%, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq lost 0.19%.Coming into today, shares of the refiner had lost 9.65% in the past month. In that same time, the Oils-Energy sector lost 4.09%, while the S&amp;P 500 lost 10.24%.Investors will be hoping for strength from Marathon Petroleum as it approaches its next earnings release, which is expected to be November 1, 2022. The company is expected to report EPS of $6.43, up 780.82% from the prior-year quarter. Our most recent consensus estimate is calling for quarterly revenue of $37.16 billion, up 13.96% from the year-ago period.For the full year, our Zacks Consensus Estimates are projecting earnings of $21.76 per share and revenue of $166.33 billion, which would represent changes of +788.16% and +37.54%, respectively, from the prior year.Investors might also notice recent changes to analyst estimates for Marathon Petroleum.

Marathon Petroleum is currently a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).Valuation is also important, so investors should note that Marathon Petroleum has a Forward P/E ratio of 4.35 right now.

205,41eeaae9-cce6-340e-8f45-14646aba903f,MPC,2022-09-23,Avoiding Value Traps in a Rising Rate Environment,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/avoiding-value-traps-rising-rate-191407080.html,1663874047,STORY,"['DINO', 'MARUY', 'MPC', 'DTEGY']","[Value stocks, as many people already know, are those that are undervalued at a given time. They may be undervalued because investors have somehow not discovered them, or because they fell out of favor at a certain time and their turnaround went unnoticed.Stocks could also be undervalued because there are internal issues such as competitive weakness, lack of innovation and R&amp;D, weak fundamentals, deteriorating asset base, increasing debt, poor cash flows, accounting irregularities or any number of other reasons. Such stocks tend to languish, never quite living up to investor expectations. These may be referred to as value traps.Avoiding value traps in an environment of Fed-induced weakness is therefore tricky. What would you look for as indicators, for example? The Fed’s actions would be raising costs and hurting demand across sectors. So how could you tell if the weakness is attributable to weak fundamentals or the Fed?There is no easy answer to this except that you must go deeper into the financials and also study what management says on calls. Right now, management of most companies are calling out the macro situation, and if they have international operations, they also refer to geopolitics or China shutdowns, and so on. Some are still seeing supply constraints and rising input costs that are again related to these factors.Since high inflation and weak stock market returns are likely to stay for a while, one way of playing the market is by getting into stocks that benefit from the Fed’s actions. Financials immediately come to mind. Energy is another hot spot despite recent actions that have helped price moderation. And in case of a recession, staples and essentials get the upper hand.But simply picking the sectors that are relatively attractive isn’t enough. Because you could be missing an opportunity to buy value stocks that will pay off in the long term. Therefore, there is the need to look for other positives.Story continuesFor example, otherwise strong companies could pay a dividend (or increase it) since the scope for growing the business is limited by current conditions. They could also decide to pay down their debt.A look at analyst estimates also help because they’re the ones that do the field research and can therefore tell what is actually going on with the company.Today, I’ve picked five Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stocks that also have a Value Score of A. And true enough, the A is justified by their low valuation in terms of P/E, P/S and PEG. But as discussed above, a low valuation isn’t enough, particularly in the current environment. Therefore, a proper discussion on their pros and cons is in order:First up is HF Sinclair Corporation DINO, which has also got an A for Value, Growth and Momentum, according to the Zacks Style Score system. This is an indicator that the stock is attractive for all investor types. It belongs to the Alternative Energy – Other industry (top 27% of Zacks-classified industries), and benefits from the ongoing strength in the energy market.HF Sinclair beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 24.2% in the last quarter. Analysts appear to be impressed with its prospects. They’ve raised the 2022 estimate 15.5% in the last 60 days. The 2023 estimate also increased 8.6%.The company’s return on assets is showing an increasing trend while its debt-cap is showing a decreasing trend. The net cash position, while still negative, is also showing a positive trend.Its dividend currently yields 3.17%.With a P/E of 5.1X, PEG of 0.34 and P/S of 0.38, the shares are clearly undervalued. They are also trading at a significant discount to the median level over the last five and ten years because of steady price declines this year, especially since May.Considering all of these factors, we can say that DINO stock is not a value trap. It really is worth buying.Deutsche Telekom AG DTEGY is another stock with a number of positive metrics. Other than the #1 rank, the shares have an A for Value, B for Growth and C for Momentum. The Diversified Communication Services industry to which it belongs is in the top 38% of Zacks-ranked industries.Earnings estimates on this stock are up slightly in the last 60 days. For 2022, they’re up an average 6 cents (4.5%) while for 2023, they’re up 8 cents (5.6%). Therefore, analysts are optimistic about the company’s growth both this year and in the next. And that’s despite the fact that there’s a fair chance of a recession next year.Its return on assets was impacted by the pandemic but has been rising in recent quarters. Its Debt-cap has been declining steadily and the current 56% level is not excessive. While negative, the net cash per share shows an improving trend in recent quarters.It also pays an attractive dividend that currently yields 3.63%.Its valuation too is cheap. Based on P/E, the shares are trading at a slight discount to their median level over the past year, as well as the last five years. The PEG of 0.76 and P/S of 0.69 also indicate that investors are discounting its earnings growth and sales.#1 ranked Marubeni Corporation MARUY has a Value Score of A but D for both Growth and Momentum. It belongs to the Diversified Operations industry (top 22%).In the last 60 days, analysts have raised their 2022 estimate by 35.6%. The 2023 estimate was raised by 32.3%. Therefore, the growth outlook is very good.Its return on assets has been increasing for several quarters now while the debt-cap has been declining steadily. The net cash situation isn’t too great however, as most of its assets are fixed and liquidity is low. This is not a negative given that assets are fruitfully deployed.Marubeni’s dividend currently yields 4.81%.The P/S of 0.21 and PEG of 0.53 indicate significant undervaluation. On a P/E basis, valuation is in line with historical levels (lower than median value).Marathon Petroleum Corporation MPC has an A for Value, Growth and Momentum. Plus, it belongs to the Oil and Gas - Refining and Marketing industry, which is in the top 4% of Zacks-classified industries.The earnings beat in the last quarter was by 15.7%. In the last 60 days, the 2022 estimate increased 14.5% while the 2023 estimate increased 13.0%. As discussed above, this is encouraging.Return on assets is showing an encouraging trend and the debt cap appears reasonable. Net cash is negative.The company also pays a dividend that yields 2.45%.Despite these positives, the shares are trading close to their lowest point over the past year on a P/E basis. The PEG is a mere 0.19 while the P/S is 0.29.Unum Group UNM shares have Value, Growth and Momentum scores of A, C and A, respectively. They belong to the Insurance - Accident and Health industry (top 7%).The company beat earnings estimates by 55.3% in the last quarter. In the last 60 days, the 2022 estimate is up 18.4% while the 2023 estimate is up 5.3%.Like the others, its return on assets is setting an increasing trend line and the debt cap is at acceptable levels. Net cash is negative.Its dividend currently yields 3.31%.ConclusionAlthough relatively difficult to hunt down, value stocks with a satisfactory growth outlook are safer bets. They can minimize the chances of falling into a value trap. And a proper study of the financials is also necessary.One-Month Price PerformanceWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

The field has a total capacity of 330 million tons.The project will deviate a large volume of CO2, which would otherwise be released into the atmosphere. This is equivalent to the CO2 emissions of more than three million homes or more than six million cars per year.Eni has been operating the Hewett-depleted gas field for more than four decades. The company can leverage its extensive experience and subsurface know-how in the Hewett field to develop the CCS project. Notably, the depleted gas field is expected to be up and running by 2027.Oil and gas companies are actively involved in CCS projects as they offer a transition pathway for the rapid and effective reduction of CO2 emissions beyond what can be achieved by alternative methods like electrification and renewable fuels. Thus, the use of carbon capture and storage in reducing industrial emissions offers an excellent opportunity.Beside this, Eni is engaged in an initiative to decarbonize industries such as automotive, ceramics, materials, energy and waste disposal in the U.K. southeast. The CCS project is likely to be involved in the initiative. Eni will play a crucial role by transporting and storing CO2 in the Hewett field.The industry-led initiative could significantly contribute to the development of a hydrogen economy in the UK. It could become a turning point in addressing the decarbonization goals of the U.K. southeast.Notably, Eni is preparing to start drilling operations on an exploration well in the Sureste Basin offshore Mexico later in 2022. The drilling activities will be performed with a Valaris-owned semi-submersible rig.Story continuesCompany ProfileHeadquartered in Rome, Italy, Eni is one of the leading integrated energy players in the world.Zacks Rank &amp; Other Stocks to ConsiderEni currently carries a Zack Rank #2 (Buy).Investors interested in the energy sector might look at the following companies that presently flaunt a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

207,8530c80b-b4d0-32ee-9650-95e802506972,MPC,2022-09-23,Make Sure to Put Marathon (MPC) on Your Investment Shortlist,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/sure-put-marathon-mpc-investment-122212254.html,1663849332,STORY,"['MPC', 'MRO', 'ESTE', 'CHK', 'MUSA', '^GSPC']","[Even as fears revolving around high inflation and slowing growth somewhat cloud the outlook for Oil/Energy, it has continued to be the best S&amp;P 500 sector this year. The space has generated a total return of almost 37% in 2022 compared with the S&amp;P 500’s loss of around 20%.Apart from a constructive fundamental picture, the sector is enjoying support from geopolitical uncertainty amid Russia’s military operations in Ukraine. In March, crude prices surged to multi-year highs of $130 on concerns about supplies from Russia, which is one of the world's largest producers of the commodity.While oil has pulled back from those lofty levels, the conflict showing no sign of a quick resolution, the risk of dwindling inventory and the influential oil exporters’ group OPEC agreeing on a production curtailment. These give the commodity enough reasons to stay elevated in the near-to-medium term.Naturally, some stocks have been impressive since the start of the year. These also have strong earnings trends to back up their moves.One such company is Marathon Petroleum MPC. The Findlay, OH-based company is a leading independent refiner, transporter and marketer of petroleum products. MPC, in its current form, came into existence following the 2011 spin-off of Houston, TX-based Marathon Oil Corporation’s refining/sales business into a separate, independent and publicly-traded entity. It operates primarily in two segments: Refining and Marketing, and Pipeline Transportation (or Midstream).Let’s discuss the reasons that make Marathon Petroleum an attractive pick:Solid Rank and VGM ScoreMarathon Petroleum is a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stock in the Zacks Oil and Gas - Refining &amp; Marketing industry, which carries a Zacks Industry Rank #7 — placing it in the top 3% of more than 250 Zacks industries. In addition to the favorable rank, MPC enjoys a Zacks Value Style Score of A, Growth of A, and Momentum of A to help it round out with a VGM Score of A. Our research shows that stocks with a VGM Score of A or B when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 or 2 (Buy) offer the best upside potential.Story continuesEstimate-Beating Recent EarningsMPC posted robust Q2 results on Aug 2, with earnings per share of $10.61, comfortably beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $9.17 and compared with a profit of merely 67 cents per share in the year-ago period. The company’s bottom line was favorably impacted by the stronger-than-expected performance of its Refining &amp; Marketing segment, whose operating income totaled $7.1 billion, ahead of its Zacks Consensus Estimate by 108.4%. The company repurchased shares worth $4.1 billion during the May-July period and has now completed more than 80% of its target to buy back $15 billion in common stock.Current Pullback a Buying OpportunityAfter MPC shares bottomed out (in the mid-to-high teens) during the start of the pandemic, they have turned it around in style. MPC peaked in June at around $115 but have fallen to under $100 since then. Despite this drop, the stock is still up 48% on the year while the markets have gone lower. This powerful uptrend during a bear market indicates that investors should take advantage of the discounted levels and start looking at the name to see if its right for their portfolio. With the company experiencing the best market conditions in years, we believe that the Marathon Petroleum stock has enough firepower left to keep chugging along.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchAnalyst Estimates RaisedMPC’s earnings revisions have also trended in the right direction over the last 60 days, as analysts have consistently taken up their numbers. As a matter of fact, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for Marathon Petroleum’s 2022 bottom line has gone up from a profit of $19 to $21.55 over the past 60 days, while next year’s number is a rise from $11.88 per share to $13.40.Fundamental StrengthMarathon Petroleum's $23.3 billion acquisition of Andeavor has integrated the premier assets of both the companies, bolstering the scale and leadership position of the combined entity in the United States. As it is, the company’s access to lower-cost crude in the Permian, Bakken and Canada helps it to benefit from the differentials. MPC’s portfolio of midstream operations bode well too, somewhat reducing its exposure to volatile commodity price fluctuations.The industry’s improved fundamentals in the form of constrained supply and robust demand have led to rising refining profitability for the players involved. With product inventories running low and no near-term solution to replenish them, margins (especially for diesel and jet fuel) have set all-time highs. While margins have moderated from those spectacular levels, they are still reasonably high. Overall, elevated consumption paired with considerably lower refining capacity in the OECD countries should provide a tailwind for refinery profits throughout the year. In particular, constrained Russian fuel exports in the wake of the Ukraine conflict have further tightened refining fundamentals. As a reflection of this, Marathon Petroleum’s Refining &amp; Marketing segment reported operating income of $7.1 billion in the second quarter, which soared from the year-ago profit of just $224 million.Last year, Marathon Petroleum sold its Speedway business to Japanese retail group Seven &amp; i Holdings — owner of the 7-Eleven convenience store chain — for $21 billion. Apart from providing Marathon Petroleum with a much-needed cash infusion, the disposal of its Speedway-branded gas stations came with a supply agreement per which Marathon Petroleum will provide about 7.7 billion gallons of gasoline per year to 7-Eleven, thus ensuring a steady revenue stream.Bottom LineGiven this backdrop, this appears to be the best time to consider buying Marathon Petroleum. While there are some apprehensions that the company may have gotten too far ahead of itself, especially with the inflation-trigerred cost increases, the tightness in product demand should keep refining margins elevated moving forward. All these suggest strong long-term cash flows that should support higher price points for its shares.Other Energy Stocks to BuyAlong with Marathon Petroleum, investors interested in the energy sector might look at Chesapeake Energy CHK, Murphy USA MUSA and Earthstone Energy ESTE, each sporting a Zacks Rank #1, currently.You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Chesapeake Energy: Chesapeake is valued at some $12.4 billion.

209,520bb66b-3414-34a5-baa0-40bc2480033c,AES,2022-09-23,Do Options Traders Know Something About AES Stock We Don't?,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/options-traders-know-something-aes-123612066.html,1663850172,STORY,"['AES', 'AESC']","[Investors in The AES Corporation AES need to pay close attention to the stock based on moves in the options market lately. That is because the Jan 20, 2023 $3.00 Put had some of the highest implied volatility of all equity options today.What is Implied Volatility?Implied volatility shows how much movement the market is expecting in the future. Options with high levels of implied volatility suggest that investors in the underlying stocks are expecting a big move in one direction or the other. It could also mean there is an event coming up soon that may cause a big rally or a huge sell-off. However, implied volatility is only one piece of the puzzle when putting together an options trading strategy.What do the Analysts Think?Clearly, options traders are pricing in a big move for AES shares, but what is the fundamental picture for the company? Currently, AES is a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) in the Utility - Electric Power industry that ranks in the Top 32% of our Zacks Industry Rank. Over the last 60 days, one analyst has increased the earnings estimates for the current quarter, while none have dropped their estimates.

215,5b93fa82-5f4b-341e-aaf5-c4ccd32ca388,GM,2022-09-23,3 Stocks in Focus as Domestic Auto Industry Shows Resiliency,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/3-stocks-focus-domestic-auto-133201436.html,1663853521,STORY,"['F', 'PCAR', '^GSPC', 'GM']","[The Zacks Domestic Auto industry, despite being highly cyclical, seems to be holding its ground. Rising interest rates and high inflation are not weighing on the demand for vehicles. While the devasted supply chain system is certainly a pain point and is affecting production volumes, increasing the prices of vehicles is largely offsetting the decline in output. Automakers are passing on the escalating costs of commodities to consumers by way of a hike in model prices. Most importantly, the popularity of electric vehicles (EVs) is soaring each passing day and auto biggies are fast cementing their position in this domain. Industry participants like General Motors GM, Ford F and PACCAR PCAR should be on your radar to fetch handsome long-term returns.Industry OverviewThe Zacks Domestic Auto industry includes companies that are engaged in designing, manufacturing and retailing vehicles across the globe. These include passenger cars, crossover vehicles, sport utility vehicles, trucks, vans, motorcycles and electric vehicles. The industry — which is highly consumer cyclic and provides employment to a large number of people — is at the forefront of innovation, courtesy of its nature and the transformation that it is going through. The widespread usage of technology and rapid digitization are resulting in the fundamental restructuring of the automotive market. Several companies in the industry have engine and transmission plants and conduct research and development and testing of electric and autonomous vehicles.Key Investing Themes Demand Holds Steady Despite Stubborn Inflation: Despite sky-high inflation, rising interest rates and economic slowdown, buyers’ appetite for vehicles has held relatively steady. The top two Detroit auto biggies General Motors and Ford are not seeing signs of softening demand as yet. In fact, in August, new vehicle sales in the United States rose 4.3% year over year and 0.3% from the July level, per Automotive Industry Portal MarkLines.Story continuesSupply Chain Snafu Has Been a Major Sticking Point: Automakers are battling a severe chip crisis aggravated by the Russia-Ukraine war and lockdown restrictions in China. Many auto biggies are temporarily suspending operations and slashing their production targets amid logistical challenges. There are no signs of the easing of chip issues in the near term, which are going to limit automakers’ production volumes. Experts expect the shortage to linger in 2023 as well.Commodity and Operational Cost Headwinds Remain: Prices of raw materials are soaring and are not likely to abate anytime soon. Most automakers have already warned that commodity inflation will remain a major headwind for quite some time. Ford recently announced that its third-quarter profits are likely to take a hit as it expects its cost of auto parts to be $1 billion higher than expected. Additionally, massive R&amp;D expenses for the development of high-tech cars would also likely strain near-term cash flows.High Vehicle Prices Mostly Offsetting Cost Woes: As inventory challenges are mounting amid supply-demand imbalance, the average prices of vehicles (both new and used) are shooting up. As automakers are successfully managing to pass on the burden of escalating input costs to consumers, their revenues have not dwindled yet. With prices going through the roof, many customers are willing to pay a premium for their preferred vehicle. But then, another set of consumers is unwilling to pay a heavy premium and is waiting on the sidelines in the light of high prices and high borrowing rates.Soaring EV Sales Continue to be a Bright Spot: Inclination toward green cars is serving as a key catalyst. Climate change concerns, technological advancement and stringent fuel-emission standards are increasing green vehicles’ adoption. Demand for electric cars is off the charts. For the first half of 2022, around 414,000 EVs were delivered. EV share as a percentage of new cars sold improved to 6% in the first half of 2022 from 3% in the corresponding period of last year. The latest Inflation Reduction Act will fuel EV sales further.Zacks Industry Rank Indicates Decent ProspectsThe Zacks Automotive – Domestic industry is a 22-stock group within the broader Zacks Auto-Tires-Trucks sector. The industry currently carries a Zacks Industry Rank #95, which places it in the top 38% of more than 250 Zacks industries.The group’s Zacks Industry Rank, which is basically the average of the Zacks Rank of all the member stocks, indicates encouraging near-term prospects. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperform the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.The industry’s positioning in the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries is a result of a positive earnings outlook for the constituent companies in aggregate. Looking at the aggregate earnings estimate revisions, it appears that analysts are gaining confidence in this group’s earnings growth potential. The industry’s earnings estimates for 2022 have risen around 6% since Jun 30.Before we present you three industry participants worth considering for your portfolio, let's take a look at the industry’s stock market performance and current valuation.Industry Outperforms S&amp;P 500 &amp; SectorThe Domestic Auto industry has surpassed the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite over the past year. The industry has moved up 1.7% versus the S&amp;P 500 and sector’s decline of 14.6% and 14.9%, respectively, over the said time frame.One-Year Price PerformanceIndustry's Current ValuationSince automotive companies are debt laden, it makes sense to value them based on the EV/EBITDA (Enterprise Value/ Earnings before Interest Tax Depreciation and Amortization) ratio. On the basis of the trailing 12-month enterprise value to EBITDA (EV/EBITDA), the industry is currently trading at 29.34X compared with the S&amp;P 500’s 11.86X and the sector’s 15.82X. Over the past five years, the industry has traded as high as 54.74X, as low as 8.85X and at a median of 15.26X, as the chart below shows.EV/EBITDA Ratio (Past Five Years) 3 Stocks to Add to WatchlistPACCAR: A leading name in the trucking business, PACCAR’s wide range of trucks carries a solid reputation. The launch of Peterbilt 579 and Kenworth T680 along with the new line of DAF trucks in the European Union market with higher fuel efficiencies should boost prospects. PACCAR’s accelerated efforts toward electrification, connected vehicle services and advanced driver-assistance system options augur well. Its Parts and Financial Services segments gain from a broad dealer network. PACCAR’s strong balance sheet is complemented by A+ and A1 credit ratings assigned by Standard &amp; Poor's and Moody's, respectively.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for PACCAR’s 2022 earnings and sales implies year-over-year growth of 45.3% and 22%, respectively. The consensus mark for 2022 earnings has moved north by 7.8% over the past 60 days. PACCAR currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) and has a VGM Score of B.  You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 (Strong Buy) Rank stocks here. Price and Consensus: PCARGeneral Motors: One of the world’s largest automakers, General Motors’ U.S. market share was 14.4% of the industry’s total sales in 2021.U.S. legacy automaker General Motors’ prospects shine bright, courtesy of its hot-selling brands in America like Chevrolet Silverado, Equinox and GMC Sierra. GM’s big push toward EVs is commendable. The automaker plans to roll out 30 fresh EV models by 2025-end.  Key launches, including the GMC Hummer EV, Cadillac Lyriq crossover EV, Equinox EV, Silverdo EV and Blazer EV, among others, are expected to buoy top-line growth. General Motors has enough cash on the balance sheet to weather short-term headwinds and navigate economic cycles.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for GM’s 2022 and 2023 sales implies year-over-year growth of 21.5% and 6.5%, respectively. Over the trailing four quarters, the company surpassed earnings estimates thrice and missed once, the average surprise being 18.9%. General Motors currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) and has a VGM Score of A.Price and Consensus: GMFord: The U.S. auto giant’s prospects are getting bolstered by a strong vehicle mix, supported by F-series trucks, Maverick pickup and SUV models, including Escape, Explorer, Expedition, EcoSport and Edge, which is impressive. With Mustang Mach-E, E-Transit and F-150 Lightning, the robust BEV lineup would further aid deliveries. The Ford+ plan, with a deep focus on increasing profitability, exploring the e-mobility future and enhancing customer experience, sparks optimism. Ford’s ambitious rejig plan to split its EV business into a separate unit within the company will unlock growth opportunities. The company’s improving financials provide a solid foundation for investment in Ford+ priorities.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Ford’s 2022 earnings and sales implies year-over-year growth of 32% and 16%, respectively. The consensus mark for 2022 earnings has moved 10.6% north over the past 60 days. Ford currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 and has a VGM Score of B.Price and Consensus: FWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

216,d2de20a2-d8e5-3ac7-84d6-e084aee8d417,GM,2022-09-23,General Motors (GM) & Hertz Partner for Massive Supply of EVs,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/general-motors-gm-hertz-partner-123012040.html,1663849812,STORY,"['GM', 'HTZ', 'LEA']","[In a conscious move toward sustainable mobility, General Motors GM and Hertz Global HTZ recently formed an agreement, per which the former will sell nearly 175,000 of its EVs to the latter.The automaker will start supplying Chevrolet, Buick, GMC, Cadillac and even its commercial delivery unit, BrightDrop EVs, to the global vehicle rental giant from the first quarter of next year and over the next five years.These vehicles are expected to be followed by newer EV models built on GM’s Ultium battery technology, such as the Chevrolet Blazer, Chevrolet Equinox and vehicles from its other brands.Over the five years through 2027, Hertz has projected that its customers could travel more than 8 billion miles in the EVs, cutting down nearly 3.5 million metric tons of carbon dioxide emissions compared to similar gasoline-powered vehicles that travel long distances.The extensive upcoming EV lineup by GM that includes everything from SUVs to pickup trucks and luxury vehicles will be made available to Hertz for rent. BrightDrop will make its Zevo 600 van available.Both GM and Hertz are of the view that the plan is the largest expansion drive of EVs among fleet customers because it includes a wide range of vehicle categories across varied price points, thereby making it more popular. General Motors, through the move, ensures that the EV market footprint widens and more customers can partake in the benefits of cleaner transport.Hertz is focusing on electrifying its vehicle fleet after spinning back from bankruptcy less than a year ago. The coronavirus pandemic badly hurt the company, but once travel eased up, pent-up demand resulted in higher profits for rental car fleets, despite the supply-chain issues denting inventory levels.To be quickly back in the grind, last year, it purchased 100,000 Model 3 vehicles from Tesla TSLA and hogged the limelight for this bold step. The immense scale of the deal rolled eyes at the time since such a move by a rental company was unheard of. In May this year, it added Model Y vehicles to its fleet.Apart from Tesla and General Motors, Hertz previously struck a similar agreement with Polestar, a Volvo-backed EV startup, for the supply of 65,000 vehicles. Of the three partnerships so far, the one with GM is the biggest. Hertz has set itself a goal to create the largest rental fleet of EVs in North America, with an enormous number of EVs available for rent at 500 Hertz locations spanning 38 states. Currently, it aims for one-quarter of its fleet to be electric by the end of 2024.General Motors has been long in the EV domain, although it has not been able to match the levels of the EV giant Tesla as it had initially thought. To rev up its electrification drive, it has laid out an ambitious two-year milestone to scale up capacity between 2023 and 2025. It intends to reach a production volume of 1 million EVs in North America and China each by 2025. To ensure that it remains on the trajectory, General Motors is intensively expanding its electrification drive with the planned ramp-up of EV production and EV battery charging networks.In a major development, recently the company announced that it is set to invest $491 million at its Marion Stamping plant to prepare the facility for manufacturing steel and aluminum stamped parts for future vehicles, including electric cars made at various GM assembly plants. The capital outlay will be used to buy and install two new press lines and complete press and die upgrades and renovations. It will also construct a 6,000-square-foot addition. The investment will strengthen GM’s North America division and ensure mass EV production.GM deliveries to Hertz are expected to be carried out smoothly, driven by the opening of GM Ultium Cells battery cell plants in Ohio, Tennessee and Michigan. Also, some while ago, the company inked a deal with Lear Corporation LEA to bolster the Ultium EV platform. Lear will supply electrification technologies for GM’s celebrated platform. With Ultium Drive playing a pivotal role in GM’s EV ambitions, the latest agreement with Lear for the supply of e-mobility technologies for its hardware platform bodes well.General Motors has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) currently. Its shares have lost 27.4% in the past year against its industry’s 1.8% rise.Story continuesZacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Pilots at Horizon Air, the wholly-owned subsidiary of Alaska Air Group ALK, ratified an agreement aimed primarily at retaining skilled pilots.Recap of the Latest Top Stories1 JetBlue, currently carrying a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), expects revenue per available seat mile (RPMs: a measure of air traffic) for the September quarter to increase in the 22-24% band from the third-quarter 2019 actuals (earlier guidance: increase in the 19-23% range). Owing to a strong completion factor (% of scheduled flights that are completed) and improved reliability, JBLU’s capacity guidance for the September quarter is better than the earlier expectation. JetBlue now expects available seat miles (a measure of capacity) to vary from (0.5%) to 0.5% (earlier guidance: flat with or decrease up to 3% from third-quarter 2019 actuals).You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.2. Per a Reuters report, United Airlines canceled 25 Boeing 777-200 airplanes from service this week because of failure to complete the required inspections on the wing leading-edge panels. UAL had already reported the issue to the Federal Aviation Administration through an internal audit, after which it was planned to conduct the inspections.The airline completed inspecting 10 aircraft and is coordinating with the FAA to complete the remaining. We remind investors that United Airlines’ Boeing 777 jets, powered by Pratt &amp; Whitney 4000 engines, had been grounded after a Honolulu-bound flight suffered an engine failure in February 2021 and made an emergency landing at the Denver International Airport following an explosion of the engine debris that rained on Denver suburbs. However, no one suffered injuries and the aircraft landed safely..3. The 700 plus pilots at Horizon Air, represented by the International Brotherhood of Teamsters (IBT), voted to ratify a new agreement. The new deal covers provisions related to pay-hikes and retirement benefits among other facilities.  Joe Sprague, president of Horizon Air, stated, ""We are focused on making Horizon the regional carrier of choice for pilots, and this agreement positions us well. I'm grateful to our pilots and to our colleagues at the IBT for their collaboration and hard work in getting to this point. Together, we are positioning Horizon for a strong future.""Story continues4. Azul announced that it has taken delivery of its first Airbus 350 jet. The plane can accommodate 334 customers. It consumes 20% less fuel per seat. The jet will now aim at completing the certification procedure from the Brazilian regulation agencies. Azul aims to operate two new generation Airbus A350 jets by year-end. They will replace two older generation A330CEO jets.

Today testifying before the Senate Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs. Republicans pressing the CEOs on ESG investments, and of course, the state of the economy. Dimon asked about where inflation, currently at a 40-year high, is headed in the months to come.JAMIE DIMON: Future, not that far away, you have QT, rising rates, more inflation, war in Ukraine, which is deteriorating, oil prices, which I still think are kind of precarious, and yeah, those things have the potential to put the country and the world into a recession, which will obviously help inflation, but is not the preferred way to get there. So the worst outcome is stagflation. So concrete inflation is a very important thing to do.DAVE BRIGGS: Senator Elizabeth Warren, meanwhile, at a passionate back and forth with diamond about fraudulent Zelle transactions, prompting Dimon to quote, ""deeply apologize"" for not giving the numbers the senator asked for.Now, Pat Toomey, in his opening statement, saying, quote, ""I can't help but observe that when banks do weigh in on highly charged social and political issues, they seem to always come down on the liberal side.""

She also notes that the bank is committed to earning that trust and loyalty through broadened support for its Spanish-speaking customers.PNC’s acquisition of BBVA USA in 2021 also expanded the bank’s footprint to the three states with the largest Latino populations – California, Texas and Florida.1Melendez-Valencia, who has been in the financial industry for more than 26 years, has led the Laredo market for 14 years and the Texas Gulf Coast region for about a year under BBVA USA before joining PNC as regional president. She says understanding the needs of the fast-growing Latino population is key for the banking industry.The banking leader shares her thoughts on how best to serve Spanish-speaking communities, how to help members of Latino communities build wealth and why cultivating talent from the communities they serve is important to financial institutions.What led you to a career in banking?I grew up the daughter of two Mexican immigrants who settled in Texas, and I watched my parents start from humble beginnings as small business owners. They have been in business for over 50 years now. As the first person in my family to graduate from college, I wanted to break the mold, earn a college degree and make my family proud. I had dreams of living in a big city and working for a big company, and I loved numbers. So, banking seemed to be the path for me. I get to help customers with their financial needs and at the same time get to know them personally and their businesses – all types of industries.Story continuesWhat banking challenges are impacting Latino communities?There is a range of support that members of Latino communities need from financial institutions like PNC. First, the needs for individuals on the Texas Border are quite different from those in Florida or California, the same way the needs of Salvadorans are different from that of Mexicans, Cubans, Venezuelans and other members of Latino communities. This is why the PNC Bank model of building client relationships is important to serving Latino communities. We understand specific needs. You have small business owners like my parents, global businesses that require international private banking and individuals who require wealth management.Second, I see the need for more bankers and financial planners who speak Spanish. Less than 5% of certified financial planners are Black or Latino. Latinos alone make up 19% of the U.S. population. When you compare those numbers, there is a huge gap.However, on the other end of the spectrum, there is still a large Latino population that is underserved, and I think it has to do with a lack of knowledge about the services available to them. So, financial education is key to helping them learn how financial products and services can help them achieve their life goals. And when I say financial education, I mean everything from helping potential customers understand what a checking account is to understanding how a financial planner may be able to assist you with retirement goals.And how is PNC meeting those challenges?There have been instances where some Latinos have come from a country where the banking system has failed them – their life savings disappeared overnight. That can be devastating and cause a lack of trust in financial systems as a whole.Trust and loyalty are two of the most important qualities that Latinos desire, and one of the best ways to build that trust is to engage with them in their native language. This goes beyond advertising in Spanish. PNC established a Spanish language customer call center in 2001 has broadened its support over time. And we have Spanish-speaking staff in our branches and even our mobile branch units. We still have more work to do in this space, but it’s a start.What also creates loyalty with Latinos is seeing companies invest in the communities in which they work and live, and I think PNC does a good job of that through philanthropy,sponsorships and its Main Street banking approach.Through the Office of the Regional President, we get to make local decisions about what is important to our communities. For example, I live in the border city of Laredo, Texas where 95% of the population speaks Spanish. Everything we are doing here, in one way or another, is helping the Latino community, and we are doing this on a much larger scale than we did previously. This is helping us elevate the PNC brand within Latino communities and everyone along the Texas Border.We have a lender here in Laredo who dedicates his time on Saturdays to teaching PNC financial education classes about mortgage lending to first-time homebuyers. Over the years, we have either sponsored or given grants toward economic development, arts and culture projects and programs that support educational opportunities for children in communities all along the Texas border.Why is it important to cultivate Latino talent at PNC?I believe as Latino leaders at PNC, we have an opportunity to use our collective voices to not only improve our own circumstances but also drive the accountability of change throughout organizations.It’s important to recruit, improve retention and increase opportunities for talented leaders within Latino employee populations. I am very excited to be one of the four executive sponsors of PNC Unidos, which is the first Hispanic and Latino leader forum within PNC. I think now is the perfect time to start a leaders’ forum like this given the number of Latino employees PNC has gained from the acquisition of BBVA USA. I also think that we as Latino leaders have a huge opportunity to help grow the Hispanic business segment within PNC.We are the second-largest racial or ethnic group in the United States, and it is projected that by 2060 there will be more than 111 million Latinos in this country.5 We have a huge growth opportunity in front of us, and I think with the right financial education, along with building trust and loyalty, we can really help Latino communities. https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2021/09/09/key-facts-about-u-s-latinos-for-national-hispanic-heritage-month/https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2022/02/03/u-s-hispanic-population-continued-its-geographic-spread-in-the-2010s/https://www.cfp.net/news/2022/01/cfp-board-surpasses-92000-cfp-professionals-increases-gender-and-racial-diversity-ofhttps://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2022/02/03/u-s-hispanic-population-continued-its-geographic-spread-in-the-2010s/https://www.census.gov/library/visualizations/2018/comm/hispanic-projected-pop.htmlView additional multimedia and more ESG storytelling from PNC Financial Services Group on 3blmedia.comView source version on newsdirect.com: https://newsdirect.com/news/building-better-trust-and-loyalty-in-latino-communities-896558967]"

That's according to a new survey out of Stifel on consumer spending. Joining us now to add some insight is Stifel's managing director for the consumer and retail sector. That is Mark Astrachan.Good to see you, Mark. Thanks for being here. I want to start with some of these hiring plans before we really dig into the meat of the survey, which was very interesting. Target saying it's going to hire 100,000 folks. Walmart only 40,000. I mean, what can we, if anything, read into some of these plans?MARK ASTRACHAN: Yeah, thanks. Thanks for having me, first off. I think it's probably a little bit hard to read into the plans specifically because you just don't know necessarily what the hiring levels are behind those. But I think generally speaking, it's encouraging to see at least that they're looking to hire folks and that they're actually finding folks to actually hire because if you recall over the last year or so, it's been just a lot harder to find people to come into those jobs, given where unemployment is.And so I think they're basically trying to get what they can. I think probably the fact the numbers aren't exceedingly above where they've been in the last couple of years would suggest that they're probably in a pretty good spot at this point to be able to service the customer adequately.And just as an aside, but I think interesting, too, remember, a lot of the folks that they're hiring are not just doing kind of front of store, but they're also doing things behind the scenes to fulfill digital orders as well, like buy online, pickup in store, buy online, pickup in parking lot as an example. So you do need more folks than you did five years ago, but I think they're probably in a decent spot at this point.Story continuesBRAD SMITH: What does that tell you, though, about some of their margin compression, perhaps, what they're expecting, based on the hiring levels that they have set forth and because they are so dramatically different from last year?MARK ASTRACHAN: Well, I guess it's going to depend. Walmart's up 40,000, Target up 100,000. But again, kind of similar to the prior year and Walmart below. So I guess, on a net basis, that's probably better if you have fewer people versus the prior year. But this year, the margins are not just hiring of people. Of course, there's all the inflation overlying everything else that's going on. And so all these companies have just seen a massive pressure on cost.On top of that, the slowing of general merchandise discretionary, however you want to put it, category sales. In the fiscal second quarter, kind of May, June time frame, that obviously weighed on margins there. So the expectation would be that things get better from a margin standpoint relative to where the lows were earlier in the year. So not necessarily a comment on the year on year in the holiday period, but certainly better than where we were in the July quarter, for example.JULIE HYMAN: Yeah, and speaking of which as well, when we look at your spending survey, people in terms of their spending intentions, net discretionary spending intentions, you guys found, were up 10% in mid-September. That compares to about a 6% increase since June.And I guess you can account for some of that with the lower gasoline prices. I mean, how do you tease out these spending intentions and account for higher prices as a part of that? In other words, if you ask someone how much more do you expect to spend, how much of their answer depends on how much more they're going to have-- do they think they're going to have to spend on the same stuff?MARK ASTRACHAN: Yeah, it's a good question. It's not really one of those things that we get into a lot of specifics in asking folks what they think about the inflationary aspect of what they're spending relative to what they're actually spending. But inherent in that, obviously, is at least some level of inflationary pressure that goes into it. But I think, really, the high level just suggests that the consumer, regardless of what we're seeing and debating from a market and macro standpoint, that the consumer is actually feeling a little bit more robust or less influenced by kind of some of those higher level items.And to your point, I think the gas prices, it's really hard to kind of overstate what the impact was on higher prices in early June and, obviously, lower prices on a relative basis from there. And we asked the question on just how much impact you're seeing from gas prices on spending. And it's still inflated relative to historical levels. 60% of our respondents say that they're expecting some impact from their spending on gas prices, but that's down 10 points from where we were in June.And obviously, gas prices are down materially since June, still up about, I think, 15% or so year on year. So I think that's kind of what you're seeing here in terms of the overall spending. The lower gas prices really is helping the consumer kind of thinking about that.And the holiday spending kind of coupled with asking on back to school spending that we started in, I think, late July or early August, show that you're actually seeing two improving spending intentions on just back to school, but also on holiday, that those levels in terms of where back to school spending ended, which was down a couple of points versus a year ago, is much better than down high single digits, where we were in early August when we started asking that question.So I think you're kind of seeing the consumer spending appetite increases. Gas prices, in particular, come down. And then they're just dealing with inflation as they can. But there's not a lot you can do.BRAD SMITH: What type of divide in that spending and tension are you seeing among different income brackets, perhaps, and especially as we've seen a relative resiliency in some of the higher income spenders versus the rest of the market, the rest of the economy, and consumers that are trying to exactly determine where they can still spend on discretionary things versus kind of pulling it back in entirety. And is that starting to trickle into the higher income brackets as well?MARK ASTRACHAN: Yeah, it's actually really, really fascinating. So we take the income levels and kind of look at those questions that we ask-- a lot of the questions, but the very high level of spending, the high level of back to school and holiday. And what's really fascinating is, it's been ongoing for a while that those earning less than 75,000 per year have in absolute terms said they're going to spend less on a year on year basis. And that got worse as we went through spring and early summer, peaked or troughed in June from higher gas prices and has gotten better.So if you take a look at the most recent survey, those consumers, again, those earning less than 75,000 per year, say they're going to spend 17% less versus a year ago versus the overall 10% number that you said. So it obviously tells you how significantly up the spending intentions are for those earning more than that.And if you take a look at the back to school and holiday, the same dynamics play out where those earning less than 75,000 are going to spend less. But interestingly, holiday spending intentions were actually higher relative to overall spending in each income level, including those lower income consumers.So suggesting that the lower income consumers are going to spend less year on year, but they're actually spending less than just the overall-- or I should say, they're spending more than the overall discretionary spending. So they're still planning on spending more just in absolute terms on holiday. So somewhat encouraging there.And I'll just add, too, that if you look at that under 75,000 level that's, as I said, gotten better since June, I think that's probably the important takeaway here that that lower income consumer is feeling a little less pressure right now because the gas prices are.JULIE HYMAN: Where are all these people going to spend their money, Mark? Just real quickly, what's your pick going into the holiday season?MARK ASTRACHAN: I'm not sure I have one. But I think maybe broader strokes here, kind of punting the question, discretionary spending has obviously been pretty weak in the first part of this year. And so I think you're going to see that those categories that were most weak probably come back a little bit more as we head into holiday.BRAD SMITH: Stifel managing director Mark Astrachan joining us here today. Thanks so much for the survey, the insights, and breaking this down for us. Appreciate it.]"

227,2e0f6e46-bee0-33ec-a0cb-4b598e73db31,CSX,2022-09-23,3 Railroad Stocks to Buy Now That Strike Fears Have Left the Station,InvestorPlace,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/3-railroad-stocks-buy-now-011632891.html,1663636592,STORY,"['WAB', 'CSX', 'TRN']","[Last week, a tentative deal was announced between unions and the railroad companies averting a national strike that could have seen 125,000 railroad workers go on strike. It also avoided a major economic disruption at a time when a recession remains a real possibility. Since the announcement of the deal on the morning of Sept. 15, railroad stocks are generally lower.Part of the reason for investor apathy around railroad stocks may be that the White House-brokered deal could still fall apart if one of the 12 unions involved fails to ratify a new contract. Essential details in the agreement have yet to be ironed out. Some union leaders feel the agreement’s language was intentionally vague so as not to back the railroads into a corner on various issues such as sick leave and unsafe working conditions. However, as a rule, railroad stocks tend to be good long-term investments. Berkshire Hathaway’s (NYSE:BRK-B) $26.7 billion purchase of Burlington Northern Santa Fe railroad in February 2010 has certainly proven prosperous. In a 2021 annual letter to Berkshire Hathaway shareholders, Warren Buffett referred to the railroad as Berkshire’s second most valuable asset.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsIf you’re looking to bet on railroad stocks but worried about the agreement falling through, options are an excellent way to get in on the action without making too much of a financial commitment. Here are the three railroad stocks I would consider and the appropriate options to make it happen.CSXCSX$29.88WABWestinghouse Air Brake Technologies$88.76TRNTrinity Industries$23.38CSX (CSX)Source: Wangkun Jia / Shutterstock.comThe Florida-based railroad has rail service up and down the East Coast and Midwest. In 2021, CSX’s (NASDAQ:CSX) 10 largest yards and terminals processed 5.9 million railcars or intermodal containers. Its three largest are in Waycross, Ga., Chicago, and Indianapolis. The railroad’s four major transportation networks are the Interstate 90 Corridor between Chicago and New York, the Interstate 95 Corridor between Chicago and Florida, the Southeastern Corridor between Chicago and Atlanta, and its Coal Network, which services all of the major coal producers in the Southeast, Mid-Atlantic and Northeast. At the end of 2021, CSX owned or had long-term leases on 65,180 freight cars and intermodal containers with approximately 87% in service.   Story continuesOn Sept. 15, CSX announced a management changeup. Current CEO James M. Foote will retire on Sept. 26, after almost five years in the top job. He’ll remain an advisor until March 31, 2023, to help with the transition. Joseph R. Hinrichs, the former president of Ford’s (NYSE:F) automotive business, is joining the company as the new CEO.  Analysts are generally optimistic about CSX stock. Of the 28 covering it, 19 rate it “overweight” or “buy.” Only one rates it a “sell.” The average target price of $35.68 is 19.4% higher than the current share price.The call option I would consider is the Oct. 21 $32.50 contract, which currently costs 28 cents to buy. So, the breakeven is $32.78 and you’ve got approximately one month to see its share price increase by 9.7% or more in that time.    Westinghouse Air Brake Technologies (WAB)Westinghouse Air Brake Technologies Corporation (Wabtec) logo on a phone screen in front of the Wabtec website. WAB stock.Source: T. Schneider / ShutterstockWabtec, short for Westinghouse Air Brake Technologies (NYSE:WAB), is the first of two railroad-related stocks. The company makes equipment and components for railroad locomotives, freight cars, subway cars, buses and mining equipment. For an idea of the type of products Wabtec provides the railroad industry, take a look at the company’s recent announcement regarding an order from Hitachi Rail. Hitachi is building monorail stations for Panama’s L3 monorail. The order was for 300 half-height platform screen doors. Wabtec is a global leader in these platform screen doors, which are used to keep passengers or objects from falling on the tracks. The company installed the world’s first platform screen doors in Hong Kong in 2002 and recently equipped the Copenhagen metro with them.The company finished the second quarter with a total backlog of $23.23 billion, up 7.9% from a year earlier. Over the past 12 months, it added $6.57 billion in backlog, up 12.8%.Analysts are lukewarm on WAB stock. Eight of the 15 covering it give it an “overweight” or “buy” rating. The average target price of $103.42 is 16.5% higher than the current share price. The Oct. 21 $100 call contract looks interesting. The ask is just 30 cents, so the breakeven would be only 13% higher than where shares trade today. You’re out $30 per contract if they don’t get there.    Trinity Industries (TRN)a digital representation of transportation with cargo in the background and a business person in the foreground analyzing something on a tabletSource: ShutterstockTrinity Industries (NYSE:TRN) is a company whose stock has performed poorly for long-time shareholders. It is up just 7.5% over the past five years compared with a 55% advance for the S&amp;P 500. I recommended the stock as a “buy” back in early 2016 because its share price had been hit hard by lower railcar demand. Ultimately, the demand would return, and Trinity’s railcar revenues would return to historical norms. The rest of its business — construction products, inland barges, energy equipment, and railcar leasing and management — were generating 30% operating profit. However, the other businesses have mostly been sold off in the ensuing years. In early January, Trinity sold its highway products business to a private equity firm for $375 million. It used $250 million of the proceeds to buy back stock held by activist investor ValueAct Capital, which first took a stake in July 2016. It repurchased 8.78 million shares at $28.49 a share, well above the current price. That reduced ValueAct’s ownership to 4.4%. As of June 30, ValueAct held just 90,847 shares.In 2018, Trinity spun off its infrastructure and barge business into a separate publicly traded company. Investors got one share of Arcosa (NYSE:ACA) for every three shares held in Trinity, providing added value for longtime TRN shareholders. After these two moves, the company was left to focus on its railcar manufacturing, leasing and management-related services. In the first six months of the year, revenue rose 43% from a year ago to $889.5 million, while its operating profit was up nearly 17% to $127.8 million. Its backlog at the end of the second quarter was $2.2 billion, up 86% from a year earlier.The call option I’d consider is the Oct. 21 $25 contract. It’s got a 40-cent ask price for a breakeven of $25.40, just 8.6% higher than its current share price.On the date of publication, Will Ashworth did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

Now they're on track to have, quote, ""all quarters of 2023"" booked within historical ranges at record prices, with bookings accelerating every week. They're also outpacing 2019 levels. Now, they say that customer deposits are at record levels. And over 90% of bookings made in the second quarter were new.Now, of course, we saw bookings tick up after easing those COVID-19 vaccination and testing requirements on most itineraries last month. And they also cite demographics in their favor. They're talking about COVID leading to that. Of course, higher number of retirees than usual. You have millennials hitting their economic stride. And of course, workers having more flexible work schedules, which they hope will boost cruise travel.But of course, inflation concerns still hang over the industry. You see their year to date, though, down about 38%. Royal Caribbean said it's also tapping the bond market, though, looking to raise $2 billion to refinance debt that's due next year, making at least a dent in its $21 billion debt load, Seana.SEANA SMITH: Yeah, Rachelle, the bookings, that's really interesting here, outpacing 2019 levels. I think we've been asking ourselves for the past two years how long it's going to take for the cruise industry to get back to those pre-pandemic levels. So the fact that they are already seeing that happen, I think, is very encouraging here. It's encouraging here in terms of the investor story.Now, how the analysts are looking at it, 10 analysts have buys on the stock. The average price target out there, $62. That's about a 30% upside from where the stock is currently trading at $47.39. So at least from the Street's perspective, they think Royal Caribbean, majority of the analysts that cover the stock, think it has some room to run.]"

236,aee49f5e-de69-35a0-b8a0-82a1be787c04,ADI,2022-09-23,"Is Trending Stock Analog Devices, Inc. (ADI) a Buy Now?",Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/trending-stock-analog-devices-inc-130001335.html,1663851601,STORY,['ADI'],"[Analog Devices (ADI) has recently been on Zacks.com's list of the most searched stocks. Therefore, you might want to consider some of the key factors that could influence the stock's performance in the near future.Over the past month, shares of this semiconductor maker have returned -9.3%, compared to the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's -10.2% change. During this period, the Zacks Semiconductor - Analog and Mixed industry, which Analog Devices falls in, has lost 11.4%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?While media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.Revisions to Earnings EstimatesRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.We essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.For the current quarter, Analog Devices is expected to post earnings of $2.58 per share, indicating a change of +49.1% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed +0.3% over the last 30 days.For the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $9.42 points to a change of +45.8% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has changed +0.1%.Story continuesFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $9.54 indicates a change of +1.2% from what Analog Devices is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has remained unchanged.With an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for Analog Devices.The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPS12-month consensus EPS estimate for ADI _12MonthEPSChartUrlProjected Revenue GrowthEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.For Analog Devices, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $3.16 billion indicates a year-over-year change of +35.1%. For the current and next fiscal years, $11.93 billion and $12.34 billion estimates indicate +63% and +3.4% changes, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryAnalog Devices reported revenues of $3.11 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +76.8%. EPS of $2.52 for the same period compares with $1.72 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $3.06 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +1.71%. The EPS surprise was +3.7%.The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.ValuationNo investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.While comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.As part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.Analog Devices is graded C on this front, indicating that it is trading at par with its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.Bottom LineThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Analog Devices. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Get the Morning Brief sent directly to your inbox every Monday to Friday by 6:30 a.m. ET. SubscribeSeptember 23, 2022Today's newsletter is by Julie Hyman, anchor and correspondent at Yahoo Finance. Follow Julie on Twitter @juleshyman.Who else is sick of talking about the Fed? Of course, the Federal Reserve and its battle against inflation using higher interest rates is vitally important. But I need a break.So, on to another crucial question: Are zero-commission brokerages ripping you off?The Securities and Exchange Commission is apparently deciding they are not — or at least that the SEC isn't going to do anything about it even if they are. Bloomberg reports the agency has decided not to ban payment for order flow, known as PFOF. That’s a practice in which brokerages process customers’ trades through wholesalers, in a way that critics say saddle individual traders with hidden fees.The argument against PFOF is that the practice poses a conflict because, in theory, brokerages should be aiming to make money for their customers — not market makers like Citadel Securities. In reality, it's tough to find many in favor of an all-out ban on PFOF aside from meme stock aficionados who populate Twitter and Reddit. Rather than banning PFOF, the SEC would be wise to focus on price transparency and requiring brokers to execute trades at the best price possible at the time.“The SEC does not have to ban payment for order flow or other specific anti-investor, conflict-ridden market practices if it requires best execution to be the best available price at the time given order characteristics and market conditions,"" Dennis Kelleher, head of investor advocacy group Better Markets, told Yahoo Finance in an email. ""If it does that, the SEC won’t have to play whack-a-mole with an industry that is relentless in creating new wealth extraction practices that avoid yesterday’s rules and require new rules tomorrow.""Story continuesA crucial revenue stream for commission-free brokeragesIn a PFOF model, a commission-free brokerage like Robinhood or Schwab processes an investor’s order for a stock purchase and passes it on to a wholesaler, like Citadel Securities or Virtu Americas. These market makers then execute the transaction and pay brokerage firms for routing the trade through them.When the market maker can purchase a stock at a lower price than the customer asked for, the brokerage and the market maker split the savings. The money pocketed by the brokerages, the ""payment for order flow,"" can finance its commission-free business.Robinhood Markets, Inc. CEO and co-founder Vlad Tenev arrives on Wall Street after the company's IPO in New York City, U.S., July 29, 2021. REUTERS/Andrew KellyThis an important revenue stream for Robinhood, which popularized the practice in 2020 when US households were flush with stimulus checks and ready to play the market. Since then, trading on Robinhood has declined — along with its stock price — and it has tried to diversify revenue streams.According to analyst Devin Ryan of JMP Securities, PFOF made up 9% of Robinhood's equities revenue last quarter, 36% of options revenue, and 18% of crypto revenue. Shares of the company surged on the report that the SEC wasn’t planning to institute a ban. However, then Robinhood then erased that gain and closed down 2.72% at $9.65 a share — far less than this time last year, when it was trading for five time as much.Still, it's clear the Bloomberg report on the SEC's decision regarding PFOF is good for Robinhood. Is that gain coming at the expense of small investors?Trading firms, predictably, think there’s no issue with the current system, and argue that retail traders already get good prices. SEC Chair Gary Gensler has largely taken the other side, saying in June that payment for order flow “can distort routing decisions.”However, experts argue that eliminating PFOF would attack the wrong issue. The problem, according to one recent study by several business school professors, is the wildly different prices retail investors can pay depending on which market maker routes their orders. That study found that differences among brokerage platforms and where an order is routed can cost small investors up to $34 billion a year.Watch: How does payment for order flow work?The solution to that problem isn't to get rid of PFOF, according to Christopher Schwarz, a professor at the University of California Irvine, who co-authored that study. Instead, he said, brokerages should be more transparent about prices.The debate over banning PFOF “is the shiny thing in the room that is distracting everyone from the issue of market centers giving very different execution to different brokers. And that execution is not related to PFOF,"" Schwarz wrote Yahoo Finance on Thursday.Jared Dillian, editor and publisher of the Daily Dirtnap and investment strategist at Mauldin Economics, argued last month for Bloomberg Opinion that regulation of PFOF could backfire.""The US has the deepest, most liquid capital markets in the world, but we might not if regulators start getting too involved,"" he wrote. ""As long as competition exists, things will get better and trading costs will come down even further.”Undoubtedly, many on Wall Street agree with Dillian, and papers like those from Schwarz may have swayed the SEC to look at the issue differently. Of course, the agency might end up banning PFOF or restricting it. In the meantime, it's tough to say whether investors are mad at PFOF or just wary of the market these days.The number of people trading via Robinhood has fallen this year, to 14 million monthly transacting users by June 2022 from 17.3 million last December. As Robinhood's user base has shrink, alternatives have cropped up — including Public.com, which is commission-free, doesn’t offer payment for order flow, and allows users instead to offer a tip to brokers that execute their trades. The company says its users grew from 1 million in mid-2021 to 3 million in early 2022.Ultimately, PFOF might fall out of favor, regardless of whether the SEC steps in to police the practice.What to Watch TodayEconomic calendar9:45 a.m. ET: S&amp;P Global U.S. Manufacturing PMI, September Preliminary (51.1 expected, 51.5 during prior month)9:45 a.m. ET: S&amp;P Global U.S. Services PMI, September Preliminary (45.0 expected, 43.7 during prior month)9:45 a.m. ET: S&amp;P Global U.S. Manufacturing PMI, September Preliminary (46.0 expected, 44.6 during prior month)EarningsCarnival (CCL)Yahoo Finance HighlightsSalesforce stock could double in value, Goldman analyst saysWhat rising auto loan delinquencies tell us about the economyJamie Dimon calls crypto tokens 'decentralized Ponzi schemes'—Click here for the latest stock market news and in-depth analysis, including events that move stocksRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo FinanceDownload the Yahoo Finance app for Apple or AndroidFollow Yahoo Finance on Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, Flipboard, LinkedIn, and YouTube]"

The regulator had mulled over the controversial practice for months that critics believe creates conflicts of interest. (https://bit.ly/3LwinJn)Retail brokers route most customer orders via wholesale brokers than exchanges, as wholesalers generally offer a slightly better price. Most retail brokers also accept rebates, or payments, from wholesalers in lieu of orders.Shares of Robinhood Markets Inc, which makes around 75% of its revenue from PFOF, climbed 5%, while Virtu Financial added 9%.PFOF drew new scrutiny last year when an army of retail investors went on a buying spree of ""meme stocks"" like GameStop and AMC, squeezing hedge funds that had shorted the shares.Many investors had purchased the shares using commission-free brokers like Robinhood that accept PFOF from a few powerful market-makers.Britain, Canada, and Australia have already banned PFOF, while SEC Chairman Gary Gensler had suggested in August that the regulator could go that route.Chair Gensler said in his recent Congressional testimony that he believes it's appropriate to look at ways to freshen up the SEC's rules to make equity markets fair, efficient, and competitive as possible for investors, particularly for retail investors, said an SEC spokesperson.To that end, recommendations about best execution, fees and rebates, payment for order flow and order-by-order competition are few of the things being considered, the spokesperson added.

It recently unveiled a technology-led center in the United Kingdom that showcases the benefits of next-generation connectivity and aids healthcare professionals in delivering urgent and emergency care to virtual wards to in-person care and rehabilitation centers across the globe.The collaboration intends to connect frontline responders to specialist doctors during critical emergencies and enable access to superior healthcare facilities.

The company’s 5G network hinges on three fundamental drivers to deliver the full potential of next-generation wireless technology. These are massive spectrum holdings, particularly in the millimeter-wave bands for faster data transfer, end-to-end deep fiber resources and the ability to deploy a large number of small cells.

The design will allow military leaders to leverage the high-speed, high-bandwidth and low-latency of Verizon 5G, providing on-base personnel with the ability to explore how enhanced wireless coverage can help increase operational efficiencies.   “Verizon Public Sector is proud of its partnership with the U.S. Armed Forces and excited about the digital transformation work already underway in a selected test area at Joint Base Pearl Harbor Hickam,” said Maggie Hallbach, senior vice president for Public Sector at Verizon. “The private 5G network we’re constructing in an aircraft maintenance hangar at JBPHH is just the latest example of how we're helping the U.S. Department of Defense deliver innovative, mission-critical capabilities across a range of military operations through advanced network and communications solutions.""Ericsson will serve as a partner to Verizon on the Tranche 2 award work, bringing their Ericsson Private 5G solution which offers a core and radio access network to the test site.""We're continuing to push technological advancements with our long-standing partner Verizon to deliver on their 5G ambitions, and today’s announcement demonstrates our commitment to exploring the vast applications and opportunities that can be built upon next-generation networks,"" said Graham Osborne, Vice President and Head of Customer Unit Verizon, Ericsson North America.As part of the pilot network design on JBPHH, which includes a hangar and other nearby areas, a limited number of aircraft maintenance personnel will explore new ways to implement Foreign Object Detection (FOD), other airplane maintenance applications and several different user equipment (UE) devices to see how they perform on the private network.

Verizon is the first corporate drone program to achieve the IS-BAO registration for its drone operations and only the second drone operator in the U.S. to receive the registration. The independent audit validates the high safety and governance standards of Verizon’s drone program and provides the opportunity to expand future drone operations into more complex areas, such as flights beyond visual line of sight.Verizon utilizes drones across several critical business functions, including extensive support of its network. Since the program’s inception in 2017, there have been more than 17,000 flights that total over 4,000 flight hours. Verizon’s drones fly in every season to perform network testing and performance monitoring. The drones collect imaging in conjunction with software that creates 3D models of the infrastructure, which enables more efficient and rapid network deployment upgrades and infrastructure inspection. Instead of having an engineer climb a tower or a rooftop, the engineer can use a drone to perform those inspections. By flying a drone, the work is done more quickly, safely and more inspections can be done in a day, accelerating the progress of the work. Verizon also uses its drones to rapidly restore its customer’s ability to access Verizon's network when natural disasters strike.“This achievement demonstrates that Verizon is truly operating above and beyond the current legal standards for commercial drone operations and that we are deploying drones to the same high standards as traditional commercial aviation,” said Dustin Schocken, head of Verizon Drone Use and Compliance (VZDUC). “These results validate Verizon’s advanced Safety Management System and the entire operating ecosystem in which we fly drones to support our business and our customers.”Story continuesIS-BAO Programme Director, Andrew Karas said, “Congratulations to Verizon Aviation RPAS for achieving IS-BAO and for their commitment to safety. The Verizon team worked hard for this accomplishment and provided valuable input to IBAC for RPAS safety standards development, similar to our manned operator standards, and reflect efforts made for the industry, and by the industry.”IS-BAO’s fundamental purpose is to foster standardized, safe, and highly professional aircraft operations. The voluntary IS-BAO safety standard is administered by IBAC, the International Business Aviation Council, a global business aviation advocacy group. The issuance of the IS-BAO registration certificate follows a 6-months-long, detailed audit of Verizon’s drone operations, governance, and safety standards.Verizon Communications Inc.

The company's shares received a lot of attention from a substantial price movement on the NASDAQGS over the last few months, increasing to US$192 at one point, and dropping to the lows of US$126. Some share price movements can give investors a better opportunity to enter into the stock, and potentially buy at a lower price. A question to answer is whether NVIDIA's current trading price of US$126 reflective of the actual value of the large-cap? Or is it currently undervalued, providing us with the opportunity to buy? Let’s take a look at NVIDIA’s outlook and value based on the most recent financial data to see if there are any catalysts for a price change. Check out our latest analysis for NVIDIA What's The Opportunity In NVIDIA?Great news for investors – NVIDIA is still trading at a fairly cheap price. According to my valuation, the intrinsic value for the stock is $193.91, which is above what the market is valuing the company at the moment. This indicates a potential opportunity to buy low. However, given that NVIDIA’s share is fairly volatile (i.e. its price movements are magnified relative to the rest of the market) this could mean the price can sink lower, giving us another chance to buy in the future. This is based on its high beta, which is a good indicator for share price volatility.What kind of growth will NVIDIA generate?earnings-and-revenue-growthInvestors looking for growth in their portfolio may want to consider the prospects of a company before buying its shares. Although value investors would argue that it’s the intrinsic value relative to the price that matter the most, a more compelling investment thesis would be high growth potential at a cheap price. With profit expected to grow by 35% over the next couple of years, the future seems bright for NVIDIA. It looks like higher cash flow is on the cards for the stock, which should feed into a higher share valuation.What This Means For YouAre you a shareholder? Since NVDA is currently undervalued, it may be a great time to accumulate more of your holdings in the stock. With a positive outlook on the horizon, it seems like this growth has not yet been fully factored into the share price. However, there are also other factors such as capital structure to consider, which could explain the current undervaluation.Story continuesAre you a potential investor? If you’ve been keeping an eye on NVDA for a while, now might be the time to enter the stock. Its buoyant future outlook isn’t fully reflected in the current share price yet, which means it’s not too late to buy NVDA. But before you make any investment decisions, consider other factors such as the strength of its balance sheet, in order to make a well-informed investment decision.It can be quite valuable to consider what analysts expect for NVIDIA from their most recent forecasts.

With this, the Fed Fund rate jumped to the range of 3-3.25% from a mere 0-0.25% in early March. The central bank has hiked the interest rate by 3% so far in 2022.Such a rigorous rate hike has happened for the first time since 1990, when the central bank recognized the Fed Fund rate as the principal monetary policy tool. This is not the end. What is alarming is that the central bank has projected more toughness for the rest of 2022 and 2023.Consequently, Wall Street melted on Sep 21, with the three major stock indexes — the Dow, the S&amp;P 500 and the Nasdaq Composite — falling 1.7%, 1.7% and 1.8%, respectively.

Inflation has soared to a 40-year high and in order to combat mounting inflation, the Fed has adopted an ultra-hawkish monetary stance. Year to date, the Dow, the S&amp;P 500 and the Nasdaq Composite – have plunged 16.9%, 20.5% and 28.3%, respectively.Story continuesA large section of economists and financial experts were expecting that the September FOMC meeting would be the last one for a 75 basis point rate hike. However, the Fed has raised the median of the Fed Fund rate to 4.4% in September from 3.4% in June.This means, the range of the benchmark lending rate at the end of 2022 will be 4.25-4.5%, indicating 75 basis-point and 50 basis-point interest rate hike in November and December, respectively.Market participants were expecting a rate cut in 2023, which is out of the question now as the central bank has projected that the median of the benchmark interest rate will reach 4.6% in 2023. This means another 50 basis-point rate hike throughout 2023. The first rate cut is not expected before 2024 as the Fed is expecting inflation to come down to its target rate of 2% in 2025.Investment analysts have estimated that there exists a 75% probability of the U.S. economy entering a recession either in the last quarter of 2022 or in the first quarter of 2023. The Fed has projected that the U.S. GDP will by a mere 0.2% in 2022 after contracting in the first two quarters. The projection for the unemployment rate has been scaled up to 4.4% by next year from the current projection of 3.7%.Our Top PicksWe have narrowed our search to five low-beta (beta value &gt; 0 &lt;1) high-yielding defensive stocks that have strong potential for the rest of 2022.

QGEN is gaining from impressive sales growth in the non-COVID-19 product portfolio. The company’s earnings and revenues in the second quarter of 2022 were ahead of the Zacks Consensus Estimate. Robust instrument placements throughout the quarter instill optimism. However, sales decline across several geographies and foreign exchange headwinds raise apprehension.In the past year, the Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock has lost 22.7% against a 42.6% decline of the industry and a 16.1% decline of the S&amp;P 500.The renowned medical device company has a market capitalization of $9.84 billion. Its earnings in the second quarter of 2022 surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 13.3%.In the past five years, the company registered earnings growth of 17.8% compared with the industry’s 17.9% rise and the S&amp;P 500’s 13.4% increase. The company’s long-term projected growth of 15.4% compares with the industry’s growth projection of 18.5% and the S&amp;P 500’s expectation of 11.5% growth.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchLet’s delve deeper.Factors in PlayQ2 Upsides: QIAGEN ended second-quarter 2022 with better-than-expected earnings and revenues. The uptick in sales in the non-COVID-19 product portfolio contributed to the top-line results. Robust CER gains across China, Australia and South Korea buoy optimism. The QIAcuity digital PCR instrument sales continued at a good momentum in the reported quarter, recording a milestone with more than 1,000 cumulative placements since launch.The raised full-year 2022 guidance for net sales and earnings per share also raises investors’ confidence.Huge Potential in Molecular Diagnostics: QIAGEN witnessed robust demand for sample preparation instruments. In sample technologies, instrument sales in the second quarter were supported by strong sales trends for the EZ2 instrument and higher placements of QIAcube Connect. Within diagnostic solutions, QIAGEN’s QuantiFERON-TB sales increased 19% at CER. Story continuesQIAstat-Dx sales delivered double-digit CER growth on strong consumables and new placements worldwide. NeuMoDx sales remained well on track to attain the full-year goal of about $80 million CER sales.Solid NGS Platform Prospects: QIAGEN’s NGS portfolio has been witnessing substantial revenue growth in the past few quarters. In the second quarter, sales of Genomics/NGS (including universal NGS products and bioinformatics solutions) improved 2% CER, excluding the year-ago impact of the genomics technology sale. The company witnessed single-digit CER growth across the non-COVID product groups banking on solid growth in universal NGS consumables.QIAGEN’s latest partnerships with NHS England and Element Biosciences are expected to add further growth momentum within the genomics business.DownsidesInternational Sales Discouraging: In the second quarter, QIAGEN’s revenues from Europe, the Middle East and Africa fell 21% on a reported basis due to the sharp decline in COVID testing trends. Revenues from Asia-Pacific/ Japan fell 6% reportedly as revenues from Japan saw a low-single-digit decline at CER. Sales from the Americas were also down 2% on a reported basis due to lower COVID-19 testing demand.Competitive Headwinds: Considering QIAGEN’s huge gamut of services, the company is also susceptible to competitive headwinds. The company faces increasing competition from firms that provide competitive pre-analytical solutions and other products used by its customers.Forex Woes: Recording more than 50% of its revenues from the international market, QIAGEN is highly exposed to the risk of foreign currency movement. The situation may worsen with the strengthening of the domestic currency against high-focus nations.Estimate TrendIn the past 60 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for QIAGEN’s 2022 earnings has moved 5.7% north to $2.10.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2022 revenues is pegged at $2.11 billion, suggesting a 6.2% fall from the 2021 reported number.Key PicksA few better-ranked stocks in the broader medical space that investors can consider are AMN Healthcare Services, Inc.

270,34d05561-edac-3cb4-b610-04f35e4e9092,MCK,2022-09-23,Abbott (ABT) Reports Favorable Findings From RELIEF Study,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/abbott-abt-reports-favorable-findings-172205527.html,1663867325,STORY,"['ABT', 'MCK', 'AMN', 'SWAV']","[Abbott Laboratories ABT recently presented new data from the Real World Evidence of FreeStyle Libre (RELIEF) study at the 58th Annual European Association for the Study of Diabetes (EASD) meeting. According to the latest findings, Type 2 diabetes patients receiving once-daily (basal) insulin therapy experienced a significantly lower rate of hospitalizations from acute diabetes events (ADEs) when using the FreeStyle Libre, a continuous glucose monitoring system (CGM).Currently, the FreeStyle Libre system is reimbursed for all Type 1 diabetes patients in most European countries. However, patients with Type 2 diabetes can only be reimbursed for the product if they meet certain requirements, like using insulin several times a day or having poorly controlled glucose levels.The RELIEF study’s results add to a growing body of evidence demonstrating the FreeStyle Libre system’s efficacy in reducing hospitalizations in Type 1 and Type 2 diabetes patients requiring multiple daily insulin injections. These favorable findings are likely to fortify Abbott’s diabetes care division.A Detailed View of the Study ResultsThe RELIEF study was conducted using the French national health claims database. The findings showed that 5,933 patients with Type 2 diabetes using the FreeStyle Libre system and adhering to a basal-only regimen had 67% fewer ADE-related hospitalizations one year after beginning the FreeStyle Libre treatment.The results also revealed a 75% reduction in hospitalizations for diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) and a 44% decline in admissions for severe hypoglycemia. Also, the study found that the use of the FreeStyle Libre system over two years demonstrated sustained reductions in hospitalizations, regardless of whether the patients were under the care of a diabetes specialist or a general healthcare practitioner.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchThe RELIEF study suggests that lowering the incidence of hypoglycemia and DKA may enhance adherence and help diabetes patients attain their glycemic targets. This is particularly important for the elderly, as hypoglycemia is linked to a significant increase in the risk of falls, fractures, dementia, and death.Story continuesIndustry ProspectsPer a report published in GlobeNewswire, the blood glucose monitoring devices market is expected to see a CAGR of 7.92% from 2021 to 2030. Factors such as the increase in diabetic patients worldwide, rapid technological enhancements and early diagnosis of hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia can be attributed to market growth.Given the market prospects, the RELIEF study’s latest findings backing the FreeStyle Libre seems strategic.Other Notable DevelopmentsThis month, Abbott launched its Amplatzer Talisman PFO Occlusion System in Europe. The Talisman device aims to treat patent foramen ovale (PFO) patients who have had a stroke and are at risk of having another. The novel Talisman system simplified doctors’ procedures while allowing patients to return to living fuller, healthier lives more quickly.In August 2022, the company received FDA approval for its novel Proclaim Plus spinal cord stimulation system featuring FlexBurst360 therapy. The FlexBurst360 therapy on the Proclaim Plus system enables physicians to detect the lowest effective dose of stimulation for each patient and alter it in response to changing pain requirements.Share Price PerformanceThe stock has outperformed its industry in the past year. It has declined 19.7% against the industry’s 51% fall.Zacks Rank and Key PicksCurrently, Abbott carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).A few better-ranked stocks in the broader medical space that investors can consider are AMN Healthcare Services, Inc.

NXGN is well-poised for growth in the coming quarters, courtesy of its solid product portfolio. A robust first-quarter fiscal 2023 performance, along with solid prospects in the Revenue Cycle Management (RCM) space, is expected to contribute further. NextGen’s operation in a competitive landscape and potential security breaches pose threats.Over the past year, this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock has gained 15.2% against a 49% decline of the industry and 16.1% fall of the S&amp;P 500.The renowned global provider of innovative and cloud-based healthcare technology solutions has a market capitalization of $1.16 billion. NextGen projects 9.5% growth for fiscal 2024 and expects to maintain a strong performance. Its earnings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three of the trailing four quarters and missed the same in the other, the average surprise being 10.5%.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchLet’s delve deeper.Solid Product Portfolio: We are optimistic about NextGen’s innovative cloud-based healthcare technology solutions that empower healthcare practices. Its portfolio includes tightly integrated solutions that deliver on ambulatory healthcare imperatives, including consumerism, digitization, risk allocation, regulatory influence and integrated care and health equity.In August, NextGen announced the addition of increased functionality to NextGen Virtual Visits, allowing practices and patients to participate in virtual group visits and invite additional stakeholders to telehealth appointments.Lucrative Prospects in the RCM Space: NextGen is a major player in the U.S. RCM market, which raises our optimism. NextGen Healthcare has been maintaining its strength among all ambulatory vendors in key RCM areas, which include effective claims processing, patient-facing support performance, the efficiency gained by customers, sustainability of pricing and trust as a business partner. Based on the popularity of the RCM solution, the company plans to expand into dental and hospital markets, which will further drive top-line growth in our view.Story continuesStrong Q1 Results: NextGen’s solid first-quarter fiscal 2023 results, along with the year-over-year uptick in the top line, buoy optimism. Strength in Recurring revenues and the robust increase in Subscription services revenues in the quarter are encouraging. Continued strength in the NextGen Office and Enterprise domains and a host of surround solutions, such as mobile and telehealth, augurs well.DownsidesStiff Competition: The markets for healthcare information systems are intensely competitive and NextGen faces significant competition from various sources. Several of its competitors have substantially greater resources. Some of the larger competitors, having greater scale than NextGen, may continue to become more active in the markets through internal development and acquisitions.Security Breaches: NextGen’s services involve the storage, transmission and processing of clients’ proprietary information and protected health information of patients. If security measures are breached or failed due to third-party action, unauthorized access to client or patient data may be obtained. This could damage NextGen’s reputation and its business. The company could face damages for contract breaches and high costs for remediation in the present and to prevent future occurrences.Estimate TrendNextGen is witnessing a negative estimate revision trend for fiscal 2023. In the past 90 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for its earnings has moved 3.1% south to 95 cents.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company’s second-quarter fiscal 2023 revenues is pegged at $156.5 million, suggesting a 4.8% improvement from the year-ago quarter’s reported number.Key PicksSome better-ranked stocks in the broader medical space are AMN Healthcare Services, Inc.

The company is currently progressing with the divestiture of its European business. These divestitures will allow the company to focus on its key growth market — the United States.In June, McKesson formed a joint venture with HCA Healthcare HCA to create a fully integrated oncology research organization. Per the deal, McKesson and HCA Healthcare will integrate their respective research units — US Oncology Research (USOR) and Sarah Cannon Research Institute (SCRI). The newly created entity with the combined capabilities of SCRI and USOR is expected to boost clinical research, ramp up the development of drugs, lead to better data and analytics capabilities, and pave the way for a wider portfolio of clinical trials. The deal between McKesson and HCA Healthcare is likely to be completed later this year.Story continuesMcKesson is a major player in the pharmaceutical and medical supplies distribution market. The Distribution Solutions segment caters to a wide range of customers and businesses and stands to benefit from increased generic utilization, inflation in generics, courtesy of several patent expirations in the next few years, and an aging population.During the fiscal first quarter of 2023, McKesson’s growth was led by its strong performance across all segments, except the International segment, which was marred by unfavorable currency movement. The divestiture of McKesson’s Austrian business also hurt growth.The company removed a major overhang during the fiscal first quarter by settling or signing a settlement agreement related to the opioid-related claims of all 50 states, as well as the District of Columbia and all eligible territories. These developments will close long-pending litigations that have been hurting the company’s goodwill and will also reduce legal expenses.McKesson’s agreements with the U.S. government for COVID-19 vaccine distribution, kitting and storage programs and COVID-19 tests are an added benefit.What’s Hurting the Stock?McKesson’s broad settlement of opioid-related claims of states and municipalities is likely to drive expenses for the company in the short term. The company recorded a pre-tax charge of $74 million during the fiscal first quarter of 2023 related to the settlement of an opioid-related claim with certain states and counties.McKesson Corporation PriceMcKesson Corporation PriceMcKesson Corporation price | McKesson Corporation QuoteEstimates TrendFor fiscal 2023, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues is pegged at $276.9 billion, indicating an improvement of 4.9% from the year-ago period’s reported figure.

With this, the Fed Fund rate jumped to the range of 3-3.25% from a mere 0-0.25% in early March. The central bank has hiked the interest rate by 3% so far in 2022.Such a rigorous rate hike has happened for the first time since 1990, when the central bank recognized the Fed Fund rate as the principal monetary policy tool. This is not the end. What is alarming is that the central bank has projected more toughness for the rest of 2022 and 2023.Consequently, Wall Street melted on Sep 21, with the three major stock indexes — the Dow, the S&amp;P 500 and the Nasdaq Composite — falling 1.7%, 1.7% and 1.8%, respectively. At this juncture, defensive sectors like utilities, consumer staples and health care will be best bets.Further, we need to select those stocks from those sectors that have a low beta and good dividend yield in order to counter extreme volatility. Five such stocks with a favorable Zacks Rank are — NextEra Energy Inc. NEE, The Southern Co. SO, PepsiCo Inc. PEP, Corteva Inc.

Year to date, the Dow, the S&amp;P 500 and the Nasdaq Composite – have plunged 16.9%, 20.5% and 28.3%, respectively.A large section of economists and financial experts were expecting that the September FOMC meeting would be the last one for a 75 basis point rate hike. However, the Fed has raised the median of the Fed Fund rate to 4.4% in September from 3.4% in June.This means, the range of the benchmark lending rate at the end of 2022 will be 4.25-4.5%, indicating 75 basis-point and 50 basis-point interest rate hike in November and December, respectively.Market participants were expecting a rate cut in 2023, which is out of the question now as the central bank has projected that the median of the benchmark interest rate will reach 4.6% in 2023. This means another 50 basis-point rate hike throughout 2023. The first rate cut is not expected before 2024 as the Fed is expecting inflation to come down to its target rate of 2% in 2025.Story continuesInvestment analysts have estimated that there exists 75% probability of the U.S. economy entering a recession either in the last quarter of 2022 or in the first quarter of 2023. The Fed has projected that the U.S. GDP will by a mere 0.2% in 2022 after contracting in the first two quarters. The projection for the unemployment rate has been scaled up to 4.4% by next year from the current projection of 3.7%.Our Top PicksWe have narrowed our search to five low-beta (beta value &gt; 0 &lt;1) high-yielding defensive stocks that have strong potential for the rest of 2022.

A previous hoax used a similar image of Donald Trump lying in a coffin to falsely claim the series had predicted his death due to COVID.The Queen appeared as a character on “The Simpsons” six times, according to the fan-curated Wikisimpsons site, including in a 2003 episode titled “The Regina Monologues” from Season 15 in which the monarch’s carriage was rear-ended by Homer (pictured above).“The Simpsons” famously has predicted other major events. In a 2000 episode, the series included a joke that Donald Trump would become president of the United States.

I signed up on the spot and the experience was absolutely wonderful,"" said James, who received a ComEd home energy assessment for his residence in Chicago’s Beverly View neighborhood. ""The energy advisor who visited my home was cordial and knowledgeable about what it took to help save energy at my home. The biggest benefit to me was the installation of energy-efficient showerheads and faucet aerators and hot-water pipe insulation. Not only has this helped my electric bill, but my wife was able to water the garden all summer and even our water bill was reasonable.""James is one of many northern Illinois residents who, since 2014, have signed up for a home energy assessment and who, together, qualified for a total of nearly $30 million in free energy-saving products and incentives.""ComEd is always looking for ways to make it affordable for families and individuals to access clean and reliable electricity,"" said Melissa Washington, ComEd's chief customer officer and senior vice president of customer operations. ""One of the biggest ways is by signing up for a free home energy assessment, which not only provides immediate home savings, but plans for unlocking additional savings into the future.""Through home energy assessments, customers have saved more than 125 million kilowatt-hours of electricity, which is enough energy to power more than 14,000 ComEd customers’ homes for one year. The offering also helped reduce from the air more than 106 million pounds of carbon emissions that contribute to climate change, which is the equivalent of removing more than 10,000 cars off the road for one year or planting nearly 60,000 acres of trees.Story continuesHome energy assessments, which are part of ComEd’s award-winning Energy Efficiency Program, are designed to improve the energy efficiency of a home and lower its energy costs, while enhancing the comfort of those who live within it.Homeowners and renters receive a free review of their home – either in-person or virtually – to identify areas for energy savings. An energy advisor will collect information about a home's energy features by looking at its lighting, heating and cooling systems, water heaters and appliances. The advisor then provides personalized recommendations for saving energy and money.During the assessment, the advisor may install free and discounted energy-saving products, including LEDs, a programmable or smart thermostat, WaterSense certified showerheads and faucet aerators, hot water pipe insulation and advanced power strips. Assessments can be conducted for single-family homes. A separate program is available for multi-unit buildings.

However, it’s also clear that thanks to hotter-than-expected inflation readings, the central bank has its work cut out for it.Another factor to consider is the worsening geopolitical situation. Recently, Russia stirred the pot of its invasion of Ukraine by cutting off natural gas to Europe via the Nord Stream 1 pipeline. Effectively, a large portion of hydrocarbon supplies is now offline to the western world. Almost invariably, then, this catalyst will boost energy stocks to buy.As well, tensions tend to beget tensions. For instance, the former Soviet countries of Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan are fighting amid flaring historical and ethnic tensions.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsTherefore, with so much volatility, it’s wise for investors to focus on energy stocks to buy.COPConocoPhillips$113.16DVNDevon Energy$66.71CTRACoterra Energy$28.90SLBSchlumberger$38.77KMIKinder Morgan$17.89VLOValero Energy$103.99MUSAMurphy USA$279.17ConocoPhillips (COP)a sign in front of the Conoco Philips office buildingSource: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock.comA vertically integrated hydrocarbon company, ConocoPhillips (NYSE:COP) involves itself in every aspect of energy production. To be fair, though, it nowadays focuses largely on the upstream component, which handles on exploration and production. Given that geopolitics did a number on energy stocks to buy because of supply crunch implications, COP stock likewise suffered.Heading into the weekend, the stock closed the Friday, Sept. 16 session down 2%. For the week ending that Friday, COP slipped a little more than 1%. Of course, ConocoPhillips doesn’t represent the biggest discounted opportunity among energy stocks to buy. Nevertheless, because of its wide footprint and increasing global demand for hydrocarbon supplies, any dip may be a buy signal.Story continuesGurufocus labels COP as “fairly valued.” Arguably the company’s best feature from a financial perspective is its profitability metrics. One highlight is its operating margin, which stands at 33.13%. In comparison, the oil and gas industry median is 7.4%.Devon Energy (DVN)The logo for Devon Energy (DVN) is displayed on a sign outside an office.Source: Jeff Whyte / Shutterstock.comOn a similar fundamental note to ConocoPhillips above, Devon Energy (NYSE:DVN) benefits from the wild circumstances cynically bolstering energy stocks. Effectively, when Russia invaded Ukraine and subsequently responded to U.S. and European sanctions with its own commodity-based penalties, it weaponized hydrocarbons. Now cut off from a valuable energy source, Europe is scrambling for solutions.Unfortunately, a hydrocarbon bailout might not be arriving, per energy bosses. Nevertheless, European leaders must understand that this struggle will have years-long (perhaps decades-long) consequences. Therefore, the broader narrative supports independent oil and gas exploration and production firms like Devon Energy.Better yet, because the U.S. market finds more than enough distractions to keep it occupied, Wall Street may not be appreciating the long-term implications for DVN. Last Friday, DVN dropped nearly 4% while for the week it fell more than 5%. However, this is likely a temporary circumstance. Against a longer-term framework, DVN is one of the best energy stocks to buy.Coterra Energy (CTRA)Momentum stocks: Natural gas pipeline through green field with blue sky aboveSource: ShutterstockAt issue regarding the geopolitical flashpoint in eastern Europe is natural gas. Specifically, liquefied natural gas (LNG) is natural gas which is cooled at a liquefaction facility to approximately -260°F at atmospheric pressure. The end result facilitates an easier canvas for international transportation.Significantly, Coterra Energy (NYSE:CTRA) and sector competitor Devon Energy are both exploring new LNG opportunities, per Reuters. According to an article from May 2022, “Demand for U.S. LNG has boomed in recent months, driven by shortages in Europe and supply concerns after Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.” Indeed, such a statement turned prescient given Russia’s weaponization of hydrocarbon outflows.Despite the long-term positive implications for Coterra, CTRA took a massive hit on Friday, suffering a 6.5% loss. Over the trailing week, it lost 4.5% of market value. Not only that, in the trailing month, shares declined by nearly 5%. Nevertheless, the geopolitical narrative simply runs too hot to ignore Coterra. Therefore, CTRA is one of the energy stocks to buy on the dip.Schlumberger (SLB)slb stockSource: Valentin Martynov / Shutterstock.comIf you’re looking for a somewhat safer (in context of course) idea among energy stocks, Schlumberger (NYSE:SLB) fits the bill. An oilfield services company, Schlumberger plays a vital role on an infrastructural level. Put another way, an upstream (exploration and production) firm carries the risk of not finding anything useful. However, Schlumberger serves an existing demand base.As well, the company will likely see cynical geopolitical benefits that have bolstered other energy stocks over the long run. With Russia’s energy weaponization, multiple countries are desperately seeking reliable sources of hydrocarbons. Presumably, then, the oilfields will be busy, bolstering the narrative for SLB stock.However, Wall Street at the moment doesn’t see it that way. Last Friday, SLB declined by 3.2%. Over the week ending Sept. 16, SLB dropped over 4%. And in the trailing half-year period, SLB is in the red by 6%. Still, with energy prices likely to rise according to expert forecasts, Schlumberger represents one of the energy stocks to buy on the dip.Kinder Morgan (KMI)Kinder Morgan logo on a sign outside the company headquarters in Houston.Source: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock.comOne of the largest energy infrastructure companies in North America, Kinder Morgan (NYSE:KMI) represents a powerhouse in the midstream segment. Essentially, midstream operators are the stagehands of the hydrocarbon industry. Dealing with areas such as storage and transportation, they’re background players, quietly and diligently providing the connection between upstream and downstream companies.In many cases, you don’t hear about midstream players until something bad happens. However, as an investor, you should pay close attention, particularly to KMI. Gurufocus considers Kinder Morgan “modestly undervalued.” Featuring a relatively balanced financial profile, the company’s greatest strength lies in its profitability metrics. A standout is its operating margin of 21.6%, much higher than the aforementioned sector median of 7.4%.Still, Wall Street is giving you a great deal on KMI. On Friday, the stock declined 2.6%. Over the trailing week, it slipped 4.5%. Over the trailing month, shares are down 4% and on a trailing half-year basis, shares fell 1%. Consider grabbing this discount before it and other energy stocks jump higher.Valero Energy (VLO)A daytime picture of a Valero (VLO) gas station located in San Francisco bay and clear blue sky in the background.Source: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.comAlthough Valero Energy (NYSE:VLO) involves itself in several components of the hydrocarbon business, it features a viable downstream business. Technically, when analysts talk about downstream hydrocarbon specialists, they refer to “processes that occur after the production phase to the point of sale.” In simple terms, if it goes into your fuel tank, it’s downstream.What I appreciate about energy stocks to buy tethered to the downstream segment is price inelasticity. Of course, fluctuating prices impact consumer behaviors. Specifically, though, baseline demand is inelastic. At a certain point, consumers must buy fuel to get to where they’re going, irrespective of the cost.However, as logical as that might sound, Wall Street doesn’t believe in the thesis, apparently. Over the trailing week ended Sept. 16, VLO dropped about 10% of market value. In the trailing month, shares dipped more than 11%. Still, I expect this trajectory to turn around because of the inelasticity principle mentioned earlier.Murphy USA (MUSA)Murphy USA gas station and convenience store located on an out parcel of a Walmart SupercenterSource: Lawrence Glass / Shutterstock.comAnother downstream specialist, Murphy USA (NYSE:MUSA) represents one of the energy stocks that rarely went on discount this year. Now that it’s doing so, investors ought to pay attention to MUSA stock.On Friday, Murphy USA lost about 1.8% of market value. In the week ended Sept. 16, MUSA dropped more than 5%. Against the trailing month, the red ink comes out to a magnitude of 6.1%. However, on a wider scale, we’re talking about a security that gained a hair over 40% for the year. It’s certainly not a name to ignore.One major factor that separates Murphy USA from other downstream energy stocks is economics. The company represents one of the largest independent retailers of gasoline products and convenience store merchandise. More importantly, it strategically locates its stations near discount-oriented big-box retailers.That should go a long way in helping both budget-sensitive customers as well as folks who have money but also don’t mind a discount.On the date of publication, Josh Enomoto did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.A former senior business analyst for Sony Electronics, Josh Enomoto has helped broker major contracts with Fortune Global 500 companies.

295,2eef7b77-e431-3d80-b800-1b7870306649,MU,2022-09-23,Earnings Preview: Micron (MU) Q4 Earnings Expected to Decline,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/earnings-preview-micron-mu-q4-140002425.html,1663855202,STORY,['MU'],"[Micron (MU) is expected to deliver a year-over-year decline in earnings on lower revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended August 2022. This widely-known consensus outlook gives a good sense of the company's earnings picture, but how the actual results compare to these estimates is a powerful factor that could impact its near-term stock price.The earnings report, which is expected to be released on September 29, 2022, might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations, it's worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise.Zacks Consensus EstimateThis chipmaker is expected to post quarterly earnings of $1.42 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of -41.3%.Revenues are expected to be $6.94 billion, down 16.2% from the year-ago quarter.Estimate Revisions TrendThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 1.38% lower over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change.Earnings WhisperEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction).The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Story continuesThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Micron?For Micron, the Most Accurate Estimate is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bullish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of +2.86%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #5.So, this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Micron will beat the consensus EPS estimate.Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that Micron would post earnings of $2.44 per share when it actually produced earnings of $2.59, delivering a surprise of +6.15%.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times.Bottom LineAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.Micron doesn't appear a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.Stay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

298,682c2173-8553-34c9-8469-4cf5304dbfcf,PLD,2022-09-23,"Forget Rate Hike, Bet on 3 REITs to Survive Market Volatility",Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/forget-rate-hike-bet-3-140502633.html,1663855502,STORY,"['FR', 'PLD', 'TRNO']","[As anticipated, the Federal Reserve has raised the benchmark interest rate by three-quarters of a percentage point to 3.00%-3.25%. Further to tame inflation, Fed has indicated more rate hikes ahead, with officials’ median projection for rates reaching 4.4% by the end of this year and a peak of 4.6% in 2023.However, if you believe that this latest rate hike and the projections for this year and the next have put REITs on the back foot, then you need to reconsider and focus on Prologis, Inc. PLD, First Industrial Realty Trust, Inc. FR and Terreno Realty Corporation TRNO.This is because this hybrid asset class not only provides protection against inflation but also benefits from the improving fundamentals of the underlying asset categories and the location of properties. A number of the asset categories are presently showing strength.Particularly, the industrial real estate market is still firing on all cylinders with robust demand, rents and occupancy growth. In addition to the fast adoption of e-commerce, a rise in the inventory levels of companies as a precautionary measure for any supply-chain disruption is expected to lead to long-term growth momentum for this sector, offering scope to industrial landlords.Despite economic headwinds in the second quarter, demand in the U.S. industrial market outpaced supply for the seventh straight quarter, per a report from Cushman &amp; Wakefield (“CWK”). There was a net absorption of 120.4 million square feet (msf) of space in the June quarter and 236.3 msf through the first half of the year. Per the CWK report, this robust demand for industrial space is anticipated to continue, with net absorption projected to surpass 400 msf in 2022 and 250 msf in 2023.Moreover, over the past decade, not only have the REITs made their balance sheets less leveraged, they have locked in the low rates by borrowing at a fixed rate and extending the average maturity of their debt outstanding.In the second quarter of 2022, the weighted average term to maturity of REIT debt was more than seven years or 87 months. This is up from 85.5 months in the prior quarter, per a NAREIT media release. Net interest expense as a percent of net operating income (NOI) fell to a record low of 16.8% in the second quarter from 17.7% in the prior quarter. Also, leverage ratios remained low compared to the historical average.After managing their balance sheets efficiently, REITs are now well prepared for a rising rate environment. Instead of looking for debt to finance the portfolios, these companies have strategically resorted to equity capital over the past decade.Moreover, REITs provide natural protection against inflation. Particularly, rents and real estate values tend to move north with prices increasing, thereby aiding dividend growth. In fact, the majority of leases are tied with inflation, which leads to rent increases as inflation goes up. Therefore, even amid the inflationary period, investment in the REIT industry can offer a steady income stream.Finally, with the roller coaster ride in the stock market this year — thanks to high inflation and a quick rise in interest rates that is weighing on asset prices — the focus has now shifted to investing in quality companies with a consistent track of paying dividends. Obviously, this brings us to the REITs because solid dividend payouts are arguably the biggest enticements for REIT investors as U.S. law requires REITs to distribute 90% of their annual taxable income in the form of dividends. This has enabled the industry to stand out and gain a footing over the last 15-20 years.Story continuesStock PicksSan Francisco-based Prologis is a behemoth of the industrial REIT category. It focuses on logistics real estate in high-barrier, high-growth markets. Given its solid capacity to offer modern logistics facilities, the company is well-poised to bank on the favorable trend in the industrial real estate market.In June, Prologis announced that it will acquire Duke Realty in an all-stock transaction valued at $26 billion, including the assumption of debt. The transaction is expected to be completed in the fourth quarter of 2022.Prologis’ current cash flow growth is projected at 49.66%, well ahead of the 9.7% growth estimated for the industry. Moreover, this REIT’s trailing 12-month return on equity (ROE) highlights its growth potential. The company’s ROE of 9.85% compares favorably with the industry’s 3.76%, reflecting that PLD is more efficient in using shareholders’ funds than its peers. Given its balance sheet strength and prudent financial management, the company is well-poised to capitalize on growth opportunities and boost shareholders’ wealth.Based on the dividends paid over the trailing four quarters, PLD’s dividend yield is 2.44%. Also, Prologis has increased its dividend five times in the last five years, and the five-year annualized dividend growth rate is 11.29%. This is attractive to income investors and represents a steady income stream. Check Prologis’ dividend history here.Prologis, Inc. Dividend Yield (TTM)Prologis, Inc.

FR is engaged in the management, lease, acquisition, (re)development and selling of bulk and regional distribution centers, light industrial and other industrial facility types across major markets in the United States.Analysts have a bullish view on First Industrial, with the Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2022 FFO per share moving up to $2.20 from $2.18 over the past two months. This indicates an 11.7% increase year over year on 9.4% revenue growth to $521.1 million. FR currently has a Zacks Rank #2.First Industrial’s current cash flow growth is projected at 22.63% compared with the 9.70% growth projected for the industry. Moreover, this REIT’s trailing 12-month ROE highlights its growth potential.

301,5b93fa82-5f4b-341e-aaf5-c4ccd32ca388,PCAR,2022-09-23,3 Stocks in Focus as Domestic Auto Industry Shows Resiliency,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/3-stocks-focus-domestic-auto-133201436.html,1663853521,STORY,"['F', 'PCAR', '^GSPC', 'GM']","[The Zacks Domestic Auto industry, despite being highly cyclical, seems to be holding its ground. Rising interest rates and high inflation are not weighing on the demand for vehicles. While the devasted supply chain system is certainly a pain point and is affecting production volumes, increasing the prices of vehicles is largely offsetting the decline in output. Automakers are passing on the escalating costs of commodities to consumers by way of a hike in model prices. Most importantly, the popularity of electric vehicles (EVs) is soaring each passing day and auto biggies are fast cementing their position in this domain. Industry participants like General Motors GM, Ford F and PACCAR PCAR should be on your radar to fetch handsome long-term returns.Industry OverviewThe Zacks Domestic Auto industry includes companies that are engaged in designing, manufacturing and retailing vehicles across the globe. These include passenger cars, crossover vehicles, sport utility vehicles, trucks, vans, motorcycles and electric vehicles. The industry — which is highly consumer cyclic and provides employment to a large number of people — is at the forefront of innovation, courtesy of its nature and the transformation that it is going through. The widespread usage of technology and rapid digitization are resulting in the fundamental restructuring of the automotive market. Several companies in the industry have engine and transmission plants and conduct research and development and testing of electric and autonomous vehicles.Key Investing Themes Demand Holds Steady Despite Stubborn Inflation: Despite sky-high inflation, rising interest rates and economic slowdown, buyers’ appetite for vehicles has held relatively steady. The top two Detroit auto biggies General Motors and Ford are not seeing signs of softening demand as yet. In fact, in August, new vehicle sales in the United States rose 4.3% year over year and 0.3% from the July level, per Automotive Industry Portal MarkLines.Story continuesSupply Chain Snafu Has Been a Major Sticking Point: Automakers are battling a severe chip crisis aggravated by the Russia-Ukraine war and lockdown restrictions in China. Many auto biggies are temporarily suspending operations and slashing their production targets amid logistical challenges. There are no signs of the easing of chip issues in the near term, which are going to limit automakers’ production volumes. Experts expect the shortage to linger in 2023 as well.Commodity and Operational Cost Headwinds Remain: Prices of raw materials are soaring and are not likely to abate anytime soon. Most automakers have already warned that commodity inflation will remain a major headwind for quite some time. Ford recently announced that its third-quarter profits are likely to take a hit as it expects its cost of auto parts to be $1 billion higher than expected. Additionally, massive R&amp;D expenses for the development of high-tech cars would also likely strain near-term cash flows.High Vehicle Prices Mostly Offsetting Cost Woes: As inventory challenges are mounting amid supply-demand imbalance, the average prices of vehicles (both new and used) are shooting up. As automakers are successfully managing to pass on the burden of escalating input costs to consumers, their revenues have not dwindled yet. With prices going through the roof, many customers are willing to pay a premium for their preferred vehicle. But then, another set of consumers is unwilling to pay a heavy premium and is waiting on the sidelines in the light of high prices and high borrowing rates.Soaring EV Sales Continue to be a Bright Spot: Inclination toward green cars is serving as a key catalyst. Climate change concerns, technological advancement and stringent fuel-emission standards are increasing green vehicles’ adoption. Demand for electric cars is off the charts. For the first half of 2022, around 414,000 EVs were delivered. EV share as a percentage of new cars sold improved to 6% in the first half of 2022 from 3% in the corresponding period of last year. The latest Inflation Reduction Act will fuel EV sales further.Zacks Industry Rank Indicates Decent ProspectsThe Zacks Automotive – Domestic industry is a 22-stock group within the broader Zacks Auto-Tires-Trucks sector. The industry currently carries a Zacks Industry Rank #95, which places it in the top 38% of more than 250 Zacks industries.The group’s Zacks Industry Rank, which is basically the average of the Zacks Rank of all the member stocks, indicates encouraging near-term prospects. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperform the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.The industry’s positioning in the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries is a result of a positive earnings outlook for the constituent companies in aggregate. Looking at the aggregate earnings estimate revisions, it appears that analysts are gaining confidence in this group’s earnings growth potential. The industry’s earnings estimates for 2022 have risen around 6% since Jun 30.Before we present you three industry participants worth considering for your portfolio, let's take a look at the industry’s stock market performance and current valuation.Industry Outperforms S&amp;P 500 &amp; SectorThe Domestic Auto industry has surpassed the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite over the past year. The industry has moved up 1.7% versus the S&amp;P 500 and sector’s decline of 14.6% and 14.9%, respectively, over the said time frame.One-Year Price PerformanceIndustry's Current ValuationSince automotive companies are debt laden, it makes sense to value them based on the EV/EBITDA (Enterprise Value/ Earnings before Interest Tax Depreciation and Amortization) ratio. On the basis of the trailing 12-month enterprise value to EBITDA (EV/EBITDA), the industry is currently trading at 29.34X compared with the S&amp;P 500’s 11.86X and the sector’s 15.82X. Over the past five years, the industry has traded as high as 54.74X, as low as 8.85X and at a median of 15.26X, as the chart below shows.EV/EBITDA Ratio (Past Five Years) 3 Stocks to Add to WatchlistPACCAR: A leading name in the trucking business, PACCAR’s wide range of trucks carries a solid reputation. The launch of Peterbilt 579 and Kenworth T680 along with the new line of DAF trucks in the European Union market with higher fuel efficiencies should boost prospects. PACCAR’s accelerated efforts toward electrification, connected vehicle services and advanced driver-assistance system options augur well. Its Parts and Financial Services segments gain from a broad dealer network. PACCAR’s strong balance sheet is complemented by A+ and A1 credit ratings assigned by Standard &amp; Poor's and Moody's, respectively.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for PACCAR’s 2022 earnings and sales implies year-over-year growth of 45.3% and 22%, respectively. The consensus mark for 2022 earnings has moved north by 7.8% over the past 60 days. PACCAR currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) and has a VGM Score of B.  You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 (Strong Buy) Rank stocks here. Price and Consensus: PCARGeneral Motors: One of the world’s largest automakers, General Motors’ U.S. market share was 14.4% of the industry’s total sales in 2021.U.S. legacy automaker General Motors’ prospects shine bright, courtesy of its hot-selling brands in America like Chevrolet Silverado, Equinox and GMC Sierra. GM’s big push toward EVs is commendable. The automaker plans to roll out 30 fresh EV models by 2025-end.  Key launches, including the GMC Hummer EV, Cadillac Lyriq crossover EV, Equinox EV, Silverdo EV and Blazer EV, among others, are expected to buoy top-line growth.

The Ford+ plan, with a deep focus on increasing profitability, exploring the e-mobility future and enhancing customer experience, sparks optimism.

The company’s improving financials provide a solid foundation for investment in Ford+ priorities.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Ford’s 2022 earnings and sales implies year-over-year growth of 32% and 16%, respectively. The consensus mark for 2022 earnings has moved 10.6% north over the past 60 days.

Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: Shell plc SHEL, The Williams Companies WMB, Cheniere Energy LNG, APA Corp. APA and TechnipFMC FTI.Here are highlights from Wednesday’s Analyst Blog:Oil &amp; Gas Roundup: Successions, Acquisitions and MoreIt was a week when both oil and natural gas prices continued their decline.On the news front, Europe’s largest oil company Shell plc announced the departure of chief executive officer (CEO) Ben van Beurden next year, while energy infrastructure operator The Williams Companies closed the buyout of natural gas storage firm NorTex Midstream. Developments associated with Cheniere Energy, APA Corp. and TechnipFMC also made it to the headlines.Overall, it was another bearish seven-day period for the sector. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures lost 1.9% to close at $85.11 per barrel, while natural gas prices decreased 2.9% to end at $7.764 per million British thermal units (MMBtu).U.S. oil prices moved lower as the Energy Information Administration (""EIA"") showed a build in stockpiles in its latest weekly release. As it is, crude remained under pressure from familiar fears revolving around high inflation and slowing growth. A stronger greenback, which can weaken dollar-denominated commodities like crude, also contributed to the downside.Natural gas notched a bigger weekly loss, primarily due to a bearish inventory report. Unfavorable weather forecasts and a spurt in production have also been blamed for pushing prices lower.Recap of the Week’s Most-Important Stories1. Shell has declared that the incumbent CEO of the company — Ben van Beurden — will step down from his position by the end of 2022. Wael Sawan, SHEL’s head of gas and renewables, will succeed Ben van Beurden and take charge as the CEO, starting Jan 1, 2023.Story continuesBen van Beurden, however, will continue working as an adviser to the board till Jun 30, 2023, after which he will leave the group. He has been serving as the CEO of the British energy major since January 2014. Prior to this, Ben van Beurden served as the downstream director and as the executive vice president of chemicals before that. During his tenure, Shell acquired the British multinational oil and gas company — BG Group plc — which turned out to be one of SHEL’s largest acquisitions in decades.Presently serving as the director of integrated gas, renewables and energy solutions, Wael Sawan is expected to help continue Shell’s green transition strategy, which aims at cutting down the firm’s greenhouse-gas emissions and its transformational strategy initiated by Ben van Beurden. Having previously worked as the director of upstream, Sawan has been part of the organization for more than 25 years. (Shell to Replace Current CEO With Wael Sawan in 2023)2. The Williams Companies recently announced that it has concluded the $423-million deal to acquire Houston-based NorTex Midstream, a fully contracted natural gas pipeline and storage asset, from the private equity firm Tailwater Capital’s affiliate.As part of the contract, the Tulsa, OK-based pipeline operator will take over NorTex assets. These include roughly about 80 miles of natural gas transmission pipelines along with 36 billion cubic feet of natural gas storage in the Dallas-Fort Worth market.Per WMB, NorTex assets offer crucial service to almost 4 GW of gas-fired power generation, allowing Texas energy providers to meet peak demand effectively. The assets also enable Williams to provide storage services for the Permian gas directed toward the rising Gulf Coast LNG demand. (Williams Acquires NorTex Midstream Assets for $423M)3. Cheniere Energy, the Houston, TX-based liquefied natural gas exporter, recently announced its intention to pay higher dividends and augment share buybacks while adding to its production units.This comes at a time when Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) Cheniere’s profits are up due to mounting energy prices and liquefied natural gas demand as a result of Europe trying to find alternatives to Russian gas over Moscow’s military action in Ukraine.You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.LNG will hike its annual dividend by 20% to $1.58 per share from the $1.32 payout initiated last year. Moreover, the firm projects more than $20 billion of available cash through 2026 and more than $20 per share of run-rate distributable cash flow. The full-year 2022 distributable cash flow forecast was increased to the range of $8.1 billion-$8.6 billion from the earlier guidance range of $6.9-$7.4 billion. (Cheniere to Increase Repurchase, Raises Earnings Forecast)4   APA Corp. recently got approval from the board of directors to increase the quarterly dividend by 12.5 cents to 25 cents per share. The new payout will be on Nov 22 to its common shareholders of record on Oct 21. Following the 100% hike this quarter, APA’s annual dividend of $1 per share yields 2.41%, which is better than the S&amp;P 500’s 1.54%.The macro environment for U.S. Exploration &amp; Production operators like APA remains robust, thanks to high commodity prices and improved fundamentals that should aid long-term growth. This positive backdrop, together with APA’s significant debt profile improvement and healthy cash flows, allows the company to reward investors with a dividend hike.APA management sees the dividend hike as part of its commitment to return a minimum of 60% of free cash flow to shareholders each year. However, stock buyback continues to be the company’s preferred tool to distribute cash, with APA adding another 40 million shares to its buyback authorization. (APA Ups Shareholder Returns: Hikes Dividend, Expands Buyback)5   TechnipFMC declared that it was awarded a “significant” engineering, procurement, construction and installation contract by TotalEnergies for its Lapa North East field situated in the pre-salt Santos Basin offshore Brazil. Located in the pre-salt Santos Basin, the Lapa field commenced oil production in 2016 via the MODEC-supplied FPSO Cidade de Caraguatatuba MV27.Per the contract, the French-American, U.K.-domiciled oilfield services major will reconfigure and set up umbilicals and flexible pipes in a new configuration that will further secure the production of the field. Per TechnipFMC’s definition of a significant contract, the deal is worth between $75 million and $250 million.President, Subsea, at TechnipFMC, Jonathan Landes, mentioned that the Brazilian offshore market is becoming more diverse concerning the scope of work as well as customer opportunity. “On Lapa North East, we are working with a valued client with whom we have built a trusted relationship. By offering the flexibility of a phased campaign, we are helping TotalEnergies accelerate its schedule and begin production sooner,"" he added. (TechnipFMC Gets EPCI Contract From TTE Offshore Brazil)Price PerformanceWith oil being in red for the week, stocks were down too. The Energy Select Sector SPDR — a popular way to track energy companies — was down 2.7% last week. But over the past six months, the sector tracker has increased 8.5%.What’s Next in the Energy World?Following last week’s sliding fortunes for oil and gas, market participants will closely track the regular releases to look for further guidance on the direction of prices. In this context, the U.S. government’s statistics on oil and natural gas — one of the few solid indicators that come out regularly — will be on energy traders' radar.Data on rig count from the oilfield service firm Baker Hughes, which is a pointer to the trends in U.S. crude/natural gas production, is closely followed too. News related to the ongoing Russia-Ukraine geopolitical conflict and the potential demand boost from the easing of coronavirus lockdowns in China will be the other factors that will dictate the near-term price movement of the commodities.Why Haven’t You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?Our 5 best-performing strategies have blown away the S&amp;P's impressive +28.8% gain in 2021.

322,dcf9eeff-6abe-3ce1-a08b-e56515db8c9e,KO,2022-09-23,Possible bearish signals as The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) insiders disposed of US$15m worth of stock,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/possible-bearish-signals-coca-cola-110046104.html,1663930846,STORY,['KO'],"[In the last year, many The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) insiders sold a substantial stake in the company which may have sparked shareholders' attention. Knowing whether insiders are buying is usually more helpful when evaluating insider transactions, as insider selling can have various explanations. However, when multiple insiders sell stock over a specific duration, shareholders should take notice as that could possibly be a red flag.While insider transactions are not the most important thing when it comes to long-term investing, logic dictates you should pay some attention to whether insiders are buying or selling shares. View our latest analysis for Coca-Cola The Last 12 Months Of Insider Transactions At Coca-ColaOver the last year, we can see that the biggest insider sale was by the Executive VP &amp; CFO, John Murphy, for US$3.3m worth of shares, at about US$62.29 per share. So what is clear is that an insider saw fit to sell at around the current price of US$59.26. While insider selling is a negative, to us, it is more negative if the shares are sold at a lower price. We note that this sale took place at around the current price, so it isn't a major concern, though it's hardly a good sign.In total, Coca-Cola insiders sold more than they bought over the last year. You can see a visual depiction of insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last 12 months, below. By clicking on the graph below, you can see the precise details of each insider transaction!insider-trading-volumeFor those who like to find winning investments this free list of growing companies with recent insider purchasing, could be just the ticket.Coca-Cola Insiders Are Selling The StockOver the last three months, we've seen notably more insider selling, than insider buying, at Coca-Cola. We note insiders cashed in US$2.9m worth of shares. On the flip side, insider Carolyn Everson spent US$61k on purchasing shares (as mentioned above) . Because the selling vastly outweighs the buying, we'd say this is a somewhat bearish sign.Story continuesDoes Coca-Cola Boast High Insider Ownership?For a common shareholder, it is worth checking how many shares are held by company insiders. Usually, the higher the insider ownership, the more likely it is that insiders will be incentivised to build the company for the long term. Coca-Cola insiders own 0.7% of the company, currently worth about US$1.7b based on the recent share price. I like to see this level of insider ownership, because it increases the chances that management are thinking about the best interests of shareholders.So What Does This Data Suggest About Coca-Cola Insiders?The stark truth for Coca-Cola is that there has been more insider selling than insider buying in the last three months. Despite some insider buying, the longer term picture doesn't make us feel much more positive. On the plus side, Coca-Cola makes money, and is growing profits. The company boasts high insider ownership, but we're a little hesitant, given the history of share sales. In addition to knowing about insider transactions going on, it's beneficial to identify the risks facing Coca-Cola. While conducting our analysis, we found that Coca-Cola has 2 warning signs and it would be unwise to ignore them.Of course Coca-Cola may not be the best stock to buy.

326,53267ac1-ff8b-3ae2-8663-ed1d43601dd5,WY,2022-09-23,Is Weyerhaeuser (WY) Suitable for Value Investors Now?,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/weyerhaeuser-wy-suitable-value-investors-151303602.html,1663859583,STORY,"['WY', '^GSPC']","[Value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment. After all, who wouldn’t want to find stocks that are either flying under the radar and are compelling buys, or offer up tantalizing discounts when compared to fair value?One way to find these companies is by looking at several key metrics and financial ratios, many of which are crucial in the value stock selection process. Let’s put Weyerhaeuser Company WY stock into this equation and find out if it is a good choice for value-oriented investors right now, or if investors subscribing to this methodology should look elsewhere for top picks:PE RatioA key metric that value investors always look at is the Price to Earnings Ratio, or PE for short. This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock, and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world. The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock’s current PE ratio with: a) where this ratio has been in the past; b) how it compares to the average for the industry/sector; and c) how it compares to the market as a whole.On this front, Weyerhaeuser has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 8.66, as you can see in the chart below:Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchThis level actually compares pretty favorably with the market at large, as the PE for the S&amp;P 500 stands at about 17.45. If we focus on the long-term PE trend, Weyerhaeuser’s current PE level puts it below its midpoint over the past five years.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchFurther, the stock’s PE compares favorably with the Zacks Construction sector’s trailing twelve months PE ratio, which stands at 10.14. At the very least, this indicates that the stock is relatively undervalued right now, compared to its peers.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchWe should also point out that Weyerhaeuser has a forward PE ratio (price relative to this year’s earnings) of just 9.56, which is tad higher than the current level. So it is fair to expect an increase in the company’s share price in the near term.Story continuesP/S RatioAnother key metric to note is the Price/Sales ratio. This approach compares a given stock’s price to its total sales, where a lower reading is generally considered better. Some people like this metric more than other value-focused ones because it looks at sales, something that is far harder to manipulate with accounting tricks than earnings.Right now, Weyerhaeuser has a P/S ratio of about 2.1. This is lower than the S&amp;P 500 average, which comes in at 3.49 right now.  Also, as we can see in the chart below, this is below the highs for this stock in particular over the past few years.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchIf anything, WY is in the lower end of its range in the time period from a P/S metric, suggesting some level of undervalued trading—at least compared to historical norms.Broad Value Outlook In aggregate, Weyerhaeuser currently has a Zacks Value Score of A, putting it into the top 20% of all stocks we cover from this look. This makes Weyerhaeuser a solid choice for value investors. What About the Stock Overall? Though Weyerhaeuser might be a good choice for value investors, there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name. In particular, it is worth noting that the company has a Growth Score of F and a Momentum Score of C. This gives WY a Zacks VGM score — or its overarching fundamental grade — of A. (You can read more about the Zacks Style Scores here &gt;&gt;)Meanwhile, the company’s recent earnings estimates have been disappointing. The current year has seen five estimates go higher in the past sixty days compared to three lower, while the full year 2021 estimate has seen three upward revision compared to one downward in the same time period.This has had a negative impact on the consensus estimate though as the current year consensus estimate has declined by 19.7% in the past two months, while the full year 2022 estimate has fallen by 1.4%. You can see the consensus estimate trend and recent price action for the stock in the chart below:Weyerhaeuser Company Price and ConsensusWeyerhaeuser Company Price and ConsensusWeyerhaeuser Company price-consensus-chart | Weyerhaeuser Company QuoteDespite the bearish analyst sentiments, the stock holds a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). Thus, we are looking for in-line performance from the company in the near term.Bottom Line  Weyerhaeuser is an inspired choice for value investors, as it is hard to beat its incredible line up of statistics on this front.However, with a sluggish industry rank (among bottom 35% of more than 250 industries) and a Zacks Rank #3, it is hard to get too excited about this company overall. In fact, over the past two years, the Zacks Building Products - Wood industry has clearly underperformed the market at large, as you can see below:Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchSo, value investors might want to wait for estimates and analyst sentiment to turn around in this name first, but once that happens, this stock could be a compelling pick.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

327,3c5458ed-d637-332c-bb85-cdab66c84e0b,INTU,2022-09-23,Is Intuit Inc. (NASDAQ:INTU) Trading At A 39% Discount?,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/intuit-inc-nasdaq-intu-trading-110016692.html,1663930816,STORY,['INTU'],"[Today we will run through one way of estimating the intrinsic value of Intuit Inc. (NASDAQ:INTU) by estimating the company's future cash flows and discounting them to their present value. This will be done using the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model. There's really not all that much to it, even though it might appear quite complex.Remember though, that there are many ways to estimate a company's value, and a DCF is just one method. Anyone interested in learning a bit more about intrinsic value should have a read of the Simply Wall St analysis model. Check out our latest analysis for Intuit Step By Step Through The CalculationWe're using the 2-stage growth model, which simply means we take in account two stages of company's growth. In the initial period the company may have a higher growth rate and the second stage is usually assumed to have a stable growth rate. To start off with, we need to estimate the next ten years of cash flows. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.Generally we assume that a dollar today is more valuable than a dollar in the future, and so the sum of these future cash flows is then discounted to today's value:10-year free cash flow (FCF) forecast2023202420252026202720282029203020312032 Levered FCF ($, Millions) US$4.10bUS$5.02bUS$5.70bUS$6.75bUS$7.71bUS$8.42bUS$9.01bUS$9.50bUS$9.92bUS$10.3bGrowth Rate Estimate SourceAnalyst x8Analyst x7Analyst x4Analyst x1Analyst x1Est @ 9.17%Est @ 7%Est @ 5.48%Est @ 4.42%Est @ 3.68% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 6.3% US$3.9kUS$4.4kUS$4.7kUS$5.3kUS$5.7kUS$5.8kUS$5.9kUS$5.8kUS$5.7kUS$5.6k(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$53bStory continuesWe now need to calculate the Terminal Value, which accounts for all the future cash flows after this ten year period. For a number of reasons a very conservative growth rate is used that cannot exceed that of a country's GDP growth. In this case we have used the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield (1.9%) to estimate future growth. In the same way as with the 10-year 'growth' period, we discount future cash flows to today's value, using a cost of equity of 6.3%.Terminal Value (TV)= FCF2032 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$10b× (1 + 1.9%) ÷ (6.3%– 1.9%) = US$239bPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$239b÷ ( 1 + 6.3%)10= US$130bThe total value is the sum of cash flows for the next ten years plus the discounted terminal value, which results in the Total Equity Value, which in this case is US$182b. The last step is to then divide the equity value by the number of shares outstanding. Compared to the current share price of US$397, the company appears quite undervalued at a 39% discount to where the stock price trades currently. The assumptions in any calculation have a big impact on the valuation, so it is better to view this as a rough estimate, not precise down to the last cent.dcfImportant AssumptionsWe would point out that the most important inputs to a discounted cash flow are the discount rate and of course the actual cash flows. You don't have to agree with these inputs, I recommend redoing the calculations yourself and playing with them. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Intuit as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 6.3%, which is based on a levered beta of 1.033. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.Moving On:Whilst important, the DCF calculation shouldn't be the only metric you look at when researching a company. The DCF model is not a perfect stock valuation tool. Preferably you'd apply different cases and assumptions and see how they would impact the company's valuation. If a company grows at a different rate, or if its cost of equity or risk free rate changes sharply, the output can look very different. Can we work out why the company is trading at a discount to intrinsic value? For Intuit, we've compiled three relevant factors you should assess:Risks: For example, we've discovered 2 warning signs for Intuit that you should be aware of before investing here.Management:Have insiders been ramping up their shares to take advantage of the market's sentiment for INTU's future outlook?

""People are focused not just on top-line growth, like they were for the past few years, but also bottom-line growth. ... It’s obviously a more measured environment, but I think technology is the solution.""Salesforce put its money where its mouth is at the conference, committing to a 25% operating margin by calendar year 2025. It's the first time Salesforce has committed to a public operating margin target — if hit, it would mark a notable increase from 2022's goal of 20.4%.The company also sees sales hitting $50 billion by 2025, compared to Wall Street estimates for this year of $31 billion.Marc Benioff, chairman and CEO of Salesforce speaks at the Wall Street Journal Digital Live conference at the Montage hotel in Laguna Beach, California October 20, 2015. REUTERS/Mike BlakeAll of this caught the attention of Goldman Sachs software analyst Kash Ranga, who was on the ground at Dreamforce meeting with Salesforce customers.Rangan is subsequently out on Thursday with one of the more bullish calls on Salesforce on Wall Street:Price Target: $320 (reiteration)Rating: Buy (reiterated)Stock price movement assumed: +113%Where Rangan's head is at on Salesforce overall:""The co-CEO structure under Marc Benioff and Bret Taylor appears to be working well and the management team overall seems to be unified in its strategy to balance growth and profitability. Looking beyond fiscal year 2026, we see operating margin potential of 35-40%. The broader take away is that digital transformation continues to be top of mind for customers at its annual Dreamforce user conference, which has more than 40K paid attendees. Newly-promoted President and COO Brian Millham made a reassuring point that the pipeline of potential business continues to look very promising.""Story continuesRangan added that ""Salesforce continues to invest in organic innovation exemplified by the release of Genie, a real-time customer data platform. Overall, Salesforce ranks high in Goldman Sachs’ framework for investing in software.""Inside Salesforce upbeat long-term guidance:""As Salesforce leans into several operating levers in their model to index towards this profitability, we see this potentially re-rating the company’s valuation multiple higher longer term, as was the case with Microsoft, Adobe, AutoDesk and Intuit. We were encouraged by CFO Amy Weaver’s commitment to this target, even if the company decides to participate in M&amp;A. We point to Salesforce's ability to show margin expansion over the last twelve months, despite the integration of Slack, and its reiteration of its FY23 margin targets despite top-line headwinds as proof points to its ability to execute on these long-term targets.""The Goldman analyst added that ""while the path to this level of profitability is not likely to be linear given necessary go-to-market and product investments, we are reassured by the cadence this guide suggests off of its fiscal year 2023 outlook for 20.4% margins.""Watch the performance of acquired assets Slack, Mulesoft, and Tableau:""We highlight Salesforce being able to drive innovation and growth through its acquired assets. We see more potential for growth to be driven by Slack, which was acquired at a 27x revenue multiple ($1.1 billion) and today has grown 1.4x to ~$1.5 bilion in revenues. We believe this is still in the early stages of product adoption and innovation within the Salesforce ecosystem, with key new features announced just this week (more below).

Shares have lost about 12.3% in that time frame, underperforming the S&amp;P 500.Will the recent negative trend continue leading up to its next earnings release, or is Intuit due for a breakout? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at its most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important drivers.Intuit’s Earnings and Revenues Surpass Estimates in Q4Intuit reported fiscal fourth-quarter non-GAAP earnings of $1.10 per share, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 98 cents per share. The bottom line plunged 44% from the year-ago quarter’s earnings of $1.97 per share.Revenues of $2.41 billion surpassed the consensus mark of $2.35 billion but dropped 6% year over year.Quarter in DetailSegment-wise, Small Business and Self-Employed Group revenues grew 41% year over year to $1.77 billion. This rise was driven by the solid growth in customers for QuickBooks Online and a favorable mix-shift.Total Online Ecosystem revenues surged 66% year over year to $1.28 billion. QuickBooks Online Accounting revenues were up 34% year over year to $623 million, mainly driven by the mix-shift, higher pricing and customer growth.Online Services revenues, which include payroll, payments, time tracking and capital, soared 116% year over year to $657 million. This was driven by strong performances of the QuickBooks Online payroll and QuickBooks Online payments solutions, along with revenues from the new Mailchimp business.Within the QuickBooks Online payroll, a mix-shift to INTU’s full-service offering and the continued uptick in the customer base acted as tailwinds. Within the payments, an increase in the charge volume per customer and ongoing customer growth drove revenues. Mailchimp contributed $265 million to total Online Services.Total International online revenues increased a whopping 193% year over year on a constant-currency basis and 23% on an organic basis, excluding contributions from Mailchimp.Story continuesTotal Desktop ecosystem revenues grew 1.5% year over year during the reported quarter to $489 million.In the fiscal fourth quarter, revenues from Consumer Group decreased to $145 million from $852 billion reported a year ago, mainly driven by the earlier Internal Revenue Service (IRS) deadline this year. IRS income tax returns filing deadline was Apr 18, 2022.ProConnect Group's professional tax revenues decreased to $25 million from $52 million in the year-ago quarter. The decrease reflected the earlier IRS opening this year.The Credit Karma business contributed $475 million to Intuit’s fourth-quarter total revenues, up from $405 million in the year-ago quarter. The robust year-over-year growth reflects high levels of monthly active users and revenues per monthly active user. It reflects strength in credit cards and personal loans.Intuit’s non-GAAP operating income decreased 39% to $433 million.Fiscal 2022 HighlightsIntuit’s fiscal 2022 revenues grew 32% year over year to $12.73 billion and surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $12.66 billion. Excluding Mailchimp, INTU revenues went up 24%.The company reported non-GAAP earnings of $11.85 per share, which outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $11.72 per share and grew 22% from the year-ago quarter.In fiscal 2022, INTU’s non-GAAP operating income rose 29% to $4.50 billion.Balance Sheet and Cash FlowAs of Jul 31, 2022, Intuit’s cash and investments were $3.28 billion compared with $3.90 billion as of Apr 30, 2022.The company exited the fourth quarter with long-term debt of $6.42 billion, down from the previous quarter’s $6.85 billion.During fiscal 2022, Intuit generated operating cash flow worth $3.89 billion.Intuit repurchased stocks worth $508 million during the reported quarter and $1.9 billion during the fiscal year. At the end of the quarter, it had a remaining share-repurchase authorization of $3.5 billion. Additionally, INTU announced that its board approved a quarterly cash dividend of 78 cents per share payable on Oct 18, 2022. The newly approved cash dividend represents a year-over-year increase of 15%.OutlookIntuit projects fiscal 2023 revenues in the band of $14.485-$14.700 billion, indicating 14-16% growth.The company anticipates non-GAAP operating income between $5.258 billion and $5.363 billion, indicating approximate year-over-year growth of 17-19%.Intuit’s fiscal 2023 non-GAAP earnings per share forecast stands between $13.59 and $13.89, suggesting a year-over-year increase of 15-17%.For the fiscal first quarter, INTU expects revenues to grow between 23% and 25% on a year-over-year basis. Adjusted earnings for the quarter are estimated in the range of $1.14-$1.20 per share.How Have Estimates Been Moving Since Then?It turns out, fresh estimates have trended downward during the past month.The consensus estimate has shifted -92.89% due to these changes.VGM ScoresCurrently, Intuit has an average Growth Score of C, though it is lagging a lot on the Momentum Score front with an F. Charting a somewhat similar path, the stock was allocated a grade of D on the value side, putting it in the bottom 40% for this investment strategy.Overall, the stock has an aggregate VGM Score of D. If you aren't focused on one strategy, this score is the one you should be interested in.OutlookEstimates have been broadly trending downward for the stock, and the magnitude of these revisions indicates a downward shift. Notably, Intuit has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). We expect an in-line return from the stock in the next few months.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Since 2019, more than two dozen cities have passed measures to reduce the use of gas in buildings, and last week the state's utilities regulator eliminated subsidies for extending natural gas lines to new homes or commercial buildings.Buildings are responsible for about 5% of the state's nitrogen oxides emissions due to natural gas combustion, according to CARB. They also account for about a quarter of the greenhouse gas emissions that contribute to climate change.Under the plan adopted on Thursday, CARB will develop standards for space and water heaters. New equipment sold beginning in 2030 will have to meet those standards. The rule is expected to rely heavily on heat pumps, which use electricity for heating, according to a staff report published last month.Environmental group RMI estimated that the zero emissions standards would reduce 154 million metric tons of climate-warming emissions, equivalent to 19 million homes' annual energy use, in their first 15 years.SoCalGas, the state's largest gas utility and a unite of Sempra Energy, said it supported the state's goal to decarbonize buildings and said its own infrastructure would play a role by transporting clean fuels such as hydrogen.""A growing body of research shows that electrification combined with clean fuels and carbon management deliver the most affordable, resilient, and technologically proven path to improved air quality and full carbon neutrality,"" Christine Detz, a SoCalGas spokesperson, said in an email.

338,0a881066-6e20-3e86-8364-a5c96a9b579b,EL,2022-09-23,"Estée Lauder Companies (NYSE:EL) sheds 4.0% this week, as yearly returns fall more in line with earnings growth",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/est-e-lauder-companies-nyse-120048477.html,1663934448,STORY,['EL'],"[The Estée Lauder Companies Inc. (NYSE:EL) shareholders might be concerned after seeing the share price drop 13% in the last quarter. But that scarcely detracts from the really solid long term returns generated by the company over five years. We think most investors would be happy with the 121% return, over that period. So while it's never fun to see a share price fall, it's important to look at a longer time horizon. Ultimately business performance will determine whether the stock price continues the positive long term trend. Unfortunately not all shareholders will have held it for the long term, so spare a thought for those caught in the 27% decline over the last twelve months.While the stock has fallen 4.0% this week, it's worth focusing on the longer term and seeing if the stocks historical returns have been driven by the underlying fundamentals. Check out our latest analysis for Estée Lauder Companies There is no denying that markets are sometimes efficient, but prices do not always reflect underlying business performance. One way to examine how market sentiment has changed over time is to look at the interaction between a company's share price and its earnings per share (EPS).Over half a decade, Estée Lauder Companies managed to grow its earnings per share at 15% a year. So the EPS growth rate is rather close to the annualized share price gain of 17% per year. Therefore one could conclude that sentiment towards the shares hasn't morphed very much. Rather, the share price has approximately tracked EPS growth.The graphic below depicts how EPS has changed over time (unveil the exact values by clicking on the image).earnings-per-share-growthIt might be well worthwhile taking a look at our free report on Estée Lauder Companies' earnings, revenue and cash flow.What About Dividends?It is important to consider the total shareholder return, as well as the share price return, for any given stock. The TSR incorporates the value of any spin-offs or discounted capital raisings, along with any dividends, based on the assumption that the dividends are reinvested. So for companies that pay a generous dividend, the TSR is often a lot higher than the share price return. We note that for Estée Lauder Companies the TSR over the last 5 years was 131%, which is better than the share price return mentioned above. This is largely a result of its dividend payments!Story continuesA Different PerspectiveWe regret to report that Estée Lauder Companies shareholders are down 26% for the year (even including dividends). Unfortunately, that's worse than the broader market decline of 20%. However, it could simply be that the share price has been impacted by broader market jitters. It might be worth keeping an eye on the fundamentals, in case there's a good opportunity. On the bright side, long term shareholders have made money, with a gain of 18% per year over half a decade. It could be that the recent sell-off is an opportunity, so it may be worth checking the fundamental data for signs of a long term growth trend. I find it very interesting to look at share price over the long term as a proxy for business performance. But to truly gain insight, we need to consider other information, too. Consider for instance, the ever-present spectre of investment risk.   We've identified 1 warning sign  with Estée Lauder Companies , and understanding them should be part of your investment process.Of course, you might find a fantastic investment by looking elsewhere.

And then in order to say what they're worth, we take the present value of those, which you will use a discount rate … and that's what makes all boats rise and decline together.”So where should investors hide?Cash is obviously not optimal as inflation erodes its purchasing power. Dalio previously said that “cash is trash” and he still believes so.“Cash is still going to be a negative real return, it's still going to be a trashy investment depends how it compares with the others.”Let’s take a look at what Dalio’s hedge fund holds instead.Procter &amp; Gamble (PG)According to Bridgewater’s latest 13F filing to the SEC, the fund held 6.75 million shares of Procter &amp; Gamble at the end of June. With a market value of around $970 million at the time, it was the largest holding in Dalio’s portfolio.This shouldn’t come as a surprise. P&amp;G is a defensive stock with the ability to deliver cash returns to investors in different economic environments.In April, P&amp;G’s board announced a 5% dividend increase, marking the company’s 66th consecutive annual payout increase. The stock currently offers an annual dividend yield of 2.7%.Story continuesIt’s easy to see why the company is able to maintain such a streak.P&amp;G is a consumer staples giant with a portfolio of trusted brands like Bounty paper towels, Crest toothpaste, Gillette razor blades, and Tide detergent. These are products that households buy on a regular basis, regardless of what the economy is doing.Johnson &amp; Johnson (JNJ)With deeply entrenched positions in consumer health, pharmaceuticals and medical devices markets, healthcare giant Johnson &amp; Johnson has delivered consistent returns to investors throughout economic cycles.Many of the company’s consumer health brands — such as Tylenol, Band-Aid, and Listerine — are household names. In total, JNJ has 29 products each capable of generating over $1 billion in annual sales.Not only does Johnson &amp; Johnson post recurring annual profits, but it also grows them consistently: Over the past 20 years, Johnson &amp; Johnson’s adjusted earnings have increased at an average annual rate of 8%.JNJ announced its 60th consecutive annual dividend increase in April and now yields 2.7%.As of June 30, Bridgewater held 4.33 million shares of JNJ, worth approximately $769 million at the time and making the healthcare giant its second-largest holding.iShares Core MSCI Emerging Markets ETF (IEMG)Bridgewater’s third-largest holding is the iShares Core MSCI Emerging Markets ETF.IEMG tracks the MSCI Emerging Markets Investable Market Index and provides investors with convenient exposure to stocks in emerging markets like China, India, and Brazil.The ETF holds more than 2,600 stocks. Its top holdings include industry heavyweights like chipmaking giant Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing, Chinese tech behemoth Tencent Holdings, and Indian multinational conglomerate Reliance Industries.In a conversation with another investing legend Jeremy Grantham earlier this year, Dalio said he’s looking at countries with good income statements and balance sheets that can weather the storm.“Emerging Asia is very interesting. India is interesting,” he says.Bridgewater held 15.31 million shares of IEMG at the end of Q2, valued at $751 million.What to read nextSign up for our MoneyWise investing newsletter to receive a steady flow of actionable ideas from Wall Street's top firms.Warren Buffett likes these 2 investment opportunities outside of the stock marketA Wells Fargo study shows that nearly half of Americans are leaning on their credit card rewards to help offset some of the costs of everyday purchasesThis article provides information only and should not be construed as advice.

And out of all of the metrics and results to consider, earnings is one of the most important.The earnings figure itself is key, but a beat or miss on the bottom line can sometimes be just as, if not more, important. Therefore, investors should consider paying close attention to these earnings surprises, as a big beat can help a stock climb even higher.2 Stocks to Add to Your WatchlistThe Zacks Expected Surprise Prediction, or ESP, works by locking in on the most up-to-date analyst earnings revisions because they can be more accurate than estimates from weeks or even months before the actual release date. The thinking is pretty straightforward: analysts who provide earnings estimates closer to the report are likely to have more information. With this in mind, the Expected Surprise Prediction compares the Most Accurate Estimate (being the most recent) against the overall Zacks Consensus Estimate. The percentage difference provides the ESP figure.Now that we understand what the ESP is and how beneficial it can be, let's dive into a stock that currently fits the bill. Crown Castle (CCI) earns a Zacks Rank #3 right now and its Most Accurate Estimate sits at $1.84 a share, just 27 days from its upcoming earnings release on October 19, 2022.Crown Castle's Earnings ESP sits at 0.64%, which, as explained above, is calculated by taking the percentage difference between the $1.84 Most Accurate Estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.83.CCI is part of a big group of Finance stocks that boast a positive ESP, and investors may want to take a look at SL Green (SLG) as well.Slated to report earnings on October 19, 2022, SL Green holds a #3 (Hold) ranking on the Zacks Rank, and it's Most Accurate Estimate is $1.66 a share 27 days from its next quarterly update.Story continuesFor SL Green, the percentage difference between its Most Accurate Estimate and its Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.65 is 0.57%.CCI and SLG's positive ESP metrics may signal that a positive earnings surprise for both stocks is on the horizon.Find Stocks to Buy or Sell Before They're ReportedUse the Zacks Earnings ESP Filter to turn up stocks with the highest probability of positively, or negatively, surprising to buy or sell before they're reported for profitable earnings season trading.

Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: NextEra Energy Inc. NEE, The Southern Co. SO, PepsiCo Inc. PEP, Corteva Inc. CTVA and McKesson Corp. MCK.Here are highlights from Thursday’s Analyst Blog:Bet on These 5 Ultra-Defensive Stocks for the Rest of 2022On Sep 21, the Fed raised the benchmark interest rate by 75 basis points in the third consecutive FOMC meeting. With this, the Fed Fund rate jumped to the range of 3-3.25% from a mere 0-0.25% in early March. The central bank has hiked the interest rate by 3% so far in 2022.Such a rigorous rate hike has happened for the first time since 1990, when the central bank recognized the Fed Fund rate as the principal monetary policy tool. This is not the end. What is alarming is that the central bank has projected more toughness for the rest of 2022 and 2023.Consequently, Wall Street melted on Sep 21, with the three major stock indexes — the Dow, the S&amp;P 500 and the Nasdaq Composite — falling 1.7%, 1.7% and 1.8%, respectively. At this juncture, defensive sectors like utilities, consumer staples and health care will be best bets.Further, we need to select those stocks from those sectors that have a low beta and good dividend yield in order to counter extreme volatility. Five such stocks with a favorable Zacks Rank are — NextEra Energy Inc., The Southern Co., PepsiCo Inc., Corteva Inc. and McKesson Corp.Fed Provides a Grim OutlookThe U.S. stock markets have been witnessing extreme volatility in 2022. Inflation has soared to a 40-year high and in order to combat mounting inflation, the Fed has adopted an ultra-hawkish monetary stance. Year to date, the Dow, the S&amp;P 500 and the Nasdaq Composite – have plunged 16.9%, 20.5% and 28.3%, respectively.Story continuesA large section of economists and financial experts were expecting that the September FOMC meeting would be the last one for a 75 basis point rate hike. However, the Fed has raised the median of the Fed Fund rate to 4.4% in September from 3.4% in June.This means, the range of the benchmark lending rate at the end of 2022 will be 4.25-4.5%, indicating 75 basis-point and 50 basis-point interest rate hike in November and December, respectively.Market participants were expecting a rate cut in 2023, which is out of the question now as the central bank has projected that the median of the benchmark interest rate will reach 4.6% in 2023. This means another 50 basis-point rate hike throughout 2023. The first rate cut is not expected before 2024 as the Fed is expecting inflation to come down to its target rate of 2% in 2025.Investment analysts have estimated that there exists a 75% probability of the U.S. economy entering a recession either in the last quarter of 2022 or in the first quarter of 2023. The Fed has projected that the U.S. GDP will by a mere 0.2% in 2022 after contracting in the first two quarters. The projection for the unemployment rate has been scaled up to 4.4% by next year from the current projection of 3.7%.Our Top PicksWe have narrowed our search to five low-beta (beta value &gt; 0 &lt;1) high-yielding defensive stocks that have strong potential for the rest of 2022.

The $2.5 trillion tech company may have paid as much as $50 million a year for the five-year deal, Sportico reported, without saying where it got the information.The pricey sponsorship’s announcement also coincides with Apple’s bid for the rights to stream the NFL’s Sunday Night games. The company is considered the front-runner for the popular package of games, for which the league is seeking $2.5 billion, an increase of $1 billion over its current deal with DirecTV.Apple has generally stayed away from sponsorships, which are primarily a marketing tactic. Apple Music sponsored the German football club FC Bayern Munich for at least two years last decade. But the firm does have a long history with the Super Bowl: It’s been running ads during the event since 1984, when it first introduced the Apple Macintosh personal computer.PepsiCo announced in May it was ending its 10-year sponsorship run. The Super Bowl, the National Football League’s annual season-ending championship, is among the most-watched sporting events in the world.

PEP, Altria Group, Inc. MO, and Campbell Soup Company CPB – would all provide investors with a defense-heavy approach.Below is a chart illustrating the share performance of all three companies in 2022, with the S&amp;P 500 blended in as a benchmark.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchAs we can see, all three stocks have weathered a dark fiscal cloud better than most.Companies in the Zacks Consumer Staples Sector generate reliable, consistent revenue in the face of both good and bad economic times.For the cherry on top, all three stocks are classified as low-beta, further shielding investors from the market’s volatility.Let’s dive into each one.PepsiCo, Inc.PepsiCo is a long-established company engaged in the manufacturing, marketing, and distribution of grain-based snack foods, beverages, and other products.Undoubtedly a major positive, the beverage titan’s earnings outlook has turned visibly bright over the last several months, helping land the stock into a favorable Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchIt’s been a good year for the company; PepsiCo joined the elite Dividend King group earlier this year, displaying an exceptional commitment to shareholders.The company’s annual dividend yields a notable 2.7% paired with a five-year annualized dividend growth rate of 6.7%.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchFurther, PEP has a notably strong earnings track record, exceeding the Zacks Consensus EPS Estimate in nine of its last ten prints.Top-line results have also been robust, with the company exceeding the Zacks Consensus Sales Estimate in 16 consecutive quarters.Story continuesBelow is a chart illustrating the company's revenue on a quarterly basis.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchAltria Group, Inc.

FMX.Here are highlights from Wednesday’s Analyst Blog:3 Defensive Consumer Staple Stocks for Your PortfolioAn overall inflationary landscape and disrupted supply chain have been bad news for companies across most sectors. High input costs, including the cost of raw materials, packaging and logistics, are a common concern plaguing margins. Also, a tight labor market has led to a spike in wage costs. These headwinds have been weighing on companies’ performances.Amid such a scenario, the Consumer Staples sector – popularly known as the defensive zone – has been garnering attention. This is because demand for staples remains fairly stable when compared with discretionary categories, aiding companies in the space to withstand market turbulence. Even in the early phases of the pandemic, which had messed up operations of companies across most industries, players in the consumer staples space were riding on the burgeoning demand for essentials stemming from elevated at-home consumption and stock hoarding.No wonder the defensive Consumer Staples sector has always been a go-to place for investors, as it offers steady growth irrespective of the state of the economy. Adding stocks from the consumer staples basket lends more stability to portfolios in an uncertain market. These stocks make up for modest growth with dependable profits, lower price volatility and defensive positioning.All said, we have picked a few stocks from the Zacks Consumer Staples universe, which are well-positioned for growth on the back of their robust fundamentals and favorable demand.

355,827d7229-bc9a-3f84-97ed-b73061f0b381,PEP,2022-09-23,Bet on These 5 Ultra-Defensive Stocks for the Rest of 2022,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/bet-5-ultra-defensive-stocks-121612167.html,1663848972,STORY,"['CTVA', 'COMP', '^GSPC', 'NEE', 'MCK', 'PEP', 'SO']","[On Sep 21, the Fed raised the benchmark interest rate by 75 basis points in the third consecutive FOMC meeting. With this, the Fed Fund rate jumped to the range of 3-3.25% from a mere 0-0.25% in early March. The central bank has hiked the interest rate by 3% so far in 2022.Such a rigorous rate hike has happened for the first time since 1990, when the central bank recognized the Fed Fund rate as the principal monetary policy tool. This is not the end. What is alarming is that the central bank has projected more toughness for the rest of 2022 and 2023.Consequently, Wall Street melted on Sep 21, with the three major stock indexes — the Dow, the S&amp;P 500 and the Nasdaq Composite — falling 1.7%, 1.7% and 1.8%, respectively. At this juncture, defensive sectors like utilities, consumer staples and health care will be best bets.Further, we need to select those stocks from those sectors that have a low beta and good dividend yield in order to counter extreme volatility. Five such stocks with a favorable Zacks Rank are — NextEra Energy Inc. NEE, The Southern Co. SO, PepsiCo Inc. PEP, Corteva Inc. CTVA and McKesson Corp.MCK.Fed Provides a Grim OutlookThe U.S. stock markets have been witnessing extreme volatility in 2022. Inflation has soared to a 40-year high and in order to combat mounting inflation, the Fed has adopted an ultra-hawkish monetary stance. Year to date, the Dow, the S&amp;P 500 and the Nasdaq Composite – have plunged 16.9%, 20.5% and 28.3%, respectively.A large section of economists and financial experts were expecting that the September FOMC meeting would be the last one for a 75 basis point rate hike. However, the Fed has raised the median of the Fed Fund rate to 4.4% in September from 3.4% in June.This means, the range of the benchmark lending rate at the end of 2022 will be 4.25-4.5%, indicating 75 basis-point and 50 basis-point interest rate hike in November and December, respectively.Market participants were expecting a rate cut in 2023, which is out of the question now as the central bank has projected that the median of the benchmark interest rate will reach 4.6% in 2023. This means another 50 basis-point rate hike throughout 2023. The first rate cut is not expected before 2024 as the Fed is expecting inflation to come down to its target rate of 2% in 2025.Story continuesInvestment analysts have estimated that there exists 75% probability of the U.S. economy entering a recession either in the last quarter of 2022 or in the first quarter of 2023. The Fed has projected that the U.S. GDP will by a mere 0.2% in 2022 after contracting in the first two quarters. The projection for the unemployment rate has been scaled up to 4.4% by next year from the current projection of 3.7%.Our Top PicksWe have narrowed our search to five low-beta (beta value &gt; 0 &lt;1) high-yielding defensive stocks that have strong potential for the rest of 2022.

(NASDAQ:REGN) insiders disposed of US$16m worth of stock",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/possible-bearish-signals-regeneron-pharmaceuticals-120100692.html,1663934460,STORY,['REGN'],"[In the last year, many Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (NASDAQ:REGN) insiders sold a substantial stake in the company which may have sparked shareholders' attention. When analyzing insider transactions, it is usually more valuable to know whether insiders are buying versus knowing if they are selling, as the latter sends an ambiguous message. However, if numerous insiders are selling, shareholders should investigate more.Although we don't think shareholders should simply follow insider transactions, we do think it is perfectly logical to keep tabs on what insiders are doing. See our latest analysis for Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Insider Transactions Over The Last YearIn the last twelve months, the biggest single sale by an insider was when the Independent Director, George Sing, sold US$7.0m worth of shares at a price of US$660 per share. That means that an insider was selling shares at slightly below the current price (US$688). We generally consider it a negative if insiders have been selling, especially if they did so below the current price, because it implies that they considered a lower price to be reasonable. Please do note, however, that sellers may have a variety of reasons for selling, so we don't know for sure what they think of the stock price. We note that the biggest single sale was only 23% of George Sing's holding.Regeneron Pharmaceuticals insiders didn't buy any shares over the last year. You can see the insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last year depicted in the chart below. If you click on the chart, you can see all the individual transactions, including the share price, individual, and the date!insider-trading-volumeIf you are like me, then you will not want to miss this free list of growing companies that insiders are buying.Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Insiders Are Selling The StockThe last three months saw significant insider selling at Regeneron Pharmaceuticals. Specifically, Independent Director Arthur Ryan ditched US$4.3m worth of shares in that time, and we didn't record any purchases whatsoever. Overall this makes us a bit cautious, but it's not the be all and end all.Story continuesDoes Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Boast High Insider Ownership?I like to look at how many shares insiders own in a company, to help inform my view of how aligned they are with insiders. Usually, the higher the insider ownership, the more likely it is that insiders will be incentivised to build the company for the long term. Regeneron Pharmaceuticals insiders own 4.2% of the company, currently worth about US$3.1b based on the recent share price. Most shareholders would be happy to see this sort of insider ownership, since it suggests that management incentives are well aligned with other shareholders.So What Does This Data Suggest About Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Insiders?An insider hasn't bought Regeneron Pharmaceuticals stock in the last three months, but there was some selling. Looking to the last twelve months, our data doesn't show any insider buying. While insiders do own a lot of shares in the company (which is good), our analysis of their transactions doesn't make us feel confident about the company. While we like knowing what's going on with the insider's ownership and transactions, we make sure to also consider what risks are facing a stock before making any investment decision. In terms of investment risks, we've identified 2 warning signs with Regeneron Pharmaceuticals and understanding these should be part of your investment process.If you would prefer to check out another company -- one with potentially superior financials -- then do not miss this free list of interesting companies, that have HIGH return on equity and low debt.For the purposes of this article, insiders are those individuals who report their transactions to the relevant regulatory body.

This has was narrower than the Computer and Technology sector's loss of 13.48% and lagged the S&amp;P 500's loss of 10.24% in that time.Wall Street will be looking for positivity from Cisco Systems as it approaches its next earnings report date. In that report, analysts expect Cisco Systems to post earnings of $0.84 per share. This would mark year-over-year growth of 2.44%. Meanwhile, our latest consensus estimate is calling for revenue of $13.31 billion, up 3.2% from the prior-year quarter.CSCO's full-year Zacks Consensus Estimates are calling for earnings of $3.53 per share and revenue of $54.07 billion.
