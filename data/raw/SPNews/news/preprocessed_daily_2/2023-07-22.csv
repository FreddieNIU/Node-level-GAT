With 70% stake, institutions possess the maximum shares in the company. In other words, the group stands to gain the most (or lose the most) from their investment into the company.And as as result, institutional investors reaped the most rewards after the company's stock price gained 14% last week. One-year return to shareholders is currently 7.1% and last week’s gain was the icing on the cake.Let's take a closer look to see what the different types of shareholders can tell us about Charles Schwab. View our latest analysis for Charles Schwab ownership-breakdownWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Charles Schwab?Many institutions measure their performance against an index that approximates the local market. So they usually pay more attention to companies that are included in major indices.We can see that Charles Schwab does have institutional investors; and they hold a good portion of the company's stock. This can indicate that the company has a certain degree of credibility in the investment community. However, it is best to be wary of relying on the supposed validation that comes with institutional investors. They too, get it wrong sometimes. It is not uncommon to see a big share price drop if two large institutional investors try to sell out of a stock at the same time. So it is worth checking the past earnings trajectory of Charles Schwab, (below). Of course, keep in mind that there are other factors to consider, too.earnings-and-revenue-growthSince institutional investors own more than half the issued stock, the board will likely have to pay attention to their preferences. Charles Schwab is not owned by hedge funds. Looking at our data, we can see that the largest shareholder is The Toronto-Dominion Bank with 12% of shares outstanding. With 7.0% and 5.8% of the shares outstanding respectively, The Vanguard Group, Inc. and BlackRock, Inc. are the second and third largest shareholders.Story continuesA closer look at our ownership figures suggests that the top 18 shareholders have a combined ownership of 50% implying that no single shareholder has a majority.While studying institutional ownership for a company can add value to your research, it is also a good practice to research analyst recommendations to get a deeper understand of a stock's expected performance. There are plenty of analysts covering the stock, so it might be worth seeing what they are forecasting, too.Insider Ownership Of Charles SchwabThe definition of company insiders can be subjective and does vary between jurisdictions. Our data reflects individual insiders, capturing board members at the very least. Company management run the business, but the CEO will answer to the board, even if he or she is a member of it.I generally consider insider ownership to be a good thing. However, on some occasions it makes it more difficult for other shareholders to hold the board accountable for decisions.We can see that insiders own shares in The Charles Schwab Corporation. The insiders have a meaningful stake worth US$1.7b. we sometimes take an interest in  whether they have been buying or selling. General Public OwnershipWith a 12% ownership, the general public, mostly comprising of individual investors, have some degree of sway over Charles Schwab. While this group can't necessarily call the shots, it can certainly have a real influence on how the company is run.Private Company OwnershipIt seems that Private Companies own 4.4%, of the Charles Schwab stock. It might be worth looking deeper into this. If related parties, such as insiders, have an interest in one of these private companies, that should be disclosed in the annual report. Private companies may also have a strategic interest in the company.Public Company OwnershipPublic companies currently own 12% of Charles Schwab stock. It's hard to say for sure but this suggests they have entwined business interests. This might be a strategic stake, so it's worth watching this space for changes in ownership.Next Steps:It's always worth thinking about the different groups who own shares in a company. But to understand Charles Schwab better, we need to consider many other factors.I always like to check for a history of revenue growth. You can too, by accessing this free chart of historic revenue and earnings in this detailed graph.If you are like me, you may want to think about whether this company will grow or shrink. Luckily, you can check this free report showing analyst forecasts for its future.NB: Figures in this article are calculated using data from the last twelve months, which refer to the 12-month period ending on the last date of the month the financial statement is dated.

It has amassed assets over $19.76 billion, making it one of the largest ETFs attempting to match the Large Cap Growth segment of the US equity market.Why Large Cap GrowthLarge cap companies usually have a market capitalization above $10 billion. Considered a more stable option, large cap companies boast more predictable cash flows and are less volatile than their mid and small cap counterparts.Qualities of growth stocks include faster growth rates compared to the broader market, as well as higher valuations and higher than average sales and earnings growth rates. Something to keep in mind is the higher level of volatility that is affiliated with growth stocks. They are likely to outperform value stocks in strong bull markets but over the longer-term, value stocks have delivered better returns than growth stocks in almost all markets.CostsSince cheaper funds tend to produce better results than more expensive funds, assuming all other factors remain equal, it is important for investors to pay attention to an ETF's expense ratio.Annual operating expenses for this ETF are 0.04%, making it one of the least expensive products in the space.It has a 12-month trailing dividend yield of 0.44%.Sector Exposure and Top HoldingsEven though ETFs offer diversified exposure that minimizes single stock risk, investors should also look at the actual holdings inside the fund. Luckily, most ETFs are very transparent products that disclose their holdings on a daily basis.This ETF has heaviest allocation to the Information Technology sector--about 45.70% of the portfolio. Healthcare and Consumer Discretionary round out the top three.Looking at individual holdings, Apple Inc (AAPL) accounts for about 13.96% of total assets, followed by Microsoft Corp (MSFT) and Amazon Com Inc (AMZN).Story continuesThe top 10 holdings account for about 52.33% of total assets under management.Performance and RiskSCHG seeks to match the performance of the Dow Jones U.S. Large-Cap Growth Total Stock Market Index before fees and expenses. The Dow Jones U.S. Large-Cap Growth Total Stock Market Index is float-adjusted market-capitalization weighted and includes the large-cap growth portion of the Dow Jones U.S. Total Stock Market Index.The ETF has gained about 37.95% so far this year and it's up approximately 23.07% in the last one year (as of 07/21/2023). In the past 52-week period, it has traded between $54.19 and $78.02.The ETF has a beta of 1.09 and standard deviation of 24.29% for the trailing three-year period, making it a medium risk choice in the space. With about 246 holdings, it effectively diversifies company-specific risk.AlternativesSchwab U.S. Large-Cap Growth ETF holds a Zacks ETF Rank of 2 (Buy), which is based on expected asset class return, expense ratio, and momentum, among other factors. Because of this, SCHG is an excellent option for investors seeking exposure to the Style Box - Large Cap Growth segment of the market. There are other additional ETFs in the space that investors could consider as well.The Vanguard Growth ETF (VUG) and the Invesco QQQ (QQQ) track a similar index. While Vanguard Growth ETF has $94.17 billion in assets, Invesco QQQ has $209.99 billion. VUG has an expense ratio of 0.04% and QQQ charges 0.20%.Bottom-LineWhile an excellent vehicle for long term investors, passively managed ETFs are a popular choice among institutional and retail investors due to their low costs, transparency, flexibility, and tax efficiency.To learn more about this product and other ETFs, screen for products that match your investment objectives and read articles on latest developments in the ETF investing universe, please visit Zacks ETF Center.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

That is because the Jan 19, 2024 $2 Call had some of the highest implied volatility of all equity options today.What is Implied Volatility?Implied volatility shows how much movement the market is expecting in the future. Options with high levels of implied volatility suggest that investors in the underlying stocks are expecting a big move in one direction or the other. It could also mean there is an event coming up soon that may cause a big rally or a huge sell-off. However, implied volatility is only one piece of the puzzle when putting together an options trading strategy.What do the Analysts Think?Clearly, options traders are pricing in a big move for Range Resources shares, but what is the fundamental picture for the company? Currently, Range Resources is a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) in the Oil and Gas - Exploration and Production - United States industry that ranks in the Bottom 9% of our Zacks Industry Rank. Over the last 30 days, no analysts have increased their earnings estimates for the current quarter, while six analysts have revised their estimates downward. The net effect has taken our Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current quarter from 31 cents per share to 25 cents in that period.Given the way analysts feel about Range Resources right now, this huge implied volatility could mean there’s a trade developing. Oftentimes, options traders look for options with high levels of implied volatility to sell premium. This is a strategy many seasoned traders use because it captures decay. At expiration, the hope for these traders is that the underlying stock does not move as much as originally expected.Looking to Trade Options?Check out the simple yet high-powered approach that Zacks Executive VP Kevin Matras has used to close recent double and triple-digit winners.

It has a trailing four-quarter earnings surprise of 10.8%, on average. It posted an earnings surprise of 16.8% in the last reported quarter. Strong performance in the steel mills unit is likely to have supported second-quarter performance. Its results are also likely to reflect the impact of improved selling prices.Nucor’s shares are up 29.2% over a year, compared with the industry’s 45% rise. Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchLet’s see how things are shaping up for this announcement. What do the Estimates Say?Nucor, last month, issued its earnings guidance for the second quarter. It anticipates second-quarter earnings in the range of $5.45-$5.55 per share.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for second-quarter consolidated revenues for Nucor is currently pegged at $9,734 million, reflecting a year-over-year decline of 17.5%.A Few Factors to WatchImproved profitability in the company’s steel mills segment is expected to be aided its performance in the quarter to be reported. Volumes in this segment is likely to have been supported by healthy underlying demand in end markets. Our estimate for sales tons to outside customers for steel mills is pegged at 4,925,000 tons for the second quarter compared with 4,804,000 tons reported in the prior quarter.Nucor, in June, said that it sees enhanced earnings performance in the steel mills segment in the second quarter compared with the previous quarter mainly due to margin expansion at its sheet mills. The company’s steel products segment is also projected to maintain strong performance, comparable to the first quarter of 2023.The company also expects improved performance of its DRI facilities to drive profitability in the raw materials segment. It sees profits to be up sequentially for this segment.Meanwhile, U.S. steel prices have rebounded this year after tumbling in the fourth quarter of 2022. The benchmark hot-rolled coil prices have recovered, driven by U.S. steel mills’ price hike actions, low import levels, supply tightness partly due to mill outages and a recovery in demand.Sequentially higher selling prices are likely to have supported Nucor’s performance in the to-be-reported quarter. Our estimate for second-quarter average sales price per ton for the company’s steel mills unit stands at $1,088, suggesting a 5.1% sequential increase.Story continues Nucor Corporation Price and EPS Surprise Nucor Corporation Price and EPS SurpriseNucor Corporation price-eps-surprise | Nucor Corporation Quote Zacks ModelOur proven model does not conclusively predict an earnings beat for Nucor this season.

Investors think so.,Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/is-the-regional-banking-crisis-really-over-now-investors-think-so-115711905.html,1690027031,STORY,"['TFC', 'USB', 'USB-PR', 'ZION', 'WAL', 'WAL-PA', 'PNC', 'CFG', 'CFG-PD', 'CFG-PE', '^BKX', 'FITB', 'FITBP']","[Four months ago, Western Alliance (WAL) was in the throes of a crisis as depositors fled after the fall of Silicon Valley Bank. This week, executives made it sound like that drama was in the past.""I don’t think there’s any permanent damage done,"" CEO Kenneth Vecchione told analysts after reporting that deposits at the Phoenix-based bank had risen 7% in the second quarter and would likely rise again in the third.Investors liked what they heard, even though profits fell. Western Alliance's stock surged nearly 8% the next day and ended the full week with a 24% gain.Results from scores of regional banks this past week eased any lingering fears that mid-sized financial institutions faced the sort of existential threat that surfaced in the spring when the failures of three sizable banks triggered outflows across the banking system.Deposits were up at most smaller banks, even those that suffered outflows during the first quarter, and investors responded by pushing stocks higher.KBW Nasdaq Regional Bank Index (^KRX), which tracks the performance of the smaller banks, rose 7.3% for the week, its best weekly performance in more than a year. The KBW Nasdaq Bank Index (^BKX), which includes some of the biggest banks, was also up 6.5%.Zions (ZION), a bank based in Salt Lake City, jumped 9% Thursday. Citizens (CFG), of Providence, Rhode Island, was up 6% on the same day. US Bancorp (USB) of Minneapolis also rose 6.5% the day it reported.But the results also showed a number of these banks still face numerous challenges.Most attracted more deposits during the quarter by paying a lot more for them, cutting into a key measure of profitability. Twelve regional lenders revised down their estimates of revenue or lending profits for the rest of the year, including PNC (PNC) and Truist (TFC) as well as Western Alliance and Zions.Many of these same institutions are also bracing for higher capital requirements from the Federal Reserve that could be released as early as next week. Bankers argue that more stringent buffers will make it more challenging for them to earn robust profits in the future and possibly crimp lending.Story continues'Spotting one robin doesn't make it spring'The run-up in bank stocks this week, Odeon Capital analyst Dick Bove said in a note, happened because the values of banks had fallen so far relative to the rest of the market.""There has been no significant shift in the earnings outlook of the group,"" he wrote. In fact, many banks ""are suggesting that investors be cautious in estimating future earnings results.""One such institution is Cincinnati-based Fifth Third (FITB), the nation’s 17th-largest bank. Its deposits rose, but the bank trimmed its full-year forecast range for net interest income. That key figure measures the difference between what banks earn on their loans and what they pay for their deposits.""We're going to always plan around a more conservative outcome because if we're wrong, everybody does well, and if we're right, we're better positioned to deliver stable earnings,"" said CEO Tim Spence.The bank's CFO, James Leonard, told analysts that ""our June, like everyone else's, was quite strong,"" but ""spotting one robin doesn't make it spring. And therefore, we're going to continue to be cautious in the outlook and play defense in this environment.""A Fifth Third branch in Boca Raton, Fla. REUTERS/Joe Skipper (Joe Skipper / reuters)The outlook for regional bank stocks in the near term ""really isn’t that good"" based on the fundamentals, according to Matt Maley, Miller Tabak's chief market strategist.""Lending has gone down,"" Maley said. ""Where are they going to make money?""Chris McGratty, head of US bank research with Keefe, Bruyette &amp; Woods, noted that ""the stocks have done better because expectations were really really low,"" admitting that his team had ""taken a pretty good hatchet"" to future earnings estimates ahead of this past week.He also noted the technical contribution to the week's rally. Short sellers were forced to buy $469 million worth of bank stocks over the past seven days to cover their positions, according to data from market analytics firm S3.The boost contributed most to the stocks of US Bancorp, Zions, and Cleveland-based KeyCorp (KEY), according to the data.""There’s been a lot of short covering,"" McGratty said, adding that ""when things appear less bad, that can kick up the animal spirits.""Retail investors were part of the week's action, too. On Wednesday, during the rally's peak, regional bank stocks saw average daily inflows that were three times what was received in the past two weeks, according to data from market analytics firm Vanda.""It looks like retail traders took the good news around deposits in stride and decided to chase rather than sell some of these regional names,"" Marco Iachini, Vanda's senior vice president of research, told Yahoo Finance.Click here for the latest stock market news and in-depth analysis, including events that move stocksRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance]"

An insider's optimism about the company's prospects is a positive sign.While insider transactions are not the most important thing when it comes to long-term investing, we do think it is perfectly logical to keep tabs on what insiders are doing. Check out our latest analysis for U.S. Bancorp The Last 12 Months Of Insider Transactions At U.S. BancorpIn the last twelve months, the biggest single purchase by an insider was when Independent Director Scott Wine bought US$1m worth of shares at a price of US$32.85 per share. We do like to see buying, but this purchase was made at well below the current price of US$38.42. Because the shares were purchased at a lower price, this particular buy doesn't tell us much about how insiders feel about the current share price.In the last twelve months insiders purchased 76.70k shares for US$2.4m. But they sold 46.00k shares for US$2.0m. In total, U.S. Bancorp insiders bought more than they sold over the last year. The chart below shows insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last year. If you want to know exactly who sold, for how much, and when, simply click on the graph below!insider-trading-volumeU.S. Bancorp is not the only stock insiders are buying. So take a peek at this free list of growing companies with insider buying.Insiders At U.S. Bancorp Have Bought Stock RecentlyIt's good to see that U.S. Bancorp insiders have made notable investments in the company's shares. In total, insiders bought US$2.1m worth of shares in that time, and we didn't record any sales whatsoever. This is a positive in our book as it implies some confidence.Does U.S. Bancorp Boast High Insider Ownership?Another way to test the alignment between the leaders of a company and other shareholders is to look at how many shares they own. We usually like to see fairly high levels of insider ownership. U.S. Bancorp insiders own 0.2% of the company, currently worth about US$118m based on the recent share price. This kind of significant ownership by insiders does generally increase the chance that the company is run in the interest of all shareholders.Story continuesWhat Might The Insider Transactions At U.S. Bancorp Tell Us?It is good to see recent purchasing. And the longer term insider transactions also give us confidence. Once you factor in the high insider ownership, it certainly seems like insiders are positive about U.S. Bancorp. One for the watchlist, at least! So these insider transactions can help us build a thesis about the stock, but it's also worthwhile knowing the risks facing this company. While conducting our analysis, we found that U.S. Bancorp has 1 warning sign and it would be unwise to ignore this.If you would prefer to check out another company -- one with potentially superior financials -- then do not miss this free list of interesting companies, that have HIGH return on equity and low debt.For the purposes of this article, insiders are those individuals who report their transactions to the relevant regulatory body.

This call will be recorded and available for replay beginning today at approximately 11:00 a.m. Central Time. I will now turn the conference call over to George Anderson, Senior Vice President and Director of Investor Relations for U.S. Bancorp.George Anderson: Thank you, Brad, and good morning, everyone. With me today are Andy Cecere, our Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer; Terry Dolan, our Vice Chair and Chief Financial Officer; and John Stern, Senior Executive Vice President and Head of Finance. During initial prepared remarks, Andy and Terry will be referencing a slide presentation. A copy of the presentation, our earnings release, and supplemental analyst schedules are available on our website at usbank.com. Please note that any forward-looking statements made during today's call are subject to risk and uncertainties.

Following our prepared remarks, Andy, Terry, and John will take any questions that you have. I will now turn the call over to Andy.Andy Cecere: Thanks, George. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining our call. I'll begin on Slide 3. The second quarter was highlighted by our successful conversion of Union Bank and a meaningful increase in our common equity tier one ratio to 9.1%, 60 basis points higher than the first quarter, driven by earnings accretion and balance sheet optimization actions. Earnings per share totaled $0.84 in the second quarter, including $0.28 per share of notable items. Excluding the impact of notable items, earnings per share was $1.12. Slide 4 provides reported and adjusted income statement results and other key metrics. Our second quarter results were supported by new customer account growth and deepening of relationships across our business lines, as well as continued disciplined expense management.Story continuesNet interest income was lower compared with the first quarter, primarily due to pressures on deposit pricing. However, momentum and fee income businesses continue strong. One of the strengths of our business model is our diverse and stable funding that includes a mix of both consumer and operational wholesale deposits. This quarter, while our average deposit balances decreased by 2.6% linked-quarter, period end deposits were higher by 3.2% or approximately $522 billion, largely reflective of seasonal operational deposit flows in areas such as our corporate banking and trust businesses. Credit quality metrics remained strong versus pre-pandemic levels, but are normalizing as expected. This quarter, we strengthened our balance sheet by increasing the loan loss reserve, reflective of our prudent approach to credit risk management.Slide 5 provides key performance metrics. Excluding notable items, our return on average assets was about 1.07%, and our return on tangible common equity was 22.3%. Slide 6 provides a summary of our recently completed conversion of Union Bank. Following our main systems conversion on Memorial Day weekend, all credit cards, trust and investment accounts, were transitioned to our platform in June. Early indications are encouraging, and I'm even more confident today of the strategic and financial merits of this deal. We continue to expect meaningful revenue opportunities, and our cost synergy targets remain intact. One highlight is the Union Bank customers are adopting our digital capabilities more quickly than expected. As of June 30, just one month following conversion, we've had over a half a million enrollments in our digital product offerings, and this number continues to grow.Our teams are working diligently to leverage the value of overlaying all of our products and services to Union Bank customers as we continue to provide - and we'll continue to provide updates on our progress. I’ll now turn the call over to Terry, who’ll provide more detail on the quarter.Card, Client, BankPhoto by Dylan Gillis on UnsplashTerry Dolan: Thanks, Andy. Turning to Slide 7, our balanced mix of consumer, corporate and commercial deposits continues to be a key source of strength for the bank. As Andy highlighted, while average total deposits declined 2.6% or $13.1 billion on a linked-quarter basis, we ended the period with $522 billion of deposits, representing a 3.2% increase in ending balances on a linked-quarter. This quarter, our end of period percent of non-interest bearing deposits declined to approximately 20% from 25% in the first quarter, due to both industry dynamics and a change we made to Union Bank retail accounts at conversion. Specifically, about half of the decline was related to an increase in deposit volumes and mix shift, while the other half was primarily driven by a customer-friendly product conversion decision by us.To create a more positive customer experience, we upgraded Union Bank customers to our interest-bearing Bank Smartly checking product, which offers a better checking solution, as well as other benefits. This change will provide customer retention benefits without a material impact on our net interest margin. Given current interest rate volatility and the significant competition for deposits across the industry, we now expect our cumulative deposit beta to be in the mid 40% range by the end of this rate cycle, slightly higher than our previous expectation, but consistent with the deposit pricing dynamics in the industry. On Slide 8, average total loans this quarter were $389 billion, which was flat on a linked-quarter basis, and up 19.9% year-over-year.Commercial real estate loans represent approximately 14% of our total average loan portfolio, with commercial real estate office exposure representing only 2% of total loans, and 1% of total commitments. Our office exposure is well balanced amongst suburban, specialty, and central business districts, and had a weighted average loan-to-value ratio of approximately 55% at initial underwriting. Given current macro factors, as well as other portfolio considerations, we increased the reserve ratio for commercial real estate office loans to 8.5%. Turning to Slide 9, we reported diluted earnings per share of $0.84 for the quarter, or $1.12 per share after adjusting for notable items in the amount of $575 million or $0.28 per diluted common share. Notable items this quarter included $310 million of merger and integration-related charges associated with the acquisition of Union Bank, as well as $265 million related to balance sheet optimization and capital management actions, largely driven by a provision charge of $243 million related to the securitization of approximately $4.4 billion of indirect auto loans, as well as an additional $4.2 billion sale of Union Bank mortgage loans.These moves enable us to more effectively position the balance sheet for profitable growth and optimize returns. Slide 10 provides a more detailed earnings summary for the quarter. Turning to Slide 11, net interest income on a fully taxable equivalent basis totaled approximately $4.4 billion, which represented a 4.7% decrease on a linked-quarter basis, and a 28.4% increase from a year ago due to the impact of rising rates in the acquisition of Union Bank. Our net interest margin declined from 3.10% in the first quarter to 2.9% in the second quarter, which is somewhat lower than expected. The linked-quarter decline was primarily due to the impact of maintaining higher cash levels given the debt ceiling concerns and deposit pricing pressures, partially offset by higher rates on earning assets.Slide 12 highlights trends in non-interest income. Non-interest income increased 8.7% or $219 million on a linked-quarter basis, driven by higher payment services revenue, trust and investment management fees, and commercial product revenues. Within payment services, revenue increased $112 million on a linked-quarter basis, reflecting credit card revenue growth of $62 million or 17.2%, driven by higher margins and sales volume, and an increase in merchant processing revenue of $49 million or 12.7%, driven by pricing. Also noteworthy were increases in trust and investment management fees of $31 million or 5.3%, driven by core business growth and commercial product revenue of $24 million or 7.2%, driven by strong debt capital markets activity in the quarter.Compared with a year ago, non-interest income for the company increased $178 million or 7.0%, largely driven by higher core fee income. Turning to Slide 13, reported non-interest expense for the company totaled $4.6 billion in the second quarter, which included $310 million of merger and integration-related charges. Non-Interest expense, as adjusted, decreased $52 million, or 1.2% on a linked-quarter basis. Slide 14 shows credit quality trends, which continue to be strong from a historical perspective, but are normalizing as expected. The ratio of non-performing assets to loans and other real estate was 0.29% at June 30, compared to 0.3% at March 31, and 0.23% a year ago. Our second quarter net charge-off ratio of 0.35%, as adjusted, increased five basis points from a first quarter level of 0.3%, as adjusted, and was higher when compared to the second quarter 2022 level 0.2%.Our allowance for credit losses as of June 30, totaled $7.7 billion or 2.03% of period end loans. Turning to Slide 15, we accelerated our capital actions and ended the quarter with a CET1 capital ratio of 9.1%. The 60 basis points linked-quarter increase in the CET1 ratio, reflected 20 basis points of earnings accretion net of distributions, and an additional 40 basis points attributable to risk-weighted asset and other balance sheet optimization initiatives, with low to neutral earnings impact. During the quarter, we received the results of the Federal Reserve’s 2023 stress test, and we expect to be subject to the minimum stress capital buffer requirement of 2.5%, which is unchanged from last year. Despite this year's more stressful economic scenario and an additional $1.4 billion of merger-related charges, with limited recognition of cost synergies related to Union Bank.I will provide third quarter and updated full year 2023 forward-looking guidance on Slide 16. Starting with third quarter 2023 guidance, we expect net interest income of between $4.2 billion and $4.4 billion in the third quarter. Total revenue as adjusted is estimated to be in the range of $6.9 billion to $7.1 billion, including approximately $75 million of purchase accounting accretion. Total non-interest expense as adjusted is expected to be approximately $4.3 billion, inclusive of approximately $120 million of core deposit intangible amortization related to the Union Bank acquisition. Our income tax rate as adjusted is expected to be approximately 23% to 24% on a taxable equivalent basis. We expect merger and integration charges of between $150 million to $200 million in the third quarter.I will now provide updated guidance for the full year. For 2023, net interest income is expected to be in the range of $17.5 billion to $18.0 billion. Total revenue as adjusted is now expected to be in the range of $28.0 billion to $29.0 billion, inclusive of approximately $330 million of full year purchase accounting accretion. Total non-interest expense as adjusted for the year is expected to be approximately $17 billion, inclusive of approximately $500 million of core deposit intangible amortization related to Union Bank. Our estimated full year income tax rate on a taxable equivalent basis, as adjusted, is expected to be approximately 23% to 24%. We continue to expect to have $900 million to $1 billion of merger and integration charges in 2023, and total merger and integration cost of approximately $1.4 billion, consistent with earlier guidance.I will now hand it back to Andy for closing remarks.Andy Cecere: Thanks, Terry. I'll finish up on Slide 17. The strength and stability of our balance sheet remains a differentiator for our company. As these metrics indicate, we are well capitalized and prepared for a potentially more challenging economic environment, given our strong liquidity, diversified business mix, and consistent and disciplined approach to credit risk management. Building capital remains a top priority as we prepare for Category II designation, and we are confident in our ability to execute on our strategic growth opportunities and key initiatives. Following the successful conversion of Union Bank this quarter, we entered the second half of the year well-positioned as a national banking franchise, with increased scale, broader reach, and meaningful revenue growth opportunities provided by the addition of 1.2 million new consumer and small business customers.Across the business, from consumer to wealth management and commercial to business banking, we see significant opportunities to provide legacy Union Bank customers with a broad set of our products and services and industry-leading digital capabilities. Additionally, the $900 million of identified cost synergies are still expected to be fully reflected in run rate savings as we head into 2024. Let me close by thanking our employees for all that they do to help provide exceptional service that makes us a destination of choice for our clients and a valued partner to all our stakeholders.

Yahoo Finance Live's Myles Udland and Seana Smith review the environment for financial stocks and how it may not be all ""doom and gloom"" for regional banks based on earnings performances.Video TranscriptSEANA SMITH: And there were certainly a lot of, I guess, worry going into this week at exactly what the banks were going to tell us. And when you compare maybe the results from JP Morgan to the results of Goldman Sachs, obviously, a very different picture, not exactly surprising, something that we did expect going into this earnings season.But when you take into account some of the other banks that we also heard from because regionals and almost seemed like investor sentiment there was it's OK. It's better than expected. Deposit levels look like they have stabilized just a bit. And the market at least right now looking at that as a win.MYLES UDLAND: Yeah. And I know we can take a look at a couple of different regionals. Western Alliance was one of those names that all of a sudden everybody knew that stock. I think we have Western, Zions Bancorp, and KeyBank on this chart. And you look all these names over the last month, up at least 15%. Western Alliance up quite a bit more than that. All of these names higher on the week by more than, I think it's more than 10%. Can't quite make that out there.But we have seen these names move higher on their earnings. And it is funny looking at both the reaction in these stocks and the way that these management teams talked on the call to think that it was only, what, 3 and 1/2 months ago that we were, like, maybe there's another banking crisis. Who could really-- how many more banks will fail.And Western Alliance was certainly one of those names that there was a lot of concern about in the market, the viability of the bank at all. And now you kind of get on the other side of that. I mean, you remember folks coming on the show almost every day saying, there might be a big opportunity here. And, well, here's the opportunity, I guess. You had to really have to hold your nose. But, you know, this is now turning into the kind of story that I think when you x out the unique issues that SVB and others, you can talk yourself into.Story continuesSEANA SMITH: Yeah. No glaring credit issues. It seems like at least that is obviously good news here or enough, I should say, obviously. It's good news. But enough here for investors at least at this point. But they're not out of the woods yet when it comes to the fact that they are being forced to pay more in order to keep those deposits there at a massive disadvantage when you compare many of those regional banks to the current position of those larger banks. And the fact that environment might not change anytime.MYLES UDLAND: Looking at that year to date chart on those names, I think it is fair to say that the old-- because the old story with regional banks is basically, well, if rates go up, it's good because these are more deposit-heavy banks, therefore, they can make more money on the spread, the net interest income, right? And with there not being competition for deposits, the idea is that, well, you can just turn the higher, you know, rate that you can get on a Treasury or whatever and move that right to your bottom line.So I think to some extent, investors may be sleepwalked into this year with this story specifically. And yes, now there is quite a bit of work to do to rightsize that, let's say. But ultimately, you are probably not going to see-- it seems at this point. Look, famous last words, don't clip this. Probably not going to see like 10 more banks fail before the end of this year.SEANA SMITH: I hope you're right.MYLES UDLAND: It feels like that, right?SEANA SMITH: That seems like a pretty safe.MYLES UDLAND: It feels like there will probably be fewer than 10 banks in the US fail for the balance of 2023. That's my big prediction.SEANA SMITH: I'm going to side with you on that one. I think it's fair.]"

The Sam’s Club Plus membership debuted in 1999, while Walmart+ was launched much more recently, in September 2020.However, you’ll pay a little bit more for the higher-tier membership from Sam’s these days. On Oct. 17, 2022, Sam’s Club increased the fee for its Plus membership from $100 to $110, which was the first time the price had been raised since the membership’s debut over two decades ago.The membership fee for Walmart+ has remained the same since its launch: $12.95 per month or $98 per year. However, the retailer did increase its free trial period from 15 days to 30 days at some point.Besides the difference in cost, find out which ‘Plus’ membership gives you the most bang for your buck — Sam’s Club or Walmart?Benefits of Sam’s Club Plus MembershipA Sam’s Club Plus Membership has all of the benefits of a Sam’s Club Membership and these additional benefits:Two membership cards: One for the primary account holder and one for another member of your household, referred to as a complimentary cardholder.16 club-level members added to your account at a reduced rate of $45 each.Free shipping on most online items for primary and complimentary cardholders.Free curbside pickup.Additional optical and pharmacy discounts, including 20% off a complete pair of prescription eyeglasses or sunglasses.Plus Rewards: 2% back on qualifying purchases.Early shopping hours.Benefits of Walmart+ MembershipUnlike Sam’s, Walmart offers just one level of membership, the Walmart+ Membership. Here are its benefits:30-day free trial.Free shipping with no order minimum.Free Paramount+ subscription.Return items from home with no printing labels or repacking of items; Walmart comes to your home and picks items up.Fuel savings at over 14,000 locations, including Exxon, Mobil, Sam’s Club, Walmart and Murphy stations.Earn Walmart rewards that never expire.Exclusive early access to Walmart promotions events, including Black Friday.Free same-day grocery delivery.Mobile Scan &amp; Go access to streamline in-store shopping.Various limited-time offers, such as, “Buy 6 months of Babbel, Get 6 months Free.”Story continuesThe Case for Sam’s Club Plus MembershipSamantha Hawrylack, personal finance expert and co-founder of How To FIRE, said she is both a Sam’s Plus Member and a Walmart+ member. However, she has a clear favorite.Benefits Can Really Add Up“I can say that for me, Sam’s has been the better deal,” she said. “In my opinion, it’s far better to have a Sam’s Club Plus membership. My Sam ‘s Club Plus membership paid for itself within three months between pharmacy, grocery pickups, one-time event tickets and shipping.Prices and Discounts Are Worth It“With the Plus option, Sam’s Club also gives you a discount directly off your upcoming purchase (no reimbursement checks),” she said, “and most items online are available with free shipping and no markups in comparison to Costco or Walmart, and [Sam’s Club] prices frequently outperform other retailers by a wide percentage.”It’s Usually Less ExpensiveMore from Hawrylack: “But of course, in terms of business model, Sam’s Club was specifically built with a base model that has always aimed to offer value on comparable items and sell them for 5% less than Walmart. When calculating cost per unit or cost per ounce, Sam’s Club is usually less expensive; it’s literally more worth it for bulk purchases and businesses/organizations.”Sam’s Club Has Cash Back“Sam’s Club Plus offers an across-the-board 2% cash back on all qualified purchases,” said David Bakke, personal finance expert at DollarSanity. “While Walmart+ offers plenty of discounts and other perks, it does not feature cash back.”Where Walmart+ Stands OutBakke gave a couple of examples that might make Walmart+ the better membership to have.Walmart+ Is a Better Buy“Walmart+ is a better buy but narrowly,” Bakke said. “It costs $98 annually while Sam’s Club Plus costs $110 each year. This is worth noting for comparison shopping purposes.”Walmart+ Is Reciprocal To Sam’s But Not The Other Way Around“Walmart essentially owns Sam’s Club; therefore, with a Walmart+ membership, you’ll enjoy certain perks, benefits and discounts at Sam’s Club,” Bakke pointed out. “But with a Sam’s Club Plus membership, you won’t get anything at Walmart.”Sam’s Club vs. Walmart: Which ‘Plus’ Membership Is Right for You?“If you are roped into paying a $100 yearly membership fee to [Sam’s Club] Plus and don’t take advantage of many of the benefits that make it worthwhile — or worse, if you start spending more than you should because you believe it will save you more money in the long run — skipping the membership and going with Walmart may be a better option,” advised Hawrylack. “As to which retailer will save you more money, it actually depends on you, your family and your purchase habits.”More From GOBankingRates5 Cities Becoming Popular With Baby Boomers: Are They Right for Your Retirement Years?Unplug These Appliances That Hike Up Your Electricity Bill3 Things You Must Do When Your Savings Reach $50,000The 4 Types of Bank Accounts All Small Businesses Should HaveThis article originally appeared on GOBankingRates.com: Sam’s Club or Walmart: Which ‘Plus’ Membership Gives You the Most Bang for Your Buck?]"

The company’s quarterly results are likely to reflect growth in revenues and funds from operations (FFO) per share.In the last reported quarter, this Chicago, IL-based residential real estate investment trust’s (REIT) normalized FFO per share of 87 cents narrowly missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 88 cents. Higher expenses due to repair and maintenance work resulting from severe California rain storms, coupled with increased property-related legal and administrative expenditures, acted as a dampener.Over the trailing four quarters, Equity Residential surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate on two occasions, met on one and missed the same on the other, the average surprise being 1.17%. The graph below depicts this surprise history:Equity Residential Price and EPS SurpriseEquity Residential Price and EPS SurpriseEquity Residential price-eps-surprise | Equity Residential QuoteAs we approach the release of Equity Residential's second-quarter 2023 earnings report, it is important to examine how this residential REIT is likely to have performed amid the current market conditions.US Residential Real Estate Market in Q2Despite cooling rent growth, apartment demand is showing signs of a solid rebound, with net absorption in the second quarter of 2023 nearing surging new supply levels. This stabilizes occupancy rates after a steep decline in 2022.Per RealPage data, in the second quarter, net demand registered at 83,449 units, and this marked a five-quarter high. While this is still below the record numbers seen during the 2021 boom, it indicates a normalization of apartment demand. This demand rebound coincides with a 50-year high in apartment construction starting to convert into peak completions, with more than 107,000 units completed in the second quarter of this year itself.However, despite the supply surge, this solid demand is aiding in the mitigation of vacancy spikes in most markets, with U.S. apartment occupancy coming at 94.7% as of June, marking only a 0.1 percentage point decline since January. It marks a notable improvement compared to the occupancy fall of 1.2 percentage points in the first half of 2022 and then an additional 1.4 percentage points in the second half of the year.However, rent growth remains below normal in 2023, with year-over-year effective asking rent growth at just 1.5%. This is due to apartment operators prioritizing occupancy rates over rents, leading to more options for renters and putting downward pressure on rent growth. Same-store effective asking rents increased only 0.46% between May and June 2023.  Amid this rebound in demand, Equity Residential’s quarterly performance is likely to have been supported by its portfolio diversification efforts in the urban and suburban markets. It has a healthy balance sheet and banks on technology, scale and organizational capabilities to drive growth. EQR’s target resident is more affluent, with lower unemployment and favorable prospects ahead.In the second quarter, Equity Residential bolstered its 2023 earnings guidance, citing continued strong demand in its markets, particularly New York, and lower-than-expected delinquency rates, mainly in Southern California. The revision reflected optimism from the company’s leadership. President and CEO Mark J. Parrell noted limited new apartment supply in most of EQR's markets as well as high prices and the low availability of single-family homes as favorable factors for their outlook.Per its May Investor Update presentation, leasing spreads, both for new leases and renewals, have been increasing up until May, setting the stage for a healthy summer leasing season. The blended rate has been showing improvement, with New York showing particularly strong momentum.Furthermore, Bad Debt, Net, has meaningfully improved beyond expectations due to an improvement in delinquency and an increase in move-outs from residents with high delinquent balances.We expect second-quarter same-store revenue growth of 5.9% year over year, while expenses are expected to increase by 2.9%. Consequently, same-store net operating income (NOI) is estimated to expand 7.2%. Physical occupancy is expected at 96.2%, suggesting a 30-basis point increase sequentially.Currently, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company’s quarterly revenues stands at $714.8 million, indicating a 4.04% increase year over year.Before the second-quarter earnings release, the company’s activities were not adequate to gain analysts’ confidence. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarterly normalized FFO per share has remained unchanged in the past month at 94 cents. However, it suggests year-over-year growth of 5.6%.Story continuesHere Is What Our Quantitative Model PredictsOur proven model predicts a surprise in terms of FFO per share for Equity Residential this season. The combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) increases the chances of an FFO beat, which is the case here.Equity Residential currently carries a Zacks Rank of 2 and has an Earnings ESP of +0.85%.

Earnings documents, which include our forward-looking statements disclaimer and non-GAAP information are available on the Investor Relations section of our website. With that, let me now turn it over to Steve.Story continuesStephen D. SteinourThanks, Tim. Good morning, everyone, and welcome. Thank you for joining the call today. We're pleased to announce our second quarter results, which Zach will detail later. Our approach to both our colleagues and customers continues to be grounded in our purpose and served us well in the second quarter. Our colleagues again demonstrated that we make people's lives better, help businesses thrive and strengthen the communities we serve. Now, on to Slide 4. These are the key messages we want to highlight today. First, Huntington has a distinguished deposit franchise, which continues to benefit from our strategy to acquire and deepen primary bank customer relationships. This has fueled continued deposit growth over the year, including this quarter. Second, we once again drove capital ratios higher with common equity Tier 1 having increased for 4 quarters in a row. We remain on track to build CET1 to the high end of our range by year-end. Third, credit quality, which is a hallmark of the company is performing very well, and we continue to operate within our aggregate moderate to low risk appetite. Fourth, we are dynamically managing through the interest rate environment. We are maintaining disciplined deposit pricing while delivering deposit growth and maintaining a robust liquidity position. Finally, we remain intently focused on executing our strategy. We are investing in the business to drive long-term sustainable revenue growth, and we continue to proactively manage the expense base to align with the revenue outlook. Operation accelerate remains on track, and we will increase our use of business process outsourcing to drive sustained efficiencies into 2024. Moving on to Slide 5. Over the past decade, we've transformed Huntington. This puts us in a position of strength today. This foundation includes our granular and high-quality deposit base, which is supported by our leading consumer, business and commercial banking franchises. With this strong foundation in place, we can be nimble and seasonal opportunities to expand our business that will arise during times like these. The hiring of the fund finance team we announced last month is a great example. This business was on our Commercial Banking growth road map, and we're pleased to be able to add great talent and welcome these colleagues to Huntington. We are building capital even as we maintain loan growth. We are optimizing the level of new loan growth and remaining judicious for the loans we carry on balance sheet in order to generate the highest return on capital. As a result, capital ratios expanded in the second quarter with our CET1 ratio increasing to 9.82%. Further, our adjusted CET1 ratio is 8.12% above the peer median. Our disciplined approach to risk management drives our strong credit quality with low net charge-offs and the nonperforming asset ratio decreasing for the eighth consecutive quarter. Our management team has a long track record of being disciplined operators with a focus on delivering value for shareholders. This execution has been awarded and recognized across the franchise, including winning the J.D. Power Mobile Award for the fifth year in a row and maintaining our strong #1 SBA ranking.Regarding the macro outlook, it remains a dynamic environment, interest rates are playing out in the higher for longer scenario that we had been anticipating for some time. Economic activity in our footprint appears to be holding up relatively well, which supports sustained loan growth and solid credit performance. That said, we are diligent watching the environment closely and are actively managing our loan portfolio. We are well prepared to operate through a range of potential scenarios. Further, we are also closely monitoring the potential regulatory adjustments to capital and other requirements. We are evaluating the proposals and thus far, the potential new requirements appear broadly in line with what we had expected. We are well positioned to manage through these changes, address them expediently and over time, offset a meaningful portion of the potential impacts. And finally, before I hand it over to Zach, we want to share that Rich Pohle, our Chief Credit Officer, has announced his upcoming retirement effective at the end of 2023. We've greatly benefited from Rich's expertise and leadership during his nearly 12 years with Huntington. He's been a great leader of our colleagues and a great partner for me and the executive team. We have a strong bench and we're pleased Brendan Lawlor, Deputy Chief Credit Officer, will succeed Rich in this role at the end of the year. Brendan joined us in 2019 after 25-plus years as a Senior Commercial Credit Executive at a large regional bank and is currently responsible for all commercial credit across the bank. Zach, over to you to provide more detail on our financial performance.Zachary J. WassermanThanks, Steve, and good morning, everyone. Slide 6 provides highlights of our second quarter results. We reported GAAP earnings per common share of $0.35. Return on tangible common equity, or ROTCE, came in at 19.9% for the quarter. Further adjusting for AOCI, ROTCE was 15.8%. Deposits grew during the quarter, increasing by $2.7 billion or 1.9% on an end-of-period basis. Loan balances continue to grow as total loans increased by $900 million or 0.8% from the prior quarter. Credit quality remains strong with net charge-offs of 16 basis points and allowance for credit losses of 1.93%. As Steve mentioned, capital increased from the prior quarter. This solid capital position, coupled with our robust credit reserves, puts our CET1 plus ACL loss-absorbing capacity in the top quartile of the peer group. Turning to Slide 7. Average loan balances increased 0.8% quarter-over-quarter or 3.1% annualized, driven by commercial loans, which increased by $772 million or 1.1% from the prior quarter. Primary components of this commercial growth included distribution finance, which increased $464 million; asset Finance increased by $234 million; Business Banking increased by $160 million; Auto floorplan increased by $175 million. Offsetting this growth, CRE balances were lower by $340 million. In Consumer, growth continued to be led by residential mortgage, which increased by $438 million; and RV Marine, which increased by $112 million. Partially offsetting this growth were lower auto loan balances, which declined by $318 million. Turning to Slide 8. As noted, we continued to deliver ending deposit growth in the second quarter. Balances were higher by $2.7 billion, primarily driven by consumer with commercial balances up modestly. On a year-over-year basis, ending deposits increased by $2.6 billion or 1.8%. Turning to Slide 9. We saw sustained growth in deposit balances throughout the second quarter. On a monthly basis, total deposit average balances expanded sequentially for April, May and June, with June 30 ending balances above the June monthly average, providing a strong start point as we enter Q3. Within consumer deposits, we have now seen average balances increase for 7 months in a row. Within Commercial, average monthly deposits were stable over the course of the second quarter. Turning to Slide 10. I want to share more details on our noninterest-bearing deposits. Overall, the $33 billion of these deposits represent 23% of total balances and are well diversified across Consumer, Business and Commercial Banking. The ongoing mix shift we have seen from noninterest-bearing over the past 2 quarters has been in line with our expectations and consistent with what we saw in the last cycle. We expect this mix shift trend to moderate and then stabilize in 2024. This trend is reflected in our total deposit beta guidance. On to Slide 11. For the quarter, net interest income decreased by $61 million or 4.3% to $1,357 billion, driven by lower sequential net interest margin. On a year-over-year basis, NII increased $90 million or 7.1%. We continue to benefit significantly from our asset sensitivity and the expansion of margins that has occurred throughout the cycle. Reconciling the change in NIM from the prior quarter, we saw a reduction of 29 basis points on both a GAAP and core basis excluding accretion. During Q2, we maintained an elevated cash balance relative to Q1, which impacted NIM even as it had a relatively minor actual cash economic cost. On a comparative basis, normalizing for cash levels, NIM was 3.17% for the quarter or a 21 basis point decline from the prior quarter. The biggest drivers of the lower NIM quarter-over-quarter were higher funding costs partially offset by increased earning asset yields. We continue to analyze multiple potential interest rate scenarios as we forecast expected trends over the remainder of 2023 and into 2024. The 2 primary scenarios we incorporate include: one, which is represented by the forward yield curve and another, which assumes rates stay higher for longer and end 2024, approximately 75 basis points higher than the forward. We think this is the most likely range for short-term rates over the next 6 quarters. Based on this range, we anticipate net interest margin of approximately 3% by Q4, plus or minus a few basis points. This would equate to core net interest income on a dollar basis for the fourth quarter to be down approximately 1% to 2% from Q2 levels. As we look out further into 2024, clearly, the trends will depend on both those interest rate scenarios and what is happening with the broader economy and industry factors, including loan demand and deposit growth. That said, our modeling indicates NIM outlooks are stable to rising during 2024, which, coupled with earning asset growth, is expected to drive net interest income dollar expansion as we move through 2024. Turning to Slide 12. Cost of deposits moved higher in the quarter to 1.57%. Our cumulative beta through Q2 is 32%, up 7 percentage points from the prior quarter, in line with our expectations and prior guidance. As I mentioned, we continue to expect cumulative deposit beta of approximately 40%. Turning to Slide 13. On the securities portfolio, we saw another step-up in reported yields quarter-over-quarter. We did not reinvest cash flows from securities in the second quarter as we allowed those proceeds to remain in cash given the attractive short-term rates. Cash and securities balances on average increased by $5 billion from the prior quarter as we maintained higher cash levels in the quarter. As of June 30, on an ending basis, cash and securities totaled $52 billion, representing a more normalized level as we go forward into Q3. Turning to Slide 14. Our contingent liquidity continues to be robust. Our 2 primary sources of liquidity, cash and borrowing capacity at the FHLB and Federal Reserve represented $11 billion and $77 billion, respectively, at the end of Q2. At quarter end, this pool of available liquidity represented 205% of total uninsured deposits, a peer-leading coverage. Turning to Slide 15. Our hedging program is dynamic, continually optimized and well diversified. Our objectives are to protect capital in uprate scenarios and protect NIM in downrate scenarios. During the quarter, we further expanded our Pay Fix swaptions hedge position to protect capital from tail risk in substantive upgrade scenarios. There is a modest upfront premium associated with these swaptions and the hedges result in a mark-to-market each quarter as they're deemed economic hedges. On the subsequent slide, you will see that positive impact during the second quarter on our fee revenues. We also remain focused on our objective of managing NIM to protect the downside and have maintained additional upside NIM opportunity given our asset sensitivity. The interest rate movements in the first few weeks of Q3 have provided opportunities for additional attractive hedging. We have incrementally added modest additional exposures to both our capital protection and NIM protection hedge portfolios and will remain dynamic as we go throughout the quarter if further opportunities arise. Moving on to Slide 16. Noninterest income was $495 million for the second quarter. Excluding notable items, fees increased $40 million, including an $18 million benefit from the positive mark-to-market on the pay fix swaptions. Excluding this benefit, underlying fee income would have been $477 million. We saw solid performance in our key areas of strategic focus, including payments and wealth management. Capital markets revenues declined by $2 million from the prior quarter, however, increased by $3 million year-over-year. Clearly, the events of March and the U.S. debt ceiling debate caused a fairly challenging capital markets environment in Q2. However, pipelines remain solid, and there are encouraging signs pointing to opportunity in the back half of the year. Moving on to Slide 17. GAAP noninterest expense decreased by $36 million. Adjusted for notable items in the prior quarter, core expenses increased by $6 million, driven by a full quarter effect of annual merit increases and higher marketing spend. We entered the year with a posture of managing core expense growth to a very low level given the economic backdrop. We developed and executed a series of proactive actions to reduce expense run rates, including the voluntary retirement program, organizational alignment and our continued implementation of long-term efficiency programs such as branch optimization and operation accelerate. We continually calibrate the level of expense growth to revenues, and we're taking additional actions to further manage the pace of expense growth, even as we remain focused on self-funding investments in our key growth initiatives. We are actively working on the next set of medium-term efficiency opportunities, including business process outsourcing, which represents a promising lever for us to continue to deliver a low level expense growth into 2024. Slide 18 recaps our capital position. Common Equity Tier 1 increased to 9.82% and has increased sequentially for 4 quarters. OCI impacts to common equity Tier 1 resulted in an adjusted CET1 ratio of 8.12%. Our tangible common equity ratio, or TCE, increased 3 basis points to 5.80%. Q2 ending cash levels were higher than Q1 end, which impacted the TCE ratio by 2 basis points. Adjusting for AOCI, our TCE ratio was 7.45%. Our capital management strategy will result in expanding capital over the course of the year while maintaining our top priority to fund high-return loan growth. We intend to grow CET1 to the very high end of our target operating range of 9% to 10%. Adjusting for AOCI, we expect adjusted CET1 to be in the approximately mid-8s range by year-end. On Slide 19, credit quality continues to perform very well. As mentioned, net charge-offs were 16 basis points for the quarter. This was lower than last quarter by 3 basis points. On a year-over-year basis, charge-offs were up 13 basis points from the prior year's historic low level. Nonperforming assets declined from the previous quarter and have reduced for 8 consecutive quarters. Allowance for credit losses is higher by 3 basis points to 1.93% of total loans. On Slide 20, we continue to be below our target range of net charge-offs through the cycle of 25 to 45 basis points and our ACL coverage ratio is among the highest in our peer group. Let's turn to our 2023 outlook on Slide 21. As I noted, we analyzed multiple potential scenarios to project financial performance and develop management action plans. Our guidance is informed by the interest rate scenarios I discussed previously and the consensus economic outlook. On loans, our outlook is 5% to 6%, consistent with our prior expectations to be near the lower end of our prior range. On deposits, we maintain our outlook of 1% to 3% growth for the full year. Core net interest income ex PAA and PPP is expected to grow between 3% and 5%, inclusive of our expectations for deposit beta and loan growth. Noninterest income on a core full year basis is expected to be down 2% to 4%. This range reflects the results from capital markets we've already seen in Q2 and the assumption of gradual improvement in activities throughout the balance of the year. The remainder of our fee businesses are tracking very well to our prior expectations. On expenses, as noted, we are proactively managing with a posture to keep underlying core expense growth at a very low level and calibrated to revenue growth. For the full year, we expect core underlying expense growth between 1% and 2%, plus the incremental expenses from the full year run rate of Capstone and Torana of approximately $50 million and the 2 basis point increase in 2023 FDIC insurance rates of approximately $30 million. And finally, given the strong results posted during the first half of the year, we now expect full year net charge-offs to be between 20 to 30 basis points. With that, we will conclude our prepared remarks and move to Q&amp;A. Tim, over to you.Timothy R. SedabresThanks, Zack. Operator, we will now take questions. We ask that as a courtesy to your peers, each person ask only one question and one related follow-up. And then if that person has additional questions, he or she can add themselves back into the queue. Thank you.Question and Answer SessionOperator(Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from the line of Manan Gosalia with Morgan Stanley.Manan GosaliaI wanted to dig into your comments on NIM being stable to rising in 2024 under the 2 scenarios that you outlined for it. Can you expand on some of the moving parts in there, especially in the higher for longer scenario? I guess, would that put more pressure on NII than the forward curve scenario with higher deposit betas? Or do I have that wrong?Zachary J. WassermanManan, this is Zach. I'll take that one, and thanks for the question. I think the outlook that we're seeing is really consistent with both of those scenarios. So I think (inaudible) in the higher per longer scenario that's sort of the top end of that general range, would benefit from asset sensitivity, asset yields would continue to rise, likely there would be a continuation in kind of an extending (inaudible) of the liability pricing cycle. But the none of those 2 things, we continue to expect to actually be higher overall NIM, given the asset sensitivity and very consistent with what we've discussed over time. At the lower end of the scenario, you see the kind of the faster (inaudible) of the deposit pricing cycle, but also some less increase in asset pricing, and we likewise (inaudible). For the NIM, but albeit maybe a few basis points lower than that. So generally, higher rates for us continue to corroborate to hire them. I would note as well that during the course of 2024, we will benefit from the shifting from a negative carry on our downrate hedging program to much more neutral position by the end of the year. So that will be a support for NIM trajectory throughout the course of '24.Manan GosaliaGot it. And then separately, just on regulation overall, I know you noted that the new requirements seem to broadly coming in, in line with expectations. But maybe if you can dig into how you're managing ahead of that. I know you're keeping you're building capital levels from here. You're holding a high level of cash instead of reinvesting in securities. So maybe can you expand on where you expect regulation to go, especially as it relates to the AOCI opt-out as well as LCR.Zachary J. WassermanSure. As you know, we are trying to be planful anticipatory of where we think things are going and manage it headed. And I think at the most macro level, we do think we'll be able to relatively expediently address these potential new regulations. And frankly, over time, offset a lot of what otherwise the potential impact on them. But digging in specifically, it's our working assumption that the tailoring exclusion of AOCI, not (inaudible) CET1 will likely be removed. And hence, it's our plan to see to manage capital hire to CET1 inclusive of AOCI higher in the guidance we indicated in the mid-8s range by the end of 2023. And if we continue on with the same operating posture to 2024, we would expect that ratio to approach 9% essentially get to 9% by the end of 2024. So back to essentially the low end of our operating range on that basis.We're also actively looking at the Basel III potential new RWA changes. As you know well, there are 3 big changes in there. The fundamental review of the trading book, we think that's going to essentially material for Huntington given our business mix. There's operational risk requirements, which likely will be increasing RWA, they're largely key-off of fee income. We see a slightly higher aridity from that. However, offsetting that, will be credit risk RWAs, which are more new ones, more fine-tuned and on-net are lower, we believe, for Huntington. Still early days, and we have more analysis to go away. We see offsetting factors there unclear whether there will be a net impact from that, but generally relatively offsetting. As it relates to other regulatory focuses like liquidity like potential long-term debt. Likewise, we're monitoring, and we think we can -- those impacts will be relatively small over time. Happy to double click on that and any further questions for folks want.OperatorOur next question comes from the line of Matt O'Connor with Deutsche Bank.Matthew Derek O'ConnorWe're seeing from some of your peers is a pullback in lending as they look to build capital and alleviate some funding pressure. On the flip side, obviously, you've got very strong capital, strong liquidity as you highlighted, high reserves. I'm just wondering how you're thinking about how you can play offset and maybe to even pull back by some of your peers?Zachary J. WassermanIt's a great question, Matt, and it's something that we really have to look at because we are in a position of strength. We want to really seize the opportunities to win new clients in a great business. It's in times like this that companies when they operate (inaudible) can being meaningfully during market share, and we're cognizant of that. We're balancing that clearly with 2 factors: One, the desire to not only grow loans, but to also drive capital or as I just noted in the prior question. So we're actively modulating loan growth, bringing it down from a 10% run rate year-over-year level to 5% in Q1, 3% in Q2. I think will be more like 1% probably the back half of the year. We're also very much looking at how we can potentially optimize the balance sheet and drive higher returns out of the assets that we do have. With that being said, we are on our front foot. You saw us hire the fund for the EMS team, which will be a great new business line for us, brings liquidity, great customer quality there. And we are continuing to look finding pockets of strong growth, even as we optimize for the highest returns for the year at the margin. So very much on the front book. And to your point, there are back opportunities that we'll see some (inaudible).Matthew Derek O'ConnorAnd then I guess just following up on the lending side. I mean everything we can track, it seems like auto spreads are at or near highs, (inaudible) highs, commercial spread of widen. So why isn't there a leaning into this? Or is it just that the demand is not there at this point?Zachary J. WassermanLook, I think there are continues to be pockets of demand and great clients. And we've got a very strong set of workforce supporting as well. And to your point, the yields are strong. With that being said, clearly, the deposit costs are also rising and funding costs are also rising. So we're balancing those things in the way we think is prudent. Driving higher yields, I would say, really feel encouraged by what we're seeing on the asset yield side. The long-durated asset categories like mortgage and auto really benefiting between 10 bps and 20 bps on the portfolio. And I expect that to continue for some time to come really sustaining that 2024 beyond NIM that we were talking about in the previous question, even as again, we optimize to also allow capital to us.Stephen D. SteinourMatt, this is Steve. I think it's fair to say we're being a little cautious until we know the outcome of the regulatory suggested reforms as well. There's more opportunity. I think that we will avail ourselves once we know what the rules are and the positions that we need to have going forward.OperatorOur next question comes from the line of Steven Alexopoulos with JPMorgan.Steven A. AlexopoulosI want to -- so at the commentary you gave about the NIM getting down to about 3% by the fourth quarter is helpful. I'd imagine once we move beyond that, because it sounds like most of the mix shift out of noninterest-bearing will be done, it's really going to be that incremental NIM that's going to decide where we go from there. What is the spot NIM today, right, incremental loans, incremental deposits? Just how does that compare to that 3% level?Zachary J. WassermanIt's still higher than that. I think, again, I'd point you to for the quarter adjusted for cash levels that we're kind of running at now in the third quarter, the second quarter was around 3.17%. And so what we're seeing at the margin is continued modest decline in them here through the course of the balance of this year from that 3.17% normalized Q2 run rate down to the 3% by the end of the year. And I agree with your point, which is as you get into the early part of next year, a lot of the kind of major trends starting to stabilize, and it's really not incremental fundamental what the underlying is. Likely, there will be some potential continued trends in the very early part of '24, but I agree with your point. I would also note that for us during the quarter, the reduction in the negative carrier from hedges will incrementally help obviously do the course of the year again.Steven A. AlexopoulosRight for some tailwinds there. Okay. And then for Steve. So the equity market seems to be coming around to this possibility of the soft landing. I'm curious, when you talk to your customers, what are you hearing? Are they coming around to the soft landing and maybe a little more optimistic what are you hearing.Stephen D. SteinourSteve, I would say our customers generally are having a good year and expect to close out with the good year. They're working their margins through expenses, but inflation seems to be a big, and the supply chain is in better shape. Clearer line sites to this half, and they're optimistic about '24 and beyond generally. So this would suggest at worst-case soft landing and potentially the ability to avoid a recession. In the Midwest, particularly our footprint, we still have a lot of economic activity, announcements of investments, targeted growth. So we're in a good position relative to some of the other regions, and we have significant activity going on that I think we'll see particularly here in Ohio through the course of this year.OperatorOur next question comes from the line of Ebrahim Poonawala with Bank of America.Ebrahim Huseini PoonawalaJust wanted to go -- spend some time on the expense outlook. I think you've done a lot of work year-to-date, the project actual rate that you talk about. In fact, I think you said the goal is to keep expense growth low for next year. Maybe give us a sense of the size of the BPO opportunity that you talked about? And how do you think about positive operating leverage going into next year given NII growth will likely be down. What's around that?Zachary J. WassermanYes. Great question, Ebrahim. Thanks. So maybe framing the overall (inaudible) is very much to keep operating expenses at a very low level, not only this year, but next year. We've been trying to be very proactive and setting up those programs and can implement them effectively and have to build over time. On the BPO opportunity, this is something that we have leveraged over time for a while and continually looking at from a strategic perspective, what functions that we really believe must be owned or the critical value for the real by Huntington versus those that we can benefit from the scale capabilities of partnering (inaudible). The more we need in to analyze that, the more we're encouraged there are incremental opportunities. Relatively modest in terms of size this year, but building over time. And I think really part of the portfolio of efficiency programs that will support that low level of '24 and frankly, to continue to build into '25 and beyond also. So it's encouraging to get part of the portfolio of programs with something that we're incrementally leading in now to be able to accelerate the benefits of. On positive operating leverage, as we've said a lot, it's a core tenet of our operating plans, one of the 3 major financial targets we set for ourselves, it's something we take very seriously. Of course, we're managing the company for the medium term to really generate value and want to make sure that we're not doing anything in the short term that we've damaged that long-term growth trajectory. Too early to say what '24 will look like. I think you'll clearly have a grow over on revenue that will pressure revenue growth, but we're also very encouraged with the opportunity to keep expense growth low. So not going to give guidance at this moment. I still think it's within the major reason that we're going to drive order.Stephen D. SteinourEbrahim, if I could add, this is Steve. The team is also working on a longer-term project operation accelerate. We shared that at the Investor Day. It's changing procedures and digitizing substantially the front to back side of the bank, that is going very well. It's on track. It was multiyear, and that will help us with both efficiencies and customer set. So we've Zach has got us focused on consolidated 3 branches. We did a voluntary retirement program. We've done some restructuring and segments and some of the business units and support units during the course of the year. What he's referencing now with BPL is additive to a very healthy level of focus and activity on the expense management side so far this year.Ebrahim Huseini PoonawalaUnderstood. And any updated thoughts? Steve, you talked about building capital, but at the same time, you've talked about fee revenue opportunities, doing some targeted M&amp;A like you've done in the past. Any thoughts there? Is the opportunity set attractive for you to do anything?Stephen D. SteinourWell, our focus, as you know, is always to grow the core of the business. We've got a lot of opportunity to do that in front of us. And as the regulatory expectations around capital and liquidity, et cetera, get established, I think we're going to be in a very strong position to (inaudible) that in an even more robust fashion. We're trying to get positioned for that now. the outlet, as you saw last year, there are a few businesses that were attractive. I suspect we'll find some additional ones at some point in the future. But we believe we've got a lot of opportunity at hand. There's nothing pressing in terms of pushing or needing to push for M&amp;A now. And so we're very, very focused on driving the core.OperatorOur next question comes from the line of Scott Siefers with Piper Sandler.Robert Scott SiefersSteve or Zach, kind of conceptually, maybe when you think about the 40% cumm beta, maybe just a thought or 2 on the major puts and takes when you think about that being the right number for you all. You guys are in a very competitive market, but I think it's clear within like the last month or so, especially that the deposit flows are there. So I guess I'm just curious what you're seeing in terms of competitive dynamics? What sort of makes that the right number to land on it?Zachary J. WassermanThis is Zach, I'll take that one. We -- all of the trends and forecasts that we're creating, and as I noted in the prepared remarks, pretty rigorous multiple scenarios underlying that continue to corroborate that. So we feel like it's a good forecast. As always -- I always know the best forecast we've got, we'll share an update on if ever that pass. But our focus has been pretty stable around that level for a while now and the kind of underlying monthly trends continue to cooperate. But just double-clicking into the drivers, I would say, one, we're seeing continued modest rise in deposit costs, but at a decelerating rate just like you would expect it to be -- we saw a beta trend by 8% in Q1, 7% in Q2. It will be less than that we go to Q3, clearly, and then kind of topping out into Q4. So that's why we're just sort of seeing a declining trend all be increasing. The other thing is the mix shift from noninterest-bearing into interest-bearing is occurring fairly well like we would expect it to in the cycle, and that lifeline is decelerating. And most of that mix shift has happened at this point. And we're already going to see the signs of that again kind of build up and corroborate to that 40%. On the competition side, it's a competitive environment. But to your point, the deposits are there. And I think it's what's encouraging is it's very rational. And I think that given decelerating loan growth throughout the industry and for us, that's the kind of escape valve and pressure, which is allowing us to manage pretty well here according to our plan. So overall, still in the right forecast.OperatorOur next question comes from the line of Erika Najarian with UBS.Erika NajarianMy first question is actually a clarification one, your 40% to the data, the unfold deposits, correct?Zachary J. WassermanThat's correct.Erika NajarianYes. Because a lot of your peers gave it on interest-bearing. So I just wanted to make sure that just touted that one, Scott was asking that question. And my real question is, I think the market really close sort of the expansion of the net interest income outlook. Could you tell us about how you're thinking about the elasticity of deposit license on the way down? I think to your point earlier, Zach, there are a lot of investors that are thinking about where you cut for next year. And they're wondering how much power do banks have price down if rates stay at a relatively high level versus what we've seen in a while?Zachary J. WassermanYes. Terrific questions. Also in soft topics, it's got lots of mind share just as vigorously as we anticipated on the way up on the just as our growth on the way down. So very much planning watching. I think it will clearly be a function of what segments you're in, what segment you're looking at. On the commercial side, where betas are generally higher and stone bespoke and prior agreement between us and our clients on how we'll trend that will likewise trend low. I think we're pretty confident will drive that as a very similar measure to the way it went up. I think -- many of the other very rational price segments like that in the middle market and business banking will likewise trend down pretty fast as rates decline. Again, in some of the categories in which we've been growing in consumer, there are some time dimensions to them, which we'll have to manage at those times to lapse. But again, the playbook there is well trod, and I think you feel quite good about the ability to bring that down. The overall last on the consumer side will clearly be a function of what's going on in the economy at that point and the outlook for a forward at that point, but of the playbooks in history would tend to grow our ability to do that pretty well.Erika NajarianGot it. And just as a follow-up to that, if I may. You're holding a lot of cash. And obviously, there's not a lot of motivation to deploy that. Again, as we think about next year in the same scenario, you're still going to be earning a lot of your cash on your cash flow 0% risk weight if the Fed moderately. And I guess outside of better loan growth, Zach, what would be the factors for you to normalize, start normalizing that cash to a level that's more appropriate? Or do you feel like with all the liquidity rolls down the pipe, you might as well just hold it there for now since you're getting paid for it anyway?Zachary J. WassermanYes. I think that the level that we're running at for cash right now is sort of around $8 billion to $9 billion is the right level for the company given the liquidity requirements. So I think we're generally at where we think is the right level. Always tuning at the margin for how we're incrementally funding and kind of tuning the short-term FHLB borrowings at the cash level. But I think for the most part, that cash level is right sized right now. I think within the securities portfolio broadly, we'll continue to see the trend of moderately lower duration sequentially as we've been doing, frankly, the last 3 quarters in a row. And just continuing to preference liquidity.Operator(Operator Instructions) Our next question comes from the line of Ken Usdin with Jefferies.Kenneth Michael UsdinIs that just a follow-up on your NII '24 comments. And if you talked about earning asset growth. I'm just wondering if your balance sheet has been elevated this quarter a good amount. And I guess are you expecting as you look out further that deposit growth will continue to carry the overall balance sheet side forward? And kind of, I guess, how do you think about the wholesale funding part of the equation as a balancing act on that?Zachary J. WassermanYes. Terrific question. Broadly speaking, the answer is yes. So I believe that we will rate loan growth in line with deposit growth for the most parts. And I think that's what we'll see here in the back half of this year. That's my expectation what the trend is to 2024 as well. I tend to see a pretty stable but slightly lower the loan-to-deposit ratio here over the next couple of quarters. And just fundamentally match funding making sure we can one of those fundamental underlying factors that allows us to manage the deposit beta and the marginal margin that we're getting up on the loan as I noted earlier. So it's an important dynamic. The good thing, and I think we've talked about this in the past, is that we are coming to this cycle, and we're now operating, let's say, in 3 quarters of the innings and a pretty favorable position where we saw really attractive loan opportunities, we could, in fact, fund them with noncustomer sources of funding and increase loan-to-deposit ratio. But as not the default position for now. I think we're now, I think, getting loans and deposits growing at a pretty similar rate. It's quite healthy and a good balance for us.Kenneth Michael UsdinOkay. And a follow-up, can you try to help us understand how the benefits from the security swaps look this quarter? And then as you go forward into next year, just your loan hedges, does that become a part of the benefit next year in terms of getting that NII starting to move the right way?Zachary J. WassermanYes, it does. Great question, Ken. Let me elaborate on that. So up through the only part of Q3, inclusive of activities we've done in the first few weeks of this quarter, we've got around $29 billion of downgrade hedge protection through -- received fixed swaps it's around $21 billion, $22 billion. We've got some floor spreads, which pay off under downgrade scenarios and then a portfolio of collars, which will the option to enter into received fixed swaps in the future. And likely will, if rates continue to trend generally what they're expected to. So it's a pretty powerful portfolio that both extent now and even more than will be extent over the coming 6 to 12 months as we enter into those color-based RSG fixed loss. The impact, obviously, I mean, the challenge in hedging right now is that with an inverted yield curve and by me, with a fairly steep decline already forecasted, you've got some pretty dire downgrade scenarios to convince yourself that makes sense to incrementally entree things right now, given that they carry right now. What we are experiencing in the P&amp;L at this moment is about 15 basis points of negative NIM drag from the receipt fix that we're already in. And that will go into essentially 0 by the end of 2024, if you follow out the forward yield curve scenarios. So that's 15 basis points of tailwind which we should see between now and the end of '24, fairly ratable clawback throughout that period.OperatorOur next question comes from the line of Jon Arfstrom with RBC Capital Markets.Jon Glenn ArfstromA couple of credit questions. First of all, congratulations -- congratulations, Rich, on your retirement. Done a great job, and I've enjoyed your perspective on these calls. Commercial real estate and consumer question. So on commercial real estate, how far ahead can you guys look in terms of identifying future issues? I know it's been a focus for you guys to tighten things up. But curious what you're doing now, and it obviously looks very clean, but you have a fair amount of reserves allocated to the business, and that's kind of why I ask.Richard A. PohleYes. We're looking -- we're focused primarily right now on the 2023 and 2024 impacts. And it's really hard to look much further beyond that. So we're doing quarterly portfolio reviews in office. We're touching the real estate book every month. I think we've probably gone through 90% of the loans over $5 million in that book at this point. But the focus is on '23 and '24 and managing what we can control, and that really relates to the maturities. And then particularly with respect to office, the lease rollovers that might be impacting cash flow in this year and next. So that's the primary focus. Beyond that, it's tough. You mentioned the 9% reserve. We've got against softness. We've got a 3.4% reserver against overall prebook. We feel for what we know right now, both of those are adequate, and we'll continue to look at those on a quarter-by-quarter basis.Stephen D. SteinourJon, Rich is also with the team getting long rebalanced wherever there appear to be issues that are proactive efforts to try to get those addressed paydowns, (inaudible) Almost of the efforts -- the primary focus is '23 '24. But there's also a long view full view of the portfolio over the next decade and other related issues, all of which are -- we're actively managing. We've been doing that for over a year and trying to stay well ahead of any issues may occur at this point to put in really good shape.Jon Glenn ArfstromIt seems that way. Okay. And then on consumer, I look at this every quarter, just your nonaccruals and charge-offs, and it's just kind of -- it's nothing really. Maybe it goes to the soft landing comments, but you look at RV marine consumer categories, delinquencies really haven't budged. Are you seeing anything in consumer health that bothers you at all because it's just -- these numbers are really, really good. .Richard A. PohleNo, the numbers are really good. And I think it goes to the client selection and just the focus that we've got on prime and super prime. If you look across the entire consumer spectrum. There's really nothing in there that would lead you to believe that we're going to have anything more than just a gradual return what might be more normalized levels of charge-offs. Because right now, to your point, they're running extremely low. The only area that I would point out that's a little bit relatively higher stress than the rest of the book is and that's because of the floating rate nature of that portfolio. So it's going to lead to a little higher level of delinquencies than you might see across the book, but the analysis that we've done from a vintage standpoint, on that book show that we're in the 55% to 60% loan-to-value range. So even though we might see higher levels of delinquency. We don't think the losses will follow.Stephen D. SteinourHousing markets are generally tight where we are, John. So if someone has -- and unemployment is very low. So if someone has an issue, the best resolution is to sell a property, unlike what we might have seen in '08, '09 or prior (inaudible).Just to give Rich a little credit here and recognition. We've been at an effort to outperform our peers for over a decade with this aggregate moderate to low risk profile, and he's been very, very disciplined about that. And we expect to outperform through the cycle. We've been sharing that all along. At this point, really, really good in that regard and a tribute to all my comments especially Rich and his leadership.Jon Glenn ArfstromYes, I agree. Steve, I was thinking you could give them a fishing boat or an RV out of the foreclosure pull there's anything to give.Stephen D. SteinourWe just don't have any other assets. On my lunch at some at posters. We pull those out.Jon Glenn ArfstromJust to clean up for you, Zach. The $60 million to $50 million on the Capstone, Torana. What drove that? I know it's small $10 million, but what happened there?Zachary J. WassermanYes. And Julie, that's reflective of -- the cost that we see in that previous $60 million was mainly Capstone, and has a factor of production and revenues that flow through into compensation expense. And so when capital markets revenues were a bit softer in the second quarter, our outlook somewhat lower than was originally budgeted into the back half of the year, so proud, which is less flow through into less cost. That's basically it.Jon Glenn ArfstromOkay. And then the $30 million FDIC, that's all in the third quarter. Is that correct?Zachary J. WassermanSo let me clarify that it's really important one. That FDIC expense that we talked about in that guidance is the 2 basis points higher assessment that is being assessed across the industry and that was known late last year, and it's coming through every quarter. It's not the special assessment that's still being discussed.OperatorLadies and gentlemen, this concludes our question-and-answer session. I'll turn the floor back to Mr. Steinour for any final comments.Stephen D. SteinourWell, thank you very much for joining us today. We're very pleased with the second quarter results as we dynamically manage through this unique environment. As you heard, we're very well positioned for times such as these with strong credit quality, improving capital ratios and robust liquidity. The deposit, both in particular in strangler nature has served us very, very well as head of our efforts to provide customer service and generate great satisfaction over the years. And we have a team of disciplined operators, and we are executing our strategy that we outlined last year at our Investor Day, which provides are driving value for our shareholders. And just as a reminder, the Board of Executives and our colleagues were all top 10 shareholders collectively.

In most of our consumer portfolios, delinquencies are actually at or better than last year at the same time.""U.S. consumersare still keeping up with their loan paymentsdespite rising costs and a worsening economic outlook, according to executives at the largest U.S. lenders.Huntington's shares were up 0.3% in afternoon trading.A rate hike campaign by the U.S. Federal Reserve has allowed lenders to charge higher interests on loans, bolstering their net interest income (NII) - the difference between what banks earn via lending and pay out on deposits.Huntington's NII jumped 7% to $1.35 billion, helping offset the hit from provisions for credit losses that rose 37% to $92 million in the three months ended June 30.Total commercial loans in the quarter were $68.14 billion, up 6% from last year.However, Columbus, Ohio-based Huntington lowered its forecast for annual NII growth, mirroring moves by some of its peers suggesting that high borrowing costs could begin to weigh on loan demand later in the year.The bank now expects NII to increase between 3% and 5% in 2023, compared to its prior forecast of a 6% to 9% growth.""The interest rate outlook has continued to change,"" said Steinour, adding there are expectations that rates will remain higher for a longer period.""Demand is slowing in some categories, businesses are managing their working capital tighter. There's been a lot of volatility.""Story continuesComerica and Fifth Third Bancorp have also trimmed full-year NII growth forecasts.Huntington earned $0.35 per share in the second quarter versus analysts' average estimate of $0.34 per share, according to Refinitiv IBES data.Deposits at banks have largely stabilized after a series of bank runs earlier this year.Total deposits at Huntington were $148 billion, up nearly 2% from the first quarter.(Reporting by Niket Nishant in Bengaluru and Saeed Azhar in New York; Editing by Shweta Agarwal and Deepa Babington)]"

The metric remained flat from the prior-year figure.The results have benefited from increases in net interest income (NII) and non-interest income. However, a rise in expenses and higher provision for credit losses were headwinds.The company has reported a net income applicable to common shares of $519 million in the quarter, up 1.6% year over year.Revenues Rise, Expenses EscalateTotal revenues (on a fully-taxable equivalent or FTE basis) climbed 5.7% year over year to $1.85 billion in the second quarter. Also, the top line surpassed the consensus estimate of $1.84 billion.NII (FTE basis) was $1.36 billion, up 6.7% from the prior-year quarter. The upside was driven by an increase in average earning assets partially offset by a decline in net interest margin (NIM). NIM decreased 4 basis points to 3.11% in the quarter under review.Non-interest income moved up 2.1% year over year to $495 million. The rise mainly stemmed from higher card and payment processing income, capital market fees, and income from trust and investment management services partially offset by lower service charges on deposit accounts, mortgage banking income and leasing revenues.Non-interest expenses were up 3.1% year over year to $1.05 billion. This was majorly due to a rise in personnel costs, equipment expenditures, marketing fees, professional services as well as deposit and other insurance expenses.The efficiency ratio was 55.9%, down from the prior-year quarter’s 57.3%. A decline in the ratio indicates a rise in profitability.As of Jun 30, 2023, average loans and leases at Huntington improved 1% on a sequential basis to $121.35 billion. However, average total deposits declined marginally to $145.6 billion.Credit Quality DeterioratesNet charge-offs were $49 million or an annualized 0.16% of average total loans and leases in the reported quarter, up from $8 million or 0.03% recorded in the prior year. The quarter-end allowance for credit losses increased 8% to $2.34 billion. In the second quarter, the company recorded a provision for credit losses of $92 million compared with $67 million in the year-ago quarter.Story continuesNonetheless, total non-performing assets were $557 million as of Jun 30, 2023, down from $682 million in the prior-year quarter.Capital Ratios SolidThe common equity tier 1 risk-based capital ratio was 9.82% in the quarter compared with 9.05% in the year-ago period. The regulatory Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio was 11.58%, up from 10.63% in the comparable period in 2022. The tangible common equity to tangible assets ratio in the second quarter was 5.80%, flat from the prior-year quarter.Our ViewpointHuntington’s elevated non-interest expenses are likely to keep the bottom line under pressure in the upcoming period.

Given the economic uncertainties, consumers are now more selective and price conscious, which is reflected in the comparatively lower consumer discretionary spending on a year-over-year basis.Meanwhile, the bottom line of Wyndham is likely to have been affected by the persisting inflation, increased interest expenses and high costs. The higher cost environment is expected to have put pressure on the company’s margins.Furthermore, the company’s increasing global development pipeline is likely to have partially offset the impacts of the aforementioned headwinds. Increase in royalties and franchise fees, as well as marketing, reservation and loyalty revenues, are likely to have aided the company’s performance.For the mentioned quarter, the Zacks Consensus Estimates for royalties and franchise fees, as well as marketing, reservation and loyalty (under the fee-related and other revenues) revenues, are pegged at $147 million and $153 million, up 10.5% and 5.5% year over year, respectively.For the second quarter, the consensus estimate for global RevPAR is pegged at $46.79, portraying 5.7% growth from the prior year reported figure.Story continuesWhat the Zacks Model UnveilsOur proven model does not conclusively predict an earnings beat for WH this time around.

If you want to see more stocks in this selection, check out 5 Cheap Travel Stocks to Buy Now.Revenge travel is the new phenomenon as travelers try to compensate for the lost time and opportunity over the last two years due COVID-19 restrictions. Opening of borders and easing of restrictions even in China is the catalyst behind the 11% annual online travel market growth rate. The segment has seen a spike in tourists searching and booking various travel services, including hotel and Airbnb accommodations, flights, cars, tours, and cruises.Booking Holdings Inc. (NASDAQ:BKNG) is one of the companies benefiting from the surge in airline demand, with its stock up by about 40% year to date. Tripadvisor Inc. (NASDAQ:TRIP) and Expedia Group Inc. (NASDAQ:EXPE) are other stocks flying high as more people worldwide make travel arrangements to try and make up for the lost time following the Covid 19 pandemic. The companies are benefiting from a rebound in travel to urban centers, with some of the biggest cities in the world experiencing a significant uptick in tourists.Solo trips were a thing at the height of the pandemic due to the need for minimal interaction to avert contracting or spreading the virus. Nevertheless, solo trips hurt the travel industry due to reduced revenues. Fast forward, there is a significant decrease in solo trips, with people opting to travel in large packs, which benefits most companies in the segment.Even though most Americans are fearful that the economic situation will worsen and therefore cut back on expenditure, there was a 47% increase in people traveling in the U.S. compared to the second quarter of last year. Despite the cautious sentiment around finances, wary of the economic situation, people are still making travel arrangements and spending big in the process.According to Calvin Li of JLL Hotels &amp; Hospitality, sentiments in the travel industry have improved significantly.Story continues“Everyone thought, Rates will decline. This is just a blip. Everyone's traveling now, but it's going to dissipate. That hasn't happened. It hasn't happened in Asia. It hasn't happened in the U.S. or Europe. So, investors are a little bit more confident now that they have more data on their fingertips,” Li said in an interview with CNBC.Experts are already predicting a booming travel demand in 2023, with 26% of Americans planning to increase their spending on leisure travel. Additionally, 53% of all Americans and 81% of leisure travelers have already made arrangements to travel over the next six months.Technological advancement also significantly impacts the travel industry and is one of the catalysts behind robust growth. The thought of queueing for long hours in airports and losing luggage deterred many people from traveling. However, not anymore. Tech solutions like biometric identification are becoming common in airports, making it easy to check in and out.Techniques such as facial recognition and iris scans have enhanced airport screening, enabling after-passenger processing. For instance, the Dubai international airport has implemented biometric Smart Gate tunnels that allow travelers to verify their identity within seconds.12 Cheap Travel Stocks to Buy NowPixabay/Public DomainOn the other hand, Chief financial officers and other executives in the hospitality and travel industry are prioritizing investments in I.T. to stay ahead of the curve and enhance customer experience. According to Li, there is also increased focus on ESG as stakeholders’ shareholders and guests demand owners to be held accountable to recap carbon-neutral targets.While inflation levels are still high, travel costs have eased significantly with airline tickets down, thus helping attract most people into traveling. While the focus has always been on big players in the travel and tourism industry, little-known gems are poised to benefit from the expected travel boom.With the interest rate cycles stabilizing and inflation abating in developed markets, expectations are high of increased investments as demand for risk grows. Now could be the best time to scan for cheap travel stocks to buy as high net-worth investors and corporates on the sidelines join the party.Our Methodology For this article, we first used the Finviz stock screener to find the list of the cheap travel stocks to buy now. From a lengthy list of stocks, we filtered and focused on those with an Upside Potential of 10% or higher. Our analysis is also based on the hedge fund sentiment gathered from Insider Monkey's database, which tracks 943 elite hedge funds as of the conclusion of the first quarter of 2023. The stocks were then ranked based on their upside potential.12. Wynn Resorts, Limited (NASDAQ:WYNN)Upside Potential: 14.79% Price target: $124.27 Number of Hedge Fund Holders:46Wynn Resorts, Limited (NASDAQ:WYNN) has been flying high, rallying by about 32% year to date even on facing a shaky economy, persistent inflation, and high-interest rates. Nevertheless, the company has continued to deliver impressive results from its core business of designing, developing, and operating integrated resorts. It’s one of the companies benefiting from a bounce back of the travel and tourism industry. Occupancy levels at its hotels and casino are above 80%. The company reinstating its dividend has also made it a Wall Street darling.Likewise, analysts have a $124.27 price target on Wynn Resorts, Limited (NASDAQ:WYNN), implying a 14.79% upside potential from current levels. In the first quarter of 2023, 46 hedge funds had a stake in Wynn Resorts, Limited (NASDAQ:WYNN) compared to 36 in the previous quarter. In Q1, the company’s biggest hedge fund holder, Citadel Investment Group owned 1.12 million shares of the company worth $125.52 million.Baron Funds made the following comment about Wynn Resorts, Limited (NASDAQ:WYNN) in its first quarter 2023 investor letter:“In the first quarter of 2023, we re-acquired shares in Macau-centric casino gaming companies Wynn Resorts, Limited (NASDAQ:WYNN) and Las Vegas Sands Corporation with the following considerations in mind:Since the early days of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 through mid-2022, the shares of Wynn and Las Vegas Sands significantly underperformed the share price performance of other U.S.-centric casino gaming and lodging companies due in large part to extremely limited travel mobility to Macau during China’s Zero-COVID policy. Just as business activity and the shares of U.S.-centric casino gaming companies rebounded sharply once people felt comfortable to travel to Las Vegas and other U.S. regional gaming markets, we have felt that Macau business activity and the shares of Macau-centric casino gaming companies would follow in the footsteps of Las Vegas-centric and other U.S. gaming and lodging companies and inflect positively once people were permitted to travel to Macau more freely.…” (Click here to read the full text)11. MGM Resorts International (NYSE:MGM)Upside Potential: 17.10% Price target: $58.42 Number of Hedge Fund Holders:54MGM Resorts International (NYSE:MGM) is another cheap travel stock to buy now, as it operates casino hotels and entertainment resorts in the U.S. and Macau.

Central banks in Europe, Japan and the United States are due to hold policy meetings next week, with the dollar steadying on bets of the Federal Reserve keeping rates higher for longer following evidence of labor market resilience. ""The reason for that weakening all across the board is you know, by now it is very clear that the European Central Bank, the Bank of England, along with the Federal Reserve are going to continue hiking,"" said Juan Perez, director of trading at Monex. In Latin America, top copper producer Chile's peso was knocked down 0.7% by lower prices of the red metal. Peru's sol dropped 0.1% as traders continued to assess the impact of recent anti-government protests on the future of President Dina Boluarte. Deustche Bank analysts said the El Nino climate phenomenon and apparent renewal of socio-political unrest are clouding Peru's economic outlook and policy response. These developments could set back the country's economic recovery and generate inflationary pressures. Meanwhile, the Mexican peso slipped 0.6% and was set for weekly losses a day after dropping more than 1% on weak retail sales data. Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador's verbal attacks on Senator Xochitl Galvez have raised the charismatic opposition lawmaker's profile and fueled concerns among some ruling party supporters that the country's leader is undermining his own party instead of derailing her presidential campaign. Colombia's peso advanced 0.6%, aided by higher prices of crude oil, while Brazil's real rose 0.5%. The MSCI index for Latin American currencies edged higher for the second straight week, while Peru's sol tracked its worst week since May. The MSCI index for Latin American stocks gained 1.1%, set for a third straight weekly gain, led by Brazilian equities. B3 was the top boost, gaining some 4% as the company's stock options expired on Friday. Elsewhere, Russia's central bank surprised markets with a greater-than-expected 100-basis-point interest rate hike. The rouble weakened against the dollar following the rate hike after the currency's weakness added to inflation pressures stemming from a tight labor market and strong consumer demand.

The run-up comes amid Saudi and Russian rhetoric about production cuts — an additional one million barrels per day each for the kingdom and half a million a day pledged by Moscow — as well as receding inflation data that suggested the Federal Reserve will be less aggressive with interest rates going forth.WTI may consolidate under $77 next weekNotwithstanding those gains, the market has had trouble reaching beyond the OPEC target of $80 and above due to dismal growth data out of China, the world’s largest importer of oil, and spotty demand for gasoline in top oil consumer the United States — despite the advent of summer travel, which usually results in runaway usage of fuels.Story continues“Next week, energy traders will have to pay attention to global flash PMI readings, a handful of major energy companies earnings, the standard weekly stockpile data points and some energy conferences which could provide some insight for the future shifts with supply and demand,"" said Ed Moya, analyst at online trading platform OANDA.

Thus more stimulus is likely.Tightening supply to boost pricesAlso helping the tone is the theory that oil markets will tighten significantly in the second half of the year, boosting prices.Two major producers, Saudi Arabia and Russia have already announced additional production cuts, starting in August.""The supply deficit that had been looming in the second half of the year is now backed up by hard figures,"" said analysts at Commerzbank, in a note, citing recent data indicating China and India's imports of crude oil from Russia had hit an all-time high in June.U.S. Inventories fell less than expected last week, according to data from the Energy Information Administration, but the data also included a jump in crude exports as customers sought out crude from all sources.U.S. growth forecast upgradedOn the demand side, Morgan Stanley lifted its forecast of U.S. real gross domestic product growth to 1.3% in 2023, from an earlier forecast of up 0.6%, citing a strong industrial sector and more public investment in infrastructure.Story continuesThe Federal Reserve's widely-expected interest rate hike at its upcoming policy meeting next week is likely to be ""the last"" of its long-running tightening cycle, according to analysts at Goldman Sachs.This means the U.S. economy, the largest in the world and major energy consumer, is less likely to fall into recession in the second half of the year.Related ArticlesCrude oil higher; supply tightness, Chinese stimulus eyedWorld Bank's IFC considers $1.5 billion in investments in Ukraine banking, farming, infrastructureRussia hits Ukraine's grain for fourth day, practises seizing ships]"

This takes the dividend yield to 3.6%, which shareholders will be pleased with. Check out our latest analysis for Morgan Stanley Morgan Stanley's Earnings Easily Cover The DistributionsWe like to see robust dividend yields, but that doesn't matter if the payment isn't sustainable. Based on the last payment, Morgan Stanley's earnings were much higher than the dividend, but it wasn't converting those earnings into cash flow. No cash flows could definitely make returning cash to shareholders difficult, or at least mean the balance sheet will come under pressure.Looking forward, earnings per share is forecast to rise by 36.7% over the next year. Assuming the dividend continues along recent trends, we think the payout ratio could be 50% by next year, which is in a pretty sustainable range.historic-dividendMorgan Stanley Has A Solid Track RecordThe company has a sustained record of paying dividends with very little fluctuation. The dividend has gone from an annual total of $0.20 in 2013 to the most recent total annual payment of $3.40. This works out to be a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of approximately 33% a year over that time. So, dividends have been growing pretty quickly, and even more impressively, they haven't experienced any notable falls during this period.We Could See Morgan Stanley's Dividend GrowingSome investors will be chomping at the bit to buy some of the company's stock based on its dividend history. Morgan Stanley has seen EPS rising for the last five years, at 7.4% per annum. While on an earnings basis, this company looks appealing as an income stock, the cash payout ratio still makes us cautious.In SummaryIn summary, while it's always good to see the dividend being raised, we don't think Morgan Stanley's payments are rock solid. With cash flows lacking, it is difficult to see how the company can sustain a dividend payment. We would be a touch cautious of relying on this stock primarily for the dividend income.Story continuesMarket movements attest to how highly valued a consistent dividend policy is compared to one which is more unpredictable. Still, investors need to consider a host of other factors, apart from dividend payments, when analysing a company.

Meanwhile, the Dow gained 0.01%, and the Nasdaq, a tech-heavy index, lost 1.37%.Prior to today's trading, shares of the customer-management software developer had gained 6.97% over the past month. This has outpaced the Computer and Technology sector's gain of 1.16% and the S&amp;P 500's gain of 3.43% in that time.Investors will be hoping for strength from Salesforce.com as it approaches its next earnings release. The company is expected to report EPS of $1.90, up 59.66% from the prior-year quarter. Meanwhile, our latest consensus estimate is calling for revenue of $8.52 billion, up 10.41% from the prior-year quarter.For the full year, our Zacks Consensus Estimates are projecting earnings of $7.44 per share and revenue of $34.63 billion, which would represent changes of +41.98% and +10.46%, respectively, from the prior year.Any recent changes to analyst estimates for Salesforce.com should also be noted by investors. These revisions help to show the ever-changing nature of near-term business trends. As a result, we can interpret positive estimate revisions as a good sign for the company's business outlook.Research indicates that these estimate revisions are directly correlated with near-term share price momentum. Investors can capitalize on this by using the Zacks Rank. This model considers these estimate changes and provides a simple, actionable rating system.The Zacks Rank system ranges from #1 (Strong Buy) to #5 (Strong Sell). It has a remarkable, outside-audited track record of success, with #1 stocks delivering an average annual return of +25% since 1988.

Salesforce.com currently has a Zacks Rank of #1 (Strong Buy).Digging into valuation, Salesforce.com currently has a Forward P/E ratio of 30.68. Its industry sports an average Forward P/E of 29.12, so we one might conclude that Salesforce.com is trading at a premium comparatively.Story continuesMeanwhile, CRM's PEG ratio is currently 1.59.

While this widely-known consensus outlook is important in gauging the company's earnings picture, a powerful factor that could impact its near-term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates.The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report, which is expected to be released on July 28. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations, it's worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise.Zacks Consensus EstimateThis equipment maker for the energy sector is expected to post quarterly earnings of $0.94 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +6.8%.Revenues are expected to be $981.8 million, up 142.5% from the year-ago quarter.Estimate Revisions TrendThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 3.74% lower over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change.Earnings WhisperEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. Our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) -- has this insight at its core.The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Story continuesThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Chart Industries?For Chart Industries, the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of -3.52%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #3.So, this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Chart Industries will beat the consensus EPS estimate.Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?While calculating estimates for a company's future earnings, analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that Chart Industries would post earnings of $0.36 per share when it actually produced earnings of $1.41, delivering a surprise of +291.67%.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times.Bottom LineAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.Chart Industries doesn't appear a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.An Industry Player's Expected ResultsFlowserve (FLS), another stock in the Zacks Manufacturing - General Industrial industry, is expected to report earnings per share of $0.40 for the quarter ended June 2023. This estimate points to a year-over-year change of +33.3%. Revenues for the quarter are expected to be $982.06 million, up 11.3% from the year-ago quarter.Over the last 30 days, the consensus EPS estimate for Flowserve has been revised 1.5% up to the current level. Nevertheless, the company now has an Earnings ESP of -5.91%, reflecting a lower Most Accurate Estimate.When combined with a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold), this Earnings ESP makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Flowserve will beat the consensus EPS estimate. Over the last four quarters, the company surpassed consensus EPS estimates three times.Stay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

In August of 2020, PG&amp;E had just 6.5 megawatts (MW) of battery energy storage connected to the power grid. By September this year, it expects to have 1,700 MW online, or enough to meet the instantaneous demand of 1.2 million homes at once. PG&amp;E has contracts for battery energy storage systems totaling more than 3,000 MW to be deployed over the next few years.""PG&amp;E is working with the state's energy agencies and doing our part to help ensure safe and reliable electric service this summer. We're continuing to bring online new resources like battery energy storage, including an additional 700 MW than we had available to serve customers last summer,"" said Gillian Clegg, PG&amp;E Vice President, Energy, Policy and Procurement.PG&amp;E also is modifying and expanding existing Demand Response (DR) programs which help reduce energy demand. These programs offer financial incentives for residential and business customers who reduce their energy use during peak demand times. PG&amp;E finds it can reduce energy demand on the grid by up to 900 MW, or the equivalent instantaneous demand of approximately 650,000 homes, through its load management programs and contracts, when large numbers of customers participate.Boost from More Hydroelectric PowerCalifornians can count on more hydroelectric power this summer. According to the California Department of Water Resources, many parts of the state received precipitation levels this year that were 100 to over 200% of average. The state also had the largest snowpack since 1983. Storage in PG&amp;E's 16 largest reservoirs is approximately 109% of average for this time of year.Story continuesPG&amp;E expects to have adequate hydropower to help meet peak summer demand periods. Hydropower is a cost-effective form of power generation, especially in wet years. An abundance of hydropower this year will help offset some of the need for other higher cost generation.Customers Can Support the Grid, Save Energy and MoneyThroughout the summer months, PG&amp;E is sharing information with its customers about how they can take action to help reduce energy demand during hot, summer days when energy demand rises.A few simple steps customers can consider:Put off energy-intensive chores like washing dishes and laundry until off-peak hours, before 4 p.m. and after 9 p.m. every day.Install and use a programmable thermostat. These devices allow you to cool your home during times when energy is less in demand and less expensive.Sign up for CAISO Flex Alerts which are calls for conservation during peak energy demand hours.Enroll in the Power Saver Rewards Program for residential customers. Over 1.6 million customers are enrolled in the free program, which rewards customers for temporarily reducing energy use when the CAISO calls a Flex Alert. Customers earn $2 for each kilowatt-hour of energy saved.

We expect to observe this trend in the second-quarter results as well. Such reduced O&amp;M expenses, along with solid sales growth, are likely to have boosted PCG’s overall bottom-line performance.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for second-quarter earnings is pegged at 30 cents per share, implying year-over-year growth of 20%.What the Zacks Model UnveilsOur proven model does not conclusively predict an earnings beat for PG&amp;E this time around.

But as Peter Lynch said in One Up On Wall Street, 'Long shots almost never pay off.' A loss-making company is yet to prove itself with profit, and eventually the inflow of external capital may dry up.In contrast to all that, many investors prefer to focus on companies like Motorola Solutions (NYSE:MSI), which has not only revenues, but also profits. Now this is not to say that the company presents the best investment opportunity around, but profitability is a key component to success in business. Check out our latest analysis for Motorola Solutions How Quickly Is Motorola Solutions Increasing Earnings Per Share?If you believe that markets are even vaguely efficient, then over the long term you'd expect a company's share price to follow its earnings per share (EPS) outcomes. So it makes sense that experienced investors pay close attention to company EPS when undertaking investment research. Motorola Solutions managed to grow EPS by 15% per year, over three years. That's a good rate of growth, if it can be sustained.It's often helpful to take a look at earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) margins, as well as revenue growth, to get another take on the quality of the company's growth. Motorola Solutions maintained stable EBIT margins over the last year, all while growing revenue 13% to US$9.4b. That's a real positive.You can take a look at the company's revenue and earnings growth trend, in the chart below. For finer detail, click on the image.earnings-and-revenue-historyOf course the knack is to find stocks that have their best days in the future, not in the past. You could base your opinion on past performance, of course, but you may also want to check this interactive graph of professional analyst EPS forecasts for Motorola Solutions.Are Motorola Solutions Insiders Aligned With All Shareholders?Since Motorola Solutions has a market capitalisation of US$50b, we wouldn't expect insiders to hold a large percentage of shares. But we do take comfort from the fact that they are investors in the company. We note that their impressive stake in the company is worth US$161m. We note that this amounts to 0.3% of the company, which may be small owing to the sheer size of Motorola Solutions but it's still worth mentioning. This should still be a great incentive for management to maximise shareholder value.Story continuesDoes Motorola Solutions Deserve A Spot On Your Watchlist?One important encouraging feature of Motorola Solutions is that it is growing profits. If that's not enough on its own, there is also the rather notable levels of insider ownership. The combination definitely favoured by investors so consider keeping the company on a watchlist. We don't want to rain on the parade too much, but we did also find 2 warning signs for Motorola Solutions that you need to be mindful of.Although Motorola Solutions certainly looks good, it may appeal to more investors if insiders were buying up shares.

Driving this momentum has been a combination of favorable developments on the macro front, primarily growing clarity surrounding the Fed’s tightening cycle, optimism about the impact of artificial intelligence (AI) that some view warily as reminders of the late 1990s, and an emerging sense that the worst of Tech spending headwinds is either behind us or close to that stage.With many Tech companies on deck to report June-quarter results this week, the market will be looking for more color on business spending trends, particularly on the cloud side. A big part of Tech’s improved earnings outlook over the last few months has been a function of more effective cost controls that have helped stabilize margins.Improved clarity on top-line trends will help solidify the nascent favorable revisions trend and undergird the group’s impressive stock market momentum.Surrounding it all is the AI debate, where we have already seen direct revenue impact from the likes of Nvidia NVDA and some ideas from Microsoft MSFT. Still, the innovation’s productivity-enhancing potential appears to be some ways off in the future.That said, the stock market is essentially a discounting system of the future. To the extent that we see viable business models in the days ahead that make use of AI, the so-called large language models beyond Nvidia selling more capable chips, and Microsoft starting to charge for new AI-driven bells and whistles in its Office productivity suite, the stock market excitement would be totally justified.These topics will be front and center in this week’s earnings reports from three of the ‘Big 7 Tech players’. Alphabet GOOGL and Microsoft MSFT report after the market’s close on Tuesday (7/25), and Instagram parent Meta Platforms META reports after the close on Wednesday (7/26). Of the remaining four members of this ‘club,’ Tesla has reported already, and Amazon, Apple, and Nvidia are not reporting this week.Story continuesThe chart below shows the year-to-date stock market performance of the Zacks Technology sector (third from the bottom; up +38.7%), the S&amp;P 500 index (bottom line; up +18.9%), Alphabet (second from the bottom; up +36.3%), Microsoft (second from the top; up +44.6%), and Meta (top line; up +147.2%).Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchDigital advertising has historically been seen as core to Alphabet and Meta, but Amazon has steadily become a major player in the space as well. Ad spending likely remained stable in Q2, but it will be interesting to see how these management teams see trends for the current and coming periods, given the macroeconomic uncertainties. This will also be at play in the Snap SNAP report, which also reports Q2 results on Tuesday (7/25) this week.All of these companies are big players in the artificial intelligence (AI) space, with the Microsoft vs. Alphabet rivalry particularly intense. With the initial excitement around ChatGPT and other AI applications now behind us, the questions now center around how these AI capabilities will be monetized through new and existing business models. It is reasonable to expect each of these management teams to spend considerable time on their Q2 earnings calls on their AI plan.Take a look at the chart below that shows current consensus expectations for the ‘Big 7 Tech Players’ as a whole for the current and coming periods in the context of what they achieved in the preceding period.As you can see, the group is expected to have +14.7% higher earnings in 2023 Q2 on +8% higher revenues. This would follow the -2.5% drop in earnings on +4.9% higher revenues in 2023 Q1.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchPlease note that the +14.7% earnings growth and +8% revenue growth in Q2 today is up from +4% earnings growth and +4.3% revenue growth expected for the group three months back. As with Q2, estimates for full-year 2023 have notably increased as well.The chart below that shows the group’s earnings and revenue growth on an annual basis.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchThe group’s phenomenal boost in 2021 partly reflected pulled forward demand from future periods that was in the process of getting adjusted last year and this year. As you can see above, the expectation is for the group to resume ‘regular/normal’ growth next year, but a lot of that is contingent on how the macroeconomic picture unfolds.Beyond these mega-cap players, total Q2 earnings for the Technology sector as a whole are expected to be down -4.4% from the same period last year on -0.1% lower revenues.The chart below shows the sector’s Q2 earnings and revenue growth expectations in the context of where growth has been in recent quarters and what is expected in the coming four periods.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchThis big-picture view of the ‘Big 7 players’ and the sector as a whole shows that the worst of the growth challenge is shifting into the rearview mirror. You can see this clearly in the chart below.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchPlease note that the -1.9% earnings decline expected for the sector is less than half of the -4.8% decline expected three months back.The Earnings Big PictureRegular readers of our earnings commentary know that we have consistently been flagging a favorable turn in the revisions trend since the start of 2023 Q2, with earnings estimates stabilizing in the aggregate after consistently coming down for almost a year and actually starting to go up for some key sectors.This combination of favorable macroeconomic developments and optimism about the transformational power of artificial intelligence (AI) appears to be driving market optimism.To get a sense of what is currently expected, take a look at the chart below that shows current earnings and revenue growth expectations for the S&amp;P 500 index for 2023 Q2, the following three quarters, and actual results for the preceding four quarters.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchAs you can see in this chart, Q2 is on track to be the third quarter in a row of earnings declines and the first quarter of declining revenues. We should point out here that a big part of the earnings and revenue weakness is due to the Energy sector. Excluding the Energy sector drag, Q2 earnings would be down -2.9% on +3.1% higher revenues.The chart below shows the year-over-year change in net income margins for the S&amp;P 500 index.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchAs you can see above, 2023 Q2 will be the 6th consecutive quarter of declining margins for the S&amp;P 500 index.Margins in Q2 are expected to be below the year-earlier level for 12 of the 16 Zacks sectors, with the biggest margin pressure expected to be in the Basic Materials, Construction, Energy, Medical, Conglomerates, Autos, Aerospace, and Tech sectors.On the positive side, the Finance sector is the only one expected to experience significant margin gains, with the Consumer Discretionary and Transportation sectors as distant second and third. Sectors expected to be essentially flat regarding margins relative to 2022 Q2 are Retail, Utilities, and Industrial Products.The chart below shows the earnings and revenue growth picture on an annual basis.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchAs noted earlier, the estimate revisions trend has notably stabilized since the start of Q2. In the aggregate, S&amp;P 500 earnings estimates for 2023 have declined -1.2% since the beginning of April but only -0.3% on an ex-Energy basis. Importantly, estimates for sectors like Tech, Construction, Autos, and Transportation have increased in that timeframe.Q2 Earnings ScorecardWe get into the heart of the Q2 earnings season, with more than 650 companies on deck to report results, including 165 S&amp;P 500 members or one-third of the index’s total membership. With results from 89 index members already out through Friday, July 21st, we will have crossed the halfway mark in the Q2 reporting cycle by the end of this week.Total Q2 earnings for the 89 S&amp;P 500 members are up +3.4% from the same period last year on +8.5% higher revenues, with 78.7% beating EPS estimates and 60.7% beating revenue estimates.The comparison charts put the Q2 results from these 89 index members with what we had seen from the same group of companies in other recent periods.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchThe comparison charts below put the Q2 earnings and revenue growth rates for these 89 index members in a historical context.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchFor a detailed look at the overall earnings picture, including expectations for the coming periods, please check out our weekly Earnings Trends report &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Q2 Earnings Season Gets Off to a Positive Start   Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

With disruptive technologies, we see a seismic shift in conceptualizing productivity. Today's spotlight shines brightly on artificial intelligence, a pivotal element in the global productivity narrative.As underscored by McKinsey &amp; Company, breakthrough innovations like AI and automation are no longer potential game-changers they are redefining the game entirely. These technologies have surged to the forefront of the global economy by bolstering productivity, yet the path forward is not without hurdles. There have been bumps in the road as individuals grapple with the new nuances that AI-driven protocols bring.Digitalization and investmentMSFT 15-Year Financial DataThe intrinsic value of MSFTPeter Lynch Chart of MSFTA recurring motif in this narrative is digitalization, a force that persistently shapes our physical and virtual workplaces. Investing in AI techonology, therefore, is not a mere trend or a fleeting buzzword; it is an investment in the future of work and productivity.As we delve deeper into this paradigm shift, we must remember that tech investing is a double-edged sword. As much as it has the potential to revolutionize the business world, it also has its unique set of challenges that must be astutely managed.Investing in AI stocksInvesting in AI stocks can be prudent as these companies hold significant potential and deserve consideration in any well-rounded portfolio. Nonetheless, it is crucial to balance enthusiasm with prudence. Assessing their worth requires thorough research before adding them to your portfolio. To access the most up-to-date insights, one can utilize the comprehensive All-in-One Screener, a Premium feature provided by GuruFocus.With this perspective, let's explore the potential, the challenges and the future of investing in AI with two companies actively involved in the space.SnowflakeAs the world increasingly digitizes, Snowflake Inc. (NYSE:SNOW) emerges as a fascinating, albeit challenging, choice for investors. Amid a landscape where big data and AI continue to reshape the future of investing, this data cloud player has proven its mettle, delivering an impressive year-to-date return of over 36%.Story continuesSnowflake's financial results for its first quarter of fiscal 2024 highlighted a robust earnings beat by 197.4% and a promising product revenue growth forecast, ranging between $620 million to $625 million for the coming quarter. However, it was not all roses; while the company's revenue grew by 48% year over year, this pace was slower than the 85% surge in the prior-year fiscal quarter.Growth and challengesYet, with product revenue, the lion's share of Snowflake's sales, showing a 50% year-over-year expansion, the company still maintains a healthy growth curve. Being at the forefront of the data cloud domain, it holds tremendous potential to yield substantial returns in the long run.Nonetheless, the mere thought of growth deceleration is unbearable for investors. Consequently, the stock retains the capacity to experience rapid fluctuations within just a few sessionsvolatility that proves too much for most investors to withstand.Valuation and potentialUndeniably, Snowflake's lofty valuation, with a price-sales ratio of 26.3, might give investors pause. Yet a closer look at the figures reveals a rosier picture. The stock's performance has not caught up with its 48% revenue growth, effectively shrinking the multiple.With a unique positioning in the vast data cloud arena and a forecasted $2 trillion addressable public cloud market by 2026, Snowflake's narrative remains one of compelling growth and potential.MicrosoftHarnessing the potential of AI to spur growth, Microsoft Corp. (NASDAQ:MSFT) is painting a riveting portrait of success. This tech giant is confidently charting its course with a year-to-date return of a hefty 48.2%, capturing the attention of market watchers.The second-quarter earnings further confirm the company's compelling narrative. They reveal an impressive net income increase of 9.4% to $18.3 billion and a diluted earnings per share boost of 10.4%, comfortably beating the projected earnings by 9.8%.AI initiatives and cloud strategyShining in the spotlight, Microsoft's strategic investments in the burgeoning AI industry, notably its affiliation with OpenAI, have carved out new avenues to outpace competitors. The collaboration is already bearing fruit as ChatGPT, one of OpenAI's creations, rapidly amassed over a million users in just five days. Further leveraging this advantage, Microsoft has tactfully integrated AI into its Bing search engine, challenging Alphabet's (GOOG) (GOOGL) monopoly in the online search industry.Moreover, Microsoft is not a newcomer to AI-enabled services; its cloud-based AI initiatives are a testament to the company's futuristic vision. A seamless blend of AI and cloud computing, two sectors poised for stellar growth, has become a cornerstone of the company's ambitious strategy. As the second-largest player in the cloud market, boasting a commendable 23% market share, Microsoft's calculated gambits promise potentially lucrative returns in the coming decade.ValuationMicrosoft's valuation appears to be higher due to the promising catalysts that are anticipated. Investors are factoring in the stock's potential, resulting in its current price-sales ratio of 12.5. This figure is notably higher than the historical range observed over the past decade, with a minimum price-sales ratio of 3.1, a median of 6.7 and a maximum of 14.8. The elevated ratio signifies that investors have optimistic expectations for Microsoft's growth and revenue prospects, leading to the current premium in the share price.As we await the next earnings announcement, which is scheduled for July 25, Microsoft continues to underscore its proficiency in turning the AI wave into a worthwhile opportunity.This article first appeared on GuruFocus.]"

The tech giant will deliver its fiscal fourth quarter of 2023 statement (June quarter) on Tuesday (July 25) amidst strong optimism the company is only starting to benefit from the ongoing adoption of generative AI.As such, ahead of the print, Piper Sandler analyst Brent Bracelin sees a ‘solid’ set-up, given “1) robust Gen AI momentum, which could drive above-consensus capex guidance and help offset Azure optimization headwinds; 2) Azure growth that appears to be stabilizing (even before considering Azure AI services benefit); and 3) non-cloud segments that could show improvements.”Bracelin thinks the capex (capital expenditures) Microsoft is deploying to support the huge AI opportunity is much bigger than what the Street is factoring in. Gen AI “optimism and interest” underpin his FY24 $48 billion capex estimate, a Street high figure some distance above consensus at $32 billion and based on “aggressive capacity expansion plans to support an untapped AI opportunity.”A recent Piper Sandler CIO survey which showed growing enterprise interest in Gen AI + “robust spending intentions” on Azure and M365 only confirms his thesis, says Bracelin and offers “further confidence” that it is only the beginning of a Gen AI investment cycle the company is “well positioned to capitalize on.”Bracelin’s Gen AI bullishness is also based on 3P data. Data on web traffic for ChatGPT, GitHub, and Bing indicates widespread acceptance of Gen AI in both business and consumer domains. Both GitHub and Bing have experienced a significant surge in the number of average monthly users. In the June quarter, GitHub had over 300 million average monthly users, marking an 81% year-over-year increase, while Bing had over 460 million average monthly users, reflecting 35% growth. Although ChatGPT’s month-over-month growth rate has decreased after the initial hype, the web app still showed an impressive 580 million unique users in June.Story continuesDespite the shares’ excellent AI-driven year-to-date performance (up by 44%), Bracelin “continues to like this AI All-Star” and reiterates an Overweight (i.e., Buy) rating and $400 price target. There’s potential upside of 16% from current levels. (To watch Bracelin’s track record, click here)Overall, 35 analysts have chimed in with MSFT reviews over the past 3 months, and these breakdown into 31 Buys, 3 Holds and 1 Sell, providing the stock with a Strong Buy consensus rating.

The major banks came out and posted solid results, kicking off the period positively.And in the coming weeks, investors will have plenty of quarterly prints to sort through daily.However, next week’s results will be significant as mega-cap technology begins unveiling their results. We’ve got Meta Platforms META, Microsoft MSFT, and Alphabet GOOGL all set to report.The technology sector has been the best place to park cash in 2023, a welcomed development after a forgettable 2022.As of Wednesday, July 19th, the technology sector’s earnings are expected to slip -4.5% in Q2 on flat revenues, which would follow the decline of -10.3% on -2.9% lower revenues in the preceding quarter (2023 Q1).As we can see below, the sector’s growth pace is expected to improve from next quarter onwards, expected to turn positive in the second half of the year.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchFor a detailed analysis of Q2 earnings, I invite you to view our weekly Earnings Trends report -&gt;  Q2 Earnings Season Gets Off to a Positive Start.But how do top and bottom-line estimates stack up for the mega-cap technology titans? Let’s take a closer look.MicrosoftEarnings estimates for Microsoft’s quarter to be reported have primarily remained stable, with the $2.55 per share estimate down marginally over the last several months. The tech titan is forecasted to post solid growth, with the quarterly estimate reflecting a 15% year-over-year improvement in earnings.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchRevenue expectations have also primarily remained stable, with the $55.4 billion quarterly estimate up a fractional 0.2% since the end of April and suggesting an improvement of 6.7% from the year-ago period. MSFT’s revenue has remained on a healthy trend, as we can see in the chart below.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchUndoubtedly a major positive, the tech titan recently unveiled its pricing for its Microsoft 365 Copilot, priced at $30 a month. It’s reasonable to assume that analysts could begin taking their earnings expectations higher amid the favorable development, but no revisions have hit the tape yet.Story continuesMeta PlatformsAnalysts have remained optimistic for META’s quarter, with the $2.87 per share estimate up nearly 5% since the end of April and implying an improvement of 17% year-over-year. META delivered a big beat in its latest release, exceeding the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate by nearly 35%.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchIn addition, META’s revenue outlook has seen improvement, with the $30.9 billion quarterly revenue estimate up 2% since April and implying growth of 7% from the same period last year.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchMETA shares aren’t as rich as other mega-cap tech stocks, with the current 25.2X forward earnings multiple sitting modestly above the 23.1X five-year median. Given the company’s forecasted growth, shares look highly attractive from a valuation perspective.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchAlphabet Similar to MSFT, analysts have hardly moved their earnings expectations for the quarter to be reported, with the $1.32 per share estimate down a marginal 0.8% over the last several months. The Google parent continues to grow, with the estimate reflecting 9% higher earnings.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchAlphabet is expected to bring in $60.3 billion in sales, 5% higher than the year-ago period. Analysts haven’t had much to say regarding the top line, with the quarterly estimate up a tiny 0.1% since April.And similar to META, Alphabet shares aren’t expensive on a relative basis, with the current 22.1X forward earnings multiple sitting nicely beneath the 25.2X five-year median. The stock carries a Value Style Score of C.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchBottom LineThe real fun begins next week when mega-cap tech begins reporting.We’ve got several notable market heavyweights on the schedule, including Microsoft MSFT and Alphabet GOOGL, after the market’s close on Tuesday, July 25th.  Meta Platforms META will report on the following day, July 26th, after the market’s close.It’s reasonable to assume that some of the earnings positivity has already been priced into these companies’ shares, given their remarkable outperformance in 2023. In addition, we’ll likely see volatility tick higher amid the releases.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research? Today, you can download 7 Best Stocks for the Next 30 Days.

(AP) — Groundwater containing low levels of radioactive material may have reached the edge of the Mississippi River, the energy company responsible for the leak from its nuclear power plant in Monticello, Minnesota, announced on Thursday.Tritium, a radioactive isotope of hydrogen, has not been detected in the river water itself, Xcel Energy said in a statement.“The closest sample to detect tritium is about 30 feet from the river, and detected about 1,000 picocuries per liter, far below Safe Drinking Water Act standards, or below 20,000 picocuries per liter,"" the statement said. “Any presence of tritium in the river would be well below the Safe Drinking Water standard and likely at levels indistinguishable from what occurs naturally in the environment.”The Minnesota Pollution Control Agency and the state Department of Health released a joint statement saying the latest development does not present a threat to public health, and there are no immediate impacts to the safety of drinking water or private wells, Minnesota Public Radio reported.Xcel Energy discovered in November that about 400,000 gallons (1.5 million liters) of water containing tritium had leaked from a faulty pipe. The utility made a temporary fix but learned in March that hundreds more gallons of tritium-laced water leaked, leading to a dayslong shutdown to fix the pipe.While the utility and health officials say the leak is not dangerous, the issue has prompted concerns among residents and raised questions about aging pipelines.More than half of the tritium that leaked from the pipe has been recovered, officials said in May.The nuclear plant is about 40 miles (64 kilometers) northwest of Minneapolis.]"

XEL is scheduled to release second-quarter 2023 results on Jul 27, before market open. The company delivered an earnings surprise of 2.7% in the last reported quarter.Let’s discuss the factors that are likely to get reflected in the upcoming quarterly results.Factors to ConsiderXcel Energy’s second-quarter earnings are likely to have benefited from the new electric and natural gas rates that became effective during the quarter.  Similar to the first quarter, stable contribution from Electric Commercial &amp; Industrial customers is expected to have benefited second-quarter earnings.Improvements in productivity and efficiency, which are anticipated to lower operating and maintenance (O&amp;M) costs, are likely to have had a positive impact on XEL’s performance. Owing to such initiatives, our Zacks model predicts a 18.8% and 2.5% decline in O&amp;M and total operating expenses in the to-be-reported quarter.Q2 ExpectationsThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for Xcel Energy’s earnings is pegged at 61 cents per share, implying a year-over-year increase of 1.7%. The consensus mark for revenues is pinned at $3.45 billion, indicating a 0.8% improvement year over year.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for XEL’s total operating revenues for the Electric unit is pegged at $3,006 million, indicating growth of 2.8% from the year-ago quarter’s reported figure. The consensus estimate for Natural Gas residential customers is pegged at $408 million, which is 67.7% of total revenues. The unit contributed 54% in the year-ago quarter.Quantitative Model PredictsOur proven model does not conclusively predict an earnings beat for Xcel Energy this time around.

69,fb66f6c6-3701-3d58-b060-37b9a8248bd2,ADM,2023-07-22,15 Most Consumed Crops in the World,Insider Monkey,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/15-most-consumed-crops-world-150822097.html,1689952102,STORY,"['ADM', 'ANDE', 'BG']","[In this extensive article, we will shed light on the most consumed crops in the world and the percentage they have in the global food supply chain. To understand their primary diets, we will also discuss crop consumption trends in Asia, the Americas, and Africa. If you want to skip the details, read 5 Most Consumed Crops in the World. According to the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), sugarcane, maize, rice, and wheat are the most consumed crops in the world. As of the 2021/2022 crop year, maize was the highest-yielding staple crop, with over 1.4 billion metric tons of production worldwide. Corn is largely consumed in regions with high livestock production due to its extensive use in animal feed. Likewise, rice and wheat are primary grains in human diet, especially in Asia and North Africa, respectively. In the previous crop year, rice production reached 1 billion metric tons collectively produced in 145 countries, with China and India collectively accounting for more than half of the global rice output. Wheat accounted for 907 million metric tons, with the European Union, China, and India being the top producers. These staple crops contribute significantly to nutritional needs and have extensive economic implications. For instance, the major cash crops, i.e., wheat, rice, and maize, are the pillars of global food security as they make up staple food for over 5 billion people. The dominance of these three crops also hints at their role in global food systems as the necessity for sustainable practices to feed growing populations rises. Cooking bananas (also called plantains) and ripe bananas both are widely consumed across the world. If you want to know the key players in the market, read 15 Biggest Banana Producers in the World. Go bananas!Impact of Crops on Food Security According to the Agricultural Production Statistics Report of UN FAO, primary crops saw a production surge of 52 percent between 2000 and 2020 worldwide and reached a collective yield of 9.3 billion tonnes in 2020. If we break this yield increase into groups, cereals amounted to 32% of the total crop yield in 2022, closely followed by sugar crops (23%) and vegetable and oil crops (12%). Story continuesWorld Food Agriculture Statistical Yearbook 2022 says that almost 10 percent of the population suffered from hunger in 2021. This percentage was 9.3 percent in 2020 and 8 percent in 2019, a change attributable to population growth and rising inflation. The food insecurity situation is the worst in Africa as the continent's PoU (prevalence of undernourishment) rose from 19.4% in 2021 to 19.7% in 2022. The World's Food Consumption Trends The world's average dietary energy supply (calories a person consumes every day) trends present an intriguing picture where we can make sense of why certain parts of the world are struggling with increasing obesity. According to the FAO Statistical Yearbook 2022, the world's average DES (dietary energy supply) is 2,960 kcal per person. This consumption is projected to reach 3,139 kcal by 2050, up from an average of 2,789 in 2000. The DES is currently the highest in North America and Europe, where an average person consumes 3,540 kcal per day, most of which comes from carbs. Moreover, Asia has seen the highest increase in dietary energy supply, which has gone up 14% in the last two decades in the region. Companies Making it Big in the Crop SectorArcher-Daniels-Midland (NYSE:ADM), headquartered in Chicago, is one of the largest milling companies in the US that has 22 mills across the country. Archer-Daniels-Midland (NYSE:ADM) processes corn, wheat, sorghum, and linseed, among other major crops. Besides staple crops, Archer-Daniels-Midland (NYSE:ADM) produces cocoa and corn-based products to feed animals. Interestingly, the company also holds the record of producing bread loaves from freshly harvested wheat in under 13 minutes.Here's what ADM's management said during the latest earnings call conference:""We are confident that ADM will be able to deliver on our plans for 2023 despite some pockets of soft demand. Supply and demand shifts are allowing ADM to flex our integrated value chain in support of another strong year of results. We continue to advance partnership agreements with major players across multiple industries, from regenerative agriculture to alternative proteins, to sustainable fuels, to plant-based industrial and personal care products. All of these partnerships are supporting ADM as we evolve at pace with the external environment to capture new growth opportunities.""Plus, Bunge Limited (NYSE:BG) is a substantial international soybean exporter that also works in grain trading, food processing, and fertilizer manufacturing. Bunge Limited (NYSE:BG) supplies quality ingredients like milled products, lecithins, fats, and oils to food manufacturers across 40 countries. Bunge Limited (NYSE:BG) also has a 'sustainable sourcing' agenda which involves closely working with NGOs, farmers, and other crop market stakeholders to make farming sustainable. The company's business objectives, like supporting humanitarian causes, align well with United Nations' Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).Likewise, The Andersons Inc. (NASDAQ:ANDE) is a major company doing business in commodity merchandising, plant nutrients, and renewable resources. The Andersons Inc. (NASDAQ:ANDE) has terminals across North America that buy and sell corn, soybean, and wheat, among other commodities. The Andersons Inc. (NASDAQ:ANDE) currently has 72 facilities in the US, UK, Switzerland, and Canada, owing to its 180 million bushel grain storage capacity. 15 Most Consumed Crops in the World15 Most Consumed Crops In The WorldOur Methodology We ranked the most widely consumed grains in the world based on the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization (UN FAO). However, owing to the lack of credible data on the world's crop consumption trends, we used top crops' production data as a proxy for their consumption based on the assumption of supply and demand. After shortlisting the 15 most consumed crops in the world, we did individual searches in the UN FAO database to find the said crop's production quantity for all countries collectively. Based on the sum of a crop's production, we slightly rounded the figures to present their consumption in million tons. Based on our research, here are the 15 most consumed crops in the world: 15. Pearl MilletGlobal Consumption in 2021/2022 Crop Year: 32.7 million tons Millet is a nutrient-rich grain and is a staple food source, mainly in Africa and Asia. The crop is highly consumed in India, Nigeria, and Niger, where its drought-resistant properties make it an ideal crop. Western markets have also begun embracing millet due to its gluten-free nature and high nutritional profile. As global attention towards healthier and sustainable food choices increases, millet consumption is expected to rise, and the crop's global market is projected to reach $18.3 billion by 2030 (up from $10.1 billion in 2020).14. Plantains Global Consumption in 2021/2022 Crop Year: 45.3 million tons Plantains, a type of banana with a different taste, are prevalent in Latin American, Caribbean, and West African diets. These starchy fruits are usually consumed cooked and are lauded for their nutritional value. The crop provides sustenance as it can be used in fried or baked snacks like tostones and staple dishes such as mofongo or fufu, among others. Plantains' popularity has surged in North America and Europe, sparking a rising trend in the crop's worldwide consumption.13. Sorghum Global Consumption in 2021/2022 Crop Year: 64.36 million tons Sorghum is loved in Africa, Asia, and Central America, with Africa alone accounting for around 60% of its global consumption. As a grain, the crop's grains are ground into flour and used in dishes like porridge, flatbreads, and beverages. Sorghum flour has found a significant role in the global gluten-free market, appealing to those with dietary restrictions. Interestingly, the crop's usage extends beyond food, as it also contributes to biofuel production because its sugar content can be fermented to make ethanol, and the stalk and seeds are directly used for biomass energy production.  12. Yams Global Consumption in 2021/2022 Crop Year: 75.1 million tons Yams are staple root vegetables in many global cuisines in Africa. The crop's primary consumer is Nigeria, which accounts for over 60% of the world's yam production and consumes most of it. Most frequently, yams are boiled, roasted, or fried and served alongside meat or fish dishes. Yams are also processed into dried flour in some regions, which furthers their culinary versatility. 11. Onions Global Consumption in 2021/2022 Crop Year: 130 million tons Onions enhance dishes with their distinctive flavor and provide substantial health benefits like maintaining blood sugar levels. They are primarily consumed in Asia, especially in India, which consumes over 15 million tons annually. According to the National Onion Association, the average annual onion consumption is 13.67 pounds per person worldwide. In terms of per capita onion consumption, Libya tops the list with 66.8 pounds per head usage. Moreover, China, Pakistan, and the US also demonstrate high levels of onion consumption. In terms of preparation, onions are typically used as base ingredients, cooked in various dishes, including stews, stir-fries, and soups.10. Sweet Potatoes Global Consumption in 2021/2022 Crop Year: 136 million tons China leads in sweet potato consumption, consuming over 80% of the worldwide yield. Africa, too, embraces sweet potatoes, particularly in Uganda and Nigeria. The crop's high consumption relates to its adaptive nature and nutritional benefits, offering abundant vitamins A and C, fiber, and potassium. In Asia, sweet potatoes are often steamed or stir-fried, while African cuisines commonly boil them. Meanwhile, in North America and Europe, they're baked, roasted, or pureed into soups, emphasizing their natural sweetness. 9. Bananas Global Consumption in 2021/2022 Crop Year: 137 million tons Bananas hold a vital role in East African and South Asian diets, where consumption per capita is the highest. In Uganda, for instance, it's estimated that the average person consumes over 200 kgs of bananas per year. While mostly consumed as a fruit, bananas are also used as a staple food in Uganda and the Philippines, where they are consumed in forms like matoke and banana cue, respectively. 8. Barley Global Consumption in 2021/2022 Crop Year: 147 million tons Barley is one of the most consumed crops in the world. Around 147 million tons of barley were consumed worldwide in the crop year 2021/2022. The crop finds particular prevalence in Europe, North America, and parts of Asia. Barley is used in the production of bread, animal feed, and alcoholic beverages, such as beer and whisky. Barley's consumption pattern reflects cultural norms and culinary traditions. Europe, especially Germany, and Belgium, leads in barley use as they are among the Top 15 Beer Drinking Countries In The World. In Asia, particularly Tibet, barley is a dietary staple where it is transformed into tsampa, a traditional roasted barley flour dish. 7. Tomatoes Global Consumption in 2021/2022 Crop Year: 256 million tons Tomatoes are rich in vitamin C and lycopene, and China, India, and the United States top the list of its largest consumers. The culinary versatility of tomatoes allows them to be a staple in various diets, be it raw in salads, cooked in curries or stews, or processed into products like ketchup, tomato sauce, or juice. Mediterranean countries, in particular, have a high consumption rate due to the prominent role tomatoes play in their traditional dishes like pasta and pizza.6. Cassava Global Consumption in 2021/2022 Crop Year: 319 million tons Cassava is a root crop native to South America and has become a staple food for nearly a billion people, most of whom live in sub-Saharan Africa, Southeast Asia, and Latin America. The crop is consumed in various forms, often depending on local preferences and traditions. In Africa, it's processed into a granulated product called gari, while in South America, cassava is used for making flatbreads when its root is ground into flour.Click to continue reading 5 Most Consumed Crops in the World. Suggested Articles:Top 20 Rice Producing Countries In The World20 Countries with Highest Rice Consumption Per Capita15 Countries That Produce the Most CornDisclosure: None. 15 Most Consumed Crops In The World is originally published at Insider Monkey.]"

(NYSE:PM) released a stellar second-quarter earnings report on Thursday, which led to a surge in its stock price. The world's largest tobacco company beat its revenue target by $290 million and trumped its earnings per share estimate by 12 cents, suggesting that market analysts underappreciated its resilience against a shaky economy.Warning! GuruFocus has detected 4 Warning Sign with PM. Click here to check it out. PM 15-Year Financial DataThe intrinsic value of PMPeter Lynch Chart of PMWith the tobacco giant's second-quarter earnings report in arrears, the questions beckons: Will the company sustain its robust results, and how will it impact its stock price? Let's delve into a deeper discussion about Philip Morris International's latest endeavors to find out.Understanding the earnings reportPhilip Morris reported significant momentum from key segments during its second quarter. First, the company's broad-based shipments increased by 3.3% year over year, while its revenue per unit increased by 7.7%, illustrating a secular sales pattern instead of cyclical demand.As anticipated, the company's heated tobacco products gained additional traction. The segment's shipment volumes surged by 26.65 year over year, concurrently playing a pivotal part in Philip Morris' transition toward a non-combustible business model. In fact, the segment's latest results mean its shipment volume now spans approximately 16.4% of the company's total demand.Progress with smoke-free productsFurther, Philip Morris' progress with smoke-free products is overlooked. The segment comprises approximately 35% of the company's revenue mix and is exposed to an industry with a compound annual growth rate potential of 14.6% until 2033.Philip Morris Offers Value Following Earnings BeatSource: Future Market InsightsRole of combustible productsAlthough Philip Morris' newer products have recently drawn much attention from investors, its combustible products should not be overlooked. In fact, its Marlboro brand has received three price hikes in the U.S. during the past six months, illustrating why the combustibles division has a 23.9% market share. Moreover, combustible sales diversify the company's target market, lending it the opportunity for cross-sales and lower income statement variance.Story continuesOperating margins and profitabilityPhilip Morris' operating margin remains robust despite rising input costs around the globe. The company's gross profit margin of 64.2% is accommodated by a cyclical average net profit margin of 26.41%, illustrating the quantity of residual value being passed through to its shareholders.Key operating metricsIn my view, the salient features of a business' efficiency can be measured by three ratios, namely the cash conversion cycle, asset turnover ratio and the inventory turnover ratio. Philip Morris' cash conversion cycle is trending downward, suggesting the time between buying and converting inventory into cash is receding. The introduction of artificial intelligence-driven supply chain solutions might proliferate this metric even further in the coming years, resulting in an improved income statement.Philip Morris Offers Value Following Earnings BeatThe asset turnover ratio is another operating metric that provides substantial insight into a company's operations. Philip Morris' asset turnover ratio presents a few worries, as its downtrend suggests receding monetization of its asset base. Much of this might be due to excess acquisitions, often resulting in goodwill that cannot be monetized. Additionally, Philip Morris' non-combustible products segment possesses intangible work-in-progress assets.Although a risk, I believe the company's receding asset turnover ratio can be justified. Finally, its inventory turnover ratio is trending upward. As mentioned earlier, the company's profit margins are robust, suggesting it does not suffer from a poor cost structure. As such, the ratio's uptrend is likely due to lower inventory stockpiles, implying efficient inventory management.Valuation and dividend prospectsMy choice of valuation method includes a forward-looking approach that utilizes Philip Morris' earnings per share guidance and a relative comparison of its stock's past price-earnings ratios. Philip Morris International's expected earnings for 2023 is between $6.13 to $6.22 per share. If the Friday pre-market stock price of $98.18 is divided by the midpoint EPS figure, a forward price-earnings ratio of 15.88 is conceived.A price-earnings ratio of 15.88 is below Philip Morris' cyclical averaged ratio of 17.01, suggesting that its stock has value in store.The second component of its expected return is its dividendthe company's five-year average dividend yield on cost of 6.1% illustrates the risk-return benefits its stock presents as it aligns with the ""bird in hand"" theory, which says that investors assign lower risk to income-generating assets.Potential risksPhilip Morris' identifiable risks are relatively straightforward.First, the company is in the midst of a transition to satisfy a new consumer base, which presents costly restructuring charges. Further, its combustible products segment faces elevated environmental, social and governance risk premiums, potentially assigning a lower terminal value to the business.ConclusionPhilip Morris' second-quarter earnings release has again shown why its stock presents compelling total return prospects.The company's non-combustible products segment is garnering momentum, while its combustible division continues to enhance its market share. Further, Philip Morris' efficiency metrics are well aligned and its valuation multiples, coupled with its dividend profile, suggest there is value in store.This article first appeared on GuruFocus.]"

And now please turn to Page 3.Today, we will discuss our results primarily on an adjusted non-GAAP and continuing operations basis. For the second quarter, the difference between our GAAP results and adjusted results consists of the following items: amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets and the financial impacts associated with our minority investment in Indicor. Reconciliations can be found in our press release and in the appendix of this presentation on our website. And now if you please turn to Page 4, I will hand the call over to Neil. After our prepared remarks, we will take questions from our telephone participants. Neil?Story continuesLaurence Neil HunnThanks, Zack, and thanks to everyone for joining our call. We're looking forward to sharing our second quarter results with you this morning, which like Q1 were quite good.As we turn to Page 4, let's look at today's agenda. I'll start with our second quarter enterprise highlights and then ask Jason to share our financial results. After that, we'll turn to our segment-specific discussion and wrap up outlining our increased 2023 enterprise guidance. So let's go ahead and get started. Next slide, please. As we turn to Page 5, the 4 main takeaways for today's call are, first; we continue to perform extremely well and had a very strong second quarter, another demonstration of the quality of our portfolio of businesses; second, we're increasing our full year guidance, both in terms of total and organic revenue growth and adjusted debt; third, generative AI, we're very excited by the promise of this technology and outline reasons why today; and fourth, we remain very well positioned for disciplined capital deployment. As it relates to the first takeaway, a strong start to the year and a solid second quarter, we saw total revenue grow 17% and organic revenue grew 9%. Consistent with our long-standing strategy, we continue to not only scale our enterprise, but also simultaneously improve its underlying quality and recurring revenue base. Importantly, we had very strong cash flow performance with free cash flow growing 17% in the quarter. Our results this quarter are another proof point that our higher quality, less cyclical portfolio was purpose-built to consistently perform at a very high level. Given the strong second quarter, we're increasing our full year total revenue growth to be around 13%, increasing our organic revenue growth to be around 7% and increasing our full year debt guidance to be in the range of $16.36 to $16.50 or up $0.23 at the midpoint versus our previous guidance of $16.10 to $16.30. Third, relative to GenAI, we feel we're structurally advantaged and excited by this technology as our vertical and application-specific businesses will use our specialized market positions and knowledge to provide context for these enabling technologies, both to create customer value and internal productivity gains, more on this during today's call.And finally, we continue to be well positioned relevant to capital deployment. We remain active in the market as we evaluate an actively diligence many high-quality opportunities. Jason, I'll turn the call over to you so you can walk through our second quarter results and our very strong financial position. Jason?Jason P. ConleyThanks, Neil, and I hope everyone is doing well this morning. Turning to Slide 6. The second quarter was another good post in 2023. Revenue came in at $1.53 billion, which was up 17% over prior year. Organic growth was 9% which was led by 8% software recurring revenue growth across the enterprise and outsized growth 19% in our tech-enabled products segment. EBITDA increased 20% to $617 million with EBITDA operating leverage of 46%. Notably, margin expanded across all 3 segments in the quarter. Debts of $4.12 was $0.12 above the high end of our guidance range and 20% above prior year. Debt growth was in line with EBITDA growth given the offsetting impact of a higher tax rate and lower net interest expense. Moving to free cash flow. As a reminder, the second quarter is always our lowest conversion quarter in the year as we make 2 federal tax payments. We delivered $295 million of free cash flow in the quarter, which was up 17% over prior year. As I've previously mentioned, Frontline's cash flow is seasonally weighted to Q3 and Q4, especially in Q3, and this is in line with our K-12 customers' annual renewals. So we expect a meaningful increase to cash flow in the second half. Taking a broader view of cash flow on the slide, recall that we acquired Vertafore in 2020 and had a onetime cash tax benefit of $120 million, of which about $60 million benefited the second quarter of 2021. We, therefore, had very strong multiyear cash flow performance when normalizing for this 2021 tax item. For the year, we are confident that free cash flow will be greater than 30% of revenue. Turning to our balance sheet on Slide 7. Our net leverage sits at 2.2x at the end of the quarter with about $6.7 billion of debt and just under $1.5 billion of cash against our TTM EBITDA of $2.35 billion. Also, our $3.5 billion revolver remains fully undrawn. To summarize, we have significant acquisition capacity and remain quite active in many bespoke processes. To that end, in Q3, we expect to close on Replicon, which is a bolt-on acquisition for our Deltek business, with a purchase price of $450 million or about $370 million net of a long-term cash tax benefit. Neil will discuss the details around this exciting addition to the Deltek platform and the segment discussion. So with that, I'll turn it back over to Neil to talk about our segment performance and outlook. Neil?Laurence Neil HunnThanks, Jason. Let's turn to Page 9 and walk through our Q2 highlights for our Application Software segment. Revenues here were $770 million, up 6% on an organic basis, and EBITDA margins increased to 43.7% in the quarter. In this segment, we continue to see consistently strong performance across the entire group of companies. We'll start with Deltek. Deltek was once again solid across both our government contracting and private sector businesses. Importantly, Deltek continues to see momentum build with our SaaS offerings and retention rates remain at historically high levels.Also in the quarter, and as Jason mentioned earlier, we announced the acquisition of Replicon for Deltek, Roper's largest bolt-on today. Replicon is a market-leading timekeeping and workforce management SaaS solution focused on professional services firms and is highly complementary to Deltek's strategy. We expect Replicon to contribute north of $70 million of revenue and $24 million of EBITDA next year, and we expect the deal to close during the third quarter. Finally, as it relates to Deltek, we wanted to brag on them for a moment. During the quarter, the Washington Post awarded Deltek the #4 top workplace in the D.C. Metro area for large companies. As you know, we have a closely held belief that talent and culture can create long-term competitive advantage, and this is certainly the case for Deltek. During Roper's ownership Deltek, the company has increased its organic growth rate, retention levels, recurring revenue and margin structure and a big contributor to that success is the structural talent advantage that Deltek continues to build. Congrats to Mike, and congrats to your entire team.Aderant, our software business focused on the needs of law firms, continues to be excellent. In the quarter, Aderant sold record bookings and continued success in the adoption and cross-sell of their SaaS solutions. Also and importantly, during the quarter, Aderant launched their generative AI enabler, MADDI. Today, MADDI is enabling 2 solutions outside council guidelines, management and time entry with plans to extend this to AR cash-receipt matching and docketing over the coming months. Over time, MADDI will be integrated widely across Aderant's product platforms. Generative AI for the legal space has tremendous potential. One such example in the market today is Onyx. Onyx powered by MADDI solves a massive challenge that all law firms face, namely how to navigate outside counsel guidelines or the biller requirements that clients impose on their law firms.It's fairly common for a large law firm to have to navigate hundreds of thousands of bespoke client billing requirements. Today, Onyx uses gender of AI to extract contractual terms and convert them into business tools used in the time entry and billing processes, a true game changer.More broadly across Roper, we're excited about the potential of Generative AI and large language models. We believe, given our deeply verticalized and application-specific business model, that our businesses are structurally advantaged given that all AI, computational and generative, need context, specifically data and workflows in which to train or target the technology. Internally, we're working closely with our businesses on the productivity and product-enabled opportunities associated with GenAI. Certainly, much more to come on this. Now back to the segment performance in Vertafore, our software business that tech enables property and casualty insurance agencies. Vertafore continues to be a great asset for us with solid performance across our core P&amp;C business and the recent MGA solutions bolt-on. Our healthcare IT businesses also performed very well in the quarter with growth in each of our healthcare IT franchises; Clinisys, Data Innovations and Strata. Frontline also continues to deliver for us. Frontline's mission is to empower the front line of education. As many of you know, the hiring of teachers and administrative staff is particularly challenging, and Frontline software solutions better equip K-12 school districts to navigate these challenges. Because of this, Frontline solutions are mission-critical and of high importance to their school district customers. As such, Frontline's net retention is consistently strong. Looking to the second half of the year, we expect to see organic revenue growth to be in the mid-single-digit area for the segment. Overall, very strong results and outlook for this segment.Turning to Page 10. Revenues in the quarter for our Network Software segment were $358 million, up 5% on an organic basis, and EBITDA margins were strong at 54.2%. As with our Application Software segment, growth and performance was solid across the segment. Relative to business-specific comments, we'll start with U.S. and Canadian freight matching businesses, DAT and Loadlink, both of which grew in the quarter despite continued challenges across the broader freight and logistics markets. I'll remind you that our businesses are critical to the operation and execution of the North American spot freight market.In addition and importantly, the spot market is a long-term secular beneficiary in terms of the volume of future freight shipments. Throughout and across the freight and economic cycle, DAT and Loadlink continue to innovate and launch new products and offerings to help drive enhanced customer value and share of wallet.As we speak, DAT is launching a Generative AI-enabled solution among other initiatives targeted to combat trade industry fraud. This is in addition to their existing set of Computational AI and data science-driven solutions like DATIQ, which they deployed at scale over the last 3 or 4 years.By pipeline, our network software business that tech enables the distribution channel for life insurance and annuities, had very nice ARR gains in the quarter, driven by strong retention and customer expansion activity. Foundry continued its string of strong performance and had terrific growth for their flagship product, Nuke, which enabled continued double-digit recurring revenue growth. As we mentioned last quarter, Foundry commenced their subscription pricing transition for Nuke, and in the first half of the year had north of 60% of their Nuke units sold under their new model ahead of their transition plan. Finally, our alternate site healthcare businesses, led by SoftWriters and SHP were strong in the quarter. Execution was solid, and the business has benefited by an improving census in skilled nursing assisted living facilities and home health reaching the highest occupancy levels in patient volumes since the onset of the pandemic.Turning to the second half of the year, we expect to see mid-single-digit organic growth for this segment based on sustained ARR momentum. As we turn to Page 11, revenues in the quarter for our tech-enabled products segment were $403 million, up 19% on an organic basis. EBITDA margins for this segment were strong at 36.4% for the quarter. Across the segment, business performance and execution was exceptional. Importantly, the broad-based supply chain issues continue to ease. Neptune, our water meter and technology products business continues to be great. In the quarter, they had a record revenue performance. Importantly, Neptune continues to see increasing demand and momentum for the residential and commercial ultrasonic or static meters. We remain bullish about Neptune in the market in which they compete. Given this market tends to be quite steady as Neptune's customers' budgets are typically fixed year-to-year and not tied to broader macroeconomic trends or cycles.Verathon was awesome in the quarter as well, with double-digit order growth and tremendous operational execution. Specifically, Verathon saw strength across the reoccurring single-use products, both bronchoscope or BFlex, and video innovation or GlideScope as well as BladderScan capital purchases. Northern Digital or NDI was also strong in the quarter, setting a record revenue for the business. A group of smaller businesses here, IPA, rf IDEAS and Inovonics were fantastic in the quarter as they substantially work through a series of nagging supply chain challenges. Relative to the second half of the year, we expect to see high single-digit organic revenue growth. Recall, we have a tough Q3 revenue and margin comp to lap from the prior year. Now please turn to Page 13, and let's review our increased 2023 guidance. Based on our strong second quarter performance, we're raising our full year 2023 guidance for total revenue, organic revenue and adjusted debts. For 2023, we now expect total revenue growth to be around 13%, an increase from 12% plus last quarter. In addition, we're raising our full year organic revenue outlook to be in the 7% (inaudible), an increase from 6% to 7% last quarter and 5% to 6% in our original guide.As a result of our improved revenue outlook, we're increasing our debt guidance to be in the range of $16.36 to $16.50, up from our prior guidance of $16.10 to $16.30. Assumed in this guidance is a tax rate trending to the high end of our 21% to 22% range. Specific to the third quarter, we're establishing our debt guidance to be in the range of $4.16 and $4.20. Now please turn over to Page 14, and then we'll look forward to answering your questions. We want to leave you with the same 4 points with which we started. First, the year started strong and we delivered solid second quarter results. In the quarter, we saw revenues increase 17% to $1.53 billion. This growth was underpinned with 9% organic revenue growth and 8% organic software recurring revenue growth. In addition, EBITDA margins were quite strong at 40.3%.Second, based on the strong second quarter performance, the recurring nature of our revenue stream and the importance of our solutions to our customers, we're increasing our full year total and organic revenue growth outlook and increasing our full year debt outlook to be between $16.36 and $16.50.Third, we're excited by the potential of Generative AI, both as it relates to internal productivity and using our application specificity to provide context for new product development ideas. We look forward to sharing progress and updates in coming quarters and years.And finally, we continue to be active with our capital deployment activities as we have north of $4 billion of available M&amp;A firepower. As we've been discussing over the past several months, we have a very large pipeline of opportunities, though, as always, we remain super patient and highly disciplined to ensure the continued optimal deployment of our available capital.Now as we turn to your questions and if you flip to the final slide or strategic flywheel, we want to once again thank those of you who joined us in New York for our first ever Investor Day and for the hundreds who have watched the replay over the past few months. During that long-form overview of Roper, we were excited to share with you our long-term strategy, the high-quality nature of our portfolio of businesses, our operating ability to improve our businesses, our process-driven capital deployment approach and our compelling long-term business model that compounds cash flow in the mid-teens area. So thank you for your continued interest in Roper, and with that, let's open it up to your questions.Question and Answer SessionOperator(Operator Instructions) And the first question comes from Julian Mitchell with Barclays.Julian C.H. MitchellMaybe just the first question around in network software. You had a very strong margin performance up over 200 points of only mid-single-digit organic growth. So I just wondered if there was anything driving that perhaps on mix or anything kind of onetime. And then also in that division, how are you thinking about second half growth in DAT and Loadlink versus first half?Jason P. ConleyIt's Jason. So yes, I mean, I think we had a strong performance across a lot of the businesses. I think the -- probably the one standout is our ConstructConnect business. We acquired a bolt-on that we closed last year. And we're seeing -- realizing the benefits from that deal. And then like I said, beyond that, it's just across the segment.Laurence Neil HunnAnd relative to your second question, second half for DAT and Loadlink, our Freight Match businesses, we continue to be cautious there and conservative. We've been -- held that posture the whole year. DAT performed very well in the quarter and it grew high single digits. The broker part of the business and the data analytics part of the business remains super solid, high retention rates. But as we all know, the carrier side of the market, the excess carriers are trading out of the market, and that has a weighing effect on DAT. So we've modeled that in all year long and it's playing out generally in line with what we thought here in Sarasota, maybe a touch better, but we'll just say in line with Sarasota's expectations. And relative to the second half for DAT, the big wildcard is what happens with (inaudible). I mean -- so we'll see what happens there, could be a pickup for the spot market if something were to turn negative on either one or both of those.Julian C.H. MitchellThat's interesting. And then just as we look at the second half guidance, you called out even TEP the tough comp for third quarter. Just one other thing I wanted to check on the back half, it looks like the guidance implies fourth quarter debt doesn't really go up much sequentially in Q4. Historically, you've had often a mid-single-digit type increase in Q4 sequentially. I just wondered if that was just kind of conservatism in the construct for this year or if there's anything specific going on?Laurence Neil HunnNothing really specific sequentially. I mean I think we've talked about a little bit about just the seasonal shutdown at Neptune. We've had that historically. But I wouldn't point to any conservatism. I mean, we've got sort of networks still at mid-single digits. So maybe in the prior years, you might have seen some acceleration coming into the fourth quarter, but nothing really unusual there. And what was your first question? Sorry, Julian?Julian C.H. MitchellOh, no. That was really just around if there was anything on the fourth quarter to kind of call out. But it doesn't -- it sounds like this year should be fairly typical in terms of seasonality.Laurence Neil HunnCorrect.OperatorAnd the next question comes from Deane Dray of RBC Capital Markets.Deane Michael DrayCan we start with just broadly, the tone of business. There was a reference in the first quarter and I think also at the Analyst Day that you were seeing some slower customer decision-making. But the way I look at this quarter with the upside on the organic side and the outlook, has that improved? And very specifically, would you measure that in new logos and SaaS conversions, but just kind of that tone of business, please?Laurence Neil HunnYes. I would characterize it. Our software businesses are playing out about as we expected coming into the year, right? Expecting a little bit of a slowdown. So you see delayed decision-making that has -- that pushes out net new sales, but it also has the impact of having higher gross retention because decisions are being deferred. .And then also just the amount of expansion activities that we have. Activity we have with our customers is a little bit less as our customers are just more cautious as they look forward. So that's playing out about as we expected. It's not acute in any one of our businesses. It's just sprinkled across the universe of our portfolio. Relative to TEP, I mean it was just fantastic. We had a lot of demand in the medical businesses, remains very strong, especially at Verathon and CIVCO. A lot of supply chain clear up in the first half, especially in the second quarter. And we called out very rarely, do we call out the 3 small businesses that we did on the slide, but they had just terrific supply chain sort of performance and operational performance in the quarter.Deane Michael DrayYes. That's really good to hear. And just as a follow-up, can we talk about the impact AI is having and how you're evaluating M&amp;A candidates. So is there an eye towards the barriers to entry. Roper is focused on these deep domain expertise types of deep vertical. So how do you look at where and how AI might be a threat to these? How do you look at the candidates in terms of where and how AI might advance their business model and just what has changed there?Laurence Neil HunnYes. I think it's certainly a consideration today. We're -- computationally, AI has been a consideration for a few years. Generative is newer this year. I think the thing that is nice about our portfolio or M&amp;A strategy is it just happens to play into the strength of where Generative AI and Computational AI is best suited. So more verticalized, more application-specific, more intimacy with customers. And so, our M&amp;A approach is well suited given the development of these technologies. And as always, you've heard us say this for decades, we're looking in our capital deployment. If there's a zero in the Monte Carlo, we can envision a doomsday, then we're out. We're just not going to lean into that. So we'll look at -- we always look at that. And to the extent we can dream up as zero in the Monte Carlo because of Generative Computational AI, then we're not going to consider it in any way. So that's not a new thing for us. Anything to add, Jason?Jason P. ConleyNo, I think that's right. And any sort of content type business, we've always steered away from, and I think this just accentuates that with the advent of AI, Generative AI.OperatorAnd the next question comes from Joseph Vruwink, Robert W. Baird and Co.Joseph D. VruwinkIf I go back to last quarter, I think you referenced the Leadership Summit and the business unit presidents coming together. This quarter, there was an announcement about iPipeline and Vertafore partnering together on product. Is it may be possible to connect these 2 things together? So by doing more to share best practices across the operating divisions, can Roper actually uncover incremental product opportunities and maybe offering a broader suite when it comes to certain end markets that are jointly served today?Laurence Neil HunnYes. I think there's definitely and demonstrably benefits for getting our leaders together unequivocally. It's going to be more in sharing best practices, sharing leadership philosophy, sharing failures and what they learn from the failure. It's going to be more about how do you lead, how do you manage, how do you inspire teams for terrific performance. It's going to be less on connection with the product teams because most of our businesses are in independent and disconnected markets and swim lanes. So if there's something that makes sense, we'll certainly do it. If it doesn't make sense, we won't. The good news about this particular iPipeline and Vertafore is it happened organically between the businesses without any push from the center. So you know that's authentic and it's going to drive value for our customers.Joseph D. VruwinkOkay. That's helpful. Just on the topic of Generative AI. As you say, your businesses, they provide the context that the applications need. So growth retention, if anything, is biased higher in many aspects. How do you think about net retention and just participating in new avenues for growth. So with some of the early products discussed today, does that really strengthen the core? Or is there a separate monetization that can happen?Laurence Neil HunnNo, no. I think there's definitely monetization that could happen. It will happen over time. There's no silver bullet in the short run. We play the long game, build for long-term customer value relationships. But there's just massive amounts of value that can be created by doing things with both Computational on Generative AI. And our relationship with our customers are such that we're -- at least for the last 20 years, we're able to capture our fair share of the value that's created. So I don't know why that would be any different going forward. And then as we all know, there's a tremendous amount of value or productivity to capture inside the 4 walls of our businesses using Generative AI as well.OperatorAnd the next question comes from Allison Poliniak with Wells Fargo.Allison Ann Marie Poliniak-CusicI saw the announcement with IntelliTrans sort of stepping out and partnering with the product sensor business. Is that something that's just unique to IntelliTrans? Or is it something that you're doing to sort of leverage that sort of asset-light business that you have? Any thoughts there.Laurence Neil HunnNo, that's very, very bespoke to IntelliTrans. I mean there's not an enterprise-wide strategy to do anything like that nor would we -- if there was, we wouldn't push it down. It's anathetical to what Roper is about. So it's very bespoke to IntelliTrans. Gold star for asking IntelliTrans question, by the way.Allison Ann Marie Poliniak-CusicIt helps in also covering transports. So -- and then just on tech-enabled products, that business continues to outperform organically. You mentioned difficult comps in Q3. Is there any more color you can give us to the cadence between Q3 and Q4 to kind of reach that target? And what sort of drove that outperformance this quarter?Jason P. ConleyYes. So this is Jason. I think it's a pretty consistent cadence in terms of the quarters. What I would say is the outperformance in Q3 was really across the board. We had -- Neptune continues to execute really well in their backlog. Their daily sales are up over their plan.Healthcare is doing really well in terms of procedures. So just executing on a kind of book-and-ship basis there. And then our -- some of our product businesses had some backlog that finally got cleared. So that really drove the Q3. And then the second half, like I said, organic growth should be fairly consistent. It's just what we had last year. We had a lot of backlog clear in the third quarter that with very high-margin products. So that's sort of the comp issue that we're lapping in the third quarter.OperatorAnd the next question comes from Terry Tillman with Truist.Terrell Frederick TillmanWonderful. Happy Friday, Neil, Jason and Zack. Maybe the first question, it's almost technically 2 questions, but I'm going to call it 1.5 questions, is actually back on Deltek, one of your biggest businesses, if not biggest business, on the app software side. I'm just curious on the relative health and demand. Somebody earlier asked about macro, but how the government side is performing versus private sector side? And the second part of that first question is it seems like something with Replicon, and I think you said it's about $70 million. You could have some pretty good revenue synergy opportunities. And how do you think about that $70 million business kind of unleashing that product into that large Deltek installed base? And then I have a follow-up.Laurence Neil HunnSo we'll call that 2 questions, 30 degrees. But the Deltek demand, as we talked about in the prepared remarks, our performance was solid across both government contracting and private sector. We are encouraged by the pipeline build in the quarter for Q4 and early '24 in government contracting. There definitely was a little bit of a lull or an air pocket in government contracting relative to the debt ceiling. And so it was nice to see activity get back to normalize or maybe slightly better than normalized activities relative to early pipeline build. So that was encouraging to see. You've got to see how that plays out, for sure. Replicon, we really like this bolt-on. As we said, it's the largest bolt-on we've done at $450 million, $370 million net of the tax benefit. It's time entry without attachment to an ERP. So time only is a highly demanded solution in the PS world. It is not sold today in government contracting. And so we have not underwritten into a revenue synergy opportunity. That's not part of the $70 million or the $24 million that we talked about. But it is certainly the expectation over time is to get Deltek takes this product in other core market of government contracting.Terrell Frederick TillmanGot it. And thanks for being generous, yes, I guess this technically is the third question. Then on the idea of the M&amp;A pipeline and you talked about you're just kind of working through opportunities and bespoke situations, et cetera. But compared to like 90 days ago, would you suggest that there's more -- it's more actionable on the bolt-ons versus the potential platform deals. Just maybe a temperature gauge on the stack ranking of the 2 types.Laurence Neil HunnYes. So it's been an interesting 90 days. So we continue to be active. Our pipeline still skews more towards bolt-ons for sure. More broadly in the market over the last 90 days, we are encouraged by the fact that there are a couple of sizable deals private that did not happen because the buyer universe rejected the seller's expectation on value. And so we view that as -- and the deal ultimately did not consummate. So we view that as actually an encouraging sign around as an early indicator that valuations are going to pull in to being a more normalized with cost of capital. So we're encouraged by that. But still, our pipeline leans into the bolt-on opportunities.Jason P. ConleyYes, (inaudible) are down dramatically year-over-year. And so there's just a lot of assets that, at some point, need to go. And it's been 1.5 years now. So we think it's getting closer.OperatorAnd the next question comes from Christopher Glynn with Oppenheimer.Christopher D. GlynnI wanted to touch on Foundry. Curious if there's any risk of any followed or perturbations from labor strife risk? And also, if you could revisit the comments on the transition plan for that?Laurence Neil HunnSure. So Foundry, for those that aren't familiar with it, it's a business and media entertainment, that's used in post production for a process called compositing where you take a live action image and a computer-generated image and push them together in the single scene.So think Game of Thrones, pretty much ever scene in Game of Thrones was used as composite with Foundry software as is almost any high-end production or streaming series. So as it turns out, I think this is the first time since 1960, we've had both a writer's strike and an actor's strike concurrently. So the current production of content is ceased. There is still a very active pipeline of things in post, and so it has no impact currently on Foundry. The current expectation is the strikes will be resolved this year. And if that's the case, then there'll be very little impact Foundry next year as they'll be back in production and sort of catch up. If it extends beyond this year, then yes, Foundry will likely be negatively impacted to some extent next year. So that's just going to be a watch item for us.And your second question, Foundry this year commenced the transition to a subscription pricing model for their core product of Nuke. So this year, there are -- you can buy it either as a license or a subscription. As we mentioned, about 60% -- north of 60% of the Nuke. Units were sold on a subscription basis this year. So it's a nice transition ahead of our plan. ARR is growing double digits. And then beginning next year, it will be 100% subscription opportunity to buy in the license format. So going a little bit better than planned.OperatorAnd the next question comes from Steve Tusa with JPMorgan.Charles Stephen TusaSo just a couple of things. Can you just talk about what you expect for third quarter free cash? Maybe just talk about the deferred revenue drag you guys have had in the first half, what's driving that? And then just what are organic bookings year-over-year for the software businesses in the second quarter?Jason P. ConleyYes. So as we mentioned before, Frontline is a new dynamic, right, for Roper, where all of the renewals happen in the third quarter. So we're already tracking really strong just month to date, if you will, for the renewals there. And they actually consumed cash in the first half, just to give you a perspective on that. I mean also, I think we historically have very strong second half seasonality. So that, plus just some of the -- I think some of the timing of working capital in the second quarter points to a much better second half. First half, we usually -- we pay out incentives. We had -- this year, we had that legal settlement. So that points to sort of that seasonal change for this year. And so we're still on track to deliver north of 30% of free cash flow to revenue.And then you asked about the trends on. So if we kind of look at enterprise software bookings, and it was up sequentially a bit and up year-over-year. Not quite as strong as the first quarter, maybe like low singles in area, which is about in line with what we had. It's obviously embedded in sort of our slowdown for the second half for new activity.OperatorAnd the next question comes from Brent Thill with Jefferies.Unidentified AnalystThis is (inaudible), on for Brent. Maybe just on the AI theme. I appreciate some of the color that you guys gave. I was curious, is there some sort of AI Playbook that you guys are laying out for the portfolio of companies to be thinking through? Just curious how you're approaching that across the portfolio, and I appreciate some of those one-off case studies?Laurence Neil HunnYes. So Playbook, I would say, no; accelerated education across multiple fronts, yes. So what is it? What's (inaudible) possible? What are the risks? What are the IP ownership issues? What is -- how do you get productivity with -- in R&amp;D, how do you get marketing lead productivity, marketing content productivity, customer service productivity? We're doing a series of teach-ins and learnings that is highly subscribed by our businesses. And so that's how we're sort of accelerating the learning across the enterprise.Unidentified AnalystGot it. That's helpful. And then maybe I wanted to just ask about you guys often talk about the portfolio being mostly macro insulated. I think the macro hasn't been as bad as many have viewed. But as you guys kind of think through that, have there been any companies that as things have softened a little bit that maybe have stuck out and maybe were a little surprising where you thought, hey, maybe these were a little bit more macro immune than they've been showing up to be?Laurence Neil HunnLook, Jason, I think, to our surprise, no. I mean, obviously, the one that gets a lot of attention is our DAT business, which grew. It's just truly exceptional the last couple of years. And then this year, it's moderated, still growing. And we talked about that quite a bit last quarter.We -- so really nothing. I mean, Neptune is solid. As we said in the prepared remarks, their customers' budgets tend to be very fixed year-to-year and not tied to housing starts, which some people think is the case, but it generally is not. Jason, anything that surprises?Jason P. ConleyI don't think so.Laurence Neil HunnThere's really nothing surprising on the cyclical piece.Jason P. ConleyYes. I mean Shannon has pointed out, maybe there's a little bit around government contracting, as I mentioned earlier, on the debt ceiling. It's not a macro point per se, but that's not clear at Deltek.OperatorAnd the next question comes from Joe Ritchie with Goldman Sachs.Joseph Alfred RitchieSo maybe just to round out that free cash flow margin point, going forward now that the seasonality has maybe changed a little bit, should we think about them like the second quarter as being kind of like a free cash flow margin around 20% going forward as you kind of think about modeling that business?Jason P. ConleyI mean it's going to be lower. I'm not sure if I point to a specific margin for every year. But we do make 2 federal tax payments. So that obviously just drags on the second quarter. But so it's always going to be lower than the full year. So that's how I would model it.Joseph Alfred RitchieOkay. All right. Great. That's helpful. And then I guess, lastly, we talked a little bit about technology-enabled products and the growth this quarter, tougher comps going forward. I'm just curious, is there a way to potentially quantify the supply chain easing impact that occurred this quarter? And then is that going to continue? I guess is that part of the headwind then potentially as you kind of -- as you think about the second half of the year?Laurence Neil HunnThat might be hard. We might have to -- I mean mid-single-digit growth is normal for that segment. And then we got to parse how much might be strength at Verathon and CIVCO that might be a little bit recurring on top of that, but then the balance may be -- and then the balance would be the supply chain sort of pull and a release.OperatorAnd this concludes our question-and-answer session. I will now turn it back to Zack Moxcey for any closing remarks.Zack MoxceyThanks, everyone, for joining us today. We look forward to speaking with you during our next earnings call.OperatorThank you. The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.]"

Buy These 3 Dividend Stocks,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/worried-market-froth-buy-3-202700274.html,1689971220,STORY,"['ROP', 'WST']","[The stock market has been on an absolute tear this year with the S&amp;P 500 up 19% and the Nasdaq 100 up a whopping 42.6% YTD.Stock Strength Nearing ExhaustionNow, while I have no interest in trying to call a top in this market, the indexes have clearly moved into overbought territory, at least in the near-term. The mega-cap technology stocks in particular have accounted for much of the market’s returns, so a rotation out of the sector wouldn’t be unreasonable at this time.As measured by the NAAIM Exposure Index, which shows the average exposure to US equities reported by the survey members, active fund managers are very long stocks. The index is now above 99%, the highest reading since 2021, and all while markets are near YTD highs. This indicator is not predictive, so is not a sell signal, but is worth considering when making trading decisions.NAAIMImage Source: NAAIMDividend Growth StocksIf you are concerned about the massive rallies in tech leading to sharp corrections, then taking profits or adding other positions would be a prudent move. One place to look for solace when the broader stock market corrects is dividend stocks, even better when they have a long history of raising their payments.Companies that have raised their dividend yield for many consecutive years often provide additional degrees of security and can function almost similar to a bond, while offering the upside of a stock.In this article, I will cover three dividend aristocrats that have raised their dividends for a minimum of 29 years consecutively, and have high Zacks Ranks, further improving their near-term expectations. T. Rowe Price TROW, Roper Technologies ROP, and West Pharmaceutical Services WST all have the potential to be appealing investments if the markets take a turn lower.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchWest Pharmaceutical ServicesWest Pharmaceutical Services has been an exceptional stock to own over the last decade, compounding at annual rate of 27.1% over that period.Story continuesWST is a global healthcare company that specializes in the design, development, and manufacturing of innovative pharmaceutical packaging and delivery systems. They offer a wide range of products, including vial seals, stoppers, prefillable syringe systems, and self-injection devices, catering to the pharmaceutical, biotechnology, and medical device industries.WST has raised the dividend payment for 29 years consecutively. Over the last five years the dividend has been increased by an average of 6.2% annually. Although the dividend yield is on the smaller side at 0.2% you can almost guarantee that it will continue to rise for years to come.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchThough current quarter earnings estimates have been revised lower over the last two months, estimates have been upgraded unanimously across all forward timelines. FY23 earnings estimates have been revised higher by 1.3%. FY24 earnings have been revised higher by 1% and are projected to grow 13.1% YoY.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchT. Rowe PriceT. Rowe Price is a renowned global investment management firm based in the United States. With a history spanning several decades, the company provides a wide range of investment products and services to individual and institutional investors.TROW is known for its expertise in actively managed mutual funds and has expanded its offerings to include other investment vehicles like exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and separately managed accounts. The firm is recognized for its commitment to research-driven investment strategies and has established a strong reputation within the financial industry.T. Rowe Price has a hefty dividend yield of 4.1% and has raised the payment by an average of 14.4% annually over the last five years. Additionally, management has raised dividends for 36 consecutive years. Additionally, demonstrating upward trending earnings revisions, TROW currently has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) Rating.TROW is trading at a one-year forward earnings multiple of 17.8x, which is below the market average of 21.3x, and just above its 10-year median of 16x.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchRoper TechnologiesRoper Technologies is a diversified technology company with a global presence. It operates in various industries, including healthcare, transportation, energy, and water, providing specialized software, equipment, and solutions to its customers.Roper Technologies has quite a stranglehold on the industries it makes products for, and just reported better than expected earnings Friday, July 21. EPS of $4.12 beat estimates of $3.99 and sales of $1.53 billion beat estimates of $1.5 billion.Shares are rocketing nearly 4% higher in trading Friday, and the stock is now just 1% below its all-time high. Roper Technologies earnings call was highlighted by 17% growth in FCF in the year, significantly expanded recurring revenue customer base, and raising of FY23 earnings guidance to $16.36 - $16.50.Roper Technologies currently has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), indicating upward trending earnings revisions.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchThe company has a 29-year track record of raising dividends and currently offers a yield of 0.6%. Additionally, ROP has raised its dividend payment by an average of 10.7% annually over the last five years.Roper Technologies is trading at a one-year forward earnings multiple of 29.7x, which is below the industry average of 34.4x, and above its 10-year median of 26.1x.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchBottom LineGiven the extended state of the stock market, I wouldn’t blame any investors for looking to peel off their more profitable positions. However, if you are looking for places to put that money to work, I would recommend looking at dividend growth stocks like those listed above, as they can perform better than the broad market during selloffs. Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

This compares to year-ago revenues of $1.31 billion.

Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter(s), but also how these expectations have changed lately.Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near-term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions. Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried-and-tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank, which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions.Story continuesAhead of this earnings release, the estimate revisions trend for Roper Technologies: favorable.

79,035cd9b7-4881-377d-b5ee-acc0dd33f8b5,WU,2023-07-22,Western Union (WU) to Post Q2 Earnings: Here's What to Expect,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/western-union-wu-post-q2-164600178.html,1689957960,STORY,['WU'],"[The Western Union Company WU is set to report its second-quarter 2023 results on Jul 26, after the closing bell.What Do the Estimates Say?The Zacks Consensus Estimate for second-quarter earnings per share of 38 cents suggests a 25.5% decrease from the prior-year figure of 51 cents. The consensus mark remained stable over the past week. The consensus estimate for second-quarter revenues of $1.1 billion indicates an 8.1% decrease from the year-ago reported figure.Western Union beat the consensus estimate for earnings in two of the trailing four quarters, met once and missed on the other occasion, with the average surprise being 12.2%. This is depicted in the graph below:The Western Union Company Price and EPS SurpriseThe Western Union Company Price and EPS SurpriseThe Western Union Company price-eps-surprise | The Western Union Company QuoteBefore we get into what to expect for the to-be-reported quarter in detail, it’s worth taking a look at WU’s previous-quarter performance first.Q1 Earnings RewindThe leading global money transfer company reported adjusted earnings of 43 cents per share for the previous quarter, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 30.3%. The quarterly results were supported by strength in the Middle East business, Evolve 2025’s momentum, lower consumer acquisition costs and transaction growth. However, adverse currency impact, discontinuation of operations across Russia and Belarus and promotional pricing activities partially offset the positives.Now let’s see how things have shaped up before the second-quarter earnings announcement.Q2 Factors to NoteLower transactions in multiple regions are expected to have affected WU’s C2C Segment in the second quarter. The suspension of operations in Russia and Belarus is anticipated to have been a major contributor to that decline. Also, reduced transactions in Europe, North America and Asia Pacific regions are expected to have affected the metric, partially offset by strength in Latin American and Caribbean regions and the Middle East, Africa and South Asia operations.Story continuesOur estimate for C2C transactions indicates an almost 7% year-over-year decline to 63.5 million in the second quarter. This is likely to have affected the segment’s revenues and profits. Our estimate for the unit’s revenues is pegged at $950.4 million, indicating a 7.4% decrease from the year-ago period. Furthermore, operating income from the segment is expected to have decreased almost 30% from $225.6 million a year ago.With divesting efforts for its Business Solutions operations in the second quarter, revenues and profits from the unit are expected to have declined significantly. Our estimate for revenues from this segment signals an 81.5% year-over-year decrease.The above-mentioned factors are likely to have positioned the company for not only a year-over-year decline but also make an earnings beat uncertain. However, the Other segment, which includes Western Union’s bill payments businesses, as well as retail money order services, is likely to have provided some breathing room for the company in the quarter under review.Our estimate for revenues from the Other segment is pegged at $77.8 million, signaling almost 3% year-over-year growth. We expect operating income from the segment to amount to $24.6 million in the quarter under review. Also, our estimate for total operating expense predicts a 2.6% decline from a year ago, which will provide an impetus to the margins.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively predict an earnings beat for Western Union this time around. The combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) increases the chances of an earnings beat. That is not the case here, as you will see below.Earnings ESP: The company has an Earnings ESP of 0.00%. This is because the Most Accurate Estimate currently stands at 38 cents per share, in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate.You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: Western Union currently carries a Zacks Rank #3.Stocks to ConsiderWhile an earnings beat looks uncertain for Western Union, here are some companies from the broader Business Services space that you may want to consider, as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this time around:S&amp;P Global Inc. SPGI has an Earnings ESP of +1.58% and a Zacks Rank of 2. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for S&amp;P Global’s bottom line for the to-be-reported quarter is pegged at $3.11 per share, indicating 10.7% year-over-year growth. SPGI beat earnings estimates in three of the past four quarters and missed once, with an average surprise of 3.1%.Booz Allen Hamilton Holding Corporation BAH has an Earnings ESP of +3.20% and a Zacks Rank of 2.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Booz Allen’s bottom line for the to-be-reported quarter is pegged at $1.25 per share, which suggests a 10.6% year-over-year jump. BAH beat earnings estimates in all the past four quarters, with an average of 10.2%.Avis Budget Group, Inc. CAR has an Earnings ESP of +1.46% and is a Zacks #2 Ranked player.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Avis Budget’s bottom line for the to-be-reported quarter is pegged at $9.78 per share, which witnessed one upward estimate revision over the past month against no movement in the opposite direction.

My name is Carla, and I will be your conference operator for today. Welcome to the Second Quarter PPG Earnings Conference Call. (Operator Instructions) I would now like to turn the conference over to John Bruno, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.Story continuesJohn BrunoThank you, Carla, and good morning, everyone. Once again, this is John Bruno, and we appreciate your continued interest in PPG and welcome you to our second quarter 2023 financial results conference call. Joining me on the call from PPG are Tim Knavish, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Vince Morales, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.Our comments relate to the financial information released after U.S. equity markets closed on Thursday, July 20, 2023.

The slides are also available on the webcast site for this call and provide additional support to the opening comments Tim will make shortly. Following management's perspective on the company's results for the quarter, we will move to a Q&amp;A session.Both the prepared commentary and discussion during this call may contain forward-looking statements, reflecting the company's current view of future events and their potential effect on PPG's operating and financial performance. These statements involve uncertainties and risks, which may cause actual results to differ. The company is under no obligation to provide subsequent updates to these forward-looking statements.The presentation also contains certain non-GAAP financial measures. The company has provided in the appendix of the presentation materials, which are available on our website, reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures. For additional information, please refer to PPG's filings with the SEC. Now let me introduce PPG President and CEO, Tim Knavish.Timothy M. KnavishThank you, John. and good morning, everyone, and welcome to our second quarter 2023 earnings call. I would like to start by providing a few highlights on our second quarter record financial performance, and then I'll move to our outlook.The PPG team delivered all-time record financial results in the second quarter, including sales of $4.9 billion, adjusted earnings per diluted share from continuing operations of $2.25 and year-to-date cash generation of about $620 million. Our adjusted EPS is about 24% higher than the second quarter of 2022, and cash generation of $750 million higher year-over-year. These strong financial results were achieved despite operating in an environment of variable global economic demand. Industrial production was muted, reflecting cautious consumer buying behavior in Europe and slower-than-expected recovery in China and softening demand in certain end-use markets in the U.S.Overall, our results were supported by good growth trends in several of our technology advantage businesses and leading brands. PPG's strong positioning in these end-use markets led to record second quarter sales in 5 of our 9 businesses: aerospace, automotive, automotive refinish, PPG Comex and our protective and marine coatings business. We implemented incremental price increases in the first half of the year, primarily in the Performance Coatings segment and our aggregate 2-year stack pricing for the company is now about 20%, which is offsetting historically high cost inflation. We expect selling prices to remain positive in the second half of 2023, recognizing prior year price increases will reach anniversaries as the year progresses.As I said in my CEO investor briefing in May, margin recovery is the top near-term priority and we have made great progress this year in improving our segment margins toward our historical profile. Our aggregate segment margins in Q2 were about 16%, which is 330 basis points higher than the second quarter of 2022. This included the Performance Coatings segment delivering margins of near 18%, the highest since 2016.Another key priority for our team has been to return to our legacy of strong cash generation. And through the first half of the year, we delivered record operating cash generation of about $620 million. This was supported by our record net earnings, but we also lowered our inventory levels by about $100 million on a sequential quarterly basis. Despite this reduction, our raw material inventories remain elevated and we are executing various action plans to further reduce these inventory levels over the next several quarters as commodity supply availability has improved significantly this year.Now I'd like to spend a few minutes on 3 key drivers that are contributing to our excellent financial results in 2023. First, while overall global industrial production is challenging, including in a number of industrial end-use markets that are already in recessionary tight demand conditions, our portfolio of business mix is providing great resilience. Through the best-performing global industries in the second quarter were aerospace and auto OEM, we have established leading global positions in each of these end markets by facilitating our customer success through innovative and sustainably advantaged products and much relied upon services.We expect demand for our aerospace and auto OEM coatings products to remain robust as they are both still below 2019 demand levels. Two data points are international flights remain 10% below 2019 prepandemic levels. And over the past several years, lower automotive OEM global builds have resulted in an estimated supply deficit of about 40 million cars versus historical build rates.The second key driver is that we continued to deliver strong earnings performance in Europe as we achieved consecutive quarterly earnings records despite lackluster regional industrial production activity and weak aggregate architectural demand. This has been accomplished by our team's strong execution of cost and margin management. When this region begins to recover to any degree, PPG will be well positioned for solid top line and additional bottom line growth.The third key driver is our strong positioning in Mexico where current economic conditions remain robust, including expansive near-shoring related growth, solid consumer wealth growth and an appreciating local currency. We expect the near-shoring benefits to continue for a number of years, first with capital investment, and then through increased regional employment. PPG remains the clear leader in Mexico for architectural and automotive OEM, and we have actions underway to capture further growth in our other businesses where we will leverage our core strengths, including the best-in-class PPG Comex concessionaire distribution network.I'd also like to comment on our enterprise growth strategy. A key pillar of this strategy is to partner with our customers to deliver superior service and products with a focus on enhancing their productivity and sustainability. In the second quarter, we continued to make advancements and earn several new customer wins. I'm excited about the opportunities we have ahead of us to win more customer value-driven business and grow our organic sales.Now some quick updates about our important ESG initiatives. As we communicated in our 2022 ESG Report, we've introduced 2030 greenhouse gas emissions reduction targets that have now been validated according to climate science through the Science Based Targets initiative. We plan to reduce our Scope 1 and Scope 2 absolute greenhouse gas emissions by 50% by 2030 and our Scope 3 greenhouse gas emissions by 30% within the same time frame.Moving to our outlook. We expect global industrial production to remain at lower levels in the third quarter, including similar demand activity in Europe, some further slowing in the U.S. and modest sequential improvement in China. We do expect certain pockets of industry activity to remain more resilient, including aerospace and automotive industries, where we are well positioned on a global basis. In addition, we expect economic activity in Mexico to remain solid.In our architectural businesses, we expect demand conditions to be mixed by geography. In Europe, we anticipate demand will stabilize at current levels, resulting in year-over-year sales volume being much closer to the prior year. In the U.S., we anticipate DIY demand to remain at lower levels and PRO contractor residential repaint activity to begin the modestly decline sequentially with the backdrop of lower existing home sales. Finally, in Mexico, we expect our PPG Comex business to continue to post solid organic growth.In the third quarter, we expect to realize additional benefits from moderating cost inputs. At the peak of our supply disruptions, we had more than 160 force majeures in our global supply chain. That is now about 10, which is in line with our historical norms. To date, we have not yet recognized the full financial benefit of our commodity supply chain normalizing. From a financial realization perspective, through the end of June, our input costs were still 20% higher than the prepandemic levels. As we further reduce our inventories, we will realize additional earnings benefit.We continue to work on our previously announced restructuring initiatives and expect an incremental $15 million year-over-year earnings benefit in the third quarter. Additionally, we will benefit from the recent paint film acquisition that we made in the second quarter. This business is uniquely positioned in the premium end of this new emerging market and has good customer pull and future growth prospects. Annual sales of this business are about $100 million. Despite the challenging environment, we have raised our full year earnings guidance and expect third quarter aggregated segment margins will be higher on a year-over-year basis for the fourth consecutive quarter. Finally, I want to thank our team members around the world who support our customers, serve our communities and continually look for ways to do better today than yesterday every day. It is their dedication and commitment to helping make our customers successful that gives me continued confidence in our future. As we mark PPG's 140th anniversary in August, I firmly believe that our best days still remain ahead of us.Thank you for your continued confidence in PPG. This concludes our prepared remarks. And now would you please open the line for questions.Question and Answer SessionOperator(Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from the line of Christopher Parkinson.Christopher S. ParkinsonGreat. Can we perhaps just dissect the outlook for Industrial Coatings segment margins a little bit just based on what you're seeing for price cost for the second half of the year; end market mix, given the dichotomy of certain things moving in various directions for your 3Q outlook in your slide deck; comp accruals. Just anything else you think is worthwhile discussing as you progress back towards prior peak?Timothy M. KnavishI'll let Vince answer the comp accruals, but I'll take segment margins and outlook for some of the businesses. Segment margins in Industrial were still on the recovery journey. So we have continued to...(technical difficulty)Okay. Thanks, Chris. So as I started to say, segment margins -- okay. Good. Segment margins in Industrial certainly have more room to grow and we expect that to continue, both from the price cost standpoint, but the other piece of recovery that is really not happened yet that will continue to improve the segment margins on industrial are volumes. Of course, right now, auto OEM is strong but still below 2019. And then we've got some pockets of weakness in industrial and certainly pockets of weakness in packaging. So we will get segment margins as those volumes stabilize.The other thing is the operational challenge that we mentioned at our May event, have largely been in the industrial segment. So as we make progress on those initiatives, those 2 pieces will add to the improvements that will be realized from the continuing price versus cost recovery.And then end markets, to your question, for the industrial segment, automotive has been very resilient, sometimes surprisingly so, despite everything that's happening in the world with interest rates and inflation and affordability. All of our major regions for automotive were up double digits for Q2. And we expect continued strong recovery as we move forward here. We'll be lapping a stronger Q3 for auto based on China, which had a strong Q3 last year. But overall, we'll continue to see good volume recovery.(technical difficulty). We expect that recovery to continue for years to come. (technical difficulty)OperatorHi, everyone. Apologies. We have some issues with the phone lines. Bear with us a second whilst we gain reconnection with the speaker lines.We now have connection with our speaker lines. Please continue.John BrunoApologies, everybody. We're trying to sort through these issues. We'll continue the call right now.Timothy M. KnavishOkay. Chris, I'm back. The positive of technical difficulty is we've had a long time to think about your question. I already answered the segment margin piece. And then from a segment volume and sales and outlook standpoint. Auto, we expect to continue to be strong, Q3 comp issue with China, but that will be -- the whole auto build recovery will continue for beyond '23 and into '24.Industrial is very mixed. Certain segments are doing well. I'll point to powder, for example, where we were up solid double digits, which, as you know from our May event is very important to our growth strategy. But subsegments that are closer to the consumer, electronic materials, appliance and even [coax] for construction are soft. But we do expect that to continue to be a mixed bag.Packaging has been weak with both destocking but also end customer demand given what's happened from an inflation standpoint. So very much a mixed bag, but overall, the summary would be we are expecting industrial segment margins to continue to improve.OperatorYour next question comes from the line of Ghansham Panjabi.Ghansham PanjabiOkay. I guess you had just given all the moving parts on a macro basis, just kind of building on your last few comments, Tim, can you just give us a sense as to how your volume outlook for 2023 has changed since the last time you reported? And which of the businesses are seeing the greatest variability relative to your previous view? And then, separately, apart from packaging, are there still any businesses being impacted by inventory destocking in any material way?Timothy M. KnavishI'll answer your last question first and not really, Ghansham. Destocking is pretty much behind us. And even on the industrial side, they don't carry a lot of inventory anyway. So it's pretty much just-in-time. And then on our performance side, most -- any destocking that's occurred is largely behind us.So what we see outlook-wise across the company, the things that have changed a bit is the recovery in China slower than what we had anticipated. And we're expecting continued improvement in China industrial activity, albeit at a more measured pace going forward. So sequentially improving but not as much of a V-shaped as what we had previously projected.Architectural Europe, I'd say the other one that was lower volume than what we expected in Q2. But a lot of that was driven by kind of one-off social and political events in France, which is one of our largest markets in Europe. So we do believe architectural Europe, I would call it bouncing off the bottom. And we'll start lapping weak comps from last year.And then in the U.S., architecture -- the DIY, not just U.S., around the world, continues to be soft. But overall, we still got more than half of our portfolio that's very resilient, and I would say, has positive outlooks. Auto was stronger than we anticipated. Refinish was stronger than we anticipated. Aero was stronger than we anticipated. PMC was stronger than we anticipated. And Mexico continues to just shoot lights out. So a lot of positives there, but those are the ones that were a little different than what we had previously thought in our guide.OperatorYour next question comes from the line of Josh Spector.Joshua David SpectorCongrats on a solid second quarter here. I just wanted to ask some questions on your 3Q assumptions. So specifically SG&amp;A as a percent of sales and gross margin, I guess my math indicates that the midpoint of your guide to gross margins are maybe 40% or lower. You just printed about 41% in the second quarter and similarly in the first quarter. So what would drive gross margins to go down, especially when you're expecting some raw material benefit? Can you just walk through some of the moving pieces and your assumptions there?Vincent J. MoralesHey, Josh, this is Vince. On SG&amp;A, let me take that one first. We did have a little bit of a higher SG&amp;A in Q2 than the prior year. Really a couple of elements to that. We talked about higher performance-based incentive comp, including total shareholder return compensation. We did have, as we communicated in Q1 higher noncash pension expense for the balance -- for all of 2023 that falls in the SG&amp;A bucket on a year-over-year basis, you could see that. And just a reminder, a lot of our China business was shut down in Q2 of 2022. And some of this increased sales creates increased SG&amp;A. So those 3 elements pushed our SG&amp;A cost up year-over-year. And the incentive comp item was a catch-up for both Q1 and Q2. So again, that's the SG&amp;A component. On the gross profit percent, we did, as you pointed out, we're averaging about 41% year-to-date. Q3 typically is a lower volume quarter for us. We don't have as much operational pull-through as we would on a higher volume quarter, specifically in Europe. So that's really the only delta I would point to. We do expect, as we said in our prepared remarks, higher or improved deflation capture. But again, the lower volumes are going to affect our manufacturing efficiency.OperatorYour next question comes from the line of David Begleiter.David L. BegleiterTim and Vince, you mentioned the weakness -- potential weakness in Pro. Where are the backlog today? And are you actually seeing that weakness yet to come to fruition?Timothy M. KnavishThanks for the question. I would describe the weakness in Pro to be sequentially down a bit, but not a tremendous amount. A lot of that Pro work is commercial and maintenance that still remains pretty resilient. But we have seen some reduction in backlog. But honestly, the painters are still, in some cases, having difficulty getting labor. So there are cases where they're passing on jobs because of that. So while we've seen DIY down fairly significantly, I would just say we're seeing just a bit of softness in the PRO backlogs.OperatorYour next question comes from the line of Jeffrey Zekauskas.Jeffrey John ZekauskasTwo-part question. Can you talk about the state of the Chinese TiO2 industry in that there's enormous expense (inaudible). Can you use that product in China and in other regions of China chloride-based material. And is it the case that tariffs are just too high to use it in the United States? And secondly, in your script, you say that 80% of your inventories are on FIFO. I thought most of your inventories in the United States were on LIFO. So does that mean that the inventory adjustments that you really need to make are in the offshore markets and your inventory control is pretty good in the U.S. and it's tougher abroad.Vincent J. MoralesJeff, this is Vince. We had a little breakup on your question, but I think you asked about TiO2 oversupply in China. And we do -- we are able to take Chinese TiO2 and are and have been for quite some time, utilizing that. Certainly in Europe, certainly in Latin America, South America, and obviously in Asia. And there are tariffs that make it less cost-effective today to do so in the U.S. but we are fully utilizing our capabilities to move that TiO2 to other markets or other regions of the world outside of Asia and capitalizing on those lower prices.John BrunoJeff, this is John. I'll take the FIFO question. So first start with the sales, we have our profile in the U.S. We're now about 35% sales in the U.S. And in the past 5, 6 years, as we've made acquisitions in the U.S., the companies we've acquired have been on FIFO. So we have not moved them to the LIFO accounting. So over time, the percentage of inventory that we have on the FIFO method has just incrementally increased due to those factors.Vincent J. MoralesTo just add on there -- I apologize. Just to add on, my apologies, just to add on, as John mentioned, we do have excess inventory, specifically in raw materials. If you look at our inventory historically, we've trimmed about 50% of the excess raw material inventory that we came into the year with -- in the first 6 months. So we'll be working in the balance of the year to trim the other portion to get back to our historical level.OperatorYour next question comes from the line of Stephen V. Byrne.Stephen V. ByrneYes. If I understood you correctly, Tim, you talked about raws and I believe it was in COGS still being 20% above prepandemic. And Vince, you just highlighted, you're still sitting on excess inventory of raws. My question would be for raws purchased today, what would be the cost relative to prepandemic? And how long do you think that it will take for that to flow through COGS?Vincent J. MoralesYes, Steve, I'll take the first stab at that and Tim will add some color here. So what we're seeing today on invoice costs, as we said last quarter, invoice to invoice year-over-year mid- to high single digit and maybe in some cases low double-digit deflation on certain raw materials. I would remind everybody, these raw materials went up 20%, 30%, 40%. So when you do it on a multiyear stack, we're still much higher, but we're seeing on a year-over-year basis on invoices mid- to high to low -- mid- to high single to low double-digit declines that typically would flow through in 30 to 60 days or even 90 depending on the raw material. And again, that's extended right now.Timothy M. KnavishYes. In bottom line, Steve, when you combine that with the additional $100 million or so of inventory that we've got to work through that we're sitting on now, you've got sequentially more raw material deflation combined with that additional inventory flow through. That's why I'm so confident that our margin recovery journey will continue.OperatorYour next question comes from John McNulty.John Patrick McNultySo Tim, in your prepared remarks, you spoke to pricing continuing through the second half of the year. I guess, just because the comps are kind of pretty dramatic year-over-year, I guess can you help us to think about whether you're going to see pricing sequentially from 2Q to 3Q and how we should be thinking about that?Timothy M. KnavishYes. Most of what we're seeing, John, is a carryover impact. There will be some targeted pricing that we do in Performance Coatings. But a lot of what you'll see going forward here for the remainder of '23 will be carried over. And to your point, we are lapping some strong price quarters from last year. So if you look at -- we printed 8% for Q1, 6% for Q2. So you'll probably see low single-digit pricing printed in Q3. Still a little early to tell in Q4. We're confident it will be positive, but we'll see what happens and what other actions we might need to take.Vincent J. MoralesAnd just to tag along here. We still expect that at price -- the raw material delta to expand as we talked about the prior question, which is we expect more -- to realize more deflation as we pull down our inventories.Timothy M. KnavishThe other thing -- I mean, the pricing has been holding up very nicely. I'm proud of how our teams are executing to that regard. And so our price story, someone earlier asked about what's different in our guide versus earlier, our price story is stronger than what our prior guides were.OperatorYour next question comes from the line of Vincent Andrews.Vincent Stephen AndrewsJust a question on the wage inflation and I say it remain elevated for the next few quarters. Is that as you have to lap the flow-through of some wage increases from prior quarters? Or is there more going in? And if you can size it a little bit, just to help us understand how much of a headwind that is versus the raw material benefits that you're getting?Timothy M. KnavishYes, Vincent, we do have, no surprise, higher than normal wage inflation. I'd say in the mature markets average, you could call that about 3%, but higher than that on front-line workers like store workers. But 3% would be a good average. Emerging markets higher than that. And then from a raw material inflation standpoint, we're still at that 20%-ish number versus prepandemic. And we're expecting Q3 to see mid- to high single digits down. So we expect the combination of those 2 to still keep us at elevated cost versus prepandemic, but improving sequentially as we move through the rest of the year.Vincent J. MoralesAnd as we look at the trend lines, we're not seeing the trends change in terms of increase or decrease of wages. We provided at our merit process or our wage increase process earlier in the year and we typically would do that once a year for most of our employees. So that trend should hold for the balance of the year.OperatorYour next question comes from the line of Duffy Fischer.Patrick Duffy FischerJust a question around the EPS and the guide for Q3 and the implied for Q4. So in Q1 and Q2, your year-over-year number was up $0.45 and $0.44. The guide midpoint for Q3 and then the implied for Q4 is up $0.24 and $0.19 year-on-year. With raw material deflation accelerating for you guys and price still up in the back half, as you're commenting, why would the year-over-year EPS improvement decline in the back half versus the first half?Timothy M. KnavishDuffy, the biggest driver to that would just be the quarter-over-quarter price actions. Most of the larger price increases for us started to kick in like Q3 of last year. So as we lap those and less new pricing, if you will, adding to the top, that's really the biggest difference.OperatorYour next question comes from the line of Patrick Cunningham.Patrick David CunninghamSo increasing interest rates are clearly showing up in existing home sales and you cited softness in resi repaint. Now I want to talk a little bit about non-resi. While it appears to be strong or maybe hanging in there, how should we think about the risk to commercial volumes in the back half and in 2024, given the higher interest rate environment and starting to see some deceleration in commercial construction and remodeling indices?Timothy M. KnavishWell, I'd say in the short term, that's not -- frankly, for the rest of '23, not something we're particularly concerned about because there was such a backlog in those areas. If you think about the really bifurcation of painting activity that happened during COVID, you had a tremendous amount of resi painting happening but you had virtually no commercial and maintenance painting happening. So there's still a tremendous amount of pent-up demand in that space. Now eventually, we'll see what happens with interest rates and macros in the longer term. But that's -- we're just not seeing that right now being a major concern for us.OperatorYour next question comes from the line of Michael Leithead.Michael James LeitheadGreat. Just one question for me on traffic solutions. I think you expected sales to be up high single digits in 2Q and they were down low single digits. So just can you talk through what drove the delta versus what you thought [in April]?Timothy M. KnavishYes. So part of it was comp related. We had a really strong Q2, Q3 last year in that business. Secondly, it's still a new business for us and we're still learning the market a bit. And this is an area where we did see some, I'd say, temporary shift in paint volumes as activities picked up. And so we expect to get that back as we move forward through the rest of the year and certainly into next year. We have been focused very heavily on margin over volume in that business, and the team has done a great job there.And the last thing I'll say to that is while the volumes did come in a bit lower than we expected for the quarter, this business is generating good cash for us, really good cash, and it will be a good contributor to the enterprise from that standpoint.OperatorYour next question comes from the line of Frank Mitsch.Frank Joseph MitschNice results. Obviously, you guys generated some strong cash flow in the first half of the year, but the question on the use of cash. Debt paydown is part of it, but how do you think about buybacks versus M&amp;A? I know, Tim, you've talked about right property, right price, right time. Is this the right time? Are you seeing the right price? Any thoughts there would be greatly appreciated.Timothy M. KnavishYes. Thanks, Frank. Proud of the team, great second quarter and getting back to one of our strong legacies of just really strong cash generation. And as you noted, our #1 priority was to pay down some debt. We said earlier this year we would pay somewhere between $500 million and $600 million down. We paid about $200 million of that down so far this year. So we've got a bit more of that to do. But I'll tell you, we're going to have a really good cash year. We're going to have a really good cash year, which gives us a lot of optionality. Probably not -- time to talk about specific actions on the M&amp;A side, but that's clearly remains a priority for us. And we are seeing properties come across our desks there. But bottom line, we're going to have a really good cash generation year. We're going to pay down some more debt. And then we're going to make decisions on how best to use that cash to deliver shareholder value based on what we see at the time.Vincent J. MoralesAnd just to reiterate what we said in May in New York, we're not going to -- after we pay down this debt, we're not going to let cash grow on the balance sheet.OperatorYour next question comes from the line Aleksey Yefremov.Aleksey V. YefremovWe've recently seen somewhat better data on new residential construction in the U.S. What do you see in your business in this market? Have your expectations here improved at all in the last 3 months? And then separately, are you seeing any meaningful pickup in the U.S. infrastructure spending?Timothy M. KnavishSo on the new builds, we are starting to see a little bit better activity there on new home construction. We've said in prior calls it's a fairly small part of our overall business, but it's not zero and we've had a couple of nice wins recently with some new homebuilders. So bottom line, any walls -- any additional walls that get painted in the U.S., Mexico, Europe, Australia is good for us. That's upside to us. So that would be the first one. The second part of your question?Aleksey V. YefremovInfrastructure. It was about U.S. infrastructure.Timothy M. KnavishAll right. Thank you, thank you. U.S. infrastructure. We are starting to see, I would call it, upstream project activity and we're very active in the specification side of ensuring that our products are well specified, whether it's traffic or protective coatings or architectural coatings or industrial coatings. Typically, paint and coatings are late stage in those projects, sometimes last stage in those projects. So this is more of a '24 and beyond growth opportunity for us, but we're certainly seeing that upstream activity happening now. We're excited about it, and we're very active with it.Vincent J. MoralesAnd if I could add, it's not a U.S. comment, but it's a Mexico comment. We are seeing a significant amount of near-shoring occur in Mexico. Several hundreds of building permits for manufacturing facilities have been requested. Those will yield benefits for us, certainly in '24 and '25, as that manufacturing is put in place. And then as Tim mentioned earlier, we have a full-fledged array of PPG businesses in Mexico to facilitate further painting once that industrial activity picks up as well as our strong Comex brand.Timothy M. KnavishYes, just to put some metrics around that Mexico near-shoring. In Q1 of this year, there's about $48 billion of near-shoring investments in Mexico. That's 3x, 3x Q1 of 2022. So we are really seeing that pickup and we're involved in the specification side of that business as well.OperatorYour next question comes from the line of Mike Harrison.Michael Joseph HarrisonWanted to ask about auto OEM and the price realization that you're seeing there. Is there more still to come on pricing in auto OEM? And are there any instances where you're starting to see some customer pushback related to raw material declines either in auto OEM or any other subsegment?Vincent J. MoralesYes, Mike, this is Vince. Let me start and I'm sure Tim will add some color here. But it's taken us a while, as it typically does, during an inflation cycle to negotiate with our customers, get paid for the value we provide. So we had a lag on the way up in terms of the inflation versus price to our OEM customers. We're in a steady-state environment now. We're not seeing any pushback. We're still trying to capture -- as the volume grows, we're still trying to capture our margins back in that business. But we're not seeing any pushback at this point from the customers. And again, that's traditional lag effect that we would see in any inflation cycle.Timothy M. KnavishAnd to your broader question about other segments, I would say normal market dynamics, nothing significant, nothing material. There's been some intense competitive pressure just around the edges. But at the core, we haven't really seen anything that was unexpected or out of the normal.OperatorYour next question comes from John Roberts.John Ezekiel E. RobertsRefinish organic sales were up mid-single digit. I don't know what pricing was up, but the Performance segment was up 6%. Refinish volumes globally flat. And when you talk about it being better than expected, was price better than expected? Or was volume better than expected?Timothy M. KnavishYes. John, volume was positive here in the U.S., which, of course, is our most -- our largest and most critical market. And that was better than we expected. Volume in Europe, I would say, was worse than we expected. Volume down there a bit more than we thought. And then volume in China a little bit muted because of the slower recovery, but we see that sequentially improving as time goes on. But overall, a great quarter for that business, really bullish on particularly the U.S. side, and we're watching closely what happens on the Europe side.Vincent J. MoralesOn the Europe side, we talked about destock earlier in the call here, and we think in Q2, there was some destocking with certain refinish customers. We think that's concluded by the end of Q2. So again, as we get to the back half of the year, we would expect the demand and the volumes to be more in sync.OperatorYour next question comes from the line of Michael Sison.Michael Joseph SisonNice quarter. In terms of the half of your portfolio that's in decline or weak, do you think those markets are bottoming or potentially bottom here in the third quarter? And then when I take a look at your volume outlook, third quarter seems to be down year-over-year again. And just wanted to get your thoughts on the fourth and how you see that sort of unfolding?Timothy M. KnavishYes. So I'll take a few of the markets that were lower volume than what we expected for Q2 and how we're thinking about them going forward. First one, architectural Europe was -- that was clearly down more than we expected, but some of that isolated to France, as I mentioned earlier. I do expect that to start comping pretty close, maybe even a little upside from where we were at Q3 of last year. So I've used the term bouncing off the bottom. I do believe that Europe architecture is bouncing off the bottom and maybe a little bit of upside there.The China recovery, slower than we expected in Q2, no doubt. But the way we're thinking about that is -- that just stretches out the recovery, positive -- any stimulus that the government does in the industrial space will be a real positive for PPG. And we do expect China to sequentially improve. So those would be the 2 main ones I would point out as far as what we saw in Q2 and potentially improving in Q3 and beyond.Vincent J. MoralesYes, Mike, and I think there is a comparable -- year-over-year comparable issue as you look at volume. So we do have improving volumes, as Tim mentioned, in China sequentially in Q3, but that was compared to a recovery from COVID shutdown last year Q3. So again, when you look at -- you mentioned year-over-year volume challenges, that's -- again, China is improving as we look Q2 to Q3, but it's against a tough comp.OperatorYour next question comes from the line of Kevin McCarthy.Kevin William McCarthyYes. Tim, a two-part question for you on auto OEM volumes. So first, could you speak to the outlook for the back half of the year if some of the consultants are to be believed, it looks like there's quite divergent trends in Asia versus Europe, for example. So curious to understand what you're baking in there? And then longer term, you referenced the supply deficit of 40 million units. Is the implication that, that is the amount that needs to be recovered over some period of time? How do you view the medium to longer-term outlook for global production?Vincent J. MoralesKevin, this is Vince. I'll start and I'll let Tim add here. But just a reminder, again, just the same question we had the last -- the last question. China had a recovery in Q3 last year in auto production. So again, the numbers, when you look on a year-over-year basis are a bit skewed.Timothy M. KnavishYes. So Kevin, we're bullish on auto despite some of the -- kind of affordability and interest rate questions. And here's why: we continue to be positively surprised by performance in Europe, for example, where macros are worse than anywhere and yet the builds and sales remain resilient. The U.S. SAAR when everybody was predicting that would drop was -- came in at a nice number of 15.8, which was a positive surprise, but still well below historical levels.We're starting to see -- we're seeing really good numbers out of China. Double-digit builds in China growth Q2. As Vince mentioned, we have a little weird comp situation here in Q3, but we do expect that to recover. So we're bullish on auto. We are bullish on auto for both the short term and medium term. Now the 40 million is just straight math. You take the 6-year average before COVID of annual builds and you take what happened during COVID and you come up with a 40 million deficit. I have no idea how long it's going to take to make up that deficit and how spread out that will be. But it's not going to be zero. That deficit will need to be made up because in many countries, you still have population growth. In many countries, you still have cars per capita or cars per household being much lower than the developed world. And you've still got aging fleets. In mature parts of the world, U.S., Europe, average cars in a row is like 11 or 12 years old. So the fundamentals say, at some point, some significant part of that 40 million deficit needs to be made up. It's a question of how stretched out that will be.OperatorYour next question comes from the line of Aron Ceccarelli.Aron CeccarelliI have one on segment margins. So your segment margins expanded 330 basis points in Q2, and they were expanded 370 in Q1. I understand we are past the peak in terms of pricing initiatives, but we start to see really the widening gap of raw materials going down. And some of the volumes you are talking in the weak markets are bottoming. So what could prevent margins in Q2 and Q3 to expand -- to accelerate in terms of expansion again?Vincent J. MoralesYes. I mean I think we -- I think we talked about this a little earlier in the call. We do expect, again, incremental deflation to flow through to our P&amp;L. We're starting to lap some pricing. We do -- especially in the industrial businesses, we do see volume as the biggest catalyst in the back half of the year or in 2024 to help improve the margins as well, as Tim mentioned earlier, manufacturing -- PPG manufacturing as a key element. And we laid that out in our May New York meeting. So those would be the 4 key elements that I would point to that would impact our margins in the back half of the year.OperatorYour next question comes from the line of Laurence Alexander.Laurence AlexanderJust a quick one. What's the net drag for earnings and margins from the destocking you're doing this year? Just trying to think about kind of how that translates into the bridge for next year.Vincent J. MoralesIt's an interesting question, Laurence. I'm doing the math in my head as we speak. But again, what we're seeing is, let's call it, mid- to high single-digit deflation on our invoices. We're realizing mid-single-digit inflation through our P&amp;L. So I'm going to guess that, that's $0.05 to $0.10 a quarter, looking at John here to make sure my math is proper. But that would be the delay that's not coming through on a real-time basis into our P&amp;L.OperatorYour next question comes from the line of Arun Viswanathan.Arun Shankar ViswanathanJust wanted to understand kind of the volume outlook overall. It sounds like, obviously, aerospace and automotive OEM volumes have been trending positively and you expect that to continue. Now you're calling out some weakness in packaging and some of the other markets. So is there a path to -- maybe overall positive volumes by the first half of next year given some easier comps in some of these industrial businesses and maybe persistence of volume growth in auto and aerospace? How are you thinking about that kind of volume growth overall trends for the next couple of periods.Timothy M. KnavishYes, Arun, great question and when we talk about a lot, I'll first qualify it by saying -- it's still pretty early, given all the macro stuff that's happening around the world to really nail in our 2024 volume assumptions. But I will tell you that I'm optimistic based on a few things. We've talked a lot about auto and aerospace and Mexico and refinish and we fully expect those businesses to continue to perform.In addition to that, I've talked about a few businesses that we think are bouncing off the bottom and they're not small businesses for us. So eventually, bouncing off the bottom will turn to positive.China. China, we have a really strong presence in China. China ramp-up and recovery has been slower than expected. But if you think about that for 2024, that's a positive, particularly with any government stimulus. And the last one I would point out is Europe. And while Europe volume has been very muted for the first half of the year, we still printed all-time record earnings in Q1, all-time record earnings in Q2. So the team has done a great job of positioning from both a margin and cost base standpoint. So any incremental uptick in volume across any of those businesses in Europe will be a real positive for us.So still a little early. We'll talk more about that in the next earnings call, but there are a lot of indicators that could point to positive volume for us for 2024.OperatorThere are no further questions at this time. I turn the call back over to John Bruno.John BrunoThank you, Carla. This ends our second quarter earnings call. We appreciate everybody's interest and confidence in PPG. Have a good day.OperatorThis concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect.]"

The upside in sales can be attributed to higher selling prices. The top line missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $4,894.3 million.Aggregate segment margins saw a significant improvement of 330 basis points from the prior-year second quarter, attributed to strong selling price realization and lower raw material costs.PPG Industries, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS SurprisePPG Industries, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS SurprisePPG Industries, Inc. price-consensus-eps-surprise-chart | PPG Industries, Inc. QuoteSegment ReviewThe Performance Coatings segment’s second-quarter revenues increased 4% year over year to $3,041 million. The figure fell short of our estimate of $3,046.2 million. This increase in net sales was primarily attributed to higher selling prices across all businesses and favorable foreign currency translation, which effectively mitigated the impact of lower sales volumes.The Industrial Coatings segment achieved revenues of $1,831 million, a 4% year-over-year increase, primarily propelled by higher selling prices, partly offset by lower sales volumes. The figure was ahead of our estimate of $1,749.7 million. Organic sales of Automotive OEM coatings rose due to higher volumes and prices.FinancialsAt the end of the quarter, the company held approximately $1.3 billion in cash and short-term investments. The net debt decreased to $5.6 billion, marking a reduction of about $500 million compared to the same period in the previous year.Corporate expenses amounted to $85 million during the second quarter, showing an increase of $30 million from the prior year. This rise was primarily attributed to stock-based compensation related to total shareholder return and other performance-based incentive compensation, as well as non-cash pension expense.Story continuesThe successful implementation of acquisition-related synergies and business restructuring programs resulted in approximately $15 million of additional cost savings during the quarter.OutlookThe company's projected adjusted EPS for the third quarter is in the range of $1.85-$1.95. For the full year, the company raised its adjusted EPS projection to the range of $7.28-$7.48. These projections consider various factors such as current global economic activity, soft global industrial production, continued economic uncertainty associated with geopolitical issues in Europe, and higher interest rates in most developed countries.The company expects performance coatings demand in Europe to stabilize at lower levels than the pre-conflict period in Ukrainewhile raw material and transportation normalize closer to pre-pandemic levels.For Industrial coatings, PPG anticipate a low single-digit percentage decline in organic sales due to lower global industrial production, except for modest growth in China. Other industrial end-use markets are expected to be soft. However, selling price increases are expected to continue.Price PerformancePPG Industries shares have risen 21.8% in the past year compared with the industry’s rise of 12.3% over the same period.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchZacks Rank &amp; Other Key PicksPPG Industries currently carries a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).Some other top-ranked stocks in the Basic Materials space include Livent Corporation LTHM,and Carpenter Technology Corporation CRS, both sporting a Zacks Rank #1, and United States Steel Corporation X, carrying a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) at present.

In previews, ""Barbie"" earned $23 million compared to ""Oppenheimer"" which earned $10.5 million. Box Office Guru Founder and Editor Gitesh Pandya tells Yahoo Finance Live ""this is a pop culture moment"" noting that with both films, the ""target audiences get exactly what they're looking for.""Video TranscriptSEANA SMITH: The ""Barbie"" movie is officially in theaters. And it's already blowing away the competition. Barbie raking in over $22 million at the domestic box office on Thursday previews beating ""Oppenheimer"" handily by more than $10 million. Our next guest has seen both of these movies. Joining us now, I want to bring in Gitesh Pandya. He's editor of boxofficeguru.com.Gitesh, great to have you here. So let's start with ""Barbie"" since that has been a lot of our focus here. That's expected to be the outperformer this weekend. There's been so much hype ahead of this weekend for the box office. Does Barbie live up to it?GITESH PANDYA: Well, I think it depends on what you're looking for. I think the target audience absolutely gets what they're looking for. This is a pop culture moment. You also have the whole Barbenheimer aspect of it which is separate.But this is the bigger of the two movies. It was always going to do better. $22.3 million from Thursday night pre-shows. That includes some of the Wednesday ""Barbie"" blowout shows. So I'm tracking this one to do well over $100 million this weekend, probably over $125 million for this opening weekend which would be the second biggest opening of the whole year.In fact, the Thursday pre-shows were the biggest of any movie this year to date. So the sales are huge. The word of mouth is very strong. It's at around 90% on Rotten Tomatoes audience score, so the people are liking it. And because of this whole double feature phenomenon, there's a lot of people who haven't seen it yet.Story continuesThey're planning to go Friday, Saturday, and Sunday. So there's a lot of business up ahead. I do wonder a little bit about the long-term picture here. You might have a lot of people go up front and then less business later on.- So let's talk then about ""Oppenheimer"" where we just had the graphic up, expectations for a slower opening weekend for that film. Do you think that one might have a longer tail? Or I guess as you think about these two movies that seem to be capturing popular attention in a way that we haven't seen too many films do over the last few years, what is it maybe that you think ""Oppenheimer"" is channeling in a different way with that kind of energy?GITESH PANDYA: Well, it's certainly a very Oscar-type of a film. And I've been tracking box office for over 30 years. I've never seen anything like this. Barbenheimer, two very different movies being put together in the conversation. People are talking about both at the same time.""Oppenheimer"" was always expected to be the smaller of the two films. Nothing new there. It's not a brand or an IP or anything. But this is a film where the director is the brand. And you're going to see a longer tail on this one, because of the word of mouth will be a little bit better moving forward.- So I guess in thinking then about we haven't seen anything like this before, I'm curious what you make of the way movies are marketed, but the way maybe they catch steam on, like, TikTok, right?Remember the-- when was the ""Gentleminions"" thing? Was that last year or two years ago? Like, all of a sudden you got teenagers dressing in suits going to see a ""Minions"" movie. No one's quite sure why.GITESH PANDYA: Yeah.- But as you know, CMOs everywhere were saying, how do we make this happen? So in your view, how are theaters or studios succeeding, failing, flailing in trying to get that kind of organic-- it's not organic, but seemingly organic--GITESH PANDYA: Yeah, it's semi-organic. It's critical. It's absolutely critical to the overall picture, because this is how people communicate. This is how people talk about things, how something gets hot. And Barbenheimer came up through the people.Two different studios never joined forces to market their two movies together when they opened on the same day. That never happens. So this is the people coming up and saying, listen, I'm interested in both movies. I'm going to make fan art, spread it around social media, and then sort of the whole chatter kind of came from there.And now, what it's good for is for the business, because it's expanding the marketplace. Two films opening this big, probably over $200 million in combined sales this weekend, you almost never see that. So the marketplace expands. It's a global phenomenon, because the overseas sales are very good on ""Barbie"" as well and also for ""Oppenheimer. "" So you've got more people going to the movies, and that's something that the studios really need right now.SEANA SMITH: When it comes to ""Barbie,"" this is obviously a nostalgia play when they're really marketing to people who used to play with Barbies 20, 30 years ago, Mattel has a whole slew of films that they are lined up here for some of their past hit toys, ""Hot Wheels,"" ""Thomas the Tank Engine,"" just to name a few of them. Are we going to see this type of success and this type of hype, do you think, for those installments or is this hype very Barbie-specific?GITESH PANDYA: Well, it's very Barbie-specific. I think that-- there's no guarantees for the future projects. You have to make a good film. Greta Gerwig has done some terrific films before. They hired her to make ""Barbie."" And she did a bang up job here.This is great with the critics, great with the audiences. People are loving it. I'm sure Warner Brothers will pull up with a dump truck full of money to make her do part two sometime after the strikes are all over. So it depends on how well you make it. I think some of those Mattel movies might flop if they're not made well. But if you look at different IP, people are turning everything into a movie, video games, toys. There was ""G.I. Joe."" There was ""Transformers."" There's ""Barbie."" So if you make it well, people will come.- And maybe it's just me floating into your area of expertise. But I think I just wonder when if ever we reach sequel saturation-- and perhaps it's just a misread that this is the way it's always been, and so we're just kind of making up something that doesn't exist. But in your view as someone who follows this week in and week out, has there actually been a market uptick in sequels and does It feel like audiences want something new rather than the 19th or 20th Marvel, however many of those movies there have been?GITESH PANDYA: Well, I think sequel fatigue is something about talk and not action. We talk about sequel fatigue. There's too many. Why do they keep making them? But if you look at the action, if you look at what people are buying tickets for every single year without fail, the sequels are the ones who are maybe 7 of the top 10, 8 of the top 10 every single year.So people keep coming out for the sequels, but there's room for original, if you call it original, or some new IP becoming a first of its kind movie. ""Super Mario Brothers"" which is not a sequel is the highest grossing movie of this year. ""Barbie"" is about to have one of the biggest openings of this year.So there are movies which are not sequels, but based on IP, they have a built-in audience which are becoming blockbusters. And I see more of that coming in. But you do have to have some room for the Oppenheimers of the world where you have directors that people really trust. And they'll go see anything he or she makes, and that's why you have this weekend with two different movies at the same time.SEANA SMITH: Gitesh, there has been though some chatter online people very upset with the strikes that are happening, the treatment of actors, writers here by the studios. And there's been some talk that maybe people are going to boycott the movie theaters over the coming weekends. How big of a concern is that within the industry?GITESH PANDYA: Not much of a concern. I think as far as the movie theaters go, it's really product-driven. People love ""Barbie."" They love ""Oppenheimer."" ""Mission Impossible"" still out there doing well. There's some new movies coming out in August and September and so on, horror films coming up this fall. So people will still go out for those films.The difference you'll see is that the actors on strike will not be promoting their films. And so that makes a big difference. And some studios will have to make the call, our stars will not be promoting this film, do we still release it as is or do we push it to later when we hope the strike is over if they need them to be on social media and promoting their films? Or is it a big brand that sells itself and then you can just kind of put it out there in the marketplace anyway? But I don't see consumers boycotting movie theaters all that much right now.]"

93,a6ff53ff-5ec4-3c95-b09e-fc90e5b749f9,MAT,2023-07-22,'Barbenheimer' arrives as moviegoers flock to a Mattel-mushroom cloud double feature,AP Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/barbenheimer-arrives-moviegoers-flock-mattel-171956217.html,1689959996.0,STORY,"['MAT', 'OPY']","[NEW YORK (AP) — Waves of pink-clad moviegoers passed under cardboard palm trees on the frenzied first day of “Barbenheimer.”After a feverish drumbeat propelled forward by a mushroom cloud of memes, the most anticipated day on the year’s movie calendar finally arrived as “Barbie” and “Oppenheimer” — two movie opposites brought together by cross-marketing fate — landed in theaters.“I think it’s the contrast,” said Lucy Ruiz, 17, as she and a friend made their way into the first showing of “Barbie” on Thursday at the Alamo Drafthouse in Yonkers, New York. “If you want to do both in the same day, it’s like two sides of the same coin.”For Ruiz, the second half of her “Barbenheimer” would have to wait. “Maybe next week,” she said of seeing “Oppenheimer.”But many are flocking to see both on opening weekend. The National Association of Theater Owners says some 200,000 moviegoers in North America have booked same-day tickets to each movie. The movie of the summer has turned out to be not “Indiana Jones” or “The Flash,” but a double feature.“I don’t think I’ve seen anything like this,” says Michael O’Leary, president of the theater association, who compared the phenomenon to a sold-out Taylor Swift concert tour. “But while that’s an amazing special event that captures the cultural attention, it’s not accessible to everybody the way these two movies are. This is a phenomenon open to everyone, regardless of where they live.”As of Friday, it was already clear “Barbenheimer” had morphed into the movie event of the year. The collision of Greta Gerwig’s bright satire of the Mattel doll and Christopher Nolan’s three-hour opus on J. Robert Oppenheimer, the so-called father of the atomic bomb, wasn’t cannibalizing ticket sales for either but fueling excitement for the most jarring and color-clashing of movie weekends.Studios forecasts had hovered around an $80 million opening weekend for “Barbie” and about $40 million for “Oppenheimer.” But it’s likely that both will greatly exceed those totals, and maybe even — especially in the case of “Barbie” — double them.Story continuesWarner Bros. said Friday that “Barbie” took in $22.5 million in Thursday previews, the best such tally of the year and a clear sign that the film will easily sail past $100 million for the weekend. Universal Pictures’ “Oppenheimer” notched $10.5 million in preshow ticket sales, a likewise strong start.“Barbenheimer” is poised to be not just a viral trend but a box-office behemoth. For a movie industry that still hasn’t entirely recovered its pre-pandemic footing, it’s a much-needed jolt of moviegoing joy in a summer season where many of the top releases have fallen shy of expectations. Overall sales on the year are running about 20% below the box-office pace of 2019.As much as the “Barbenheimer” fanfare has been driven by internet fascination, it’s in many ways an old-school movie weekend. Both movies are roundly acclaimed, original works by two of the best filmmakers working today. “Oppenheimer” has been hailed as a masterpiece; in my review, I called it “a kinetic thing of dark, imposing beauty.” The Associated Press' Jocelyn Noveck called “Barbie” “brash, clever, idea-packed (if ultimately TOO packed) and most of all eye-poppingly lovely.”For some moviegoers, “Barbenheimer” is their first blush with the once common practice of catching a double feature. Jack Robinson, 17, had tickets to see both movies with friends Saturday. He planned to don a suit for “Oppenheimer” before changing into pink for “Barbie.”“I used to go to the movies a lot with my family and friends before corona happened. I’m very excited,” said Robinson. “It’ll be interesting to not leave the movie theater. Usually, it’s like bathroom and go home.”In recent years, theater owners have often bemoaned not having enough films in the marketplace as streaming made inroads and studios increasingly concentrated their release schedules on fewer but bigger films. But “Barbenheimer” points to the possible reward when a varied group of films collective rise the box-office tide.“Barbenheimer” may have momentarily eclipsed last week’s top film, “Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning Part One"" — which, despite Tom Cruise’s lobbying, is losing IMAX screens to “Oppenheimer” this weekend. But having three big movies in close proximity to one other, O’Leary said, “is a good problem to have.”“It’s certainly preferable to the alternative,” said O’Leary.Parrot Analytics found that global demand for the casts of each film — all of whom have been publicly enthusiastic about seeing their rival movie — grew at virtually the same rate between late April and mid-July. The audience demographics are almost opposite one another. “Barbie” is appealing to a largely female and younger audience, while “Oppenheimer” is most popular with males and those over the age of 30, Parrot found.Yet in a much-divided America, “Barbenheimer” has been the great pop-culture unifier of 2023. There is harmony in contrast.“I’m doing ‘Barbie’ first and then ‘Oppenheimer’ because I know ‘Oppenheimer’ is going to be something I have to digest,” says Jill Kupnick of Brooklyn.Movie theaters are catering to the “Barbenheimer” phenomenon with double feature tickets and plenty of “Barbie”-themed promotions of candy and cocktails. But most are programming their own “Barbenheimer” days. Freelance writer Kelsey Weekman called it “the closest we’ve come to having school spirit week as adults.”“I have a friend who has outfits picked out and knows how she’s styling her hair,” Krupnick says. “There’s a level of play involved that you rarely see in more mainstream cinema. It’s more common with Marvel movies or in the fantasy genre than something like this.”“Barbie” and “Oppenheimer” have melded together so much that it’s become possible — despite their vast differences — to confuse one for the other. At the Yonkers Alamo Drafthouse, a sharply dressed man wearing a pink shirt beneath a blazer inquired about showtimes for “Oppenheimer.”A clerk courteously answered and then, noticing the man’s attire, asked, “Did you want times for ‘Barbie,’ too?”___Follow AP Film Writer Jake Coyle on Twitter at: http://twitter.com/jakecoyleAP]"

MAT reported adjusted earnings of 18 cents per share in the year-ago quarter.For revenues, the consensus mark is pegged at $989.5 million, suggesting a decline of 19.9% from the year-earlier quarter’s reported figure.Factors at PlayDismal North America and international revenues are likely to affect Mattel’s second-quarter 2023 results. This decline is subject to bleak performances of Infant, Toddler and Preschool (including Fisher-Price, and Thomas &amp; Friends), Dolls (including Barbie), Action Figures, Building Sets, Games and Other.Our model predicts North America and international revenues to decline 22.5% and 17.8% year over year to $588.1 million and $391.7 million, respectively. Further, we expect North America gross billings to decline 23.5% in the quarter to be reported.The company’s bottom line is likely to have been affected by inventory obsolescence expense, higher input cost inflation, unfavorable fixed cost absorption and higher royalty costs. We estimate MAT’s adjusted gross profit to decline 15% year over year $471.2 million.However, Mattel is likely to have benefited from robust e-commerce growth and strong demand for Hot Wheels.

(Operator Instructions) As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to the SVP of Investor Relations and Industry Affairs, James McDonald. Please go ahead.James R. McDonaldThank you, Leah. Good morning, and welcome to SLB Second Quarter 2023 Earnings Conference Call. Today's call is being hosted from Paris, France following our Board meeting held earlier this week. Joining us on the call are Olivier Le Peuch, Chief Executive Officer; and Stephane Biguet, Chief Financial Officer.Before we begin, I would like to remind all participants that some of the statements we will be making today are forward-looking. These matters involve risks and uncertainties that could cause our results to differ materially from those projected in these statements. I, therefore, refer you to our latest 10-K filing and our other SEC filings. Our comments today may also include non-GAAP financial measures. Additional details and reconciliation to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures can be found in our second quarter press release, which is on our website.With that, I will turn the call over to Olivier.Story continuesOlivier Le PeuchThank you, James. Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for joining us on the call today. In my prepared remarks, I will cover 3 topics. I will first review a few of our financial highlights from the quarter. Next, I will discuss the positive momentum we are seeing in the international and offshore markets. And third, I will share the exciting progress we are making in digital before concluding with our outlook for the third quarter and the full year. Stephane will then provide more details on our financial results, and we will open for your questions.Our second quarter results continue to demonstrate the strength of our portfolio and our strategic positioning in the most attractive, accretive and resilient market globally. This is translating to financial performance and we closed the first half of the year with solid growth across revenue, earnings per share, free cash flow and expanded EBITDA and pretax segment operating margins. International revenue continued its strong growth momentum, increasing 21% year-on-year as we capture broad growth across all divisions and geographic areas. Second quarter revenue increased by more than 20% year-on-year in 14 of our 25 international geounits. Most notably, Saudi Arabia, UAE, Mexico, Guyana, Brazil, Angola, Caspian and India all grew more than 30% over this period. This drove our highest year-on-year international incremental operating margin over the last 3 years, and it underscores the breadth of our portfolio that I continue to emphasize.SLB growth -- SLB global reach shields us from regional fluctuation, as we have recently seen in North America and give us the ability to seize opportunities wherever they arise. This is a true differentiator for our business and positions us for long-term outperformance.Following the remarks I shared in our earnings release this morning, I would like to reflect on a few notable highlights from the quarter. The broad growth characterizing this upcycle continues. Internationally, this was pervasive, and we were very pleased to see all divisions and geography grow revenue and expand margins sequentially. In North America, we continued to increase our revenue, highlighting our agility across the land markets and the expanded activity in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico, solidly outperforming the rig count. Our focus on the quality of our revenue continues to support our margins. Sequentially, we expanded our pretax segment operating margins. This was fueled by our strong international operating leverage, increased technology adoption and positive pricing trends that stem from inflation-driven contract adjustments and tight service capacity.And with higher earnings and improved working capital, our sequential cash flow from operation grew considerably, and we generated free cash flow of nearly $1 billion during the quarter. I want to thank the entire SLB team for their hard work and exceptional performance, delivering value for our customers and our shareholders throughout the quarter. Now let me take a moment to touch on the macro environment. As we have projected for the past few quarters, the international and offshore markets continue to exhibit strong growth as North America has moderated. This is playing to the strength of our business as international revenue represents nearly 80% of our global portfolio and offshore comprises nearly half of that. As the growth rate shifts further towards international, these market conditions are driving the breadth, resilience and durability of this upcycle and creating new opportunities for our business. Let me describe where this is taking place. In the international markets, the investment momentum of the past few years is accelerating. This is supported by resilient long-cycle developments in Guyana, Brazil, Norway and Turkey; production capacity expansion in the Middle East, notably in Saudi Arabia, UAE and Qatar; the return of exploration and appraisal across Africa and the Eastern Mediterranean; and the recognition of gas as a critical fuel source for energy security and the energy transition.In the Middle East, this is resulting in record levels of upstream investment. From 2023 to 2025, Saudi Arabia is expected to allocate nearly $100 billion to upstream oil and gas capital expenditure, a 60% increase compared to the previous 3 years as they invest attain a maximum sustained production capacity of 13 million barrels per day by 2027. Several other country in the region have also announced natural increases in capital expenditure that extend beyond 2025. Furthermore, we continue to witness a broad resurgence in offshore, driven by energy security and rationalization. Operators all over the world are making large-scale commitments to hasten discovery, accelerate development times and increase the productivity of their assets. This is resulting in increased infill and tieback activity in mature basins, new development projects both in oil and gas and support for new exploration. With this backdrop, we anticipate more than $500 billion in global FID between 2022 and 2025, with more than $200 billion attributable to deepwater. This reflects an increase of nearly 90% when compared to 2016-2019. These FID investments are global, taking place in more than 30 countries, and we are seeing the results with new projects in offshore basins across the world. This is reflected in the many contract awards highlighted in the earnings press release, notably in Mexico, Brazil and Turkey. These contracts, in addition to many others, are building a strong foundation of activity outlook decoupled from short-term commodity price volatility. Moving forward, we expect further growth to be led by accelerating activity in Well Construction, new opportunities for Reservoir Performance in exploration and appraisal, expansion for Production Systems in subsea and digital will enhance it all. In our business and the industry as a whole, the increased adoption and integration of digital technologies remains one of the most significant opportunity for growth. Indeed, our industry generates massive amounts of data and by capturing that information and turning it into trusted and actionable insights, we can make energy production more accessible, more affordable and more sustainable. This is a critical moment for our industry, and there are 3 digital trends concurrently shaping its future, clearly setting the path for a higher value, lower carbon outlook. First, the adoption of cloud computing at scale. For geoscience workflows, this is supporting significant productivity gains for geoscientists and engineers across asset development teams. This is happening at a time when our industry is compelled to accelerate the development cycle and derisk both subsurface and surface uncertainties. We continue to benefit from this trend in the adoption of our DELFI cloud-based digital platform, delivered through a flexible and personalized software-as-a-service, SaaS, subscription model, with the cumulative number of users in global customer organization growing 60% year-on-year to 5,400. As we shared in our earnings press release, Petrobras and ENAP are only just 2 example of customers deploying DELFI enterprise-wide with the aim of fundamentally changing how they work across the E&amp;P value chain. Second, our industry is unlocking the power of data at scale. A single well can produce more than 10 terabytes of data per day and this doesn't even begin to touch on the total amount of upstream data across exploration, development and production workflows. The adoption of open data platform across the industry is liberating data for artificial intelligence, AI, applications at large -- at scale. SLB is benefiting from and driving this trend through both data foundation and AI deployment. We are seeing early success with the commercialization of our enterprise data solution powered by Microsoft Energy Data Services. This offering delivers the most comprehensive capabilities for subsurface data in alignment with the emerging requirements of the OSDU technical standard. And we are witnessing tremendous success with our INNOVATION FACTORI, where we have developed more than 100 AI solutions with more than 80 customers since 2021. All of them with rich domain content in addition to generic AI capabilities. Third, digital operation are gaining in maturity, transforming the way operators develop and utilize assets, from automation to autonomous operation across both well construction and production. We are clearly seeing an inflection in the deployment of digital operation with significant impact on efficiency, carbon footprint and performance. Today, customers are accelerating the adoption of our Neuro autonomous solutions, with Kuwait Oil Company and PETRONAS both using these technologies to reduce manual operations while increasing performance, enabling drilling consistency and rig time savings. Similarly, our partnership with Cognite, as a platform for unlocking access to production operations, is gaining momentum in the industry as exemplified with the Cairn contract highlighted in our earnings release. Finally, we continue to deploy DELFI Edge Agora technology to deliver real-time insights directly within operation from connected hardware, where data is generated and process with AI at the edge. We currently have more than 1,400 connected assets deployed, doubling year-on-year. SLB is positioned to fully harness this positive market condition as well as our technology and digital leadership to drive financial outperformance and margin expansion. We are progressing on our journey to double the size of our digital business between 2021 and 2025, and the trend I've just discussed are reinforcing our confidence in the outcome of our strategic execution. I will next describe how we see the rest of the year progressing. After a positive first half, we remain confident in our full year financial ambitions and our visibility into significant baseload of activity that reinforces our 2023 full year forecast and our growth ambition beyond. We continue to expect year-on-year revenue growth of more than 15% and adjusted EBITDA growth in the mid-20s. Turning specifically to the third quarter, we expect revenue to grow by mid-single digits in the international markets with all international geographical area growing sequentially, led by the Middle East and Asia. In contrast, North America revenue will be slightly down. With our focus on the quality of revenue, harnessing operating leverage and further technology adoption, we expect global operating margins to further expand by more than 50 basis points sequentially. This will result into the highest EBITDA margin we have seen in this cycle. I will now turn the call over to Stephane.Stephane BiguetThank you, Olivier, and good morning, ladies and gentlemen. Second quarter earnings per share, excluding charges and credits, was $0.72. This represents an increase of $0.09 sequentially and $0.22 or 44% when compared to the second quarter of last year. We did not record any charges or credits during the current quarter. Overall, our second quarter revenue of $8.1 billion increased 5% sequentially, mostly driven by the international markets, led by the Middle East and Asia. Sequentially, our pretax segment operating margins increased 154 basis points due to the high-quality international revenue, which resulted in strong incremental margins. This performance highlights the underlying earnings potential of our international business, with new technology and high service intensity, particularly offshore, accelerating margin expansion. Company-wide adjusted EBITDA margin for the second quarter was 24.2%. In absolute dollars, adjusted EBITDA increased 28% year-on-year. As a reminder, our ambition is for adjusted EBITDA to grow in percentage terms in the mid-20s for the full year of 2023. On a year-to-date basis, adjusted EBITDA has grown 35% so we are on track to achieve this goal. Second quarter revenue increased 20% year-on-year as international revenue was up 21%, significantly outpacing North America revenue growth of 14%. The strong international growth was led by the Middle East and Asia and robust offshore activity. Pretax segment operating margins expanded 240 basis points year-on-year with significant margin growth in our core divisions. Let me now go through the second quarter results for each division. Second quarter Digital &amp; Integration revenue of $947 million increased 6% sequentially with margins increasing 4 percentage points to 34%. The sequential revenue growth and margin expansion were primarily driven by higher digital sales following the seasonal low of the first quarter. Year-on-year, digital and integration revenue decreased 1%, and margins declined 6 percentage points due to the absence of exceptional exploration data transfer fees we recorded in the second quarter of last year. Growth in other digital products and services was strong, however, including a more than 60% year-on-year revenue increase in our cloud and edge solutions. Reservoir Performance revenue of $1.6 billion increased 9% sequentially, while margins improved 248 basis points to 18.6%. These increases were primarily due to strong growth internationally led by the Middle East and Asia. Year-on-year, revenue grew 23% and margins increased 396 basis points driven by strong growth internationally, both on land and offshore. Well Construction revenue of $3.4 billion increased 3% sequentially, while margins of 21.8% increased 115 basis points, driven by strong measurements, fluids and equipment sales activity as well as pricing improvements internationally. Year-on-year, revenue grew 25%, while margins expanded 424 basis points with very strong growth across all geographical areas on higher activity and improved pricing. Finally, Production Systems revenue of $2.3 billion increased 5% sequentially and margins expanded 274 basis points to 12%, representing the highest margin since the formation of the division. The sequential revenue growth was led by the Middle East and Asia, partially offset by the absence of significant project milestones we reached last quarter in Europe and Africa. Year-on-year, revenue increased 22%, while margins expanded 300 basis points, driven by higher sales of completions and surface production systems and the easing of supply chain and logistic constraints. Now turning to our liquidity. During the quarter, we generated $1.6 billion of cash flow from operations and free cash flow of $986 million. This represents a $1.25 billion increase in free cash flow over the same quarter of last year, which is largely due to improved working capital. We expect this performance to continue throughout the rest of the year. As a result, our free cash flow in the second half of the year will be materially higher than the first half. Our net debt reduced approximately $200 million sequentially to $10.1 billion, which is $900 million lower than the same period last year. Capital investments, inclusive of CapEx and investments in APS projects and exploration data were $622 million in the second quarter. For the full year, we are still expecting capital investments to be approximately $2.5 billion to $2.6 billion. We continued our stock buyback program and repurchased 4.5 million shares during the quarter for a total purchase price of $213 million. We continue to target to return $2 billion to our shareholders this year between dividends and stock buybacks. I will now turn the conference call back to Olivier.Olivier Le PeuchThank you, Stephane. Ladies and gentlemen, I believe we are ready to open the floor to your questions.Question and Answer SessionOperator(Operator Instructions) Our first question will come from the line of James West with Evercore ISI.James Carlyle WestSo Olivier, we've -- especially, you and I and Stephane have spent a lot of time together in the last 18 months. Let's -- if we go back to Luzern and then to the Analyst Day in New York City and recent events. We've become increasingly, I think all 3 of us, bullish on the cycle and the cycle's duration especially. I wonder if you could comment on the duration aspect you see now as you travel around the world, you meet with your customers, you're talking to your customers, what are they saying about their drilling programs over the next several years? You obviously made some pretty bullish comments around Saudi, but more broadly with your major customers, what are their expectations? And how are they thinking about duration of their upstream spending cycle?Olivier Le PeuchNo, very good question, James. I think you may have realized that recently, we characterized the cycle as breadth, resilience and durability, and let me comment a little bit further on durability and there are 2 or 3 elements to this. I think, obviously, we did comment on the return of offshore where the first year to flag it and to call for the return of offshore. And I think we have seen this international offshore resurgence materializing in the last 12 months and accelerating. And in the second half, actually, the offshore rig count will be higher than the land rig count increase. So this momentum is driven by the economics of offshore assets where the FID now, the vast majority of the FID are below $50 and favorably positioned for FID.Also the geologic and the low carbon nature of most of the assets. Accessibility, it is resource and is both oil and gas. So offshore is having a resurgence that is translating into a very significant pipeline of FID, and we see it across not only the IOCs and independent that are capturing this opportunity, but also the NOC that have placed a bet on offshore, as you can see from Brazil to Middle East or the North Sea. So we see this happening at scale. We see also the emergence, sort of the second leg of FID and future offshore expansion driven by exploration appraisal. Exploration appraisal is happening in many countries. There are many rounds of -- licensing rounds happening, a lot of exploration and appraisal is happening to find this next reserve and develop. So offshore is there to stay and not only in '24 or '25, but beyond as we can see, and with the second leg materializing. Beyond that, obviously, Middle East has made a significant commitment of capacity expansion, both in oil of 4 million barrels or so and in gas for regional consumption, displacing all for energy or for generating some blue ammonia -- or blue halogen products as well as further expanding their energy export in Qatar, particularly. So the Middle East capacity expansion is leading to, as we have been quoting, record level of investment from this year onward, and is not set to again stop in '24 as the vast majority of this capital expansion are towards the second half of the decade 2027 or 2030 for some of the target. So what we have seen lately and the feedback to the visits we have had is that the duration of the cycle as we were characterizing a year ago is actually extending and is to be believed, prolonging to the right, and with a combination of offshore resurgence being very solid and Middle East being capacity expansion beyond the next 3 years.James Carlyle WestOkay. Okay. That makes a lot of sense. And then the -- maybe a follow-up. As we think about -- or as you think about, I guess, revenue quality as we go through this, what looks to be and appears to be, and I think we agree on, a long duration cycle, you can upgrade your revenue quality either by choosing offshore over onshore or customers by customer. How are you thinking about that quality of the revenue base that you put in place now? And what are the main kind of drivers of that? I'm assuming it's -- you're looking for the highest return and highest margin, but what are the key metrics or key assumptions you have there?Olivier Le PeuchNo, absolutely. I think we have been initiating the returns-focused strategy a few years back. And I think we are getting the character sort of cycle of this, favoring and accelerating our strategy as we get the opportunity to not only get a favorable mix that included a bit more offshore Middle East exploration appraisal but also higher technology adoption, including digital, including fit technology or including transition technology, all combining to give a premium to the -- and a higher revenue quality. But I will not forget also the capital discipline that we have initiated as part of this strategy that is pushing us to high guide to the higher returns, higher margins contract as we move forward, and make sure that we get the best return for the capital we deployed and also to put a clear threshold on capital investment and capital strategy going forward. So the combination, as I said, of the favorable mix, the technology adoption at scale with some secular trends in digital and the capital discipline that we have used to execute our strategy are allowing us to create the revenue quality improvement and the high grading on every portfolio and every business line we have to drive margin expansion. And we have seen margin expansion increasing, and we will continue to pursue this as we move forward.OperatorOur next question is from David Anderson with Barclays.J. David AndersonSo I was curious on the Middle East-Asia. It showed really impressive sequential growth during the quarter. I was wondering if you could talk a bit about what drove that. Was that just a reflection of the steady ramp-up of projects in Saudi and other Middle East markets? And also, you mentioned a directional drilling contract in the release. Was that a discrete contract? And are you starting to see higher pricing on those types of contracts now?Olivier Le PeuchWell, I think to be -- to stay very -- it's a very broad term, I think, it's Middle East and Asia, and there are several geo units, as we call them, that have been benefiting from very significant growth sequential and year-on-year. As we commented, many of them are in the 30% basket -- more than 30% basket growth year-on-year in that region, that area. But indeed, in the GCC and the Middle East, particularly, we are benefiting again, we say, from 3 things. We are benefiting from the capacity expansion program that have been initiated, that have turned into an inflection into reactivity and spend activity that you benefit from, considering our market exposure. We have been renewing several contract and either encroaching or gaining market and strengthening our market position. And you have seen several announcements made. And this includes service capacity, service expansion contract more than, I would say, integrated contract. And finally, we have been benefiting from -- based on our performance from, I would say, pricing increments based on performance that have all combined service contract expansion, reactivity increase and pricing, all combining to result into an incremental revenue year-on-year and sequentially that we believe will be on the continuum for the rest of the year.J. David AndersonOkay. And if I could shift over to the D&amp;I segment. Could you provide some color on the non-APS businesses and how they've been trending? I'm particularly interested in the digital solutions business and kind of really what you're seeing in terms of digital adoption of your customers. I'm really not sure if you can provide any metrics or any examples, but just kind of curious how -- kind of how some of your customers are using it kind of this year versus a year ago, like is there any way to kind of show us kind of -- or kind of explain to us kind of how that digital adoption is trending?Olivier Le PeuchYes. I think as we keep saying, I think some of the digital success and digital business growth we are having today is a bit masked in our financial reporting results by the flat or declining EPS year-on-year that we have. So I think you have to look at it first on the financial overall result of this division. Secondly, I would say that as I described in my prepared remarks that there are 3 trends that we are capturing and that we are exposed to that are happening in the industry, all of them under the secular trend of digital transformation in this industry, one on cloud computing, making the best out of cloud computing, scalable computing and elastic competing access that cloud solutions such as DELFI gives, and hence, accelerating productivity of the asset team from exploration to asset development. We are seeing it. You have seen the announcement of the Petrobras award that is square into that category of using cloud capability to accelerate and enable productivity in the geoscience team and quality of results for the asset development team. So that's one sector that -- and again, we measure it by either number of customers' expansion or adoption of users, which we have seen are quoted in my prepared remark at 60% growth year-on-year. The second aspect is unlocking data, the vast amount of data that our industry manipulates, stores, manage and structured data, unstructured data to try to unlock this and democratize, if you like, AI. So we are fortunate to have a cloud-based solution, DELFI, that has AI domain capability embedded into it. We use it every day to help our customer unlock and get access to this AI capability. We have done it through INNOVATION FACTORI, 100 solutions deployed. So that's the second engine of digital growth, if you like, is the data structure, data transformation and AI capability. And that's again, we are speaking about growing at above 50% for that subsegment of our digital offering. And last and maybe the one that has the most growth potential that is untapped across the industry, digital operation. That's everywhere from well construction to producing assets. And that's why we deploy either some element of our cloud offering in drilling automation or in surveillance of assets or we deploy at the edge, on the asset, at the pump some device, and we call it the Agora edge solution, which have embedded AI at the edge that do not need to run trip to the cloud to optimize these assets and give -- and we use it and consume it in our APS assets to enhance the performance. So we are seeing the benefit of all these. At the same time, they're all growing at a different pace, different adoption across the NOC, the independent -- all the IOCs. And it will be a long tail of growth that will clearly have long durability and we continue to be a factor of secular trend in our industry to extract efficiency, low carbon productivity using this trend. So that's what we see, multiple engine of growth across multiple horizon, and with different technology where we have leadership in most and a footprint that allows us to tap into 1,500 customers for the long run.OperatorWe will go ahead and move on to the line of Arun Jayaram with JPMorgan Chase.Arun JayaramMy first question is on offshore. You've highlighted how 85% of global offshore FIDs are now underpinned by oil prices at $50 or below which is quite a bit below what we saw in the prior cycle where we thought that you needed, call it, mid-60s oil price to kind of justify offshore developments, particularly deepwater. I was wondering if you can give some thoughts on what is driving, call it, the lower breakevens than we saw prior cycle?Olivier Le PeuchI would think -- there are several aspects to that. One obviously is the progress the industry at large has made in efficiency, integration, technology, performance at large that is getting the curve shifting to the left on drilling the cycle compressing on subsea and the overall development cycle to be more derisked to digital. So technology, integration, performance at large has helped the operator and the service industry to deliver faster and to deliver the lower total cost, the development of those assets. The second element, I would think that exploration has been creating a portfolio of assets that can then been high-graded. And then the quality of the resource, the high quality of the geological play and lower carbon and better place that have a better production and recovery potential, have also emerged and have been more favorably primed and/or, I would say, prioritized by our customers. So these customers have choice and they focus on the best and the most advantageous assets and the most advantaged geological basins that have -- we have seen it from Brazil to Guyana, and we are seeing it in the Middle East for some of the gas assets as well. So the third, I think, dimension that is, I think, accelerating in our opinion is what is called infrastructure-led development or infrastructure-led exploration and development, which make the returns on incremental oil, incremental gas from existing hubs, from existing platform, lower cost than in the past because the capability to infill tieback and expand from an existing platform, getting a better return on existing infrastructure. Hence, we have seen a significant improvement and have seen an increase investment into this infill and tieback, and ILX as this is called, infrastructure-led development, infrastructure-led exploration, and that's -- this is another trend that is lowering the average cost of FID for increment of oil pool or additional gas. So you combine all of this and you are getting better economics, hence, better and sustained and higher durability for the long-term offshore play.Arun JayaramGreat. And just a follow-up. Olivier, we've been getting a few buy-side questions on the update on your website regarding Russia. I was wondering if you could just expand on what this means on a go-forward basis for SLB?Olivier Le PeuchSimply said, I think Russia revenue represented approximately 5% of our consolidated revenue in the second quarter and the decision that we have made last Friday to halt remaining shipment to Russia from all SLB facility will not impact our financial gains. So this decision will extend what you have seen as our previous ban on shipments from the location that we had in the United States, the U.K., Canada into Russia, and we will continue to ensure that our remaining presence in Russia meets and exceeds all international sanctions.OperatorAnd I apologize, we will go back to the line of Scott Gruber with Citigroup.Scott Andrew GruberD&amp;I margins snapped back nicely in 2Q. And in the past, you've talked about D&amp;I as a mid-30s type margin business, at least near term. But in terms of thinking about the second half, can you build off that 34%? Should we expect those to grind higher in 3Q and 4Q? And then more importantly, as we think about 2024 and given all the digital growth, you think D&amp;I margins could push into the high 30s, especially with hopefully some of the APS headwinds abating?Stephane BiguetScott, Stephane here. So yes, you've seen the D&amp;I margins returning to levels we like, in the mid-30s after the Q1 seasonal low. And just for clarification, this is almost entirely coming from digital because APS ended up somehow unexpectedly flat in terms of revenue. So really the entire margin expansion from Q1 to Q2 is digital, which is good news. So can it go up higher than 34%? Yes, potentially. You always have -- you can have certain sales like exploration, data, et cetera, but the mid-30s is a good goal post for us with a few percentages up and down depending on exceptional sales.Scott Andrew GruberAnd we should still think about that in '24 as well?Olivier Le PeuchYes. Through '24 and the trajectory we see in digital is not set to slow down because I think as I explained, multiple dimension and trends are concurrently shaping the future of our digital success, and I think we expect it to continue well into the -- beyond the cycle, as we call it, actually, and the accretive, I would say, contribution of digital will, over time, long term, be more and more accretive on the growth and more and more accretive on the margins.Scott Andrew GruberGot it. And then just a quick one on North America. Pretty impressive performance in 2Q with revenues up in the rig count, in contrast to the rig count being down. Obviously, Gulf of Mexico is helping you guys. Are you also seeing continued growth in that fit-for-basin strategy? And then -- go ahead.Olivier Le PeuchAbsolutely. I think that's what we call our agility and fit strategy in the -- and the land part of the North America has been helping to shield ourselves on some of the macro trends. I think we believe that the lack of exposure to pressure pumping at scale and the fit-for-basin technology strategy, partly in well construction has allowed us to continue to progress or to buffer some other activity decline and expose us to actually the mix of performance that has been resilient in North America land and then complemented -- augmented, if I may, by the North America offshore, where we have seen activity and revenue progression.OperatorNext, we go to the line of Kurt Hallead with Benchmark.Kurt Kevin HalleadSo you guys put up a really impressive free cash flow number in the quarter. You indicated that free cash flow dynamics would obviously improve in the second half of the year. So I'm just kind of curious, though, close to $1 billion of free cash flow in the quarter itself. Is this the dynamic now where you can continue to harvest that kind of cash? And is that level of free cash flow is something that you think could be sustainable as you go into the third and fourth quarter of this year?Stephane BiguetSo look, yes, we are also quite pleased with the free cash flow performance in the second quarter. It's -- as I said, it's mostly improved working capital on top of the earnings, of course. And as you know, there is quite some seasonality in our cash flow and working capital. So we came out of a seasonally low Q1 with quite a strong Q2. We again beat a quarterly record on DSO for our second quarter, and our inventory efficiency improved quite a bit as well. So it sets us quite well for the rest of the year. As you said, we always generate quite more cash in the second half. So the $1 billion level is a good starting point for Q3, Q4, and we'll take it from there. But we are slightly ahead of where we wanted to be, and I think we can continue that way for the second half.Kurt Kevin HalleadGot it. That's great. That's fantastic. And my follow-up. So Olivier, a lot of contract awards during the quarter. You discussed the emphasis on long-term visibility on a number of these projects. It's easy for us on the outside to kind of look at what goes on with an offshore driller and look at their contract start date sometime in the future. Maybe a little bit more challenging to kind of connect those dots to how a service company and at what point in time does a service company get slotted in for those projects.So I was just wondering, for the benefit of everybody on the call and understanding where your visibility is coming from, at what point in time do you guys think that Schlumberger get called into an offshore drilling project, for example? And what gives you the conviction and how can you convey that conviction to the investor base and understanding that this cycle really does -- is different and has longer legs than what we may have seen in the past?Olivier Le PeuchNo, I think it's a mix. It's a mix of -- I think we -- and you have seen many contracts, some of them have very long duration, more than 5 years or 7 years in recent award that we highlighted in April and this July. And I think 3 to 5 years is a typical contract terms that we have. Every contract you see, a framework contract that are being used to mobilize resource and to commit capacity across multiple years, and this contract either start this year or start next year. Hence, they go well beyond 2025 and support the thesis of durability duration beyond mid this decade. And secondly, I would say that you see also that we were announcing a few of the subsea award, and we'll continue to see that in the second half. We quoted our total booking for Production Systems, which is the long cycle side of our business. So you have the contract I was referring to, service contract, 3, 5, 7 years, and many of them in Middle East and/or offshore, as you have seen. And then you have the bookings that then -- bookings that are then supporting 2 or 3 years of delivery, be it in subsea or be it in some of the large surface contract that you have seen in Qatar subsea, as you have seen in different parts of the Americas and -- or Turkey. And this is typically 2 or 3 years out of booking, and we have been quoting $10 billion to $12 billion for the full year on Production Systems, and we are confident this represent 1.1 to 1.3 book-to-bill ratio. And this -- as we will exit 2023, we'll have this booking to fuel at least 2 years of growth going forward in our long-cycle business. So you combine these and you get many of the elements of duration on international, Middle East and offshore markets.OperatorOur next question will come from Neil Mehta with Goldman Sachs.Neil Singhvi MehtaThe first question is just around more around Production Systems. Margins were really good there. So can you talk about how we should think about the margin trajectory? And also tie that into any commentary you have around the subsea, which has been a source of momentum.Olivier Le PeuchYes. I think Production Systems is, as I said, is an equipment, mostly product equipment and long cycle and -- on which we had suffered from some supply logistics constraints last year that we flagged, and we said at the [onset] as soon as this constraint will be behind us, we'll feel comfortable that the momentum on margin expansion will be matching what we have seen in the other core division that we have and this is starting to materialize. Our ambition is not stopping at this margin. Our long-term ambition is to continue to grow and expand in line with the overall core division as we believe that operating efficiency, including into this long cycle manufacturing efficiency, and the pricing environment for this unique technology we have from subsea to surface from completion to [actual list] of some process equipment that we are deploying across some offshore FPSO. All of this combine to give us the, I would say, the confidence that this trajectory of margin expansion will not stop here and will continue to grow. You have heard about the booking, I was commenting on this. It's a booking and margin expansion journey for PS going forward.Neil Singhvi MehtaAnd Olivier, when we saw each other a couple of weeks ago, you had just spent a lot of time on the road visiting a lot of customers in different regions. Wonder if you can just kind of go around the world and talk about customer conversations, obviously, name agnostic, and what are you seeing in terms of different basins in terms of activity?Olivier Le PeuchI don't want to be too specific, obviously. I think I will reflect more on the general sentiment. I think the general sentiment is that first and foremost, energy security and capacity expansion still dominate the decision and the economics are seen as very favorable and the outlook of the industry at large is seen as resilient and you have seen it for many major, reaffirming their 2030 production volume and adjusting their strategy to make sure they maximize the opportunity to either accelerate their gas transition or sustain their oil production. And this will mean investment, and we see that in all the engagement we have. And then the NOC is [beating] in the Americas, in Africa, Middle East or Asia, pursuing the 2 things, either their production enhancement to make sure they continue to lift their production performance, and then addressing security -- energy security through their gas development, typically. We see this everywhere, partly in Asia. So the customers are fairly focused on developing their gas assets, expanding and/or reverting some of the trends of declining oil production and to make sure they maximize the cycle, their participation to the cycle and their participation to the international pool -- supply pool that is happening. So it's broad. And as I commented during our time together, I think I commented that we are seeing also many newcomers that are expanding into deepwater, into exploration rounds that are across the globe in new territories or in new countries, and this will attract more investment. This will attract, if the geology are right, future FID. So it's, in general, driven by energy security, pool international supply and IOC's commitment to sustain their position towards the end of the decade.OperatorAnd next, we go to a question from Luke Lemoine.Luke Michael LemoineOlivier, you're pressed to award with a 5-year contract with Petrobras for DELFI deployment across the organization, seeing if you can maybe talk about the opportunity for additional contracts with other NOCs or majors for enterprise-wide DELFI and kind of the level of interest there.Olivier Le PeuchYes. We typically do not speak ahead of any public announcements, the work we are doing on the ground to continue to prepare for further penetration of our existing customers. But yes, there are fairly advanced discussion with several customers to prepare for a transition and adoption of DELFI cloud solution, either for their geoscience workflow or for some of the drilling operation as I was referring to or for some of the adoption of AI and unlocking that data. So we are seeing this. And yes, you will see -- you continue to see every quarter a new announcement that will come in the different, the 3 different dimension and trends that I was highlighting. And you will see large contract in the future, hopefully, materializing as well that we replicate the success we had with Chevron, who was the first very large enterprise deployment that many company are looking to towards and using to reflect some of their future opportunity they have with us. So that's happening at scale and we are pleased with progress. But again, it's a long journey and it's 1 customer at a time, and it will take years and the cycle will be long and will be accretive for the long run.OperatorAnd our next question is from Keith MacKey with RBC Capital Markets.Keith MacKeyJust wanted to first ask on the subsea JV with Subsea 7 and Aker originally expected to close at the end of next month. Can you just remind us of the key benefits of that transaction? Maybe give us an update on where you are in relation to closing. And if you expect any impact to the numbers or the way you might report the numbers in the Production Systems segment going forward, would be helpful.Olivier Le PeuchYes. First, I think we -- what we quoted at the time we announced the JV is that we expected this to close by Q3 this year, which is in 2 months from now. The progress we have made is that we have progressed towards obtaining the majority of the antitrust regulatory approval to move forward. We have progress in our planning in conjunction with our future partners and we'll be communicating on this as soon as we can to give you the materiality and the timing and the materiality of this as we will consolidate. Now it will be consolidated into the PS and into the revenue going forward at the time we will announce the closing, and we will give you the detailed information about that when it will be announced, and we'll give clarity on the way we will report it.So good progress across the different jurisdiction and good progress, very good progress on the planning to prepare for the closing as well. So we're optimistic towards the near future.Keith MacKeyAnd one final question for Stephane, just on the buyback. As free cash flow is set to increase in the second half of the year, should we expect any significant deviation from the $200 million-or-so run rate you've set for the first half of the year? Or is that still a good number to put in our models?Stephane BiguetLook, the way you have to look at it, Keith, is really on our commitment to return a total of $2 billion to shareholders and it's between dividends and buybacks. So, yes, if you do the math, you will get the average level of buyback in the second quarter -- or in the second half, sorry. But yes, it will continue, of course.OperatorAnd ladies and gentlemen, that is all the time we have for questions. I will now turn the conference back to the SLB leadership for closing comments.Olivier Le PeuchThank you, Leah. Ladies and gentlemen, as we conclude today's call, I would like to leave you with the following takeaways. First, as our second quarter results clearly demonstrate our market position, performance differentiation and technology leadership are fit for the cycle, and we continue to drive our financial performance. Second, as upstream investments accelerate in the international and offshore markets, these regions will lead our growth and lay a strong foundation for ongoing outperformance in the years ahead. Third, following a solid first half and with significant visibility into the second half of the year, we have affirmed our confidence in our full year financial targets.This is a compelling environment for our company. And today, we have more returns focused, disciplined and efficient than ever before. We could not ask for a better backdrop to execute our commitment to shareholder returns. I remain very confident in our strategy and fully trust the SLB team to continue delivering strong performance for our business. With this, I will conclude today's call. Thank you all for joining.OperatorLadies and gentlemen, that does conclude your conference for today. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.]"

This compares to earnings of $0.50 per share a year ago. These figures are adjusted for non-recurring items.This quarterly report represents an earnings surprise of 1.41%.

This compares to year-ago revenues of $6.77 billion.

Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried-and-tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank, which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions.Story continuesAhead of this earnings release, the estimate revisions trend for Schlumberger: mixed. While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company's just-released earnings report, the current status translates into a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for the stock.

This makes the dividend yield 3.8%, which will augment investor returns quite nicely. See our latest analysis for Northern Trust Northern Trust's Payment Expected To Have Solid Earnings CoverageA big dividend yield for a few years doesn't mean much if it can't be sustained.Northern Trust has established itself as a dividend paying company with over 10 years history of distributing earnings to shareholders. Past distributions do not necessarily guarantee future ones, but Northern Trust's payout ratio of 54% is a good sign as this means that earnings decently cover dividends.The next 3 years are set to see EPS grow by 41.3%. The future payout ratio could be 41% over that time period, according to analyst estimates, which is a good look for the future of the dividend.historic-dividendNorthern Trust Has A Solid Track RecordEven over a long history of paying dividends, the company's distributions have been remarkably stable. Since 2013, the annual payment back then was $1.20, compared to the most recent full-year payment of $3.00. This implies that the company grew its distributions at a yearly rate of about 9.6% over that duration. The dividend has been growing very nicely for a number of years, and has given its shareholders some nice income in their portfolios.The Dividend's Growth Prospects Are LimitedInvestors who have held shares in the company for the past few years will be happy with the dividend income they have received. Unfortunately things aren't as good as they seem. Northern Trust hasn't seen much change in its earnings per share over the last five years.In SummaryOverall, we think Northern Trust is a solid choice as a dividend stock, even though the dividend wasn't raised this year. With shrinking earnings, the company may see some issues maintaining the dividend even though they look pretty sustainable for now. The payment isn't stellar, but it could make a decent addition to a dividend portfolio.Story continuesMarket movements attest to how highly valued a consistent dividend policy is compared to one which is more unpredictable. However, there are other things to consider for investors when analysing stock performance. Without at least some growth in earnings per share over time, the dividend will eventually come under pressure either from competition or inflation.

108,b0058c4e-767b-372c-a742-a170f661ced1,HOLX,2023-07-22,Hologic (HOLX) to Report Q3 Earnings: What's in the Cards?,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/hologic-holx-report-q3-earnings-163000292.html,1689957000,STORY,"['HOLX', 'TGTX']","[Hologic, Inc. HOLX is slated to report third-quarter fiscal 2023 results on July 31, after the closing bell.In the last reported quarter, the company’s earnings of $1.06 per share surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 20.5%. Its earnings surpassed the consensus estimate in each of the trailing four quarters, the average surprise being 27.32%.Let’s see how things have shaped up prior to the announcement.Factors at PlayDiagnosticsIn third-quarter fiscal 2023, Hologic is expected to have witnessed growth in the Diagnostics business (excluding COVID) from the growing adoption of Panther instruments and an expanded Panther installed base. The company’s expanded global installed base of more than 3,250 Panthers represents the catalyst for the division's sustained growth. The superior workflow of Panther combined with a broad menu of nearly 20 FDA-approved assays across Panther and Panther Fusion systems, creates tremendous value for customers and differentiates it from competitors. We believe these growth catalysts to have driven the company’s performance in Q3.Molecular Diagnostics is likely to have registered strong growth in the third quarter, driven by Aptima BV and CV/TV vaginitis panel and aided by the core STI menu, including Clemidiagonrhia, HPV and Trich. In May 2023, Hologic received the FDA 510(k) clearance for the company’s Panther Fusion SARS-CoV-2/Flu A/B/RSV assay. We believe this development to have contributed to the company’s fiscal third-quarter performance.Similar to the last reported quarter, Diagnostics business is expected to decline globally compared with the prior year’s levels due to significantly lower COVID testing.Per our model, Hologic’s Diagnostic’s business revenues are projected at $501 million in Q3, a 10.5% decline year over year.Breast HealthIn the past few quarters, semiconductor chip availability continues to improve, allowing the delivery of more gantries than planned. Further, exceptional demand for the clinically differentiated mammography instruments remains high. We believe these trends to have continued in the fiscal third quarter as well.Hologic’s strong backlog, the launch of new software products based on its investments in artificial intelligence and strength in its disposable portfolio such as Brevera, biopsy needles and Somatex Tumark markers are expected to have boosted HOLX’s revenues in the to-be-reported quarter.Story continuesHologic, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise Hologic, Inc. Price and EPS SurpriseHologic, Inc. price-eps-surprise | Hologic, Inc. Quote Per our model, Hologic’s Breast Health’s business revenues are projected at $294.9 million for the fiscal third quarter, up 4.3% year over year.GYN SurgicalSimilar to the last reported quarter, Hologic’s GYN Surgical is expected to have registered strong contributions from hysteroscopic portfolio of MyoSure the Fluent fluid management system and NovaSure. Through Acessa and Bolder aquisitions, the company integrated Acessa’s procedure and the Bolder’s advanced vessel sealing portfolio in its product line. Acessa is a unique radio frequency fibroid removal solution forming a new market. With Boulder, the company is entering an underdeveloped market by deploying its large surgical sales force. We believe these strategic efforts to have contributed to the company’s top line in the fiscal third quarter.However, we note that, similar to industry-wide trends, Hologic’s surgical business is likely to have impacted by staffing shortages, which reduced hospital capacity, and choppy market conditions due to persistent foreign exchange impact are concerns. Moreover, Hologic’s mammography, related products and subsystems compete on a worldwide basis with products offered by a number of competitors which is expected to have impacted company’s sales in the quarter to be reported.Per our model, Hologic’s GYN Surgical’s business revenues are projected at $132.6 million in the said quarter, suggesting a 4% decline year over year.The Estimate PictureThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for total fiscal third-quarter revenues of $956.5 million suggests a decline of 4.6% from the prior-year quarter’s figure.The consensus estimate for earnings per share is pegged at 88 cents, indicating a decline of 7.4% from the year-ago reported figure.What Our Model SuggestsOur proven model does not conclusively predict an earnings beat for Hologic this time around. The combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) increases the odds of an earnings beat.

If you want to see more stocks in this selection, check out 5 Under-the-Radar Stocks That Are on The Move.Valuations in the US equity market appear overstretched in the aftermath of stocks registering one of the best runs in the first six months of the year. Consequently, the race for stocks likely to deliver better-than-expected gains heading into yearend is heating up. The likes of Visa Inc. (NYSE:V) and Mastercard Incorporated (NYSE:MA) are increasingly emerging as some of the best plays as they show signs of breaking out after rallying to 52-week highs.The impressive run in the market depicted by the S&amp;P 500 rallying by more than 19%, Nasdaq by more than 30% year to date has been fueled by stocks that enjoy mass support. In addition, the stocks behind the rally are mostly of companies with unique elements of reliability and predictability. Unknown to most people is that under-the-radar stocks on the move could deliver better-than-expected gains because of their lack of predictability.It's common for investors to get hung up on big boys like Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) as they receive the biggest share of Wall Street attention. Therefore, their stock prices tend to react instantly, even on the smallest news.However, if you do not have an informational edge over other investors, generating value from the stocks might be difficult. Additionally, the initial investment capital in some of the stocks is usually high as some trade at a premium.To compensate for this mishap, it is common for investors to seek haven in under-the-radar stocks that are often not given the much-needed attention. While some are in less known industries, some are of smaller companies with solid, long-term prospects.While investing in under-the-radar stocks, having a long-term mindset to safeguard one's holdings from temporary headwinds is better. Additionally, such stocks offer a great way of diversifying an investment portfolio.Story continuesInvesting in under the radar stocks offers a great opportunity to invest in companies before they become household names. The investment can pay off on getting in early before the heard joins and fuels a significant move to the upside.The best under-the-radar stocks are mostly companies with a competitive edge, be it in the financial sector, tech, all even the industrial sector. For instance, some stocks were able to navigate the banking crisis early in the year to generate significant returns. On the other hand, stocks are well poised to do, even with the US economy's recession.12 Under-the-Radar Stocks That Are on The MoveSource: UnsplashAccording to CIC Wealth Executive Vice President Malcolm Ethridge, Mastercard and Visa are some of the stocks that sit well in the financial sector as they handle almost every credit card transaction in the US. While the focus has been on JPMorgan, especially on delivering better-than-expected Q2 results, Malcolm believes the two-payment processing company boasts a recession-proof model as they are embedded in every transaction worldwide.While investing in any stock, it's vital to look beyond the company's share price at that moment. The focus should always be on the underlying business at hand and its long-term prospects. Therefore, there might be better under-the-radar stock than the best under-the-radar stock. Instead, it is of companies with strong leadership, competitive advantage in their respective industries, strong financials, and solid paths to future growth.Our MethodologyWe used Finviz's stock screener to select the 12 under-the-radar stocks. We chose the stocks that are near their 52-week highs and have Upside Potential. These companies have strong potential and performance and can be great investment opportunities.

(NASDAQ:NFLX) Q2 2023 Earnings Call Transcript July 19, 2023Netflix, Inc. beats earnings expectations. Reported EPS is $3.29, expectations were $2.84.Spencer Wang: Hello, and welcome to the Netflix Q2 2023 Earnings Interview. I'm Spencer Wang, VP of Finance, IR and Corporate Development. Joining me today are Co-CEOs, Ted Sarandos; and Greg Peters; and CFO, Spence Neumann. Our interviewer this quarter is Jessica Reif Ehrlich from Bank of America. As a reminder, we'll be making forward-looking statements and actual results may vary. Jessica, I'll now turn over the call to you for your first question.Q - Jessica Reif Ehrlich: Thank you. Well, let's start with the top of [indiscernible] not one, but two strikes. Can you give us your views of how this affects your business on a practical basis? How far out does your original content take you and how much of the content spend do you think gets pushed from '23 -- from this year into next year?Ted Sarandos: Thanks, Jessica. Good afternoon. Thanks for the questions. Let me start by making something absolutely clear. These strikes, this strike is not an outcome that we wanted. We make deals all the time. We are constantly at the table negotiating with writers, with directors, with actors and producers with everyone across the industry and we very much hoped to reach an agreement by now. So I also want to say, if I may, on a personal level, I was raised in a union household. My dad was a member of IBEW Local 640 as a local -- he was a union electrician. And I remember his local because that union was very much a part of our lives when I was growing up. And I also remember on more than one occasion, my dad being out on strike.netflixPhoto by Souvik Banerjee on UnsplashAnd I remember that because it takes an enormous pole on your family financially and emotionally. So you should know that nobody here, nobody within ANPTP and I'm sure nobody had SAG or nobody at the WGA took any of this lightly. But we've got a lot of work to do. There are a handful of complicated issues. We're super committed to getting to an agreement as soon as possible. One that's equitable and one that enables the industry and everybody in it to move forward into the future.Story continuesJessica Reif Ehrlich: And in terms of content, how much original content -- do you have to run out, like at a certain point in time, you probably will.Ted Sarandos: Well, look, we've put some of our upcoming content in the letter. We've said in the last call, we produced heavily across all kinds of content TV, film, unscripted, scripted, the local domestic, English, non-English, all those things and they're all true. But as besides the point, the real point is we need to get to this strike to a conclusion so that we can all move forward.See also 30 Cities with the Highest Altitudes in the World and 20 Most Efficient Countries in the World.To continue reading the Q&amp;A session, please click here.]"

Investors are concerned that price cuts are starting to eat into Tesla's margins. Netflix, meanwhile, reported revenue that was a little lighter than had been expected.Video TranscriptSEANA SMITH: Let's also talk about two big earnings results that we got here just within the last couple of days, Netflix and Tesla. When it comes to these two names, the bar was set pretty high. We've seen a massive run up in these stocks. Tesla beating on both the top and bottom line. Pressure on margins. The price cuts that we've been talking about, that clearly was one of the issues for investors.When it comes to Netflix, a miss on revenue, also their guidance coming up, a bit light for the third quarter for sales. That was a huge issue. And we saw that reflected not so much in today's trading action, but the big drops that we saw in both Tesla and Netflix yesterday.MYLES UDLAND: You know, and we discussed both of these names earlier in the day. And I think conversation got a little sideways there. But one thing that stood out to me with Netflix was that they discussed so openly, that their new-- their main driver of revenue is converting people who already watch Netflix, but just don't pay him any money, which is a fine story. And they are certainly committed to it.And you can see Netflix really starting to turn the gears of what we captured the market and now we will make everyone pay more for it. But I think on the margins with a name that's up 50% this year, with a name that has a lot of hype behind it and is still working off as we can see in this chart, some excesses that we saw in that 2021, 2022 period, there's still maybe a sense of is that it?So that's the whole thing. You're just going to monetize people who don't pay you yet. Like, is there no more growth. And maybe Netflix is the first one to admit that everybody got Netflix.Story continuesSEANA SMITH: Yeah.MYLES UDLAND: They just don't pay me for it. There's no person who hasn't heard of Netflix.SEANA SMITH: No, there's no person who hasn't heard of Netflix. But the growth opportunity overseas obviously is a very different story than what we've seen play out within the US. But when you talk about--MYLES UDLAND: Show me the RPU, not as good.SEANA SMITH: Well, exactly. And that's what I was going to get to. Just in terms of future adoption here when it comes to that ad-based business, I think a lot of that base that they would have captured at least here in the US, obviously their largest market. You would think that most of those people have already converted. So-- and you've got to ask how many more does that mean that are going to be forced off-- do you share a Netflix? What's that looking like?MYLES UDLAND: I was going to ask you. I actually I am the payor and my parents are mooching off of me.SEANA SMITH: Wow.MYLES UDLAND: I know.SEANA SMITH: Look at you.MYLES UDLAND: Very big of me. Do you guys-- do you guys pay?SEANA SMITH: Well, you know-- yeah, we pay our own.MYLES UDLAND: You pay for it, right?SEANA SMITH: We pay our own.MYLES UDLAND: How's the kids behaving on Netflix?SEANA SMITH: No one will need to know, though.MYLES UDLAND: Is it with Disney Plus, with YouTube? What are we doing?SEANA SMITH: We Disney Plus. We YouTube. We do Hulu. And we pay for all of those ourselves, which you could argue is probably not the best financial decision there. But they're all necessary, at least when you have young kids.]"

If you want to see more stocks in this selection, check out 5 Cheap Travel Stocks to Buy Now.Revenge travel is the new phenomenon as travelers try to compensate for the lost time and opportunity over the last two years due COVID-19 restrictions. Opening of borders and easing of restrictions even in China is the catalyst behind the 11% annual online travel market growth rate. The segment has seen a spike in tourists searching and booking various travel services, including hotel and Airbnb accommodations, flights, cars, tours, and cruises.Booking Holdings Inc. (NASDAQ:BKNG) is one of the companies benefiting from the surge in airline demand, with its stock up by about 40% year to date. Tripadvisor Inc. (NASDAQ:TRIP) and Expedia Group Inc. (NASDAQ:EXPE) are other stocks flying high as more people worldwide make travel arrangements to try and make up for the lost time following the Covid 19 pandemic. The companies are benefiting from a rebound in travel to urban centers, with some of the biggest cities in the world experiencing a significant uptick in tourists.Solo trips were a thing at the height of the pandemic due to the need for minimal interaction to avert contracting or spreading the virus. Nevertheless, solo trips hurt the travel industry due to reduced revenues. Fast forward, there is a significant decrease in solo trips, with people opting to travel in large packs, which benefits most companies in the segment.Even though most Americans are fearful that the economic situation will worsen and therefore cut back on expenditure, there was a 47% increase in people traveling in the U.S. compared to the second quarter of last year. Despite the cautious sentiment around finances, wary of the economic situation, people are still making travel arrangements and spending big in the process.According to Calvin Li of JLL Hotels &amp; Hospitality, sentiments in the travel industry have improved significantly.Story continues“Everyone thought, Rates will decline. This is just a blip. Everyone's traveling now, but it's going to dissipate. That hasn't happened. It hasn't happened in Asia. It hasn't happened in the U.S. or Europe. So, investors are a little bit more confident now that they have more data on their fingertips,” Li said in an interview with CNBC.Experts are already predicting a booming travel demand in 2023, with 26% of Americans planning to increase their spending on leisure travel. Additionally, 53% of all Americans and 81% of leisure travelers have already made arrangements to travel over the next six months.Technological advancement also significantly impacts the travel industry and is one of the catalysts behind robust growth.

The more mundane session followed a rather big pullback from the Nasdaq on Thursday after investors dumped Tesla and Netflix stock to lock in some profits following the massive first-half run.The reactions to Netflix and Tesla, which spilled over into semiconductors and much of tech, could be a sign of what’s to come. Some big tech names that have skyrocketed in 2023 and are trading at or near their highs might have to post big beat-and-raise quarters to keep their runs going in the near term.  In fact, a profit-taking pullback in the coming weeks would possibly prove beneficial to the market.

The ex-dividend date is usually set to be one business day before the record date which is the cut-off date on which you must be present on the company's books as a shareholder in order to receive the dividend. The ex-dividend date is important because any transaction on a stock needs to have been settled before the record date in order to be eligible for a dividend. Thus, you can purchase Bank of New York Mellon's shares before the 27th of July in order to receive the dividend, which the company will pay on the 10th of August.The company's next dividend payment will be US$0.42 per share. Last year, in total, the company distributed US$1.48 to shareholders. Calculating the last year's worth of payments shows that Bank of New York Mellon has a trailing yield of 3.3% on the current share price of $45. We love seeing companies pay a dividend, but it's also important to be sure that laying the golden eggs isn't going to kill our golden goose! As a result, readers should always check whether Bank of New York Mellon has been able to grow its dividends, or if the dividend might be cut. View our latest analysis for Bank of New York Mellon Dividends are usually paid out of company profits, so if a company pays out more than it earned then its dividend is usually at greater risk of being cut. That's why it's good to see Bank of New York Mellon paying out a modest 43% of its earnings.When a company paid out less in dividends than it earned in profit, this generally suggests its dividend is affordable. The lower the % of its profit that it pays out, the greater the margin of safety for the dividend if the business enters a downturn.Click here to see the company's payout ratio, plus analyst estimates of its future dividends.historic-dividendHave Earnings And Dividends Been Growing?Companies that aren't growing their earnings can still be valuable, but it is even more important to assess the sustainability of the dividend if it looks like the company will struggle to grow. Investors love dividends, so if earnings fall and the dividend is reduced, expect a stock to be sold off heavily at the same time. That explains why we're not overly excited about Bank of New York Mellon's flat earnings over the past five years. We'd take that over an earnings decline any day, but in the long run, the best dividend stocks all grow their earnings per share.Story continuesAnother key way to measure a company's dividend prospects is by measuring its historical rate of dividend growth. Bank of New York Mellon has delivered 11% dividend growth per year on average over the past 10 years.The Bottom LineIs Bank of New York Mellon an attractive dividend stock, or better left on the shelf? Bank of New York Mellon's earnings per share are basically flat over the past five years, although it has the cushion of a low payout ratio, which would suggest a cut to the dividend is relatively unlikely. In sum this is a middling combination, and we find it hard to get excited about the company from a dividend perspective.Ever wonder what the future holds for Bank of New York Mellon?

TSN is operating amid tough market conditions with escalated costs. The renowned meat products company is battling hurdles in the Beef and Chicken segments. These downsides have been hurting the company’s profits as seen in the second quarter of fiscal 2023. Management also lowered its revenue guidance for fiscal 2023.Shares of the Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) company have declined 20.6% in the past six months compared with the industry’s decline of 15%. The company’s stock has lagged the Zacks Consumer Staples’s growth of 0.5% during this time.Let’s discuss this in details.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchWeak Performance &amp; Lowered ViewIn the second quarter of fiscal 2023, Tyson Foods’ adjusted loss of 4 cents per share, significantly declined from earnings of $2.29 reported in the year-ago period. Most of the decline in profits was led by reduced earnings in Beef and Chicken segments. Total sales were $13,133 million, almost flat with the year-ago quarter’s levels. Average price changes had a 3.2% adverse impact on the top line.Management lowered its fiscal 2023 revenue guidance, thanks to consumers opting for alternatives amid the inflationary landscape. The company anticipates sales in the band of $53-$54 billion for fiscal 2023, suggesting growth of flat to 1%. Earlier, it expected sales in the range of $55-$57 billion.Cost Woes Hurt MarginIn the second quarter of fiscal 2023, Tyson Foods’ gross profit came in at $527 million, down from the $1,735 million reported in the prior-year quarter. Gross profit, as a percentage of sales, came in at roughly 4%, down from 13.2% reported in the year-ago quarter. TSN’s adjusted operating margin contracted to 0.5% from the 8.9% reported in the year-ago quarter.The company witnessed elevated input costs per pound in all segments, except pork. Most of this was a result of inflated costs of raw materials and labor. Apart from this, the company saw a decline in pricing due to lower outside meat purchases in chicken and slashed supply-chain costs.Story continuesWhat Else is Hurting Tyson Foods?In the second quarter of fiscal 2023, sales in Tyson Foods’ Beef segment declined 8.3% to $4,617 million. The company continued to see increased live cattle costs due to reduced beef herd, which in turn restricted supply. For fiscal 2023, management expects beef segment margins in the range of a 1% loss and a 1% gain due to the deterioration of the current market scenario.Although Chicken segment sales increased in the fiscal second quarter, the macro environment remained difficult. Commodity prices for chicken cuts were quite lower compared with the year-ago period’s levels. Prices of boneless breast meat, tenders and wings declined more than 50%. Further, the company saw a rise in feed ingredient costs. On its second-quarter earnings call, management stated that the key export markets remain closed due to the high-path avian influenza.Final ThoughtsTyson Foods’ is focused on core strategies like driving growth across the core protein platform and solidifying brand portfolio. The company is undertaking a number of operational and supply chain efficiency programs to place itself better in the long run. Management continues to accelerate digitalization via supply chain planning and execution processes to enhance customer service.That being said, let’s see if these upsides can help TSN counter the hurdles mentioned above.Some Better-Ranked Food BetsHere we have highlighted three better-ranked stocks, namely TreeHouse Foods, Inc. THS, Lamb Weston Holdings LW and Celsius Holdings CELH.TreeHouse Foods, a manufacturer of packaged foods and beverages, currently sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). THS has a trailing four-quarter earnings surprise of 49.3%, on average.

LW has a trailing four-quarter earnings surprise of 47.6%, on average.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Lamb Weston’s current financial-year’s sales and earnings indicates growth of 29.6% and 117.3%, respectively, from the year-ago reported figures. The expected EPS growth rate for three to five years is 42.7%.Celsius Holdings, which offers functional drinks and liquid supplements, carries a Zacks Rank #2 at present.

Champi is married to a farmer and has a three-year-old daughter. Her long-term financial goal is to invest in her family's farm, and she is saving towards buying a tractor.The factory where she works recently switched from paying workers in cash to paying wages into a digital bank account. Coupled with financial education, the shift has opened up new conveniences, like online shopping for her daughter, and is helping her save and build a financial cushion.""I've started saving $10 each month,"" says Champi. ""I feel more confident now about my future expenses - if someone is sick, then I have savings to pay the hospital bill.""Since 2018, the Mastercard Center for Inclusive Growth and HERproject have been working together to scale up digital wages for garment factories and workers like Champi in Bangladesh, Egypt and Cambodia. We've seen the longer-term potential of digital wages to drive financial inclusion and resilience and bring low-income workers into the formal financial system. Digital wages have increased the ability of workers, particularly women, to save, plan and respond to crises.Story continuesWorkers are experiencing economic stressors resulting from factors like the lingering effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, the energy crisis, inflation and climate shocks. Globally, about 165 million adults receive private sector wages in cash. Switching to digital wages is an opportunity to create resilience against these economic stressors and start to build financial resilience.Introducing digital wages is most effective when done so in a gender-intentional manner. Women represent nearly 60% of the garment workforce globally, reaching 80% in some regions. Studies show that women who maintain financial accounts have more control over their income and greater influence over household spending. When women have more control over household spending, there is greater investment in education and health, leading to wider benefits for families and local economies.Digitizing wages can build financial inclusion by driving usage, trust and confidence to use financial products, which can lead to an increase in savings and better financial management. By empowering women workers with knowledge and skills, they can make more informed financial decisions, improve their financial well-being and build a stronger financial future. For example, after digitizing wages and participation in the HERfinance Digital Wages program (now RISE Financial Health), 96% of workers surveyed at one factory in Egypt reported that they now preferred to be paid in a bank account, rising from 2% at the start of the program. Four in 10 women said they were saving every month after the program implementation.Digitizing wages is good for business too. For factories, wage digitization offers timely, accurate payments and reduces the risk of errors or fraud. Brands and buyers welcome the greater efficiency and transparency. One study conducted by the World Bank showed that after two years of digitizing payroll, factories had slashed costs by 45%.The opportunity now lies in creating impact at scale. We have tested our hypotheses through our collaboration over the past four years, and we have evidence of the benefits of digital wages for financial health and inclusion. We now seek to replicate and expand these benefits to more women workers. Partnerships will be crucial in this effort, which is why the Mastercard Center for Inclusive Growth has become the anchor partner for RISE's Financial Health focus area, doubling down on its support for women workers in global garment supply chains.We look forward to working together to expand and deepen the impact of economic empowerment for women workers, and we will share what we learn through reports on our work in Cambodia and Egypt later this year.Photos courtesy of RISEOriginally published by The Mastercard Center for Inclusive GrowthCheck out more content from The Mastercard Center for Inclusive GrowthThe Mastercard Center for Inclusive Growth, Friday, July 21, 2023, Press release pictureView additional multimedia and more ESG storytelling from The Mastercard Center for Inclusive Growth on 3blmedia.com.Contact Info:Spokesperson: The Mastercard Center for Inclusive GrowthWebsite: https://www.3blmedia.com/profiles/mastercard-center-inclusive-growthEmail: info@3blmedia.comSOURCE: The Mastercard Center for Inclusive GrowthView source version on accesswire.com: https://www.accesswire.com/769623/Advancing-the-Financial-Health-of-Women-Workers-in-Global-Supply-Chains]"

132,b4abdcb0-7fea-3e7b-bf55-01a62d6c91a7,BAX,2023-07-22,Baxter International (NYSE:BAX) Is Due To Pay A Dividend Of $0.29,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/baxter-international-nyse-bax-due-120647159.html,1690027607,STORY,['BAX'],"[Baxter International Inc. (NYSE:BAX) will pay a dividend of $0.29 on the 2nd of October. Based on this payment, the dividend yield on the company's stock will be 2.4%, which is an attractive boost to shareholder returns. See our latest analysis for Baxter International Baxter International's Payment Has Solid Earnings CoverageImpressive dividend yields are good, but this doesn't matter much if the payments can't be sustained. Baxter International is not generating a profit, and despite this is paying out most of its free cash flow as a dividend. Generally paying a dividend without making profits isn't a great idea and we are also worried that there is limited reinvestment into the business.Looking forward, earnings per share is forecast to rise exponentially over the next year. Assuming the dividend continues along recent trends, we think the payout ratio will be 9.1%, which makes us pretty comfortable with the sustainability of the dividend.historic-dividendDividend VolatilityThe company's dividend history has been marked by instability, with at least one cut in the last 10 years. The dividend has gone from an annual total of $1.80 in 2013 to the most recent total annual payment of $1.16. This works out to be a decline of approximately 4.3% per year over that time. Generally, we don't like to see a dividend that has been declining over time as this can degrade shareholders' returns and indicate that the company may be running into problems.The Dividend Has Limited Growth PotentialGiven that the dividend has been cut in the past, we need to check if earnings are growing and if that might lead to stronger dividends in the future. Baxter International's earnings per share has shrunk at 38% a year over the past five years. Such rapid declines definitely have the potential to constrain dividend payments if the trend continues into the future. Over the next year, however, earnings are actually predicted to rise, but we would still be cautious until a track record of earnings growth can be built.Story continuesBaxter International's Dividend Doesn't Look SustainableOverall, it's nice to see a consistent dividend payment, but we think that longer term, the current level of payment might be unsustainable. The payments are bit high to be considered sustainable, and the track record isn't the best. We would probably look elsewhere for an income investment.Market movements attest to how highly valued a consistent dividend policy is compared to one which is more unpredictable. However, there are other things to consider for investors when analysing stock performance. To that end, Baxter International has 2 warning signs (and 1 which shouldn't be ignored) we think you should know about.

133,ff6a0862-48ea-3ba7-b905-1b8fe4116554,BAX,2023-07-22,Baxter (BAX) to Post Q2 Earnings: What's in the Offing?,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/baxter-bax-post-q2-earnings-135700355.html,1689947820,STORY,"['BAX', 'MCK']","[Baxter International Inc. BAX is scheduled to release second-quarter 2023 results on Jul 27, before the opening bell. In the last reported quarter, the company’s earnings beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 22.92%. BAX’s earnings missed estimates in two of the trailing four quarters, met once and beat in the other, delivering an average surprise of 3.85%.Q2 EstimatesCurrently, the consensus estimate for second-quarter revenues is pegged at $3.79 billion, indicating an improvement of 1.3% from the prior-year quarter’s figure. The same for earnings is pinned at 59 cents per share, implying a 32.2% year-over-year decline.Factors to NoteFor the second quarter, Baxter expects sales to grow 1-2% on a reported basis and 2-3% at constant currency basis. Adjusted earnings per share is expected between 59 cents and 61 cents. Earnings outlook for the quarter reflects inflationary pressure, rising interest expense and higher tax rate.Robust demand for Baxter’s broad multi-chamber product offering is likely to have continued in the second quarter, driving sales of its Clinical Nutrition segment. Moreover, a continued rise in surgical volume and elective surgical procedures is expected to have fueled strong growth in Advanced Surgery’s sales.Our estimate for Clinical Nutrition and Advanced Surgery’s second-quarter 2023 sales is pegged at $231.2 million and $260.9 million, respectively.Renal Care segment sales reflected recovering trend during the first quarter, following a decline in the previous two quarters. However, a potential decline in China due to the impact of various government-based procurement initiatives might have continued to hurt Renal sales during the soon-to-be-reported quarter.Meanwhile, strong growth in Baxter’s PD business and IV therapy portfolio is likely to have been more than offset by lower in-center HD sales, lower infusion system sales and unfavorable currency movement. Our estimate for the segment’s sales is pegged at $966.3 million.Story continuesThe company has multiple collaborations to help manufacture COVID-19 vaccines. However, sales growth of the BioPharma Solutions segment is likely to have been hurt by challenging year-over-year comparisons, resulting from prior-year COVID-related sales.Sales at Acute Therapies segment are also expected to have experienced a similar impact in the soon-to-be-reported quarter. Our estimate for BioPharma Solutions and Acute Therapies’ sales is pegged at $165.7 million and $155 million, respectively.Sales of the Pharmaceutical segment are likely to have been boosted by strong growth in U.S. injectables portfolio, partially offset by lower sales for injectables in the international market. Our estimate for the segment’s sales is pinned at $525 million.In the first quarter of 2023, all of Baxter’s global regions performed weakly due to unfavorable currency movements. In the Americas, the company reported revenues of $1.6 billion, down 1% from the prior-year quarter’s level.In EMEA, revenues totaled $714 million, up 2% from the year-ago quarter’s figure. In APAC, revenues of $602 million were down 4% year over year. The trend is likely to have continued in the to-be-reported quarter.Meanwhile, three new product categories that were added with the Hillrom buyout in December 2021 generated $731 million in the first quarter. These products are likely to have brought additional sales during the second quarter.Continued demand for the physical assessment and cardiology portfolios within the Front Line Care business might have driven Hillrom’s second-quarter sales. Meanwhile, inflationary pressure as well as freight and supply-chain constraints are likely to have increased cost of goods, hurting gross margin. However, these headwinds are likely to be softer than those in the last reported quarter.Baxter has proposed the spin-off of its Kidney Care company, including Renal Care and Acute Therapies businesses, earlier this year. It expects to complete the spin-off by July 2024 or earlier. The company is also pursuing strategic alternatives for its BioPharma Solutions business. Investors may ask questions related to the proposed spin-off during the company’s second-quarter earnings call. BAX may provide an update related to its progress with strategic alternatives for BioPharma Solutions business.In June, Baxter launched Progressa+ bed for intensive care units in the United States. This bed has been designed to help nurses care for patients and support patient recovery. The company may provide an update on the launch progress on its second-quarter earnings call.Baxter International Inc. Price and ConsensusBaxter International Inc.

134,b343b07a-0b3b-35d1-80c5-4a1cf92928db,JNJ,2023-07-22,Dow notches tenth straight day of gains,Yahoo Finance Video,https://finance.yahoo.com/video/dow-notches-tenth-straight-day-205117980.html,1689972677,VIDEO,"['JPM', '^SPX', 'JNJ', 'AXP', '^DJI', '^IXIC']","[The Dow Jones Industrial Average eked out a tenth straight day of gains, closing just 2.5 points higher on Friday. Yahoo Finance Live breaks down how earnings from components such as JPMorgan Chase and American Express impacted the index's action this week.Video TranscriptSEANA SMITH: Let's break down some of the biggest moves that we've seen over the last several trading days and taking a look at the Dow's performance over the last five days, closing up just about 2%. Like I just said, that 3-point gain that we did see today, enough for the Dow to close in positive territory here, Miles, for 10 straight trading days in a row.We've seen a number of Dow components report results over the last couple of trading days. Amex was out this morning. That disappointed the Street, the worst performer in the Dow today. But strong results from JP Morgan earlier this week. Johnson &amp; Johnson, that did give the index a little bit of a lift.- Yeah. And I think, you know, watching the Dow's performance this week is as watching, the market's overall start to do the rotation that all the bears thought needed to happen, otherwise, the market was going to go down, which is we had this narrow leadership where tech is doing all of the driving, pushing us higher. NASDAQ's up 35% or whatever it was at the peak. And everyone says, when's everybody else going to get into the mix.And you look at today's market on a sector level. And you have XLC Communication Services, that's down 1%. Meanwhile utilities are up 1.5%. Health care is up 1%. Energy is up 9/10 of 1%. So you're starting to see these more cyclical sectors get in the mix. That's a little bit more heavily weighted within the Dow. Certainly, the NASDAQ being a laggard, you know, would be indicative of that.But another interesting day in the sense of the indexes, you know, not really telling the story. Like, I think you have to look at sector level. And then certainly at some individual names where you had some action today. You know, look at the life sciences names. Names like Danaher, Thermo Fisher, they were big winners today.And so watching those dynamics play out has really been interesting here, as the market moves into the phase that again quote, unquote, everyone said we needed to enter if we were going to have a more constructive kind of bull run.]"
135,966d2d02-cde1-361d-a0d0-f0c7dca1782e,JNJ,2023-07-22,AbbVie (ABBV) to Report Q2 Earnings: What's in the Cards?,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/abbvie-abbv-report-q2-earnings-170500351.html,1689959100,STORY,"['ABBV', 'AZN', 'JNJ']","[AbbVie ABBV will report second-quarter 2023 results on Jul 27, before market open. In the last reported quarter, the company delivered an earnings surprise of 0.82%.Factors to ConsiderAbbVie’s top line is expected to have been driven by sales of new immunology drugs, Skyrizi and Rinvoq, which registered strong growth in the past few quarters. The upside can be attributed to label expansions of both drugs to allow use in new patient populations in the last few quarters. This trend is expected to have continued in the to-be-reported quarter.During the second quarter, Rinvoq received label expansion approvals in Crohn’s disease indication in both the United States and European Union. The Zacks Consensus Estimate and our model estimates for Rinvoq are pegged at $896 million and $878 million, respectively.The Zacks Consensus Estimate and our model estimates for Skyrizi are pegged at $1.77 billion and $1.76 billion, respectively.Growth in Rinvoq and Skyrizi sales is expected to partially make up for the fall in sales of the flagship drug Humira’. The drug recently lost exclusivity in the United States following the launch of Amgen’s Amjevita in first-quarter 2023, the first U.S. biosimilar to Humira. Many other companies, like Boehringer Ingelheim, Samsung Bioepis and Novartis (through its Sandoz generic arm), have also launched their own Humira biosimilars this month. More such biosimilars are expected to be launched throughout this year. The impact of these biosimilars on Humira sales will be seen in subsequent quarters. The drug has already lost the exclusivity in ex-U.S. territories following the launch of generics in 2018.The Zacks Consensus Estimate and our model estimate for Humira are pegged at $3.93 billion and $3.95 billion, respectively.In the hematologic oncology segment, AbbVie markets two drugs, namely Imbruvica and Venclexta, in partnership with Johnson &amp; Johnson JNJ and Roche RHHBY, respectivelyWe expect JNJ-partnered Imbruvica sales to decline due to novel oral therapies hurting the drug’s sales. During the onset of the second quarter, AbbVie and J&amp;J voluntarily withdrew the accelerated approvals granted by the FDA to Imbruvica in two indications — mantle cell lymphoma and marginal zone lymphoma — since data from confirmatory studies did not support conversion to full approval. This is likely to have led to a fall in sales during the quarter. For the J&amp;J-partnered drug, the Zacks Consensus Estimate and our model estimates are pegged at $875 million and $884 million, respectively.Story continuesSales of Roche-partnered Venclexta sales are likely to rise as new patient starts are expected to improve. The Zacks Consensus Estimate and our model estimates for the Roche-partnered drug stand at $556 million.In the aesthetics franchise, we expect overall sales to fall as economic pressure is impacting consumers’ discretionary spending. ABBV’s suspension of its aesthetics business operations in Russia also affected the company’s sales, as Russia is a key market for fillers. The Zacks Consensus Estimate and our model estimate for aesthetics product sales is pegged at $1.33 billion and $1.32 billion, respectively.Sales of the neuroscience franchise have shown strong growth in recent quarters, with sales likely to be driven by the recently-approved migraine drugs — Ubrelvy and Qulipta. The Zacks Consensus Estimate and our model estimate suggest neuroscience product sales at $1.82 billion and $1.78 billion, respectively.Investor are likely to forward questions regarding updates on new product launches.Key Development in Q2In May 2023, the FDA granted approval to Epkinly (epcoritamab) for treatment of adults with relapsed or refractory diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL). The drug will be marketed in the country in partnership with Genmab.A regulatory filing for the drug in a similar indication is currently under review in the European Union. If approved, the drug will be marketed under the brand name Tepkinly.Earnings Surprise HistoryAbbVie’s performance has been impressive, with its earnings beating estimates in each of the trailing four quarters.

The world's biggest healthcare products’ maker continued with its long streak of earnings beat.

Revenues grew 6.3% year over year to $25.5 billion and edged past the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $24.7 billion (see:all the Healthcare ETFs here).The company is benefiting from a rebound in demand for nonurgent surgeries among older adults, who deferred those procedures during the COVID-19 pandemic.For 2023, Johnson &amp; Johnson lifted the revenue guidance to $98.80-$99.80 billion from the previous outlook of $97.9-$98.9 billion. It also raised the earnings per share guidance to $10.70-$10.80 from the previous outlook of $10.60-$10.70. The Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at $98.90 for revenues and $10.65 for earnings per share. The solid outlook is driven by the strength in its medical devices business and demand for its cancer drugs such as Darzalex.iShares U.S. Pharmaceuticals ETF (IHE)iShares U.S. Pharmaceuticals ETF provides exposure to 40 companies that manufacture prescription or over-the-counter drugs or vaccines by tracking the Dow Jones U.S. Select Pharmaceuticals Index.

Knowing whether insiders are buying is usually more helpful when evaluating insider transactions, as insider selling can have various explanations. However, when multiple insiders sell stock over a specific duration, shareholders should take notice as that could possibly be a red flag.While we would never suggest that investors should base their decisions solely on what the directors of a company have been doing, we do think it is perfectly logical to keep tabs on what insiders are doing. See our latest analysis for Johnson &amp; Johnson The Last 12 Months Of Insider Transactions At Johnson &amp; JohnsonIn the last twelve months, the biggest single sale by an insider was when the insider, Kathryn Wengel, sold US$2.0m worth of shares at a price of US$160 per share. That means that an insider was selling shares at slightly below the current price (US$168). We generally consider it a negative if insiders have been selling, especially if they did so below the current price, because it implies that they considered a lower price to be reasonable. Please do note, however, that sellers may have a variety of reasons for selling, so we don't know for sure what they think of the stock price. This single sale was just 16% of Kathryn Wengel's stake.In the last year Johnson &amp; Johnson insiders didn't buy any company stock. The chart below shows insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last year. If you want to know exactly who sold, for how much, and when, simply click on the graph below!insider-trading-volumeFor those who like to find winning investments this free list of growing companies with recent insider purchasing, could be just the ticket.Insiders At Johnson &amp; Johnson Have Sold Stock RecentlyThe last three months saw significant insider selling at Johnson &amp; Johnson. In total, insider Kathryn Wengel dumped US$2.0m worth of shares in that time, and we didn't record any purchases whatsoever. In light of this it's hard to argue that all the insiders think that the shares are a bargain.Story continuesInsider Ownership Of Johnson &amp; JohnsonMany investors like to check how much of a company is owned by insiders. Usually, the higher the insider ownership, the more likely it is that insiders will be incentivised to build the company for the long term. Johnson &amp; Johnson insiders own about US$380m worth of shares (which is 0.09% of the company). I like to see this level of insider ownership, because it increases the chances that management are thinking about the best interests of shareholders.So What Do The Johnson &amp; Johnson Insider Transactions Indicate?An insider hasn't bought Johnson &amp; Johnson stock in the last three months, but there was some selling. And even if we look at the last year, we didn't see any purchases. While insiders do own a lot of shares in the company (which is good), our analysis of their transactions doesn't make us feel confident about the company. So these insider transactions can help us build a thesis about the stock, but it's also worthwhile knowing the risks facing this company. While conducting our analysis, we found that Johnson &amp; Johnson has 3 warning signs and it would be unwise to ignore them.But note: Johnson &amp; Johnson may not be the best stock to buy. So take a peek at this free list of interesting companies with high ROE and low debt.For the purposes of this article, insiders are those individuals who report their transactions to the relevant regulatory body.

Moreover, tight labor market data also bolstered market participants’ concern that the Fed may continue to pursue interest rate hike regime. The Dow ended in positive territory, while both the S&amp;P 500 and the Nasdaq Composite finished in negative zone.How Did The Benchmarks Perform?The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJI) rose 0.5% or 163.97 points to close at 35,225.18, marking its highest closing since April 2022. Notably, 22 components of the 30-stock index ended in positive territory, while eight in negative zone. The blue-chip index posted ninth consecutive winning days for the first time since 2017.The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite finished at 14,063.31, tumbling 2% or 294.71 points due to weak performance of large-cap technology stocks. The S&amp;P 500 fell 0.7% to end at 4,534.87. Seven out of 11 broad sectors of the benchmark ended in positive zone while tfour finished in negative territory.The Energy Select Sector SPDR (XLE), the Health Care Select Sector SPDR (XLV) and the Utilities Select Sector SPDR (XLU) advanced 1.1%, 1.7% and 1.8%, respectively. On the other hand, the Technology Select Sector SPDR (XLK), the Communication Services Select Sector SPDR (XLC) and the Consumer Discretionary Select Sector SPDR (XLY) plummeted 2%, 2% and 3.4%, respectively.The fear-gauge CBOE Volatility Index (VIX) was up 1.7% to 13.99. A total of 11.16 billion shares were traded on Thursday, higher than the last 20-session average of 10.6 billion. Decliners outnumbered decliners on the NYSE by a 1.53-to-1 ratio. On Nasdaq, a 1.88-to-1 ratio favored declining issues.Mixed Q2 Earnings ResultsJohnson &amp; Johnson’s JNJ second-quarter 2023 earnings came in at $2.80 per share, which beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.61. Sales of this drug and consumer products giant came in at $25.53 billion, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $24.68 billion.Story continuesNetflix Inc. NFLX reported second-quarter 2023 earnings of $3.29 per share, which beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 16.25% and increased 2.8% year over year. Revenues of $8.19 billion increased 2.7% year over year but lagged the consensus mark by 0.93%. On a foreign-exchange neutral basis, revenues grew 6% year over year.Tesla Inc. TSLA reported second-quarter 2023 earnings of $0.91 per share, which rose from the year-ago figure of $0.76 and outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $0.83. Total revenues came in at $24,927 million, witnessing year-over-year growth of 47%. The top line exceeded the consensus mark of $24,884 million.However, Tesla’s operating margins dipped to single digits in the quarter under discussion. The metric came in at 9.6% (the lowest level in the past five quarters). The underperformance can be attributed to unexpectedly higher costs involved in scaling up the production of new battery cells, the Cybertruck, and other large projects. Management said vehicle production would slow during the third quarter due to shutdowns for factory improvements.Consequently, the stock price of Johnson &amp; Johnson jumped 6.1%, while Netflix and Tesla plunged 8.4% and 9.7%, respectively. All the three stocks currently carry a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

The index jumped more than 150 points yesterday to log its first nine-day rally since 2017, per a CNBC article. Better-than-expected earnings results from drugmaker Johnson &amp; Johnson JNJ boosted the index on Jul 20.Moreover, Dow Jones companies have come up with upbeat results this reporting cycle while tech biggies like Netflix (NFLX) and Tesla (TSLA) slumped post earnings release. SPDR Dow Jones Industrial Average ETF DIA has added about 3.8% past month versus a 3.5% uptick in the S&amp;P 500 (as of Jul 20, 2023) while DIA is up 2.4% in the past week versus 0.6% increase seen in the S&amp;P 500.Rising Bond Yields: A Tailwind for Dow JonesIf this was not enough, a spike in long-term U.S. treasury bond yields helped the value-centric Dow Jones gain precedence over the growth-oriented Nasdaq. The benchmark U.S. treasury yield was 3.85% on Jul 20, 2023, up 10 bps from the day before.Since value stocks perform better in a rising rate environment than growth stocks, Dow Jones had every reason to record jump yesterday. The trend is likely to be the same as the Fed is likely to hike rates this month amid a resilient economy and sticky inflation.Inside the Stocks That Played a Crucial Role Below we highlight a few stocks that played a crucial role in the Dow Jones’ latest rally. These stocks will likely help the Dow Jones to keep the momentum going.JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. (JPM) – Up 8.3% in Past Nine Days The Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) company is one of the biggest global banks. JPMorgan's shares have outperformed the industry in the past six months. The company acquired failed First Republic Bank for $10.6 billion, which is expected to be accretive to earnings.A resilient U.S. consumer base will likely help the bank as it has extensive consumer franchises. Increased credit card borrowing, higher loan charges, and robust consumer spending will likely act as strength for J.P. Morgan. Overall, higher rates, global expansion initiatives and a decent loan demand will support net interest income (NII). The stock has a Top Momentum Score of “A”.Story continuesUnitedHealth Group (UNH) – Up 9.3% in Past Nine Days The Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company provides a wide range of health care products and services, such as health maintenance organizations (HMOs), point of service plans (POS), preferred provider organizations (PPOs), and managed fee-for-service programs. UnitedHealth beat on both lines in the second-quarter 2023 earnings reporting season.On the basis of solid performance exhibited in the first half of 2023, adjusted net EPS is presently anticipated within $24.70 and $25.00, compared with the prior guidance of $24.50-$25.00. Net EPS are projected to lie between $23.45 and $23.75, compared with the previous view of $23.25-$23.75. The stock has a Top-rated Value score of “A” and Growth Score of “B.”Johnson &amp; Johnson (JNJ) – Up 5.7% in Past Nine DaysThe Zacks Rank #3 pharma company’s biggest strength is its diversified business model. It operates through pharmaceuticals, medical devices and consumer products divisions. The company beat on both lines in the ongoing earnings season. The company also hiked its full-year guidance.J&amp;J is now forecasting full-year sales of $98.80 billion to $99.80 billion, about $1 billion higher than the guidance provided in April. The company lifted its 2023 adjusted earnings outlook to $10.70 to $10.80 per share, from a previous forecast of $10.60 to $10.70 per share. J&amp;J has upbeat Value &amp; Growth score of “B.”Salesforce (CRM) – Up 9.1% in Past Nine DaysThe Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) company is the leading provider of on-demand Customer Relationship Management (CRM) software, which enables organizations to better manage critical operations, such as sales force automation, customer service and support, marketing automation, document management, analytics and custom application development.Salesforce is benefiting from a robust demand environment as customers are undergoing a major digital transformation. Its sustained focus on introducing more aligned products as per customer needs is driving its top-line. Continued deal wins in the international market is another growth driver.

CCI 15-Year Financial DataThe intrinsic value of CCIPeter Lynch Chart of CCIThrough this extensive network, Crown Castle facilitates the seamless connection of cities and communities, enabling access to vital data, technology and wireless services. The companys unmatched portfolio of towers solidifies its position as a key player in the telecommunications industry in this transformative era.Financial performance and future projectionsCrown Castle's second-quarter financial results exceeded expectations, highlighting the long-term opportunities in the 5G deployment market in the U.S. The company reported a significant 10% year-over-year growth in site rental revenue to $1.72 billion, or an increase of $161 million compared to the prior-year quarter. This growth includes approximately $155 million from organic contribution to site rental billings, despite a $30 million decrease in straight-lined revenue and a $36 million increase in amortization of prepaid rent.Notably, the site rental revenue also benefited from a $100 million net contribution from lease cancellations linked to the T-Mobile and Sprint network consolidation. Out of this contribution, $97 million came from small cells and $3 million from fiber solutions. Additionally, the revenue included $57 million in accelerated prepaid rent amortization related to small cells.Looking ahead, Crown Castle anticipates lower tower activity for the remainder of the year due to carriers reducing network spending. According to Dell'Oro Group, the telecom industry is on the cusp of a substantial change in spending and capital expenditure trends. Their findings indicate an imminent decoupling of telecom spending, hinting at a more intricate path for the global telecommunications landscape.Story continuesThe overall capital expenditure is expected decline following a general downward trend with a negative compounded annual growth rate of 2% to 3% over the next three years. As a result, the company expects contribution from services to decrease, impacting the full-year outlook. However, the company emphasized that its long-term leasing agreements with customers will mitigate the impact on site rental revenue. Further, wireline and wireless telecom equipment spending remains positive with Dell'Oro Group anticipating a 1% year-over-year increase in 2023.Growth strategy and financial stabilityDespite the challenges posed by reduced tower activity, Crown Castle remains optimistic about its core business growth in 2023. The company projects a 5% organic growth in towers, deployment of 10,000 small cell nodes and a return to 3% fiber solutions growth by the end of the year. The company's confidence in its long-term prospects is supported by the significant mobile data demand increase in the U.S., which is expected to drive continued growth in its core business.Further Crown Castle anticipates double-digit annual revenue growth in its small cell business over the next few years, supported by an existing backlog of 60,000 nodes. This growth is instrumental in the company's target to achieve long-term annual dividend growth of 7% to 8% beyond 2025.To maintain financial strength and flexibility, Crown Castle strategically issued $1.35 billion of long-term fixed-rate debt in the second quarter, securing a weighted average interest rate of approximately 5%. As a result, by the end of the second quarter, over 90% of the companys debt was fixed-rate with an average maturity of eight years, and only 7% of its debt is maturing through 2024. The company boasts over $6 billion of available liquidity under its revolving credit facility. The company remains sufficiently liquidated to survive the short-term challenges faced by the industry.Industry outlook and 5G adoptionThe future of wireless usage appears exceptionally promising, with Ericsson's projections indicating global monthly average use per smartphone will reach 47 gigabytes by the end of 2028 from 20 GB in 2023. By the end of 2023, 1.5 billion 5G subscriptions are expected worldwide, and North America stands out as a frontrunner with the highest subscription penetration at 41% by the end of 2022. This trend is set to continue, with more than 250 million additional 5G subscriptions projected for 2023.The enterprise segment is also witnessing significant adoption of 5G, with wireless wide area networks serving branch office locations and mobile professionals. Looking ahead to 2028, an astonishing 410 million 5G subscriptions are predicted, accounting for over 90% of all mobile subscriptions. North America is forecast to lead the way with a remarkable 91% 5G penetration, followed closely by Western Europe at 88%. With such remarkable growth projections, 5G subscriptions are anticipated to reach an impressive 4.6 billion globally by the end of 2028, constituting over 50% of all mobile subscriptions. As a result, 5G will establish itself as the dominant mobile access technology by subscriptions in 2028.5G technology and the smartphone marketDespite challenges in the overall smartphone market, the adoption of 5G technology remains robust. Notably, the high-end segment has displayed resilience, with global market leaders outperforming the average. While smartphone shipments experienced a double-digit decline in the fourth quarter of 2022, shipments are projected to recover in the second half of 2023. The proliferation of 5G smartphones is a key driver in this trend, with over 870 models launched so far and more than 80 expected in 2023. By the end of the year, 5G smartphones are projected to constitute a significant 62% of all smartphones shipped.Fixed wireless access over 5GEricsson also reported that although foldable devices saw a noteworthy 26% growth in shipments in 2022, they still represent a modest 1% of the smartphone market. In contrast, fixed wireless access over 5G has gained considerable traction. Over 40% of FWA service providers, totaling more than 100, now offer this service over 5G. North America and Western Europe lead the regional adoption with close to 70% of FWA service providers providing it over 5G.Looking ahead to 2028, the number of FWA connections worldwide is projected to surge from 100 million at the end of 2022 to an impressive 300 million. This will account for approximately 17% of all fixed broadband connections. Of these projected FWA connections, nearly 80% are expected to be enabled by 5G technology.This data indicates that, despite the challenges faced in the smartphone market, the rise of 5G adoption and the increasing prevalence of fixed wireless access over 5G will play a significant role in shaping the future of mobile communication and connectivity. As 5G continues to drive innovation and reshape the telecommunications industry, its widespread adoption is poised to transform the way people and businesses access and utilize data, creating new opportunities and possibilities in the digital landscape.Crown Castle's market positionAs wireless connectivity continues to play an increasingly crucial role in todays high-tech world, Crown Castle stands to benefit substantially due to its strategic position in the market. One of the company's key strengths lies in its built-in growth through existing customer contracts with major players in the telecommunications industry. This strategic positioning allows the company to thrive in the ever-expanding wireless connectivity market.ConclusionThe rapid growth of 5G mobile subscriptions is undeniably transforming the global telecommunications landscape, ushering in a new era of connectivity and innovation. As a key player in this transformative industry, Crown Castle stands out as one of the biggest winners.The company's strategic position and extensive infrastructure have placed it in a favorable position to capitalize on the industry's evolution and meet the surging demand for wireless communication assets.

The CHMP’s recommendation will now be reviewed by the European Commission (EC) for marketing authorization in the European Union (EU) and a final decision is expected later this year.""Today’s positive CHMP opinion is the next step for gefapixant to become the first treatment approved in the European Union for adults with refractory or unexplained chronic cough,"" said Dr. Joerg Koglin, senior vice president, global clinical development, Merck Research Laboratories. ""Refractory or unexplained chronic cough as a condition with often disruptive, uncontrolled coughing associated with major physical, social and emotional consequences represents a large unmet clinical need.""The CHMP’s positive opinion is based on results from the COUGH-1 and COUGH-2 clinical trials, which are the first companion Phase 3 studies ever completed in patients with refractory or unexplained chronic cough, a cough that persists despite appropriate treatment of underlying conditions or for which the underlying cause cannot be identified despite a thorough evaluation. Both studies met the primary endpoint, demonstrating a statistically significant reduction in 24-hour cough frequency in adults treated with gefapixant 45 mg twice daily versus placebo at 12 weeks (COUGH-1) and 24 weeks (COUGH-2).About the COUGH-1 and COUGH-2 trialsCOUGH-1 (NCT03449134) and COUGH-2 (NCT03449147) are Phase 3 multinational, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled studies that evaluated the efficacy and safety of gefapixant in reducing cough frequency in adult participants with refractory chronic cough (RCC) or unexplained chronic cough (UCC). A total of 2,044 participants were treated in COUGH-1 (n=730) and COUGH-2 (n=1,314). In both studies, patients were randomly selected to receive one of the following: gefapixant 45 mg twice daily, gefapixant 15 mg twice daily, or placebo. The primary efficacy outcomes for COUGH-1 and COUGH-2 were 24-hour cough frequency at week 12 and 24-hour cough frequency at week 24, respectively, measured using an ambulatory digital audio recording device. Secondary endpoints included awake cough frequency and percentage of participants with a greater than 1.3-point increase from baseline in the Leicester Cough Questionnaire (LCQ) total score. COUGH-1 had a 12-week treatment period and a 40-week safety-extension period, while COUGH-2 had a 24-week treatment period and a 28-week safety-extension period.Story continuesIn these studies, adults treated with gefapixant 45 mg twice daily demonstrated a statistically significant reduction in 24-hour cough frequency (measured objectively, as coughs per hour, using 24-hour sound recordings) versus placebo at 12 weeks (COUGH-1) (18.45% reduction relative to placebo, 95% CI [-32.92, -0.9; p=0.041]) and 24 weeks (COUGH-2) (14.64% reduction relative to placebo, 95% CI [-26.01, -1.4; p=0.031]). The gefapixant 15 mg twice daily treatment arms did not meet the primary efficacy endpoint in either Phase 3 study. The Phase 3 study results were published in The Lancet.In 2022, Merck announced that additional analyses were underway to address questions received from regulatory authorities. The questions were primarily related to the cough counting system used in generating the Phase 3 data, on which the marketing authorization application for gefapixant was based. The results of the additional analyses were generally consistent with the published Phase 3 results from COUGH-1 and COUGH-2.About gefapixantGefapixant is an investigational, orally administered, selective P2X3 receptor antagonist, for the potential treatment of refractory or unexplained chronic cough. P2X3 receptors are one of the receptor types found on sensory nerve fibers, predominantly C fibers, in the airway lining. Chemical stimuli, including adenosine triphosphate (ATP), can be released from airway lining cells due to airway inflammation, irritation, and mechanical stress/injury. Binding of extracellular ATP to P2X3 receptors on C fibers in the airway can be sensed as a signal of potential damage, creating an action potential, which may initiate coughing. The inhibition of binding of extracellular ATP to P2X3 receptors is thought to reduce sensory nerve activation and, subsequently, cough.In 2022, gefapixant under the brand name LYFNUA®, was approved in Japan and Switzerland for treatment of adults with refractory or unexplained chronic cough.About chronic coughThe prevalence of chronic cough (a cough lasting more than 8 weeks) is estimated to be approximately 5 to 10% of adults globally. In a subset of these cases, patients either do not respond to treatment of underlying conditions (such as asthma or gastroesophageal reflux), known as refractory chronic cough (RCC), or they have no identifiable underlying condition despite a thorough evaluation, known as unexplained chronic cough (UCC). In the EU, there are currently no approved therapies for the treatment of RCC or UCC.About MerckAt Merck, known as MSD outside of the United States and Canada, we are unified around our purpose: We use the power of leading-edge science to save and improve lives around the world.

""We look forward to the European Commission’s decision and are excited at the possibility of bringing the first approved immunotherapy regimen for the first-line treatment of these patients with HER2-positive advanced gastric or GEJ cancer to the EU.""The recommendation is based on interim results from the Phase 3 KEYNOTE-811 trial, in which the KEYTRUDA regimen demonstrated a statistically significant improvement in progression-free survival (PFS) and objective response rate (ORR) compared to trastuzumab and chemotherapy alone in patients whose tumors expressed PD-L1 (CPS ≥1). In the study, more than 80% of patients had tumors that were PD-L1 positive. These PFS results will be presented at an upcoming medical meeting. The CHMP’s recommendation will now be reviewed by the European Commission for marketing authorization in the European Union, and a final decision is expected in the third quarter of 2023.Story continuesIn May 2021, KEYTRUDA was approved in combination with trastuzumab, fluoropyrimidine- and platinum-containing chemotherapy for the first-line treatment of patients with locally advanced unresectable or metastatic HER2-positive gastric or GEJ adenocarcinoma in the U.S. This indication was approved by the FDA under accelerated approval based on ORR data from KEYNOTE-811, and continued approval for this indication may be contingent upon verification and description of clinical benefit in the confirmatory trials. Merck is working with the FDA to update this indication to patients whose tumors are PD-L1 positive.Merck has an extensive clinical development program evaluating KEYTRUDA in gastrointestinal cancers and is continuing to study KEYTRUDA for multiple uses in gastric, hepatobiliary, esophageal, and colorectal cancers.About gastric cancerGastric (stomach) cancer tends to develop slowly over many years and rarely causes early symptoms, resulting in most cases going undetected until an advanced stage. More than 70% of patients with gastric cancer develop advanced-stage disease. Most gastric cancers are adenocarcinomas (about 90-95%), which develop from cells in the innermost lining of the stomach (known as the mucosa). Gastric cancer is the fifth most diagnosed cancer and the fourth leading cause of cancer death worldwide, with approximately 1.1 million patients diagnosed and 768,000 patient deaths from the disease globally in 2020. In Europe, it is estimated there were approximately 136,000 patients diagnosed with gastric cancer and 97,000 patient deaths from the disease in 2020. The five-year survival rate for patients diagnosed with gastric cancer at an advanced stage is only 6%.About KEYTRUDA® (pembrolizumab) injection, 100 mgKEYTRUDA is an anti-programmed death receptor-1 (PD-1) therapy that works by increasing the ability of the body’s immune system to help detect and fight tumor cells. KEYTRUDA is a humanized monoclonal antibody that blocks the interaction between PD-1 and its ligands, PD- L1 and PD-L2, thereby activating T lymphocytes which may affect both tumor cells and healthy cells.Merck has the industry’s largest immuno-oncology clinical research program. There are currently more than 1,600 trials studying KEYTRUDA across a wide variety of cancers and treatment settings. The KEYTRUDA clinical program seeks to understand the role of KEYTRUDA across cancers and the factors that may predict a patient's likelihood of benefitting from treatment with KEYTRUDA, including exploring several different biomarkers.Selected KEYTRUDA® (pembrolizumab) Indications in the U.S.Gastric CancerKEYTRUDA, in combination with trastuzumab, fluoropyrimidine- and platinum-containing chemotherapy, is indicated for the first-line treatment of patients with locally advanced unresectable or metastatic HER2-positive gastric or gastroesophageal junction (GEJ) adenocarcinoma.This indication is approved under accelerated approval based on tumor response rate and durability of response. Continued approval for this indication may be contingent upon verification and description of clinical benefit in the confirmatory trials.See additional selected KEYTRUDA indications in the U.S. after the Selected Important Safety Information.Selected Important Safety Information for KEYTRUDASevere and Fatal Immune-Mediated Adverse ReactionsKEYTRUDA is a monoclonal antibody that belongs to a class of drugs that bind to either the PD-1 or the PD-L1, blocking the PD-1/PD-L1 pathway, thereby removing inhibition of the immune response, potentially breaking peripheral tolerance and inducing immune-mediated adverse reactions. Immune-mediated adverse reactions, which may be severe or fatal, can occur in any organ system or tissue, can affect more than one body system simultaneously, and can occur at any time after starting treatment or after discontinuation of treatment. Important immune-mediated adverse reactions listed here may not include all possible severe and fatal immune-mediated adverse reactions.Monitor patients closely for symptoms and signs that may be clinical manifestations of underlying immune-mediated adverse reactions. Early identification and management are essential to ensure safe use of anti–PD-1/PD-L1 treatments. Evaluate liver enzymes, creatinine, and thyroid function at baseline and periodically during treatment. For patients with TNBC treated with KEYTRUDA in the neoadjuvant setting, monitor blood cortisol at baseline, prior to surgery, and as clinically indicated. In cases of suspected immune-mediated adverse reactions, initiate appropriate workup to exclude alternative etiologies, including infection. Institute medical management promptly, including specialty consultation as appropriate.Withhold or permanently discontinue KEYTRUDA depending on severity of the immune-mediated adverse reaction. In general, if KEYTRUDA requires interruption or discontinuation, administer systemic corticosteroid therapy (1 to 2 mg/kg/day prednisone or equivalent) until improvement to Grade 1 or less. Upon improvement to Grade 1 or less, initiate corticosteroid taper and continue to taper over at least 1 month. Consider administration of other systemic immunosuppressants in patients whose adverse reactions are not controlled with corticosteroid therapy.Immune-Mediated PneumonitisKEYTRUDA can cause immune-mediated pneumonitis. The incidence is higher in patients who have received prior thoracic radiation. Immune-mediated pneumonitis occurred in 3.4% (94/2799) of patients receiving KEYTRUDA, including fatal (0.1%), Grade 4 (0.3%), Grade 3 (0.9%), and Grade 2 (1.3%) reactions. Systemic corticosteroids were required in 67% (63/94) of patients. Pneumonitis led to permanent discontinuation of KEYTRUDA in 1.3% (36) and withholding in 0.9% (26) of patients. All patients who were withheld reinitiated KEYTRUDA after symptom improvement; of these, 23% had recurrence. Pneumonitis resolved in 59% of the 94 patients.Pneumonitis occurred in 8% (31/389) of adult patients with cHL receiving KEYTRUDA as a single agent, including Grades 3-4 in 2.3% of patients. Patients received high-dose corticosteroids for a median duration of 10 days (range: 2 days to 53 months). Pneumonitis rates were similar in patients with and without prior thoracic radiation. Pneumonitis led to discontinuation of KEYTRUDA in 5.4% (21) of patients. Of the patients who developed pneumonitis, 42% interrupted KEYTRUDA, 68% discontinued KEYTRUDA, and 77% had resolution.Pneumonitis occurred in 7% (41/580) of adult patients with resected NSCLC who received KEYTRUDA as a single agent for adjuvant treatment of NSCLC, including fatal (0.2%), Grade 4 (0.3%), and Grade 3 (1%) adverse reactions. Patients received high-dose corticosteroids for a median duration of 10 days (range: 1 day to 2.3 months). Pneumonitis led to discontinuation of KEYTRUDA in 26 (4.5%) of patients. Of the patients who developed pneumonitis, 54% interrupted KEYTRUDA, 63% discontinued KEYTRUDA, and 71% had resolution.Immune-Mediated ColitisKEYTRUDA can cause immune-mediated colitis, which may present with diarrhea. Cytomegalovirus infection/reactivation has been reported in patients with corticosteroid-refractory immune-mediated colitis.

This company, which is in the Zacks Industrial Automation and Robotics industry, shows potential for another earnings beat.This industrial equipment and software maker has an established record of topping earnings estimates, especially when looking at the previous two reports. The company boasts an average surprise for the past two quarters of 25.40%.For the last reported quarter, Rockwell Automation came out with earnings of $3.01 per share versus the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.62 per share, representing a surprise of 14.89%. For the previous quarter, the company was expected to post earnings of $1.81 per share and it actually produced earnings of $2.46 per share, delivering a surprise of 35.91%.For Rockwell Automation, estimates have been trending higher, thanks in part to this earnings surprise history. And when you look at the stock's positive Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction), it's a great indicator of a future earnings beat, especially when combined with its solid Zacks Rank.Our research shows that stocks with the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time. In other words, if you have 10 stocks with this combination, the number of stocks that beat the consensus estimate could be as high as seven.The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is related to change. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Story continuesRockwell Automation has an Earnings ESP of +0.31% at the moment, suggesting that analysts have grown bullish on its near-term earnings potential. When you combine this positive Earnings ESP with the stock's Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), it shows that another beat is possibly around the corner. The company's next earnings report is expected to be released on August 1, 2023.When the Earnings ESP comes up negative, investors should note that this will reduce the predictive power of the metric. But, a negative value is not indicative of a stock's earnings miss.Many companies end up beating the consensus EPS estimate, but that may not be the sole basis for their stocks moving higher.

In addition, Zacks Equity Research provides analysis on The Boeing Company BA, L3Harris Technologies LHX and Embraer SA ERJ.Here is a synopsis of all five stocks.Bull of the Day:I last profiled Cadence Design Systems in late March, right before the AI-propelled moonshot of NVIDIA shares from $250 to $475.The reason this is important is that NVIDIA , the ""King of AI"" with GPU computing, is a big Cadence customer and partner in the design and simulation of semiconductor architectures.If you are reading this before Monday afternoon July 24, you still have time to buy Cadence near $240 before it goes higher on what I expect will be another beat-and-raise quarterly report.What Hath ChatGPT Wrought?In a special report on ChatGPT for Zacks Confidential members in March, I reiterated why NVIDIA was so important to computing -- even before the ""chatterbot that ate the internet"" became all the rage.And I also recommended investors buy the only meaningful competitor for Cadence -- another electronic design automation (EDA) wizard called Synopsys -- since I already owned both NVDA and CDNS in my TAZR Trader portfolio.Investors could have bought NVDA under $260, SNPS under $375, and CDNS near $200 in late March. You can find that report at this link or by emailing Ultimate@Zacks.com. Tell 'em Cooker sent you.ChatGPT: Time to Become An AI ConversationalistHere was the summary of my reco...Buy Synopsys: This is half of a ""duopoly"" in semiconductor software EDA (electronic design automation) and SDE (system design enablement). My NVDA investors already know that I am heavily invested in Cadence, which is the ""other half"" and a Zacks #1 Rank, because it is a key R&amp;D partner for NVIDIA simulation and design. Synopsys offers a full suite of products used in the logic synthesis and functional verification phases of chip design, including a broad array of reusable design building blocks. Shares are cheaper on a relative basis to Candence -- on both EPS and price/sales metrics -- and the stock is poised to break out above $400.Story continuesAnd here's what I wrote in my March 29 Bull of the Day feature on CDNS...Cadence is one of my favorite ""stealth"" semiconductor stocks -- and even more so with the explosion of use cases for AI tools like ChatGPT, the Generative Pretraining Transformer model that has taken 2023 by storm.Cadence is at least a fifth-gen CAD/CAM software platform that allows semiconductor manufacturers to design and simulate myriad possibilities in the intricate and microscopic architecture of sub-10 nanometer integrated circuitry.Why Buy Cadence Now?NVIDIA is a Cadence customer precisely because Jensen Huang and his teams of engineers are highly focused on simulating all facets of their chip design and testing.Huang and his top engineering teams don't want to send any designs to the chip foundry that haven't been fully simulated under all parameters that are demanded from the world's top GPU ""cards"" -- that go by the thousands into DGX supercomputer systems and sell for $10,000 to $20,000 each depending on the generation and complexity.It was only a few years ago that Jensen &amp; Co. were building a supercomputer for Tesla with 5,700 GPUs that could execute 1.8 exaFLOPS (a quintillion floating point operations per second). Those Volta gen cards only had 21 billion transistors and were deployed to help Tesla with the ""massively parallel architectures"" needed to harness the data demands of Full Self-Driving (FSD) technology.Tesla engineers have now learned enough about AI computing that Elon Musk is building their own in-house supercomputer and may not need NVIDIA GPUs anymore (but I doubt it).Because now that NVIDIA leads the dive under 5-nanometer architectures, their new Ampere and Grace Hopper chip sets can contain anywhere from 50 to 80 billion transistors -- in the space of a shoebox. This is to say nothing of the NVIDIA ""CUDA"" stack of hardware + software. CUDA stands for Compute Unified Device Architecture.To learn more about how NVIDIA drives the AI revolution with their GPU-CUDA engines for machine learning and deep learning -- that a 10-fold stack of global corporations suddenly realized they needed -- see this recent video and article...Nvidia DGX: Workhorse of AI Will Drive NVDA to $2 TrillionCadence Wins as an Arms Dealer in the Nanometer WarsThrough its Intelligent System Design strategy, the company offers software, hardware, services and reusable IC (integrated circuit) design blocks to electronic systems and semiconductor customers.Cadence's core EDA software and services enable engineers to develop different types of ICs. Its design IPs are directly integrated into the ICs.Besides the fact that CDNS is like a planet orbiting the star of NVDA, more Wall Street analysts are finally waking up to the importance of what Cadence calls ""Intelligent System Design.""Stifel Nicolaus semi analysts upgraded CDNS from Hold to Buy this past week and launched their price target on shares from $210 to $300.The Stifel team titled their report ""AI is Likely to Drive a Virtuous Cycle for EDA.""That's an understatement. Here's what I highlighted over two years ago when I first saw NVIDIA CEO Jensen Huang feature Cadence in a virtual keynote he gave...Nexus of Software and Industrial DesignThe software to design semiconductors has become ever more important for at least 3 reasons...First, transistor architecture has slipped to sub-microscopic levels under 10 nanometers, smaller than the coronavirus.Second, the proliferation of applications in autos, mobile, home, factory, and datacenter are accelerating demand and custom solutions for OEMs.Third, the engineering, testing and simulation of these ultra-miniature designs are critical before they are shipped to a chip foundry, or ""fab.""(end of notes from April '21)As if being a major intelligent planet orbiting the stellar NVDA wasn't enough, Cadence is embedded in other key partnerships with Taiwan Semiconductor, the giant chip foundry, and Microsoft, the giant engine of ChatGPT, to accelerate the physical verification of digital designsThe collaborations will help minimize design schedules and compute costs using the Cadence Pegasus Physical Verification System. Considering designers are always under pressure to meet design schedules and compute budgets, any procedural improvements are enabled to progress more efficiently -- and profitability.Announced in April, this new system should optimize CPU usage to decrease cloud computing costs by as much as 20%.What to Listen for on Earnings CallCadence has many products, growth initiatives and strategies that are too in-depth to explain here. So let me just share some of these pivot points that analysts may focus on...Cadence is expected to benefit from secular trends like 5G, rising hyperscale computer consumption at the enterprise level, and emerging AI/ML technologies, which are all fueling digital transformation across various end markets and accelerating demand for advanced semiconductor chips.The company's System Design and Analysis division is likely to have benefited from its growing presence in industries like 5G, aerospace &amp; defense, wireless and communications.Frequent product launches and strong uptake of the company's existing solutions like Palladium Z2 and Protium X2 systems, Cerebrus, Clarity 3D Transient Solver, Sigrity-X, and Xcelium Logic are likely to have driven the second-quarter performance.The launch of Virtuoso Studio and Allegro X AI is anticipated to have helped the company tap the growing demand for generative AI solutions in the digital, verification and systems arenas.What About the Valuation?Besides the Stifel team upgrade, there were other notable moves in the past few weeks before Monday's quarterly earnings report...KeyBanc: Cadence Design price target raised to $265 from $235Wells Fargo: Cadence Design price target raised to $270 from $250With current sales projections of $4.5 billion next year (10% growth), the stock price-to-sales valuation is very rich at 16.5 times. So, it's possible that these analysts have been somewhat reluctant to jump on the NVDA starship and are simply motivated now by FOMO in case Cadence delivers another big beat-and-raise.So, they don't want to be caught flat-footed. But I think that with any key satellite of a new star like NVDA, it takes time for institutional investors to accept this kind of valuation.And so most of Wall Street is still catching up to a software innovator they didn't see coming. I say to investors that you can still hitch your wagon to the NVIDIA star.Bear of the Day:Ligand Pharmaceuticals is a $1 billion operator of bio-pharmaceutical acquisitions and development. The San Diego company focuses on developing or acquiring royalty revenue generating bio-pharma assets.Ligand’s Captisol formulation technology has allowed it to enter into several licensing deals and generate royalties.Captisol is a well-validated chemically modified cyclodextrin that is designed to improve safety and solubility, stability, and bioavailability or lessen the volatility, irritation, smell or taste of drugs.The Captisol drug formulation platform technology was added to Ligand’s technology portfolio following its 2011 merger with CyDex.In January 2016, Ligand acquired OMT, Inc., (Open Monoclonal Technology) for about $178 million. Other technology platforms at Ligand include an antigen discovery platform and a protein expression platform.All these technologies including Captisol have created a strong platform for Ligand to seek new licenses and partnerships. Ligand has partnership agreements with leading healthcare companies like Novartis, Amgen, Merck, Pfizer, Celgene, Gilead and Lilly among others.The company continues to buy smaller companies to increase and leverage its technology platforms. In November 2022, the company completed the separation of its OmniAb business, into a separate public company named OmniAb (OABI). Following the completion of spin-off, Ligand’s shareholders own 85% of this new company. In 2022, Ligand recognized total revenues of $196.2 million, down 18.76% year over year. The company derived around 53% of revenues from Captisol sales. Royalties contributed about 37% to total revenues while Contract revenues contributed almost 10% in 2022.Why Ligand Is a Zacks #5 RankFor the current year, Ligand revenues are expected to drop 36% to $140 million.And while revenues are projected to rebound next year, EPS is projected to decline by over 10%.This speaks to the volatility of a business model dependent on new biotech M&amp;A and royalty licensing.A trough in earnings may be coming for Ligand in their next quarterly report in mid-August. But until then, investors should be cautious. The Zacks Rank will let you know.Additional content:Will Abnormal 787 Costs Impact Boeing's (BA) Q2 Earnings?The Boeing Company is set to release second-quarter 2023 results on Jul 26, before the opening bell.In the last reported quarter, the company incurred a loss of $1.27 per share, which came in much wider than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of a loss of 98 cents. Solid commercial delivery figures, along with robust aftermarket services trend, are likely to have boosted Boeing’s second-quarter earnings. Yet, abnormal costs associated with 787 might adversely impact its overall quarterly results.Solid Commercial Deliveries to Aid ResultsBoeing’s second-quarter deliveries reflect a solid 12.4% surge in commercial shipments from the year-ago quarter’s reported figure. However, defense shipments declined 5% year over year.For manufacturing companies like Boeing, successful deliveries of finished products play a crucial role in boosting revenue growth. Therefore, such a significant improvement in the jet maker’s deliveries for its commercial segment is expected to benefit its overall second-quarter results.The Boeing Company price-eps-surprise | The Boeing Company QuoteWhile the jet giant’s military business revenues accounted for almost 35% of its total revenues as of 2022-end, the commercial business contributed 39%. Therefore, improvement in Boeing’s commercial shipment is likely to have outweighed the decline in defense shipment, thereby aiding its overall top-line performance.Expectations for BGSWe remain optimistic about Boeing Global Services (BGS) unit’s second-quarter performance. Notably, steadily growing domestic and international air travel are expected to have bolstered fleet utilization, thereby boosting aftermarket commercial jet services in the second quarter of 2023. Meanwhile all 737 Max operators having returned to flying this jet as of Mar 31, 2023, must have also bolstered aftermarket services revenue for Boeing in the soon to be reported quarter.This, along with several BA converted freighter and materials management agreements in the recent past, is likely to have added an impetus to BGS’ second-quarter revenues.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the unit’s revenues is pegged at $4,571 million, indicating an improvement of 6.4% from the year-ago quarter’s reported number.The consensus mark for earnings is pinned at $753.7 million, indicating growth of 3.5% from the prior-year quarter’s level.Cash Flow ProjectionsHigher jet deliveries, especially that of 737 aircraft in the past couple of quarters, along with the recent strong order activity and increased aftermarket services, are expected to have contributed to Boeing’s second-quarter cash flow reserve.Q2 ExpectationsConsidering the aforementioned discussion, we remain optimistic about BA’s overall second-quarter revenue and earnings performance. However, expected abnormal costs in relation to the 787 program, along with periodic expenses, might have had an adverse impact on its bottom line.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Boeing’s total revenues is pegged at $18.46 billion, implying a 10.7% improvement from the prior-year period’s reported figure. The bottom-line estimate is pinned at a loss of 99 cents per share, indicating a significant deterioration from the year-ago quarter’s reported loss of 37 cents.What the Zacks Model UnveilsOur proven model does not conclusively predict an earnings beat for Boeing this time around. The combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) increases the chances of an earnings beat. However, this is not the case for BA.Boeing has an Earnings ESP of -1.45% and a Zacks Rank #3.

154,a4e5da0f-1b9d-3e85-9976-b1806263101f,ILMN,2023-07-22,FTC and DOJ reveal new merger guidelines,Yahoo Finance Video,https://finance.yahoo.com/video/ftc-doj-reveal-merger-guidelines-163945163.html,1689957585,VIDEO,"['ILMN', 'ATVI', 'MSFT']","[The Federal Trade Commission and the Department of Justice have released new draft guidelines for how they will evaluate mergers. There is a public will have until September 18 to comment on the proposals. Jonathan Kanter, Assistant Attorney General for the Justice Department's Antitrust Division, tells Yahoo Finance Live that the ""guidelines help provide transparency"" about how the law is applied. Addressing criticism that the guidelines may impact some industries more than others, Kanter says the guidelines ""are business-model agnostic, they don't focus on any specific companies or any specific businesses. It simply says we want to protect and preserve competition.""Video Transcript[AUDIO LOGO]- A US court ruling allowing the $69 billion Microsoft-Activision merger deal to proceed was a big blow for the FTC last week. The agency's antitrust push and its focus on big tech specifically has been no secret. Today, it paused its in-house trial against that acquisition, opening the door to settlement talks. It's not just tech, though, the Department of Justice and the Federal Trade Commission have both taken on companies and industries from airlines to publishing and national security.Last year's high profile battle over Illumina's purchase of Grail ultimately landed in the FTC's favor, but only after an appeals process. In that case, the Commission said the deal would, quote, ""diminish innovation in the US market."" All right. Well, protecting this innovation is key for both agencies. Now, the FTC and the Department of Justice have released a draft update on merger guidelines. It will be used to guide its review of deals and determine their compliance with federal antitrust laws.FTC chair, Lina Khan, has faced strong criticism from Republicans for the agency's sweeping antitrust agenda under her leadership. Speaking on the guidelines, she says, quote, ""Open, competitive, resilient markets have been a bedrock of America's economic success and dynamism. Faithful and vigorous enforcement of the antitrust laws is key to maintaining that success."" End quote.Story continuesNow begins the process of public review before they are finalized. Joining us now with insight, Jonathan Kanter, assistant attorney general of the Department of Justice Antitrust Division. Thank you so much for joining us this morning. So let's get into these regulations. And we have a public review period up until September, correct?JONATHAN KANTER: That is correct. So because of the-- first of all, thank you so much for having me. It's wonderful to be with you all today. The importance of these guidelines is so significant that we have set forth a longer than usual process for public comment-- so it will be 60 days. And that will expire at the end of September, and we're extremely eager for input from the general public, all stakeholders.RACHELLE AKUFFO: And Jonathan, Rachelle here. I'm looking at the guidelines here, the 13 guidelines. In terms of the ones that are the most significant changes that people should be aware of, especially given the success rate of the FTC in trying to address some of these mergers, what do you think are the key standouts among those?- Yeah. So we built these guidelines-- first of all, let me say very clearly that these guidelines are not the law. The law has not changed. The law was written by Congress. It's been interpreted by courts, including the Supreme Court. And we built the guidelines and we designed them to provide transparency regarding our agency practice in a way that reflects the law.So we-- these are the first guidelines ever since they started in 1968 to cite to cases, and we do so extensively to binding and relevant precedents, including from the Supreme Court because our merger enforcement, our antitrust enforcement is law enforcement and we want to be guided by the law.JULIE HYMAN: So I guess-- it's Julie here, Jonathan. I guess I'm trying to understand then how you use the guidelines, right? If the law exists, then what do the guidelines do?- Yeah, so the guidelines help provide transparency about how we apply the law. So as the agencies, we have to get filings. When parties want to merge, they submit filings to the Antitrust Division and the Federal Trade Commission. We examine those filings to determine if the merger will substantially lessen competition or tend to create a monopoly. That involves an in-depth process sometimes.More often than not, we don't have anything to say about it at all, and most mergers go through without any investigation at all. But in some instances, if mergers threaten competition, we have the opportunity to investigate. And these guidelines explain how we go about applying our legal framework to the market realities of today and focusing on the realities of how markets actually function here in 2013-- sorry 2023.- It's OK, you went back in time a decade. All right. But one of those mergers that was high-- that was in focus was the FTC had sued to block this, the Microsoft-Activision deal, it's proceeding. You know, are these rules to follow up with what Julie was asking, is this just lip service?- Not at all. So first, let me say it's-- these guidelines are forward-looking in nature. They don't relate to any specific case. The case you mentioned is pending over at the Federal Trade Commission, and I defer to my colleagues over there regarding the specifics of that matter. I will say that, you know, we've seen a great deal of success in our enforcement program. We've challenged and succeeded in court in blocking the Penguin Random House Simon &amp; Schuster merger, the American Airlines/JetBlue merger.And when we look at the total number of trial victories plus abandonments either post-litigation or prior to litigation, we've seen success in over 15 transactions. That is, you know, a record that I'm extremely proud of. And one of the things that we do is we follow the facts in the law, and we make sure that we're applying the law using state-of-the-art economics and analytical tools. And that's what we've done in creating these guidelines is we've built them around the legal foundation that courts are going to apply when we bring cases before them.- And Jonathan, obviously, some of these multinational companies here and sometimes you'll see the EU rule a certain way and take a certain lead, how much are these guidelines influenced by some of the actions that you've seen perhaps taken by the EU on some of these merger decisions?- Yeah. So again, I think the law has not changed, right? The law was written by Congress. It was very clear that if a merger risks-- it's a risk assessment, may substantially lessen competition or tend to create a monopoly, then we have the ability to intervene. And that's what we're doing. And so the guidelines are really designed to help explain how that law might apply or how we might go about investigating as part of our agency practice to apply that law.Now, there's an important nuance here, which is that-- and I'll get it right this time-- in 2023, our markets look very different than they did 50 years ago when phones had rotors, or even 15 years ago when most people-- not my dad-- would stop at a gas station to ask for directions. And so--- Nobody's dad, Jonathan.- I know, I know, I know. I'm a dad now, so I'm familiar with that affliction. But I think market realities have changed, and it's important that we're using the state-of-the-art economic analysis to apply the law to how markets actually function. And so when updating these guidelines, we've not only made sure to in our view faithfully and accurately reflect the state of the law, but we've also made sure to faithfully and accurately reflect the state of market realities and economics-- economic analysis that exists here today in 2023.- So there are some criticism that this is political and you are unfairly targeting certain sectors like big tech. What do you say to that?- So I encourage anybody with those criticisms to read our guidelines because what you'll see is they're business-model agnostic. They don't focus on any specific companies or any specific businesses. It simply says we want to protect and preserve competition. It focuses on competition. And in order to protect competition under the law, we have to make sure that we recognize market realities.Market realities today include data, it includes platform technologies. Markets are no longer two-dimensional and vertical or just horizontal, but they're multi-dimensional. And this is not just true for consumer tech or enterprise tech, it's true across our economy, health care, energy, industrials, fintech. It's everywhere. And so it's important that those economic realities are recognized and that when we apply the law, we're doing so, again, with an understanding of how our markets function today.- Jonathan, speaking specifically about Microsoft-Activision, you know, obviously, that was a defeat for the Department and the FTC.- Well, just very clear. That was-- that was an FTC case. It's ongoing and it's Trade Commission, I can't comment on that. But the Department did not have a role in that matter.- OK, because I was going to ask how do you think the approach could have been different, or what exactly is at the heart there that the court disagreed on that perhaps could have been overcome?- Yeah. Again, I shouldn't-- it was an FTC case and it is pending. And so we shouldn't actually there.- Jonathan, let me ask you this. So with the rules, what industries or what kind of mergers does this place tighter scrutiny on?- So this is really, again, designed to be focused on protecting competition across all industries. So we've started our analysis with, how does competition in this market present itself? And we're focusing on the companies that have market power. We're focusing on mergers that create cogs on competition, that create monopoly power, that extend monopoly power.And that can occur in any industry. It can occur-- if you look at our cases, we've focused on book publishing, we've focused on industrials, we're focusing on health care, we're focusing on aviation, and we're focusing on tech. We're focusing on all of it. And so again, these guidelines are really designed to apply across our entire economy and work to the benefit of the competitive process which in our view, really is a benefit to all Americans and American prosperity.- And Jonathan, just quickly, who is pushing for this? Is this perhaps smaller companies-- I mean, are the public really pushing for this?- Yes. We had a public comment process in issuing these guidelines initially to get input on creating them. I think the last time they were drafted in 2010, the comment period generated about 30 or 40 comments. This time, it generated over 5,000. Those comments are not just coming from industry trade associations or Beltway insiders, they're coming from nurses, emergency room physicians, pharmacists, independent grocers, workers, citizens who care about these issues.We are hearing continually from businesses' entrepreneurs that they want the opportunity to start business and they want to do it in the region of their choice, not just in one part of the country or another. We're hearing over and over not just from small companies, but from big companies that they want the opportunity to compete based on the merits of their innovations, their pricing, and their customer service.And so unless you're a monopoly, you actually really do want the opportunity to compete, and you'd be surprised how often we hear from businesses of all shapes and sizes asking us to enforce the law so that we can provide opportunities for companies to compete.- And we'll certainly be keeping an eye on those guidelines and see how many companies actually adhere to them. A big thank you there for taking the time to join us on Yahoo Finance this morning. Jonathan Kanter, assistant attorney general of the Department of Justice's Antitrust Division. Thanks so much.- Thanks for having me. It's great to be here.]"

Accelerated revenues in most of its operating segments are likely to have favored the overall top line. However, higher labor and material costs due to inflation and supply-chain disruptions may have dented the bottom line of the second quarter.Aeronautics Systems’ Sales Expected to be WeakLower volumes from both Manned Aircraft and Autonomous Systems and the Joint Surveillance and Target Attack Radar System are likely to have dampened the second-quarter revenue performance of the Aeronautics Systems segment.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Aeronautics Systems’ second-quarter revenues is pegged at $2,504.9 million, indicating a decline of 1.1% from the year-ago quarter’s reported revenues.Defense Systems’ Revenues to Show StrengthHigher volumes from the Integrated Air and Missile Defense Battle Command System program and the international training program, along with a ramp-up on the 120mm Tank Training ammunition program, are likely to bolster the Defense unit’s revenue performance in the second quarter of 2023.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Defense Systems’ second-quarter revenues is pegged at $1,339.1 million, implying growth of 3.5% from the year-ago quarter’s reported revenues.Mission Systems to Remain RobustHigher sales from the Networked Information Solutions business area, the Surface Electronic Warfare Improvement Program, marine systems programs and infrared countermeasure programs are likely to have contributed to Mission Systems’ revenue performance in the soon-to-be-reported quarter.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Mission System’s second-quarter revenues is pegged at $2,629.2 million, indicating a rise of 4.5% from the year-ago quarter’s reported revenues.Space Systems – a Key Contributor to RevenuesThe Space System business unit’s revenues are likely to have benefited from the ramp-up in development programs in Launch &amp; Strategic Missiles and higher volumes from the Next Generation Interceptor and Ground-based Midcourse Defense Weapon Systems programs.

156,6ba2fe17-62ac-3a46-a9f0-c7bb00f75f2b,NKE,2023-07-22,"NIKE, Inc. (NKE) Is a Trending Stock: Facts to Know Before Betting on It",Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/nike-inc-nke-trending-stock-130012372.html,1689944412,STORY,['NKE'],"[Nike (NKE) is one of the stocks most watched by Zacks.com visitors lately. So, it might be a good idea to review some of the factors that might affect the near-term performance of the stock.Over the past month, shares of this athletic apparel maker have returned -2.7%, compared to the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's +3.4% change. During this period, the Zacks Shoes and Retail Apparel industry, which Nike falls in, has lost 1%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?Although media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.Revisions to Earnings EstimatesRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.Our analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.Nike is expected to post earnings of $0.73 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -21.5%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -29.7%.The consensus earnings estimate of $3.72 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of +15.2%. This estimate has changed -6.3% over the last 30 days.Story continuesFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $4.41 indicates a change of +18.5% from what Nike is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -6.7%.Having a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, Nike is rated Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPSProjected Revenue GrowthEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.For Nike, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $12.98 billion indicates a year-over-year change of +2.3%. For the current and next fiscal years, $53.69 billion and $58.3 billion estimates indicate +4.8% and +8.6% changes, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryNike reported revenues of $12.83 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +4.8%. EPS of $0.66 for the same period compares with $0.90 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $12.59 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +1.83%. The EPS surprise was -1.49%.Over the last four quarters, Nike surpassed consensus EPS estimates three times. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.ValuationNo investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.While comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.The Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.Nike is graded D on this front, indicating that it is trading at a premium to its peers.

This week, executives made it sound like that drama was in the past.""I don’t think there’s any permanent damage done,"" CEO Kenneth Vecchione told analysts after reporting that deposits at the Phoenix-based bank had risen 7% in the second quarter and would likely rise again in the third.Investors liked what they heard, even though profits fell. Western Alliance's stock surged nearly 8% the next day and ended the full week with a 24% gain.Results from scores of regional banks this past week eased any lingering fears that mid-sized financial institutions faced the sort of existential threat that surfaced in the spring when the failures of three sizable banks triggered outflows across the banking system.Deposits were up at most smaller banks, even those that suffered outflows during the first quarter, and investors responded by pushing stocks higher.KBW Nasdaq Regional Bank Index (^KRX), which tracks the performance of the smaller banks, rose 7.3% for the week, its best weekly performance in more than a year. The KBW Nasdaq Bank Index (^BKX), which includes some of the biggest banks, was also up 6.5%.Zions (ZION), a bank based in Salt Lake City, jumped 9% Thursday. Citizens (CFG), of Providence, Rhode Island, was up 6% on the same day. US Bancorp (USB) of Minneapolis also rose 6.5% the day it reported.But the results also showed a number of these banks still face numerous challenges.Most attracted more deposits during the quarter by paying a lot more for them, cutting into a key measure of profitability. Twelve regional lenders revised down their estimates of revenue or lending profits for the rest of the year, including PNC (PNC) and Truist (TFC) as well as Western Alliance and Zions.Many of these same institutions are also bracing for higher capital requirements from the Federal Reserve that could be released as early as next week. Bankers argue that more stringent buffers will make it more challenging for them to earn robust profits in the future and possibly crimp lending.Story continues'Spotting one robin doesn't make it spring'The run-up in bank stocks this week, Odeon Capital analyst Dick Bove said in a note, happened because the values of banks had fallen so far relative to the rest of the market.""There has been no significant shift in the earnings outlook of the group,"" he wrote. In fact, many banks ""are suggesting that investors be cautious in estimating future earnings results.""One such institution is Cincinnati-based Fifth Third (FITB), the nation’s 17th-largest bank. Its deposits rose, but the bank trimmed its full-year forecast range for net interest income. That key figure measures the difference between what banks earn on their loans and what they pay for their deposits.""We're going to always plan around a more conservative outcome because if we're wrong, everybody does well, and if we're right, we're better positioned to deliver stable earnings,"" said CEO Tim Spence.The bank's CFO, James Leonard, told analysts that ""our June, like everyone else's, was quite strong,"" but ""spotting one robin doesn't make it spring. And therefore, we're going to continue to be cautious in the outlook and play defense in this environment.""A Fifth Third branch in Boca Raton, Fla. REUTERS/Joe Skipper (Joe Skipper / reuters)The outlook for regional bank stocks in the near term ""really isn’t that good"" based on the fundamentals, according to Matt Maley, Miller Tabak's chief market strategist.""Lending has gone down,"" Maley said. ""Where are they going to make money?""Chris McGratty, head of US bank research with Keefe, Bruyette &amp; Woods, noted that ""the stocks have done better because expectations were really really low,"" admitting that his team had ""taken a pretty good hatchet"" to future earnings estimates ahead of this past week.He also noted the technical contribution to the week's rally. Short sellers were forced to buy $469 million worth of bank stocks over the past seven days to cover their positions, according to data from market analytics firm S3.The boost contributed most to the stocks of US Bancorp, Zions, and Cleveland-based KeyCorp (KEY), according to the data.""There’s been a lot of short covering,"" McGratty said, adding that ""when things appear less bad, that can kick up the animal spirits.""Retail investors were part of the week's action, too. On Wednesday, during the rally's peak, regional bank stocks saw average daily inflows that were three times what was received in the past two weeks, according to data from market analytics firm Vanda.""It looks like retail traders took the good news around deposits in stride and decided to chase rather than sell some of these regional names,"" Marco Iachini, Vanda's senior vice president of research, told Yahoo Finance.Click here for the latest stock market news and in-depth analysis, including events that move stocksRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance]"

I would like to remind you that during this call, we will be making forward-looking statements, although actual results may differ materially. We encourage you to review the disclaimer in our press release or the slide deck on Slide 2 dealing with forward-looking information and the presentation of non-GAAP measures, which applies equally to statements made during this call.A copy of the earnings release, as well as the slide deck are available on zionsbancorporation.com. For our agenda today, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Harris Simmons, will provide opening remarks. Following Harris' comments, Paul Burdiss, our Chief Financial Officer, will review our financial results. Also with us today are Scott McLean, President and Chief Operating Officer, and Keith Maio, Chief Risk Officer. After our prepared remarks, we will hold a question-and-answer session. This call is scheduled for one hour. I will now turn the time over to Harris Simmons.Story continuesHarris Simmons: Thanks very much, Shannon, and we welcome all of you to our call this evening. We're pleased that the environment around the banking industry seems to have stabilized relative to the disruption we saw during the first quarter. One notable outcome across the industry has been the acceleration of deposit pricing. While deposit attrition appears to have been largely transitory, the higher cost of deposits remains. Beginning on Slide 3, we've shown some themes that are particularly applicable to Zions this quarter as well as those that are likely to be prominent over the near-term horizon. Customer deposits were up $2 billion for the quarter. We are grateful, but not surprised that our customers have demonstrated their loyalty and confidence in us.We continue to actively manage our balance sheet in response to changes in interest rate risk. This includes funding mix optimization, changes in our interest rate hedging strategies, and our product portfolio. We're also committed to managing our expenses in relation to a more challenging revenue environment. Our second quarter results reflect a $13 million severance expense related to our objective of flattening expenses over the next year. Our levels of non-performing and criticized assets declined slightly compared to the prior quarter. We experienced $13 million in net charge-offs higher than the first quarter, but well below historic norms and reflective of one-off events rather than portfolio trends. Loss absorbing capital increased and remains healthy, particularly relative to our risk profile.Turning to Slide 4, we've included a summary of quarterly financial results showing a linked quarter comparison with the first quarter of 2023. Circled on the slide, we reported total deposit costs of 127 basis points for the quarter compared with 47 basis points in the first quarter. Period-end customer deposits increased 3.2%. Including the impact of broker deposits, deposit growth was 7.4%. Loan growth has slowed year-to-date relative to 2022 to a moderate annualized pace of growth. Moving to Slide 5. Diluted earnings per share was $1.11. As shown on the right side, we accrued $0.07 per share or $13 million of severance expense. Offsetting that was an equal positive impact from the gain on the sale of a piece of property. These one-time items aside, the largest contributor to the decline in earnings per share was the impact of increased deposit and other funding costs on net interest income.We were successful throughout the quarter in maintaining and growing customer deposits through more competitive pricing, including moving customer deposits from off-balance sheet products to on-balance sheet products. These efforts are reflected in the higher cost of deposits. Paul will discuss this further in his comments. And turning to Slide 6, our second quarter adjusted pre-provision net revenue was $296 million. The linked quarter decline was attributable to the primary factors I've just noted and was slightly down compared to the year-ago quarter. With that high level overview, I'm going to ask Paul Burdiss, our Chief Financial Officer, to provide additional detail related to our financial performance. Paul?Paul Burdiss: Thank you, Harris, and good evening, everyone. I'll begin with a discussion of the components of pre-provision net revenue, or PPNR. Over three-quarters of our revenue is from the balance sheet through net interest income. Slide 7 includes our overview of net interest income and the net interest margin. The chart on the left shows the recent five-quarter trend for both. Net interest income on the bars and the net interest margin in white boxes declined in the second quarter as our cost of funds, including the rates we pay on deposits, reflected the impact of the rising rate environment and more competitive pricing. Additional detail on changes in the net interest margin are outlined on Slide 8. On the left-hand side of this slide, we provided a linked quarter waterfall chart outlining the changes in key components of the net interest margin.Signature, Document, ContractPhoto by Signature Pro on UnsplashThe approximately 100 basis points adverse impact associated with deposits, including both changes in rate and volume, was partially offset by the positive impact of loans, lower borrowing levels, and the increased value of noninterest-bearing funds. As noted on prior calls, we have been more competitive with deposit pricing, a tactic that has accelerated in the second quarter due to increasing depositor sensitivity. Our success in growing customer deposits contributed to reducing the level of borrowed funds as we move through the second quarter, and noninterest-bearing sources of funds continue to serve as a significant contributor to balance sheet profitability. The right-hand chart on this slide shows the net interest margin comparison to the prior-year quarter.Higher rates were reflected in earning asset yields, which contributed an additional 187 basis points to the net interest margin. This combined with a nearly 100 basis point increase in the value of noninterest-bearing funds was almost entirely offset by increased deposit and borrowing costs. Our outlook for net interest income in the second quarter of 2024 is stable to slightly decreasing relative to the second quarter of 2023. Risks and opportunities associated with this outlook include realized loan growth, competition for deposits and the path of interest rates across the yield curve. Moving to noninterest income and revenue on Slide 9. Customer-related noninterest income was $162 million, an increase of 7% versus the prior quarter and 5% versus the prior year.As we have previously noted, we modified our non-sufficient funds and overdraft fee practices near the beginning of the third quarter of 2022, which has reduced our noninterest income by about $3 million per quarter over the past year. Improvement in commercial account fees, including treasury management fees, has allowed us to make up the loss of this revenue. Compared to the first quarter, customer fees grew $11 million, or 7%, due to strengthened loan syndications, interest rate derivative sales and other capital markets activity. Our outlook for customer-related noninterest income for the second quarter of 2024 is moderately increasing relative to the second quarter of 2023. The chart on the right side of this slide includes adjusted revenue, which is the revenue included in adjusted pre-provision net revenue and is used in our efficiency ratio calculation.Adjusted revenue grew 3% from a year ago and decreased by 7% versus the first quarter due to the factors noted previously. Adjusted noninterest expense, shown in the blue bars on Slide 10, decreased 3% from the prior quarter to $494 million. The first quarter typically includes seasonal items such as stock-based compensation for retirement-eligible employees and payroll taxes, and the second quarter, therefore, reflects a decrease due to the lack of those seasonal expenses. Reported expenses at $508 million includes $13 million in severance expense associated with our intent to flatten expenses over the next year. Our outlook for adjusted noninterest expense is stable in the second quarter of 2024 when compared to the second quarter of 2023 and excludes any impact associated with the proposed FDIC special assessment.Slide 11 highlights trends in our average loans and deposits over the past year. On the left side, you can see that loan growth has moderated in the current quarter. Our expectation is that loans will increase slightly in the second quarter of 2024 when compared to the second quarter of 2023. Now turning to deposits on the right side of Slide 11, total deposits had declined for several quarters prior to the current quarter. And while average deposits for the second quarter were down slightly, ending balances grew 7% compared to the end of the first quarter. Customer deposits, excluding broker deposits, grew 3%. As noted previously, our deep customer relationships enabled deposit growth while also bringing new business to the bank. The cost of deposits, shown in the white boxes, increased during the quarter to 127 basis points from 47 basis points in the prior quarter.As measured against the fourth quarter of 2021, the repricing beta on total deposits based on average deposit rates in the second quarter was 25%, and the similar measure for interest-bearing deposits was 43%. On a spot basis, at the end of the second quarter, the total cost of deposits was 1.7% and the interest-bearing deposit yield was 2.8%, bringing the realized deposit betas to 34% for total deposits and 55% for interest-bearing deposits at the end of the second quarter. Earlier, I mentioned the contribution that noninterest-bearing funds has on the net interest margin. Slide 12 shows noninterest-bearing demand deposit volume trends. Although deposit volumes have been declining as more customers move into interest-bearing alternatives, the contribution to the net interest margin and therefore the value of the remaining deposits has increased significantly.Slide 13 provides additional information on deposits, including a stratification by FDIC insurance status. As the chart on the left shows, we reported a notable increase in uninsured deposits throughout 2020 and 2021 and has been previously reported, the level of uninsured deposits has been falling back toward historical levels. During the second quarter, the ratio of insured deposits to total deposits stayed consistent at 55%. The growth in insured deposit balances included both reciprocal deposits and broker deposits. Our loan-to-deposit ratio on the right side is at 77%. To put this in historical context, total deposits are up 32% -- I'm sorry, total deposits are up 30%, or 22% excluding broker deposits, since the end of 2019. Moving to Slide 14, our investment portfolio exists primarily to be a ready storehouse of funds to absorb client-driven balance sheet changes.On this slide, we show our securities and money market investment portfolios over the last five quarters. The size of the investment portfolio declined versus the previous quarter, but as a percent of earning assets, it remains larger than it was immediately preceding the pandemic. This portfolio continues to behave as expected. Principal and prepayment-related cash flows were over $900 million in the second quarter. With this somewhat predictable portfolio cash flow, we anticipate that money market and investment securities balances combined will continue to decline over the near term, which will in turn be a source of funds for the rest of the balance sheet. The duration of the investment portfolio is slightly shorter compared to the prior-year period, estimated at 3.7 years currently versus 4.4 years one year ago.This duration helps to manage the inherent interest rate mismatch between loans and deposits. With loan durations estimated to be 1.8 years and a larger deposit portfolio duration estimated to be about 2.5 years, fixed-term investments are required to bring balance to asset and liability duration. Slide 15 provides information about our interest rate sensitivity. A comparison of our model results to recent actual deposit behavior suggests reduced asset sensitivity, which we are showing on this page with the bars labeled as adjusted deposit assumptions. In light of this change, we are actively managing our asset duration to the emerging liability duration. During the second quarter, $2.5 billion of received-fixed interest rate swaps were canceled and $2.5 billion of pay-fixed interest rate swaps were added.On the right side of this slide, we've included detail on the impact current and implied rates are expected to have on net interest income. As a reminder, we have been using the terms latent interest rate sensitivity and emergent interest rate sensitivity to describe the effects on net interest income of rate changes that have occurred but have yet to be fully reflected in the repricing of financial instruments as well as those expected to occur as implied by the shape of the yield curve. Importantly, earning assets are assumed to remain unchanged in size or composition in these descriptions. These estimates also assume deposit behavior is in line with deposit behavior realized over the past 12 months. Regarding latent sensitivity, the in-place yield curve as of June 30 will work through our net interest income over time.Assuming a funding cost beta based on recent history, we would expect net interest income to decline approximately 4% in the second quarter of 2024 when compared to the second quarter of 2023. Regarding emergent sensitivity, if the June 30, 2023 forward curve -- forward path of interest rates materializes, the emergent sensitivity measure indicates an improvement in net interest income of approximately 1% in addition to the latent sensitivity estimate in the second quarter of 2024 when compared to the second quarter of 2023. As noted previously, our outlook for net interest income for the second quarter of 2024 relative to the second quarter of 2023 is stable to slightly decreasing. Our loss-absorbing capital position is shown on Slide 16. Our capital position is aligned with the bank's risk profile.The CET1 ratio continued to grow in the second quarter to 10.0%. This when combined with the allowance for credit losses compares well to a very low level of ongoing loan net charge-offs. As the macroeconomic environment remains uncertain, we would not expect share repurchases in the third quarter. We expect to maintain strong levels of regulatory capital while managing to a below-average risk profile. On Slide 17, credit quality remains strong with non-performing assets and classified loan levels remaining stable and low. Net charge-offs were 9 basis points of loans for the quarter. Loan losses in the quarter were associated with borrowers that have struggled with idiosyncratic supply chain issues, delays in inventory build and change in customer demand.We do not feel these are indicative of emerging stress in the loan portfolio, which otherwise reflected slightly improving credit measures during the quarter. The allowance for credit losses is 1.25% of loans, a 5 basis point increase over the prior quarter as a result of a somewhat weaker economic forecast. As we know this is a topic of interest, we have included detail around the commercial real estate portfolio, including the CRE office portfolio in the appendix of this presentation beginning on Page 29. CRE represents 23% of our total portfolio with office representing 17% of total CRE, or 4% of the total loan balances. Credit quality measures for this total CRE portfolio remained strong. The office portfolio credit metrics were stable with lower classified and criticized rates when compared to industry trends.There were no losses in the quarter across the CRE portfolio and we expect the CRE portfolio to continue to perform well based on the current economic outlook. Slide 18 summarizes the financial outlook provided over the course of this presentation. As a reminder, this outlook represents our best current estimate for the financial performance in the second quarter of 2024 as compared to the actual results reported for the second quarter of 2023. The quarters in between are subject to normal seasonality.Shannon Drage: This concludes our prepared remarks.

Yahoo Finance Live's Myles Udland and Seana Smith review the environment for financial stocks and how it may not be all ""doom and gloom"" for regional banks based on earnings performances.Video TranscriptSEANA SMITH: And there were certainly a lot of, I guess, worry going into this week at exactly what the banks were going to tell us. And when you compare maybe the results from JP Morgan to the results of Goldman Sachs, obviously, a very different picture, not exactly surprising, something that we did expect going into this earnings season.But when you take into account some of the other banks that we also heard from because regionals and almost seemed like investor sentiment there was it's OK. It's better than expected. Deposit levels look like they have stabilized just a bit. And the market at least right now looking at that as a win.MYLES UDLAND: Yeah. And I know we can take a look at a couple of different regionals. Western Alliance was one of those names that all of a sudden everybody knew that stock. I think we have Western, Zions Bancorp, and KeyBank on this chart. And you look all these names over the last month, up at least 15%. Western Alliance up quite a bit more than that. All of these names higher on the week by more than, I think it's more than 10%. Can't quite make that out there.But we have seen these names move higher on their earnings. And it is funny looking at both the reaction in these stocks and the way that these management teams talked on the call to think that it was only, what, 3 and 1/2 months ago that we were, like, maybe there's another banking crisis. Who could really-- how many more banks will fail.And Western Alliance was certainly one of those names that there was a lot of concern about in the market, the viability of the bank at all. And now you kind of get on the other side of that. I mean, you remember folks coming on the show almost every day saying, there might be a big opportunity here. And, well, here's the opportunity, I guess. You had to really have to hold your nose. But, you know, this is now turning into the kind of story that I think when you x out the unique issues that SVB and others, you can talk yourself into.Story continuesSEANA SMITH: Yeah. No glaring credit issues. It seems like at least that is obviously good news here or enough, I should say, obviously. It's good news. But enough here for investors at least at this point. But they're not out of the woods yet when it comes to the fact that they are being forced to pay more in order to keep those deposits there at a massive disadvantage when you compare many of those regional banks to the current position of those larger banks. And the fact that environment might not change anytime.MYLES UDLAND: Looking at that year to date chart on those names, I think it is fair to say that the old-- because the old story with regional banks is basically, well, if rates go up, it's good because these are more deposit-heavy banks, therefore, they can make more money on the spread, the net interest income, right? And with there not being competition for deposits, the idea is that, well, you can just turn the higher, you know, rate that you can get on a Treasury or whatever and move that right to your bottom line.So I think to some extent, investors may be sleepwalked into this year with this story specifically. And yes, now there is quite a bit of work to do to rightsize that, let's say. But ultimately, you are probably not going to see-- it seems at this point. Look, famous last words, don't clip this. Probably not going to see like 10 more banks fail before the end of this year.SEANA SMITH: I hope you're right.MYLES UDLAND: It feels like that, right?SEANA SMITH: That seems like a pretty safe.MYLES UDLAND: It feels like there will probably be fewer than 10 banks in the US fail for the balance of 2023. That's my big prediction.SEANA SMITH: I'm going to side with you on that one. I think it's fair.]"

162,c48bf1cc-feb0-383c-bc7d-d62dc2bfec84,WFC,2023-07-22,Wells Fargo & Company's (NYSE:WFC) institutional shareholders had a great week as one-year returns increased after a 5.5% gain last week,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/wells-fargo-companys-nyse-wfc-110019900.html,1690023619,STORY,['WFC'],"[Key InsightsInstitutions' substantial holdings in Wells Fargo implies that they have significant influence over the company's share price50% of the business is held by the top 24 shareholders Analyst forecasts along with ownership data serve to give a strong idea about prospects for a businessA look at the shareholders of Wells Fargo &amp; Company (NYSE:WFC) can tell us which group is most powerful. We can see that institutions own the lion's share in the company with 76% ownership. In other words, the group stands to gain the most (or lose the most) from their investment into the company.And as as result, institutional investors reaped the most rewards after the company's stock price gained 5.5% last week. The one-year return on investment is currently 9.4% and last week's gain would have been more than welcomed.Let's delve deeper into each type of owner of Wells Fargo, beginning with the chart below. See our latest analysis for Wells Fargo ownership-breakdownWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Wells Fargo?Institutional investors commonly compare their own returns to the returns of a commonly followed index. So they generally do consider buying larger companies that are included in the relevant benchmark index.Wells Fargo already has institutions on the share registry. Indeed, they own a respectable stake in the company. This suggests some credibility amongst professional investors. But we can't rely on that fact alone since institutions make bad investments sometimes, just like everyone does. It is not uncommon to see a big share price drop if two large institutional investors try to sell out of a stock at the same time. So it is worth checking the past earnings trajectory of Wells Fargo, (below). Of course, keep in mind that there are other factors to consider, too.earnings-and-revenue-growthSince institutional investors own more than half the issued stock, the board will likely have to pay attention to their preferences. Wells Fargo is not owned by hedge funds. Looking at our data, we can see that the largest shareholder is The Vanguard Group, Inc. with 9.1% of shares outstanding. Meanwhile, the second and third largest shareholders, hold 7.4% and 4.4%, of the shares outstanding, respectively.Story continuesLooking at the shareholder registry, we can see that 50% of the ownership is controlled by the top 24 shareholders, meaning that no single shareholder has a majority interest in the ownership.Researching institutional ownership is a good way to gauge and filter a stock's expected performance. The same can be achieved by studying analyst sentiments. There are plenty of analysts covering the stock, so it might be worth seeing what they are forecasting, too.Insider Ownership Of Wells FargoThe definition of an insider can differ slightly between different countries, but members of the board of directors always count. Management ultimately answers to the board. However, it is not uncommon for managers to be executive board members, especially if they are a founder or the CEO.Most consider insider ownership a positive because it can indicate the board is well aligned with other shareholders. However, on some occasions too much power is concentrated within this group.Our most recent data indicates that insiders own less than 1% of Wells Fargo &amp; Company. As it is a large company, we'd only expect insiders to own a small percentage of it. But it's worth noting that they own US$122m worth of shares. It is always good to see at least some insider ownership, but it might be worth checking if those insiders have been selling. General Public OwnershipThe general public, who are usually individual investors, hold a 23% stake in Wells Fargo. This size of ownership, while considerable, may not be enough to change company policy if the decision is not in sync with other large shareholders.Next Steps:I find it very interesting to look at who exactly owns a company. But to truly gain insight, we need to consider other information, too. Case in point: We've spotted   1 warning sign for Wells Fargo  you should be aware of.But ultimately  it is the future, not the past, that will determine how well the owners of this business will do. Therefore we think it advisable to take a look at this free report showing whether analysts are predicting a brighter future.NB: Figures in this article are calculated using data from the last twelve months, which refer to the 12-month period ending on the last date of the month the financial statement is dated.

(AP) — Most of the destruction from a tornado that tore through eastern North Carolina Wednesday and struck a large Pfizer pharmaceutical plant affected its storage facility, rather than its medicine production areas, the company said Friday.The drugmaker’s ability to salvage production equipment and other essential materials could mitigate what experts feared would be a major blow to an already strained system as the United States grapples with existing drug shortages.“We do not expect there to be any immediate significant impacts on supply given the products are currently at hospitals and in the distribution system,” U.S. Food and Drug Administration Commissioner Robert Califf said Friday.An EF3 tornado touched down Wednesday near Rocky Mount, ripping the roof off a Pfizer factory responsible for producing nearly 25% of the American pharmaceutical giant's sterile injectable medicines used in U.S. hospitals, according to the drugmaker.Pfizer said Friday that a warehouse for raw materials, packaging supplies and finished medicines awaiting release had endured most of the damage to its 1.4 million square foot plant. An initial inspection by the company found no major damage to its medicine manufacturing areas, and all 3,200 local employees are safe and accounted for.Pfizer Chairman and CEO Dr. Albert Bourla said staff are rushing products to nearby sites for storage and identifying sources to rapidly replace raw materials lost in the storm. The drug company says it is also exploring alternative manufacturing locations across its U.S. network to fill gaps in production while the North Carolina site remains closed for repairs.The FDA’s initial analysis identified fewer than 10 drugs for which Pfizer’s North Carolina plant is the sole source for the U.S. market, Califf said.The Rocky Mount plant produces anesthesia and many other drugs needed for surgeries but does not make or store Pfizer’s COVID-19 vaccine or the Comirnaty and Paxlovid treatments. Medications produced at that facility alone account for nearly 8% of all sterile injectables used in U.S. hospitals, Pfizer said on its website.Story continuesThe FDA said it will complete in the coming days a more extensive evaluation of the products that might be affected and the current domestic supply of those medications. “Many weeks’ worth” of the destroyed drugs should be available in Pfizer’s other warehouses, Califf said.___Hannah Schoenbaum is a corps member for the Associated Press/Report for America Statehouse News Initiative.

(NYSE: PFE) today announced the company’s immediate efforts to provide relief and repair the damage caused to its manufacturing facility in Rocky Mount, North Carolina after a violent tornado swept through the town on Wednesday, July 19. All 3,200 local Pfizer colleagues reporting to this manufacturing site are safe and accounted for after excellent implementation of the site’s long-standing evacuation plan. Crews are working around-the-clock to restore power, assess the structural integrity of the building and move finished medicines to nearby sites for storage.Pfizer also announced a donation to the American Red Cross North Carolina Chapter and United Way Tar River Region to support the relief and recovery needs. Additionally, the Pfizer Foundation will match employee donations to these organizations.""Clearly nature is strong. So too is ingenuity and the human spirit. A great deal of work needs to be done, but I assure everyone, most importantly the people of the Rocky Mount community, that we will put Pfizer’s full power behind this effort,"" said Dr. Albert Bourla, Chairman and CEO, Pfizer Inc. ""We will work in lockstep with our partners and local authorities to restore and rebuild the site and the community.""The site is closed while the damage is assessed. Pfizer is committed to rapidly restoring full function to the site, which plays a critical role in the U.S. healthcare system. This effort is in close partnership with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration Commissioner Robert Califf, North Carolina Governor Roy Cooper as well as other state, local and federal officials.Story continuesMost of the damage was caused to the warehouse facility, which stores raw materials, packaging supplies, and finished medicines awaiting release by quality assurance. Pfizer is working diligently to move product to other nearby sites for storage and to identify sources to replace damaged raw materials and supplies. Pfizer is also exploring alternative manufacturing locations for production across our significant manufacturing presence in the U.S. and internationally and across the company’s partner network. After an initial assessment, there does not appear to be any major damage to the medicine production areas.Since 1968, the Rocky Mount facility has been a key producer for sterile injectables. Currently, it is responsible for manufacturing nearly 25 percent of all Pfizer’s sterile injectables – including anesthesia, analgesia, therapeutics, anti-infectives and neuromuscular blockers – which is nearly 8 percent of all the sterile injectables used in U.S. hospitals. The site is one of 10 Pfizer manufacturing sites located in the United States.About Pfizer: Breakthroughs That Change Patients’ LivesAt Pfizer, we apply science and our global resources to bring therapies to people that extend and significantly improve their lives.

We again had strength in our growth vectors of software and consulting and solid cash generation, consistent with our financial model. Clients and partners continue to view technology as a source of competitive advantage. Clients turn to us to speed up their transformation journeys, modernize applications and optimize their business workflows. At the same time, they continue to prioritize projects that focus on productivity and deliver quick time to value. To seize this opportunity, we are bringing new innovations to market, expanding strategic partnerships, and making investments in targeted growth markets, while unlocking value through our productivity initiatives.Story continuesAll of this gives us confidence in our ability to achieve our full-year expectations for revenue and free cash flow, which remain our two primary areas of focus. We've made progress in our strategy around hybrid cloud and AI, the two key drivers of business innovation. Hybrid cloud is the most widespread form of IT architecture. Red Hat OpenShift, our leading container platform based on open-source innovations plays a crucial role in making this possible along with IBM software and infrastructure. Our consultants use their technical and business knowledge to speed-up clients' digital transformation journeys and help drive adoption of our technology platforms. Our broad ecosystem of partners amplifies our reach and ability to meet client demand.Let me highlight a few collaborations from this past quarter that take advantage of our platform-centric approach. We're helping Air Canada, improve its digital footprint, including their website, mobile application, and loyalty program. Using a hybrid cloud approach helps Air Canada better connect and tap into their commercial, operational, and financial data. With Diageo, IBM Consulting embarked on a large global digital transformation to improve customer satisfaction, optimize business workflows, and enhance its financial performance reporting capabilities. We also forged a strategic partnership with Nokia, where Red Hat OpenShift becomes the preferred platform provider to Nokia's core network applications business. This past quarter, we made strategic moves to bolster our hybrid cloud and AI capabilities with the announcement of our plans to acquire Apptio, which offer the virtual command center for CEOs, CFOs, and CIOs to manage their technology investments.Apptio’s offerings combined with IBM's IT automation software and our AI capabilities, will give clients the most comprehensive approach to optimize their IT environments. AI is a transformative technology that has the potential to unlock tremendous business value. According to a recent McKinsey study, AI could add up to $4.4 trillion annually to the global economy. Our focus is on enterprise AI, designed to address these opportunities and solve business problems. The list of use cases is long and includes IT operations, code generation, improved automation, customer service, augmenting HR, predictive maintenance, financial forecasting, fraud detection, compliance monitoring, security, sales, risk management, and supply chain amongst others.AI is being infused into our software products. We are already building products that address specific enterprise use cases such as digital labor with Watson Orchestrate, customer service with Watson Assistant, and co-generation with Watson Code Assistant. And our Think Conference in May, we announced what's the next, our enterprise-ready AI and data platform to help clients and partners, capitalize on the AI opportunity. Watsonx delivers the value of foundational models to the enterprise, enabling them to be more productive. We began to rollout watsonx, a little over a week ago and we are excited by the client response. To-date, the platform has been shaped by more than 150 businesses across industries from telco to banking. Businesses around the world are excited about tapping foundation models and machine learning in one place, with their own data to accelerate generative AI workloads.For example, Samsung is exploring generative AI to deliver unprecedented innovation for clients. Citi is pursuing the potential use of large language models for connecting controls to internal processes. NatWest is embedding watsonx into its chatbot to improve customer experience and SAP is integrating IBM Watson AI into their solutions. IBM is also working with an expanding ecosystem of partners to co-create and innovate across industries and use cases from space to sports, including work with NASA to build the first foundation models for analyzing geospatial data and Wimbledon, where watsonx was used to produce tennis commentary. Large language models are a step-change in the evolution of AI, with more than 80% of enterprises exploring their use.We believe the opportunity for large language models for enterprises is immense. Given the existing amount of business data, this includes sensor data, chemistry data, material data, geospatial data, code, and of course, speech. Because enterprise AI draws from both public and private data, it is more effectively trained and companies adopt a hybrid cloud approach. Enterprise AI can also be based on multiple models, including public, private, and open-source. Our watsonx platform takes into account this reality and is differentiated in a few important ways. For instance, instead of relying on a single model watsonx enables companies to leverage the best models to meet their needs, whether they are open-source technologies, IBM's models, or those co-created with us.Another fundamental aspect of watsonx is trust, ensuring transparency and bias free models. In addition, beyond offering companies the capability to tap into existing AI models, IBM empowers them to create their own. To help clients on this journey, we have over 20,000 data and AI consultants and recently launched our new Center of Excellence for generative AI, already staffed with more than a 1,000 consultants with specialized generative AI expertise. The investments we're making in products and skills will help us to seize the AI opportunity. Our path is clear, in the same way we have built a consulting practice around Red Hat's hybrid cloud platform, that is now measured in the billions of dollars, we will do the same with AI. And just like OpenShift is the technology platform at the heart of our hybrid cloud capabilities, watsonx will be the core technology platform for our AI capabilities.Business laptopphoto by Business-laptop-campaign-creators on UnsplashWatsonx is just one of many new technology innovations. Shortly after previewing watsonx at our Think Conference at the Red Hat Summit, we introduced OpenShift AI, which is a unified solution to train, serve, monitor, and manage the lifecycle of AI models and applications. We also unveiled IBM hybrid cloud mesh, a SaaS solution that streamlines application-centric connectivity for edge, hybrid, and multi-cloud environments. To help clients with their sustainability agendas, we launched our AI-powered cloud-based tool that helps clients track their greenhouse gas emissions for cloud workloads. And as an example of how we continue to push the boundaries of innovation, IBM recently demonstrated using error mitigating techniques, quantum computers can produce results at a scale of 100-plus cubits.This is a significant breakthrough that firmly puts us on a path towards building practical quantum computers that can solve hard problems in areas such as risk, finance, and materials. Let me conclude by reiterating our confidence in our strategy and execution. It is clear that the work we have done to better align IBM to the needs of our clients is paying off. The momentum in our business and continued focus on productivity, position us to achieve our full-year expectations and deliver sustainable revenue and free cash flow growth. With that, I would like to hand it over to Jim who will delve deeper into our performance and expectations.Jim Kavanaugh: Thanks, Arvind. As always, I'll start with the key financial highlights of the second quarter. We delivered $15.5 billion in revenue; $2.4 billion of operating pretax income; $2.18 of operating earnings per share and through the first-half nearly $3.5 billion of free cash flow. In the second quarter, we had modest revenue growth at constant currency, and that includes over 1 point of impact from the businesses we divested last year. Currency rates continue to be a headwind to growth with dollar strengthening over the last 90-days; currency impacted our reported revenue growth by 80 basis points, which is about a 0.5 point worse than what spot rates suggested in April. As is typical, I'll focus my comments on constant currency.Revenue performance was again led by software and consulting. These are growth factors that together represent about three quarters of IBM's revenue and contribute to a solid base of recurring revenue and profit. Software revenue was up 8% with good growth across both, hybrid platform and solutions, led by Red Hat and Data &amp; AI and Transaction Processing. IBM Consulting revenue growth of 6% was also broad-based, with growth across all three lines of business and geographies. Our infrastructure revenue in any quarter reflects product cycle dynamics. Infrastructure revenue was down 14%. This, as expected, had a disproportional impact to IBM's overall revenue growth this quarter, given the very successful launch of z16 in the second quarter last year.Looking at the two-year compounded growth rate, infrastructure revenue was up. Turning to our profit metrics, operating gross margin expanded 140 basis points, driven by our portfolio mix and productivity. We had good performance this quarter with gross margin improvements in every reportable segment. Our operating pre-tax margin was down 70 basis points. Last year we had a gain of about $230 million from the sale of our healthcare software assets. Without the year-to-year impact of the divestiture gains, our operating pre-tax margin was up 70 basis points. This is a better indication of our ongoing operational performance. Let me comment on a couple of items within our expense profile that impacted our pre-tax income performance. As we discussed in the last couple of earnings calls, we address the remaining stranded costs from our portfolio actions, resulting in a higher level of workforce rebalancing activity this year, about $115 million in the quarter.Workforce rebalancing impacted our year-to-year pre-tax margin expansion by another 60 basis points. And then currency remained a year-to-year headwind, not only to revenue, but also to our expense and pre-tax profit. The combination of translation and hedging impacted operating pre-tax profit growth by about $150 million and operating PTI margin by about 80 basis points year to year. As I've discussed in the past, this disproportionately impacts our product-based businesses. We have good momentum in our underlying operational profit performance. I mentioned a strong business mix, but we're also making progress on our productivity initiatives. We're digitally transforming IBM as Client Zero simplifying workflows, and deploying AI across our processes.From IT operations to HR to source-to-pay. The productivity benefits free-up spend for reinvestment and contribute to margin expansion. Turning to free cash flow, we generated $2.1 billion in the quarter and nearly $3.5 billion in the first-half. This first-half performance is up over $100 million year-to-year and keeps us on track to our full-year expectation. Growth is driven by the cash from our profit performance, working capital efficiencies, and lower payments for structural actions. This was mitigated by higher performance-based compensation payments, given last year's strong results and higher cash taxes. In terms of cash uses through the first-half, we returned $3 billion to shareholders in the form of dividends and spent about $350 million to acquire six companies.Later this year, we expect to close the acquisition of Apptio, which complements and advances our IT automation capabilities. From a balance sheet perspective, we continue to have very strong liquidity position with over $16 billion of cash that's down over $1 billion since March, and up $7.5 billion since December. Our debt balance at the end of the second quarter was over $57 billion, which is up $6.5 billion from year-end. You'll recall earlier in the year, we were opportunistic in accessing the debt market and issued debt to prudently get ahead of 2023 and 2024 maturities, as well as capital allocation priorities. Turning to the segments, software revenue growth accelerated to 8% this quarter. Both Hybrid Platform &amp; Solutions and Transaction Processing grew, as clients leverage our hybrid cloud and AI platform capabilities.This performance again reflects growth across both our recurring revenue base, which is about 80% of annual software revenue, as well as transactional revenue. In Hybrid Platform &amp; Solutions revenue was up 7%, fueled by growth in Red Hat, Data &amp; AI, and automation. Our Hybrid Platform &amp; Solutions ARR is now over $13.6 billion and up 7%, reflecting the importance of our strategic offerings with our clients. Red Hat revenue grew 11%. OpenShift, our leading hybrid cloud platform grew more than 30% in the quarter and now has $1.1 billion in annual recurring revenue. Ansible also delivered double-digit growth and gained market share this quarter. In automation, revenue was up 2%, reflecting growth across integration, application servers, and business automation.As clients drive enhance business value through productivity and performance optimization. Data &amp; AI revenue was up 11%. The broad-based growth included areas like data management and business analytics, giving enterprise needs for data visualization, organization, analysis, and insights as the underpinnings for AI workloads. Security revenue declined 1%. We delivered growth in security software, driven by data security with Guardium Insights. This was more than offset by declines in security services this quarter. In Transaction Processing, revenue grew 10% off of an easier compare last year. The increase in zSystems installed capacity over the last couple of cycles and strong software renewal rates reflect the importance of zSystems platform in a hybrid cloud environment.These dynamics contributed to both recurring and transactional software revenue opportunity again this quarter. Putting this together with price increases, we had strong performance in transaction processing. Moving to profit for the software segment, our pre-tax margin was up by 0.5 point, while absorbing over 1 point of impact from currency. We delivered operating leverage, given both the revenue scale and mix this quarter. Consulting revenue was up 6%. In April, we discussed that we were seeing sustained demand for larger transformations that delivered meaningful ROI. At the same time, other projects considered to be more discretionary predominantly in the United States. The second quarter client buying behavior played out much in the same way.Our signings were solid, up over 20% with double-digit growth in both large and small engagements. This takes our book-to-bill ratio up to 1.1 over the last 12 months. We address continued demand for technology-driven transformations as clients prioritize projects that drive cost savings and increase productivity. Turning to our lines of business and consulting, growth across our service offerings was broad-based. Business transformation grew 5%, driven by data and technology transformations, including AI and analytics-focused projects. Digital transformations continue to be underpinned by clients embracing a hybrid cloud strategy. Technology consulting grew 5% and application operations grew 8%, as we again saw strength in cloud-based application services across development, modernization, and management.Contributing to growth across the business, our strategic partnerships grew signings and revenue double-digits with solid performance from partnerships with AWS and Azure. Our Red Hat practice also grew signings and revenue double-digits. We have an annualized revenue run rate in excess of $2 billion. Moving to consulting profit, we expanded both gross and pre-tax margins a 180 basis points. Our margin expansion is a reflection of the pricing and productivity actions we've taken, more than offsetting the increased labor costs and investments. Turning to the Infrastructure segment, revenue was down 14%, reflecting product cycle dynamics. This impacted both hybrid infrastructure and infrastructure support. Within hybrid infrastructure, the zSystems revenue declined 30%.We've wrapped on strong revenue performance last year, up 77%, when z16 launched in the seasonally strong quarter. Through the first five quarters of availability, revenue is well ahead of prior cycles. The z16 brings the power of embedded AI at scale, cyber resilience security, and cloud-native development for hybrid cloud to our clients. For example, clients are adopting IBM's z16 and the Telum processor as the foundation for real-time AI insights across significant volumes of data. Distributed infrastructure revenue was down 6%. Let me remind you, we are wrapping on strong growth last year, up 17% driven by strength in Storage and Power10 high-end systems. Moving to infrastructure profit, we expanded gross margins 200 basis points, while pre-tax margin was down 40 basis points, including about 1 point of impact from currency.Now that I've gone through the segment results, let me bring it back up to the IBM level to wrap up. We feel good about our first-half performance, with momentum in our growth vectors of software and consulting and a solid recurring revenue base driven by our high-value software. We're delivering strong gross margin performance, with growth across our segments driven by portfolio mix and productivity. Our overall year-to-year profit dynamics as expected reflect the impact of last year's divestiture. As we look to the full-year of 2023, we're holding our view of the year on our two primary metrics: revenue growth and free cash flow. We see constant-currency revenue growth of 3% to 5% and we expect free cash flow of about $10.5 billion, which I'll remind you is up over $1 billion year-to-year.Let me comment on a few items within these full-year expectations. We expect IBM's operating pre-tax margin to expand by about 0.5 point year-to-year, driven by a combination of product mix and progress on our productivity initiatives. That's consistent with our view 90-days ago and in line with our model. We're also maintaining our view of our tax rate for the year, which is in the mid-to-high teens range. And then finally, while there has been some volatility in currency rates over the last couple of weeks, at current spot rates, currency translation is still expected to be fairly neutral to our revenue growth for the year. I'll remind you that our profit and cash dynamics this year are impacted by the rap on last year's hedging gains, which is about 1 point of headwind to our pre-tax margin expansion.In terms of segment dynamics, in software, we had a good first half and now expect revenue growth at the high end of software's mid-single-digit model. This is all-in including acquisitions. Our revenue growth drives operating leverage with software pre-tax margin expected to expand 1.5 points to 2 points year-to-year. In consulting, we’ve reposition our business to address today's clients' needs. What we saw in the second quarter didn't change our view of the year. We continue to expect consulting revenue growth in the range of 6% to 8%. And to expand consulting pre-tax margin by at least 1 point. And then for infrastructure, as I described in the past, revenue is roughly flat over the mid-term model horizon, with performance in any year reflecting product cycle dynamics.In the second quarter, we have wrapped on the z16 introduction in a seasonally strong quarter. For the year as you expect 2023 infrastructure revenue will decline, impacting IBM's overall revenue growth by over 1 point. We continue to expect pre-tax margin in the low-teens. Our expectations for 2023 reflect a higher-growth, higher-value business with strong cash generation, what we have referred to as today's IBM. The analysts' estimates also reflect these dynamics. And as we look at the third quarter, the average of analysts' estimates looks reasonable. In closing, we are pleased with our first-half performance and it keeps us on track to deliver revenue growth, expand margin and grow free cash flow for the year. I'm happy to provide more color on the quarter and our expectations in the Q&amp;A.Patricia, let's get started.Patricia Murphy: Thank you, Jim. Before we begin the Q&amp;A, I'd like to mention a couple of items. First, supplemental information is provided at the end of the presentation.

174,bff4afe1-5399-3301-9fa2-afc0e894e697,IBM,2023-07-22,We Think International Business Machines (NYSE:IBM) Can Stay On Top Of Its Debt,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/think-international-business-machines-nyse-140028353.html,1689948028,STORY,['IBM'],"[Warren Buffett famously said, 'Volatility is far from synonymous with risk.' So it seems the smart money knows that debt - which is usually involved in bankruptcies - is a very important factor, when you assess how risky a company is. Importantly, International Business Machines Corporation (NYSE:IBM) does carry debt. But should shareholders be worried about its use of debt?When Is Debt A Problem?Debt assists a business until the business has trouble paying it off, either with new capital or with free cash flow. Ultimately, if the company can't fulfill its legal obligations to repay debt, shareholders could walk away with nothing. However, a more usual (but still expensive) situation is where a company must dilute shareholders at a cheap share price simply to get debt under control. Of course, plenty of companies use debt to fund growth, without any negative consequences. The first thing to do when considering how much debt a business uses is to look at its cash and debt together. View our latest analysis for International Business Machines How Much Debt Does International Business Machines Carry?You can click the graphic below for the historical numbers, but it shows that as of June 2023 International Business Machines had US$57.5b of debt, an increase on US$50.2b, over one year. On the flip side, it has US$16.3b in cash leading to net debt of about US$41.2b.debt-equity-history-analysisA Look At International Business Machines' LiabilitiesWe can see from the most recent balance sheet that International Business Machines had liabilities of US$32.5b falling due within a year, and liabilities of US$77.4b due beyond that. On the other hand, it had cash of US$16.3b and US$6.51b worth of receivables due within a year. So its liabilities total US$87.1b more than the combination of its cash and short-term receivables.This deficit is considerable relative to its very significant market capitalization of US$125.7b, so it does suggest shareholders should keep an eye on International Business Machines' use of debt. This suggests shareholders would be heavily diluted if the company needed to shore up its balance sheet in a hurry.Story continuesWe use two main ratios to inform us about debt levels relative to earnings. The first is net debt divided by earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA), while the second is how many times its earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) covers its interest expense (or its interest cover, for short). Thus we consider debt relative to earnings both with and without depreciation and amortization expenses.International Business Machines has a debt to EBITDA ratio of 3.3 and its EBIT covered its interest expense 6.6 times. This suggests that while the debt levels are significant, we'd stop short of calling them problematic. We note that International Business Machines grew its EBIT by 24% in the last year, and that should make it easier to pay down debt, going forward. There's no doubt that we learn most about debt from the balance sheet. But it is future earnings, more than anything, that will determine International Business Machines's ability to maintain a healthy balance sheet going forward. So if you're focused on the future you can check out this free report showing analyst profit forecasts.Finally, while the tax-man may adore accounting profits, lenders only accept cold hard cash. So we always check how much of that EBIT is translated into free cash flow. Happily for any shareholders, International Business Machines actually produced more free cash flow than EBIT over the last three years. That sort of strong cash conversion gets us as excited as the crowd when the beat drops at a Daft Punk concert.Our ViewHappily, International Business Machines's impressive conversion of EBIT to free cash flow implies it has the upper hand on its debt. But truth be told we feel its net debt to EBITDA does undermine this impression a bit. All these things considered, it appears that International Business Machines can comfortably handle its current debt levels. Of course, while this leverage can enhance returns on equity, it does bring more risk, so it's worth keeping an eye on this one. The balance sheet is clearly the area to focus on when you are analysing debt. However, not all investment risk resides within the balance sheet - far from it. For example - International Business Machines has   4 warning signs   we think you should be aware of.When all is said and done, sometimes its easier to focus on companies that don't even need debt.

The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company’s second-quarter revenues is pegged at $11.7 billion, suggesting 3.6% growth from the prior-year quarter’s reported figure.For second-quarter earnings, the consensus mark is pegged at 72 cents, suggesting a 2.9% rise from the year-ago quarter’s reported figure. The consensus mark has moved up by a penny in the past seven days.In the last reported quarter, the leading soft drink behemoth’s earnings beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 4.6%. The company has delivered an earnings surprise of 4.2%, on average, in the trailing four quarters.CocaCola Company (The) Price and EPS Surprise CocaCola Company (The) Price and EPS SurpriseCocaCola Company (The) price-eps-surprise | CocaCola Company (The) QuoteKey Points to NoteCoca-Cola’s performances in recent quarters have been benefiting from strategic transformation and ongoing recovery around the world. The company’s second-quarter performance is expected to have benefited from revenue growth across its operating segments, aided by an improved price/mix and an increase in concentrate sales. Underlying share gains in at-home and away-from-home channels are also expected to have bolstered the performance.The company’s volumes in the second quarter are expected to have benefited from the ongoing recovery in markets. Category-wise, volume has been benefiting from growth in trademark Coca-Cola; sparkling flavors; the nutrition, juice, dairy and plant-based beverages; and hydration, sports, coffee and tea categories.Our model predicts year-over-year organic revenue growth of 7.1% for the second quarter, mainly driven by 7.4% growth of the price/mix, offset by a 0.2% decline in concentrate sales volume. Consequently, reported revenue growth is expected to be 2.9%.Coca-Cola’s second-quarter results are likely to reflect gains from innovations and accelerating digital investments. The company has been witnessing a splurge in e-commerce, with the growth rate of the channel doubling in many countries. KO has been accelerating investments to build strong digital capabilities. It has been consistently strengthening consumer connections and piloting various digital initiatives through fulfillment methods to capture the online demand, which are likely to have boosted second-quarter sales.However, Coca-Cola has been witnessing pressures from higher supply-chain costs, including rising commodity input costs and transportation expenses. The pressures from input cost inflation and other costs are likely to have hurt the company’s performance in the second quarter.Coca-Cola has been investing in its markets and brands to support sales growth, with higher spending on consumer-facing activities. This has led to increased marketing investments in the past few quarters. Rising marketing spending, and growth in short-term incentives and stock-based compensation are expected to have led to increased selling, general and administrative expenses in the second quarter.As a percentage of sales, we expect SG&amp;A expenses to increase 90 basis points to 29.2% in the second quarter.On the last reported quarter’s earnings call, the company expected adverse currency rates to hurt the top and bottom lines in the second quarter. It expects a currency headwind of 3-4% on comparable revenues and 2-3% on comparable earnings per share for the second quarter. Additionally, revenues are expected to reflect a 1% negative impact of acquisitions.Story continuesZacks ModelOur proven model conclusively predicts an earnings beat for Coca-Cola this time around.

KDP is scheduled to release second-quarter 2023 results on Jul 27, before market open. The company is expected to register top and bottom-line growth when it reports second-quarter 2023 numbers.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for KDP’s second-quarter earnings has been unchanged in the past 30 days at 40 cents. The consensus mark for earnings suggests year-over-year growth of 2.6%. The consensus mark for quarterly revenues is pegged at $3.7 billion, indicating 4.1% growth from the year-ago period’s reported number.In the last reported quarter, the company delivered an earnings surprise of 3.03%. KDP has delivered an earnings surprise of 0.3%, on average, in the trailing four quarters.Keurig Dr Pepper, Inc Price and EPS Surprise Keurig Dr Pepper, Inc Price and EPS SurpriseKeurig Dr Pepper, Inc price-eps-surprise | Keurig Dr Pepper, Inc QuoteKey Factors to NoteKeurig Dr Pepper has been witnessing significant pressures from input cost inflation, rising transportation costs and supply-chain disruptions, which have been taking a toll on its performance. These, along with the adverse impacts of higher marketing investment, have been key deterrents.On the last reported quarter’s earnings call, management expected inflation to be the greatest challenge throughout 2023.Driven by the headwinds related to broad-based inflationary pressure and increased marketing investment, the company has been witnessing soft operating margins.Our model predicts the adjusted cost of sales, as a percentage of sales, to expand 20 basis points (bps) year over year to 45.5% in the second quarter. Adjusted SG&amp;A expenses are likely to increase 4.8% year over year to $1,164.9 million, with the SG&amp;A rate expanding 10 bps year over year. As a result, we expect the adjusted operating margin to contract 30 bps in the second quarter.Nonetheless, Keurig Dr Pepper is gaining from continued brand strength, significant pricing actions, solid performance in its cold beverages and strong market share gains. These traits have been boosting the company’s sales performance in recent quarters.KDP has been particularly gaining traction in the Refreshment Beverage segment for quite some time now. Higher net price realization and a rise in volume/mix have been the key contributors to the segment’s growth.The segment has witnessed strong traction from recent innovations, most notably Dr Pepper Strawberries &amp; Cream, effective in-market execution, and its recently announced sales and distribution partnership for C4 Energy. The continuation of this trend is expected to get reflected in the company's bottom line in the to-be-reported quarter.KDP is also witnessing remarkable trends on the market share front. The market share expansion has been mainly driven by strength in CSDs, seltzers, energy, apple juice, coconut waters and fruit drinks. Strength in Dr Pepper, Canada Dry, A&amp;W, Sunkist, Squirt and Crush CSDs, Polar seltzers, Vita Coco, C4 Energy, Mott's, and Hawaiian Punch have also been key contributors.Story continuesWhat the Zacks Model UnveilsOur proven model does not conclusively predict an earnings beat for Keurig Dr Pepper this time around.

181,e6749424-ae35-3434-9e5a-aae2573c61eb,TAP,2023-07-22,4 Stocks Trading Near 52-Week High That Can Climb Further,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/4-stocks-trading-near-52-123700269.html,1689943020,STORY,"['KBH', 'TAP-A', 'PLAY', 'ENS']","[Stocks hitting their 52-week high and delivering consistent performance in the past few quarters offer attractive opportunities to investors while building a portfolio. This is because stocks near that level are perceived to be winners. However, stocks touching a new 52-week high are often predisposed to profit-taking, resulting in pullbacks and trend reversals.Moreover, given the high price, investors often wonder if the stock is overpriced. While the speculations are not absolutely baseless, all stocks hitting a 52-week high are not necessarily overpriced.In fact, investors might lose out on top gainers in an attempt to avoid the steep prices.Stocks such as Molson Coors TAP, Dave &amp; Buster's Entertainment PLAY, Enersys ENS and KB Home KBH are expected to maintain the momentum and keep scaling new highs.  More information on a stock is necessary to understand whether or not there is scope for further upside.Here we discuss a strategy to find the right stocks. The strategy borrows from the basics of momentum investing. This technique bets on “buy high, sell higher.”52-Week High: A Good IndicatorMany a time, stocks hitting a 52-week high fail to scale higher despite having potential. This is because investors fear that the stocks are overvalued and expect the price to crash.In fact, overvaluation is natural for most of these stocks as investors’ focus (or willingness to pay premium) has helped them reach the level. But that does not always indicate an impending decline. Factors such as robust sales, surging profit levels, earnings growth prospects and strategic acquisitions that encouraged investors to bet on these stocks could keep them motivated if there is no tangible negative. In other words, the momentum might continue.Also, when a string of positive developments dominates the market, investors find their under-reaction unwarranted, even if there are no company-specific driving forces.Story continuesSetting the Right FiltersWe ran a screen to zero in on 52-week high stocks (trading near the high level) that hold tremendous upside potential. The screen includes parameters to shortlist stocks with strong earnings growth expectations, sturdy value metrics and price momentum.Moreover, the screen filters stocks that are relatively undervalued compared to their peers, in terms of earnings as well as sales, ensuring the continuation of their rally for some time.Current Price/52 Week High &gt;= .11This is the ratio between the current price and the highest price at which the stock has traded in the past 52 weeks. A value greater than 0.11 implies that the stock is trading within 20% of its 52-week high range.% Change Price – 4 Weeks &gt; 0It ensures that the stock price has moved north over the past four weeks.% Change Price – 12 Weeks &gt; 0This metric guarantees a continued upward price momentum for the stock over the past three months as well.Price/Sales &lt;= XIndMedThe lower, the better.P/E using F(1) Estimate &lt;= XIndMedThis metric measures the amount an investor puts into a company to obtain one dollar of earnings. It narrows down the list of stocks to those that are undervalued compared to the industry.One-Year EPS Growth F(1)/F(0) &gt;= XIndMedThis helps choose stocks that have higher growth rates than the industry. This is a meaningful indicator, as decent earnings growth adds to investor optimism.Zacks Rank =1No screening is complete without the Zacks Rank, which has proved its worth since its inception. It is a fundamental truth that stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) have always managed to brave adversities and beat the market average. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Current Price &gt;= 8This parameter will help screen stocks that are trading at $8 or higher.Volume – 20 days (shares) &gt;= 100000The inclusion of this metric ensures that there is a substantial volume of shares, so trading is easier.Here are four stocks of the 11 stocks that made it through the screen:Molson Coors is a global manufacturer and seller of beer and other beverage products. The company has been benefiting from strength in core brands, as well as the above-premium portfolio. Molson Coors is on track with its revitalization plan focused on achieving sustainable top-line growth by streamlining the organization and reinvesting resources into its brands and capabilities.The company intends to invest in iconic brands and growth opportunities in the above-premium beer space; expand in adjacencies and beyond beer; and create digital competencies for commercial functions, supply-chain-related system capabilities and employees. To facilitate these investments, TAP plans to generate savings of $150 million by simplifying its structure.The company currently sports a Zacks Rank of 1. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for TAP Energy’s 2023 earnings has been revised upward by 1.5% to $4.61 per share in the past 30 days. The company surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate thrice in the trailing four quarters while missing the same on one occasion, the average surprise being 32.06%.Dave &amp; Buster's Entertainment is a leading owner and operator of high-volume venues in North America that combines dining and entertainment for both adults and families. Dave &amp; Buster's continues to pursue a disciplined new store growth strategy in new and existing markets to drive growth.In fiscal 2023, the company intends to open 16 new stores (including 11 Dave &amp; Buster's and 5 Main Event locations) and relocate Dave &amp; Buster's Vernon Hills store. The company recently inked a deal with the Malpani Group to open 15 new stores in India. Also, it partnered with the NightOwl Entertainment Group to open five stores in Australia. These strategic moves mark the company’s second and third multi-store franchise agreements, respectively, in the APAC and MEA regions.The company currently sports a Zacks Rank of 1. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for PLAY’s fiscal 2023 earnings has increased 2.3% to $3.58 per share in the past 30 days. The company surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate thrice in the trailing four quarters while missing the same once, the average surprise being 6.81%.EnerSys engages in manufacturing, marketing and distribution of various industrial batteries. The company is set to benefit from solid product offerings, healthy backlogs and strengthening demand. Strength in broadband, data center and telecom businesses, and favorable pricing actions bode well for the company’s Energy Systems segment. A solid backlog of $1.3 billion at the end of fourth-quarter fiscal 2023, driven by order trends across all business segments is reflective of its opportunities in the near term. Handsome rewards to its shareholders raise the stock's attractiveness.The company currently sports a Zacks Rank of 1. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for ENS’ fiscal 2024 earnings has increased 3.7% to $7.09 per share in the past 30 days. The company surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in all the trailing four quarters, the average surprise being 9.03%.KB Home is a well-known homebuilder in the United States and one of the largest in the state. KBH invests aggressively in land acquisition and development, mainly in high-end locations, critical for community count and top-line growth. This has eventually helped the company in reducing debt. The company’s success in increasing scale and profitability, improving asset efficiency and monetizing deferred tax assets under the Returns-Focused Growth Plan has, in turn, enabled it to generate solid operating cash flow. The company intends to focus on increasing Built-to-Order sales that will, in turn, help it gain sales momentum in 2024.The company currently sports a Zacks Rank of 1. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for KB Home’s 2023 earnings has been revised upward by 19.1% to $6.30 per share in the past 30 days. The company surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate thrice in the trailing four quarters while missing the same on one occasion, the average surprise being 20.66%.Get the rest of the stocks on the list and start putting this and other ideas to the test.

Tom Narayan, RBC Capital Markets Lead Equity Analyst, details whether Tesla is seeing demand issues following planned price cuts, while also looking toward the EV outlook and labor negotiations for competitors Ford, General Motors, and Stellantis.Video Transcript[MUSIC PLAYING]SEANA SMITH: Tesla shares in the red for the week. We're looking at a loss of just over 7%. The stock tanking-- taking a hit after recent price cuts pressured margins in its most recent quarter and that overshadowed beats that Tesla posted on both the top and bottom lines.Here with more on what this means for the EV giant and also what we could expect here from other automakers over the next several weeks. I want to bring in Tom Narayan. He's RBC Capital Markets Equity Analyst, Tom, it's great to see you here.So despite some of the concerns that we're seeing from the Street, you reiterated your outperform rating. You kept your price target of 305. Why aren't you buying into some of the worry that we have seen from others from some of your peers?TOM NARAYAN: Well, I think Tesla is kind of a little different than some of the peers, right? So I think, you know, for Tesla, it's really about the future, like way into the future. Their numbers came in great. It's just that they did say that they're going to be cutting some production in the third quarter.A lot of folks wanted them to blow out of the park and raise the guidance on Model 3 and Model Y production for the year. That's probably not happening. So I think some kind of shortsighted people probably took some money off the table there. But really it's about what Elon said on the call, licensing FSD, that's going to be a game changer. That's the biggest driver really for my 305 price target.- Tom, I'm curious over the course of the last, let's say, 3 or 4 months, what the most common question that you've gotten from clients is on Tesla, specifically. Obviously, the stock we through history has done all kinds of crazy things-- up, down, sideways for all kinds of periods of time.Story continuesBut this year, it feels like when you've seen with the free cash flow. You've seen the delivery numbers. The story feels a little bit different maybe than it did in prior runs. I'm just curious what the reaction has been, what those conversations have been like with your clients.TOM NARAYAN: Yeah. The main questions really have to do with the price cutting. Does that mean that there's a demand problem, right? And I think cutting production in Q3, now, this is planned cutting just to upgrade the production plants. That's all it is. But I think that does add fuel to the fire where people may think, oh, my god, there's a demand problem for Model 3, Model Y.So a lot of folks are wondering, what is the next car in the pipeline? We know it's been speculated. And, you know, Elon has talked about this Model 2 car, which is going to be this lower priced car, high volume car. We're going to start seeing in 2025.So that's really where everyone wants to see. What's the next big car to come out for Tesla? And has, you know, demand waned a little for 3 and Y? We think that's not what's happening. But we are excited about this new car that could be coming in 2025.- And I'm curious what you guys think then of the truck. I enjoyed Elon's color on the call. Was it so far off the hook there's no hook for demand there. Just curious how you think about that forthcoming product.TOM NARAYAN: Yeah. It looks like some pretty strong demand here. If what's indicated in the press and the price point could indicate, you know, trump trouble for some of the Detroit 3 with their electric trucks as far as how they're priced, you know. Because it looks like Cybertruck is going to be priced potentially in the 40 to $50,000 range, you know. And it offers what 500 miles of range and this is all speculated.But if that is the case, this could be a real problem for some of the competitors. I don't know if this is going to be a huge volume maker. I think it's a great market entry for Tesla. And it really showcases the technology that they have.But ultimately, the future of Tesla really rides on the Model 3, Model Y. And then this new Model 2 and what it does, again, with autonomy, FSD licensing it to other OEMs. That's really where I think investors should focus.SEANA SMITH: Now, one of its competitors, Ford obviously maybe already starting to feel some of that pressure lowering the price of its Lightning earlier this week. When it comes to Ford, we'll hear from them next week. Anything that we heard from Tesla signal maybe some of the troubles that we could also see from Ford or are they uniquely positioned, given the fact that they're obviously not as reliant on EVs.TOM NARAYAN: Yeah. I think it's kind of a different story I mean, certainly, you know, actually Ford has actually set themselves up pretty well for the quarter with very low expectations. So I actually think they could do very well. The problem is everybody already knows this. So I think for them, they'll probably beat on the quarter and raise guidance. But I think that's largely expected.People are really looking when it comes to all these legacy automakers on pricing. So even though they may do great this quarter or maybe this year, everyone's looking at 2024 and pricing seems to finally be falling. We're seeing all this price cutting happening. And now I think that's where the focus is.So even though, they may do fine on this next week or when they report results, I think people are going to be looking past that to 2024 and worried about pricing coming down and the impacts that will have.- And then, Tom, finally, I just want to ask you about GM, another legacy automaker, you're looking at the stock right now. It's at 38 bucks. It feels like it's been at 38 bucks my entire life, essentially without, you know, save that one run we saw back in the pandemic. Curious what you make of this story because this is the name back in the spring you were a bit more constructive on.TOM NARAYAN: Yeah. It's tough because I think that there's some great things going on here as well. You have an EV lineup, which should really boost pricing and absorb some of the pricing we're worried about for some of the other legacy companies, you know. Now, you have all these new EVs coming out that are higher priced-- LYRIQ, Celestiq, you know.So the Blazer EV, the Hummer, so all of this should help and it's really exciting. The problem, though, is all of these automakers are about to face the buzzsaw of pricing coming down. It's inevitable. Incentives are going up. Used car price data, I'm sure you saw came down a lot sharply. We're in a disinflationary environment. Volumes are coming back.So in this environment, it's a little tough to be really banging the table. But we do like some aspects of, like, the EVs coming out. Also the fact that they do have AI, right? You do have cruise, the autonomous robotaxi, maybe the interest in AI all of a sudden that we've seen lately, maybe that'll create a halo effect for GM. We'll only see.- Levers management can certainly pull. All right, Tom Narayan, RBC Capital Markets analyst. Have a great weekend. Thanks for joining us.]"

But travel patterns are shifting so often, partly due to work-life changes wrought by the pandemic, that airlines must constantly adapt on booking plane seats and remain cautious in forecasting demand and revenue.That situation can result in lost revenue for the carriers if they guess wrong on the best time to sell seats, while their caution in estimating revenue is taking a toll on their shares as Wall Street interprets that as a sign of slowing consumer demand.American Airlines Chief Financial Officer Devon May attributed the challenge to the difficulty in forecasting demand. For investors, this has raised the risk of confusion.""We're getting better at it, but demand trends are still a little bit different today than they were back in 2019,"" he told Reuters.Worries about future demand were a reason American Airlines' stock fell 6% on Thursday even after it raised its full-year earnings forecast. Investors were concerned the hike was modest following the company's performance in the second quarter, analysts said.American is not alone in this struggle. In March, United Airlines had to change its earnings forecast for the first quarter from a profit to a loss because it overestimated demand for business travel in January and February.In the June quarter, United held back seats for summer travel and made them available closer to the peak travel dates at higher fares in a bid to maximize revenue. It was a risky bet as booking data from the previous quarter had shown customers were booking trips well in advance.United's move paid off, helping it generate record quarterly revenue. The company's chief commercial officer, Andrew Nocella, said that was another sign that seasonal travel patterns have changed.""The summer peak period is more spread out relative to the past,"" he said on Thursday on a conference call.Story continuesAirlines can no longer afford to rely on historical booking data because hybrid or remote work arrangements have allowed customers more flexibility to plan travel, said Henry Harteveldt, founder of travel consultancy Atmosphere Research Group.As a result, airlines are leaning more on artificial intelligence and are hiring data scientists to better align seat sales, ticket pricing and flight scheduling with changing booking trends, he said.Yet airlines face the risk of failing to keep pace with ever-shifting travel patterns and missing financial forecasts.""This is a very difficult path to walk,"" Harteveldt said. ""Airlines are going to take a more conservative view of things.""INVESTOR CAUTIONThat caution is stoking worries among investors, who are not sure travel spending will hold up.Rahul Sen Sharma, co-CEO at financial services firm Indxx, said investors are concerned corporate travel has still not recovered to pre-pandemic levels, making airlines highly reliant on price-sensitive leisure travelers.""The high value customers haven't really come back,"" said Sharma, who tracks airline stocks. ""They're the ones that drive profitability.""Airlines, however, say business travel has changed fundamentally since the pandemic. Delta Air Lines CEO Ed Bastian said while people are not traveling a lot for work, hybrid work arrangements have led to a 50% jump in personal trips versus the pre-pandemic period.American's CFO, May, cited frequent upgrades to the industry's earnings forecasts as evidence that the urge to travel remains strong.""It's a different demand profile than what we've seen in the past,"" he said. ""But our systems are catching up.""Booking trends for international trips have also changed.Delta said Southern Europe's summer travel season is now longer than it used to be, prompting the airline to adjust its network.Delta has extended schedules for its seasonal flights to many European destinations into November and December. It also plans to resume services in February and March instead of April and May.""We're going to have a really great summer,"" Delta President Glen Hauenstein said. ""Our goal is to have a great winter as well. (Reporting by Rajesh Kumar Singh in Chicago Editing by Ben Klayman and Matthew Lewis)]"

Results were aided by upbeat air travel demand and declining fuel costs. Driven by the upbeat air-travel demand scenario, both UAL and AAL lifted their respective earnings per share views for the current year.Allegiant Travel Company ALGT reported impressive traffic numbers for June on the back of buoyant passenger volumes.  Delta Air Lines DAL and partner China Eastern Airlines simplified the baggage check-in procedure for China flights in a passenger-friendly move.Recap of the Past Week’s Most Important Stories1. American Airlines’ second-quarter 2023 earnings (excluding 4 cents from non-recurring items) of $1.92 per share easily beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.58. Results were aided by lower costs and higher revenues. Operating revenues of $14,055 million increased 4.7% year over year. The top line beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $13,736.3 million. Passenger revenues, accounting for 92.3% of the top line, increased to $12,978 million from $12,223 million a year ago, driven by strong air travel demand, mainly on the domestic front. Demand was particularly strong in June on the back of an increase in close-in bookings.Management raised its earnings per share outlook for the current year, driven by rosy air-travel-demand scenario. The company now expects 2023 earnings (on an adjusted basis) in the band of $3-$3.75 per share (earlier view was in the $2.5-$3.5 per share range).

At Allegiant, scheduled traffic (measured in revenue passenger miles) increased 2.3% from the June 2022 levels. Capacity (measured in available seat miles) for scheduled service inched up 2.1% from the June 2022 reading.With the traffic increase outweighing capacity expansion, the load factor (percentage of seats filled by passengers) in May improved 0.2 points to 90.1% from the year-ago period’s levels. For the total system (including scheduled service and fixed fee contract), Allegiant carried 3.7% more passengers in June from the year-ago period’s level.Total departures (scheduled services) increased 2.3% in June from the year-ago levels. However, its average stage length (miles) fell 0.2%. Fuel price per gallon in June is estimated to have been $2.64 compared with $2.58 in May.

Investors think so.,Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/is-the-regional-banking-crisis-really-over-now-investors-think-so-115711905.html,1690027031,STORY,"['TFC', 'USB', 'USB-PR', 'ZION', 'WAL', 'WAL-PA', 'PNC', 'CFG', 'CFG-PD', 'CFG-PE', '^BKX', 'FITB', 'FITBP']","[Four months ago, Western Alliance (WAL) was in the throes of a crisis as depositors fled after the fall of Silicon Valley Bank. This week, executives made it sound like that drama was in the past.""I don’t think there’s any permanent damage done,"" CEO Kenneth Vecchione told analysts after reporting that deposits at the Phoenix-based bank had risen 7% in the second quarter and would likely rise again in the third.Investors liked what they heard, even though profits fell. Western Alliance's stock surged nearly 8% the next day and ended the full week with a 24% gain.Results from scores of regional banks this past week eased any lingering fears that mid-sized financial institutions faced the sort of existential threat that surfaced in the spring when the failures of three sizable banks triggered outflows across the banking system.Deposits were up at most smaller banks, even those that suffered outflows during the first quarter, and investors responded by pushing stocks higher.KBW Nasdaq Regional Bank Index (^KRX), which tracks the performance of the smaller banks, rose 7.3% for the week, its best weekly performance in more than a year. The KBW Nasdaq Bank Index (^BKX), which includes some of the biggest banks, was also up 6.5%.Zions (ZION), a bank based in Salt Lake City, jumped 9% Thursday. Citizens (CFG), of Providence, Rhode Island, was up 6% on the same day. US Bancorp (USB) of Minneapolis also rose 6.5% the day it reported.But the results also showed a number of these banks still face numerous challenges.Most attracted more deposits during the quarter by paying a lot more for them, cutting into a key measure of profitability. Twelve regional lenders revised down their estimates of revenue or lending profits for the rest of the year, including PNC (PNC) and Truist (TFC) as well as Western Alliance and Zions.Many of these same institutions are also bracing for higher capital requirements from the Federal Reserve that could be released as early as next week. Bankers argue that more stringent buffers will make it more challenging for them to earn robust profits in the future and possibly crimp lending.Story continues'Spotting one robin doesn't make it spring'The run-up in bank stocks this week, Odeon Capital analyst Dick Bove said in a note, happened because the values of banks had fallen so far relative to the rest of the market.""There has been no significant shift in the earnings outlook of the group,"" he wrote. In fact, many banks ""are suggesting that investors be cautious in estimating future earnings results.""One such institution is Cincinnati-based Fifth Third (FITB), the nation’s 17th-largest bank. Its deposits rose, but the bank trimmed its full-year forecast range for net interest income. That key figure measures the difference between what banks earn on their loans and what they pay for their deposits.""We're going to always plan around a more conservative outcome because if we're wrong, everybody does well, and if we're right, we're better positioned to deliver stable earnings,"" said CEO Tim Spence.The bank's CFO, James Leonard, told analysts that ""our June, like everyone else's, was quite strong,"" but ""spotting one robin doesn't make it spring. And therefore, we're going to continue to be cautious in the outlook and play defense in this environment.""A Fifth Third branch in Boca Raton, Fla. REUTERS/Joe Skipper (Joe Skipper / reuters)The outlook for regional bank stocks in the near term ""really isn’t that good"" based on the fundamentals, according to Matt Maley, Miller Tabak's chief market strategist.""Lending has gone down,"" Maley said. ""Where are they going to make money?""Chris McGratty, head of US bank research with Keefe, Bruyette &amp; Woods, noted that ""the stocks have done better because expectations were really really low,"" admitting that his team had ""taken a pretty good hatchet"" to future earnings estimates ahead of this past week.He also noted the technical contribution to the week's rally. Short sellers were forced to buy $469 million worth of bank stocks over the past seven days to cover their positions, according to data from market analytics firm S3.The boost contributed most to the stocks of US Bancorp, Zions, and Cleveland-based KeyCorp (KEY), according to the data.""There’s been a lot of short covering,"" McGratty said, adding that ""when things appear less bad, that can kick up the animal spirits.""Retail investors were part of the week's action, too. On Wednesday, during the rally's peak, regional bank stocks saw average daily inflows that were three times what was received in the past two weeks, according to data from market analytics firm Vanda.""It looks like retail traders took the good news around deposits in stride and decided to chase rather than sell some of these regional names,"" Marco Iachini, Vanda's senior vice president of research, told Yahoo Finance.Click here for the latest stock market news and in-depth analysis, including events that move stocksRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance]"

Yahoo Finance Live's Myles Udland and Seana Smith review the environment for financial stocks and how it may not be all ""doom and gloom"" for regional banks based on earnings performances.Video TranscriptSEANA SMITH: And there were certainly a lot of, I guess, worry going into this week at exactly what the banks were going to tell us. And when you compare maybe the results from JP Morgan to the results of Goldman Sachs, obviously, a very different picture, not exactly surprising, something that we did expect going into this earnings season.But when you take into account some of the other banks that we also heard from because regionals and almost seemed like investor sentiment there was it's OK. It's better than expected. Deposit levels look like they have stabilized just a bit. And the market at least right now looking at that as a win.MYLES UDLAND: Yeah. And I know we can take a look at a couple of different regionals. Western Alliance was one of those names that all of a sudden everybody knew that stock. I think we have Western, Zions Bancorp, and KeyBank on this chart. And you look all these names over the last month, up at least 15%. Western Alliance up quite a bit more than that. All of these names higher on the week by more than, I think it's more than 10%. Can't quite make that out there.But we have seen these names move higher on their earnings. And it is funny looking at both the reaction in these stocks and the way that these management teams talked on the call to think that it was only, what, 3 and 1/2 months ago that we were, like, maybe there's another banking crisis. Who could really-- how many more banks will fail.And Western Alliance was certainly one of those names that there was a lot of concern about in the market, the viability of the bank at all. And now you kind of get on the other side of that. I mean, you remember folks coming on the show almost every day saying, there might be a big opportunity here. And, well, here's the opportunity, I guess. You had to really have to hold your nose. But, you know, this is now turning into the kind of story that I think when you x out the unique issues that SVB and others, you can talk yourself into.Story continuesSEANA SMITH: Yeah. No glaring credit issues. It seems like at least that is obviously good news here or enough, I should say, obviously. It's good news. But enough here for investors at least at this point. But they're not out of the woods yet when it comes to the fact that they are being forced to pay more in order to keep those deposits there at a massive disadvantage when you compare many of those regional banks to the current position of those larger banks. And the fact that environment might not change anytime.MYLES UDLAND: Looking at that year to date chart on those names, I think it is fair to say that the old-- because the old story with regional banks is basically, well, if rates go up, it's good because these are more deposit-heavy banks, therefore, they can make more money on the spread, the net interest income, right? And with there not being competition for deposits, the idea is that, well, you can just turn the higher, you know, rate that you can get on a Treasury or whatever and move that right to your bottom line.So I think to some extent, investors may be sleepwalked into this year with this story specifically. And yes, now there is quite a bit of work to do to rightsize that, let's say. But ultimately, you are probably not going to see-- it seems at this point. Look, famous last words, don't clip this. Probably not going to see like 10 more banks fail before the end of this year.SEANA SMITH: I hope you're right.MYLES UDLAND: It feels like that, right?SEANA SMITH: That seems like a pretty safe.MYLES UDLAND: It feels like there will probably be fewer than 10 banks in the US fail for the balance of 2023. That's my big prediction.SEANA SMITH: I'm going to side with you on that one. I think it's fair.]"

The fundamentals of our business were healthy in the second quarter with strong procedure and utilization growth and strong capital placements. Our product operations teams continued to build capacity and deliver in a dynamic supply chain environment as customers increasingly rely upon us for routine use. Our research and development efforts continued to build momentum in the quarter, including positive development milestones for our Intuitive ecosystem including systems, instruments, accessories, digital tools and new indications. Turning first to procedures, growth in the quarter was 22%. Areas of strength included general surgery and gynecology for benign conditions, particularly in the United States.General surgery procedure growth was led by cholecystectomy and hernia repair. Colon and rectal procedure growth was healthy. Global procedure growth was also strong in the quarter led by a recovery in China and continued strength in Japan, Germany and the UK. Ion procedures showed continued strength with 145% growth in Q2 of '23. SP procedure growth was accretive with 40% global growth in the quarter driven by accelerating growth in the United States. On the capital front, we placed 331 systems in Q2 compared with 279 systems in Q2 of last year. Our clinical installed base now stands at 7,900 multi-port da Vinci systems, 435 Ion systems, and 142 single-port da Vinci systems. Overall, our capital placement trends reflected demand for additional capacity in multi-port, strong interest in our Ion system and stable demand for SP as we build our SP indications.System utilization, defined as procedures per installed clinical system per quarter, grew 9% globally year-over-year, reaching a new high as customers adopt a broad mix of procedures on our systems. We believe real world evidence of improvements across the Quadruple Aim from better patient outcomes to surgeon satisfaction and lower total cost to treat per patient episode underpin this increasing utilization. Turning to our finances. Our revenue grew 15% in the quarter. Our capital and operating expenses were within our spend guidance, reflecting continued investments in R&amp;D to support growth of our platforms and digital tools, expansion of our manufacturing and commercial footprints, and capital amortization. We will continue investing in R&amp;D, manufacturing and commercial operations to serve our global markets at industrial scale.These investments are likely to be lumpy over the next couple of years as significant operations expansions and other projects complete. Taking a step back, we've found that the Quadruple Aim is the right North Star for us, focusing on demonstrable improvements to outcomes across specific procedures and patient populations, increasing patient and care team satisfaction and lowering the total cost to treat per patient episode. As electronic medical records have been adopted, we have partnered with our customers to analyze this data. Building real world evidence in big data approaches measure Quadruple Aim improvements within countries, regions and health systems. Compared with our ecosystem investments in training, services and products, and powered by digital tools that can generate actionable intelligence from surgical data, we can help our customers analyze their programs, recommend and support to improve performance and lower total costs.This integrated business system is catalyzing our customers' goal of strong MIS programs by surfacing actionable and measurable steps. Our approach is scalable for us too, working for our da Vinci platforms and for Ion and opening the door to future opportunities. Turning to our ecosystem investments. We're making solid progress extending our offerings to new clinical domains and new regions. For da Vinci multiport, we recently obtained NMPA registration for Xi local production in China. This means our da Vinci Xi will be able to compete for the locally sourced tender subset of the recently released updated national quota. Our da Vinci SP team achieved several milestones recently. We completed patient enrollment for our colorectal and our thoracic IDE trials, continued our first phase of launch of SP in Japan and submitted our CE Mark dossier for SP in Europe.Turning to Ion, our team installed their first Ion system in the UK and initiated first cases. For our digital tools, we have initiated our Phase 1 launch of Case Insights, our name for our computational observer. Case Insights is a tool that works with the da Vinci system and hospital data to build AI models that find correlations between surgical technique, patient populations and surgical outcomes. Our first phase of launch builds on work over the past few years with our clinical research partners to refine objective performance indicators and link them to actionable changes to improve outcomes, shorten training times and improve surgical program efficiency. We think these computational tools can make a significant impact using real world and real time data to improve skills and outcomes and to inform future product and automation opportunities.That said, features can be built quickly, but long-term validation is arduous. With our science driven organization and we'll work through validation pathways in pursuit of long-term success. We do not expect material revenue from Case Insights for the next several quarters. In closing, our core business has momentum, we see a significant long-term opportunity to improve the Quadruple Aim using our integrated ecosystem powered by analytics and we are pacing our investments to catalyze that opportunity. I'll now turn the time over to Jamie, who will take you through our finances in greater detail.Jamie Samath: Good afternoon. I will describe the highlights of our performance on a non-GAAP or pro form a basis. I will also summarize our GAAP performance later in my prepared remarks. A reconciliation between our pro forma and GAAP results is posted on our website. Global procedure growth in Q2 of 22% reflected US procedure growth of 19% and 28% procedure growth outside of the US. Procedures in Q2 benefitted from higher patient admissions as hospitals particularly in the US catch-up with patients whose diagnosis and/or treatment was delayed during the pandemic. Consistent with our comments last quarter, contributions to procedure growth from surgeons new to the da Vinci platform were strong, reflecting both the strength of our training capabilities and an increasing number of graduates of residency and fellowship programs who are trained on da Vinci.Within one of our target procedure areas, bariatric surgery, our growth rate in the US slowed during the quarter. Some customers have indicated that they are seeing increased patient interest in weight loss drugs. It is too early to conclude if the slowing growth is a temporary pause as patients evaluate these new drug therapies or if it is a trend that continues. We believe that during the quarter, da Vinci continued to gain market share in the bariatric surgical market. Our US procedure growth of 28% reflected strength in China, the UK, Germany and Japan. Strong procedure growth in China was driven by a continued recovery from more recent COVID related impacts and a favorable comparison to Q2 last year, which was also impacted by the pandemic.surgical, medicineMaster Video/Shutterstock.comConsistent with our comments last quarter, growth in non-urology procedures outside of the United States was accretive, growing at approximately 35%, driven by increases in colorectal, hysterectomy and thoracic procedures. Turning to other key metrics. In Q2, the installed base of da Vinci systems grew 13% to just over 8,000 systems, driven primarily by demand for additional capacity given procedure growth. Average system utilization grew almost 9% year-over-year reflecting an increasing mix of shorter duration benign procedures in the US and customers prioritizing use of their existing assets given the financial pressures they face. With respect to capital performance, we placed 331 systems in the second quarter, ahead of our expectations.Capital strength in the quarter included a higher number of placements to our distributors and a higher number of multi-system deals in the US relative to recent trends, reflecting in part certain placements accelerated into Q2 from future quarters. Despite Q2 system placements being ahead of our expectations, customers particularly in the US appear to be cautious in their capital spending given ongoing financial pressures. We placed 279 systems in Q2 of last year, which as a reminder, reflected a delay in the shipment of approximately 15 systems from June into July as a result of supply chain challenges we encountered during the quarter. Q2 revenue was $1.8 billion, an increase of 15% year-over-year. On a constant currency basis, second quarter revenue grew approximately 17%.Recurring revenue represented 85% of total revenue as compared 72% for the full year 2019 and grew 20% over last year, driven by procedure growth and an increase in the installed base of systems under operating lease arrangements. Additional revenue statistics and trends are as follows. In the US, we placed 157 systems in the second quarter compared to 150 systems placed last year. Outside the US, we placed 174 systems in Q2 compared with 129 systems last year. Current quarter system placements included 76 into Europe, 33 into Japan and 16 into China, compared with 78 into Europe, 18 into Japan and 15 into China in Q2 of last year. During the quarter, the China National Health Commission published the fourteenth five-year quota of 559 robotic systems.For those systems awarded to our JV under the new quota, we expect a significant majority to be placed in 2024 through 2027. We are seeing increasing participation of local competitors in tender processes under the national quota. In addition, during 2023, we have experienced pricing pressure in China as a result of provincial government policy changes and competition. The dynamics create greater variability in the outlook for our procedure, system placement and revenue performance in China. In Q2, 60 of the 331 systems placed were trading transactions compared to 56 trading transactions in the second quarter of last year. As of the end of Q2, there are approximately 500 SIs remaining in the installed base, of which 97 are in the US. Leasing represented 50% of Q2 placements compared with 42% for both last quarter and last year.In the US, 78% of system placements in Q2 were under operating lease arrangements compared to 59% last quarter. The higher rate of operating leases in the US is primarily driven by an increasing customer preference for our usage-based leasing models in part due to capital budget constraints and continuing financial pressures faced by many of our customers. In addition, some customers are choosing leasing structures to preserve flexibility to upgrade to next generation technology. As a result of these dynamics and the earlier stage of our leasing program with OUS customers, we continue to expect that the proportion of placements under operating leases will increase over time. Q2 system average selling prices were $1.39 million as compared to $1.47 million last quarter.The sequential decrease in system ASPs was primarily driven by a higher mix of ex-placements for purchase deals and geographical mix. We recognized $12 million of lease buyout revenue in the second quarter compared with $24 million last quarter and $23 million in Q2 of 2022. da Vinci instrument and accessory revenue per procedure was approximately $1,840 compared with approximately $1,780 last quarter and $1,900 last year. On a sequential basis, higher I&amp;A per procedure was driven primarily by the I&amp;A price increase we described last quarter and customer ordering patterns. Turning to our Ion platform. In Q2, we placed 59 Ion systems as compared to 41 in Q2 of 2022. Second quarter Ion procedures of approximately 12,700, increased 145% as compared to last year.During the quarter, we placed our first Ion system in the UK market. And in this early phase of our European launch, we are focused on the collection of clinical data in support of our reimbursement strategy. 12 of the systems placed in the second quarter were SP systems compared to 10 systems last quarter. SP procedures grew by 40% and average system utilization growth accelerated from last quarter's 12%, increasing by 14% compared to Q2 of last year. Moving on to the rest of the P&amp;L. Pro forma gross margin for the second quarter was 68.5% compared with 67.2% last quarter and 69.2% last year. Pro forma gross margin was lower than last year primarily due to a higher mix of Ion revenue, which currently carries significantly lower margins as compared to the da Vinci business, and lower system ASP.As we described last quarter, improving product costs and manufacturing efficiency is a priority for our teams over the medium term. Second quarter pro forma operating expenses increased 12% year-over-year driven primarily by increased headcount added throughout last year, higher variable compensation, increased prototype expenses and increased expenses associated with customer training in support of procedure growth. Pro forma operating expenses represented 33% of revenue in Q2 compared to 35% of revenue for the full year 2022, reflecting in part, planned leverage in our enabling functions. Capital expenditures in Q2 were $178 million, primarily comprised of infrastructure investments to expand our facilities footprint and increase manufacturing capacity.Our pro forma effective tax rate for the second quarter was 22.3%, consistent with our expectations. Second quarter pro forma net income was $507 million or $1.42 per share compared with $415 million or $1.14 per share for Q2 of last year. I will now summarize our GAAP results. GAAP net income was $421 million or $1.18 per share for the second quarter of 2023 compared with GAAP net income of $308 million or $0.85 per share for the second quarter of 2022. The adjustments between pro forma and GAAP net income are outlined and quantified on our website and include excess tax benefits associated with employee stock awards, employee stock-based compensation, amortization of intangibles and gains and losses on strategic investments. We ended the quarter with cash and investments of $7.1 billion compared with $6.6 billion last quarter.The sequential increase in cash and investments reflected cash from operating activities, proceeds from employee stock exercises, partially offset by capital expenditures. And with that, I would like to turn it over to Brian who will discuss clinical highlights and provide our updated outlook for 2023.Brian King: Thank you, Jamie. Our overall second quarter procedure growth was 22% year-over-year compared to 14% for the second quarter of 2022 and 26% last quarter. In the US, second quarter 2023 procedure growth was 19% year-over-year compared to 11% for the second quarter of 2022 and 26% last quarter. Q2 growth continued to be driven by strong growth in procedures within general surgery with particular strength in cholecystectomy and hernia repair. Bariatrics growth was healthy in the quarter, but as noted earlier, growth was lower than in prior periods. Outside of the US, second quarter procedure volume grew 28%, compared with 22% for the second quarter of 2022 and 28% last quarter. Second quarter 2023 OUS procedure growth was driven by continued growth in general surgery, primarily from strong growth in colorectal procedures, followed by growth in thoracic procedures.Growth in urology continued to be healthy, led by kidney procedures, along with continued double-digit growth in prostatectomy. In Europe, we experienced strong growth in the UK, Germany and Spain. In all the regions noted, procedure growth was driven by colorectal and hysterectomy procedures. In Asia, growth was led by China, where we saw a continuing recovery in procedures that were impacted by COVID and benefiting from a favorable comparison to procedure volume that was impacted in the same quarter a year ago. Procedure growth was led by strong growth in urology, namely prostatectomy and kidney procedures. In Japan, growth was led by general surgery with the largest procedure contributions coming from colorectal and gastrectomy procedures.While still at earlier stages of adoption, India and Taiwan both demonstrated strong growth in gynecology and general surgery procedures. Now turning to the clinical side of our business. Each quarter on these calls, we highlight certain recently published studies that we deem to be notable. However, to gain a more complete understanding of the body of evidence, we encourage all stakeholders to thoroughly review the extensive detail of scientific studies that have been published over the years. This past May, Dr. Zheng from the second affiliated hospital of Jiaxing University in China, published a systematic review and meta-analysis comparing outcomes of robotic right colectomy procedures with outcomes associated with laparoscopic right colectomy.Published in techniques in coloproctology, this meta-analysis evaluated a total of 15,241 patients across 42 studies with over 2,700 subjects in the robotic right colectomy group and over 12,000 subjects in the laparoscopic group, and included outcomes associated with the entire population as well as outcomes for both intra-corporeal and extracorporeal anastomosis. Looking at the population overall, the authors reported among other outcomes, an approximately half day shorter length of hospital stay, 51% lower risk of conversion to laparotomy, and a 12% lower risk of complications with the robotic approach. Notably, in the subgroup specifically comparing outcomes for procedures with an intra-corporeal anastomosis, the robotic right colectomy group was associated with a shorter length of hospital stay by approximately 16 hours and a 65 % lower risk of conversion to laparotomy.Within the extracorporeal and anastomosis subgroup, the robotic-assisted approach was associated with a 40% lower risk of overall complications. The authors concluded in part that, quote, the safety and efficacy of robotic right colectomy is superior to laparoscopic right colectomy, especially when an intracorporeal anastomosis has performed, end quote. Turning to a clinical study reporting outcomes for robotic assisted and video assisted thoracoscopic surgery, Dr. Mirza Zain Baig from Danbury Hospital in Connecticut, published outcomes comparing lobectomies performed with either approach using the National Cancer Database. This study focused on patients with complex etiology such as non-small cell lung cancer who had received neoadjuvant therapy, had N1/N2 disease or had a tumor greater than five centimeters and compared 9,506 with over 2,100 in the robotic arm and over 7,000 in the VATS arm.Notably, when analyzing rates of conversions to open, the authors reported a 7.7% lower rate of conversion to open in the robotic arm with an approximately two times higher risk of conversion associated with the VATS group. The authors concluded, quote, in summary, our analysis of the National Cancer Database suggests that robotic lobectomy for complex lung resections achieve similar perioperative outcomes and R0 resections as VATS lobectomy with the reception of a lower rate of conversion to thoracotomy, end quote. I will now turn to our financial outlook for 2023. Starting with procedures. On our last call, we forecasted full year 2023 procedure growth within a range of 18% to 21%. We are now increasing our forecast and expect full year 2023 procedure growth of 20% to 22%.The low end of the range reflects uncertainty around the duration of elevated procedure volumes with patients returning to healthcare, continued slowing of bariatric growth rates in the US and macroeconomic challenges that could impact hospitals and patient spending. At the high end of the range, we assume macroeconomic challenges do not have a significant impact on hospital procedure volumes and bariatric growth rates in the US continue at the rate we saw in Q2. The range does not reflect significant material supply chain disruptions or hospital capacity constraints. Turning to gross profit. We continue to expect our 2023 full year pro forma gross profit margin to be within 68% and 69%. Our actual gross profit margin will vary quarter-to-quarter depending largely on product, regional and trading mix and the impact of new product introductions.With respect to operating expenses, on our last call, we forecast pro forma operating expense growth to be between 11% and 15%. We are adjusting our estimate and now expect our full year pro forma operating expense growth to be between 12% and 15%. We are also updating our estimate for non-cash stock compensation expense to range between $600 million to $620 million in 2023, narrowing the range from our previous estimate of $600 million to $630 million. We are increasing our estimate for other income which is comprised mostly of interest income to total between $160 million and $180 million in 2023, an increase from our previous estimate of $140 million and $160 million. The increase primarily reflects the rise in interest rates. With regard to capital expenditures, we continue to estimate a range of $800 million to $1 billion, primarily for planned facility construction activities.With regard to income tax, we continue to estimate our 2023 pro forma tax rate to be between 22% and 24% of pre-tax income. That concludes our prepared comments. We will now open the call to your questions.See also 30 Cities with the Highest Altitudes in the World and 20 Most Efficient Countries in the World.To continue reading the Q&amp;A session, please click here.]"

The fundamentals of our business were healthy in the second quarter with strong procedure and utilization growth and strong capital placements. Our product operations teams continue to build capacity and deliver in a dynamic supply chain environment as customers increasingly rely upon us for routine use. Our research and development efforts continued to build momentum in the quarter, including positive development milestones for our Intuitive ecosystem, including systems, instruments, accessories, digital tools and new indications. Turning first to procedures, growth in the quarter was 22%. Areas of strength included general surgery and gynecology for benign conditions, particularly in the United States. General surgery procedure growth was led by cholecystectomy and hernia repair. Colon and rectal procedure growth was healthy. Global procedure growth was also strong in the quarter, led by a recovery in China and continued strength in Japan, Germany and the U.K. Ion procedures showed continued strength with 145% growth in Q2 of '23. SP procedure growth was accretive with 40% global growth in the quarter, driven by accelerating growth in the United States. On the capital front, we placed 331 systems in Q2 compared with 279 systems in Q2 of last year. Our clinical installed base now stands at 7,900 multiport da Vinci systems, 435 Ion systems and 142 single-port da Vinci systems. Overall, our capital placement trends reflected demand for additional capacity in multiport, strong interest in our Ion system and stable demand for SP as we build our SP indications. System utilization defined as procedures per installed clinical system per quarter grew 9% globally year-over-year, reaching a new high as customers adopt a broad mix of procedures on our systems. We believe real-world evidence of improvements across the quadruple aim from better patient outcomes to surgeon satisfaction and lower total cost to treat per patient episode underpin this increasing utilization. Turning to our finances. Our revenue grew 15% in the quarter. Our capital and operating expenses were within our spend guidance, reflecting continued investments in R&amp;D to support growth of our platforms and digital tools, expansion of our manufacturing and commercial footprints and capital amortization. We will continue investing in R&amp;D, manufacturing and commercial operations to serve our global markets at industrial scale. These investments are likely to be lumpy over the next couple of years as significant operations expansions and other projects complete. Taking a step back, we have found that the quadruple aim is the right north star for us, focusing on demonstrable improvements to outcomes across specific procedures and patient populations, increasing patient and care team satisfaction and lowering the total cost to treat per patient episode. As electronic medical records have been adopted, we have partnered with our customers to analyze this data, building real-world evidence and big data approaches to measure quadruple aim improvements within countries, regions and health systems. Paired with our ecosystem investments in training services and products and powered by digital tools that can generate actionable intelligence from surgical data, we can help our customers analyze their programs, recommend and support actions to improve performance and lower total costs. This integrated business system is catalyzing our customers' goal of strong MIS programs by servicing actionable and measurable steps. Our approach is scalable for us too, working for our da Vinci platforms and for Ion and opening the door to future opportunities. Turning to our ecosystem investments. We're making solid progress extending our offerings to new clinical domains and new regions. For da Vinci multiport, we recently obtained NMPA registration for Xi local production in China. This means our da Vinci Xi will be able to compete for the locally sourced tender subset of the recently released updated national quota. Our da Vinci SP team achieved several milestones recently. We completed patient enrollment for our colorectal and Thoracic IDE trials, continued our first phase of launch of SP in Japan and submitted our CE mark dossier for SP in Europe. Turning to Ion. Our team installed their first Ion system in the U.K. and initiated first cases. For our digital tools, we have initiated our Phase I launch of CASE Insights, our name for our computational observer. CASE Insights is a tool that works with the da Vinci system and hospital data to build AI models that find correlations between surgical technique, patient populations and surgical outcomes. Our first phase of launch builds on work over the past few years with our clinical research partners to refine objective performance indicators and link them to actionable changes to improve outcomes, shortened training times and improve surgical program efficiency. We think these computational tools can make a significant impact using real-world and real-time data to improve skills and outcomes and to inform future product and automation opportunities. That said, features can be built quickly but long-term validation is arduous. We're a science-driven organization and will work through validation pathways in pursuit of long-term success. We do not expect material revenue from CASE insights for the next several quarters. In closing, our core business has momentum. We see a significant long-term opportunity to improve the quadruple aim using our integrated ecosystem powered by analytics and we are pacing our investments to catalyze that opportunity. I'll now turn the time over to Jamie, who will take you through our finances in greater detail.Jamie E. SamathGood afternoon. I will describe the highlights of our performance on a non-GAAP or pro forma basis. I will also summarize our GAAP performance later in my prepared remarks. A reconciliation between our pro forma and GAAP results is posted on our website. Global procedure growth in Q2 of 22% and reflected U.S. procedure growth of 19% and 28% procedure growth outside of the U.S. Procedures in Q2 benefited from higher patient admissions as hospitals, particularly in the U.S. catch up with patients whose diagnosis and/or treatment was delayed during the pandemic. Consistent with our comments last quarter, our contributions to procedure growth from surgeons new to the da Vinci platform was strong, reflecting both the strength of our training capabilities and an increasing number of graduates of residency and fellowship programs who are trained on da Vinci. Within one of our target procedure areas, bariatric surgery, our growth rate in the U.S. slowed during the quarter. Some customers have indicated that they are seeing increased patient interest in weight loss drugs. It is too early to conclude if the slowing growth is a temporary pause as patients evaluate these new drug therapies or if it's a trend that continues. We believe that during the quarter, da Vinci continued to gain market share in the bariatric surgical market. Our U.S. procedure growth of 28% reflected strength in China, the U.K., Germany and Japan. Strong procedure growth in China was driven by a continued recovery from more recent COVID-related impacts and a favorable comparison to Q2 last year, which was also impacted by the pandemic. Consistent with our comments last quarter, growth in non-neurology procedures outside of the United States was accretive, growing at approximately 35% driven by increases in colorectal, hysterectomy and thoracic procedures. Turning to other key metrics. In Q2, the installed base of da Vinci Systems grew 13% to just over 8,000 systems driven primarily by demand for additional capacity given procedure growth. Average system utilization grew almost 9% year-over-year reflecting an increasing mix of short duration benign procedures in the U.S. and customers prioritizing use of their existing assets given the financial pressures they face. With respect to capital performance, we placed 331 systems in the second quarter ahead of our expectations. Capital strength in the quarter included a higher number of placements to our distributors and a higher number of multi-system deals in the U.S. relative to recent trends, reflecting in part, certain placements accelerated into Q2 from future quarters. Despite Q2 system placements being ahead of our expectations, customers, particularly in the U.S. appear to be cautious in their capital spending given ongoing financial pressures. We placed 279 systems in Q2 of last year, which, as a reminder, reflected a delay in the shipment of approximately 15 systems from June into July as a result of supply chain challenges we encountered during the quarter. Q2 revenue was $1.8 billion, an increase of 15% year-over-year. On a constant currency basis, second quarter revenue grew approximately 17%. Recurring revenue represented 85% of total revenue as compared to 72% for the full year 2019 and grew 20% over last year, driven by procedure growth and an increase in the installed base of systems under operating lease arrangements. Additional revenue statistics and trends are as follows: in the U.S., we placed 157 systems in the second quarter compared to 150 systems placed last year. Outside the U.S., we placed 174 systems in Q2 compared with 129 systems last year. Current quarter system placements included 76 into Europe, 33 into Japan and 16 into China compared with 78 into Europe, 18 into Japan and 15 into China in Q2 of last year. During the quarter, the China National Health Commission published the 14th 5-year quota of 559 robotic systems. For those systems awarded to our JV under the new quota, we expect a significant majority to be placed in 2024 through 2027. We are seeing increasing participation of local competitors in tender processes under the national quota. In addition, during 2023, we have experienced pricing pressure in China as a result of provincial government policy changes and competition. These dynamics create greater variability in the outlook for our procedure, system placement and revenue performance in China. In Q2, 60 of the 331 systems placed were trading transactions compared to 56 trading transactions in the second quarter of last year. As of the end of Q2, there are approximately 500 SIs remaining in the installed base, of which 97 are in the U.S. Leasing represented 50% of Q2 placements compared with 42% for both last quarter and last year. In the U.S., 78% of system placements in Q2 were under operating lease arrangements compared to 59% last quarter. The higher rate of operating leases in the U.S. is primarily driven by an increasing customer preference for our usage-based leasing models in part due to capital budget constraints and continuing financial pressures faced by many of our customers. In addition, some customers are choosing leasing structures to preserve flexibility to upgrade to next-generation technology. As a result of these dynamics and the earlier stage of our leasing program with OUS customers, we continue to expect that the proportion of placements under operating leases will increase over time. Q2 system average selling prices were $1.39 million as compared to $1.47 million last quarter. The sequential decrease in system SPs was primarily driven by a higher mix of X placements for purchase deals and geographical mix. We recognized $12 million of lease buyout revenue in the second quarter compared with $24 million last quarter and $23 million in Q2 of 2022. Da Vinci instrument and accessory revenue per procedure was approximately $1,840 compared with approximately $1,780 last quarter and $1,900 last year. On a sequential basis, higher [INA] per procedure was driven primarily by the INA price increase we described last quarter and customer ordering patterns. Turning to our Ion platform. In Q2, we placed 59 Ion systems as compared to 41 in Q2 of 2022. Second quarter Ion procedures of approximately 12,700 increased 145% as compared to last year. During the quarter, we placed our first Ion system in the U.K. market and in this early phase of our European launch, we are focused on the collection of clinical data in support of our reimbursement strategy. 12 of the systems placed in the second quarter were SP systems, compared to 10 systems last quarter. SP procedures grew by 40% and average system utilization growth accelerated from last quarter's 12%, increasing by 14% compared to Q2 of last year. Moving on to the rest of the P&amp;L. Pro forma gross margin for the second quarter was 68.5% compared with 67.2% last quarter and 69.2% last year. Pro forma gross margin was lower than last year, primarily due to a higher mix of Ion revenue which currently carries significantly lower margins as compared to the da Vinci business and lower system SP. As we described last quarter, improving product costs and manufacturing efficiency is a priority for our teams over the medium term. Second quarter pro forma operating expenses increased 12% year-over-year, driven primarily by increased headcount added throughout last year, higher variable compensation, increased prototype expenses and increased expenses associated with customer training in support of procedure growth. Pro forma operating expenses represented 33% of revenue in Q2 compared to 35% of revenue for the full year 2022, reflecting in part planned leverage in our enabling functions. Capital expenditures in Q2 were $178 million, primarily comprised of infrastructure investments to expand our facilities footprint and increase manufacturing capacity. Our pro forma effective tax rate for the second quarter was 22.3%, consistent with our expectations. Second quarter pro forma net income was $507 million or $1.42 per share compared with $415 million or $1.14 per share for Q2 of last year. I will now summarize our GAAP results. GAAP net income was $421 million or $1.18 per share for the second quarter of 2023 compared with GAAP net income of $308 million or $0.85 per share for the second quarter of 2022. The adjustments between pro forma and GAAP net income are outlined and quantified on our website and include excess tax benefits associated with employee stock awards, employee stock-based compensation, amortization of intangibles and gains and losses on strategic investments. We ended the quarter with cash and investments of $7.1 billion compared with $6.6 billion last quarter. The sequential increase in cash and investments reflected cash from operating activities, proceeds from employee stock exercises partially offset by capital expenditures. And with that, I would like to turn it over to Brian, who will discuss clinical highlights and provide our updated outlook for 2023.Brian KingThank you, Jamie. Our overall second quarter procedure growth was 22% year-over-year compared to 14% for the second quarter of 2022 and 26% last quarter.

Published in techniques in Coloproctology, this meta analysis evaluated a total of 15,241 patients across 42 studies with over 2,700 subjects in the robotic right colectomy group and over 12,000 subjects in the laparoscopic group and included outcomes associated with the entire population as well as outcomes for both intracorporeal and extracorporeal anastomosis. Looking at the population overall, the authors reported among other outcomes, an approximately half day shorter length of hospital stay, 51% lower risk of conversion to laparotomy and a 12% lower risk of complications with a robotic approach. Notably, in the subgroup specifically comparing outcomes for procedures within Intracorporeal anastomosis. The robotic right colectomy group was associated with a shorter length of hospital stay by approximately 16 hours and a 65% lower risk of conversion to laparotomy. Within the extracorporeal anastomosis subgroup, the robotic-assisted approach was associated with a 40% lower risk of overall complications. The authors concluded in part that, ""The safety and efficacy of robotic right colectomy is superior to laparoscopic right colectomy, especially when an Intracorporeal anastomosis has performed"".

This study focused on patients with complex etiology, such as non-small cell lung cancer who have received neoadjuvant therapy at [N1.2] disease or had a tumor greater than 5 centimeters and compared 9,500 subjects with over 2,100 in the robotic arm and over 7,000 in the [bats] arm. Notably, when analyzing rates of conversions to open, the authors reported a 7.7% lower rate of conversion to open in the robotic arm with an approximately 2x higher risk of conversion associated with the bats group. The authors concluded, ""In summary, our analysis of the National Cancer Database suggests that robotic lobectomy for complex lung resections achieved similar perioperative outcomes and [R0] resections (inaudible) lobectomy with the exception of a lower rate of conversion to thoracotomy"". I will now turn to our financial outlook for 2023. Starting with procedures. On our last call, we forecasted full year 2023 procedure growth within a range of 18% to 21%. We are now increasing our forecast and expect full year 2023 procedure growth of 20% to 22%. The low end of the range reflects uncertainty around the duration of elevated procedure volumes with patients returning to healthcare, continued slowing of bariatric growth rates in the U.S. and macroeconomic challenges that could impact hospitals and patient spending. At the high end of the range, we assume macroeconomic challenges do not have a significant impact on hospital procedure volumes, and bariatric growth rates in the U.S. continue at the rate we saw in Q2. The range does not reflect significant material supply chain disruptions or hospital capacity constraints. Turning to gross profit. We continue to expect our 2023 full year pro forma gross profit margin to be within 68% and 69%. Our actual gross profit margin will vary quarter-to-quarter depending largely on product, regional and trade-in mix and the impact of new product introductions. With respect to operating expenses. On our last call, we forecast pro forma operating expense growth to be between 11% and 15%. We are adjusting our estimate and now expect our full year pro forma operating expense growth to be between 12% and 15%. We are also updating our estimate for noncash stock compensation expense to range $600 million to $620 million in 2023, narrowing the range from our previous estimate of $600 million to $630 million. We are increasing our estimate for other income which is comprised mostly of interest income, to total between $160 million and $180 million in 2023, an increase from our previous estimate of $140 million and $160 million. The increase primarily reflects the rise in interest rates. With regard to capital expenditures, we continue to estimate a range of $800 million to $1 billion, primarily for planned facility construction activities. With regard to income tax, we continue to estimate our 2023 pro forma tax rate to be between 22% and 24% of pretax income. That concludes our prepared comments. We will now open the call to your questions.Question and Answer SessionOperator(Operator Instructions) We go through the first question from the line of Larry Biegelsen, Wells Fargo.Lawrence H. BiegelsenGary, just two for me. One big picture question on AI and second, on procedure growth. So AI is obviously having its moment in the sun here, Gary. I'm curious, where is Intuitive spending time in applying AI? Is it imaging, movement of the robot, training? I'd love to hear your thoughts, and then I have one follow-up.Gary S. GuthartYes. Well, I'll start on AI. Let's talk about what it is. For us, it's a suite of digital tools that rests on a baseline and then can be built upon using various machine learning techniques including computer vision. We've been at it for some time. We started the Internet-of-Things for surgical robots over a decade ago. We built the baseline of cyber secure privacy-compliant pipes that allow us to get access to the data. So there's some foundational work that was important. That's kind of step 1. Step 2 is to collaborate with customers and aggregate data that is meaningful. AI is only as good as the quality of the data that you feed it. And so for us, that has been robot data, some other data in electronic medical record data in partnership with our customer base. We've been doing that for several years now. From that, I think you can start to do analytic inspections. You can do analysis on the data, look for correlations. Sometimes it's pretty simple math. That gets you big data explorations, some simple things that we can do to help our customers become more efficient and to expose variation. Over time, you can invest further in things like computer vision, which we have been doing and into predictive analytics, the idea that you can look at surgical data science, understand the variation of patient populations and what's happening in surgery and start to create tools, digital tools that can help improve outcomes or speed learning curves or lower operating costs and we're going to work on all of those things. So of the things you mentioned, we have our toe in the water in many, and we've had for some time. As I said in the script, the feature content can be moved pretty quickly. I think the validations take real time to do well, particularly outcome-based or interventional validations. And so we're going to go through and do that with real rigor. So I expect us to continue down that pathway.Lawrence H. BiegelsenThat's very helpful. And then on procedures, I'm just wondering, you talked about some catch-up in Q2. How are you thinking about how much of the backlog of deferred procedures is still left? You talked about the diagnostic procedures on the last call. And any color on what you're assuming for bariatrics here for the rest of the year? And does that mean international will continue to be stronger than the U.S.?Gary S. GuthartLet me talk a little bit about, I think, the patient population that moved to the sidelines during the pandemic, and then I'll turn the assessment over to Jamie. On the kind of the pandemic response, it's hard to exactly estimate how many folks would have been in diagnostic pipelines that did not get their tests. We do look at the data that's available to do that. I don't think it will clear in just one quarter. I think our past experience on these things is that lower utilization happened over a several year period, and it will probably take many quarters for it to fully recover. How long that is, I think it's very, very hard to estimate. So far, so good. You asked a question about bariatrics, I'm going to turn that over to Jamie. He spoke about it a little bit in his prepared remarks.Jamie E. SamathYes. What we saw in Q2 was that growth rate slowed. We have some input from customers that the level of patient interest is such that patients are now considering drugs versus surgery. It's unclear yet based on that set of inputs from customers the duration of that evaluation by parents and patients and obviously, it's layered. So what we did for our guidance was we just said at the high end for the remainder of the year, the bariatrics growth rate in the U.S. is consistent with what we saw in Q2. And at the low end, we said that the growth rate continues to slow a little bit over the course of the year as patients become increasingly educated about the weight loss drugs. And obviously, there's a number of factors that patients have to consider with respect to those drugs, cost, side effects, what happens if they come off the drugs and regain weight, et cetera. But I think from our perspective, we're early in understanding what the longer-term impact will be. Customers have said that they have confidence that there is a role for surgery in weight loss and that will endure over kind of the longer term. What happens in for the rest of the year, I think we'll see.OperatorWe'll go to the next question. Go to the line of Travis Steed, Bank of America.Travis Lee SteedI did want to ask about China and the China quota and how you think the opportunity is now that there's more local players, but you also have the local version of Xi and on the bariatrics, just a quick follow-up on that, too. Is that around 100,000 procedures. Just trying to think about sizing that their active surgery opportunity or impact?Jamie E. SamathWe've set the market size in the U.S. is about 200,000 procedures annually for what we think is a good mesh for robotics. And in terms of where we are in penetration, we're kind of at the -- if I put it in quartiles, we're at the beginning of the second quartile. What was your first question, Travis?Travis Lee SteedIt was on China and the China quota and how to think about that opportunity there versus last quarter, given there's more local players, but now you have the local version of Xi.Jamie E. SamathYes. I mean, obviously, there's increased opportunity in the sense that this quota is 559 systems relative to the prior quota of 225 systems, but you also have now 5 local players. There will be government interest in success of local players. We do believe the surgeons care about capability and feature set and so the extent to which da Vinci continues to be differentiated, I think, is to our advantage. In the -- and we are seeing those local players increasingly participate in tenders with respect to how that quota will be allocated. So it gets allocated from the central government to the provinces and then it goes through tender processes. So there is some time before that results in placements and that's why we said in our prepared remarks, we think the bulk of the subset of that quota, our JV wins will be in '24 through '27. I also described some dynamics that create greater variability with respect to pricing pressure and increasing competition. So I think for us, that's something that we're going to watch carefully over the next year or so.Travis Lee SteedGreat. And a question for Gary. Just I heard the comment on hospitals leasing more to preserve the upgrade option for the next-gen system. So maybe just talk high level, the pipeline comments on the FDA and kind of supply chain bottlenecks that you saw last year? And then and how you're thinking about incremental upgrade to the Gen 4 versus kind of new platforms?Gary S. GuthartSure. On the supply chain health side, we are seeing fewer pockets of challenge, but some pockets nonetheless. So there's been significant focus and attention to make sure that we're supplying our customers what they need as we go through a pretty nice procedure growth curve. So they're calling out improvement in the breadth of supply chain challenge, but cautioning that there are still some pockets that need attention or require attention. We continue to work on multiple things. As you know, we're working on next generations of our platforms, in general, that is a routine activity for us. How we make the decision between upgrading a current generation versus moving it to the next generation really is around customer value of that switch and the convenience and economics of doing an upgrade versus a platform changeover. And we expect to do some of both. We are usually working on the next two generations because of the time it takes to develop a platform, not just the next one, but the next one after that. And current time is really no different. We're pleased with the performance of our engineering teams and prosecuting those upgrades and technologies. What I will say is prioritization wise, what we care about is can we improve patient outcomes in a real way or open a new population of patients to the benefits of (inaudible) surgery. So we look at that. We look to improve the surgeon and care team experience, whether that's in their ergonomics or their workflow and the like with which they perceive our systems. We work to improve efficiencies of overall programs. We'll work on things that make hospital programs more efficient and we work to lower the total cost to treat per patient episode. And when we find feature sets and technologies that do that, then we get pretty excited about them and drive them hard.OperatorOur next question is from the line of Robbie Marcus, JPMorgan.Robert Justin MarcusCongrats on a really nice quarter. I heard the comment on prototype expenses are increasing. So I figure I'll try my luck here, and I know you're not going to tell us when a next-gen or if the next-gen system is coming. But I want to ask around just implications if and when one does, you have a lot of leases now. Do they have the option to upgrade? And will that come through at higher revenues? And how do we think about the prototyping expense and really what that's for?Jamie E. SamathYes, I'm not going to be specific on the prototype expense and it's distributed across a number of programs. Prototype expenses tend to be lumpy within Q2 relative to the comparison point. It just so happened to be a quarter where that was one of the direct drivers of our expenditure. Nothing more than that, I would say. As we've grown the proportion of the installed basis under leases, I think it's about 2,000 systems now that are under lease in the installed base. Generally, they have a technology obsolescence clause. That's kind of in part a reflection of customer feedback from when we launched Xi. So that's routinely in our operating lease arrangements and that cause generally gives customers the opportunity to change that existing lease to the lease of any new next-generation technology. And that is not a specified price, by the way, that's to be negotiated. So I wouldn't say anything more about price.Robert Justin MarcusGreat. And maybe, Jamie, one more for you on the financial side. Another nice quarter of cash flow generation, north of $7 billion on the balance sheet. Interest rates, high inflation, high as well. How are you thinking about maximizing the cash here? And how should we think about the priorities?Jamie E. SamathWith respect to capital allocation, I think our priorities are consistent for how they've been for some time now. Our first priority is to invest in the business, both in capital expenditures, which as you've seen by our guidance are relatively high to our history this year and in organically investing in operating expenses. Second is to acquire technology externally that gives us a differentiated capability or accelerate us in the marketplace. That's generally license arrangements, IP acquisition or tuck-in acquisitions. And we continue to look at returning cash to shareholders opportunistically. And I think that's served us well. If you look at kind of the last 18 months, we repurchased 12.6 million shares for $3 billion at an average price of $234 and we did that opportunistically in large part because it reflects kind of the stage of the company. We're relatively early in the robotics space where we look for growth, and I think that's served us well.OperatorOur next question is from the line of Rick Wise, Stifel.Frederick Allen WiseGary, I recently visited several European hospitals and robotic programs. And frankly, and honestly came way more impressed than ever with Intuitive's European commercial presence reputation. But I was particularly intrigued to hear one particularly high-volume robotic surgeon talk about what's next. And it seemed less focused on systems and very much focused on enabling technologies that make everything better, faster, clearer, et cetera. And they included things like integrated CT image overlays during procedures. That aspect of augmented reality tools that bring CT and surgery together, next generation firefly. He was dreaming of virtual [rulers], dual [SureForm] 45 and 60 staplers and haptic feedback. I mean that was -- it was fascinating to hear. Are these the kinds of innovations that are priorities for you? And are these the kind of things you want to make docs like that excited about? Is that what you're -- the kind of stuff you're working on?Gary S. GuthartYou had a long list. I think several of those are important and things that we have talked about and have shared with the world. I think the idea of higher confidence ability to identify tissue in real time for the surgeon, and we can do that in a few different ways. So the florescence imaging, that you described and other advanced imaging technologies that give surgeons the ability to see beyond the surface of the tissue and beyond what you can see with normal white-light imaging, we absolutely think that's helping clinical outcomes and we're excited about and investing in image fusion or data fusion, and that's the CT overlay, the segmentation of preoperative MR and CT scans and the ability to use that in real time during the case, we think, can change outcomes and change efficiency in the OR. Other types of analytic and sensing capabilities, we think are really powerful and important. And to the earlier question about AI, machine learning, machine vision, these things work together. So high-definition images that show you things beyond the surface of the tissue plus computer vision, plus AI models can give you some predictive analytics that I think are really powerful and would help surgeons get to better outcomes, reduce complications. So I am like that surgeon, quite excited.Frederick Allen WiseGreat. Just a follow-up, quick follow-up. You -- I think, if I remember correctly, took a 5% across-the-board price hike on instrumentation. I don't know if I'm remembering correctly, that was to kick in like June 1. Did that happen? Did it help the quarter? And should I assume that it's going to be a little bit of an offset or a little bit of an instrument tailwind in the second half and beyond?Jamie E. SamathIt was largely implemented in Q2, Rick. It wasn't effective at the beginning of the quarter, I'd say, roughly half of the quarter benefited from the price increase. Our estimate for the impact of the price increase is consistent with what we said last quarter, roughly about $100 million impact to revenue and profit for the year. Again, you get kind of half an impact in Q2 and the full impact in Q3 and Q4.Gary S. GuthartA reminder, our motivations on that, we've been quite conservative on pricing. Our input pricing in the last few years has gone up in terms of raw material and labor content. We have offset most of that through efficiency and scale advantages, but we felt like it was time to share some of that with our customers, and that was what was behind the price increase.OperatorWe go to the next line. I have Richard of Truist Security.Richard Samuel NewitterRichard Newitter here. Jamie, maybe for you on the guidance, 20% to 22%, very healthy. I'm just curious on thinking about the low end of the range there. You specifically mentioned you contemplate bariatric surgery growth trends, eroding a little bit from the 2Q levels. What's the pace of erosion there that you're thinking about that would get you to the low end? Like how much erosion, how did you establish a baseline for yourself?Jamie E. SamathYes, I don't want to get too specific there, Rick, given just the relative size of bariatrics in the U.S. to our overall procedures. We can obviously see the progression between Q1 and Q2, I'd call it a moderate, steady progression in the model in Q3 and Q4. The overall impact on that is obviously a function of the size of the bariatrics business for us. It's not some dramatic falloff.Richard Samuel NewitterOkay. That's helpful. And just maybe sticking on the same topic here on bariatrics. Just thinking about the areas that you could offset that as we think of procedure categories geographically or by category that could be nearing an inflection point like Bariatric got to several years ago, what procedure categories or geographies would you call out that you think could lead to overage there to offset any potential incremental slowdown in bariatrics, if any?Jamie E. SamathI'm not going to answer that in terms of overage, but I'll say where we're seeing healthy growth. If you take our largest 7 markets, which is a focus for us, so China, Japan, South Korea, Germany, France, U.K. and Italy, what you're seeing in those markets is generally a progression beyond urology into the next set of cancer procedures. It's market by market. But generally, that's hysterectomy, thoracic and colorectal procedures. And we're seeing them on the early stages of an adoption curve, and that's why we've talked about our OUS business now is about half outside of urology or beyond urology. This quarter, it grew 35% that subset. That's consistent with what we saw in Q1. That subset also grew 35%. So I think we're excited in those larger markets where we have that focus and continue to drive the adoption curve in that next set of procedures. If you look at market by market, you have some unique dynamics in China. You see liver and pancreas procedure doing well in Japan, treatment of stomach cancer in Korea, for example, you see thyroid. But it's really that next step procedures.Gary S. GuthartJust I want to just step back a little bit on bariatrics, we've had a few questions on it and just make a point. As we go out and talk to surgeons, we talk to obesity physicians and pharmacologists, which we do in terms of our diligence. The sense here is that the market is going to adjust to the change in treatment pathway as it relates to drugs. However, it doesn't look like the drugs are a cure and may not be a fast path to cure and a strong consensus among those we speak to, including people who are not surgeons, physicians who are not surgeons is that the surgery and other interventions are going to remain an important part of the interaction. As the -- in the near term, I think the market will adjust to understand what role the drugs will play but they're not cures and the discontinued rate remains pretty high, and the populations of patients who don't get any benefit from the drugs also remain significant. So I think there's an adjustment period here and we should be aware of it. But that may become a tailwind in future quarters as folks work through those sets of pathways and look at long-term and durable solutions into the obesity challenges.OperatorWe'll go to the next line of Ryan Zimmerman, BTIG.Ryan Benjamin ZimmermanMaybe one for Jamie. On the expense management standpoint, I mean, procedures are going up a little bit faster than expense -- OpEx guidance by about 50 basis points or so in and so I'm just wondering, Jamie, kind of what your views are on expense management and letting some of that leverage flow through as we think about not just the back half of the year, but into '24 versus maybe reinvesting that in R&amp;D?Jamie E. SamathYes. For this year, we have specific objectives with respect to leverage in our enabling functions, which we've described previously. And that's a set of objectives that I think we intend to fulfill. Largely, what you see in the adjustments we've made to our operating expense guidance for this year is a function of our top line performance, both in variable compensation and in the number of reps we need in the field to support a higher procedure base. For the rest of kind of operating expense set of investments, we're holding to -- we're largely holding to our plan for this year. When you project into '24, I'm not going to kind of describe the direction of where spend will go relative to procedural revenue, we'll do that in January. But you have a couple of dynamics. We have a significant CapEx investments this year, $800 million to $1 billion, that will start to create incremental depreciation expense next year. A chunk of that will be in COGS and a chunk of that will be in operating expenses. So you have kind of an operating expense headwind coming there. And those investments being largely facilities, they are planned for the medium term, meaning they're inefficient for a period until you get to full occupancy or full utilization. On the other side, we'll continue to look to leverage our enabling functions into '24, where that shakes out, we'll do in January because we have to complete our planning process in the back half of this year.Ryan Benjamin ZimmermanOkay. That's very helpful. And then I noticed, and this is kind of directed at Gary, you commented on this a little earlier, but you disclosed for the first time, I believe the proportion of lease agreements that are usage-based versus fixed operating lease agreement. And I'm wondering, Gary, what that says and the trends that we see there about the health of our customers and what their preference is over time?Gary S. GuthartYes, it's a good question. I think we see that one size doesn't fit all. There are some folks for whom they still remain happy about capital purchases. They see it as the cheapest way for them to access systems. They have high confidence and they're going to buy. There are some folks for whom capital is tight, scarce and or they're interested in future technology protection clauses, and they would rather lease. And there are some folks who are looking at expansions, are a little bit unsure about how fast volume might ramp and for them, usage-based arrangements give them some protections about ramp timing and speed. Our analytical capabilities are pretty good, and our finance flexibility is pretty good. And as a result, we'll have that conversation pretty direct way, and I think the market starts to settle where it settles. If you ask, do we have a strong preference for one of those models, the answer is not really.Jamie E. SamathThe motivation by the way, for the new disclosure was simply the rate at which those adoption of those models have grown, we felt, okay it was important to be transparent as to what portion of operating leases and placements that structure was. If you kind of assess all of our usage-based arrangements in aggregate life today relative to usage patterns and economic objectives in total, on average, they're slightly above our expectations. So they performed well so far. That's obviously a blend across different customers and systems. Some are overperforming, some are underperforming. But I think part of the way that we've operated the program is to look carefully. Is it actually reducing barriers for accelerated growth of our customers? And is it producing the economic results for us and our customers and as we and customers have gained confidence, that's part of the reason why it's expanded the way it has.OperatorAnd we'll go to the next line. Go to the line of Andrew Ranieri, Morgan Stanley.Andrew Christopher RanieriMaybe just one other follow-up question on bariatrics, but maybe a different angle. I mean, we've talked to some general surgeons too, that mean they're kind of suggesting that these new drugs might even open up potential procedure categories where these patients might not have been suited to have surgery. Gary, kind of like what are your views on this? Do you see some near-term disruption from GLP-1s on the bariatric side but maybe this opening doors for other procedure categories?Gary S. GuthartYes. That's a little bit of the narrative we're hearing too. We go out and canvas our customers pretty widely. There may be a role for kind of new adjuvant use of drugs and then as you say, that may condition some patient populations to be beneficiaries of surgery downstream. There may be folks who start the drugs, get the benefits that they were hoping for, but either the side effects or the cost or the change lifestyle that the drugs are implying, make it hard to sustain. There's a fair amount of that in the literature. So that may -- that population may look for other solutions. I think we're just going to have to work through it and see. What we don't see yet is a magic pill, one that cures it and doesn't require behavior change or other lifestyle modification and that -- and it seems unlikely. And as a result, I think we're going to see an adjustment, how long that adjustment period lasts, none of us know. But we know that there will be a role for surgical and mechanical intervention after the fact. And I think we're well positioned. And as Jamie had mentioned, it looks like even in the current environment, the share continues to move our way. So we're going to stay close to it.Andrew Christopher RanieriIs there any procedure categories that are coming up in your conversations that stand the most benefit?Gary S. GuthartIt's a good question. We're probing probably too soon for us to give you a definitive answer. Right. That was our last question, and thank you. In closing, we continue to believe there is a substantial and durable opportunity to fundamentally improve surgery and acute interventions. Our teams continue to work closely with hospitals, physicians and care teams in pursuit of what our customers have termed the quadruple aim. Better, more predictable patient outcomes, better experiences for patients, better experiences for their care teams and, ultimately, a lower total cost to treat. We believe value creation in surgery and acute care is foundationally human. It flows from respect for and understanding of patients and care teams, their needs and their environment. At Intuitive, we envision a future of care that's less invasive and profoundly better where diseases are identified earlier and treated quickly so patients can get back to what matters most. Thank you for your support on this extraordinary journey. We look forward to talking with you again in 3 months.OperatorThank you. Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude your conference. We do thank you for joining. You may now disconnect. Have a good day.]"

However, the bottom line declined year over year.Total revenues of $3,699 million lagged the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $3,730.6 million. The top line decreased 3% year over year due to lower fuel prices, reduced supplemental revenues, a decline in export coal benchmark prices and a decrease in intermodal volumes. These factors offset the effects of volume growth in coal and merchandise and solid gains in merchandise pricing.Second-quarter operating income fell 13% to $1,482 million.

(Photo: Jim Allen/FreightWaves)CSX is playing a long-term game when looking at encouraging shippers to switch from using trucks to using the railroads, and quantifying what that might look like could take some time, executives said during the eastern U.S. Class I railroad’s earnings call to discuss second-quarter 2023 results.“I think in terms of numbers we’ll probably put a finer point on the truck conversion opportunity over the next three years at some time in the future. There’s a huge focus by the team to really look at our pipeline and measure it and focus on those customers where there’s an opportunity. And some customers have a lot more opportunities than others and we are making sure we have the resources up against those customers to really drive that conversion,” Kevin Boone, CSX executive vice president for sales and marketing, told investors during the call late Thursday.To measure what conversion opportunities are available, CSX has internal tools it uses to analyze the data it receives. The railroad has also been holding multiple whiteboarding or brainstorming sessions since the start of this year, Boone said.But in order to bring about more market conversions from trucks to rail, the linchpin is proving that the railroad can provide reliability sustainably, Boone said.“I think the most important thing for a customer is reliability, right? And in some customers’ eyes, they want to see more of that reliability. They like what they see today. We’ve got to continue to perform and have those conversations. And sometimes it’s lane by lane. It’s carload by carload where we get that confidence from a customer,” Boone said.“And so we’re in the very early innings of this. We feel the acceleration from first quarter to second quarter, and I expect those conversations to pick up even more in the third and fourth quarters as we continue to perform,” he continued. “Sharing what we’re doing on the hiring side is incredibly helpful. Sharing with them what we plan to do to make our network more resilient, winning their confidence — that’s the No. 1 issue. It’s not price.”Story continuesCSX plans to keep ensuring reliability as a priority even if the market softens and there is pressure for the railroad to match resources with demand. CSX experienced volume and pricing growth in its merchandise segment in the second quarter, and there needs to be resources available to sustain trip plan compliance levels.“We’re watching the volumes very carefully and making sure that we have the staffing levels to support sustained high levels of customer service,” CSX President and CEO Joe Hinrichs said on the call. He noted that the market is “mixed,” with growth in metals, minerals and automotive volumes but declines in intermodal and chemicals volumes.“Our focus is really on making sure we have the manpower to be able to sustain” a certain level of service,” Hinrichs continued. “At the same time, of course, if we see volume reductions further than what we’re seeing right now, it will respond accordingly. But right now, the volumes that we’re seeing are supporting this merchandise volume growth and our high levels of service.”CSX CFO Sean Pelkey said the company has “levers we can pull” should the railroad need to respond to slumping macroeconomic conditions. “We would look to do that but not jeopardize the ability to continue to gain momentum and gain share off of the truck, which is the ultimate goal here to kind of grow the pie and grow our profitability,” Pelkey said.CSX Q2 2023 financial resultsCSX’s second-quarter 2023 financial results “met our expectations” of having to manage through lower intermodal storage revenue and normalizing export coal prices, Hinrichs said on the earnings call.But despite the lower intermodal volumes — due in part to slower imports and destocking — CSX’s merchandise segment saw stronger volumes and pricing in the second quarter, executives said.“Our network continues to run well, and our company’s initiatives combined with our employees’ hard work and commitment to making a big difference and helping to set our railroad apart,” Hinrichs said in prepared remarks. “There was much more to do, but our results this quarter show signs of the progress we are making as we lay the groundwork for long-term growth and value creation.”Revenue at the eastern U.S. Class I railroad fell 3% to $3.7 billion from the second quarter of 2022 amid lower fuel prices, reduced supplemental revenue, a decline in export coal benchmark prices and a decrease in intermodal volumes, the company said.Net income for CSX (NASDAQ: CSX) in the second quarter of 2023 was $996 million, or 49 cents per diluted share, down 15% from $1.18 billion, or 54 cents per diluted share, in the second quarter of 2022. Second-quarter 2022 results were also affected by a $122 million gain related to a property sale agreement with the commonwealth of Virginia.Operating income fell 13% to $1.48 billion, while operating ratio was 59.9%, compared with 55.4% in the second quarter of 2022. OR is a metric that investors sometimes use to gauge the financial health of a company, with a lower OR implying improved health.Expenses increased 5% year over year to $2.2 billion amid higher labor and fringe costs as well as higher depreciation and amortization expenses.Subscribe to FreightWaves’ e-newsletters and get the latest insights on freight right in your inbox.Click here for more FreightWaves articles by Joanna Marsh.Related links:CSX’s Q2 profit slips 15% on lower revenuesSites across US primed for rail-served industrial developmentRailroads move to create more access between Mexico, Texas, US SoutheastCPKC, CSX form joint venture for hydrogen locomotivesFreight rail leaders realize relationship rebuilding requiredThe post CSX continues to target truck-to-rail conversions appeared first on FreightWaves.]"
206,055e19bf-bca8-319c-985c-42a1c436bf83,CSX,2023-07-22,CSX's (NASDAQ:CSX) investors will be pleased with their favorable 52% return over the last five years,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/csxs-nasdaq-csx-investors-pleased-130019756.html,1689944419,STORY,['CSX'],"[When you buy and hold a stock for the long term, you definitely want it to provide a positive return. Better yet, you'd like to see the share price move up more than the market average. But CSX Corporation (NASDAQ:CSX) has fallen short of that second goal, with a share price rise of 43% over five years, which is below the market return. Zooming in, the stock is up a respectable 8.8% in the last year.With that in mind, it's worth seeing if the company's underlying fundamentals have been the driver of long term performance, or if there are some discrepancies. Check out our latest analysis for CSX To quote Buffett, 'Ships will sail around the world but the Flat Earth Society will flourish. There will continue to be wide discrepancies between price and value in the marketplace...' One imperfect but simple way to consider how the market perception of a company has shifted is to compare the change in the earnings per share (EPS) with the share price movement.During five years of share price growth, CSX actually saw its EPS drop 0.3% per year.So it's hard to argue that the earnings per share are the best metric to judge the company, as it may not be optimized for profits at this point. Since the change in EPS doesn't seem to correlate with the change in share price, it's worth taking a look at other metrics.The modest 1.3% dividend yield is unlikely to be propping up the share price. On the other hand, CSX's revenue is growing nicely, at a compound rate of 4.2% over the last five years. In that case, the company may be sacrificing current earnings per share to drive growth.You can see how earnings and revenue have changed over time in the image below (click on the chart to see the exact values).earnings-and-revenue-growthCSX is well known by investors, and plenty of clever analysts have tried to predict the future profit levels. So we recommend checking out this free report showing consensus forecastsWhat About Dividends?When looking at investment returns, it is important to consider the difference between total shareholder return (TSR) and share price return. Whereas the share price return only reflects the change in the share price, the TSR includes the value of dividends (assuming they were reinvested) and the benefit of any discounted capital raising or spin-off. It's fair to say that the TSR gives a more complete picture for stocks that pay a dividend. In the case of CSX, it has a TSR of 52% for the last 5 years. That exceeds its share price return that we previously mentioned. And there's no prize for guessing that the dividend payments largely explain the divergence!Story continuesA Different PerspectiveCSX provided a TSR of 10% over the last twelve months. Unfortunately this falls short of the market return. On the bright side, that's still a gain, and it's actually better than the average return of 9% over half a decade This suggests the company might be improving over time. While it is well worth considering the different impacts that market conditions can have on the share price, there are other factors that are even more important. Consider for instance, the ever-present spectre of investment risk.

But the reality is that when a company loses money each year, for long enough, its investors will usually take their share of those losses. Loss making companies can act like a sponge for capital - so investors should be cautious that they're not throwing good money after bad.So if this idea of high risk and high reward doesn't suit, you might be more interested in profitable, growing companies, like Regions Financial (NYSE:RF). Now this is not to say that the company presents the best investment opportunity around, but profitability is a key component to success in business. See our latest analysis for Regions Financial How Quickly Is Regions Financial Increasing Earnings Per Share?The market is a voting machine in the short term, but a weighing machine in the long term, so you'd expect share price to follow earnings per share (EPS) outcomes eventually. That makes EPS growth an attractive quality for any company. Regions Financial's shareholders have have plenty to be happy about as their annual EPS growth for the last 3 years was 52%. Growth that fast may well be fleeting, but it should be more than enough to pique the interest of the wary stock pickers.Top-line growth is a great indicator that growth is sustainable, and combined with a high earnings before interest and taxation (EBIT) margin, it's a great way for a company to maintain a competitive advantage in the market. It's noted that Regions Financial's revenue from operations was lower than its revenue in the last twelve months, so that could distort our analysis of its margins. While we note Regions Financial achieved similar EBIT margins to last year, revenue grew by a solid 10% to US$7.3b. That's a real positive.The chart below shows how the company's bottom and top lines have progressed over time.

You could base your opinion on past performance, of course, but you may also want to check this interactive graph of professional analyst EPS forecasts for Regions Financial.Are Regions Financial Insiders Aligned With All Shareholders?Since Regions Financial has a market capitalisation of US$19b, we wouldn't expect insiders to hold a large percentage of shares. But we are reassured by the fact they have invested in the company. Given insiders own a significant chunk of shares, currently valued at US$55m, they have plenty of motivation to push the business to succeed. This would indicate that the goals of shareholders and management are one and the same.Does Regions Financial Deserve A Spot On Your Watchlist?Regions Financial's earnings have taken off in quite an impressive fashion. That sort of growth is nothing short of eye-catching, and the large investment held by insiders should certainly brighten the view of the company. The hope is, of course, that the strong growth marks a fundamental improvement in the business economics. Based on the sum of its parts, we definitely think its worth watching Regions Financial very closely. You should always think about risks though. Case in point, we've spotted   1 warning sign for Regions Financial  you should be aware of.Although Regions Financial certainly looks good, it may appeal to more investors if insiders were buying up shares.

My name is Christine, and I will be your operator for today's call. (Operator Instructions) I will now turn the call over to Dana Nolan to begin.Dana NolanThank you, Christine. Welcome to Regions Second Quarter 2023 Earnings Call. John and David will provide high-level commentary regarding the quarter. Earnings documents, which include our forward-looking statement disclaimer and non-GAAP information are available in the Investor Relations section of our website. These disclosures cover our presentation materials, prepared comments and Q&amp;A. I will now turn the call over to John.John M. TurnerThank you, Dana, and good morning, everyone. We appreciate you joining our call today. Once again, Regions delivered another solid quarter, underscoring our commitment to generating consistent, sustainable long-term performance. We generated earnings of $556 million resulting in earnings per share of $0.59 and one of the best return on average tangible common equity ratios in our peer group at 24%. Our consistent strong earnings performance has given the board confidence to increase the quarterly common stock dividend by 20%, which was officially reported in a press release earlier this week. Although some lingering economic uncertainty remains, we feel good about our ability to carry this momentum into the second half of the year. We continue to benefit from our strong and diverse balance sheet, robust liquidity position, and prudent credit risk management. Our proactive hedging strategies have positioned us for success in any interest rate environment. And our granular deposit base and relationship-based banking approach continue to serve us well.Overall sentiment among our corporate customers remains relatively positive despite ongoing labor shortages, persistent inflationary pressure and slowly improving supply chain issues. In fact, most are continuing to forecast solid performance in 2023, although they are expecting modest declines from levels experienced in 2022. We remain committed to serving our customers while maintaining our focus on risk-adjusted returns. We're being judicious with capital, preserving it for our best clients and relationships. Year-to-date, the corporate bank has grown loans 2%, in line with our expectations with the vast majority of this growth coming from existing customers. Our consumer customers also remain healthy. Unemployment in 7 of our 8 top states remains at or near historical lows. And housing prices in 13 of our 15 states are forecast to outperform the HPI index in 2023. Wages in much of our footprint have kept pace with or exceeded increases in inflation. And as a result, consumer deposit balances and credit card payment rates remain higher than pre-pandemic levels.Our credit quality remains strong. Although normalization continues, charge-offs remain below historical through-the-cycle levels. We also continue to benefit from the strategic investments we're making in our business. For example, over the last few years, we focused on enhancing our treasury management suite of products and services. We've invested in talent and technology, including data and analytics, improving our ability to provide our clients with data-driven insights. Today, our relationship managers lead every prospective client conversation with a cash flow mindset, enabling us to clearly understand our customer needs. We are very pleased with the success of our treasury management business which has produced 13% revenue growth year-over-year. Although our penetration rate for treasury management solutions ranks among the top versus peers, we continue to see further opportunity in our existing customer base, particularly in lowering commercial. Additionally, during the second quarter, we introduced regions no-cost Overdraft Grace feature, giving consumers the opportunity to remedy overdrafts and avoid fees. To date, the data indicates that customers are seeing an approximate 30% reduction in the occurrence of assessed fees. We're excited about the financial benefits and flexibility, our customers are enjoying as a result of the changes we've made over the past 2 years. We also continue to actively search for investment opportunities with respect to mortgage servicing rights. And during the last 18 months, we've acquired the rights to service of approximately $23 billion in mortgage loans through a combination of bulk purchases and flow deals. These are just a few examples of our commitment to investing in markets, technology, talent and capabilities that grow and diversify our revenue base and enhance offerings to our customers. Now Dave will provide some highlights regarding the quarter.Story continuesDavid Jackson TurnerThank you, John. Let's start with the balance sheet. Average loans increased 1% sequentially. Average business loans also increased 1% reflecting high-quality, broad-based growth across the telecommunications, multifamily and energy industries. Loan demand remained stable during the quarter, and we had the opportunity to continue growing faster. However, as John mentioned, we are committed to appropriate risk-adjusted returns and now is not the time to stretch for growth. We are focused on supporting existing customers where we have a relationship and proven history. Approximately 84% of this quarter's business loan growth was driven by existing clients accessing and expanding their credit lines. Average consumer loans increased 1% as growth in mortgage and EnerBank was partially offset by declines in home equity and runoff exit portfolios. Looking forward, we expect 2023 ending loan growth of 3% to 4%. From a deposit standpoint, our deposit base remains a strength and a differentiating factor across the peer set with balances continuing to largely perform as expected. Our deposits are highly operational in nature, granular in size and generally receive more coverage through FDIC insurance than most peers. Although banking turmoil linked the first quarter introduced some additional uncertainty to the company's outlook, deposits largely performed as expected, ending the first half of the year down $4.8 billion.As part of our practice of maintaining a diversity of funding sources, total deposits include approximately $1 billion of deposits composed of brokered CDs and wholesale market transactions. Recall, this is in addition to the brokered CDs, we acquired as part of the EnerBank acquisition, which are maturing over time. Deposit declines came largely from higher balance and more rate-sensitive customers across all 3 businesses. We also saw continued diversification of customer dollars across various Regions offerings, such as from interest-free checking to CDs or money market deposits and movement out of deposits to offerings through our Wealth Management platform and in the corporate banking segment, utilization of off-balance sheet money market mutual fund solutions. In the case of corporate clients, overall liquidity under management has remained solid, increasing almost 3% since the end of the first quarter. Looking forward, a tightening Federal Reserve observed through increasing interest rates and reductions in the Federal Reserve's balance sheet, along with heightened competition will likely continue to constrain deposit growth for the industry through year-end. Accordingly, we expect deposits to be modestly lower over the balance of the year, and we expect the continued remixing into interest-bearing categories. So let's shift to net interest income and margin. As expected, net interest income declined by 2.5% in the second quarter. This represents the beginning of a reversion from elevated net interest income and margin levels back towards our longer-term range, mostly due to deposit and funding cost normalization. Regions' balance sheet remains asset sensitive. As the Federal Reserve nears the end of its tightening cycle, the net interest income is supported by elevated floating rate loan and cash yields at higher market interest rates and fixed rate asset turnover from the maturity of lower-yielding loans and securities. At this stage in the rate cycle, we expect deposit cost increases through a continuation of repricing and remixing trends. Importantly, recent trends remain within our expectation. The cycle-to-date deposit beta is 26%. And our guidance for 2023 is unchanged, a 35% cycle-to-date beta by year-end. Longer term, deposit performance will be heavily influenced by the amount of time monetary policy remains tight. Deposit betas could ultimately exceed the 35% in 2024 assuming higher rates for longer. Regardless, we remain confident that our deposit composition will provide a meaningful competitive advantage for Regions when compared to the broader industry. Net interest income is projected to grow between 12% and 14% in 2023 when compared to 2022. The midpoint of the range is supported using June 30 market forward interest rates or approximately 1 additional 25 basis point hike this year. Third quarter net interest income is expected to decline approximately 5%, driven by continued deposit and funding cost normalization and the beginning of the active hedging period for a number of previously transacted forward-starting receive fixed swaps. The balance sheet hedging program is an important source of earnings stability in today's uncertain environment. Hedges added to date create a well-protected net interest margin profile through 2025. While no meaningful hedging was transacted during the quarter, we continue to look for opportunities to add balance sheet protection beyond 2025 at attractive market rate levels. Since quarter end, we have added $1 billion of forward starting swaps and $500 million of forward starting rate collars, near recent highs that will become effective in 2026, 2027 and 2028. The resulting balance sheet is constructed to support a net interest margin range of 3.6% to 4% over the coming years, even if interest rates move back towards 1%. If rates remain elevated, our net interest margin is projected to remain at or above the midpoint of the range. Let's take a look at fee revenue and expense. Adjusted noninterest income increased 8% from the prior quarter as increases in capital markets and card and ATM fees were partially offset by declines in other categories. Total capital markets income increased $26 million. Excluding the impact of CVA and DVA, capital markets increased 3% sequentially, driven primarily by growth in real estate capital markets, partially offset by declines in M&amp;A fees, debt underwriting and loan syndication income. We had a negative $9 million CVA and DVA adjustment, reflecting credit spread tightening during the quarter. However, this was a $24 million improvement versus the first quarter. Card and ATM fees increased 7%, driven by seasonally higher spend and transaction volume as well as a first quarter $5 million rewards reserve adjustment that did not repeat.Service charges declined slightly during the quarter. As John mentioned, we introduced our Overdraft Grace feature in mid-June. Based on our experience to date, we now expect full year service charges of approximately $575 million. With respect to outlook, we continue to expect full year 2023 adjusted total revenue to be up 6% to 8% compared to 2022.Let's move on to noninterest expense. Adjusted noninterest expense increased 8% compared to the prior quarter and includes the previously announced elevated operating losses related to check fraud. Excluding the approximately $80 million associated with incremental check fraud incurred this quarter, adjusted noninterest expenses remained relatively stable versus the prior quarter. We have effective countermeasures in place and losses have returned to normalized levels. Salaries and benefits decreased 2%, primarily due to lower payroll taxes and 401(k) expense partially offset by an entire quarter of annual merit increases and higher headcount. The FDIC insurance assessment increase was driven by changes in various inputs, including normalized credit conditions and increases in average assets. We remain committed to prudently managing expenses in order to continue funding investments in our business, including optimizing square footage. As an example, this quarter, we entered into an agreement to sell 2 of our largest operation centers, totaling over 450,000 square feet. We will continue to refine our expense base, focusing on our largest categories, which include salaries and benefits, occupancy and vendor spend. We expect full year 2023 adjusted noninterest expenses to be up approximately 6.5% and continue to expect to generate positive adjusted operating leverage. From an asset quality standpoint, overall credit performance continues to normalize as expected. Net charge-offs were 33 basis points in the quarter. Nonperforming loans decreased while business service criticized loans and total delinquencies increased. Provision expense was $118 million or $37 million in excess of net charge-offs. The allowance for credit loss ratio increased 2 basis points to 1.65% and the allowance as a percentage of nonperforming loans increased to 332%. The allowance increased due primarily to normalizing credit, modest economic outlook changes and loan growth. Allowance for credit losses on the office portfolio increased from 2.2% in to 2.7%. Importantly, the single office loan on nonperforming status is paying as agreed. Additionally, the vast majority of our office exposure is in Class A properties, located primarily within the Sunbelt. Overall, we continue to feel good about the composition of our office book and do not expect any meaningful loss in this portfolio. While we expect net charge-offs will continue to normalize over the back half of the year, we continue to expect our full year 2023 net charge-off ratio to be approximately 35 basis points. We also expect to return to our historical through-the-cycle annual charge-off range of 35 to 45 basis points in 2024. From a capital standpoint, we ended the quarter with a common equity Tier 1 ratio at an estimated 10.1%. Although we were not required to participate in this year's supervisory capital stress test, we did receive our preliminary Stress Capital Buffer reflecting planned capital changes, including the dividend increase John referenced. Our preliminary Stress Capital Buffer will remain at 2.5% from the fourth quarter of 2023 through the third quarter of 2024. Additionally, we have access to sources of liquidity at June 30, totaling approximately $53 billion including collateral we have in a ready status at the Federal Home Loan Bank, the Federal Reserve's Bank Term funding program and the discount window. These sources are sufficient to cover all retail uninsured deposits plus wholesale nonoperational deposits by approximately a 3:1 ratio. Given current macroeconomic conditions, and regulatory uncertainty, we anticipate continuing to manage capital levels at or modestly above 10% over the near term.And finally, we have a slide summarizing our expectations which we have addressed throughout the prepared comments. With that, we'll move to the Q&amp;A portion of the call.Question and Answer SessionOperator(Operator Instructions)Our first question comes from the line of Scott Siefers with Piper Sandler.Robert Scott SiefersJust wanted to ask a little on the deposit pricing thoughts. So you kept the interest-bearing deposit beta assumption, which was great, but softened the deposit growth expectation a bit. Maybe a thought or 2 on how you're thinking about the balance between flows and pricing. And then when we think about that beta assumption potentially going higher into next year as you had suggested vis-a-vis the third -- current 35% expectation. What are sort of the major puts and takes as you think about it? I mean, obviously, sort of time is a big one, but would just be curious to hear your thoughts.David Jackson TurnerSure. This is David. So with regards to deposit pricing, it's important that I understand that we think about our customers, we talk to our business leaders in terms of what we need to do to support our customer base and what's going on from a competitive landscape. And so through that, we form an opinion as to what our deposit beta ought to be. And I would tell you that going into last quarter, we've had 35% beta now for -- since the beginning of the year. We had a little bit cushion in that, we believe, pretty conservative. Based on what we've seen and the competitive pressures that we've seen, and obviously, events of March 8, it's probably not as conservative. We believe it's the right number, but we don't have as much conservatism in it as we had.With regards to what we're thinking about beta going into 2024, we really need to understand what the Fed is thinking. And right now, if they have one more increase and kind of stay on hold for a while. You probably have a couple of quarters before betas stopped creeping up on you. So we had originally called for the end of the cycle at the end 2023 because this has been elongated a bit, the cycle is going to continue into 2024 to some degree. And that's all dependent on when they stop. And so if they have one more increase at the next meeting, it will be sooner, if they keep going another increase after that, it will be later. So those are probably the biggest individual drivers. You have other things like competition, whether we have to be competitive. And so what our competition does, we have to react to, to some degree. So that's another driver. And then the overall Fed balance sheet. So the Fed is down about $800 billion since the beginning of the year, Fed -- the balance sheet is going to continue to drift down a little bit, which will take liquidity out of the system and put some pressure on there. So there are several things. That's why it's hard to be precise on what the beta is going to be. But I think there should be some expectation that there's a little bit of an increase in 2024, the amount of which we can't tell you precisely, we'll continue to look and search for that and update you as we change our opinion on that.Robert Scott SiefersAnd then I wanted to ask just a super quick one on sort of the background behind the favorable $25 million adjustment you made to the expected full year service charges number. It sounds like it's simply a better understanding based on the early observations from the rollout of the new -- but would love to hear any incremental color you have there as well, please.David Jackson TurnerYes, it actually wasn't that. The driver is because our -- what's embedded in the service charge is also treasury management. And our treasury management group has done a great job this year growing relationships. We're up about 9% of our relationships. And if you look at revenue, our revenue on treasury management is up some 13%. And so we saw that happen in the first part -- the first quarter. We want to see if it continued, it did in the second quarter. And so our service charge from 24-hour grace is about what we -- where we forecasted it. So you add all that together and just on a run rate basis, you can see we were going to be higher than what we had originally guided, and that was the single driver.OperatorOur next question comes from the line of Gerard Cassidy with RBC.Gerard Sean CassidyDavid, can you share with us -- I know we don't know what the final outcomes will be from the regulatory changes that are on the horizon, possibly we get them next week. But can you share with us how you guys are thinking about how it might impact you in terms of the long-term debt portion of the TLAC as well as the higher risk-weighted asset assumptions possibly for mortgages, which came out, I think, this week. And any other issues that are surrounding this whole regulatory change that's on the horizon.David Jackson TurnerSure. So let me just give you an overall comment, then I'll break down some of the elements. So overall, Gerard, what we're hearing, what we're seeing, we can -- we'll be able to adapt and overcome whatever it is that we have to. We think the Fed is going to give us all time to adapt to whatever those changes are going to be without any major disruption.So specifically on debt, we're hearing potentially a 6% of RWA number for those over $100 million. Maybe there's some tailoring, but let's just use the 6% for easy math. That's an incremental $5 billion of debt for us that we'll have to raise over time. We'll be able to leverage that $5 billion into our business and including putting some of it at the bank that will reduce our deposit insurance premium some. And when you wrap all that together, you're talking about 60 to 70 basis points of all-in cost for us on that $5 billion. So you're talking about $35 million bottom line hit if that were to happen, fully implemented. So it's just not -- it's not something that's pretty easy to overcome. We don't think it's necessary, but we don't get to make the rules. We just have to adapt and overcome.With regards to the RWA, so we're hearing conflicting things. There's clearly some additional operational risk we're going to have to put into RWAs. We're supposed to get some benefit, though, on the credit side, whether that be from mortgages or investment grade. If all that happens like Basel intended, then it's a push and no big deal. On the other hand, if we don't get the benefits we're supposed to on the credit risk weights, then that will cost us a little bit of capital. And again, we'll feather that in over time. Outside of Basel, but probably part of the NPR that will be coming out will be AOCI. AOCI is likely to be in the capital regime going forward, which, on a stress basis, actually is helpful because your AOCI is in a gain position. But in a rising rate environment, which is good for banking because that's where we make most of our money. From a capital standpoint, you'll have to feather that AOCI in over time. Again, they're talking about starting maybe in 2025 or 2026 and then giving you 3 to 5 years to do that. And again, we can -- we'll be able to handle that. Some of that takes care of itself just because of the maturities of the investment portfolio. And so -- and then rates coming down the other way. So again, the bottom line is where I started, whatever it is, we'll adapt and overcome.Gerard Sean CassidyVery good. And then I think you guys mentioned that you sold a couple of operation centers or you're in agreement to sell a couple of operation centers. I didn't hear, are you going to vacate them as well? Or is it just more of a sales leaseback situation? And then second, the price you received for them, how does that compare to what they may have been valued a couple of years ago at...David Jackson TurnerYes. So the first part is we will lease one of the buildings back some of the square footage for a relatively short period of time to help us transition. But for the most part, we're going to be vacating both of those buildings. I mean the world has changed since we built all of that. And so we just don't need the space. And of course, working remotely has been a piece of that, too. So we think it's a good deal, not only for our customer base, but for our community because what's going there, we think, will be very helpful to the community. We're going to be able to get out of -- sell that. It will be [right at] book value to a slight gain on the sale, not anything to write home about, but we'll make a little bit of money on that.Gerard Sean CassidyAnd David, was the values lower than what you think if you would have sold those 2 or 3 years ago? Just to tie into the whole commercial real estate lower values that we're hearing about.John M. TurnerYes. Gerard, it's John. I'm not sure it's a relevant question. We're selling to the taxing authority that -- so we're selling to the city that we occupied and our tax valuation was unchanged over the 3-year period. And so it's based on tax valuation. So I'm not sure that we can give you a good answer to your question.OperatorOur next question comes from the line of Ken Usdin with Jefferies.Kenneth Michael UsdinDavid, just wondering your expectations for deposits to go down a little bit towards the end of the year, and you mentioned the additions of some of those brokered CDs. I'm just wondering what you think of the trajectory for average earning assets from here, if the [right side] is kind of coming down a little bit in loan growth, you've kind of given your clear view of that and just wondering how that fits in with the securities and cash in between in terms of what AAA does.David Jackson TurnerYes. I think you'll see a modest decline there, Ken. I think the deposit decline normalization. Remember, we had a lot of surge deposits. We've been calling for run off a bit. We were pretty close to our number through the second quarter. Rates are higher or longer. I think that's going to have some switching costs associated with it. There's going to be some off-balance sheet movement as well. We think our noninterest-bearing drifts down to that mid-30s, which is what we've been calling for. I think today, we're at about 37%.So as a result of that decline, you should expect average earning assets to decline along with that. When we talk about modestly, we're talking 1% to 2%, frankly. And -- but we'll see. We're continuing to grow checking accounts. The core of our franchise are checking accounts and operating accounts, and we are all over trying to grow that and take advantage of the markets that we're in, which is very favorable as we see the migration of people and businesses into our markets. So we think this is some more normalization and then we think it kind of settles out after that modest decline.Kenneth Michael UsdinGreat. Okay. Got it. And just on the loan side, I was just wondering, resi mortgage and EnerBank have been the biggest parts of your loan growth for a while now. Just wondering, is that continue to be your expectation of where you'll get the majority of growth? And within that, I guess, if you can just give us an update on how EnerBank has been doing relative to your expectations.David Jackson TurnerSure. So our growth has really driven thus far in total from the commercial side. That is going to slow a bit. We can just -- as we talk to customers, we could see the demand for credit isn't quite what it was. Obviously, there are transactions that are harder to get done in real estate because we are based on the -- where rates are, we're requiring more equity in the deal and developers don't want to do that. So things don't happen. There's still a big demand for housing, our resi portfolio will continue to grow some. We have a good group of MLOs that are out there. The housing supply is still way below where it should be. Now rates are up. And so that's going to mute things. From an EnerBank standpoint, we've had pretty good growth. They have met the expectations that we have laid out for them. We'll see some slowing a bit in the second half and into 2024. We had a pretty big solar program going at one time. The math on that got to a point where it was not as profitable as we had originally hoped for. And so we are not going to change -- chase loan growth until -- unless we can get paid appropriately for the risk that we take. As a result, that's going to slow a bit and EnerBank. That being said, we're very happy with what they're doing and you're going to see growth just not at the pace that we have had.OperatorOur next question comes from the line of Dave Rochester with Compass Point.David Patrick RochesterOn your NII guide, I was just wondering about the timing of the rate hike you're factoring in there. It sounded like you're assuming July. I just wanted to confirm that. And then on your deposit comments, that you're factoring in that decline further on the DDA side and just overall, was just wondering what the rough average cost is of that incremental deposits that you're bringing in to replace some of that DDA? What's your assumption there? Is it 5%, 5.5%? Or is it closer to maybe some of your lower core accounts?David Jackson TurnerYes, it's right at 5%. And you're correct, we did factor in the increase -- rate increase in July.David Patrick RochesterOkay. Great. Maybe on capital, the plan to manage CET1 at or slightly above 10%. Given you're there now, I just wanted to get your thoughts on the chances of your restarting the buyback once you get more clarity on the capital requirements next week? Or do you think there's maybe a better possibility that you restart that in 4Q?David Jackson TurnerIt's probably more likely a 4Q. We keep thinking we're going to get clarification. We thought June 30 has been pushed out. So we don't know exactly when we're going to get it. But whatever we do, we'll shift through the material and we'll come up with an appropriate plan. Until we know that plan, it just doesn't make any sense. I mean we had, I think, the highest return this quarter on tangible common equity. There's just no need for us to push on the -- to push on share buyback right now. Let's just be a little bit cautious and deal with the rules. And then after that, if buying our shares back is appropriate, then that's what we'll do.David Patrick RochesterOkay. And maybe one, last one on credit. Just wanted to get your thoughts on your office reserve ratio at this point. I know you don't know what's in the other office books out there, some of these other banks, but we're just seeing some reserve ratios that are a little bit more elevated at some of the larger banks. And I know you mentioned you don't expect any losses in that book. I was just hoping you could just talk a little bit more about what's giving you comfort with that the 2 handle that you've got on there right now on the reserve ratio.John M. TurnerSure, yes. This is John. I'll answer that. So our office portfolio is about $1.7 billion, roughly 36% of that portfolio is single tenant. And of that single tenant exposure, 82% is investment grade. So we sort of look at that $700 million and feel like we understand that. It's well secured, it's performing. So then we look at the $1 billion portfolio that remains that's multi-tenant, 63% of that is in the Sunbelt. Beyond that, it is well diversified geographically. Largest concentration we have is in the Dallas-Fort Worth market, where about 20% of the portfolio, our exposure actually resides. There are about 100 credits make up that $1 billion. So we have very good visibility into the relationships and to the performance of those particular credits. When I think about how we're doing, we've been talking to customers well in advance of maturities, and we have a fair number of maturities in 2023 and 2024. Performance to date has been good. We've had 13 credits that have matured already this year and over half of those or half of those credits had an extension option, which they were able to exercise. Another 20-plus percent renewed based on our current credit underwriting standards and the balance either paid off. We have one credit that we're still working on. That's the one nonaccrual that we have in the portfolio. And so all in all, our assessment of our portfolio, our office portfolio is pretty good. We have said we don't think we have any significant losses in the portfolio, and that's been confirmed by, again, conversations we're having with customers, our visibility into what's occurred to date and what we think will occur over the next 12 to 18 months.OperatorOur next question comes from the line of Matt O'Connor with Deutsche Bank.Matthew Derek O'ConnorCan you guys just remind us where you are on the system (inaudible) on the loan and deposit platforms and what the benefits are once that's done?David Jackson TurnerYes. So we are in the formative stage of putting in our new systems focusing on the deposit system. It will be the biggest and all of them are important to us, but that was really important to us. We are planning right now, we're laying the foundation. We are spending some money. We've been spending money for quite some time. But you're not going to see benefits for a number of years, Matt. We've got to go through. And we've learned from talking to others that have gone through these type journeys is, it is much better to take your time and be planful. It will reduce -- ultimately it will reduce overall cost. So we're going through a number of customer journeys and really thinking through not just putting in a new system, but how can we really transform, how we do business and how can we make it easier for our customers to bank with us, how we can make it easier for our associates to take care of our customers. And so it's a lot of work. And so you're going to see cost upfront which is what we're experiencing today before you'll see the benefits, it will be a few years out.Matthew Derek O'ConnorAnd remind us of the time line, I think it was back in 2019, you first started talking about it, I thought you said it might be 5 or 6 years, but update us on the time line, please?David Jackson TurnerThat's right. It's going to be another 5 years from now before you see this. So we have a deposit system, we'll be putting in a new commercial loan system, and we'll be putting in a consumer loan system as well. But the biggest one and the most expensive one will be the deposit system. But that's at least 3 years out before that gets put in.OperatorOur next question comes from the line of Erika Najarian with UBS.Erika NajarianQuick question. Question is clarifying sort of the statements on NII, David. So based on your guidance, the fourth quarter 2023 net interest income quote exit rate will be somewhere between $1.31 billion and $1.32 billion. Sort of based on what you're telling us, should we expect perhaps a step down in the first quarter due to day count. And like you said, the continuation of beta creep, but then would there be stability from there or an opportunity for reprice if the Fed cuts? I'm trying to just triangulate your comments on NIM, which are very helpful to the NII quarterly cadence.David Jackson TurnerYes. So I won't confirm your number exactly, but your thinking is spot on that as we get to the end of the year, we start stabilizing a bit. The question is, where does the Fed stop. If they go one more time and stop then you're -- then the only thing you really have leading into the first quarter will be slight beta risk and the day count that you talked about. So I think you have stability from there on. However, if the Fed continues to push this out even more and has to go 2, 3 -- 2 more hikes, 3 more hikes and you just push everything out. We do have hedges that are becoming live this quarter. You can see that on our Page 6 in our deck. And so we put those on over a year ago with anticipation that there was risk that rates actually roll over and start going down, they didn't. And so we'll be in a bit of a negative carry on those, which is okay because the rest of our book is earning a whole lot more money than we thought at that time. So that's all been factored in to the guidance that we gave you. And we're -- right now, we're expecting that we get to the end of the year and things really start to settle out with the exception of minor tweaks in that first quarter.Erika NajarianGot it. And could you remind us sort of how much in total is the check fraud as you have in your expense base for 2023. And as we think about your natural (technical difficulty) run rate?David Jackson TurnerYes. So we have a schedule in our supplement on it. Let me flip and see if I can find it real quick for you because we were anticipating this question. We wanted to give everybody an understanding. It's on Page 15 of the supplement. And it's embedded in the operational loss number, and that change related to check fraud, was about $80 million, as we mentioned in the call. But you can see our operational losses had averaged about $13 million to $18 million per quarter, and we are back to that kind of run rate now. And so we expect to be there about that number going forward.Erika NajarianGot it. And if I could just squeeze one more in, and this is for John. We're sitting here now July 21, 2023, and your firm is in a position of great strength. I'm wondering -- and I'm asking about organic opportunities. I don't think I'm wrapping an M&amp;A question around this. But as you think about [as you] go on more stringent RWA diet -- than you -- given where your capital is today, how are you thinking about playing offense as we think through all the changes. How do you leverage that deposit base that will stay inexpensive and the capital that seems to be building nicely in the credit that seems relatively stable.John M. TurnerErika, we're continuing to add talent. So we're continuing to hire talent. We're in some very good markets. We have acquired a number of capabilities over the last number of years. And so it's really combining talent with opportunity in markets with additional capabilities, just to execute our plan. We're asking our bankers to be active in markets, talking to customers and noncustomers looking for ways to expand our business while there's still some economic uncertainty, and we want to be prudent and careful. We start with soundness first, followed by profitability and then growth. We think we are in a position, as you pointed out to win market share, where opportunities exist and we're focused on those prospects that we've been calling on for a long time and relationships that we've had for a long time to ensure that we use the capital and the resources we have to support those companies as they want to grow their businesses.David Jackson TurnerYes, Erika, this is David. Let me add to that. So we do realize there could be opportunities for us to grow loans faster than what we just gave you the guidance on. So we gave a guidance of 3% to 4%. We produced that slightly because of the demand that I had talked about earlier. We want to grow relationships. We aren't interested in taking advantage of somebody's RWA diet and growing loans only. We cannot outstrip our funding base because that marginal profitability just won't be there if you're having to wholesale fund that growth. So if we can get a relationship that brings an operating account and other deposits, we're all over that. But we're not interested in just growing loans because somebody else wants to shed that risk.OperatorOur next question comes from the line of Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley.Betsy Lynn GraseckYes, just a ticky-tacky one at this stage. AOCI, pull-to-par, what should we be thinking about with regard to how that's going to pull quarterly over the next 4, 6 quarters?David Jackson TurnerYes. I think we have a schedule in the back is on our Slide #17 that shows by the end of 2024, about 25% of that will be rolled in. And then by the end of the next year, about 39%. That's using just maturities in the forwards at this time.Betsy Lynn GraseckOkay. And that's on just the AFS book, obviously, right?David Jackson TurnerThat's correct.Betsy Lynn GraseckAnd then your strategy for the security portfolio in general. Are you going to be adding to it over time? Or what are you doing with the excess deposit growth that you get?David Jackson TurnerYes. So we've historically been 18% to 20% of our earning assets and securities. We suspect we'll be roughly in that range. What we have to think through is what the new regime will be with regards to AOCI. As you're probably aware, the AOCI changes with regards to securities becomes part of your capital, but the fair market value changes with regards to derivatives is not. And so what that does is it causes you to at least think about, if we need the duration protection that we use our securities book for along with liquidity. That perhaps we use more derivatives than securities. And we'll just have to see. But I don't see that changing our securities book appreciably, will it be down a notch or 2 perhaps. But I don't think you would -- you should expect us to grow that book much past that 20% range.OperatorOur final question comes from the line of John Pancari with Evercore.John G. PancariBack to the deposit beta. I know you indicated the potential for an increase in 2024 if rates remain elevated. Any way to help us size it up, and does the 35 go to 40, is that most likely if we are in a higher longer environment? Or could it be up there where some of your competitors are flagging in the mid-40s and maybe even up there in the 50s where some of them are at. Just curious if you can help us frame it out.Unidentified Company RepresentativeJohn, this is Darren Smith. I'll take that one. So I think you're in the right neighborhood. Our expectations would be that if the Fed is indeed done over the next couple of meetings. And then what you're seeing is just that residual beta creep that plays out over a couple of quarters, and then you have very modest increases from there. It obviously depends on how long we're at that level. But I think somewhere in the upper 30s to around 40% is reasonable in terms of how much it may continue to move.John G. PancariGot it, Darren. That's helpful (inaudible). And then separately, just back to Matt O'Connor's question on the systems conversion. Can you remind us of your expectation around the cost of the conversion? I know you had originally indicated that you don't expect it to impact your IT budget. Is that still the case? Or has it -- has that changed as you have (inaudible) on a vendor, et cetera?David Jackson TurnerYes. So John, we're still in the formative stage of planning for that. I'll tell you there's a lot of things going on other than this -- the system integration with regards to technology. The environment is changing to Software-as-a-Service versus buying a system and capitalizing it depreciating that over time and skipping several of the upgrades because you don't want to pay for that. Today, it's all going in the cloud. It's paying by the drink and that's more expensive. And it's -- so technology cost, it used to be technology costs go down over time. It does not appear to be the case. We're going to do our best to control that while making appropriate investments in technology because I think we can leverage that better than we do today. We use a lot of human capital to do things. I think over time, you're going to see most everybody leveraging technology better. And so I think that right now, we're at 9% to 11% of total revenue. I can see that drifting higher a bit over time. But right now, that's our call of 9% to 11%. And we'll update you as things change.John G. PancariAnd then 9% or 11% is the total IT budget?David Jackson TurnerAll technology, yes.John M. TurnerOkay. Well, I think that's all the calls. So I appreciate everybody's participation today. Thank you for your interest in Regions. Have a great weekend.OperatorThis concludes today's teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time.]"

""We don't think it's necessary, but we don't get to make the rules. We just have to adapt and overcome."" Credit: Adobe StockRegions Financial says that it is planning for an increase in regulatory capital requirements and would be able to manage new regulations for risk-weighted assets, but it also said that raising the capital threshold is unnecessary.David Turner, chief financial officer of the $156 billion-asset bank, told analysts Friday during the company's second-quarter earnings presentation that Regions was expecting effective minimum capital standards to rise, and is preparing for a 6% risk-weighted asset requirement for banks over $100 billion of assets.""Maybe there's some tailoring,"" Turner said, but based on a 6% threshold, Regions would need to raise an ""incremental"" $5 billion of debt. The potential capital requirement would create an ""all-in cost"" for Regions of around $35 million or a ""bottom-line hit"" of 60 to 70 basis points, he said.""It's not something that is pretty easy to overcome,"" Turner told analysts. ""We don't think it's necessary, but we don't get to make the rules. We just have to adapt and overcome.""The potential changes Turner was referencing could be part of a Federal Reserve proposal expected next week related to the final implementation of the Basel III international regulatory framework, also known as the Basel III endgame. The Fed has scheduled an open meeting to discuss it Thursday.A series of bank failures that began earlier this year with the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank in March has prompted regulatory discussion led by the Federal Reserve, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp.Policymakers and banking industry officials have debated back and forth about whether and by how much existing rules should be toughened to better insulate regional banks in particular from financial or economic shocks.Key issues of the debate have circled around raising certain capital requirements to include banks with assets of $100 billion or more and whether additional regulation would increase the cost of capital at traditional banks and tilt market activity toward less-regulated nonbank lenders.Story continuesThe Birmingham, Alabama, bank will be able to ""overcome whatever it is that we have to [meet]"" if regulators enact new capital requirements, Turner said during Friday's earnings call.""We think the Fed's going to give us all the time to adapt to whatever those changes are going to be without any major disruption,"" Turner said.Regions was among the hardest-hit regional lenders amid sudden deposit runoffs and other volatility that slammed the sector earlier this year. At the end of the first quarter, Regions reported a 2.5% decline in deposits since the end of last year and a 9% drop from the first quarter of 2022.The bank's total deposits declined further in the second quarter — to $127 billion — but at a slower pace. Deposits at June 30 were 1% lower than on March 31 and 8% lower than in mid-2022.An analyst's question to Regions about its exposure to office-related commercial real estate assets highlighted ongoing concerns about underlying risks that could be present throughout the banking industry.The bank holds a $1.7 billion office portfolio, which consists of ""well-secured"" single-tenant assets with 82% considered investment-grade, Regions CEO John Turner told analysts.He said that the bank's multi-tenant office assets are based mostly in Sun Belt states and are ""well diversified geographically.""Regions reported net income of $581 million at the end of the second quarter, which was a 5% decline from the first quarter and flat compared with the same period last year. Net interest income fell by 2.5% during the second quarter to $1.4 billion but increased by 25% compared with the year-earlier period.Noninterest income climbed by 8% to $576 million during the second quarter but declined by 10% compared with the second quarter of 2022. Regions cited gains in its capital markets and credit card businesses that were offset by declines in other categories which include service charges on deposit accounts.]"

The bottom line was flat with the prior-year quarter.Shares of RF gained 1.6% in the pre-market trading on revenue growth. A full-day trading session will depict a clearer picture.Results have been aided by a rise in net interest income (NII) and average loan balances. However, increasing expenses and provision for credit losses affected the bottom line.Net income available to common shareholders was $556 million, down year over year from $558 million.Revenues Improve, Expenses RiseTotal quarterly revenues were $1.96 billion, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.94 billion.

Also, the net interest margin rose 98 basis points to 4.04%.Non-interest income dipped 10% year over year to $576 million. The downside mainly resulted from lower service charges on deposit accounts, capital market income, mortgage income, and card and ATM fees.Non-interest expenses rose 17.2% year over year to $1.11 billion.

V is scheduled to release its fiscal third quarter of 2023 results on Jul 25, after the closing bell. The focal point of the payments technology company’s earnings release will be its payments volume and transactions growth. Higher year-over-year transactions during the quarter under discussion are likely to enhance results.Also read: (Can Visa's Q3 Earnings Beat on Higher US Payment Levels?) to find out how the company’s overall fiscal third quarter performance is expected to have been.As the company's activities are heavily interrelated, it has one reportable segment, Payment Services. Under this segment, it has four primary revenue lines: Service, Data Processing, International Transaction and Other revenues. It offers a wide range of Visa-branded payment products, which diversifies its earnings source.Q2 HighlightsIn the last reported quarter, the company’s payments volume (the primary driver of Service revenues) jumped 6.4% year over year on a nominal basis to $2,955 billion. While credit programs grew 8.5% year over year to about $1,486 billion, debit programs witnessed a 4.3% increase to around $1,468 billion. Operations in the United States and Latin America were among the major growth drivers.Also, Visa’s total processed transactions (the key catalyst for Data Processing revenues) in the previous quarter witnessed an 11.7% year-over-year increase to 50.1 billion.Forecast for Q3 PerformanceThe continuous migration to the digital form of payments and Visa’s expansion of service offerings are expected to have played a significant role in boosting its fiscal third-quarter results. The ongoing economic volatility and high interest rate environment are expected to have affected payments and transaction volumes in the quarter under review. However, the company’s ability to strike new deals, renew agreements and its accretive acquisitions are likely to have helped it to expand its network.The network expansion enables V to garner more and more transaction volumes despite macroeconomic headwinds. This is likely to get reflected in the upcoming quarterly results. Our estimate for fiscal third quarter processed transactions indicates more than 4% year-over-year growth. As such, we expect its Data Processing revenues for the June quarter to jump 10% year over year.Story continuesOur estimate for total transactions in the quarter indicates more than 5% year-over-year growth, supported by increased payments transactions, partially offset by declining cash transactions.Our estimate for payments volumes suggests around 6% year-over-year growth on a nominal basis to $3,118 billion for the fiscal third quarter. Considering operations by regions, Latin America, Canada and the United States are expected to have been major growth drivers in this period. However, the positives are likely to have been impacted by declines in CEMEA and overall Europe operations.While credit programs are expected to have offered more than 8% year-over-year growth to payments volume, debit programs are likely to have contributed an almost 4% rise in the quarter under review. Our estimate for Service revenues for the quarter is pegged at $3,696.4 million, suggesting an increase from $3,189 million a year ago.Overall Projections for Q3The Zacks Consensus Estimate for total revenues is pegged at $8.1 billion, suggesting a 10.7% year-over-year jump. The consensus estimate for adjusted earnings per share stands at $2.10, which suggests a 6.1% increase from the year-ago tally of $1.98.Visa beat earnings estimates in all the trailing four quarters, delivering an average of 8%.Our proven model predicts a likely earnings beat for Visa this time around as well. The combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) increases the chances of an earnings beat, which is precisely the case here.Visa has an Earnings ESP of +0.53% and currently carries a Zacks Rank #3.You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Visa Inc.

If you want to see more stocks in this selection, check out 5 Under-the-Radar Stocks That Are on The Move.Valuations in the US equity market appear overstretched in the aftermath of stocks registering one of the best runs in the first six months of the year. Consequently, the race for stocks likely to deliver better-than-expected gains heading into yearend is heating up. The likes of Visa Inc. (NYSE:V) and Mastercard Incorporated (NYSE:MA) are increasingly emerging as some of the best plays as they show signs of breaking out after rallying to 52-week highs.The impressive run in the market depicted by the S&amp;P 500 rallying by more than 19%, Nasdaq by more than 30% year to date has been fueled by stocks that enjoy mass support. In addition, the stocks behind the rally are mostly of companies with unique elements of reliability and predictability. Unknown to most people is that under-the-radar stocks on the move could deliver better-than-expected gains because of their lack of predictability.It's common for investors to get hung up on big boys like Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) as they receive the biggest share of Wall Street attention. Therefore, their stock prices tend to react instantly, even on the smallest news.However, if you do not have an informational edge over other investors, generating value from the stocks might be difficult. Additionally, the initial investment capital in some of the stocks is usually high as some trade at a premium.To compensate for this mishap, it is common for investors to seek haven in under-the-radar stocks that are often not given the much-needed attention. While some are in less known industries, some are of smaller companies with solid, long-term prospects.While investing in under-the-radar stocks, having a long-term mindset to safeguard one's holdings from temporary headwinds is better. Additionally, such stocks offer a great way of diversifying an investment portfolio.Story continuesInvesting in under the radar stocks offers a great opportunity to invest in companies before they become household names. The investment can pay off on getting in early before the heard joins and fuels a significant move to the upside.The best under-the-radar stocks are mostly companies with a competitive edge, be it in the financial sector, tech, all even the industrial sector. For instance, some stocks were able to navigate the banking crisis early in the year to generate significant returns. On the other hand, stocks are well poised to do, even with the US economy's recession.12 Under-the-Radar Stocks That Are on The MoveSource: UnsplashAccording to CIC Wealth Executive Vice President Malcolm Ethridge, Mastercard and Visa are some of the stocks that sit well in the financial sector as they handle almost every credit card transaction in the US. While the focus has been on JPMorgan, especially on delivering better-than-expected Q2 results, Malcolm believes the two-payment processing company boasts a recession-proof model as they are embedded in every transaction worldwide.While investing in any stock, it's vital to look beyond the company's share price at that moment. The focus should always be on the underlying business at hand and its long-term prospects. Therefore, there might be better under-the-radar stock than the best under-the-radar stock. Instead, it is of companies with strong leadership, competitive advantage in their respective industries, strong financials, and solid paths to future growth.Our MethodologyWe used Finviz's stock screener to select the 12 under-the-radar stocks.

While the companies have excelled since we invested, rising rates have caused contract cancellations to explode higher and their construction backlog to shrink significantly. Compared to the Q1 of the prior year, Lennar’s 2023 Q1 saw a 33% decrease in construction backlog and a 18% decline in new orders (by dollar value). The cancellation rate increased to 21% from 10% last year2. While both homebuilders are still quite profitable and well-run, we wanted to exit before they are impacted by an impending recession.

The Biden officials listened to the presentations but didn’t make any commitments, said the people, who asked not to be identified because the talks were private.The chip industry is trying to navigate increasing tensions between China and the US. Companies are being forced to curb shipments to their largest market by Washington, which has cited national security concerns about the Asian nation acquiring certain capabilities. One of the executives against current rules restricting the export of artificial intelligence hardware to China, saying the policy hasn’t achieved the intended outcome of slowing China’s AI development.The Biden team has been exploring ways to further tighten existing curbs — for example, by targeting chips made by Nvidia specifically for the China market, according to people familiar with the matter. In addition to the US restrictions, US chipmakers such as Micron Technology Inc. have faced actions by Beijing that have hurt their ability to do business in the country.Representatives for the three companies declined to comment, as did a spokesman for the National Security Council.US National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan said Friday he agreed with the executives that the approach needs to be a “small yard, high fence” — effective but limited. He defended the administration’s actions to date as just that, saying the measures were targeted and had virtually no impact on US-China trade for most chips.Story continues“The vast majority of sales of chips designed by the United States to China has continued unabated,” he said at the Aspen Security Forum. “It continues to this day.”He hinted that more curbs could follow but that they would only be implemented after robust discussion with the affected companies.“We are going to continue to look at very targeted, very specific restrictions on technology with national security and military applications and make judgments rigorously, carefully, methodically — and, yes, in deep consultation with our private sector,” he said.During the discussion on Monday, Intel’s Gelsinger told Sullivan, Secretary of State Antony Blinken and other officials that further restricting what his company does in China puts at risk a key Biden policy of bringing back chip production to the US, the people said.Without orders from Chinese customers, there will be much less need to go ahead with projects such as Intel’s planned factory complex in Ohio, the executive said, according to the people. Nvidia’s Huang said that limiting sales of some of his chips in China had merely made alternatives more popular.Read More: Intel’s $20 Billion Ohio Chip Hub Will Be World’s LargestOverall, the executives argued that while Chinese customers have been forced to buy more chips to do the work of banned products, that hasn’t significantly slowed them down. The availability and quality of software they’re using more than compensates for any hardware restrictions, they argued.Gelsinger, who also spoke at the Aspen Security Forum, mentioned the meetings in Washington during his appearance on Wednesday.“We did communicate a very important message on China,” he said. “Right now, China represents 25% to 30% of semiconductor exports. If I have 20% or 30% less market, I need to build less factories.”It’s in the interest of the US to allow its chip companies access to the Chinese market in general because revenue from that country helps fuel research and development, he argued. And that’s needed to keep the nation’s lead in new technology such as quantum computing.Qualcomm gets more than 60% of its revenue from the China region, where it supplies components to smartphone makers such as Xiaomi Corp. Gelsinger, who visited Beijing earlier this month to show off his company’s latest AI chips, counts the nation as Intel’s biggest sales region — with China providing about a quarter of its revenue. For Nvidia, China provides about a fifth of sales.So far, chip equipment makers such as Applied Materials Inc. have taken the biggest hits to revenue, being forced to knock billions of dollars off their projections. But the restrictions, which companies fear will be extended to other classes of chips, are also affecting some device makers.Most Read from Bloomberg BusinessweekInfluencers Built Up This Wellness Startup—Until They Started Getting SickThe Stainless-Steel Boom Is Tearing a South African Mining Region ApartNo Testing, No Inspections: Contaminated Eyedrops Blinded and Killed AmericansWeightWatchers Is Gambling Everything on Obesity DrugsThis Supposed Mafia Manifesto Doesn’t Stand Up to a Google Search©2023 Bloomberg L.P.]"

Driving this momentum has been a combination of favorable developments on the macro front, primarily growing clarity surrounding the Fed’s tightening cycle, optimism about the impact of artificial intelligence (AI) that some view warily as reminders of the late 1990s, and an emerging sense that the worst of Tech spending headwinds is either behind us or close to that stage.With many Tech companies on deck to report June-quarter results this week, the market will be looking for more color on business spending trends, particularly on the cloud side. A big part of Tech’s improved earnings outlook over the last few months has been a function of more effective cost controls that have helped stabilize margins.Improved clarity on top-line trends will help solidify the nascent favorable revisions trend and undergird the group’s impressive stock market momentum.Surrounding it all is the AI debate, where we have already seen direct revenue impact from the likes of Nvidia NVDA and some ideas from Microsoft MSFT. Still, the innovation’s productivity-enhancing potential appears to be some ways off in the future.That said, the stock market is essentially a discounting system of the future. To the extent that we see viable business models in the days ahead that make use of AI, the so-called large language models beyond Nvidia selling more capable chips, and Microsoft starting to charge for new AI-driven bells and whistles in its Office productivity suite, the stock market excitement would be totally justified.These topics will be front and center in this week’s earnings reports from three of the ‘Big 7 Tech players’. Alphabet GOOGL and Microsoft MSFT report after the market’s close on Tuesday (7/25), and Instagram parent Meta Platforms META reports after the close on Wednesday (7/26). Of the remaining four members of this ‘club,’ Tesla has reported already, and Amazon, Apple, and Nvidia are not reporting this week.Story continuesThe chart below shows the year-to-date stock market performance of the Zacks Technology sector (third from the bottom; up +38.7%), the S&amp;P 500 index (bottom line; up +18.9%), Alphabet (second from the bottom; up +36.3%), Microsoft (second from the top; up +44.6%), and Meta (top line; up +147.2%).Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchDigital advertising has historically been seen as core to Alphabet and Meta, but Amazon has steadily become a major player in the space as well. Ad spending likely remained stable in Q2, but it will be interesting to see how these management teams see trends for the current and coming periods, given the macroeconomic uncertainties. This will also be at play in the Snap SNAP report, which also reports Q2 results on Tuesday (7/25) this week.All of these companies are big players in the artificial intelligence (AI) space, with the Microsoft vs. Alphabet rivalry particularly intense. With the initial excitement around ChatGPT and other AI applications now behind us, the questions now center around how these AI capabilities will be monetized through new and existing business models. It is reasonable to expect each of these management teams to spend considerable time on their Q2 earnings calls on their AI plan.Take a look at the chart below that shows current consensus expectations for the ‘Big 7 Tech Players’ as a whole for the current and coming periods in the context of what they achieved in the preceding period.As you can see, the group is expected to have +14.7% higher earnings in 2023 Q2 on +8% higher revenues. This would follow the -2.5% drop in earnings on +4.9% higher revenues in 2023 Q1.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchPlease note that the +14.7% earnings growth and +8% revenue growth in Q2 today is up from +4% earnings growth and +4.3% revenue growth expected for the group three months back. As with Q2, estimates for full-year 2023 have notably increased as well.The chart below that shows the group’s earnings and revenue growth on an annual basis.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchThe group’s phenomenal boost in 2021 partly reflected pulled forward demand from future periods that was in the process of getting adjusted last year and this year. As you can see above, the expectation is for the group to resume ‘regular/normal’ growth next year, but a lot of that is contingent on how the macroeconomic picture unfolds.Beyond these mega-cap players, total Q2 earnings for the Technology sector as a whole are expected to be down -4.4% from the same period last year on -0.1% lower revenues.The chart below shows the sector’s Q2 earnings and revenue growth expectations in the context of where growth has been in recent quarters and what is expected in the coming four periods.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchThis big-picture view of the ‘Big 7 players’ and the sector as a whole shows that the worst of the growth challenge is shifting into the rearview mirror. You can see this clearly in the chart below.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchPlease note that the -1.9% earnings decline expected for the sector is less than half of the -4.8% decline expected three months back.The Earnings Big PictureRegular readers of our earnings commentary know that we have consistently been flagging a favorable turn in the revisions trend since the start of 2023 Q2, with earnings estimates stabilizing in the aggregate after consistently coming down for almost a year and actually starting to go up for some key sectors.This combination of favorable macroeconomic developments and optimism about the transformational power of artificial intelligence (AI) appears to be driving market optimism.To get a sense of what is currently expected, take a look at the chart below that shows current earnings and revenue growth expectations for the S&amp;P 500 index for 2023 Q2, the following three quarters, and actual results for the preceding four quarters.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchAs you can see in this chart, Q2 is on track to be the third quarter in a row of earnings declines and the first quarter of declining revenues. We should point out here that a big part of the earnings and revenue weakness is due to the Energy sector. Excluding the Energy sector drag, Q2 earnings would be down -2.9% on +3.1% higher revenues.The chart below shows the year-over-year change in net income margins for the S&amp;P 500 index.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchAs you can see above, 2023 Q2 will be the 6th consecutive quarter of declining margins for the S&amp;P 500 index.Margins in Q2 are expected to be below the year-earlier level for 12 of the 16 Zacks sectors, with the biggest margin pressure expected to be in the Basic Materials, Construction, Energy, Medical, Conglomerates, Autos, Aerospace, and Tech sectors.On the positive side, the Finance sector is the only one expected to experience significant margin gains, with the Consumer Discretionary and Transportation sectors as distant second and third. Sectors expected to be essentially flat regarding margins relative to 2022 Q2 are Retail, Utilities, and Industrial Products.The chart below shows the earnings and revenue growth picture on an annual basis.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchAs noted earlier, the estimate revisions trend has notably stabilized since the start of Q2. In the aggregate, S&amp;P 500 earnings estimates for 2023 have declined -1.2% since the beginning of April but only -0.3% on an ex-Energy basis. Importantly, estimates for sectors like Tech, Construction, Autos, and Transportation have increased in that timeframe.Q2 Earnings ScorecardWe get into the heart of the Q2 earnings season, with more than 650 companies on deck to report results, including 165 S&amp;P 500 members or one-third of the index’s total membership. With results from 89 index members already out through Friday, July 21st, we will have crossed the halfway mark in the Q2 reporting cycle by the end of this week.Total Q2 earnings for the 89 S&amp;P 500 members are up +3.4% from the same period last year on +8.5% higher revenues, with 78.7% beating EPS estimates and 60.7% beating revenue estimates.The comparison charts put the Q2 results from these 89 index members with what we had seen from the same group of companies in other recent periods.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchThe comparison charts below put the Q2 earnings and revenue growth rates for these 89 index members in a historical context.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchFor a detailed look at the overall earnings picture, including expectations for the coming periods, please check out our weekly Earnings Trends report &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Q2 Earnings Season Gets Off to a Positive Start   Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Nvidia shares continue to reach all-time highs in 2023, rising 200% year-to-date. Meta is another tech stock investing in artificial intelligence. Rhind specifies that AI is ""real"" and that it's proving to not just be ""a short-term hype where people got in and in six months time have forgotten all about it.""U.S. home sales are stalling as housing prices climb higher, which is why Rhind wants to shy away from home improvement retailer Home Depot. New homes may be selling, but homeowners locked into mortgages are not spending as much on home repair as they were during the ""big reshuffle"" from pandemic spending trends. Lastly, Rhind finds there to be geopolitical and environmental concerns tied to how much higher energy company Exxon Mobil may climb. He compares it to the post-pandemic nature of tech stocks, which have a lot more room to decline as COVID-era market conditions begin to settle down.Video Transcript- Will Rhind, founder and CEO of GraniteShares joins us now. So Will, let's start with AI. I think we may know the play there. But, I guess, you know, not only what names you like, but how you guys have thought about that theme and how quickly it really came on for investors.WILL RHIND: Yeah. No, absolutely. I mean, by far and away the trade of the year in terms of AI, I think the difference being that people really, I think, believe that this is something that is real this time as opposed to a short-term fad.So Nvidia has been front and center of every investor's mind. The stock performance has been unbelievable year to date. And we've been able to participate in that, if you will, with our Nvidia ETFs. We have a leveraged single stock play on Nvidia for people to get exposure. And that's been a good way to play it.Story continues- So how much-- I guess, two parts, how much inflows have you seen or what's the inflows been like to that product specifically? But then also, how do you guys think about where that fits into a portfolio? And, like, how someone might want to use that name if they see that option on the menu?WILL RHIND: Yeah. So we're, I guess, nearly $200 million in terms of inflows year to date in Nvidia, which is the Nvidia stock. And I think there's a number of different ways that people use it. I mean, clearly one of the problems with AI is it's this kind of amorphous concept, where a lot of people say, hey I want to play AI, but how do I do it?And so when they go to the broad diversified ETF market, they might find ETFs even ETFs that labeled AI, the challenges inside it, you get a bunch of stocks that really sometimes can have very little to do with it. So that's where something like a very concentrated exposure like Nvidia itself or the leveraged single stock version has been so popular.SEANA SMITH: Well, how are you looking at the valuation aspect of Nvidia? The other stock that you like within this space that has been largely tied to the AI rally is Meta. There's been some concern out there just about the lofty valuations that we are seeing from companies like that. Why is that not giving you pause?WILL RHIND: I think that, as I sort of said at the beginning, I think the difference for me is I think AI is real. It's not just a short-term hype where people got in and, you know, six months time, would have forgotten all about it.SEANA SMITH: Do you think we will though, see a bit of a pullback here, at least in the short-term?WILL RHIND: It's possible. I think that if you look at every analyst on the Street, they're kind of overwhelmingly bullish on Nvidia, with some people pricing Nvidia $100 plus higher than where the stock trades today. There's no doubt that there's been multiple expansion from a lot of these big companies from where we were last year in the first half of this year. And that will have to be backed up by fundamentals in the next six months as we get into towards the end of the year.But I think a company like that is just so well positioned. And in a market where everyone's out there digging for gold, a company like Nvidia is providing the shovels.- I guess when you raise your guidance by 50%, you get away with some things when it comes to valuation.Let's talk about a couple of names you're a little more cautious on. And one that stands out to me is Home Depot, particularly since we see demand for new homes or home builders are very excited about their prospects, but when it comes to existing homes, maybe DIY, what kind of in your view is some of the caution around that story?WILL RHIND: I think it's kind of what you just said, Myles, is that, you know, we've got a real issue with the housing market at the moment. And the housing market is as largely as ground to a halt, not sale of new homes because new homes are new supply coming onto the market. Home builders that have supply are selling homes. But for people that locked in mortgage rates that were a lot lower than where the market is trading today, those people aren't moving.And so the big reshuffle and the fever that we saw in Home Depot and other stocks during the pandemic has definitely come down. And I think the trouble is that right now we've got to see the housing market start to loosen up. And I just don't see that happening anytime soon, at least until we reverse course on rates.SEANA SMITH: Well, the other pick that you're advising investors to stay away from is Exxon Oil, still below 80 bucks a barrel. You don't see-- we've heard from a couple of strategists that they do think energy is a great buy right now heading into the second half of the year. That we will see that global demand picture improve a bit. Why are you taking the other side of that bet?WILL RHIND: Because I think people have to remember that before the last couple of years, in other words, the bottom of the pandemic, Exxon, another big-- a number of big oil companies didn't go anywhere for 10 years. The reason for that was that, you know, oil effectively or oil companies, there was increasing pressure from environmental concerns and others about the future of these companies and obviously carbonization more broadly.You know, the stock price has done incredibly well on the back of what we saw in the pandemic, brought forward, you know, a huge amount of growth. But the question really is just like the tech stocks before the pandemic, the question is, you know, what came up or what went up massively over the last couple of years? I think now has got room to come down.- And it seems like in an environment where you can write a 10-year secular thesis for a stock again, which you couldn't do for a little while. You know, oil doesn't exactly get people super fired up about the long term prospects.WILL RHIND: It's not a growth story at the end of the day. And it doesn't have to be to make it attractive. I think Exxon will go back to what it was, which is a company that has fantastic cash flows and can pay a good dividend. But it's not going to be the stock that doubles or triples like it did over the last few years.- And, well, quickly before we let you go, I want to ask about gold generally and just kind of thinking about portfolio positioning right now. And, you know, I think a lot of people who maybe weren't even super overweight tech now because of the rally all of a sudden have a ton of tech in their portfolio, might be thinking, I would like to get rid of some of this and buy something else. How are you thinking about gold at this point?WILL RHIND: Well, I think gold is in a good position at the moment. And the key word is the dollar, that we're kind of at the metaphorical top of the mountain, if you will, with interest rates as opposed to the bottom or halfway up.And so gold prices, you know, hanging in here quite nicely because we've seen the dollar weaken, you know, from the peak last year. And so just like with a lot of these top tech companies, a tailwind that's going to come into the market is those that have big international earnings that got hampered last year because of the dollar strength will now see that as a tailwind with the weaker dollar. And it's the same for me with the gold market.- Great. Well, Will Rhind, founder, CEO at GraniteShares. Thanks so much for stopping by. Have a great weekend.WILL RHIND: Thank you.]"

The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 8.21 points, or 0.02%, to 35,233.39.The Nasdaq has rallied about 34% this year, lifted by optimism over artificial intelligence, a relatively resilient U.S. economy and expectations that the Federal Reserve's aggressive rate hike cycle will end soon.While the Fed is widely expected to raise interest rates by 25 basis points at its July 25-26 meeting, investors have mixed views on the central bank's longer-term monetary policy.American Express fell after the credit card giant missed quarterly revenue estimates and affirmed its full-year profit forecast.SLB declined after the top oilfield services firm missed quarterly revenue expectations due to moderating drilling activity in North America.

BAX is scheduled to release second-quarter 2023 results on Jul 27, before the opening bell. In the last reported quarter, the company’s earnings beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 22.92%. BAX’s earnings missed estimates in two of the trailing four quarters, met once and beat in the other, delivering an average surprise of 3.85%.Q2 EstimatesCurrently, the consensus estimate for second-quarter revenues is pegged at $3.79 billion, indicating an improvement of 1.3% from the prior-year quarter’s figure. The same for earnings is pinned at 59 cents per share, implying a 32.2% year-over-year decline.Factors to NoteFor the second quarter, Baxter expects sales to grow 1-2% on a reported basis and 2-3% at constant currency basis. Adjusted earnings per share is expected between 59 cents and 61 cents. Earnings outlook for the quarter reflects inflationary pressure, rising interest expense and higher tax rate.Robust demand for Baxter’s broad multi-chamber product offering is likely to have continued in the second quarter, driving sales of its Clinical Nutrition segment. Moreover, a continued rise in surgical volume and elective surgical procedures is expected to have fueled strong growth in Advanced Surgery’s sales.Our estimate for Clinical Nutrition and Advanced Surgery’s second-quarter 2023 sales is pegged at $231.2 million and $260.9 million, respectively.Renal Care segment sales reflected recovering trend during the first quarter, following a decline in the previous two quarters. However, a potential decline in China due to the impact of various government-based procurement initiatives might have continued to hurt Renal sales during the soon-to-be-reported quarter.Meanwhile, strong growth in Baxter’s PD business and IV therapy portfolio is likely to have been more than offset by lower in-center HD sales, lower infusion system sales and unfavorable currency movement. Our estimate for the segment’s sales is pegged at $966.3 million.Story continuesThe company has multiple collaborations to help manufacture COVID-19 vaccines. However, sales growth of the BioPharma Solutions segment is likely to have been hurt by challenging year-over-year comparisons, resulting from prior-year COVID-related sales.Sales at Acute Therapies segment are also expected to have experienced a similar impact in the soon-to-be-reported quarter. Our estimate for BioPharma Solutions and Acute Therapies’ sales is pegged at $165.7 million and $155 million, respectively.Sales of the Pharmaceutical segment are likely to have been boosted by strong growth in U.S. injectables portfolio, partially offset by lower sales for injectables in the international market. Our estimate for the segment’s sales is pinned at $525 million.In the first quarter of 2023, all of Baxter’s global regions performed weakly due to unfavorable currency movements. In the Americas, the company reported revenues of $1.6 billion, down 1% from the prior-year quarter’s level.In EMEA, revenues totaled $714 million, up 2% from the year-ago quarter’s figure. In APAC, revenues of $602 million were down 4% year over year. The trend is likely to have continued in the to-be-reported quarter.Meanwhile, three new product categories that were added with the Hillrom buyout in December 2021 generated $731 million in the first quarter. These products are likely to have brought additional sales during the second quarter.Continued demand for the physical assessment and cardiology portfolios within the Front Line Care business might have driven Hillrom’s second-quarter sales. Meanwhile, inflationary pressure as well as freight and supply-chain constraints are likely to have increased cost of goods, hurting gross margin. However, these headwinds are likely to be softer than those in the last reported quarter.Baxter has proposed the spin-off of its Kidney Care company, including Renal Care and Acute Therapies businesses, earlier this year. It expects to complete the spin-off by July 2024 or earlier. The company is also pursuing strategic alternatives for its BioPharma Solutions business. Investors may ask questions related to the proposed spin-off during the company’s second-quarter earnings call. BAX may provide an update related to its progress with strategic alternatives for BioPharma Solutions business.In June, Baxter launched Progressa+ bed for intensive care units in the United States. This bed has been designed to help nurses care for patients and support patient recovery. The company may provide an update on the launch progress on its second-quarter earnings call.Baxter International Inc. Price and ConsensusBaxter International Inc.

The company witnessed continued growth in its da Vinci procedure volume. Although COVID-19 cases adversely impacted its procedure volume in China during the quarter, the country plans to add 559 robotic systems in the coming years. Intuitive Surgical will provide some of these systems, mostly between 2024 and 2027. This will drive top-line growth significantly.Although gross margin contracted, operating margins improved during the second quarter (as anticipated). The declining trend in operating expenses is likely to continue for the rest of 2023.Despite better-than-expected results, shares of Intuitive Surgical declined more than 5% during after-hours trading on Jul 20, possibly reflecting a broader market trend.

Yahoo Finance Live's Myles Udland and Seana Smith review the environment for financial stocks and how it may not be all ""doom and gloom"" for regional banks based on earnings performances.Video TranscriptSEANA SMITH: And there were certainly a lot of, I guess, worry going into this week at exactly what the banks were going to tell us. And when you compare maybe the results from JP Morgan to the results of Goldman Sachs, obviously, a very different picture, not exactly surprising, something that we did expect going into this earnings season.But when you take into account some of the other banks that we also heard from because regionals and almost seemed like investor sentiment there was it's OK. It's better than expected. Deposit levels look like they have stabilized just a bit. And the market at least right now looking at that as a win.MYLES UDLAND: Yeah. And I know we can take a look at a couple of different regionals. Western Alliance was one of those names that all of a sudden everybody knew that stock. I think we have Western, Zions Bancorp, and KeyBank on this chart. And you look all these names over the last month, up at least 15%. Western Alliance up quite a bit more than that. All of these names higher on the week by more than, I think it's more than 10%. Can't quite make that out there.But we have seen these names move higher on their earnings. And it is funny looking at both the reaction in these stocks and the way that these management teams talked on the call to think that it was only, what, 3 and 1/2 months ago that we were, like, maybe there's another banking crisis. Who could really-- how many more banks will fail.And Western Alliance was certainly one of those names that there was a lot of concern about in the market, the viability of the bank at all. And now you kind of get on the other side of that. I mean, you remember folks coming on the show almost every day saying, there might be a big opportunity here. And, well, here's the opportunity, I guess. You had to really have to hold your nose. But, you know, this is now turning into the kind of story that I think when you x out the unique issues that SVB and others, you can talk yourself into.Story continuesSEANA SMITH: Yeah. No glaring credit issues. It seems like at least that is obviously good news here or enough, I should say, obviously. It's good news. But enough here for investors at least at this point. But they're not out of the woods yet when it comes to the fact that they are being forced to pay more in order to keep those deposits there at a massive disadvantage when you compare many of those regional banks to the current position of those larger banks. And the fact that environment might not change anytime.MYLES UDLAND: Looking at that year to date chart on those names, I think it is fair to say that the old-- because the old story with regional banks is basically, well, if rates go up, it's good because these are more deposit-heavy banks, therefore, they can make more money on the spread, the net interest income, right? And with there not being competition for deposits, the idea is that, well, you can just turn the higher, you know, rate that you can get on a Treasury or whatever and move that right to your bottom line.So I think to some extent, investors may be sleepwalked into this year with this story specifically. And yes, now there is quite a bit of work to do to rightsize that, let's say. But ultimately, you are probably not going to see-- it seems at this point. Look, famous last words, don't clip this. Probably not going to see like 10 more banks fail before the end of this year.SEANA SMITH: I hope you're right.MYLES UDLAND: It feels like that, right?SEANA SMITH: That seems like a pretty safe.MYLES UDLAND: It feels like there will probably be fewer than 10 banks in the US fail for the balance of 2023. That's my big prediction.SEANA SMITH: I'm going to side with you on that one. I think it's fair.]"

FFIV is scheduled to report third-quarter fiscal 2023 results on Jul 24. The application security solution provider’s third-quarter performance is likely to have benefited from the recovery in the Systems product category.Backlog Clearance to Boost Systems’ RevenuesIndustry-wide supply-chain constraints for components in 2022 had severely hurt F5’s Systems segment’s overall performance. Despite strong demand, the company wasn’t able to supply due to component shortages and failed to meet the demand for its Systems products.As a result, its Systems product category registered a revenue decline in back-to-back four quarters from the second quarter of fiscal 2022 to the first quarter of fiscal 2023. This also resulted in a huge order backlog for F5’s Systems products.However, an improvement in the supply chain has helped the company clear its backlog from the second quarter of fiscal 2023 onward. Due to the massive backlog clearance, the company reported whopping 43% year-over-year growth in Systems’ revenues in the last reported quarter.The trend is likely to have continued in the third quarter.

The decrease reflects flat organic growth and a $2 million negative impact from changes in FX rates.Second quarter 2023 GAAP operating expenses increased $62 million, or 13%, versus the prior year period. The increase primarily reflects higher merger and strategic initiatives expense related to the Adenza acquisition, higher restructuring expenses associated with the launch of our divisional alignment program in the fourth quarter of 2022, and higher employee compensation costs, partially offset by lower general and administrative expense.Second quarter 2023 non-GAAP operating expenses increased $28 million, or 7% versus the prior year period. The increase primarily reflects increased expenses associated with the continued investment in our people and our businesses to drive long term growth, partially offset by changes in FX rates.The company did not repurchase any of its common stock during the second quarter of 2023. As of June 30, 2023, there was $491 million remaining under the board authorized share repurchase program.2023 EXPENSE AND TAX GUIDANCE UPDATE5The company is updating its 2023 non-GAAP operating expense guidance to a range of $1,785 million to $1,815 million. Nasdaq expects its 2023 non-GAAP tax rate to be in the range of 24% to 26%.STRATEGIC AND BUSINESS UPDATESNasdaq announced the acquisition of Adenza. In June, Nasdaq announced it entered into a definitive agreement to acquire Adenza for $10.5 billion in cash and stock. The transaction supercharges Nasdaq’s ability to become a leading provider of capital markets risk and regulatory technology. Adenza operates two leading software platforms: Calypso’s front-to-back suite of capital markets risk management, treasury, cash, collateral management, and post-trade solutions; and AxiomSL’s regulatory reporting, global shareholder disclosure, capital and liquidity management, transaction and ESG reporting solutions. Adenza expands Nasdaq’s serviceable addressable market by approximately 40% by adding a solidly expanding market opportunity with powerful secular growth drivers across regulatory and market reforms, digitization and modernization, and vendor simplification as financial institutions move from in-house to trusted-partner solutions. Nasdaq secured approximately $5 billion in financing for the proposed acquisition of Adenza through an oversubscribed debt offering. Nasdaq secured financing through a successful bond issuance of $4.25 billion in US dollar denominated debt across 2, 5, 10, 30 and 40 year terms and a 750 million Euro denominated 8-year bond with an attractive weighted average interest rate of just under 5.5%.In Marketplace Technology, two leading Latin American exchanges, DCV and B3, adopted Nasdaq’s post-trade technology. Chile’s central securities depository, Depósito Central de Valores (DCV), has launched Nasdaq Central Security Depository platform for issuing and settling digital securities. Separately, Nasdaq signed a 10-plus year partnership with Brazil’s largest stock exchange, Brasil, Bolsa, Balcão (B3), to build a next generation clearing solution under which B3 will migrate to Nasdaq’s real-time clearing platform and work as a product roadmap development partner.Nasdaq announced its plan to sell its European energy trading and clearing business. As part of its focus on prioritizing high value opportunities, Nasdaq entered into an agreement to sell its European energy trading and clearing business, subject to regulatory approval, but remains committed to being a leading European market operator. Verafin accelerated its large customer momentum signing four significant new bank clients in the second quarter. As we previously announced, Verafin signed two Tier 1 bank customers and signed two additional Tier 2 banks to its anti-fraud solutions. Verafin’s continuing growth with large financial institutions reflects the differentiated value of its SaaS enabled anti-money laundering and fraud prevention solutions data consortium.Nasdaq executed second-highest ever one-day Closing Cross volume in June. During the annual Russell U.S. indexes reconstitution, which occurred in late June, Nasdaq successfully executed approximately 2.6 billion shares representing $62 billion dollars in market value in 0.86 seconds across Nasdaq-listed securities. This represented the second highest volume of shares crossed since implementing the Closing Cross in 2004, demonstrating Nasdaq’s robust and resilient market infrastructure.Nasdaq maintained listings leadership in the U.S. The Nasdaq Stock Market led U.S. exchanges for operating company IPOs with a 77% total win rate during the first half of 2023. The Nasdaq Stock Market featured two of the three largest U.S. operating company IPOs by capital raised, with a strong pipeline of companies on file and committed to list with Nasdaq.____________1 Represents revenues less transaction-based expenses. 2 Constitutes revenues from our Capital Access Platforms and Anti-Financial Crime segments and Marketplace Technology business within Market Platforms.3 Refer to our reconciliations of U.S. GAAP to non-GAAP net income, diluted earnings per share, operating income, operating expenses and organic impacts included in the attached schedules.4 Annualized Recurring Revenue (ARR) for a given period is the annualized revenue derived from subscription contracts with a defined contract value. This excludes contracts that are not recurring, are one-time in nature or where the contract value fluctuates based on defined metrics. ARR is currently one of our key performance metrics to assess the health and trajectory of our recurring business. ARR does not have any standardized definition and is therefore unlikely to be comparable to similarly titled measures presented by other companies. ARR should be viewed independently of revenue and deferred revenue and is not intended to be combined with or to replace either of those items. ARR is not a forecast and the active contracts at the end of a reporting period used in calculating ARR may or may not be extended or renewed by our customers.5 U.S. GAAP operating expense and tax rate guidance are not provided due to the inherent difficulty in quantifying certain amounts due to a variety of factors including the unpredictability in the movement in foreign currency rates, as well as future charges or reversals outside of the normal course of business.ABOUT NASDAQNasdaq (Nasdaq: NDAQ) is a global technology company serving corporate clients, investment managers, banks, brokers, and exchange operators as they navigate and interact with the global capital markets and the broader financial system.

Management uses this non-GAAP information internally, along with U.S. GAAP information, in evaluating our performance and in making financial and operational decisions. We believe our presentation of these measures provides investors with greater transparency and supplemental data relating to our financial condition and results of operations. In addition, we believe the presentation of these measures is useful to investors for period-to-period comparisons of results as the items described below in the reconciliation tables do not reflect ongoing operating performance.These measures are not in accordance with, or an alternative to, U.S. GAAP, and may be different from non-GAAP measures used by other companies. In addition, other companies, including companies in our industry, may calculate such measures differently, which reduces their usefulness as a comparative measure. Investors should not rely on any single financial measure when evaluating our business. This information should be considered as supplemental in nature and is not meant as a substitute for our operating results in accordance with U.S. GAAP. We recommend investors review the U.S. GAAP financial measures included in this earnings release. When viewed in conjunction with our U.S. GAAP results and the accompanying reconciliations, we believe these non-GAAP measures provide greater transparency and a more complete understanding of factors affecting our business than U.S. GAAP measures alone.We understand that analysts and investors regularly rely on non-GAAP financial measures, such as those noted above, to assess operating performance. We use these measures because they highlight trends more clearly in our business that may not otherwise be apparent when relying solely on U.S. GAAP financial measures, since these measures eliminate from our results specific financial items that have less bearing on our ongoing operating performance.Organic revenue and expense growth, organic change and organic impact are non-GAAP measures that reflect adjustments for: (i) the impact of period-over-period changes in foreign currency exchange rates, and (ii) the revenues, expenses and operating income associated with acquisitions and divestitures for the twelve month period following the date of the acquisition or divestiture. Reconciliations of these measures are described within the body of this release.Foreign exchange impact: In countries with currencies other than the U.S. dollar, revenues and expenses are translated using monthly average exchange rates. Certain discussions in this release isolate the impact of year-over-year foreign currency fluctuations to better measure the comparability of operating results between periods. Operating results excluding the impact of foreign currency fluctuations are calculated by translating the current period’s results by the prior period’s exchange rates.Divisional alignment program: In October 2022, following our September announcement to realign our segments and leadership, we initiated a divisional alignment program with a focus on realizing the full potential of this structure. In connection with the program, we expect to incur pre-tax charges principally related to employee-related costs, consulting, asset impairments and contract terminations over a two-year period. We expect to achieve benefits in the form of both increased customer engagement and operating efficiencies. Costs related to the divisional alignment program will be recorded as “restructuring” in our consolidated statements of income. We will exclude charges associated with this program for purposes of calculating non-GAAP measures as they are not reflective of ongoing operating performance or comparisons in Nasdaq's performance between periods.CAUTIONARY NOTE REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTSInformation set forth in this communication contains forward-looking statements that involve a number of risks and uncertainties. Nasdaq cautions readers that any forward-looking information is not a guarantee of future performance and that actual results could differ materially from those contained in the forward-looking information.

Additionally, with respect to Nasdaq’s proposed acquisition of Adenza, these risks and uncertainties include Nasdaq’s ability to secure regulatory approvals on the terms expected, in a timely manner or at all, Nasdaq’s ability to successfully integrate Adenza’s operations, Nasdaq’s ability to implement its plans, forecasts and other expectations with respect to Adenza’s business after the completion of the transaction and realize expected synergies, the ability to realize the anticipated benefits of the proposed transaction, including the possibility that the expected benefits from the proposed transaction will not be realized or will not be realized within the expected time period, the impact of Adenza’s business model on Nasdaq’s ability to forecast revenue results, disruption from the transaction making it more difficult to maintain business and operational relationships, risks related to diverting management’s attention from Nasdaq’s ongoing business operations, the negative effects of the announcement or the consummation of the proposed transaction on the market price of Nasdaq’s common stock or on Nasdaq’s operating results, significant transaction costs, unknown liabilities, the risk of litigation or regulatory actions related to the proposed transaction, future levels of Nasdaq’s indebtedness, including additional indebtedness that will be incurred in connection with the proposed transaction, and the effect of the announcement or pendency of the transaction on Adenza’s business relationships, operating results, and business generally. Further information on these and other factors are detailed in Nasdaq’s filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, including its annual reports on Form 10-K and quarterly reports on Form 10-Q which are available on Nasdaq’s investor relations website at http://ir.nasdaq.com and the SEC’s website at www.sec.gov.

JNPR is scheduled to report its second-quarter 2023 results on Jul 27, after market close. The company delivered an earnings surprise of 5.24%, on average, in the trailing four quarters. In the last reported quarter, it delivered an earnings surprise of 11.63%.The leading provider of networking solutions and communication devices is expected to report year-over-year top-line growth, driven by a strong emphasis on innovation, portfolio expansion and the growing demand for its AI-powered network technologies.Factors at PlayIn the second quarter, Juniper inked an agreement with citizenM for an undisclosed amount to enhance the latter's hotel experience worldwide, by bolstering its network capabilities. By integrating guest-centric technologies that provide personalized experiences for guests, Juniper’s solutions will likely improve citizenM’s hotel connectivity at low operational costs.During the quarter, Juniper unveiled a cloud-based Access Assurance Service, aimed at providing comprehensive support to network administrators.

253,371bdf7b-61e3-3336-ae40-5dc8379a1262,XRAY,2023-07-22,"AmerisourceBergen Corporation (ABC) Soars to 52-Week High, Time to Cash Out?",Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/amerisourcebergen-corporation-abc-soars-52-131503620.html,1689945303,STORY,['XRAY'],"[Have you been paying attention to shares of AmerisourceBergen (ABC)? Shares have been on the move with the stock up 3% over the past month. The stock hit a new 52-week high of $193.83 in the previous session. AmerisourceBergen has gained 16.7% since the start of the year compared to the -0.6% move for the Zacks Medical sector and the 16.4% return for the Zacks Medical - Dental Supplies industry.What's Driving the Outperformance?The stock has a great record of positive earnings surprises, as it hasn't missed our earnings consensus estimate in any of the last four quarters. In its last earnings report on May 2, 2023, AmerisourceBergen reported EPS of $3.5 versus consensus estimate of $3.29 while it beat the consensus revenue estimate by 4.36%.For the current fiscal year, AmerisourceBergen is expected to post earnings of $11.89 per share on $254.51 billion in revenues. This represents a 7.8% change in EPS on a 6.68% change in revenues. For the next fiscal year, the company is expected to earn $12.58 per share on $265.36 billion in revenues. This represents a year-over-year change of 5.78% and 4.26%, respectively.Valuation MetricsAmerisourceBergen may be at a 52-week high right now, but what might the future hold for the stock? A key aspect of this question is taking a look at valuation metrics in order to determine if the company has run ahead of itself.On this front, we can look at the Zacks Style Scores, as these give investors a variety of ways to comb through stocks (beyond looking at the Zacks Rank of a security). These styles are represented by grades running from A to F in the categories of Value, Growth, and Momentum, while there is a combined VGM Score as well. Investors should consider the style scores a valuable tool that can help you to pick the most appropriate Zacks Rank stocks based on their individual investment style.AmerisourceBergen has a Value Score of A. The stock's Growth and Momentum Scores are C and D, respectively, giving the company a VGM Score of A.Story continuesIn terms of its value breakdown, the stock currently trades at 16.3X current fiscal year EPS estimates, which is not in-line with the peer industry average of 21.6X. On a trailing cash flow basis, the stock currently trades at 12.9X versus its peer group's average of 14X. Additionally, the stock has a PEG ratio of 1.82. This isn't enough to put the company in the top echelon of all stocks we cover from a value perspective.Zacks RankWe also need to look at the Zacks Rank for the stock, as this supersedes any trend on the style score front. Fortunately, AmerisourceBergen currently has a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy) thanks to rising earnings estimates.Since we recommend that investors select stocks carrying Zacks Rank of 1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) and Style Scores of A or B, it looks as if AmerisourceBergen fits the bill. Thus, it seems as though AmerisourceBergen shares could still be poised for more gains ahead.How Does ABC Stack Up to the Competition?Shares of ABC have been soaring, and the company still appears to be a decent choice, but what about the rest of the industry? One industry peer that looks good is DENTSPLY SIRONA Inc. (XRAY). XRAY has a Zacks Rank of # 2 (Buy) and a Value Score of B, a Growth Score of C, and a Momentum Score of C.Earnings were strong last quarter. DENTSPLY SIRONA Inc. beat our consensus estimate by 18.18%, and for the current fiscal year, XRAY is expected to post earnings of $1.92 per share on revenue of $3.94 billion.Shares of DENTSPLY SIRONA Inc. have gained 4.4% over the past month, and currently trade at a forward P/E of 21.19X and a P/CF of 4.43X.The Medical - Dental Supplies industry is in the top 10% of all the industries we have in our universe, so it looks like there are some nice tailwinds for ABC and XRAY, even beyond their own solid fundamental situation.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

255,fe17c790-3a1e-3461-b6f5-ecfea5561752,CMCSA,2023-07-22,'Barbie' and 'Oppenheimer' both on track for a big opening weekend,Yahoo Finance Video,https://finance.yahoo.com/video/barbie-oppenheimer-both-track-big-203505744.html,1689971705,VIDEO,"['MAT', 'WBD', 'CMCSA']","[""Barbie"" and ""Oppenheimer"" have officially hit theaters, in double feature being dubbed ""Barbenheimer."" In previews, ""Barbie"" earned $23 million compared to ""Oppenheimer"" which earned $10.5 million. Box Office Guru Founder and Editor Gitesh Pandya tells Yahoo Finance Live ""this is a pop culture moment"" noting that with both films, the ""target audiences get exactly what they're looking for.""Video TranscriptSEANA SMITH: The ""Barbie"" movie is officially in theaters. And it's already blowing away the competition. Barbie raking in over $22 million at the domestic box office on Thursday previews beating ""Oppenheimer"" handily by more than $10 million. Our next guest has seen both of these movies. Joining us now, I want to bring in Gitesh Pandya. He's editor of boxofficeguru.com.Gitesh, great to have you here. So let's start with ""Barbie"" since that has been a lot of our focus here. That's expected to be the outperformer this weekend. There's been so much hype ahead of this weekend for the box office. Does Barbie live up to it?GITESH PANDYA: Well, I think it depends on what you're looking for. I think the target audience absolutely gets what they're looking for. This is a pop culture moment. You also have the whole Barbenheimer aspect of it which is separate.But this is the bigger of the two movies. It was always going to do better. $22.3 million from Thursday night pre-shows. That includes some of the Wednesday ""Barbie"" blowout shows. So I'm tracking this one to do well over $100 million this weekend, probably over $125 million for this opening weekend which would be the second biggest opening of the whole year.In fact, the Thursday pre-shows were the biggest of any movie this year to date. So the sales are huge. The word of mouth is very strong. It's at around 90% on Rotten Tomatoes audience score, so the people are liking it. And because of this whole double feature phenomenon, there's a lot of people who haven't seen it yet.Story continuesThey're planning to go Friday, Saturday, and Sunday. So there's a lot of business up ahead. I do wonder a little bit about the long-term picture here. You might have a lot of people go up front and then less business later on.- So let's talk then about ""Oppenheimer"" where we just had the graphic up, expectations for a slower opening weekend for that film. Do you think that one might have a longer tail? Or I guess as you think about these two movies that seem to be capturing popular attention in a way that we haven't seen too many films do over the last few years, what is it maybe that you think ""Oppenheimer"" is channeling in a different way with that kind of energy?GITESH PANDYA: Well, it's certainly a very Oscar-type of a film. And I've been tracking box office for over 30 years. I've never seen anything like this. Barbenheimer, two very different movies being put together in the conversation. People are talking about both at the same time.""Oppenheimer"" was always expected to be the smaller of the two films. Nothing new there. It's not a brand or an IP or anything. But this is a film where the director is the brand. And you're going to see a longer tail on this one, because of the word of mouth will be a little bit better moving forward.- So I guess in thinking then about we haven't seen anything like this before, I'm curious what you make of the way movies are marketed, but the way maybe they catch steam on, like, TikTok, right?Remember the-- when was the ""Gentleminions"" thing? Was that last year or two years ago? Like, all of a sudden you got teenagers dressing in suits going to see a ""Minions"" movie. No one's quite sure why.GITESH PANDYA: Yeah.- But as you know, CMOs everywhere were saying, how do we make this happen? So in your view, how are theaters or studios succeeding, failing, flailing in trying to get that kind of organic-- it's not organic, but seemingly organic--GITESH PANDYA: Yeah, it's semi-organic. It's critical. It's absolutely critical to the overall picture, because this is how people communicate. This is how people talk about things, how something gets hot. And Barbenheimer came up through the people.Two different studios never joined forces to market their two movies together when they opened on the same day. That never happens. So this is the people coming up and saying, listen, I'm interested in both movies. I'm going to make fan art, spread it around social media, and then sort of the whole chatter kind of came from there.And now, what it's good for is for the business, because it's expanding the marketplace. Two films opening this big, probably over $200 million in combined sales this weekend, you almost never see that. So the marketplace expands. It's a global phenomenon, because the overseas sales are very good on ""Barbie"" as well and also for ""Oppenheimer. "" So you've got more people going to the movies, and that's something that the studios really need right now.SEANA SMITH: When it comes to ""Barbie,"" this is obviously a nostalgia play when they're really marketing to people who used to play with Barbies 20, 30 years ago, Mattel has a whole slew of films that they are lined up here for some of their past hit toys, ""Hot Wheels,"" ""Thomas the Tank Engine,"" just to name a few of them. Are we going to see this type of success and this type of hype, do you think, for those installments or is this hype very Barbie-specific?GITESH PANDYA: Well, it's very Barbie-specific. I think that-- there's no guarantees for the future projects. You have to make a good film. Greta Gerwig has done some terrific films before. They hired her to make ""Barbie."" And she did a bang up job here.This is great with the critics, great with the audiences. People are loving it. I'm sure Warner Brothers will pull up with a dump truck full of money to make her do part two sometime after the strikes are all over. So it depends on how well you make it. I think some of those Mattel movies might flop if they're not made well. But if you look at different IP, people are turning everything into a movie, video games, toys. There was ""G.I. Joe."" There was ""Transformers."" There's ""Barbie."" So if you make it well, people will come.- And maybe it's just me floating into your area of expertise. But I think I just wonder when if ever we reach sequel saturation-- and perhaps it's just a misread that this is the way it's always been, and so we're just kind of making up something that doesn't exist. But in your view as someone who follows this week in and week out, has there actually been a market uptick in sequels and does It feel like audiences want something new rather than the 19th or 20th Marvel, however many of those movies there have been?GITESH PANDYA: Well, I think sequel fatigue is something about talk and not action. We talk about sequel fatigue. There's too many. Why do they keep making them? But if you look at the action, if you look at what people are buying tickets for every single year without fail, the sequels are the ones who are maybe 7 of the top 10, 8 of the top 10 every single year.So people keep coming out for the sequels, but there's room for original, if you call it original, or some new IP becoming a first of its kind movie. ""Super Mario Brothers"" which is not a sequel is the highest grossing movie of this year. ""Barbie"" is about to have one of the biggest openings of this year.So there are movies which are not sequels, but based on IP, they have a built-in audience which are becoming blockbusters. And I see more of that coming in. But you do have to have some room for the Oppenheimers of the world where you have directors that people really trust. And they'll go see anything he or she makes, and that's why you have this weekend with two different movies at the same time.SEANA SMITH: Gitesh, there has been though some chatter online people very upset with the strikes that are happening, the treatment of actors, writers here by the studios. And there's been some talk that maybe people are going to boycott the movie theaters over the coming weekends. How big of a concern is that within the industry?GITESH PANDYA: Not much of a concern. I think as far as the movie theaters go, it's really product-driven. People love ""Barbie."" They love ""Oppenheimer."" ""Mission Impossible"" still out there doing well. There's some new movies coming out in August and September and so on, horror films coming up this fall. So people will still go out for those films.The difference you'll see is that the actors on strike will not be promoting their films. And so that makes a big difference. And some studios will have to make the call, our stars will not be promoting this film, do we still release it as is or do we push it to later when we hope the strike is over if they need them to be on social media and promoting their films? Or is it a big brand that sells itself and then you can just kind of put it out there in the marketplace anyway? But I don't see consumers boycotting movie theaters all that much right now.]"

It also has an impeccable lineup of sports content, including Sunday Night Football, Premier League and Big 10, as well as streaming originals like Poker Face.NBCU witnessed encouraging results in the first quarter of 2023, wherein paid subscribers and engagement levels rose to roughly 20 hours per subscriber per month, fueling strong growth in advertising revenues.NBCU’s initiative to invest in more content has also encouraged it to raise the prices of Peacock. It recently announced a monthly hike in Peacock’s subscription fees, effective Aug 17, which is a first for the streaming platform since its debut in 2020.Story continuesPeacock Premium, which includes advertisements, will see a $1 increase to $5.99 per month, while Peacock Premium Plus, which offers primarily commercial-free content, will rise $2 to $11.99 per month. Despite the price increases, Peacock remains competitively priced compared with other streaming services.Peacock’s streaming counterparts, including Netflix NFLX, Disney and Paramount, have also raised prices in recent times.Disney raised Disney+ streaming platform’s ad-free price to $10.99 per month and ad included cost to $7.99 per month. Paramount Global raised Paramount+ and Paramount+ Essential streaming costs to $11.99 and $5.99 per month, respectively.Netflix hiked prices in early 2022 to $6.99 and $19.99 per month, for its ad-supported and ad-free subscription tiers, respectively. It scrapped the basic ad-free plan for new and rejoining members in Canada in the second quarter of 2023 and is doing the same for U.K. and U.S.-based subscribers.Within three years of its debut, Peacock was able to increase its content to 80,000 hours and is expected to reach 100,000 hours in total over the coming year. Further investments in content development are expected to help in expanding the subscriber base.Moreover, NBCU parent Comcast’s recent decision to add 20 free ad-supported television (“FAST”) channels to its X1 platform service is expected to further drive the user base. CMCSA first launched this channel to the Xfinity Stream app in April and then brought them to its latest OTT offering, Now TV.Now TV offers more than 40 live channels from A+E, AMC, Hallmark and Warner Bros. Discovery, in addition to the 20 integrated FAST channels, with a subscription to Peacock Premium at no additional cost.Zacks Rank &amp; Estimate DetailsComcast, which currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), is set to release its second-quarter 2023 results on Jul 27.

257,c5fafbea-919b-35a7-845b-e07082523947,CMCSA,2023-07-22,Analysts Estimate Charter Communications (CHTR) to Report a Decline in Earnings: What to Look Out for,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/analysts-estimate-charter-communications-chtr-140027548.html,1689948027,STORY,"['CHTR', 'CMCSA']","[Wall Street expects a year-over-year decline in earnings on higher revenues when Charter Communications (CHTR) reports results for the quarter ended June 2023. While this widely-known consensus outlook is important in gauging the company's earnings picture, a powerful factor that could impact its near-term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates.The earnings report, which is expected to be released on July 28, 2023, might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call, it's worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise.Zacks Consensus EstimateThis cable provider is expected to post quarterly earnings of $7.69 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of -12.6%.Revenues are expected to be $13.86 billion, up 1.9% from the year-ago quarter.Estimate Revisions TrendThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 0.72% lower over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change.Earnings WhisperEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. Our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) -- has this insight at its core.The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Story continuesThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Charter?For Charter, the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of -0.82%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #4.So, this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Charter will beat the consensus EPS estimate.Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that Charter would post earnings of $7.21 per share when it actually produced earnings of $6.65, delivering a surprise of -7.77%.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates just once.Bottom LineAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.Charter doesn't appear a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.Expected Results of an Industry PlayerComcast (CMCSA), another stock in the Zacks Cable Television industry, is expected to report earnings per share of $0.98 for the quarter ended June 2023. This estimate points to a year-over-year change of -3%. Revenues for the quarter are expected to be $30.25 billion, up 0.8% from the year-ago quarter.The consensus EPS estimate for Comcast has been revised 0.4% lower over the last 30 days to the current level. However, a higher Most Accurate Estimate has resulted in an Earnings ESP of 0.22%.This Earnings ESP, combined with its Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), suggests that Comcast will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate. The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters.Stay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

In the third quarter of 2022, the company acquired a 33% minority interest in Alexander Forbes Group Holdings Limited in South Africa. This investment is consistent with PRU’s strategic focus internationally on higher-growth emerging markets. The deal furthers the partnership’s specific objective to identify and make strategic investments in high-quality financial services companies in selected African geographies.Prudential Financial undertakes several strategic initiatives, which poise it well for long-term growth.

260,ad84fc43-3e23-32ca-a66a-45e415767277,DVN,2023-07-22,Is Devon Energy Corporation's (NYSE:DVN) Stock's Recent Performance Being Led By Its Attractive Financial Prospects?,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/devon-energy-corporations-nyse-dvn-120105660.html,1690027265,STORY,['DVN'],"[Most readers would already be aware that Devon Energy's (NYSE:DVN) stock increased significantly by 6.9% over the past week. Given the company's impressive performance, we decided to study its financial indicators more closely as a company's financial health over the long-term usually dictates market outcomes. In this article, we decided to focus on Devon Energy's  ROE.Return on equity or ROE is a key measure used to assess how efficiently a company's management is utilizing the company's capital. In short, ROE shows the profit each dollar generates with respect to its shareholder investments. View our latest analysis for Devon Energy How To Calculate Return On Equity?The formula for return on equity is:Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' EquitySo, based on the above formula, the ROE for Devon Energy is:54% = US$6.0b ÷ US$11b (Based on the trailing twelve months to March 2023).The 'return' refers to a company's earnings over the last year. That means that for every $1 worth of shareholders' equity, the company generated $0.54 in profit.What Is The Relationship Between ROE And Earnings Growth?Thus far, we have learned that ROE measures how efficiently a company is generating its profits. Depending on how much of these profits the company reinvests or ""retains"", and how effectively it does so, we are then able to assess a company’s earnings growth potential. Assuming all else is equal, companies that have both a higher return on equity and higher profit retention are usually the ones that have a higher growth rate when compared to companies that don't have the same features.Devon Energy's Earnings Growth And 54% ROEFirst thing first, we like that Devon Energy has an impressive ROE. Second, a comparison with the average ROE reported by the industry of 32% also doesn't go unnoticed by us. As a result, Devon Energy's exceptional 57% net income growth seen over the past five years, doesn't come as a surprise.Story continuesWe then compared Devon Energy's net income growth with the industry and we're pleased to see that the company's growth figure is higher when compared with the industry which has a growth rate of 22% in the same 5-year period.past-earnings-growthThe basis for attaching value to a company is, to a great extent, tied to its earnings growth. It’s important for an investor to know whether the market has priced in the company's expected earnings growth (or decline). Doing so will help them establish if the stock's future looks promising or ominous. If you're wondering about Devon Energy's's valuation, check out this gauge of its price-to-earnings ratio, as compared to its industry.Is Devon Energy Efficiently Re-investing Its Profits?Devon Energy has a three-year median payout ratio of 47% (where it is retaining 53% of its income) which is not too low or not too high. So it seems that Devon Energy is reinvesting efficiently in a way that it sees impressive growth in its earnings (discussed above) and pays a dividend that's well covered.Additionally, Devon Energy has paid dividends over a period of at least ten years which means that the company is pretty serious about sharing its profits with shareholders. Existing analyst estimates suggest that the company's future payout ratio is expected to drop to 30% over the next three years. Regardless, the future ROE for Devon Energy is predicted to decline to 20% despite the anticipated decrease in the payout ratio. We reckon that there could probably be other factors that could be driving the forseen decline in the company's ROE.SummaryOn the whole, we feel that Devon Energy's performance has been quite good. Specifically, we like that the company is reinvesting a huge chunk of its profits at a high rate of return. This of course has caused the company to see substantial growth in its earnings. With that said, on studying the latest analyst forecasts, we found that while the company has seen growth in its past earnings, analysts expect its future earnings to shrink.

261,faa40b0e-f297-3703-bd32-5b0cbdbdcecd,MU,2023-07-22,7 Blue-Chip Stocks That AI Is Loving in July,InvestorPlace,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/7-blue-chip-stocks-ai-192451687.html,1689449091,STORY,"['MSFT', 'GOOGL', 'NVDA', 'AMZN', 'MU', 'AI']","[I used Bard AI to help recommend blue-chip stocks for July. Right off the bat, it’s clear that Bard isn’t considering recent events in recommending the shares it has. Most of the rationale it offers in picking the shares centers on long-term factors.That’s fine, given that long-term investing produces better average returns. But it also suggests that short-term traders will have very little use for AI as it is currently. AI also has a penchant for AI. All of the shares below are intricately connected to the growth of artificial intelligence.Me: Hi Bard, I am writing an article titled “7 Blue-Chip Stocks That AI is Loving in July” Do you have any recommendations?InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsAI-Recommended Blue-Chip Stocks: Microsoft (MSFT)ChatGPT logo seen on the smartphone, Microsoft (MSFT) logo seen on the laptop. Microsoft CopilotSource: Ascannio / Shutterstock.comBard: “Microsoft is a leading provider of cloud computing and productivity software, and it is also investing heavily in AI. The company’s AI capabilities are used in a variety of products and services, including its Azure cloud platform, its Office 365 productivity suite, and its Bing search engine.”It’s difficult to disagree with Bard in regard to Microsoft’s (NASDAQ:MSFT) stock. The company is a leader in cloud and productivity. Azure and Microsoft Office are great technologies that have unlocked incredible value across the economy on a global scale. Further, the company has invested substantially in AI and in the integration of AI across its product suite.All of that leads to a reasonable conclusion that Microsoft remains a buy in July. However, it’s also reasonable to suggest that now isn’t the best time to buy MSFT stock. Based on the consensus target stock price, shares are currently oversold by $8.AI-fueled growth is the best reason to believe that Microsoft can continue to rise even though it is oversold. Intelligent cloud revenue increased by 16% during the first three months of 2023, reaching $22.1 billion. But Microsoft hasn’t given reason to believe that AI will immediately spike sales soon. Further, Microsoft may give up on the proposed Activision deal. This is why I believe it is among the best AI-recommended blue-chip stocks.Story continuesAmazon (AMZN)Closeup of the Amazon logo at Amazon campus in Palo Alto, California. The Palo Alto location hosts A9 Search, Amazon Web Services, and Amazon Game Studios teams. AMZN stockSource: Tada Images / Shutterstock.comBard: “Amazon is another major cloud computing provider, and it is also using AI to power its e-commerce business, its logistics network, and its advertising platform. The company’s AI capabilities are helping it to improve its efficiency, its customer service, and its product recommendations.”Unlike MSFT, Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) stock still has room to grow, according to Wall Street. Amazon hasn’t garnered a lot of attention for any particular AI integration or release. As Bard notes, the company is using AI to enhance its core businesses. It has been doing so for quite some time.In fact, Amazon has been receiving media attention for its AI integration for at least the last five years. Articles dating back to 2018 explain that Amazon has used AI for product recommendations for a long time. The company was touting updated generative AI ability even back then as its recommendation algorithm evolved.More recently, Amazon talked about the positive effects on retail that generative AI promises. The company is clearly enthusiastic about the possibility it offers for the company in better-recommending products to customers. Large Language Models (LLMs) help train AI to better pick up on nuance, which is kind of like having a salesperson who listens very, very well.AI-Recommended Blue-Chip Stocks: Nvidia (NVDA)Nvidia (NVDA) investment growth and profit trading concept. Nvidia company logo on screen of smartphone against blurred background of up trading stock chartSource: Below the Sky / Shutterstock.comBard: “Nvidia is a leading manufacturer of graphics processing units (GPUs), which are used in a variety of applications, including gaming, artificial intelligence, and data science. The company’s GPUs are essential for many AI applications, and its AI capabilities are helping it to expand into new markets, such as self-driving cars and healthcare.”The strength of Nvidia’s (NASDAQ:NVDA) stock has long been attributed to its expertise in GPUs. Those GPUs have again come to the fore due to the fact that they are essential to the most recent AI boom. Bard notes that Nvidia’s AI capabilities are incredibly important right now because it makes the most powerful AI chips. Those chips will be used to drive new efficiencies in new markets like autonomous vehicles and healthcare.Back in late May, Nividia shares spiked when it released earnings that included a Q2 revenue forecast of $11 billion due to AI advances. Prior to that shocker number, Wall Street had been anticipating $7.15 billion in Q2 sales.Share prices rocketed to $390 on that news. They’ve since risen again and are holding steady at around $430. Chip bans in China aren’t affecting prices, nor is much else. Investors are scared at the same time, though. Nvidia’s rapid rise and high volatility mean prices could drop dramatically, even if it continues to dominate AI for years to come.C3.ai (AI)C3.ai (AI) logo on a smartphone with computer screen showing graph in background, symbolizing AI stockSource: shutterstock.com/Below the SkyBard: “C3.ai is a software company that specializes in AI-powered enterprise applications. The company’s platform helps businesses to build and deploy AI solutions that can improve their operations, their customer service, and their decision-making.”Bard is exactly right in asserting that C3.ai (NYSE:AI) stock does all of those things listed immediately above. It is focused on the enterprise side of the AI spectrum. In time, C3.ai promises to become the leader in Ai enterprise deployments. However, I wouldn’t expect AI stock to move much in July. Instead, it should remain fairly stable. It has mostly missed the hype train that Nvidia has ridden much higher. That isn’t to say it hasn’t been justified in Nvidia’s case: It clearly has based on Q2 forecasts. But C3.ai hasn’t provided any similar projections. Instead, it is telegraphing growth in the 15% range. Is there anything wrong with that? No, it’s a very respectable number. However, it is inevitably being compared to Nvidia’s growth and therefore being judged as lackluster. In short, it’s going to take time for AI stock to grow. Shareholders who purchased in late 2022 have been rewarded handsomely. It should be flat through July since nothing is really happening. Bard and I disagree here. Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL)Google launches Bard AI. Google search bar on a phone in hand with release information on background. Google Bard AI vs OpenAI ChatGPT. GOOG stock and GOOGL stock.Source: salarko / Shutterstock.comBard: “Alphabet is the parent company of Google, which is one of the leading AI companies in the world. Google’s AI capabilities are used in a variety of products and services, including its search engine, its maps, and its translation tools.”Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL) is certainly what Bard bills it to be. It utilizes AI in all of the offerings listed above. I’m not so sure that I agree with Bard in recommending Alphabet shares at the moment, though. The reason is that Alphabet/Google’s ad business is facing a lot of scrutiny at the moment. That’s absolutely nothing new, as the company has been labeled a monopoly for a long time, especially in relation to its ad platform. EU regulators recently found ‘abuse’ of that platform that has advantaged Google since at least 2014. Google collects user data, sells space for advertising to those users through its website, and brokers the publishing of ads based on all of that info. It certainly has power over the entire ad. European regulators recommend Google’s ad business be broken up. That probably won’t happen so, especially given that tech stocks are holding the market up currently. A U.S. push is therefore unlikely soon. However, renewed scrutiny should hold prices steady, if not move them downward.AI-Recommended Blue-Chip Stocks: Micron Technology (MU)An outside image of a Micron Technology, Inc. headquarters. MU stock.Source: Charles Knowles / Shutterstock.comBard: “Micron Technology is a leading manufacturer of memory chips, which are used in a variety of devices, including computers, smartphones, and servers. The company’s memory chips are essential for many AI applications, and its AI capabilities are helping it to develop new products and services.”Everything Bard says about Micron Technology (NASDAQ:MU) stock is true in terms of its positioning in the chip market and potential in the AI market. However, it’s definitely a contrarian pick for July. The firm recently released fiscal Q3 earnings that weren’t inspiring. Revenues grew from $3.69 billion to $3.75 billion on a sequential basis. Let’s call that flat. Micron posted $8.64 billion in revenues during its fiscal Q3 a year ago, and $3.75 billion a year later is a drastic decline even if it’s above the midpoint of company guidance. The company anticipates slight top-line growth this quarter at $3.90 billion. Micron ramped up production during the pandemic, but so too did others. The race to supply memory chips led to a glut of supply in aggregate. Prices fell as a result, and Micron’s top line has suffered consequently. The reason to buy Micron now is that it is simply priced too low, not because there is any evidence that share prices should move upward soon. But that still makes it a great pick among AI-recommended blue-chip stocks.Tesla (TSLA)Tesla (TSLA) logo on a smartphone screen stock image. Tesla is an innovative company focused on producing sustainable electric vehicles and clean energy solutionsSource: ssi77 / Shutterstock.comBard: “Tesla is a leading electric vehicle manufacturer, and it is also investing heavily in AI. The company’s AI capabilities are used in its self-driving cars, its battery management system, and its manufacturing processes.”It’s always difficult to bet against Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) and its stock. The company seems to be forever a step ahead. Its move to lower prices and fight for greater volumes globally seems to have been a smart decision. When the company announced the move, it was immediately derided for having done so. The rationale was that Tesla’s lower margins would negatively affect it too strongly. Judging by share prices, that certainly hasn’t been the case.Further, the company is improving its operations as delivery and production numbers exceeded forecasts for the period ending June 30.Tesla delivered more than 446,000 vehicles as it was expected to deliver just under 446,000. The discount strategy then is also working in incentivizing demand for Tesla vehicles. That’s a strong positive for Tesla as it fights against EV brands vying for a share of the market in an increasingly competitive landscape, especially in China, where domestic brands offer real competition. That’s why it is one of my top picks regarding AI-recommended blue-chip stocks.On the date of publication, Alex Sirois did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

(NASDAQ:HAS) will pay a dividend of $0.70 on the 15th of August. This makes the dividend yield 4.4%, which will augment investor returns quite nicely. See our latest analysis for Hasbro Hasbro's Payment Has Solid Earnings CoverageIf the payments aren't sustainable, a high yield for a few years won't matter that much. Prior to this announcement, the company was paying out 323% of what it was earning. It will be difficult to sustain this level of payout so we wouldn't be confident about this continuing.According to analysts, EPS should be several times higher next year. If the dividend continues along recent trends, we estimate the payout ratio will be 47%, which would make us comfortable with the dividend's sustainability, despite the levels currently being elevated.historic-dividendHasbro Has A Solid Track RecordThe company has a sustained record of paying dividends with very little fluctuation. Since 2013, the annual payment back then was $1.44, compared to the most recent full-year payment of $2.80. This implies that the company grew its distributions at a yearly rate of about 6.9% over that duration. The dividend has been growing very nicely for a number of years, and has given its shareholders some nice income in their portfolios.The Dividend Has Limited Growth PotentialThe company's investors will be pleased to have been receiving dividend income for some time. However, initial appearances might be deceiving. Earnings per share has been sinking by 13% over the last five years. Dividend payments are likely to come under some pressure unless EPS can pull out of the nosedive it is in. Over the next year, however, earnings are actually predicted to rise, but we would still be cautious until a track record of earnings growth can be built.Hasbro's Dividend Doesn't Look SustainableIn summary, while it's good to see that the dividend hasn't been cut, we are a bit cautious about Hasbro's payments, as there could be some issues with sustaining them into the future. Although they have been consistent in the past, we think the payments are a little high to be sustained. We don't think Hasbro is a great stock to add to your portfolio if income is your focus.Story continuesCompanies possessing a stable dividend policy will likely enjoy greater investor interest than those suffering from a more inconsistent approach. At the same time, there are other factors our readers should be conscious of before pouring capital into a stock.

The company filed a patent application to operate “a virtual restaurant online featuring home delivery” in 2022, but given the downturn in consumer and VC interest in Web3, it begs the question: why now, why this and is Grimace there?Joining the land of McNuggets (which took me two attempts and over 10 minutes), you are greeted with pixelated McNugget characters such as “Coach McNugget” and his assistant, creatively named “Assistant Coach McNugget.”the coaches in McNuggets Land (The Sandbox)Coach McNugget invites players to start the fun by finding four McDonald’s signs, and what gamer doesn’t seek an adventure like this? But off I went to find them. By playing the game, players can earn rewards including a 100,000 SAND shared prize pool (roughly $44,000) and “mystery boxes,” according to a press release.The experience is spearheaded by the Hong Kong arm of McDonald’s, and Hong Kong users have the chance to win coupons as well as the big prize: “365-day free Chicken McNuggets.”The blocky world is adorned with the catchphrase “Please Share” on signs and in cartoonish speech bubbles which is meant to encourage sharing nuggets with friends but comes off as a desperate plea. (I’m reminded of Jeb Bush’s sad call to “please clap” on a 2016 campaign trail stop.)Randy Lai, the CEO of McDonald’s Hong Kong, said that “McDonald’s has always strived to deliver innovative experiences and Happy Moments” but unlike the recently viral Grimace birthday shake celebration in the U.S., the experience feels acutely marketed, with pixelated McNuggets spewing salesy phrases as part of the gamified experience. After being told which sauce each anthropomorphized nugget wanted to dip itself in before meeting its glorious end, I was ready to exit the virtual golden arches.Story continuesA McNugget Lauding Smoky Nacho Cheese Sauce (The Sandbox)The CEO of the Sandbox, Sebastien Borget, said in a press release that ""collaborating with a global brand like McDonald's, with its extensive customer base, takes The Sandbox to a new level and brings us closer to realizing the ultimate goal of mass adoption of the metaverse.”But does it? The Sandbox has had a number of big brands launch experiences and virtual worlds within its metaverse, including Adidas, Atari, Gucci and many others. I have personally found The Sandbox much easier to navigate and generally more fun than its rival Decentraland, which has struggled with maintaining a robust number of daily active users. That said, would I visit The Sandbox if my job wasn’t to cover Web3? Probably not.Brands have been trying activations in various metaverses for years that often toe the line between whimsical and cringe from Snapple opening a bodega to Taco Bell hosting a metaverse wedding. When food or drink is introduced into these experiences, people can’t help but wonder what the point of Miller Lite’s Meta Life Bar or spice maker McCormick’s “House of Flavor” was, when you can’t eat, drink or even smell in the metaverse.Recently, we saw convenience store 7-Eleven offer free Slurpee non-fungible tokens (NFTs) as part of their annual 7/11 day. The same day, snack brand Slim Jim launched the “Meataverse” and invited people to mint free “GigaJim” NFTs.Join us in the Meataverse and collect your free GigaJim today ✅👀https://t.co/K8YEJlVB8a pic.twitter.com/A9OJ5DCweT— Slim Jim 🚀 MEATA (@SlimJim) July 11, 2023While both activations saw some enthusiasm on Twitter upon launch, these gimmicky launches have melted into irrelevance already, with very few people talking about or trading NFTs from either one less than two weeks later.With much of the venture capital money moving from the metaverse to AI and giants like Disney shuttering their metaverse arms, brands throwing their hats in the Web3 ring now seems ill-timed. Launches which may have seemed silly but fun when crypto was riding high seem embarrassing and strange in 2023’s atmosphere of Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) crackdowns and ongoing crypto winter.If brands like McDonald’s want to have success in Web3, they have to give people a better “why” than what McNuggets Land offers. Starbucks’ Odyssey, the coffee company’s Web3 loyalty program has hit snags along the way, but makes more inherent sense by tying in its customers’ existing behaviors (buying coffee in their real stores) with virtual rewards and digital collectibles that give extra value to activities they are already doing. Along the way, Starbucks is creating a community and gathering valuable feedback it can incorporate when it rolls out Odyssey for all customers.The unhappiest meal of all in McNuggets Land: There was no Grimace in sight.]"

STX reported earnings of $1.59 per share in the prior-year quarter. The consensus estimate for revenues is pegged at $1.68 billion, suggesting a decline of 36% on a year-over-year basis.Management anticipates fourth-quarter fiscal 2023 revenues to be $1.7 billion (+/- $150 million). Non-GAAP loss is expected to be 20 cents per share (+/- 20 cents).The company has a negative earnings surprise of 61.8%, on average in the training four quarters. In the past year, shares of STX have lost 22.8% of their value compared with the sub-industry’s gain of 0.2%.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchFactors Setting the Tone for Q4Seagate’s performance is likely to have been affected by global macroeconomic turmoil (especially lower economic activity in China) and inflation. The company’s nearline demand among large customers is being affected due to elongated customer inventory correction and reduced IT hardware budgets.  Cautious spending patterns amid macroeconomic weakness by customers, including global enterprise OEMs and certain domestic cloud clients, are likely to affect the demand for mass capacity solutions in the near term. The enterprise, and video and image applications market have also been suffering from prevailing macroeconomic challenges.Moreover, declining trends witnessed in PC shipments in second-quarter calendar-year 2023 are likely to have negatively impacted HDD sales. This, in turn, may have affected STX’s performance in the quarter under review.Our estimate for revenues from the HDD segment is pegged at $1,448.4 million, indicating a plunge of 40% year over year. The estimate for the non-HDD (which includes enterprise data solutions, cloud systems and solid-state drives) segment is pegged at $234.8 million, implying an increase of 7.7% year over year.STX is focused on cutting costs to better align with changing market conditions and support its long-term business strategy. It is focusing on higher-return products and end markets while rationalizing resources for non-core businesses. In March, management announced another round of layoffs, which will affect about 1% of its total headcount or about 480 employees.The new restructuring is expected to be completed by the end of fourth-quarter fiscal 2023.

268,aab3ae84-fcc5-35c9-aafc-e82fbf04ce9a,NWL,2023-07-22,Earnings Preview: Newell Brands (NWL) Q2 Earnings Expected to Decline,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/earnings-preview-newell-brands-nwl-140023302.html,1689948023,STORY,"['NWL', 'KMB']","[The market expects Newell Brands (NWL) to deliver a year-over-year decline in earnings on lower revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended June 2023. This widely-known consensus outlook is important in assessing the company's earnings picture, but a powerful factor that might influence its near-term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates.The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report, which is expected to be released on July 28. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations, it's worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise.Zacks Consensus EstimateThis consumer products company is expected to post quarterly earnings of $0.13 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of -77.2%.Revenues are expected to be $2.15 billion, down 15% from the year-ago quarter.Estimate Revisions TrendThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 1.83% lower over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts.Earnings WhisperEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction).The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Story continuesThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Newell Brands?For Newell Brands, the Most Accurate Estimate is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bullish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of +2.63%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #5.So, this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Newell Brands will beat the consensus EPS estimate.Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?While calculating estimates for a company's future earnings, analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that Newell Brands would post a loss of $0.04 per share when it actually produced a loss of $0.06, delivering a surprise of -50%.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates three times.Bottom LineAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.Newell Brands doesn't appear a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.Expected Results of an Industry PlayerKimberly-Clark (KMB), another stock in the Zacks Consumer Products - Staples industry, is expected to report earnings per share of $1.48 for the quarter ended June 2023. This estimate points to a year-over-year change of +10.5%. Revenues for the quarter are expected to be $5.08 billion, up 0.3% from the year-ago quarter.Over the last 30 days, the consensus EPS estimate for Kimberly-Clark has been revised 0.6% up to the current level. Nevertheless, the company now has an Earnings ESP of -0.12%, reflecting a lower Most Accurate Estimate.This Earnings ESP, combined with its Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Kimberly-Clark will beat the consensus EPS estimate. Over the last four quarters, the company surpassed consensus EPS estimates two times.Stay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

With this in mind, we are always looking at value, growth, and momentum trends to discover great companies.Of these, perhaps no stock market trend is more popular than value investing, which is a strategy that has proven to be successful in all sorts of market environments. Value investors rely on traditional forms of analysis on key valuation metrics to find stocks that they believe are undervalued, leaving room for profits.On top of the Zacks Rank, investors can also look at our innovative Style Scores system to find stocks with specific traits. For example, value investors will want to focus on the ""Value"" category. Stocks with high Zacks Ranks and ""A"" grades for Value will be some of the highest-quality value stocks on the market today.One company value investors might notice is PACCAR (PCAR). PCAR is currently sporting a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy), as well as a Value grade of A.Investors should also note that PCAR holds a PEG ratio of 1.26. This figure is similar to the commonly-used P/E ratio, with the PEG ratio also factoring in a company's expected earnings growth rate. PCAR's industry currently sports an average PEG of 3.10. Over the last 12 months, PCAR's PEG has been as high as 1.32 and as low as 0.94, with a median of 1.15.Another valuation metric that we should highlight is PCAR's P/B ratio of 3.35. The P/B is a method of comparing a stock's market value to its book value, which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities. This stock's P/B looks attractive against its industry's average P/B of 5.70. Over the past year, PCAR's P/B has been as high as 3.37 and as low as 2.23, with a median of 2.71.Value investors also love the P/S ratio, which is calculated by simply dividing a stock's price with the company's sales. This is a prefered metric because revenue can't really be manipulated, so sales are often a truer performance indicator. PCAR has a P/S ratio of 1.51. This compares to its industry's average P/S of 2.3.Story continuesFinally, investors should note that PCAR has a P/CF ratio of 12.12. This data point considers a firm's operating cash flow and is frequently used to find companies that are undervalued when considering their solid cash outlook. This stock's P/CF looks attractive against its industry's average P/CF of 23.82. Over the past 52 weeks, PCAR's P/CF has been as high as 12.17 and as low as 8.57, with a median of 10.06.These figures are just a handful of the metrics value investors tend to look at, but they help show that PACCAR is likely being undervalued right now. Considering this, as well as the strength of its earnings outlook, PCAR feels like a great value stock at the moment.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

The union says it is prepared to strike if conditions are not met, a move that would be the largest work-stoppage at a single employer in U.S. history and could affect deliveries for millions of consumers including those of Amazon, a major UPS customer.A UPS spokesperson told Kiplinger in a statement Friday that the company is focused on reaching a tentative agreement before the current contract expires on Aug. 1 and that there are only a few issues remaining.“Through productive and respectful discussions at the bargaining table, we’ve reached agreement on nearly all of the union’s stated priorities, including agreements to add Martin Luther King Jr. Day as a paid day off, create more full-time roles and implement vehicle-safety solutions, like installing A/C in new package cars,” she said.UPS contacted the union on July 19 seeking to resume talks, the Teamsters said in a same-day statement. The contract represents the largest private-sector union contract in North America.The union says it is seeking a new five-year agreement that includes guarantees for better pay, increases the number of full-time jobs, addresses safety and health concerns about heat illness and provides stronger protections against managerial harassment.Earlier this week, a bipartisan group of lawmakers from the House and Senate sent similar letters to the heads of both parties urging them to reach an agreement by Aug. 1. If, however, an agreement is not reached, they said they would “respect our constituents’ statutory and constitutional rights to withhold their labor and initiate and participate in a strike.”Story continuesIn response, Teamsters General President Sean M. O’Brien praised their support in a July 19 statement. “By saying they will not intervene, these officials are doing right by the American workers and the labor movement,” he said.Last year, President Joe Biden signed a bill to avert a national railroad strike that, if it proceeded, was expected to have crippled the US economy.“Teamsters are reminding legislators how many UPS workers live and work in their jurisdictions, and we are demanding they do right by their constituents,” O’Brien said in the statement. He urged the rest of Congress to follow the lead of those who signed the letter.Related ContentKiplinger's Retail Outlook: Consumers Cautious, But Still SpendingAmazon Credit Card Delivers Prime Day, $200 Intro OfferHollywood Writers' Strike By The Numbers — And How Inflation Fits In]"

Teamsters are threatening to strike starting August 1 if a new contract is not reached. Yahoo Finance Legal Reporter Alexis Keenan explains where progress has and has not been made in the negotiations.Video Transcript- Well, the clock is ticking. UPS and the Teamsters are heading back to the negotiating table next week, just days before their contract expires. Yahoo Finance's Alexis Keenan has been following this story for us. Alexis, what can we expect, because it still seems like the two sides are very far apart.ALEXIS KEENAN: Maybe, maybe not. The two sides may be talking a little bit differently about where things stand. But this labor contract expires on August 1, so the parties say they're going to get back to the negotiation table next week. We don't know exactly what day, but it looks like they're going to have about seven or eight days to get this thing to yes.These are 340,000 Teamsters Union represented workers at UPS, so a huge employment group there. And talks broke down early in July. So the Teamsters have threatened a strike, and hopefully these talks will get back on the table. Now, UPS, for its part, says there's still time to get this done. They say they're near, they've nearly met all of the demands that the Teamsters workers are looking for, so let's take a look at them here.What's not settled is one of the Teamsters focus, which is on about 100,000 part-time workers. These are workers who work in the warehouse, they load and sort packages. They want their pay increase. Their current pay is about $20 an hour, plus, they get benefits. Also, full-time workers for UPS, we don't know what they want. That's still a big question here. We don't know where they stand. But it would be typical for pay to be increased with a new five-year contract.Also, what is already settled, according to UPS, are a variety of other things. One, is to convert hybrid workers-- these are full-time workers who work on Tuesday through Saturday, to convert them to regular full-time workers. They don't want that status anymore. They see themselves as second class workers. Their pay is $36.54 an hour plus benefits.Story continuesAlso, UPS says it's agreed to stop forcing overtime for unscheduled days for full-time workers. Also, adding more full-time jobs. Putting air conditioning in the cabs of its delivery vans for new trucks. Also, disabling some inward looking cameras inside the trucks, they're going to do that. And also adding a paid holiday, and adding some seasonal hours for part time workers.- And, Alexis, quickly, I'm just curious about the economic impact, first of what if UPS drivers all go on strike at the end of next week. But also, just more broadly, how the two sides are thinking about these conversations in the broader environment where you still have an unemployment rate that's 3.6%. It does seem like labor has a lot of leverage out there right now.ALEXIS KEENAN: Right. So advantage to labor, right, in that scenario, given the unemployment landscape, where is UPS going to find replacement workers if these workers go on strike. That seems like a really tall order. So certainly that, that concern there. But also, looking at other economic factors, supply chain issues, that could certainly hamstring those packages getting to businesses and individuals.But also, if you look at the idea of the shift going let's say to FedEx and USPS to pick up the slack here, look, they could definitely take advantage of that opportunity and raise prices for consumers and businesses. So all kinds of dominoes would be expected to fall if this strike does happen. But it looks like the parties are getting back into the negotiating rooms and are looking forward to being able to work something out.- And all of this coming at a time when one of the major trucking lines might also be going out of business come soon. Watch, watch the developments of Yellow, as well. Alexis Keenan, thanks so much.]"

With that, let me turn it over to Steve.Story continuesStephen Joseph SqueriGood morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us today for our second quarter earnings call. This was the sixth consecutive quarter of strong performance since we announced the growth plan in January of [2020]. Revenues of $15 billion grew 12% year-over-year and reached a record high for the fifth straight quarter. Earnings per share of $2.89 is also a quarterly record and is also up 12% over the last year. Based on our performance through the first half, we are reaffirming our guidance for the year of delivering revenue growth of 15% to 17% and EPS of $11 to $11.40. We also remain focused on achieving our growth plan aspirations of annual revenue growth in excess of 10% and mid-teens EPS growth in 2024 and beyond in a steady-state macro environment. I continue to feel very good about our ability to achieve these long-term aspirations. Let me tell you why. As I've said on previous calls and at investor conferences, we have a business model that's differentiated from others in the industry which gives us some important advantages. Our business model is built largely around a fee-based premium -- our fee-based premium products, which drive our spend-centric economics and produce a fast-growing stream of subscription-like revenues. Spending is the largest contributor of revenues while lending plays a more modest role in our model. This revenue mix is a key differentiator for us. It all starts with our premium customer base, which is built on our trusted brand. We have a global scale that's unmatched in the industry and leadership positions with a diverse range of high-quality customers. We build long-term relationships through our unique membership model, which we constantly evolve to attract new customers and grow with them over time. Our high spending Card Members attract a wider and merchants and business partners, giving our customers and partners even more reasons to stay with us, which fuels a virtuous cycle of growth. Partnerships play an important role in our model. We have a long history of partnering with brands who share our values of backing customers with world-class products and services and who value developing broad-based and long-term relationships with us. Hilton is one of those long-standing partnerships. Our relationship started 70 years ago when we opened a travel office at a Hilton hotel in Madrid that grew into a merchant relationship after we began issuing cards. And then became our first co-brand partner in the 90s. The partnership has lasted and grown over time because we evolve together and put our customers at the center of what we do. Today, I'm pleased to announce that we've signed a 10-year extension of our relationship with Hilton which includes continuing as the exclusive co-brand issuer of Hilton consumer and small business cards in the United States as well as extensions of our travel and merchant relationships.This extension builds on the strong foundation we've built over the years with Hilton and gives us a long runway to invest in products and services and (inaudible) that attract new customers and deepen our relationships with existing ones. It's a great example of the strength of our business model and that it touches virtually all aspects of our business, providing our customers and our partner with exceptional value. Our philosophy of making continuous strategic investments in our business model, is what's driving our growth today, and it's the way we plan to run our business going forward. For our second quarter performance, the power of our differentiated model can be seen in our results. Card Member spending hit another all-time high in the quarter with U.S. consumers and card members outside the U.S., both up by double digits, which offset some softness in U.S. small business. Millennial and Gen Z consumers continue to be the fastest-growing portion of our card member base with U.S. billings up 21% in the quarter. Of particular note, you'll recall that our international card business was our fastest-growing segment for several years prior to the pandemic, and it's again the fastest growing. We continue to see strong growth in travel and entertainment spending, which increased by double digits in the quarter and remains strong across customer categories and geographies. Q2 is a record quarter for restaurant reservations through our Resy platform, and bookings to our consumer travel business reached their highest levels since before the pandemic. We also saw continued strong demand for our premium products in the quarter. With over 70% of the new accounts we acquired on fee-based products and more than 60% of new customer accounts acquired globally are coming from Millennials and Gen Z. While a number of new accounts is important, we pay particular attention to the quality and potential revenues they represent. And when you look at the accounts we've acquired over the last year compared to those we acquired over a comparable period pre-pandemic. The overall revenue being generated by these new accounts is up substantially over 2019. Importantly, we continue to be thoughtful about who we grow with and how. And you see that in our results. Our credit metrics remain best-in-class, supported by the premium nature of our customer base, our robust risk management capabilities and a thoughtful underwriting actions we take on an ongoing basis that we've discussed with you on these calls over the last several quarters. Before I turn it over to Jeff, I want to take a couple of minutes to talk about our CFO transition. As we announced last month Jeff will be stepping down as our CFO on August 14, at which time, our deputy Control, our Deputy CFO, Christophe Le Caillec will become CFO of the company. First, I want to recognize Jeff and thank him for his outstanding tenure as our CFO for the past decade. He's been an invaluable partner and friend to me and to American Express throughout his time at the company. Jeff's Insights, strategic acumen and calm focused approach has helped us navigate through numerous challenges, including the unprecedented COVID Pandemic, while strengthening the company's overall financial position and the flexibility of our business model. Jeff is a person of exceptional integrity, and our company is stronger today because of him. While Jeff will officially be stepping down as CFO in mid-August, he'll be staying on as our Vice Chairman until next March, during which time he will be available to me, Christophe and our Executive Committee as we work on many of the important matters facing the company. Jeff, I speak for all of us at American Express when I say that it's truly been an honor and a pleasure working with you as our CFO these last 10 years. I also want to welcome Christophe who has been a trusted partner to our leadership team and a key contributor to our company's growth for 25 years. As our Deputy CFO, Christophe works closely with our executive in, Jeff and me to drive our financial strategy and performance. Over his tenure, he has served in finance leadership roles across the company. Christophe has gained a deep knowledge of all aspects of our business and his experience and thoughtful analysis play a key role in our strategic decision-making. I'm sure you all enjoy getting to know it. With that, I'll now turn it over to Jeff for his 85th earnings call as a public company CFO and his 41st and final call as the CFO of American Express.Jeffrey C. CampbellWell, thank you, Steve, and good morning, everyone. It's good to be here to talk about our second quarter results, which are tracking with the guidance we gave for the full year and reflects steady progress against our long-term growth aspirations. Starting with our summary financials on Slide 2. Our second quarter revenues were $15.1 billion, reaching a record high for the fifth straight quarter, up 13% year-over-year on an FX-adjusted basis. This revenue momentum drove reported net income of $2.2 billion and earnings per share of $2.89, up 12% year-over-year. This does represent a quarterly EPS record for the company and it also reflects the sequential strengthening we expected as we move through the year that I mentioned last quarter. Pretax pre-provision income was $3.9 billion, up 33% versus the same time period last year, reflecting the strong growth momentum in our underlying earnings. So now let's get into a more detailed look at our results, which in our spend-centric business model always begins with a look at volumes, which you see on Slides 3 through 7. In total, you see on Slide 3 that we did reach a new record level for spending on our network this quarter, with total network volumes and build business up 9% and 8% year-over-year, respectively, on an FX-adjusted basis. Of course, I'd remind you that growth rates were particularly elevated last quarter as we lapped the impact of Omicron in the first quarter of the prior year. We are now seeing the more stable rates that we expect are more representative of the kind of growth rates we will see in the balance of the year. Goods and services spending grew 6% overall in the second quarter. We saw good growth in goods and services spending in U.S. consumer and international card services of 8% and 15%, respectively, while this growth rate in U.S. SME did continue to slow down a bit further from last quarter. In contrast, we saw very strong growth in travel and entertainment spending across geographies and customer types, up 14% overall driven by sustained demand for travel and dining experiences. Looking forward, I would expect this growth rate to remain in the double digits through the rest of this year.Turning to our largest segment, U.S. consumer grew billing strongly at 10% this quarter. Millennial and Gen Z customers continue to drive our highest bill business growth within this segment. with their spending growing 21% year-over-year. You see our highest growth again this quarter in International Card Services with strong growth across both geographies and customer types. Spending from international consumers grew 16%, while spending from international SME and large corporate customers grew 19%. This strength in spending growth from our [U.S.] consumers and card members outside the U.S. offset the continued softness in U.S. SME spending growth that we have been talking about for the past few quarters. Looking at Commercial Services, U.S. SME growth came in at 2% this quarter. Looking forward, we will continue to monitor these spending trends. Our U.S. large and global corporate customers also grew billings 2% in the second quarter, as we've said for many years, these customers, while not a particular growth driver for our business to remain an important foundation for the company's business model. Taking all of this into account, spending volumes are tracking to support our revenue guidance for the year and our long-term aspirations for sustainable growth rates greater than what we were seeing per-pandemic. Now moving on to loans and Card Member receivables on Slide 8. We saw good continued sequential growth as well as year-over-year growth of 15%. Year-over-year growth moderated a bit this quarter as we expected, but remains elevated versus pre-pandemic levels. The interest-bearing portion of our loan and receivable balances continues to grow faster than the overall growth you see as our customers continue to rebuild balances. Importantly, the majority of this revolving loan growth in the U.S. continues to come from our high credit quality existing customers. We also included a disclosure this quarter showing that only [8%] of our U.S. Card Member loans and receivables comes from customers with a FICO less than 660. As you then turn to credit and provision on Slides 9 through 11, this high credit quality of our customer base continues to show through in our best-in-class credit performance. Our Card Member loans and receivables write-off and delinquency rates remain below pre-pandemic levels. Delinquency rates remained flat quarter-over-quarter while write-off rates continue to move up a bit this quarter as we expected, as you can see on Slide 9. Going forward, as we've talked about for many quarters now, we continue to expect these delinquency and write-off rates to increase over time, but they are likely to remain below pre-pandemic levels in 2023. Turning now to the accounting for this credit performance on Slide 10. The quarter-over-quarter growth in our loan balances was the primary driver of our $327 million for build. Although there was also a small component from incorporating a slightly worse macroeconomic outlook this quarter relative to last quarter. This reserve build, combined with net write-offs, drove $1.2 billion of provision expense in the second quarter. As you see on Slide 11, we ended the second quarter with $4.7 billion of reserves representing 2.6% of our total loans and card member receivables. This reserve remains about 30 basis points below the levels we had pre-pandemic or Day 1 CECL. We continue to expect this reserve rate to increase a bit as we move through 2023, while also reflecting the continued premiumization of our portfolio. Moving next to revenue on Slide 12. Total revenues were up 13% year-over-year in the second quarter on an FX-adjusted basis. Our largest revenue line, discount revenue grew 8% year-over-year in Q2, as you can see on Slide 13, driven by the spending trends we discussed earlier. Net card fee revenues were up 22% year-over-year in the second quarter on an FX-adjusted basis as you can see on Slide 14. Growth remains quite strong, and continues to be driven largely by bringing new accounts onto our fee-paying products. This quarter, we acquired 3 million new cards and the spend, revenue and credit profiles of these acquisitions continue to look strong relative to what we saw pre-pandemic. Importantly, the acquisition trends you see on Slide 14 in this and recent quarters are consistent with our long-term growth aspirations. Moving on to Slide 15, you can see that net interest income was up 32% year-over-year, driven primarily by the growth in our revolving loan balances. To sum up on revenues on Slide 16, we're seeing broad-based revenue growth across our revenue lines. We're tracking with our expectations. So looking forward, we still expect to see revenue growth within our range of 15% to 17% for the full year of 2023. The revenue momentum we just discussed has been driven by the investments we've made. And those investments show up across the expense lines you see on Slide 17. Starting with variable customer engagement expenses, these costs came in at 42% of total revenues in the second quarter and are tracking with our expectation for them to run at around 43% of total revenues on a full year basis. On the marketing line, we invested $1.4 billion in the quarter, on track with our expectation to have full year marketing spend of around $5.5 billion. We remain focused on driving efficiencies so that our marketing dollars grow slower than revenues while continuing to drive the high-quality (inaudible) that Steve discussed earlier. Moving to the bottom of Slide 17, brings us to operating expenses which were $3.4 billion in the second quarter, also tracking with our expectation for operating expenses to be around $14 billion for the full year. This quarter, you see that, as we expected, we have far less growth in OpEx relative to our high level of revenue growth. And looking forward, we continue to see OpEx as a key source of leverage. Turning next to capital on Slide 18. We returned $1.6 billion of capital to our shareholders in the second quarter, including common stock purchases of $1.1 billion and $446 million in common stock dividends, all on the back of strong earnings generation. Now as you know, this is an off-cycle year for Amex as a CCAR bank. Let me briefly remind you of our capital management approach. We generally increased our dividend roughly in line with earnings and target a 20% to 25% payout ratio. And you saw us do that as we increased our dividend by 15% to $0.60 per share last quarter. We target a CET1 ratio between 10% and 11%. And we ended the second quarter in the middle of that range at 10.6%. As we think about the potential finalization of Basel III, I'd remind you that our 10% to 11% CET1 target range is actually well above our current regulatory minimum of 7%. We plan to continue to return to shareholders the excess capital we generate while supporting our balance sheet growth and we don't expect any material near-term changes to our capital management approach, driven by the evolution of these rules. So that then brings us to Slide 19 in the growth plan. To step back for a minute, I joined American Express 10 years ago in 2013 because I was excited about the long-term growth prospects for the company. Today, as I join you from my last earnings call, I'm actually even more excited about those growth prospects. Steve and I first introduced our new multiyear growth aspirations back in January of 2022. And I would point out that Christophe was in the room for every key decision we made as we developed that plan with the senior business leaders across Amex. Now in July of 2023, we have consistently achieved the aspirations we set out 6 quarters ago, thanks to the great efforts of our 77,000 colleagues across American Express. So we are reconfirming today, our 2023 full year revenue guidance of 15% to 17% growth with EPS in the range of $11 to $11.40. Our revenue momentum and customer acquisition trends are positioning us well for our growth aspirations this year in 2024 and beyond. So this momentum, combined with this being my 85th consecutive earnings call across 3 industries without a break makes this a good time for me to transition the CFO role to Christophe. With that, I'll ask Christophe to say a few words before Steve and I take your questions.Christophe Le CaillecThank you, Jeff, and good morning, everyone. I'm excited to continue the strong legacy of performance that Steve and Jeff have delivered. I look forward to spending time with many of you on the call in the coming months. With that, I'll turn the call over back to Kerri to open up the call for your questions.Kerri S. BernsteinThank you, Christophe. Before we open up the lines for Q&amp;A, I will ask those in the queue to please limit yourself to just one question. Thank you for your cooperation. And with that, the operator will now open up the line for questions. Donna?Question and Answer SessionOperator(Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from Sanjay Sakhrani of KBW.Sanjay Harkishin SakhraniCongratulations, Jeff. You've had quite a run at American Express has been very helpful throughout your tenure and I'm sure you will be in your remaining position. Christophe, I look forward to working with you.My first question is on billed business growth. Obviously, there's so much noise over the last couple of years and even in this year. And I'm just -- Jeff, you talked about stabilization going forward and expecting that. Could you just talk about what gives you the confidence that you see that stabilization because we're still a little bit above trend in terms of that growth? And then what you need in the back half to get to that growth guidance on revenues?Jeffrey C. CampbellSo gosh, I guess I don't particularly Sanjay see as above trend. What gives us confidence is looking at what has actually happened in our business over the course of this year. In the first quarter, you were clearly lapping Omicron. And that was, in some ways, I think, the last of the pandemic-driven noise in our results. As you got into the second quarter, we have seen stabilization across geographies at a level that I would suggest is actually consistent with being in a pretty low-growth economy. And what we're hearing from us is with the kind of volume growth that you see this quarter, which we think has stabilized, which we think will continue. That is consistent with both the guidance we provided for this year as well as with our longer-term growth aspirations. I would point out, at some point, the economy is likely to get stronger, but even with the economy and its current kind of low growth state, the volume growth that we're seeing now allows us to achieve what we have been committing to for 6 quarters.Stephen Joseph SqueriYes. And look, I mean, just look at consumer, right? I mean consumer in the U.S. is up at 10%. T&amp;E is still very, very strong. We talked about travel bookings, travel bookings more than 1 month out are higher than they've been pre-pandemic. They were higher than they were at this time last year. They were higher than they were, obviously, in 2019. International is really coming back strong for us. And as we said, it's a fastest growing part of our business. And the other thing I'll point out is you just had -- you had a little hangover of noise from Omicron in this quarter because last year, you had a little bit of spending that was pushed from the first quarter to the second quarter. And if you look at -- if you go back and look sequentially last year was a huge increase sequentially quarter-over-quarter. So we feel really good about. I mean it's hard to apologize for record billings. And as Jeff said, it's the billings we need to hit our growth plans. So we feel really good about it. And the other point I'll just reiterate again is that, look, we're in a low-growth economy right now.We're still at the acquiring card members. Credit is really good. Our base is changing in terms of more Millennials and Gen Z who will grow with us. And as the economy gets better, we expect the spending to pick up. So we feel really confident.OperatorThe next question is coming from Ryan Nash of Goldman Sachs.Ryan Matthew NashGood morning, everyone.Jeffrey C. CampbellGood morning, Ryan.Ryan Matthew NashJeff, it's been a pleasure working with you and best of luck in the future. And Christophe, I'm looking forward to working with you in the future. Maybe to drill down into 2 areas that were highlighted on the call. First, commercial, obviously, we've seen a big slowdown there to 2% year-over-year growth. Steve, maybe just talk about what's driving the slowdown and what do we need to see for a reacceleration? And maybe just drill a little bit further on T&amp;E in terms of your confidence. Like it seems like sequentially, it may have slowed a little bit, but I think the point that year-over-year growth rates are still strong. So can you maybe just talk about what you see as the key drivers of that remaining in double digits?Stephen Joseph SqueriYes. I mean, from a T&amp;E perspective, and I think you just have to listen to our friends at Delta and what Ed had said, I mean, they're seeing record growth. And for us, we're seeing -- as we have a line of sight to future bookings. And so when you look at sort of consumer T&amp;E restaurant, not only is airline bookings up, but if you look at what's going on in restaurants in terms of Resy. I mean, restaurant is probably the biggest segment that we have in T&amp;E -- because we have all other, but we'll wind up disaggregating that. Yes, it grew 15%. And so we have really strong T&amp;E growth, and I think that people are just back traveling. And so the line of sight into what we see from Resy and the activity we see on Resy from a restaurant perspective, from the activity that we see in our consumer travel business, we feel really [confident] about that. As far as a small business and corporate, look, I think it's so about large corporate first. I think large corporate it's crawling its way back is the best way to describe it. It is a small piece of our business. It's about 5% of our business right now. It's an important piece of our business. And we value all of the corporate relationships that we have. But as many of us know, the first step is to get people into the (inaudible) and then the second step is to get them out onto the road. And I think what you're seeing a little bit less of is those one as one-stop trips, that quick hop to London to meet with that one client or that quick sort of run across the country to have an internal meeting, you're seeing less of that. So I think that will continue to come back. We continue to be aggressive, obviously, at retaining those customers and aggressive acquiring new customers, but I think that's going to be slower. I don't think that's coming back as fast, which is a contrast to consumer. A small business goes, I think when we look at small business, I think the biggest thing there from a small business perspective is really the organic growth. I think organic growth has slowed. I don't think that's a mix phenomenon. I think that's a little bit of an industry phenomenon. And I think small businesses grew very, very rapidly. And I think they have slowed down. What we have focused in on from a small business perspective is making sure we're continuing to acquire more small business customers, continuing to meet the other needs that they have, which are some lending needs for existing customers and also their deposit needs. And so as we grow both aspects of those business, -- and as when they're ready to grow again, we'll be ready to grow judiciously with them. And that's what we're focused on. So look, would we prefer that our SME business was growing like our consumer business, sure, we would. But there are these cycles. And at this particular point in time, I think you're seeing a little bit of an industry-wide slowdown from a small business perspective. But again, just to pick up on Jeff's point, from before, after the slowdown comes to recovery. So we'll be poised for that.OperatorThe next question is coming from Betsy Graseck of Morgan Stanley.Betsy Lynn GraseckAnd Jeff, all the best. It's been great working with you and Christophe looking forward to meeting you and working with you as well. I did just want to make sure I understood the guide on the rev outlook here because what I'm hearing and tell me where I'm wrong. What I'm hearing is that, billings growth you're anticipating something similar to what you generated this quarter on a year-on-year basis for the second half of this year. And that's a little bit of a slower pace obviously than the rev guide of 15% to 17%. Clearly, 1Q was very strong, well above that. So I'm just trying to understand if the other lines in revenue are going to more than make up for that. i.e., net interest income. Maybe you could speak to that a little bit or some of the other fee lines that drive your outlook for the 15% to 17% for the full year rev guide?Jeffrey C. CampbellSo I think it's an important question, Betsy. But if you really just look at this quarter, the thing I would point out is you do have some unusual noise in the service fees and other revenue line when you look at our Slide 12 in the slide deck. Because in the prior year, we had a complicated litigation settlement that drove some unusual movement in that line. What we're really saying is that we are in a low growth economy, but we -- it is consistent with the objectives we set if you maintain the volume growth that we have, and then combine it with the kind of consistent high growth in net card fees that you've seen right through the pandemic grew 21% this quarter. If you combine it with the fact that you still have customers rebuilding balances a little bit on the net interest income side. And you take the noise out on the service fee and other revenue side, you then easily get to a number that is very consistent in the back half of the year with what we've guided for the full year.Stephen Joseph SqueriYes. And I think he's a great example of the model, right? I mean, it's a great example of the related stool. But we've got you got card fee growth is very, very strong. I mean, it's the third -- I think it's the third straight quarter we've had a 20% card fee plus growth. Yes, we're benefiting a little bit from net interest income. As Jeff said, there's noise in the services fee and other revenue, and that will shift. But yes, we feel comfortable with billings around where we are today to make that revenue guidance because of the 3 tiers of the revenue that we have. So that's what gives us confidence.OperatorThe next question is coming from Rick Shane of JPMorgan.Richard Barry ShaneJeff, I often say this in these circumstances, a little bit tongue in cheek that we're going to miss you more than you're going to miss us, but I think that's absolutely here. It's been a pleasure working with you over the years and Christophe. We're looking forward to getting to know you as well. I do, Betty really as a pull on the thread that I'm interested in pursuing as well, but would love to sort of think about this a little bit more. When we look at the deceleration of top line in the second quarter, if revenue stays on that trajectory for the second half of the year, it sort of puts you at the low end of your top line guidance. It sounds like there's a little bit of noise that gives you some confidence, but I'm curious, fundamentally, do you think we will see some acceleration in the back half to sort of offset any potential risk if you just look at the trend line.Stephen Joseph SqueriWe still feel really confident that we'll be within the 15% to 17%. And there's really not a lot more to say other than that. So yes, you have a little -- as I said, you have a little bit of deceleration from a billings perspective. But it's a record quarter of billings, over $420 billion of billings. And so again, we feel very confident of the 15% to 17%, and we'll see where it winds up landing within that range. But the reason we give ranges.OperatorNext coming from Bob Napoli of William Blair.Robert Paul NapoliThank you very much. And Jeff, thank you for your help, and good luck to you, Christophe, welcome. I look forward to meeting you. I would like to ask about your views on credit normalization, kind of a trend in credit normalization. What -- as you look at your portfolio, what we should expect as we look at the aspirations for 2024. So the -- I mean, the back half of '23 is pretty baked, but just as we think about that going into 2024 and onward.Jeffrey C. CampbellWell, I think the most important point to make there, Bob, is that we have a portfolio today that is more premium and stronger than what we had in 2019 and Day 1 CECL. That is why we added the additional disclosure this quarter around the small percentage of our portfolio that is in the band where you do see challenges, and that's the FICO band below 660.So we feel really good about where we are from a credit perspective in this environment. I think we feel really good about the fact that when you look sequentially, you actually saw delinquencies flat. There is complexity in the CECL calculation when you try to do comparisons across companies. I did make the observation that the way and with the timing of how we do ours, we actually incorporated a slightly worse economic outlook this quarter than we did last quarter, sitting here on July 20. I think most people would say things have perhaps gotten a bit more optimistic in recent days. But we'll have to see how that influences things. At core, though, we feel really good about the product choices, the acquisition choices and the risk management choices we've made, which leave us confident that we will be below this year on credit metrics, all of the places we were in 2019. And absent some dramatic change in the economy, I think we feel good about what that means for 2024.OperatorThe next question is coming from Craig Maurer of FT Partners.Craig Jared MaurerOn, Jeff, for meeting you in the middle of a nice storm till now. I appreciate all the help over the years and Christophe looking forward to meeting you soon. So my question -- my 2 questions really are around: one, SME just wanted to dig in a little further there. If you can help me understand if there was a meaningful difference in growth between the total number and if you just looked at it on a same business activity level, and took out the new business adds. And second, has there been any real difference in credit vintages? We've recently seen some data on consumer loans that have shown a real deterioration in recent vintages of loans. So I wanted to ask about that.Stephen Joseph SqueriSo for the second question first, the answer is no. It's really not big, Jeff, do you want to....Jeffrey C. CampbellWell, with the only color I'd remind you, over the course of the past year, Craig, we have talked about the fact that we have consistently made some adjustments from a risk management perspective. And I think that is part of why, as Steve says, don't see any change from [management] perspective.Stephen Joseph SqueriYes. As far as line of sight into SME, I mean, the way to think about it is organic is probably flat. You obviously have businesses that go out of business. And so you have a little bit of sort of same stores that go away. But the acquisition is still relatively strong. So think about organic as having a neutral impact, think about attrition because attrition has a negative impact, but no different than what we've seen over the last few years and then acquisition in there. I think the biggest difference is really organic. And what you saw through the pandemic is, you saw a small businesses continue to add and add and add. And you got to remember, small businesses use a card to run their entire business. And so -- there was a lot of buying ahead from a goods and services perspective, from an inventory perspective. And so we're going to watch it really closely in terms of have they finally gotten to sort of full stock and what have you. And -- but I think that's the way to think about those 3 components: organic, basically flat and acquisition up and attrition pretty much stable.OperatorThe next question is coming from Lisa Ellis of Moffett Nathanson.Lisa Ann Dejong EllisYou guys highlighted that it is now 6 quarters since you introduced the structural increase in your long-term plan to double-digit revenue growth and mid-teens EPS growth. A lot has happened in the last 6 quarters. We're kind of finally returning to normal after the pandemic. So can you just highlight when you look at the underlying business drivers required to sustain that model on an ongoing basis, what is sort of doing better than you expected? Maybe where do you need to make some adjustments, et cetera? Just kind of comment on how that strategy and your thoughts about that has evolved as you look forward now back into a more normalized economy.Stephen Joseph SqueriYes. Well, I think you got to go back to sort of strategic priorities we always talk about, which is focused on premium consumer. We're focused on small business, and we're focused on coverage. If I look at this, I would say that international has come back probably even a little quicker than we had thought within our 3-year horizon. I think Millennials are playing out even better than what we had thought, both from an acquisition perspective and a spending perspective. I think when you think about boomers, I think they've been slower to return, but it's just -- it becomes a smaller piece of our business over time. Corporate, I think that's an opportunity going forward from a growth perspective. And I think small business started out in the beginning -- in all business will wind up being sort of a tale of 3 cities over this, over this time horizon. I think it was very, really strong for us last year. I think it's a little bit more muted it's a little bit more muted. And I think it will probably pick up. And the other thing that's been difference it's been -- when we started with this plan, it was done in a much slower -- it was done with -- we anticipated a more robust economy. So what really makes us feel good about this is that we've accomplished this in a slow growth environment. We've stayed true to who we are from a credit quality perspective. And the last thing that I'll add is, I think we've made some really great coverage gains over this period of time as we continue to march to our goals, especially international, where I think the team has done a really good job from a coverage perspective. And when you think about our longer-term partnerships here, we've really cemented in our key partnerships over the long-term here. Obviously, with Delta and with -- we still have Marriott and BA, which go out still a number of years. So we feel good about it. And the interesting part about this is, did it play out exactly as we thought it was going to play out? No. But the flexibility in the model has enabled it to go where we wanted it to go. And I think we really got off to a tremendous start in 2022 with tremendous revenue growth. I mean when we did this 3-year plan, we did not project 25% revenue growth last year. We were at 17% to 19%, I believe, when we started the year, then we took it up to 19% to 21%, and then you got 25%. So if you think about sort of where we thought we were going to be we're ahead of where we thought we were going to be longer-term, and the 15% to 17% guidance that we provided at the beginning of this year was based off original guidance that was 17% to 19%. So we're growing over bigger numbers. So and that's why I feel really good about it. And so we'll continue. And I think the most important thing for us is to stay focused and to focus on our priorities. And I think the team has done a really good job of that. And you have to remember, and you guys all know this -- this is a very good industry to be in. And when you play in this industry the way we play in it, across 3 different dimensions of card fees of billings and of net interest income, it makes our model completely differentiated from our competitors.OperatorThe next question is coming from Arren Cyganovich of Citi.Arren Saul CyganovichYour marketing expense pulled back a bit this quarter. You still have high customer acquisitions. How are you thinking about marketing expenses going into the second half of the year? And kind of quarter-to-date update in terms of your growth rates to [billed] business.Stephen Joseph SqueriWe're not going to do a quarter-to-date update on [billed] business. We're kind of 20 days in. So there's no real change. But in terms of marketing, the only thing that's important to know is that we said we'd spend about $5.5 billion on marketing. That's our plan to continue to do that. How it winds up sort of moving from quarter-to-quarter, I think we're probably $100 million from last year or something like this in this particular quarter. But that all depends on the programs we're running and the timing and everything else. And so a week here, a week there, can make all the difference in the world sometimes when you think about when you think about spending $1.5 billion, $1.4 billion in a quarter, it's like $100 million sort of a week. So the bottom line is we are committed to go after all the great opportunities that are out there, and we believe that we'll wind up spending about $5.5 billion from a marketing perspective. And just to remind everybody that the marketing spend for us is predominantly customer acquisition, right? And affiliate fees and incentives and things like that, it's not sort of TV and print and it's kind of advertising. That's what that marketing spend is. And that's why it can vary a little bit from quarter-to-quarter.OperatorThe next question is coming from Dominick Gabriele of Oppenheimer &amp; Co.Dominick Joseph GabrieleSo I was just wondering, when you think about your aspirational revenue target, has the thought process on the contribution to growth from net card fees to total revenue changed over time where it's potentially providing more of a boost towards that a 10% revenue goal versus the past versus discount revenue.Stephen Joseph SqueriNo, look, I think one of the big differentiators for us is that card fee. I mean you think about that as sort of subscription SaaS kind of revenue, and we're really pleased with that. But no, I mean, it's in the ballpark of what we what we thought it was going to be as we put together our aspirations, right? I mean -- and so when you look at this the 20% 3 quarters in a row is a big number. And another thing I'd point out during the pandemic, it was growing in double digits. And so -- which is -- it's a big contributor, and it's obviously a high -- it has higher growth than discount revenue would, but it's pretty much in line with where we thought we were going to be.Jeffrey C. CampbellI just can't resist that and Dominick for something that grew in double digits all through the pandemic has had really high growth rates last year. It is going to continue to grow to be an ever bigger part of our revenue pie. And I think that is a key strength of the company. It really ties customers and engages customers with us and the product and is a critical part of the overall model.Stephen Joseph SqueriYes. And just one other thing, because Jeff, just sort of remind me, as he said that when we talked about sort of this -- double-digit growth during the pandemic. It really speaks to how we think about our customers over the long-term because if we had not invested in our customers during the pandemic, you would not have seen that double-digit growth during the pandemic or coming out of the pandemic. It was really important to embrace those customers. It would have been easier to drop more money to the bottom line rather than to put more money into our existing customers, but that's not how we run the company. And we were thinking much more from a long-term perspective. And by really investing in the value proposition because, as you all remember, those value propositions from a travel perspective were challenged best. And to put other things in there, it really helped us cement those relationships, which kept those fees going, but more important, drop just normal attrition that we had because we improved our retention rates over the course of the pandemic. So I think it speaks to the membership model because this card fee is a decision that our members make to join the franchise. And that's really important because that means they see value in the product. They see ongoing value in the product. And it's our job, and we'll continue to do this to continue to insert more values into the product, and that's what keeps this thing going. And that's why from a strategic perspective, the consistent refreshing of our products is really, really important to our strategy.OperatorThe next question is coming from Don Fandetti of Wells Fargo.Donald James FandettiJeff, I want to clarify on the Basel comments. Are you saying that you won't have to run at a higher CET1 than your target of 10% to 11%. I know there was some concern around fees being looked at differently. I wonder if you can clarify that?Jeffrey C. CampbellDon, you were cutting out a little bit, but I think you're asking about the CET1 target and Basel III. And the point I was trying to make is you need to remember a few things here. Our 10% to 11% CET1 target is actually more driven by our own view and rating agency views versus the regulatory constraints . Because our regulatory minimum has long been only 7%. That's the first point. The second point to remember is we have a return on equity of over 30%. So our ability to quickly replenish capital whenever we need to without, frankly, taking more than a brief pause from share repurchase is very high. Third, I know there's been a lot of attention paid to different iterations of Basel, the Basel III end game, particularly around ops risk. I guess I'd also just remind people, ops risk is only one component. There are other components that probably have some positive and probably have some negative impacts on us. So I guess my -- but we'll have to see whenever the final rules come out. We've been waiting for them for actually like much of my tenure here. But they may come out hopefully later this month. And the devil is in the details here. But I think my overarching message is we don't see it as a material event for this company. Because it's certainly a possible outcome that there's no change in our target and even a modest change in our target with a 30%-plus ROE is not going to have any material impact on share repurchase or the trajectory of our EPS growth that we've laid out in the growth plan.OperatorOur final question is coming from Mihir Bhatia of Bank of America.Mihir BhatiaCongratulations, Jeff. Thank you for all your help, and welcome, Christophe. I look forward to getting to know and working with you. I wanted to switch gears a little bit and talk about the process revenues of the network partnerships, I think the old [GNS] business. It seems like there's been a little bit of momentum in terms of signing some new partners recently. I believe this quarter, we actually saw the launch of the Square Card and processed volumes grew faster than billed business this quarter. So just wondering if you could talk about that business a little bit more. Has there been something -- has something changed internally? Are you focused more on that segment? What's driving that momentum?Stephen Joseph SqueriYes. No, I don't think anything has changed. I think these are -- it's always been something that we have been focused on. But to switch or to get a partner to come on to the network is a big deal. And there are technical hurdles to wind up crossing. And we're -- the GNS team is out there on a consistent basis looking for new partners. And when you think about our overall model, we're really operating around 29 proprietary countries. All the rest of the markets that we operate around the world are GNS markets, either just from a card acceptance perspective or from a both a card acceptance and a card issuing perspective. And there's been a lot of work going on with GNS over the years to get -- to increasingly get more and more coverage. And so when you look at our improvements in coverage, so much of that's been driven by our GNS partners. And just to remind you that everything that we're doing in China really comes under the heading of GNS because we're in there just as a network. We don't acquire merchants. We don't issue cards, we have a joint venture, and that's a that's a GNS relationship. And look, our launch of our card, I mean, with Square, that's been in the pipeline for a long time. But it's -- if you aren't in cards or if you're issuing Visa MasterCard, it's a little bit different to [hook up] to our systems to get priority within your own system and so forth. And so we've been out there on a consistent basis, working to get partners. I think the Square One has a little bit more -- I guess a little bit more headlines because it's a U.S. partnership, but the team is out there on a real consistent basis all across Asia and South America and Africa and so forth, really thinking through how we continue to get more coverage and how we get more cards issued. So while you may see it a little bit more, I can tell you, the team has been working really hard at this for a lot of years.Kerri S. BernsteinGreat. And with that, we will bring the call to an end.

Yahoo Finance Live breaks down how earnings from components such as JPMorgan Chase and American Express impacted the index's action this week.Video TranscriptSEANA SMITH: Let's break down some of the biggest moves that we've seen over the last several trading days and taking a look at the Dow's performance over the last five days, closing up just about 2%. Like I just said, that 3-point gain that we did see today, enough for the Dow to close in positive territory here, Miles, for 10 straight trading days in a row.We've seen a number of Dow components report results over the last couple of trading days. Amex was out this morning. That disappointed the Street, the worst performer in the Dow today. But strong results from JP Morgan earlier this week. Johnson &amp; Johnson, that did give the index a little bit of a lift.- Yeah. And I think, you know, watching the Dow's performance this week is as watching, the market's overall start to do the rotation that all the bears thought needed to happen, otherwise, the market was going to go down, which is we had this narrow leadership where tech is doing all of the driving, pushing us higher. NASDAQ's up 35% or whatever it was at the peak. And everyone says, when's everybody else going to get into the mix.And you look at today's market on a sector level. And you have XLC Communication Services, that's down 1%. Meanwhile utilities are up 1.5%. Health care is up 1%. Energy is up 9/10 of 1%. So you're starting to see these more cyclical sectors get in the mix. That's a little bit more heavily weighted within the Dow. Certainly, the NASDAQ being a laggard, you know, would be indicative of that.But another interesting day in the sense of the indexes, you know, not really telling the story. Like, I think you have to look at sector level. And then certainly at some individual names where you had some action today. You know, look at the life sciences names. Names like Danaher, Thermo Fisher, they were big winners today.And so watching those dynamics play out has really been interesting here, as the market moves into the phase that again quote, unquote, everyone said we needed to enter if we were going to have a more constructive kind of bull run.]"

KBR secured a U.S. CENTCOM Support contract from the Air Force Contract Augmentation Program (AFCAP V) to provide mission-critical labor. The contract has a ceiling value of $69 million and a two-year base period with an eight-month option.Per the cost-plus contract, KBR is assigned to provide support personnel at three locations in the U.S. CENTCOM area of operations, including Ali Al Salem Air Base, Kuwait; Prince Sultan Air Base, Saudi Arabia and Al Dhafra Air Base, UAE, over the next two and a half years. The role involves assisting and guiding local and foreign nationals at U.S. military facilities across these three bases, potentially reducing deployment cycles for other critical missions.The company's deployment processing center, designed for surge support, has efficiently processed over 88,000 individuals for 150 contracts/task orders at 70 global locations over the past two decades. This contract represents a strategic expansion of KBR's portfolio in the CENTCOM area of operations, complementing the company's existing base operations support in Bahrain, the United Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabia.Contract Wins: A Boost for the BacklogShares of the company rose 31.9% in the past six months, outperforming the industry’s 19.7% gain. The trend is likely to continue, given the solid backlog level (including award options).Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchAs of Mar 31, 2023, the total backlog (including award options) of KBR was $20.89 billion compared with $19.76 billion at 2021-end. In first-quarter 2023, KBR received $3.1 billion in bookings and options in highly strategic areas, with a trailing 12-month book-to-bill of 1.4x.In first-quarter 2023, the Science &amp; Space division under the Government Solutions or GS, segment rose 10.3% to $279 million. Of the total backlog, GS booked $16 billion.Overall, KBR’s long-term, mission-critical programs provide strong visibility in volatile times. The company’s overseas logistics and mission support programs on the back of higher military exercise activities, increased outsourcing of sustainment activities by the military and the ramp up of the new wins led to its growth. Its determination to reduce emissions, product diversification, inorganic moves and strategic alliances bode well.Story continuesZacks Rank &amp; Key PicksKBR currently carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).Some better-ranked stocks from the Zacks Construction sector are:Dycom Industries, Inc.

But which of these two companies is the best option for those looking for undervalued stocks? Let's take a closer look.There are plenty of strategies for discovering value stocks, but we have found that pairing a strong Zacks Rank with an impressive grade in the Value category of our Style Scores system produces the best returns. The Zacks Rank is a proven strategy that targets companies with positive earnings estimate revision trends, while our Style Scores work to grade companies based on specific traits.Right now, Zimmer Biomet is sporting a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy), while Insulet has a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold). The Zacks Rank favors stocks that have recently seen positive revisions to their earnings estimates, so investors should rest assured that ZBH has an improving earnings outlook. But this is only part of the picture for value investors.Value investors analyze a variety of traditional, tried-and-true metrics to help find companies that they believe are undervalued at their current share price levels.Our Value category grades stocks based on a number of key metrics, including the tried-and-true P/E ratio, the P/S ratio, earnings yield, and cash flow per share, as well as a variety of other fundamentals that value investors frequently use.ZBH currently has a forward P/E ratio of 19.15, while PODD has a forward P/E of 202.47. We also note that ZBH has a PEG ratio of 2.60. This metric is used similarly to the famous P/E ratio, but the PEG ratio also takes into account the stock's expected earnings growth rate. PODD currently has a PEG ratio of 5.77.Another notable valuation metric for ZBH is its P/B ratio of 2.45. The P/B ratio is used to compare a stock's market value with its book value, which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities. For comparison, PODD has a P/B of 38.65.Story continuesBased on these metrics and many more, ZBH holds a Value grade of B, while PODD has a Value grade of D.ZBH has seen stronger estimate revision activity and sports more attractive valuation metrics than PODD, so it seems like value investors will conclude that ZBH is the superior option right now.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

GEHC is scheduled to report second-quarter 2023 results on Jul 25, before market open.In the last reported quarter, the company’s adjusted earnings per share of 85 cents surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 7.59%.Let’s take a look at how things have shaped up prior to this announcement.Factors at PlayIn January 2023, General Electric Company announced the completion of the spinoff of its healthcare business to create a new player in the field of Precision Care. From Jan 4, 2023, GE HealthCare started to trade on Nasdaq under the ticker symbol “GEHC.”GE HealthCare is expected to report strong organic revenue growth banking on balanced segmental performance. The quarter might have witnessed greater backlog fulfillment as supply challenges are gradually easing out. Further, improved pricing and successful commercial execution might have added to the top line in the second quarter.GE HealthCare Technologies Inc. Price and EPS SurpriseGE HealthCare Technologies Inc. Price and EPS SurpriseGE HealthCare Technologies Inc. price-eps-surprise | GE HealthCare Technologies Inc. QuoteIn terms of operating segments, Imaging revenue growth is expected to have been led by Magnetic Resonance as well as its molecular imaging entity, driven by supply-chain fulfillment improvements and growth in revenues from New Product Introductions (NPI).On the first-quarter 2023 earnings call, the company talked about its expectation of continued high growth throughout the first half of 2023 that will normalize throughout the rest of the year. Further, GEHC initiated a rolling 13-week schedule to maximize factory output and customer satisfaction to improve working capital. All these should get reflected in the second-quarter results of the Imaging business.Within Ultrasound, second-quarter organic revenue growth is expected to have been driven by strong performance of cardiovascular, general imaging and women’s health products on growing NPIs and improving supply chain fulfillment. The company had earlier noted that it expects to see strong customer demand in both hospital and other care settings through the months of 2023.Story continuesWithin the Patient Care Solutions business, the company is expected to have witnessed organic revenue growth, banking on favorable volume and pricing. Similar to the first quarter, GEHC is expected to have benefited from tools-side production for highly constrained products in the second quarter. Revenues are also expected to have been driven by the launch of key Magnetic Particle Imaging, such as CARESCAPE Canvas and the P100 series of acute cure molecules Patient Care Solutions contributing to increased volume.The company’s Pharmaceutical Diagnostics business is expected to have delivered organic revenue growth, driven by favorable price, increased procedures and stabilization of supply.However, overall, a strong commercial performance in the second quarter might have been largely dented by a challenging macroeconomic environment and currency headwinds.Q2 EstimatesThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company’s second-quarter 2023 revenues is pegged at $4.77 billion.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company’s second-quarter 2023 earnings per share is 86 cents.What Our Model SuggestsPer our proven model, a stock with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) along with a positive Earnings ESP has higher chances of beating estimates.

And out of all of the metrics and results to consider, earnings is one of the most important.Life and the stock market are both about expectations, and rising above what is expected is often rewarded, while falling short can come with negative consequences. Investors might want to try to capture stronger returns by finding positive earnings surprises.2 Stocks to Add to Your WatchlistThe Zacks Earnings ESP, or Expected Surprise Prediction, aims to find earnings surprises by focusing on the most recent analyst revisions. The basic premise is that if an analyst reevaluates their earnings estimate ahead of an earnings release, it means they likely have new information that could possibly be more accurate. The core of the ESP model is comparing the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate, where the resulting percentage difference between the two equals the Expected Surprise Prediction.The last thing we will do today, now that we have a grasp on the ESP and how powerful of a tool it can be, is to look at a qualifying stock. Humana (HUM) holds a Zacks Rank #2 at the moment and its Most Accurate Estimate comes in at $8.90 a share 12 days away from its upcoming earnings release on August 2, 2023.Humana's Earnings ESP sits at 0.25%, which, as explained above, is calculated by taking the percentage difference between the $8.90 Most Accurate Estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $8.88.HUM is just one of a large group of Medical stocks with a positive ESP figure. Zimmer Biomet (ZBH) is another qualifying stock you may want to consider.Zimmer Biomet is a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) stock, and is getting ready to report earnings on August 1, 2023. ZBH's Most Accurate Estimate sits at $1.86 a share 11 days from its next earnings release.For Zimmer Biomet, the percentage difference between its Most Accurate Estimate and its Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.82 is 2.34%.Story continuesBecause both stocks hold a positive Earnings ESP, HUM and ZBH could potentially post earnings beats in their next reports.Find Stocks to Buy or Sell Before They're ReportedUse the Zacks Earnings ESP Filter to turn up stocks with the highest probability of positively, or negatively, surprising to buy or sell before they're reported for profitable earnings season trading.

IDEXX Laboratories beat earnings estimates in all the trailing four quarters, the average surprise being 5.15%.Let’s look at how things have shaped up before this announcement.Factors at PlayCompanion Animal Group (CAG)Similar to the first quarter, the CAG business is expected to have gained from consistent organic growth in CAG Diagnostics’ recurring revenues. Within the United States, we anticipate solid volume growth, backed by new business gains, sustained customer retention levels and continued increases in diagnostic frequency and utilization at the practice level. Further, in the second quarter, U.S. CAG Diagnostic recurring revenue growth might have outpaced sector growth trends.IDEXX Laboratories, Inc. Price and EPS SurpriseIDEXX Laboratories, Inc. Price and EPS SurpriseIDEXX Laboratories, Inc. price-eps-surprise | IDEXX Laboratories, Inc. QuoteIn international regions, the segment is likely to have benefited from key execution drivers, including the benefits of higher price realization, solid new business gains and the expansion of the premium instrument base. However, these benefits are likely to have been moderated by the impacts of challenging global macro conditions, which continued to put pressure on same-store volume growth trends in the last reported quarter.We anticipate IDEXX to have achieved solid organic gains across its testing modalities in the second quarter. IDEXX VetLab consumables revenues are likely to have increased in the United States and international regions. Similar to the last quarter, gains are expected to have been supported by year-over-year growth in its global premium instrument installed base across the company’s Catalyst, Premium Hematology and SediVue platforms.Further, the worldwide placements of the ProCyte One hematology analyzer are likely to have sustained its growth momentum in the to-be-reported quarter. On the first-quarter earnings call, the company’s management noted that the installed base of this new piece of technology has more than doubled over the last year to 9,400 units.Story continuesIn the second quarter, global rapid assay organic revenues are likely to have been driven by strong growth in the United States, backed by solid volume gains and the benefits of higher net price realization. Global lab revenues are expected to have witnessed strong gains in the United States. Internationally, growth in key regions is likely to have been moderated by macroeconomic impacts, pressuring same-store sales.In terms of other areas of the CAG business, veterinary software and diagnostic imaging revenues are likely to have improved in the second quarter, banking on continued high levels of organic growth in recurring software and digital imaging revenues and continued strong momentum in cloud-based software placements.Our model projects revenues from the CAG segment for the second quarter to be $833.3 million, suggesting an improvement of 6.3% from the year-ago quarter’s reported figure.Water In the second quarter, IDEXX’s Water business is likely to have delivered impressive organic revenues in the United States, Europe and Latin America. On the first-quarter earnings call, management noted that progress made in the integration and performance of the recent Tecta-PDS acquisition has expanded IDXX’s capabilities in water safety testing.Per our model, projected revenues from this segment for the second quarter stand at $42.3 million, indicating a year-over-year improvement of 7.8%.Livestock, Poultry and Dairy (LPD)The segment is likely to have witnessed solid organic gains in the United States and Europe in the second quarter. However, in the last reported quarter, growth was offset by comparisons to high prior-year sales levels in herd health screening and reduced revenues from non-core food and safety products in certain regions.Our model projects revenues from the LPD segment for the second quarter to be $32.3 million, suggesting an improvement of 8.1% from the year-ago quarter’s reported figure. We anticipate the company to have worked through these comparison impacts and have delivered positive growth in LPD in the second quarter.Q2 EstimatesThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for IDEXX’s second quarter 2023 revenues is pegged at $928 million, suggesting an increase of 7.8% from the year-ago reported figure.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for its second quarter 2023 EPS of $2.43 indicates a 55.8% rise from the year-ago reported figure.What Our Model SuggestsPer our proven model, a stock with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold), along with a positive Earnings ESP, has a higher chance of beating estimates.

The Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues is pegged at $4,282 million, indicating 9.7% growth from the prior-year reported figure.The bottom line of the largest rural lifestyle retailer in the United States is expected to have increased year over year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings per share for the second quarter has moved down by 1.3% to $3.93 in the past 30 days. However, the figure suggests growth of 11.3% from the year-ago period’s reported figure.Tractor Supply has a trailing four-quarter earnings surprise of 0.5%, on average. In the last reported quarter, this Brentwood, TN-based company’s earnings missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 2.4%.Tractor Supply Company Price and EPS SurpriseTractor Supply Company Price and EPS SurpriseTractor Supply Company price-eps-surprise | Tractor Supply Company QuoteKey Factors to NoteTractor Supply has been grappling with inflationary pressure and rising costs for a while now. For instance, in the first quarter of 2023, its cost of merchandise sold and selling, general and administrative expenses (SG&amp;A) increased by 8.2% and 12.7%, respectively, on a year-over-year basis. SG&amp;A expenses, including depreciation and amortization, as a percentage of sales expanded 119 basis points (bps) year over year to 28.1% in the quarter.Higher costs, including elevated transaction expenses and integration costs related to the Orscheln Farm and Home acquisition, are expected to have hurt its margins and profitability in the second quarter of 2023. The company’s high capital expenditures related to its investments in new distribution centers and other growth initiatives might have impacted its margin performance.We anticipate Tractor Supply’s operating margin to contract by 10 bps in the second quarter. The company is likely to have witnessed an increase in SG&amp;A expenses, weighing on its operating margin. Our model indicates an 11.6% increase in SG&amp;A expenses on a year-over-year basis, with a 30-bps increase in the SG&amp;A rate.The company’s high-debt profile might have also been a concern. Exiting the first quarter, its long-term debt (including finance lease liabilities) was $1,164.1 million, reflecting an increase of 37.6% on a sequential basis. The rise in debt levels might have increased the company’s financial obligations and hurt its performance.However, the company has been benefiting from continued market share growth and progress on its strategic initiatives. Sturdy demand for everyday merchandise, including consumable, usable and edible products, as well as year-round products, is likely to have driven its top-line performance in the quarter to be reported. Solid demand for CUE products and DIY categories is also likely to have boosted the company’s performance. We anticipate Tractor Supply’s comparable store sales to increase by 5.3% in the second quarter.Tractor Supply has been focused on integrating its physical and digital operations to offer consumers a seamless shopping experience. The company has been on track with the ‘ONETractor’ strategy, which is aimed at connecting stores and online shopping. The company’s omnichannel investments include curbside pickup, same-day and next-day delivery, a re-launched website and a new mobile app. Gains from these efforts are expected to have led to strong e-commerce growth in the to-be-reported quarter.It has been on track with the Project Fusion remodels and Side Lot transformation to remain nationally strong and locally relevant by bringing the latest merchandising strategies to life. These have been significant investments toward stores and are expected to have boosted productivity across the existing and new stores. TSCO’s Neighbor's Club loyalty program is also likely to have driven its sales in the to-be-reported quarter.Story continuesWhat the Zacks Model UnveilsOur proven model does not conclusively predict an earnings beat for Tractor Supply this time around. The combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) increases the chances of an earnings beat.Tractor Supply has a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) and an Earnings ESP of -1.84%.

However, despite higher rates, the net interest margin (NIM) declined year over year. Also, higher expenses, along with a significant rise in provisions, were the undermining factors.Net income available to common shareholders was $1.35 billion, plunging 31% from the prior-year quarter.

Our estimates for NII and NIM were $7 billion and 6.64%, respectively.Non-interest income of $1.90 billion increased 11% from the prior-year quarter. The rise was driven by an increase in net interchange fees and other income. Our estimate for non-interest income was $1.75 billion.Non-interest expenses were $4.79 billion, rising 5%. The increase was due to a rise in salaries and associate benefit costs, occupancy and equipment costs, communications and data processing related costs, costs related to amortization of intangibles, and other expenses. We expected the metric to be $4.84 billion.The efficiency ratio was 53.20%, down from 55.67% in the year-ago quarter.

The company’s second-quarter performance is expected to have benefited from revenue growth across its operating segments, aided by an improved price/mix and an increase in concentrate sales. Underlying share gains in at-home and away-from-home channels are also expected to have bolstered the performance.The company’s volumes in the second quarter are expected to have benefited from the ongoing recovery in markets. Category-wise, volume has been benefiting from growth in trademark Coca-Cola; sparkling flavors; the nutrition, juice, dairy and plant-based beverages; and hydration, sports, coffee and tea categories.Our model predicts year-over-year organic revenue growth of 7.1% for the second quarter, mainly driven by 7.4% growth of the price/mix, offset by a 0.2% decline in concentrate sales volume. Consequently, reported revenue growth is expected to be 2.9%.Coca-Cola’s second-quarter results are likely to reflect gains from innovations and accelerating digital investments. The company has been witnessing a splurge in e-commerce, with the growth rate of the channel doubling in many countries. KO has been accelerating investments to build strong digital capabilities. It has been consistently strengthening consumer connections and piloting various digital initiatives through fulfillment methods to capture the online demand, which are likely to have boosted second-quarter sales.However, Coca-Cola has been witnessing pressures from higher supply-chain costs, including rising commodity input costs and transportation expenses. The pressures from input cost inflation and other costs are likely to have hurt the company’s performance in the second quarter.Coca-Cola has been investing in its markets and brands to support sales growth, with higher spending on consumer-facing activities. This has led to increased marketing investments in the past few quarters. Rising marketing spending, and growth in short-term incentives and stock-based compensation are expected to have led to increased selling, general and administrative expenses in the second quarter.As a percentage of sales, we expect SG&amp;A expenses to increase 90 basis points to 29.2% in the second quarter.On the last reported quarter’s earnings call, the company expected adverse currency rates to hurt the top and bottom lines in the second quarter. It expects a currency headwind of 3-4% on comparable revenues and 2-3% on comparable earnings per share for the second quarter. Additionally, revenues are expected to reflect a 1% negative impact of acquisitions.Story continuesZacks ModelOur proven model conclusively predicts an earnings beat for Coca-Cola this time around.

KBR secured a U.S. CENTCOM Support contract from the Air Force Contract Augmentation Program (AFCAP V) to provide mission-critical labor. The contract has a ceiling value of $69 million and a two-year base period with an eight-month option.Per the cost-plus contract, KBR is assigned to provide support personnel at three locations in the U.S. CENTCOM area of operations, including Ali Al Salem Air Base, Kuwait; Prince Sultan Air Base, Saudi Arabia and Al Dhafra Air Base, UAE, over the next two and a half years. The role involves assisting and guiding local and foreign nationals at U.S. military facilities across these three bases, potentially reducing deployment cycles for other critical missions.The company's deployment processing center, designed for surge support, has efficiently processed over 88,000 individuals for 150 contracts/task orders at 70 global locations over the past two decades. This contract represents a strategic expansion of KBR's portfolio in the CENTCOM area of operations, complementing the company's existing base operations support in Bahrain, the United Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabia.Contract Wins: A Boost for the BacklogShares of the company rose 31.9% in the past six months, outperforming the industry’s 19.7% gain. The trend is likely to continue, given the solid backlog level (including award options).Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchAs of Mar 31, 2023, the total backlog (including award options) of KBR was $20.89 billion compared with $19.76 billion at 2021-end. In first-quarter 2023, KBR received $3.1 billion in bookings and options in highly strategic areas, with a trailing 12-month book-to-bill of 1.4x.In first-quarter 2023, the Science &amp; Space division under the Government Solutions or GS, segment rose 10.3% to $279 million. Of the total backlog, GS booked $16 billion.Overall, KBR’s long-term, mission-critical programs provide strong visibility in volatile times. The company’s overseas logistics and mission support programs on the back of higher military exercise activities, increased outsourcing of sustainment activities by the military and the ramp up of the new wins led to its growth. Its determination to reduce emissions, product diversification, inorganic moves and strategic alliances bode well.Story continuesZacks Rank &amp; Key PicksKBR currently carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).Some better-ranked stocks from the Zacks Construction sector are:Dycom Industries, Inc.

What effect will this have on the economy as electricity prices continue to rise? Yahoo Finance spoke to experts across the industry to discuss how investors can benefit during these unprecedented times.A Dartmouth study calculated that extreme heat could cost countries between 1.5% - 6.7% of their GDP each year. A co-author of that study, Christopher Callahan, Dartmouth EEES PhD Candidate explained, ""When heat waves get more intense, economic growth goes down. And this can have compounding economic consequences.Laurence Chandy, UNICEF Director of the Office of Global Insight and Policy, emphasized the opportunity to invest in green energy. Chandy said, ""There are huge economic opportunities for people who want to invest in the green transition.""Raymond James Managing Director Pavel Molchanov broke down the impact of global water scarcity and how to combat it through desalination. Molchanov explained, ""Desalination is a vital aspect of what we call climate adaptation ... taking water from the ocean, removing the salt, and the result is water suitable for drinking, cooking, everything else.Interactive Brokers Chief Strategist Steve Sosnick discussed how rising electricity prices are impacting consumers. Sosnick said, ""If you have a fixed budget, and you're spending more of it to just keep the house cool to survive, that money's not going to be spent on other things.""Yahoo Finance Markets Reporter Ines Ferre broke down the impact of the heatwave on air conditioning stocks.

And this can have compounding economic consequences to the tune of multiple percent of GDP per capita over time.LAURENCE CHANDY: There is a tremendous opportunity to invest in the green transition globally. I think historically, we've mistakenly seen this as a trade off between do we protect the environment or do we continue to prioritize the economy. There are huge economic opportunities for people who want to invest in the green transition.PAVEL MOLCHANOV: Water scarcity is one of the most glaring consequences of the climate crisis. So desalination is a vital aspect of what we call climate adaptation. Desalination means taking water from the ocean, removing the salt, and the result is potable water suitable for drinking, cooking, everything else.STEVE SOSNICK: The amount of money that people are spending on utilities in a large swath of the country is enormous. And that money has to come from somewhere. If you have a fixed budget and you're spending more of it to just keep the house cool to survive, that money is not going to be spent on other things.INES FERRE: Those excessive heat warnings, the air quality warnings as well, that is giving AC stocks a boost as businesses try and consume less energy. They are upgrading to newer units. And then you also have the tailwind of the Inflation Reduction Act for individuals, for businesses if they get new heat pumps, if they get new air conditioning units, et cetera. So that's what you're seeing with this momentum with these stocks.[MUSIC PLAYING]]"

However, declining throughput volumes are likely to have hurt VLO’s bottom line in the second quarter.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Valero’s total throughput volumes in the second quarter is pegged at 2,896 thousand barrels per day, suggesting a decline from the 2,962 thousand barrels per day recorded in the year-ago quarter. Our estimate for total throughput volumes is pegged at 2,899 thousand barrels per day, also indicating a year-over-year decline.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Valero’s operating income from the refining segment is pegged at $2,844 million, suggesting a massive decline from the $6,212 million reported in the year-ago quarter. Our estimate for the metric is pegged at $2,886 million, also reflecting a year-over-year decline.Story continuesThis is likely to have affected Valero’s performance in the second quarter.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not indicate an earnings beat for Valero this time around.

Using the most recent financial data, we'll take a look at whether the stock is fairly priced by taking the expected future cash flows and discounting them to their present value. The Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model is the tool we will apply to do this. Before you think you won't be able to understand it, just read on! It's actually much less complex than you'd imagine.Remember though, that there are many ways to estimate a company's value, and a DCF is just one method. If you still have some burning questions about this type of valuation, take a look at the Simply Wall St analysis model. See our latest analysis for Valero Energy Step By Step Through The CalculationWe use what is known as a 2-stage model, which simply means we have two different periods of growth rates for the company's cash flows. Generally the first stage is higher growth, and the second stage is a lower growth phase. In the first stage we need to estimate the cash flows to the business over the next ten years. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.Generally we assume that a dollar today is more valuable than a dollar in the future, so we discount the value of these future cash flows to their estimated value in today's dollars:Story continues10-year free cash flow (FCF) estimate2024202520262027202820292030203120322033 Levered FCF ($, Millions) US$5.87bUS$5.11bUS$3.99bUS$4.01bUS$3.63bUS$3.42bUS$3.30bUS$3.24bUS$3.22bUS$3.23bGrowth Rate Estimate SourceAnalyst x9Analyst x4Analyst x1Analyst x1Est @ -9.29%Est @ -5.87%Est @ -3.47%Est @ -1.80%Est @ -0.63%Est @ 0.19% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 9.8% US$5.3kUS$4.2kUS$3.0kUS$2.8kUS$2.3kUS$1.9kUS$1.7kUS$1.5kUS$1.4kUS$1.3k(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$25bThe second stage is also known as Terminal Value, this is the business's cash flow after the first stage. For a number of reasons a very conservative growth rate is used that cannot exceed that of a country's GDP growth. In this case we have used the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield (2.1%) to estimate future growth. In the same way as with the 10-year 'growth' period, we discount future cash flows to today's value, using a cost of equity of 9.8%.Terminal Value (TV)= FCF2033 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$3.2b× (1 + 2.1%) ÷ (9.8%– 2.1%) = US$43bPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$43b÷ ( 1 + 9.8%)10= US$17bThe total value is the sum of cash flows for the next ten years plus the discounted terminal value, which results in the Total Equity Value, which in this case is US$42b. To get the intrinsic value per share, we divide this by the total number of shares outstanding. Compared to the current share price of US$121, the company appears around fair value at the time of writing. Valuations are imprecise instruments though, rather like a telescope - move a few degrees and end up in a different galaxy. Do keep this in mind.dcfImportant AssumptionsWe would point out that the most important inputs to a discounted cash flow are the discount rate and of course the actual cash flows. Part of investing is coming up with your own evaluation of a company's future performance, so try the calculation yourself and check your own assumptions. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Valero Energy as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 9.8%, which is based on a levered beta of 1.301. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.SWOT Analysis for Valero EnergyStrengthEarnings growth over the past year exceeded the industry.Debt is not viewed as a risk.Dividends are covered by earnings and cash flows.WeaknessDividend is low compared to the top 25% of dividend payers in the Oil and Gas market.OpportunityGood value based on P/E ratio compared to estimated Fair P/E ratio.ThreatAnnual earnings are forecast to decline for the next 3 years.Next Steps:Valuation is only one side of the coin in terms of building your investment thesis, and it ideally won't be the sole piece of analysis you scrutinize for a company. It's not possible to obtain a foolproof valuation with a DCF model. Preferably you'd apply different cases and assumptions and see how they would impact the company's valuation. For instance, if the terminal value growth rate is adjusted slightly, it can dramatically alter the overall result.

One way to achieve this is by employing the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model. There's really not all that much to it, even though it might appear quite complex.Remember though, that there are many ways to estimate a company's value, and a DCF is just one method. If you want to learn more about discounted cash flow, the rationale behind this calculation can be read in detail in the Simply Wall St analysis model. See our latest analysis for UnitedHealth Group Is UnitedHealth Group Fairly Valued?We're using the 2-stage growth model, which simply means we take in account two stages of company's growth. In the initial period the company may have a higher growth rate and the second stage is usually assumed to have a stable growth rate. In the first stage we need to estimate the cash flows to the business over the next ten years. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.A DCF is all about the idea that a dollar in the future is less valuable than a dollar today, so we need to discount the sum of these future cash flows to arrive at a present value estimate:Story continues10-year free cash flow (FCF) forecast2024202520262027202820292030203120322033 Levered FCF ($, Millions) US$27.4bUS$30.4bUS$33.8bUS$33.5bUS$33.5bUS$33.8bUS$34.2bUS$34.6bUS$35.2bUS$35.8bGrowth Rate Estimate SourceAnalyst x5Analyst x4Analyst x3Analyst x2Est @ 0.09%Est @ 0.70%Est @ 1.12%Est @ 1.42%Est @ 1.62%Est @ 1.77% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 6.9% US$25.7kUS$26.6kUS$27.7kUS$25.7kUS$24.1kUS$22.7kUS$21.5kUS$20.4kUS$19.4kUS$18.4k(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$232bWe now need to calculate the Terminal Value, which accounts for all the future cash flows after this ten year period. The Gordon Growth formula is used to calculate Terminal Value at a future annual growth rate equal to the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield of 2.1%. We discount the terminal cash flows to today's value at a cost of equity of 6.9%.Terminal Value (TV)= FCF2033 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$36b× (1 + 2.1%) ÷ (6.9%– 2.1%) = US$770bPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$770b÷ ( 1 + 6.9%)10= US$396bThe total value, or equity value, is then the sum of the present value of the future cash flows, which in this case is US$629b. The last step is to then divide the equity value by the number of shares outstanding. Relative to the current share price of US$507, the company appears a touch undervalued at a 25% discount to where the stock price trades currently. Remember though, that this is just an approximate valuation, and like any complex formula - garbage in, garbage out.dcfImportant AssumptionsWe would point out that the most important inputs to a discounted cash flow are the discount rate and of course the actual cash flows. You don't have to agree with these inputs, I recommend redoing the calculations yourself and playing with them. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at UnitedHealth Group as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 6.9%, which is based on a levered beta of 0.800. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.SWOT Analysis for UnitedHealth GroupStrengthEarnings growth over the past year exceeded the industry.Debt is not viewed as a risk.Dividends are covered by earnings and cash flows.WeaknessDividend is low compared to the top 25% of dividend payers in the Healthcare market.OpportunityAnnual earnings are forecast to grow for the next 3 years.Good value based on P/E ratio and estimated fair value.ThreatAnnual earnings are forecast to grow slower than the American market.Moving On:Whilst important, the DCF calculation is only one of many factors that you need to assess for a company. The DCF model is not a perfect stock valuation tool. Instead the best use for a DCF model is to test certain assumptions and theories to see if they would lead to the company being undervalued or overvalued. If a company grows at a different rate, or if its cost of equity or risk free rate changes sharply, the output can look very different. What is the reason for the share price sitting below the intrinsic value?

The index jumped more than 150 points yesterday to log its first nine-day rally since 2017, per a CNBC article. Better-than-expected earnings results from drugmaker Johnson &amp; Johnson JNJ boosted the index on Jul 20.Moreover, Dow Jones companies have come up with upbeat results this reporting cycle while tech biggies like Netflix (NFLX) and Tesla (TSLA) slumped post earnings release. SPDR Dow Jones Industrial Average ETF DIA has added about 3.8% past month versus a 3.5% uptick in the S&amp;P 500 (as of Jul 20, 2023) while DIA is up 2.4% in the past week versus 0.6% increase seen in the S&amp;P 500.Rising Bond Yields: A Tailwind for Dow JonesIf this was not enough, a spike in long-term U.S. treasury bond yields helped the value-centric Dow Jones gain precedence over the growth-oriented Nasdaq. The benchmark U.S. treasury yield was 3.85% on Jul 20, 2023, up 10 bps from the day before.Since value stocks perform better in a rising rate environment than growth stocks, Dow Jones had every reason to record jump yesterday. The trend is likely to be the same as the Fed is likely to hike rates this month amid a resilient economy and sticky inflation.Inside the Stocks That Played a Crucial Role Below we highlight a few stocks that played a crucial role in the Dow Jones’ latest rally. These stocks will likely help the Dow Jones to keep the momentum going.JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. (JPM) – Up 8.3% in Past Nine Days The Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) company is one of the biggest global banks. JPMorgan's shares have outperformed the industry in the past six months. The company acquired failed First Republic Bank for $10.6 billion, which is expected to be accretive to earnings.A resilient U.S. consumer base will likely help the bank as it has extensive consumer franchises. Increased credit card borrowing, higher loan charges, and robust consumer spending will likely act as strength for J.P. Morgan. Overall, higher rates, global expansion initiatives and a decent loan demand will support net interest income (NII). The stock has a Top Momentum Score of “A”.Story continuesUnitedHealth Group (UNH) – Up 9.3% in Past Nine Days The Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company provides a wide range of health care products and services, such as health maintenance organizations (HMOs), point of service plans (POS), preferred provider organizations (PPOs), and managed fee-for-service programs. UnitedHealth beat on both lines in the second-quarter 2023 earnings reporting season.On the basis of solid performance exhibited in the first half of 2023, adjusted net EPS is presently anticipated within $24.70 and $25.00, compared with the prior guidance of $24.50-$25.00. Net EPS are projected to lie between $23.45 and $23.75, compared with the previous view of $23.25-$23.75. The stock has a Top-rated Value score of “A” and Growth Score of “B.”Johnson &amp; Johnson (JNJ) – Up 5.7% in Past Nine DaysThe Zacks Rank #3 pharma company’s biggest strength is its diversified business model. It operates through pharmaceuticals, medical devices and consumer products divisions. The company beat on both lines in the ongoing earnings season. The company also hiked its full-year guidance.J&amp;J is now forecasting full-year sales of $98.80 billion to $99.80 billion, about $1 billion higher than the guidance provided in April. The company lifted its 2023 adjusted earnings outlook to $10.70 to $10.80 per share, from a previous forecast of $10.60 to $10.70 per share. J&amp;J has upbeat Value &amp; Growth score of “B.”Salesforce (CRM) – Up 9.1% in Past Nine DaysThe Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) company is the leading provider of on-demand Customer Relationship Management (CRM) software, which enables organizations to better manage critical operations, such as sales force automation, customer service and support, marketing automation, document management, analytics and custom application development.Salesforce is benefiting from a robust demand environment as customers are undergoing a major digital transformation.

314,1bd9459f-d651-3d2c-8949-add2d9db74c3,PG,2023-07-22,Procter & Gamble (PG) Reports Next Week: Wall Street Expects Earnings Growth,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/procter-gamble-pg-reports-next-140026659.html,1689948026,STORY,['PG'],"[Procter &amp; Gamble (PG) is expected to deliver a year-over-year increase in earnings on higher revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended June 2023. This widely-known consensus outlook gives a good sense of the company's earnings picture, but how the actual results compare to these estimates is a powerful factor that could impact its near-term stock price.The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report, which is expected to be released on July 28. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call, it's worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise.Zacks Consensus EstimateThis world's largest consumer products maker is expected to post quarterly earnings of $1.32 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +9.1%.Revenues are expected to be $19.93 billion, up 2.1% from the year-ago quarter.Estimate Revisions TrendThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has remained unchanged over the last 30 days. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts.Earnings WhisperEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction).The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Story continuesThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for P&amp;G?For P&amp;G, the Most Accurate Estimate is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bullish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of +0.09%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #3.So, this combination indicates that P&amp;G will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate.Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?While calculating estimates for a company's future earnings, analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that P&amp;G would post earnings of $1.32 per share when it actually produced earnings of $1.37, delivering a surprise of +3.79%.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates three times.Bottom LineAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.P&amp;G appears a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.Stay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company’s second-quarter revenues is pegged at $11.7 billion, suggesting 3.6% growth from the prior-year quarter’s reported figure.For second-quarter earnings, the consensus mark is pegged at 72 cents, suggesting a 2.9% rise from the year-ago quarter’s reported figure. The consensus mark has moved up by a penny in the past seven days.In the last reported quarter, the leading soft drink behemoth’s earnings beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 4.6%. The company has delivered an earnings surprise of 4.2%, on average, in the trailing four quarters.CocaCola Company (The) Price and EPS Surprise CocaCola Company (The) Price and EPS SurpriseCocaCola Company (The) price-eps-surprise | CocaCola Company (The) QuoteKey Points to NoteCoca-Cola’s performances in recent quarters have been benefiting from strategic transformation and ongoing recovery around the world. The company’s second-quarter performance is expected to have benefited from revenue growth across its operating segments, aided by an improved price/mix and an increase in concentrate sales. Underlying share gains in at-home and away-from-home channels are also expected to have bolstered the performance.The company’s volumes in the second quarter are expected to have benefited from the ongoing recovery in markets. Category-wise, volume has been benefiting from growth in trademark Coca-Cola; sparkling flavors; the nutrition, juice, dairy and plant-based beverages; and hydration, sports, coffee and tea categories.Our model predicts year-over-year organic revenue growth of 7.1% for the second quarter, mainly driven by 7.4% growth of the price/mix, offset by a 0.2% decline in concentrate sales volume. Consequently, reported revenue growth is expected to be 2.9%.Coca-Cola’s second-quarter results are likely to reflect gains from innovations and accelerating digital investments. The company has been witnessing a splurge in e-commerce, with the growth rate of the channel doubling in many countries. KO has been accelerating investments to build strong digital capabilities. It has been consistently strengthening consumer connections and piloting various digital initiatives through fulfillment methods to capture the online demand, which are likely to have boosted second-quarter sales.However, Coca-Cola has been witnessing pressures from higher supply-chain costs, including rising commodity input costs and transportation expenses. The pressures from input cost inflation and other costs are likely to have hurt the company’s performance in the second quarter.Coca-Cola has been investing in its markets and brands to support sales growth, with higher spending on consumer-facing activities. This has led to increased marketing investments in the past few quarters. Rising marketing spending, and growth in short-term incentives and stock-based compensation are expected to have led to increased selling, general and administrative expenses in the second quarter.As a percentage of sales, we expect SG&amp;A expenses to increase 90 basis points to 29.2% in the second quarter.On the last reported quarter’s earnings call, the company expected adverse currency rates to hurt the top and bottom lines in the second quarter. It expects a currency headwind of 3-4% on comparable revenues and 2-3% on comparable earnings per share for the second quarter. Additionally, revenues are expected to reflect a 1% negative impact of acquisitions.Story continuesZacks ModelOur proven model conclusively predicts an earnings beat for Coca-Cola this time around.

The company is expected to witness bottom-line growth when it reports second-quarter 2023 results. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for BYND’s quarterly loss has narrowed by 2 cents in the past 30 days to 81 cents per share. The consensus mark suggests a narrower loss from the $1.53 posted in the year-ago quarter.The Zacks Consensus Estimate Beyond Meat’s quarterly revenues is pegged at $111.3 million, which indicates a decline of 24.3% from the figure reported in the prior-year quarter. BYND posted a positive bottom-line surprise of 8.9% in the last reported quarter.

These, along with the adverse impacts of higher marketing investment, have been key deterrents.On the last reported quarter’s earnings call, management expected inflation to be the greatest challenge throughout 2023.Driven by the headwinds related to broad-based inflationary pressure and increased marketing investment, the company has been witnessing soft operating margins.Our model predicts the adjusted cost of sales, as a percentage of sales, to expand 20 basis points (bps) year over year to 45.5% in the second quarter. Adjusted SG&amp;A expenses are likely to increase 4.8% year over year to $1,164.9 million, with the SG&amp;A rate expanding 10 bps year over year. As a result, we expect the adjusted operating margin to contract 30 bps in the second quarter.Nonetheless, Keurig Dr Pepper is gaining from continued brand strength, significant pricing actions, solid performance in its cold beverages and strong market share gains. These traits have been boosting the company’s sales performance in recent quarters.KDP has been particularly gaining traction in the Refreshment Beverage segment for quite some time now. Higher net price realization and a rise in volume/mix have been the key contributors to the segment’s growth.The segment has witnessed strong traction from recent innovations, most notably Dr Pepper Strawberries &amp; Cream, effective in-market execution, and its recently announced sales and distribution partnership for C4 Energy. The continuation of this trend is expected to get reflected in the company's bottom line in the to-be-reported quarter.KDP is also witnessing remarkable trends on the market share front. The market share expansion has been mainly driven by strength in CSDs, seltzers, energy, apple juice, coconut waters and fruit drinks. Strength in Dr Pepper, Canada Dry, A&amp;W, Sunkist, Squirt and Crush CSDs, Polar seltzers, Vita Coco, C4 Energy, Mott's, and Hawaiian Punch have also been key contributors.Story continuesWhat the Zacks Model UnveilsOur proven model does not conclusively predict an earnings beat for Keurig Dr Pepper this time around.

But which of these two stocks is more attractive to value investors? We'll need to take a closer look to find out.We have found that the best way to discover great value opportunities is to pair a strong Zacks Rank with a great grade in the Value category of our Style Scores system. The Zacks Rank favors stocks with strong earnings estimate revision trends, and our Style Scores highlight companies with specific traits.Stericycle has a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy), while Waste Connections has a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold) right now. Investors should feel comfortable knowing that SRCL likely has seen a stronger improvement to its earnings outlook than WCN has recently. But this is just one factor that value investors are interested in.Value investors are also interested in a number of tried-and-true valuation metrics that help show when a company is undervalued at its current share price levels.The Value category of the Style Scores system identifies undervalued companies by looking at a number of key metrics. These include the long-favored P/E ratio, P/S ratio, earnings yield, cash flow per share, and a variety of other fundamentals that help us determine a company's fair value.SRCL currently has a forward P/E ratio of 24.08, while WCN has a forward P/E of 34.30. We also note that SRCL has a PEG ratio of 3.01. This figure is similar to the commonly-used P/E ratio, with the PEG ratio also factoring in a company's expected earnings growth rate. WCN currently has a PEG ratio of 3.07.Another notable valuation metric for SRCL is its P/B ratio of 1.72. The P/B is a method of comparing a stock's market value to its book value, which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities. By comparison, WCN has a P/B of 5.11.These are just a few of the metrics contributing to SRCL's Value grade of B and WCN's Value grade of C.Story continuesSRCL sticks out from WCN in both our Zacks Rank and Style Scores models, so value investors will likely feel that SRCL is the better option right now.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

If you want to see more stocks in this selection, check out 5 Under-the-Radar Stocks That Are on The Move.Valuations in the US equity market appear overstretched in the aftermath of stocks registering one of the best runs in the first six months of the year. Consequently, the race for stocks likely to deliver better-than-expected gains heading into yearend is heating up. The likes of Visa Inc. (NYSE:V) and Mastercard Incorporated (NYSE:MA) are increasingly emerging as some of the best plays as they show signs of breaking out after rallying to 52-week highs.The impressive run in the market depicted by the S&amp;P 500 rallying by more than 19%, Nasdaq by more than 30% year to date has been fueled by stocks that enjoy mass support. In addition, the stocks behind the rally are mostly of companies with unique elements of reliability and predictability. Unknown to most people is that under-the-radar stocks on the move could deliver better-than-expected gains because of their lack of predictability.It's common for investors to get hung up on big boys like Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) as they receive the biggest share of Wall Street attention. Therefore, their stock prices tend to react instantly, even on the smallest news.However, if you do not have an informational edge over other investors, generating value from the stocks might be difficult. Additionally, the initial investment capital in some of the stocks is usually high as some trade at a premium.To compensate for this mishap, it is common for investors to seek haven in under-the-radar stocks that are often not given the much-needed attention. While some are in less known industries, some are of smaller companies with solid, long-term prospects.While investing in under-the-radar stocks, having a long-term mindset to safeguard one's holdings from temporary headwinds is better. Additionally, such stocks offer a great way of diversifying an investment portfolio.Story continuesInvesting in under the radar stocks offers a great opportunity to invest in companies before they become household names. The investment can pay off on getting in early before the heard joins and fuels a significant move to the upside.The best under-the-radar stocks are mostly companies with a competitive edge, be it in the financial sector, tech, all even the industrial sector. For instance, some stocks were able to navigate the banking crisis early in the year to generate significant returns. On the other hand, stocks are well poised to do, even with the US economy's recession.12 Under-the-Radar Stocks That Are on The MoveSource: UnsplashAccording to CIC Wealth Executive Vice President Malcolm Ethridge, Mastercard and Visa are some of the stocks that sit well in the financial sector as they handle almost every credit card transaction in the US. While the focus has been on JPMorgan, especially on delivering better-than-expected Q2 results, Malcolm believes the two-payment processing company boasts a recession-proof model as they are embedded in every transaction worldwide.While investing in any stock, it's vital to look beyond the company's share price at that moment. The focus should always be on the underlying business at hand and its long-term prospects. Therefore, there might be better under-the-radar stock than the best under-the-radar stock. Instead, it is of companies with strong leadership, competitive advantage in their respective industries, strong financials, and solid paths to future growth.Our MethodologyWe used Finviz's stock screener to select the 12 under-the-radar stocks. We chose the stocks that are near their 52-week highs and have Upside Potential. These companies have strong potential and performance and can be great investment opportunities. We also checked hedge fund sentiment for each stock from our database of 943 hedge funds at the end of Q1.

To skip our detailed analysis, you can go directly to see the 5 most visited cities in North America.Even though it's been almost a year and a half since the major threat of the Covid-19 pandemic subsided, tourism, one of the hardest impacted industries in the world, is still yet to recover to pre-pandemic levels. However, there is still some good news as the World Travel &amp; Tourism Council has stated its belief that while the tourism industry may not recover fully this year, it will still be pretty close, which is huge news for a sector expected to be worth $9.5 trillion in 2023, and a major contributor to the global economy.The travel and tourism industry's resilience can be seen in the fact that after being completely decimated in 2020, it still recovered by 22% in 2021 and a further 25% in 2022. One of the biggest impediments to the travel industry's recovery was China's zero-Covid policy, which left little room for any travel to and from China, one of the biggest tourist markets in the world. This is why, now that China has abandoned this policy and opened its doors again, it is likely that the global tourism sector will recover fully in 2024. Already, in 2022, 34 out of 185 countries had seen their tourism levels rebound to pre-pandemic levels and an additional 50 countries will either fully or nearly, reach this target by the end of 2023, which will be especially great news for the most visited cities in North America.25 most visited cities in North Americabenemale/Shutterstock.comBecause of the pent-up demand, airlines were able to charge exorbitant prices for flight tickets resulting in some profitable quarters for some of the most profitable airlines in the world, even though many are still struggling to turn over a consistent annual profit. These airlines also find a lot in common with the richest airlines in the world, even though it is surprising to see that some low-cost and ultra low-cost carriers have still been able to amass large cash reserves. Because of higher prices as a result of higher demand and of course, the fact the fuel prices have decreased, many airlines have seen their share price soar including Delta Air Lines, Inc. (NYSE:DAL), as the airline sector's index reached a two year high due to greater demand from investors for stock. Delta Air Lines, Inc. (NYSE:DAL) has seen its share price rise by nearly 50% in 2023 alone with a large part being an increase in tourism to the most visited cities in North America, many of which are the most visited cities in the U.S. However, in contrast, Chinese airlines are worse off than they were towards the end of 2022 despite the ending of Covid-19 restrictions as the country's economy is struggling to recover. Of course, it's not just Chinese airlines which are struggling; American Airlines Group Inc. (NASDAQ:AAL) has seen its share price fall in recent weeks as a slowdown in earnings has led to investors becoming more cautious about the company's share price potential. Many other airlines are still seeing a much better recovery with Lufthansa's Head of Investor Relations stating ""Advance bookings for the coming months are very good. We are on the verge of the strongest summer in our company's history in terms of traffic revenue.""Story continuesOne of the reasons why Americans have been able to enjoy holidays more than in previous years is because of the U.S. dollar strengthening against its biggest rivals including the Euro and GBP. This is primarily a result of the Fed hiking interest rates rapidly in a bid to control rising inflation, not to mention Elizabeth Truss's short-lived Treasury policies, which resulted in the U.S. dollar almost reaching parity with GBP. You can learn more about this and the impact it had on Americans traveling abroad if you visit the 25 best countries for Americans to visit.While visiting European countries may be very alluring, the U.S. is second to none when it comes to one of the most visited countries in the world. In fact, the U.S. is home to some of the most diverse landscapes in the world, from deserts to beaches and mountains, from cities which attract the rich and famous to miles and miles of untouched landscape. Some of the top destinations in North America are well-known for their landmarks and popular tourist places, also marking them among the most recognizable cities in the world, right in line with some of the visited European cities in the world such as Paris, London and Milan. Separately, the most visited cities in North America are also among the most visited cities in the world, with Canadian and Mexican also super in demand countries. While many people may find the U.S. to be more expensive because of the way the U.S. dollar has strengthened, some areas in the U.S. can be very cheap to explore.MethodologySince the most reliable data on North American tourists was pre-pandemic data provided by Euromonitor and Mastercard, to determine the most visited cities in North America, we decided to rely on this information for our rankings based on the number of tourists to each city. We then supplemented this by counting additional U.S. cities which received a lot of visitors in 2021 but weren't among the top 100 cities in the world in 2018. Since the pandemic has decreased tourism significantly and was still a major threat in 2021, we have increased the visitors of these cities to three times what was officially reported in 2021, to come up with a like for like comparison among all such cities.25.

UHS is slated to report second-quarter 2023 results on Jul 25 after market close.Q2 EstimatesThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for Universal Health’s second-quarter earnings per share is pegged at $2.48, which indicates an improvement of 12.7% from the prior-year quarter’s reported figure.The consensus mark for revenues stands at $3,503 million, suggesting 5.4% growth from the year-ago quarter’s reported number.Earnings Surprise HistoryUniversal Health’s bottom line beat estimates in each of the trailing four quarters, the average surprise being 5.62%. This is depicted in the chart below:Universal Health Services, Inc. Price and EPS SurpriseUniversal Health Services, Inc. Price and EPS SurpriseUniversal Health Services, Inc. price-eps-surprise | Universal Health Services, Inc. QuoteFactors to NoteIn the second quarter, the top line of Universal Health is likely to have gained from growing patient volumes and increased surgical procedures. Strong contributions from the Acute Care Hospital Services and Behavioral Health Care Services segments are expected to have provided an impetus to UHS’s quarterly performance.Results of the Acute Care Hospital Services unit are expected to have benefited on the back of sustained demand for its services, which in turn, are likely to have attracted more customers and led to an increase in admissions. However, an elevated physician expense is expected to have hurt the performance of the unit.We expect the segment’s net revenues to be $1,941.3 million in the second quarter, which implies a rise of 3.5% year over year. Our estimate for same-facility adjusted admissions in acute care hospitals suggests 1.5% growth from the prior-year quarter’s reported figure.The Behavioral Health Care Services segment is likely to have been aided by higher adjusted patient days in the to-be-reported quarter. The growing incidence of mental health issues among Americans is expected to have sustained the solid demand for its behavioral health care services.Story continuesWe estimate net revenues in the Behavioral Health Care Services unit to be $1,546.4 million in the second quarter, suggesting 7.8% growth from the prior-year quarter’s reported figure. Our estimate for same-facility adjusted admissions in behavioral health facilities hints toward a 5.4% year-over-year rise. We also expect adjusted patient days to improve 420 basis points year over year to 4.9%.However, Universal Health’s margins are expected to have taken a hit from higher salaries, wages and benefits coupled with increased supplies expenses in the to-be-reported quarter. We expect salaries, wages and benefits to increase 4.9% year over year, while our estimate for supplies expense suggests 9.5% year-over-year growth.What Our Quantitative Model PredictsOur proven model does not conclusively predict an earnings beat for Universal Health this time around. The combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) increases the odds of an earnings beat.

So, it might be a good idea to review some of the factors that might affect the near-term performance of the stock.Over the past month, shares of this food and beverage company have returned +1%, compared to the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's +3.4% change. During this period, the Zacks Beverages - Soft drinks industry, which PepsiCo falls in, has gained 4.8%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?Although media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.Revisions to Earnings EstimatesRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.Our analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.PepsiCo is expected to post earnings of $2.17 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +10.2%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed +1.8%.The consensus earnings estimate of $7.46 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of +9.9%. This estimate has changed +2.6% over the last 30 days.Story continuesFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $8.04 indicates a change of +7.8% from what PepsiCo is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed +1.6%.Having a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, PepsiCo is rated Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPSProjected Revenue GrowthEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.For PepsiCo, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $23.4 billion indicates a year-over-year change of +6.5%. For the current and next fiscal years, $91.88 billion and $96.57 billion estimates indicate +6.4% and +5.1% changes, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryPepsiCo reported revenues of $22.32 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +10.4%. EPS of $2.09 for the same period compares with $1.86 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $21.61 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +3.3%. The EPS surprise was +7.18%.The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.ValuationNo investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.While comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.The Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.PepsiCo is graded C on this front, indicating that it is trading at par with its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.Bottom LineThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about PepsiCo. However, its Zacks Rank #2 does suggest that it may outperform the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

With climate change becoming a sensitive issue, investors, too, are trying shift their focus toward environmental, social and governance (ESG) inclined companies when it comes to adding stocks to their portfolio.What Are ESG Stocks?These companies are that prioritize sustainability and take into consideration environmental, social and governance factors rather than solely focusing on maximizing profits. While they still aim for profitability, their approach emphasizes reducing their environmental impact and promoting social responsibility.The metric evaluates the company's progress and achievements concerning its environmental, social, and governance initiatives. The environmental aspects pertain to a company's approach to climate change, striving for zero-carbon emissions, deforestation and overall ecological conservation.Social standards encompass the company's policies and approach toward its employees, suppliers, customers, and communities, while corporate governance focuses on assessing the company's management and leadership, pay structure, internal control, audits and protection of shareholders' rights.Why Add ESG Stocks to Your Portfolio?Eco-investing is gaining prominence as younger generations, particularly millennials and Gen-Z, are assuming a prominent role as investors in environmentally responsible companies. With climate change becoming a major concern among the youth, there is a noticeable socio-economic shift in favor of environmentally sustainable businesses.Moreover, ESG stocks offer the advantage of reducing portfolio risk. Companies that prioritize ESG factors often exhibit strong leadership, resulting in improved decision-making capabilities. As a result, these companies are better equipped to navigate market uncertainties and remain resilient during challenging times.Story continuesDo ESG Stocks Hold Promise?The ESG standard is still in its early stages, and only a few companies have embraced these initiatives. Consequently, there is limited historical evidence to suggest that ESG stocks consistently deliver better returns compared to other companies.Nonetheless, with growing consumer awareness and social consciousness, ESG stocks undoubtedly possess a competitive advantage. As consumers prioritize sustainability and social responsibility, companies that align with ESG principles are likely to gain favor and thrive in the market.Stocks to WatchSalesforce, Inc.

With many analysts covering the large-cap stock, we may expect any price-sensitive announcements have already been factored into the stock’s share price. But what if there is still an opportunity to buy? Let’s examine Union Pacific’s valuation and outlook in more detail to determine if there’s still a bargain opportunity. Check out our latest analysis for Union Pacific What's The Opportunity In Union Pacific?According to my valuation model, Union Pacific seems to be fairly priced at around 15.59% above my intrinsic value, which means if you buy Union Pacific today, you’d be paying a relatively fair price for it. And if you believe that the stock is really worth $187.54, then there isn’t really any room for the share price grow beyond what it’s currently trading. Although, there may be an opportunity to buy in the future. This is because Union Pacific’s beta (a measure of share price volatility) is high, meaning its price movements will be exaggerated relative to the rest of the market. If the market is bearish, the company’s shares will likely fall by more than the rest of the market, providing a prime buying opportunity.What kind of growth will Union Pacific generate?earnings-and-revenue-growthFuture outlook is an important aspect when you’re looking at buying a stock, especially if you are an investor looking for growth in your portfolio. Although value investors would argue that it’s the intrinsic value relative to the price that matter the most, a more compelling investment thesis would be high growth potential at a cheap price. With profit expected to grow by a double-digit 13% over the next couple of years, the outlook is positive for Union Pacific. It looks like higher cash flow is on the cards for the stock, which should feed into a higher share valuation.What This Means For YouAre you a shareholder? It seems like the market has already priced in UNP’s positive outlook, with shares trading around its fair value. However, there are also other important factors which we haven’t considered today, such as the financial strength of the company. Have these factors changed since the last time you looked at the stock? Will you have enough confidence to invest in the company should the price drop below its fair value?Story continuesAre you a potential investor? If you’ve been keeping tabs on UNP, now may not be the most optimal time to buy, given it is trading around its fair value. However, the positive outlook is encouraging for the company, which means it’s worth further examining other factors such as the strength of its balance sheet, in order to take advantage of the next price drop.If you want to dive deeper into Union Pacific, you'd also look into what risks it is currently facing.

But when you pick a company that is really flourishing, you can make more than 100%. For instance, the price of Ameriprise Financial, Inc. (NYSE:AMP) stock is up an impressive 138% over the last five years. On top of that, the share price is up 13% in about a quarter. But this could be related to the strong market, which is up 10% in the last three months.Since it's been a strong week for Ameriprise Financial shareholders, let's have a look at trend of the longer term fundamentals. See our latest analysis for Ameriprise Financial There is no denying that markets are sometimes efficient, but prices do not always reflect underlying business performance. One way to examine how market sentiment has changed over time is to look at the interaction between a company's share price and its earnings per share (EPS).Over half a decade, Ameriprise Financial managed to grow its earnings per share at 13% a year. This EPS growth is slower than the share price growth of 19% per year, over the same period. So it's fair to assume the market has a higher opinion of the business than it did five years ago. And that's hardly shocking given the track record of growth.You can see how EPS has changed over time in the image below (click on the chart to see the exact values).earnings-per-share-growthIt might be well worthwhile taking a look at our free report on Ameriprise Financial's earnings, revenue and cash flow.What About Dividends?When looking at investment returns, it is important to consider the difference between total shareholder return (TSR) and share price return. The TSR incorporates the value of any spin-offs or discounted capital raisings, along with any dividends, based on the assumption that the dividends are reinvested. So for companies that pay a generous dividend, the TSR is often a lot higher than the share price return. We note that for Ameriprise Financial the TSR over the last 5 years was 165%, which is better than the share price return mentioned above. This is largely a result of its dividend payments!Story continuesA Different PerspectiveIt's good to see that Ameriprise Financial has rewarded shareholders with a total shareholder return of 47% in the last twelve months. That's including the dividend. That gain is better than the annual TSR over five years, which is 22%. Therefore it seems like sentiment around the company has been positive lately. Given the share price momentum remains strong, it might be worth taking a closer look at the stock, lest you miss an opportunity. It's always interesting to track share price performance over the longer term. But to understand Ameriprise Financial better, we need to consider many other factors.

This company, which is in the Zacks Financial - Investment Management industry, shows potential for another earnings beat.This financial services company has an established record of topping earnings estimates, especially when looking at the previous two reports. The company boasts an average surprise for the past two quarters of 5.49%.For the last reported quarter, Ameriprise came out with earnings of $7.25 per share versus the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $7.13 per share, representing a surprise of 1.68%. For the previous quarter, the company was expected to post earnings of $6.35 per share and it actually produced earnings of $6.94 per share, delivering a surprise of 9.29%.For Ameriprise, estimates have been trending higher, thanks in part to this earnings surprise history. And when you look at the stock's positive Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction), it's a great indicator of a future earnings beat, especially when combined with its solid Zacks Rank.Our research shows that stocks with the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time. In other words, if you have 10 stocks with this combination, the number of stocks that beat the consensus estimate could be as high as seven.The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is related to change. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Story continuesAmeriprise has an Earnings ESP of +0.11% at the moment, suggesting that analysts have grown bullish on its near-term earnings potential. When you combine this positive Earnings ESP with the stock's Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), it shows that another beat is possibly around the corner. The company's next earnings report is expected to be released on July 26, 2023.When the Earnings ESP comes up negative, investors should note that this will reduce the predictive power of the metric. But, a negative value is not indicative of a stock's earnings miss.Many companies end up beating the consensus EPS estimate, but that may not be the sole basis for their stocks moving higher. On the other hand, some stocks may hold their ground even if they end up missing the consensus estimate.Because of this, it's really important to check a company's Earnings ESP ahead of its quarterly release to increase the odds of success.

In recent years, we have seen blockchain, cloud computing, quantum computing and artificial intelligence. But back in the early years of the internet, it was all about switches and routers. The leader back in the late 1990s and still the current leader today is Cisco Systems Inc. (NASDAQ:CSCO).The company is the largest provider of hardware and software solutions in the networking industry. Hardware products comprise switches, routers, data center and wireless applications. Security solutions is also an important area for the company and includes firewall and other software-defined products.Warning! GuruFocus has detected 3 Warning Sign with CSCO. Click here to check it out. CSCO 15-Year Financial DataThe intrinsic value of CSCOPeter Lynch Chart of CSCOCisco also became famous as become on of the biggest dot-com bubble stocks in 1999. After reaching high valuation levels in 1999, the stock has still not recovered from the highs it hit in March 2000.Hardware products still represent about half of annual revenue and the company and has been trying to diversify into software and subscriptions for quite some time now. This transition to software and subscription is taking longer than many analysts expected.Founded in 1984, the company is expected to generate $56.6 billion in revenue this fiscal year and currently has a $213 billion market capitalization.State of the industryThe international router and switch market was valued at $50.5 billion in 2022 and is expected to grow at a compound annual rate of approximately 6.3% from 2023 to 2030. This is driven by the growth in multiple points of connectivity as well as the demand for higher bandwidth throughput.Because of the development of cloud computing, internet of things and other technologies, the need for fast and reliable network connectivity has materially increased, which drives demand for routers and switches.Story continuesFinancial reviewOn May 17, Cisco reported fiscal third-quarter earnings for the period ending April 2023. Revenue grew14% to $14.6 billion, primarily driven by product segment revenues increasing 17% and service revenues increasing 3%. The company continued to make progress from a one-time product sale business model to more of a recurring revenue, subscription-type service.Annualized recurring revenue was $23.8 billion, an increase of 6% and product ARR increased 10%. Software revenue increased 18% to $4.3 billion with software subscription revenue increased 17% compared to the prior-year period.Adjusted net income was $4.1 billion, an increase of 13%, and earnings per share increased 15% to $1. Operating cash flow was $5.2 billion for the quarter, an increase of 43% compared with $3.7 billion in the year-ago quarter.The company has typically maintained a very safe balance sheet. At the end of the quarter, cash and short-term investments totaled $23.3 billion, while total debt was $8.4 billion. The backlog, or remaining performance obligations, increased 7% to $32 billion, of which 53% will be recognized over the next 12 months.In the third quarter, Cisco returned $2.9 billion to stockholders through share buybacks and dividends. Cash dividends paid totaled $1.6 billion and stock repurchases totaled $1.3 billion.Cisco CEO Chuck Robbins said, ""We once again delivered a strong quarter in a dynamic environment. In Q3, we delivered record revenue and double-digit growth in both software and subscription revenue. As key technologies like cloud, AI and security continue to scale, Ciscos long-established leadership in networking, and the breadth of our portfolio position us well for the future.""ValuationThe company has recently given annual guidance, which calls for 10% to 10.5% revenue growth and earnings per share in the range of $3.80 to$3.82. Consensus earnings estimates calls for $3.81 for this fiscal year ending July 2023 and $4.04 for the following year. However, these are non-GAAP estimates due to high levels of stock compensation paid out to the company. GAAP estimates are roughly $2.95 for this fiscal year and $3.05 for the following year. Stock compensation is a real expense, especially for tech companies and GAAP estimates should be considered. On that basis, Cisco is selling for 18 times this years estimates and 17 times the following year's estimates.The GuruFocus discounted cash flow calculator creates a value of approximately $63 when using earnings of $3.81 per share as the starting point and an 8% long-term growth rate.There are 17 Wall Street analysts that cover the company with an average price target of $55.46, a high target of $65 and a low target price of $45.The company pays an annualized dividend of $1.56, which equates to a 2.98% dividend yield currently.Guru tradesGurus who have purchased Cisco stock recently include Baillie Gifford (Trades, Portfolio) and Charles Brandes (Trades, Portfolio). Investors who have reduced their positions include Ken Fisher (Trades, Portfolio) and Chuck Royce (Trades, Portfolio).SummaryCisco appears to be fairly valued based on elevated multiples and lumpy growth rates. The business transformation to higher growth, recurring software and services is on track, but taking longer that expected. Nonetheless, the company is showing improved metrics in that area.The stock is selling near the top of its 52-week range, so it may be best for investors to wait for a pullback.This article first appeared on GuruFocus.]"

That's why I'm continuing this blog series to raise awareness about the power of Inclusive Language.Having a sense of identity is critical to all of us. In sharing our identities with the world, we seek to feel seen and accepted. This is certainly the case for the LGBTQ+ community.I'm joined by two colleagues in this conversation: Jennifer Rideout (Global Co-Lead, Pride Inclusive Community) and Abhinav Shikhar (APJC Co-Lead, Pride Inclusive Community). They share stories and thoughts about identity, acceptance, and the power of words.Jennifer: ""When people feel that their identity is threatened, it's human nature to react negatively.Remember, for people for whom language has always been inclusive - notably heterosexual, cis-gendered people - the shift to non-gendered words can feel challenging at first.For example, I know someone who attended a conference where, in conversation, someone asked about their spouse. This person was upset because they had a husband and were used to always being asked about their husband. Specifically, the word ""spouse"" was used.To them, it felt as though their identity wasn't seen. It was eye opening to realize that this person - and others who have enjoyed the privilege of language that caters to their identity - could feel excluded. Now their identity wasn't the only one being acknowledged through words.""While the feeling of being excluded because of language may have been a unique experience for that person, it's unfortunately common for those in the LGBTQ+ community.Suppose you grew up and lived in a society with language consistent with your identity. Now you're asked to change how to speak and incorporate inclusive language. You may feel newly excluded or threatened.Jennifer: ""Inclusive language is not intended to remove anyone's identity.Instead, the point is to expand respect and inclusion from some people to everyone. In individual conversations, you can be more specific and talk about your wife, husband, girlfriend, boyfriend, or being single - whatever aligns with who you are.Story continuesYour identity out to the world does not change, and you are still part of the whole; with inclusive language, we, the LGBTQ+ community, are simply saying: ""We want the same thing. We want language to include us, too.""Abhinav: ""I've experienced and witnessed multiple situations where people make gender-based assumptions about a significant other. I encourage people to think about how those assumptions developed over time and to question what they assume before they speak.Language missteps from assumptions occur in other situations, such as when people mentally assign gender based on a person's job title, role, appearance, or voice. It's not hard to check someone's identity, and it can make such a difference toward that person's feeling of acceptance.""It's more helpful to self-check our assumptions and work to rephrase discussions until we can verify identity and pronouns.It may seem small or unimportant, but it's huge for those on the receiving end who are consistently misunderstood.Jennifer: ""Yes, I was told recently by a colleague that they were laughed at after sharing their pronouns in a meeting. That type of response is completely inappropriate, unprofessional, and cruel.""It's dehumanizing to be mocked after sharing an important aspect of your personal story. What if you shared a personal story about a parenting challenge, for example, and the listener laughed at your situation?Respecting all identities creates a more welcoming and positive environment - personally or in the workforce. Two simple steps make an incredible difference:Don't assumeVerifyBefore you meet for the first time, take a moment to look someone up in your corporate directory or on LinkedIn to verify their name and pronouns.As of May 4, Cisco's employee directory includes pronouns. We encourage you to publish your pronouns and verify the pronouns of your coworkers. If you don't know or can't find out, just ask.Abhinav: ""As you learn more about and practice using inclusive language, think of yourself as an ally. Don't think of achieving perfection because there's always more to learn. For example, when talking with a leader a few weeks ago, talking casually about families, he did not assume that the man's partner was a woman.He showed inclusive behavior by using ""they"" when referring to the partner, which was greatly appreciated. Being an ally is a journey. You can be anywhere along the journey and continue to learn more.""Language is one of the most tangible ways to have us all feel seen. As we celebrate PRIDE month, extend your allyship with the LGBTQ+ community. It's more than rainbow stickers and apparel, rather it's about the everyday practice of being an ally all year long!Explore additional resources to boost your understanding and use of inclusive language:Inclusive Leadership via Language - Cisco BlogsUndertsanding Inclusive Language: A Framework Berkeley HaasA perspective on ""Words make Worlds""View original content hereView additional multimedia and more ESG storytelling from Cisco Systems Inc. on 3blmedia.com.Contact Info:Spokesperson: Cisco Systems Inc.Website: https://www.3blmedia.com/profiles/cisco-systems-incEmail: info@3blmedia.comSOURCE: Cisco Systems Inc.View source version on accesswire.com: https://www.accesswire.com/769560/Cisco-Walk-a-Mile-in-Their-Shoes-Creating-Awareness-and-Mutual-Respect]"

That is, the group stands to benefit the most if the stock rises (or lose the most if there is a downturn).Since institutional have access to huge amounts of capital, their market moves tend to receive a lot of scrutiny by retail or individual investors. Therefore, a good portion of institutional money invested in the company is usually a huge vote of confidence on its future.Let's take a closer look to see what the different types of shareholders can tell us about Cisco Systems. See our latest analysis for Cisco Systems ownership-breakdownWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Cisco Systems?Many institutions measure their performance against an index that approximates the local market. So they usually pay more attention to companies that are included in major indices.We can see that Cisco Systems does have institutional investors; and they hold a good portion of the company's stock. This implies the analysts working for those institutions have looked at the stock and they like it. But just like anyone else, they could be wrong. When multiple institutions own a stock, there's always a risk that they are in a 'crowded trade'. When such a trade goes wrong, multiple parties may compete to sell stock fast. This risk is higher in a company without a history of growth. You can see Cisco Systems' historic earnings and revenue below, but keep in mind there's always more to the story.earnings-and-revenue-growthInstitutional investors own over 50% of the company, so together than can probably strongly influence board decisions. We note that hedge funds don't have a meaningful investment in Cisco Systems. The Vanguard Group, Inc. is currently the company's largest shareholder with 9.4% of shares outstanding. With 8.4% and 4.5% of the shares outstanding respectively, BlackRock, Inc. and State Street Global Advisors, Inc. are the second and third largest shareholders.Story continuesOur studies suggest that the top 25 shareholders collectively control less than half of the company's shares, meaning that the company's shares are widely disseminated and there is no dominant shareholder.Researching institutional ownership is a good way to gauge and filter a stock's expected performance. The same can be achieved by studying analyst sentiments. There are a reasonable number of analysts covering the stock, so it might be useful to find out their aggregate view on the future.Insider Ownership Of Cisco SystemsThe definition of company insiders can be subjective and does vary between jurisdictions. Our data reflects individual insiders, capturing board members at the very least. The company management answer to the board and the latter should represent the interests of shareholders. Notably, sometimes top-level managers are on the board themselves.I generally consider insider ownership to be a good thing. However, on some occasions it makes it more difficult for other shareholders to hold the board accountable for decisions.Our data suggests that insiders own under 1% of Cisco Systems, Inc. in their own names. Being so large, we would not expect insiders to own a large proportion of the stock. Collectively, they own US$75m of stock. In this sort of situation, it can be more interesting to  see if those insiders have been buying or selling. General Public OwnershipThe general public-- including retail investors -- own 24% stake in the company, and hence can't easily be ignored. This size of ownership, while considerable, may not be enough to change company policy if the decision is not in sync with other large shareholders.Next Steps:I find it very interesting to look at who exactly owns a company.
