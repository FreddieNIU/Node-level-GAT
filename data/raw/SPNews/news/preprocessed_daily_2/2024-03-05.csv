SWEGX bears a Zacks Mutual Fund Rank of 1 (Strong Buy), which is based on various forecasting factors like size, cost, and past performance.', 'Objective', 'SWEGX is classified in the Allocation Balanced segment by Zacks, which is an area full of possibilities. Here, investors are able to get a good head start with diversified mutual funds, and play around with core holding options for a portfolio of funds. Allocation Balanced funds look to invest across a balance of asset types, like stocks, bonds, and cash, though including precious metals or commodities is not unusual; these funds are mostly categorized by their respective asset allocation.', 'History of Fund/Manager', ""Schwab Funds is based in San Francisco, CA, and is the manager of SWEGX. Schwab MarketTrack Allocation Equity Portfolio made its debut in May of 1998, and since then, SWEGX has accumulated about $730.57 million in assets, per the most up-to-date date available. The fund's current manager is a team of investment professionals."", 'Performance', 'Investors naturally seek funds with strong performance. This fund carries a 5-year annualized total return of 9.94%, and it sits in the top third among its category peers. But if you are looking for a shorter time frame, it is also worth looking at its 3-year annualized total return of 7.55%, which places it in the top third during this time-frame.', ""It is important to note that the product's returns may not reflect all its expenses. Any fees not reflected would lower the returns. Total returns do not reflect the fund's [%] sale charge. If sales charges were included, total returns would have been lower."", ""When looking at a fund's performance, it is also important to note the standard deviation of the returns. The lower the standard deviation, the less volatility the fund experiences. The standard deviation of SWEGX over the past three years is 16.86% compared to the category average of 16.15%. Over the past 5 years, the standard deviation of the fund is 18.66% compared to the category average of 17.98%. This makes the fund more volatile than its peers over the past half-decade."", 'Risk Factors', ""Investors should not forget about beta, an important way to measure a mutual fund's risk compared to the market as a whole. SWEGX has a 5-year beta of 0.99, which means it is likely to be as volatile as the market average. Because alpha represents a portfolio's performance on a risk-adjusted basis relative to a benchmark, which is the S&P 500 in this case, one should pay attention to this metric as well. Over the past 5 years, the fund has a negative alpha of -3.63. This means that managers in this portfolio find it difficult to pick securities that generate better-than-benchmark returns."", 'Expenses', 'As competition heats up in the mutual fund market, costs become increasingly important. Compared to its otherwise identical counterpart, a low-cost product will be an outperformer, all other things being equal. Thus, taking a closer look at cost-related metrics is vital for investors. In terms of fees, SWEGX is a no load fund. It has an expense ratio of 0.39% compared to the category average of 0.79%.

This payment means the dividend yield will be 1.0%, which is below the average for the industry.', ' View our latest analysis for Range Resources ', ""Even a low dividend yield can be attractive if it is sustained for years on end. However, prior to this announcement, Range Resources' dividend was comfortably covered by both cash flow and earnings. As a result, a large proportion of what it earned was being reinvested back into the business."", ""EPS is set to fall by 3.1% over the next 12 months. If the dividend continues along recent trends, we estimate the payout ratio could be 9.6%, which we consider to be quite comfortable, with most of the company's earnings left over to grow the business in the future."", ""Although the company has a long dividend history, it has been cut at least once in the last 10 years. The dividend has gone from an annual total of $0.16 in 2014 to the most recent total annual payment of $0.32. This works out to be a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of approximately 7.2% a year over that time. It's good to see the dividend growing at a decent rate, but the dividend has been cut at least once in the past. Range Resources might have put its house in order since then, but we remain cautious."", ""With a relatively unstable dividend, it's even more important to see if earnings per share is growing. It's encouraging to see that Range Resources has been growing its earnings per share at 64% a year over the past five years. Earnings have been growing rapidly, and with a low payout ratio we think that the company could turn out to be a great dividend stock."", ""Overall, we think that this is a great income investment, and we think that maintaining the dividend this year may have been a conservative choice. The earnings easily cover the company's distributions, and the company is generating plenty of cash. We should point out that the earnings are expected to fall over the next 12 months, which won't be a problem if this doesn't become a trend, but could cause some turbulence in the next year. All in all, this checks a lot of the boxes we look for when choosing an income stock."", ""Investors generally tend to favour companies with a consistent, stable dividend policy as opposed to those operating an irregular one. Still, investors need to consider a host of other factors, apart from dividend payments, when analysing a company. Case in point: We've spotted 2 warning signs for Range Resources (of which 1 is a bit unpleasant!) you should know about. Looking for more high-yielding dividend ideas?

33,6953f7e5-239b-3a8e-a59f-aed01eb4d3cb,HBAN,2024-03-05,Huntington Bancshares (NASDAQ:HBAN) Has Announced A Dividend Of $0.155,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/huntington-bancshares-nasdaq-hban-announced-130306494.html,1709643786,STORY,['HBAN'],"['The board of Huntington Bancshares Incorporated (NASDAQ:HBAN) has announced that it will pay a dividend of $0.155 per share on the 1st of April. This means the annual payment is 4.6% of the current stock price, which is above the average for the industry.', ' See our latest analysis for Huntington Bancshares ', ""If the payments aren't sustainable, a high yield for a few years won't matter that much."", ""Having distributed dividends for at least 10 years, Huntington Bancshares has a long history of paying out a part of its earnings to shareholders. Past distributions do not necessarily guarantee future ones, but Huntington Bancshares' payout ratio of 49% is a good sign as this means that earnings decently cover dividends."", 'Over the next 3 years, EPS is forecast to expand by 30.8%. Analysts estimate the future payout ratio will be 47% over the same time period, which is in the range that makes us comfortable with the sustainability of the dividend.', 'The company has a sustained record of paying dividends with very little fluctuation. The annual payment during the last 10 years was $0.20 in 2014, and the most recent fiscal year payment was $0.62. This works out to be a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of approximately 12% a year over that time. We can see that payments have shown some very nice upward momentum without faltering, which provides some reassurance that future payments will also be reliable.', ""Investors who have held shares in the company for the past few years will be happy with the dividend income they have received. Unfortunately, Huntington Bancshares' earnings per share has been essentially flat over the past five years, which means the dividend may not be increased each year. The company has been growing at a pretty soft 0.5% per annum, and is paying out quite a lot of its earnings to shareholders. This could mean the dividend doesn't have the growth potential we look for going into the future."", 'Overall, we think that this is a great income investment, and we think that maintaining the dividend this year may have been a conservative choice. Distributions are quite easily covered by earnings, which are also being converted to cash flows. Taking this all into consideration, this looks like it could be a good dividend opportunity.', 'Companies possessing a stable dividend policy will likely enjoy greater investor interest than those suffering from a more inconsistent approach. Still, investors need to consider a host of other factors, apart from dividend payments, when analysing a company. Companies that are growing earnings tend to be the best dividend stocks over the long term.

Cruise operators and travel agents report heightened interest due to the relative affordability of cruises compared to land-based alternatives. Despite cancellations in other travel sectors, cruise bookings for 2024 are anticipated to break records. With occupancy levels steadily approaching pre-pandemic levels, cruise operators are contemplating adjustments in pricing strategies to capitalize on the skyrocketing demand. However, this heightened interest in cruise vacations comes against the backdrop of cancellations and postponements of travel plans to other regions, particularly the Middle East. The Cruise Lines International Association predicts 35.7 million passengers in 2024, a 6% increase from 2019.\xa0', 'However, the industry faces a challenge in meeting the demand. Carnival CEO Josh Weinstein highlighted concerns about potential inventory shortages despite a 5% increase in capacity compared to 2023. Smaller operators, such as Oslo-based luxury cruise line SeaDream Yacht Club, report overwhelming demand for bookings in 2024 and beyond, with reservations already open for autumn 2026. Similarly, travel agencies like Marvelous Mouse Travels and InteleTravel have experienced a significant uptick in demand, surpassing pre-pandemic booking levels by considerable margins. Cruise operator Royal Caribbean observed a surge in first-time cruisers. To benefit from this opportunity, online travel companies, including Booking.com, are capitalizing on this trend, launching cruise verticals to cater to the growing demand.', 'The latest trends in the cruise industry, as highlighted by CLIA, indicate a strong focus on younger generations, with 88% of millennials and 86% of Gen-X travelers who have previously cruised expressing plans to cruise again. Additionally, there is growing interest among millennials and Gen-Xers who have never cruised, with 73% considering a cruise vacation. Similarly, solo cruise travel is on the rise, prompting cruise lines to enhance offerings for solo travelers by increasing single-cabin availability. Moreover, the commitment to environmental considerations is rising among current and potential cruise travelers, with 50% expressing increased dedication to making travel decisions based on environmental impacts. Additionally, expedition cruises are experiencing a surge in popularity, driven by the desire for immersive, responsible, and bucket-list travel experiences. This trend is evident across all age groups, with the number of passengers on expedition cruises more than doubling from 2016 to 2022.', 'On January 10, 2024, Chicago Tribune quoted Michelle Fee, the CEO and founder of Cruise Planners, an organization with over 2,500 travel agency franchises:', '“It’s not pent-up demand anymore.

Thanks so much, Mike. And hey, thanks everyone for being on the call. Look, as you can see from these numbers, we've had just an incredible quarter, well, actually we've just had an incredible year here at Salesforce with strong performance across all of our key metrics, revenue, margin, EPS, cash flow and of course our CRPO. Look, it's been an extraordinary year of transformation for Salesforce, you'll know that you've all been there with us. You've been the support that we have needed during this year. Thank you to all of our shareholders, and thank you to all of our stakeholders. It’s been a year of incredible transformation for our industry with the emergence of this next generation of artificial intelligence as well."", ""It's been really two unbelievable things happening at once. The total transformation of Salesforce and the total transformation of our industry. All right. Let's start with the transformation of Salesforce, okay? Look it was over a year ago, we said, Salesforce had to transform and you, many of you came to me, came to our whole team and you said, look, we're going to transform the whole company. We did it together. We could not have done it without you. We said we will restructure our business for the short and long term, we did that. We said we would place a laser focus on increasing productivity and operational excellence from across the board, we've done that. We said we were going to double down on innovation to make our core products even better, we've done that."", ""And when you see what's coming in Trailhead DX next week, you're not going to believe it. Not just our next generation artificial intelligence, not just -- that was not just our prompt builder, not just our copilot, but this data cloud which I'm going to get to in a second are fastest, most exciting new product ever, fastest growing, most customer traction that I have ever seen. That has been incredible. So let's talk about all of this and let's talk also about how we have also strengthened our relationships with our investors. Thank you, Mike, for everything you've done. And Amy, together with the management team, with our Board, we've really focused on you, the investor community. We've accomplished all of that together. We've completely transformed this company together and we're very grateful to each and every one of you."", ""And that transformation, well, it has driven incredible results. You're seeing productivity is up, profitability is up, margins up, revenues up and you're going to see it again in our results for our quarter. You're going to be looking at these full year numbers with phenomenal cash flow, with incredible margin growth, well, margin growth that I've never seen in any software company over the last 12 months -- 18 months. It's completely unprecedented. And you can see the incredible speed and success of the transformation that we've undertaken. Now we believe that Salesforce not only needs to be a great software company for our customers, our employees, our communities, but also a great company for our shareholders as well. We've certainly seen that with the exceptional performance of our equity over the last few months."", ""Now I'm thrilled that we're opening the door to another incredible part of our ongoing transformation today with the introduction of our first ever dividend. And that's amazing to say that word for the first time in 25 years in Salesforce history, our first ever dividend, which you're going to hear more about from Amy in a moment. And if this year has shown anything, if it's shown anything at all, it really shows that we've committed to serving all of our stakeholders. We closed out fiscal year '24 with $9.29 billion in revenue for the fourth quarter. That's up 11% year-over-year, 10% in constant currency. Pretty awesome at our size and scale, incredible. Eight of our top 10 deals in the quarter included six or more of our clouds, really showing the depth and breadth of our product line and our portfolio."", ""And all of our top 10 wins included sales, service and platform, and we're really focused on delivering that full cocktail of all of our clouds to all of our customers. And our deals greater than $10 million, well, they grew nearly 80% year-over-year in fiscal year '24. That was also amazing. Our customers just get so much more value and they can do so much more when they take the full advantage of our Einstein 1 platform. And I want to explain that to you because we have such a rich set of applications that when we're working with all of these employees through the whole company, and also the customers as well, we're filling our platform with the data and the metadata that our customers need to be successful. And there is no other time in the history of our industry that that rich data and metadata together in one place is so important, because that is what you're going to need to drive this artificial intelligence."", ""And you're going to see that next week at Trailhead DX as we show you our copilot for our first time and prompt builder for the first time, and data cloud for the first time, and how it works together so that you can get the insights that you need. Now, this is all possible because we're delivering this Einstein 1 platform. But before I get to that, I just want to make this one last point. For the full year, we delivered $34.9 billion in revenue, up 11% year-over-year, one of the best performances of any enterprise software companies ever. With our continued disciplined approach to margin expansion, non-GAAP operating margin for fiscal '24 was also 30.5%, up 800 basis points year-over-year. We closed fiscal year '24 with operating cash flow reaching $10.2 billion, operating cash flow up 44% year-over-year."", ""Major goal for the company this year, well risked, well done, highest cash flow in our company's history. CRPO, our current remaining performance obligation was $27.6 billion, up 12% and 13% in constant currency year-over-year, fantastic display on CRPO. And total remaining performance obligation ended the fourth quarter at $56.9 billion, an increase of 17% year-over-year. Now let me just say this again, $57 billion in RPO amazing. For fiscal year '25, we expect free cash flow to grow between 23% to 26% for fiscal year '25, that is for fiscal year '25 we expect free cash flow to grow between 23% to 26%. And we're guiding revenue to $38 billion at the high end of our range 9% year-over-year, expecting to deliver fiscal year '25 in subscription and support revenue growth of above 10% year-over-year."", ""In constant currency, we're going to get to that detail in a second. We're committed to delivering non-GAAP operating margin of 32.5%. All told, an unbelievable year, a transformation. From the financial metrics, we're going to get to the technology now. And before I move on, let me just say I've never seen anything like it over the last 25 years as CEO of Salesforce. The pace of change, the focus on productivity, profitability, the speed of innovation, the quality of the management team, people coming back to help us get it done, our boomerangs, our Ohana, thank you to everyone who's made this possible. Just look at where we are now. Salesforce is the world's number one AI CRM. Number one in sales, number one in service, number one in marketing, number one in data cloud."", ""Incredible. And since the start of the pandemic in 2020, we've doubled the size of the company. That's amazing. We doubled the size of the company in scale since the pandemic started, which was about four years ago. That's incredible at our scale. We're the largest enterprise applications company in the world. We passed SAP. That was amazing. That was a huge accomplishment this year. But now we're the third largest enterprise software company in the world and the second largest in Japan. And to all of my Japan, Ohana, [indiscernible] for what you have done with the Japanese market is incredible. We're not stopping. Our management team and our extraordinary employees are focused every day to make our business as strong as it can be. Personally, I've never been more excited about the future of Salesforce."", ""You're about to hear why. It's not just the incredible financial results, not just the unrivaled success of our customers, but it is the incredible door that has opened through artificial intelligence once again and the evolution of our entire technology platform. It's what our engineering and product teams have done in the last 12 months is nothing short of amazing. I am so grateful to their leadership and to David and Srini and to all of your employees. Thank you for what you have done for Salesforce. Your leadership, your vision, your insights, your creativity in rebuilding the platform so quickly, and data cloud for artificial intelligence, for Steve, what you have done for Jujhar, for my whole team, it's incredible. As I said, it's not only a remarkable year of transformation for Salesforce, it's been an amazing year of transformation for entire industry."", ""As I talk to CEOs around the world, they tell me they want three things. You may have heard me say this already, but I'll say it again. One, they want more productivity and they're going to get that productivity through the fundamental augmentation of their employees through artificial intelligence. It's happening and it's empirical. Number two is they want higher value customer relationships, which is also going to happen through this AI and they want higher margins, which we are seeing empirically as well when they use this artificial intelligence and these next generation products. As we look at productivity, as we look at higher value customer relationships, as we look at higher margins, how do our customers get these things? How are they achieving these goals?"", ""It is AI. It is why every CEO and company knows they need to make major investments in AI right now. And I believe this is the single most important moment in the history of the technology industry. It's giving companies an unprecedented level of intelligence that will allow them to connect with their customers in a whole new way. And with our Einstein 1 platform, we're helping out our customers transform for the AI future. Now, many of our customers have been inspired by OpenAI's GPT-4 I have, and cohere I have, and anthropic I have, and inflection I have. And also all the amazing models on hugging face and other AI models. All these things, amazing. And everyone has been wowed by what these AIs can do incredible things and a lot of party tricks, a lot of magical things."", ""And then we also realize there's some other things too. Let's talk about the truth. The truth is that these AI models are all trained on amalgamated public data. You all understand that. You've all seen the New York Times lawsuit of OpenAI or others who are really going to tasks saying, this is all this amalgamated stolen public data, but all these publication (ph) used without permission and unlicensed, but amalgamated into these single consolidated data stores. Now, some of my people even say this is just stolen data, but all this public data has been amalgamated into what they call training sets. And these training sets then get turned into what we call inference, which is how the AI then is able to start to deliver its insights, but there's other things that it's providing besides insights."", ""These AI models, well, they could be considered very confident liars, producing misinformation, hallucinations. Hallucinations are not a feature, okay? And I'm going to get to that point in a second, and I think you all understand it that already because at this point, we all have a high level of experience with AI, don't we? Everyone has had that experience. And there's a danger though, for companies, for enterprises, for our customers, that these are not trusted solutions. And let me point out why that is, especially for companies who are in regulated markets, why this is a big, big deal. These models don't know anything about the company's customer relationships, and in some cases are just making it up. Enterprises need to have the same capabilities that are captivating consumers those amazing things, but they need to have it with trust and they need to have it with security, and it's not easy."", ""Look, we all read the story. Now, it just happened last week. An airline chat-bot. An airline chat Bot prompts by a passenger to book a flight with a 90 day refund window. It turns out the chat bot running on one of these big models, we won't have to use any brand names here. We all know who it was hallucinated the option, it did not exist. We all know what that's like. We've all had the experience. So here's the chat-bot, it hallucinates the option, it's working with the customers, it didn't exist. It did not exist. The airline said, oh, listen, that was just the chat-bot, it gets that way sometime. We're so sorry. You know what? That's just a separate technical entity, a separate legal entity, and the airline, we're not going to be hold liability for that."", ""Well, guess what? That defense did not work in a court of law. The court of law said that that AI chatbot, that made up that incredible new policy for that company, well, that company was going to be held responsible, liable for that policy, that they were going to be held liable for the work of that chatbot, just as they would for a human employee. They were being held liable for a digital employee. The reality for every enterprise is that to deliver trusted AI experiences, you need these three essential components now. You need that compelling user interface. There's no question a natural and effortless experience. And at Salesforce, we have some of the most intuitive user interfaces that deliver insights and intelligence across sales and service and marketing and commerce and industries, many of you are on Slack right now, many of you are on Tableau, many of you are on Mulesoft or one of our other products."", ""Okay. And what else do you need? Number two, you need a world-class AI model. And now we know there's many, many models available. Just go to Hugging Face, which is a company that we're investor in, or look at all the other models. And by the way, not only are there thousands of models right now, but there are tens of thousands, hundreds of thousands of models coming. And all the models that are available today will be obsolete 12 months from now. So we have to have an open, extensible and trusted framework inside Salesforce to be receptacles for these models. That's why Einstein 1 is so important. Then you have to be able to use these AI models, the ones that Salesforce is developing or these public models on Hugging Face or other things or even bring your own model."", ""Customers are even making their own models. Fantastic. Of course, we have great partnerships with OpenAI, with Anthropic, with Cohere, with many other AI models. This is the second key component. One is the UI, the second is the model. All right. Now for those of you who put like for example, Copilot on our phone, any one of the Copilots on the App Store, we have a compelling UI and we know underneath there, there is a compelling model. But third, we also know there's a huge data set there. But here we go. Now we're in the enterprise. In the enterprise, you need deep integration of data and metadata for the AI to understand and deliver the critical insights and intelligence that customers need across their business, across sales, service, marketing, commerce, whatever it is, that deep integration of the data and metadata, that's not so easy."", ""That's not just some amalgamated stolen public data set in the enterprise, that deep integration of data and metadata, oh, that's what Salesforce does. We are a deep integration of data and metadata. That is why it's very, very exciting. Yeah, I like to say, and I love NVIDIA, by the way. And what Jensen has done is amazing. And they are delivering very much in the era of the gold rush, the Levis jeans to the gold miners. But we all know where the gold is, the data. The gold is the data. And that's why we're so excited about Salesforce because we are one of the very largest repositories of enterprise data and metadata in the world for our customers. And customers are just starting to realize this right now and they try to stitch together a variety of AI tools and Copilots, and this and that, and whatever."", ""I've had so many funny conversations with so many customers who come to me that they're experts in AI and they're this, and then I just say to them, but how are you going to deliver this experience? And then finally realize, oh, I need the deep integration with the data and the metadata. The reason why the metadata is so important is because it describes the data. That's why so many companies are turning to Salesforce for their AI transformation. Only Salesforce offers these critical layers of AI for our customers. The UI, the model and the deep integration of the data and the metadata and make the AI smart and intelligent and insightful and without the hallucinations and without all these -- all the other problems. For more than two decades, we've been trusted with our customers' data and metadata and we have a lot of it and a lot of you are our customers, so you'll understand what I'm saying."", ""But many of our customers also have islands and thousands of systems of trap data. Now what I'm going to say is very simple. Trap data is all over the enterprise. Now what trap data can be is you might be using a great company like Snowflake, and I love Snowflake or Databricks or Microsoft or you might be using Amazon system or even something like Google. What these things -- BigQuery, all these various databases. But put your hand up if you're using Snowflake every day. Put your hand up if you're using one of these other systems. Put your hand up if you're using Salesforce sales cloud, service cloud, Tableau, Slack. We need to be able to, through our zero copy, automatically integrate into our Data Cloud, all of those systems and then seamlessly provide that data back into these amazing tools."", ""And that is what we are doing because so many of our customers have islands of trapped data in all of these systems. But this AI is not going to work because it needs to have this seamless amalgamated data experience of data and metadata. And that's why our Data Cloud is like a rocket ship. The entire AI revolution is built on this foundation of data and it's why we're so excited about this incredible Data cloud. It's now deeply integrated into all of our apps, into our entire platform. It's self-service for all of our customers to turn on. It is our fastest-growing product ever. It's our total focus for fiscal year '25 with Salesforce Data Cloud. Salesforce can unlock this trap data and bring together all of their business and customer data into one place for AI all while keeping their data safe and secure and it's all running inside our Einstein Trust Layer and we've deployed it to all of our customers."", ""We unleashed now the Copilot as well to all of our customers deeply built on our pilot, on our data and metadata. And while other copilots just sit and spin because they can't figure out what the data means and if you haven't seen the demonstrations, you just see these Copilots spin. But when they use Salesforce, it all of a sudden becomes intelligent. And that is the core of the Einstein 1 platform. It's all of our apps, all of our AI capabilities, all of the customer data in one deeply integrated trusted metadata platform. And that's why we're seeing incredible demand for Data Cloud. Data Cloud brings it all together and we are so blessed to have Data Cloud in our company. And it's also why in Q4 25% of our deals already over $1 million have included Data Cloud."", ""And we've recently added over 1,000 new customers to Data Cloud. We've never seen traction like this of a new product because you can just easily turn on the Data Cloud and it adds huge value to Sales Cloud, it adds huge value to Service Cloud, to Marketing Cloud, to the CDP. You've all seen the Gartner Magic quadrant that got published last week about the Data Cloud. Or if you haven't go to my Twitter feed and you'll see how amazing that MQ is. And it's the fastest-growing organic product in the history of Salesforce. This last quarter, more than 7 trillion records, 7 trillion records were ingested into Data Cloud, unbelievable. 7 trillion records ingested in Data Cloud with over 1 trillion activations driving customer engagement, lighting up all of those sales service marketing cloud users, all the platform, Tableau, it's all integrated into Data Cloud."", ""And because Data Cloud and all of Einstein 1 is built on our metadata framework, as I just described, every customer app can securely access and understand the data and use any model, use any UI workflow, integrate with the platform. That means less complexity, more flexibility, faster innovation. But also we want to say goodbye to these hallucinations. We want to say goodbye to all of these crazy experiences that you're having with these bots that don't know what they're doing because they have no data or metadata, okay? Or the data that they have metadata is like productivity data, or like the highest level data that's not deeply integrated data. So only Salesforce can do this. Only Salesforce has this vision of this kind of platform and only has -- we've been working on this for 25 years and we are not done."", ""We are just starting because let me tell you now a story of how we're delivering a high-quality trusted AI for our customers. We all know the HR and payroll leader ADP and their incredible new CEO, Maria Black, amazing. ADP has been a great Sales Cloud customer for two decades. They've used Einstein for years. They were one of the first customers we ever have. We're so grateful to ADP, amazing. And work with so many of their great CEOs over the decades. And the company wanted to transform now customer service with AI to give their agents real time insights next best actions, auto generated case summaries, well, I have to say to you, it was a little bit embarrassing, Salesforce was not number one on their list. And I said to them, how can that be?"", ""We're the number one Service Cloud. We're number one in the MQ, we're number one in this. We're number one merchant. No, we're going to go evaluate this. We're going to look at all the different solutions. We're going to look at all the new AI models. We think we're just going to hook this model up to this and we're going to do that. And it sounded like a big Rube Goldberg invention. What was going to happen there? And so we had to go in and we just wanted to partner with them and say, all right, show us what you want to do. We're going to work with you. We're going to be trusted partners, let's go. But like a lot of our customers moving to AI, ADP realized it didn't have a comprehensive deeply integrated platform of data and metadata that could bring together all of this into a single source of truth."", ""And then you get the incredible customer service, then you get the results that you're looking for. And it's deeply integrated with their sales systems, with marketing and custom applications. And ADP discovered only Salesforce can do this. We were able to show ADP how we could unlock trap data with Data Cloud, zero copy, drive intelligence, productivity, efficiency for their sales team with Einstein to levels unimagined just a year ago. We're now incredibly excited to work with all of our customers to take their AI to the next level with Einstein Copilot, which is going live tomorrow. Einstein Copilot, which if you haven't seen it, and if you haven't, please come to Trailhead DX next week. This is the first conversational AI assistant for the enterprise that's truly trusted."", ""It's amazing. It can answer questions. It can summarize. It can create new content, dynamically automate tasks behalf of the user from this single consistent user experience embedded directly within our platform. But let me tell you the one thing that it can do that's more important than all of that. It is able to read across all the data and metadata in our platform to get that insight instantly. And you're going to see that. So the sales rep might ask the Einstein Copilot what lead I should focus on or what is the most important thing I need to do with this opportunity? And it may say, you need to resolve this customer's -- customer case because this escalation has been around for a week. Or you better go and answer that lead that came in on the marketing cloud before if you want to move this opportunity forward."", ""Because it's reading across the entire data set, that is something that individual users cannot do but the copilot can do with access to customer data and the metadata in Salesforce, including all this real time data and website engagement and the ability to read through the data set. That's why Einstein Copilot has all the context to understand the question and surface believe that has the highest value and likelihood to convert. And it can also instantly generate the action plan with the best steps to close the deal, such as suggesting optimal meeting times on the lead contacts, known preferences, even drafting the email. If you haven't seen the video that I put on my Twitter feed last night, there's a five minute video that goes through all of these incredible things that it's able to do."", ""There's never been an enterprise AI capability quite like it. It's amazing. All of us can understand the tasks that the Copilot is performing. And I bet a lot of people, even on this call, that a lot of other companies might say they can do this. But I assure you, without the deep integration of the data and the metadata across the entire platform, with the Copilot's deep integration of that data, they cannot do it. They cannot do it. I assure you they cannot because they don't have the data and the metadata, which is so critical to making an AI assistant so successful. And I encourage you to try the demos yourself to put our Copilot up against any other copilot. Because I'll tell you that I've seen enterprise Copilots from these other companies in actions and they just spin and spin and spin."", ""And some have a different copilot for every app, some with different capabilities, restrictions grounding this Wizzywig builders on whatever. It's very cute. Very nice. Exciting. It's really cool for the first minute and then you realize, wait a minute, what data is available in this Copilot? Only a conversational UI can start to understand all these things if it has this access. Only after a conversational UI for canned queries or don't understand the customers to customize the Copilot, those are -- none of these things are going to work. I've used those Copilots from the competitors. I have not seen them work yet. Okay, the thinking icon, the spinning, it goes on and on and on and on. Einstein Copilot, you're going to see. You're going to have your hands on it."", ""Now it's been released into the wild to our customers, to all of you, this is fundamentally different kind of AI. Just like Einstein was a different AI, which became the democratization of AI, which is why Einstein does a trillion transactions a week. Einstein's the only Copilot with the ability to truly understand what's going on with your customer relationships. It's one conversational AI assistant deeply connected to trusted customer data and metadata. It's one integrated system for all of our customers across any role or industry. And it's why we call it Einstein 1. It's one platform, one integrated system. That is what you need to get AI to work. Next week, at our Trailhead DX conference in San Francisco, I hope you're all coming, it's going to be amazing."", ""On March 6 and 7, you're going to see how we're bringing even more AI innovation to our customers. So be prepared to be amazed by Einstein Copilot builder, prompt builder, model builder, and so much more that we're doing to help our customers, make every employee more productive and transform every customer experience. And I hope you're going to join us in person or you can join us online at Salesforce Plus. And with closing, I just want to thank all of you once again for everything that you've done for us for the last year. We're so grateful to each and every one of you and to our entire management team, all our Ohana and all of our customers as well. We're so grateful as we look forward now to our 25th anniversary in March 8, I've never been more excited."", ""You can hear why? Not just the fundamental transformation of the company, but also the fundamental transformation of the product line and the product vision as we move into this incredible new, intelligent world that we're all seeing with AI. So thank you. I'm now turning over to Brian, who was employee number 13, our Chief Operating Officer. He's done a phenomenal job this year. Without him and without Amy, without our whole management team, it would not be possible. I just want to thank again everyone who's been a huge part of everything. And I'll turn it over to you. Brian, here we go."", ""Brian Millham: Well, thank you Marc. I really appreciate it. I couldn't be more proud to be part of Salesforce the past 25 years, especially this past year as we took on a pivotal business transformation while delivering incredible innovation for our customers and returns for our shareholders. Our continued focus on operational excellence, high performance and new growth initiatives helped deliver strong results in the fiscal year and remains our focus going forward. At FY ‘24, we've laid the foundation for success through strategic restructuring, streamlining our go-to-market approach, deeper inspection and continued operational excellence. As part of our transformation, we also refined and scaled our big deal motion and introduced new product bundles to give our customers comprehensive solutions on a unified, trusted platform."", ""And we're unlocking customer spend with new channels like AWS Marketplace and driving sea level relevance through strategic collaboration with McKinsey. The adjustments we made are paying off. As Marc mentioned, our deals greater than $10 million in FY ‘24 grew substantially 78% year-over-year and we closed 86,000 multi-cloud deals. Our pricing and packaging strategy is driving higher sales and delivering more value for companies of all sizes in the industries. Since launching in April, we've added 3,000 new logos through self-service with Salesforce starter, a solution for our small businesses that include sales, service and marketing. With AI and Data Cloud built in. We're excited by the momentum we're seeing in UE plus bundle, which is now called Einstein 1 edition."", ""It's providing substantial returns for our customers and for Salesforce. In fact, we continue to see significant average sales price uplift from existing customers who upgrade to Einstein 1 edition. It's also attracting new customers to Salesforce. 15% of the companies that purchased our Einstein 1 edition and FY 24 were net new logos. As you heard from Mark, with our Einstein one platform including Data Cloud and Einstein Copilot, we're rapidly infusing conversational AI across our entire product portfolio. Einstein is a huge differentiator for us as the industry transforms -- excuse me, in this AI revolution. It's the fastest and safest way to unlock an organization's data to create better customer experiences, augment employees with AI, and drive productivity and improve margins and profitability."", ""Every AI strategy starts with data. As Marc said, Data Cloud has strong momentum. Data Cloud is approaching $400 million in ARR, growing at nearly 90% year-over-year. And in Q4, 25% of our deals greater than $1 million, included Data Cloud. Customers like Xerox and London Stock Exchange and Dyken turned to Data Cloud in Q4 to build their trusted data foundations and unlock their trap data within Salesforce. And we're excited about our future, we just were named, as Mark mentioned, the leader in the inaugural February 2024 Gartner Magic Quadrant for customer data platforms. I met with dozen a CEOs and business leaders over the past few months, and they're all focused on fueling growth and strengthening customer relationships within their current budgets and workforce, and they see AI as the tool to augment their people and drive more productivity."", ""Companies like ADP and Intel, McLaren and Sonos are investing in Einstein 1 to become AI first organizations. In FY24, we closed 1,300 Einstein deals as more customers are leveraging our generative and predictive AI capabilities. We're just at the beginning of a new innovation cycle that will spark a massive software buying cycle over the coming years, and Salesforce is leading the way. We continue to see strong demand for our data products as customers lay the foundation for AI. Specifically, Mulesoft is helping companies such as Rosignal and TK Elevator in North America bring together their data from any source, a critical step to prepare for AI. Mulesoft was in eight of our top ten deals in the quarter and executed a record 319 billion workflows, automated workflows every month, up 100% year over-year. Tableau was in 20 of our top 25 deals in the quarter and is fully integrated to Data Cloud."", ""Wins in the quarter include customers like IHG, Heathrow Airport and Brazilian fintech stone. Tableau Pulse, a phenomenal new product that's just been released, generally available last week, actually already has 2,000 customers. Powered by Data Cloud and Einstein, Tableau Pulse automatically delivers personalized AI powered insights in both a natural language and visual format. We're also excited about the innovation coming from Slack, which was included in nearly half of our top 50 deals in the quarter. We just launched Slack AI with features like AI search channel recaps and thread summaries to meet the enormous demand for embedded AI in the flow of work from customers like Australian Post and OpenAI. It's amazing to see what Slack has accomplished in a decade and frankly it's just the beginning."", 'We have a great vision for the future of Slack as a conversational interface for any application. Our specialized industry products continue to fuel our growth, chosen in the quarter by customers like Japan Post Insurance, TPG Telecom and USDA. Collectively, our industry businesses finished the year at $4.8 billion ARR, up more than 20% year-over-year. We saw strong growth internationally with wins at Volvo and Genpac, Hitachi and Bochikario. India continues to be a bright spot for us, growing new business at 35% year-over year and we continue to invest in the region to meet the needs of customers including Bajaj finance. I had the great opportunity to meet with their CEO Rajiv Jane in January and a top priority for him was using Einstein to deliver predictive and generative AI across their entire lending business which they run on Salesforce.', ""In Q4, Bajaj became the second largest Data Cloud customer globally, building their AI foundation on the Einstein 1 platform. I want to close by acknowledging that our success is only possible because our phenomenal employees, incredible partners, trailblazers, shareholders and amazing customers who have trusted us for 25 years. As we proved in FY 24, when we focus on something as a company we deliver results. And FY25 that focus is on profitable growth. And with that, I'll turn it over to you Amy"", ""Amy Weaver: Great. Thanks, Brian. Let me join Marc and Brian on saying what a year it has been for Salesforce. At this time last year we laid out our accelerated transformation plan and I am incredibly proud of the significant progress we made this year against that plan. Throughout fiscal 2024 we delivered, we've on increasing profitability, revenue, productivity and operational excellence. Q4 represents another quarter of strong execution and continued discipline across the business. Now let's turn to the results. For the fourth quarter, revenue was 9.3 billion, up 11% year-over-year and 10% in constant currency. The growth was primarily driven by resilient sales and service performance as well as strength in Yolsoft and Tableau."", ""And for the full year revenue was 34.9 billion, up 11% year-over-year in both nominal and constant currency. From a geographic perspective, in Q4, the Americas revenue grew 9%, EMEA grew 14% or 11% in constant currency, and APAC grew 14% or 19% in constant currency. We saw strong new business growth in LatAm, India and Canada, while parts of EMEA remained constrained. From an industry perspective, in Q4, public sector and travel transportation and hospitality both performed well, while retail and consumer goods and high tech were generally more measured. Our multicloud momentum also continued. In Q4, eight of our top 10 deals included six or more clouds, and more than half of our top 100 wins included six or more clouds. As you've already heard, AI starts with data and we are seeing strong momentum in Data Cloud."", 'In Q4, more than half of our top 25 wins included Data Cloud. Q4 revenue attrition ended the quarter at slightly above 8%, generally in line with recent quarters. In Q4, our non-GAAP operating margin was 31.4%, up 220 basis points year-over-year. And for the full year, in line with our guidance, we delivered non-GAAP operating margin of 30.5%, up 800 basis points year-over-year and GAAP operating margin ended the year at 14.4%, up 1110 basis points year-over-year. Q4 operating cash flow was $3.4 billion, up 22% year-over-year. Q4 free cash flow was $3.3 billion, up 27% year-over-year. And for the full year, operating cash flow was a record $10.2 billion, up 44% year-over-year. Full year free cash flow was $9.5 billion, up 50% year-over-year.', ""Now turning to remaining performance obligation, RPO, which represents all future revenue under contract, ended Q4 at an incredible $56 billion, up 17% year-over-year. Current remaining performance obligation, or CRPO, ended at $27.6 billion, up 12% year-over-year and 13% in constant currency, particularly driven by strong execution on early renewals. We also benefited from new business performance and timing of license revenue from Mulesoft and Tableau. As expected, this was partially offset by a 1 point headwind from professional services, which we had noted last quarter. Now let's turn to guidance. Starting with full fiscal year '25. On revenue, we expect $37.7 billion to $38 billion, growth of 8% to 9% year-over-year. A few items to note on our revenue guide."", ""Our expectations incorporate a $100 million FX headwind year-over-year or a 30 basis points impact. We also expect our professional services business to remain under pressure in FY25 and expect it will be a headwind to revenue. Within our revenue guidance, subscription and support revenue growth is expected to be slightly above 10% year-over-year in constant currency. Now, as a reminder, our top line expectations include the impact from the measured buying environment that began back in fiscal year '23. This takes time to flow through our subscription revenue stream due to the like effect of bookings to revenue recognition. That said, we continue to execute well in the measured buying environment. Over the past two quarters, I'm happy to say that we've seen improved bookings growth."", ""And as you heard from Marc, we're incredibly well-positioned to build on our success and bring our customers into this new AI era. Now, turning to attrition. Starting in fiscal '25, we are including Slack invoice in the metric. Despite expecting a modest headwind, we expect attrition to remain consistent at slightly above 8%. On margins, we continue to drive operational excellence, productivity and efficiency. And for fiscal year '25, we expect a non-GAAP operating margin of 32.5% representing a 200 basis point improvement year-over-year, while still making key investments in growth opportunities, notably AI, data and our core businesses. Stock-based compensation is expected to be below 8% as a percent of revenue as we continue to take a disciplined approach to our equity-based programs."", ""As a result, for the fiscal year '25, I am pleased that our GAAP operating margin guidance for the first time is expected to surpass 20% at 20.4%, representing a 600 basis point improvement year-over-year. We expect fiscal year '25 GAAP diluted EPS $6.07 to $6.15. Non-GAAP diluted EPS is expected to be $9.68 to $9.76. As a result of our focus on profitable growth and continued transformation, we are seeing a market improvement in our cash flow outcomes. We expect fiscal year '25 operating cash flow growth of approximately 21% to 24%, which includes a 10 point year-over-year headwind from cash taxes. CapEx for the fiscal year is expected to be slightly below 2% of revenue. This results in free cash flow growth of approximately 23% to 26% for the fiscal year."", 'Now to guidance for Q1. On revenue, we expect $9.12 billion to $9.17 billion, up 11% year-over-year in nominal and 12% in constant currency. This includes a tailwind from the timing of license revenue in Mulesoft and Tableau. Additionally, Q1 has a one point benefit from an extra day of revenue recognition given the leap year, which has no impact on our full year revenue or CRPO. CRPO growth for Q1 is expected to be 11% year-over-year in nominal and 12% in constant currency. For Q1, we expect GAAP EPS of $1.42 to $1.44 and non-GAAP EPS of $2.37 to $2.39. Now to capital return. We are deeply committed to driving free cash flow and return to our shareholders while investing in new organic growth initiatives. In Q4, we returned $1.7 billion in the form of share repurchases, bringing the total returns in FY24 to $7.7 billion, or more than 80% of fiscal year free cash flow, which more than fully offset dilution from our stock-based compensation.', ""Since the inception of our repurchase program, we have now returned $11.7 billion to shareholders with an average purchase price of $182 per share. And I'm incredibly excited to announce our first ever dividend. We are enhancing our capital return strategy reflective of the confidence we have in the future of our business and our ability to drive long term cash flow. Our Board has approved the initiation of a quarterly dividend starting at $0.40, more details of this dividend are available in our press release. Additionally, the Board has approved a $10 billion increase to our share repurchase plan, bringing the total authorization to $30 billion. Based on our progress to date, the remaining balance in the program is approximately $18 billion."", ""In closing, I want to echo Marc and Brian, and this has been an extraordinary year. I'm very proud of the progress we have made throughout the company. We are executing with discipline while also investing for our future. I want to personally thank our employees who have worked so hard this past year and thank our shareholders for their continued support over this past transformational year.

TCI Fund Management, headed by billionaire Christopher Hohn, led the group with $12.9 billion in returns after fees. On average, the top 20 managers achieved a 10.5% gain in 2023, surpassing the industry's overall return of 6.4%. Multi-strategy hedge funds like Citadel, Millennium Management, and D. E. Shaw, known for using leverage, were the top three funds by lifetime gains. Despite representing only 4.6% of the industry's assets, these three firms generated 38.3% of the industry's returns over the past three years. Citadel, with $74 billion in gains since 1990, maintained its leading position in 2023, returning 15.3%, while also deciding to return approximately $7 billion to investors. Pershing Square, led by William Ackman, re-entered the rankings for the first time since 2015, securing the 20th position with $18.8 billion in returns since 2004, and achieving a return of 26.7% in 2023, outperforming the broader stock market. On the other hand, Bridgewater Associates and Caxton Associates were the only firms among the top 20 that posted losses. The strong performance in 2023 followed a challenging 2022 marked by market turbulence due to the war in Ukraine and Federal Reserve interest rate hikes.

In a statement to Financial Times, Amiee said:\xa0', '“You could argue that, since shorting is such a challenging sub-strategy, keeping things long-biased and having a concentrated portfolio of high quality positions has been the way to go.”', 'The robust performance of top financiers correlates with the overall stock market rally in 2023, particularly benefiting hedge funds that focus on specific stock picks.

However, concerns are rising on Wall Street about the concentration of investments in these same companies.

Investors, seeking double-digit returns in 2024, are interested in credit, global macro, commodity, and equity long/short strategies.

Cramer said first the bears warned everyone about the inflationary cycle after the pandemic, then they “hated” the market amid the regional banking crisis, upping their calls for a hard landing following the Fed’s rate hikes.', 'Jim Cramer said all along these bears “failed to celebrate the market’s incredible victories” and they “ignored” the “end of high inflation.”', 'Jim Cramer also said that initially the market bears complained about the concentration of market gains in the Magnificent Seven group of stocks, which include companies like \xa0Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL), NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) and Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT), but later ignored when the gains started to “bifurcate” to the broader market including small-cap and mid-cap stocks which Cramer believes are still “cheap.”', '“What the heck is wrong with these people,” Cramer said about market skeptics.', 'Jim Cramer also said that while market doubters called AI a bubble, they ignored crypto which Cramer believes was an “obvious bubble.” Cramer said many believe crypto is a hedge against inflation but when inflation was very high crypto performed “horribly.”', 'Nonetheless Cramer admitted that crypto’s “relative worth” against the US dollar is “palpable” and it “makes sense” that people are investing in crypto ETFs to hedge against inflation.', 'Jim Cramer also talked about AI and how some people are calling it a bubble. Cramer said while there are some companies in the industry that are “over inflated” not all AI companies are bubbles. Cramer reiterated his bullish take on NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) and said the stock is undervalued. Cramer said you have to have a historical context to understand and analyze Nvidia. He said that last year NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) stock was apparently overvalued based on the Wall Street’s earnings estimates. Cramer said the company’s 2024 earnings estimates set by Wall Street analysts are still low and that’s why he believes the stock has more room to run.', '“It is undisputed that NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) is the king of AI,” Cramer said.', 'In the end, Cramer recommended investors to build up their cash piles and be ready to buy when there’s a pullback.', 'Methodology', ""For this article we watched the latest 'Lightning Round' segments of Jim Cramer's recent programs and picked 11 stocks he recommended investors.

Financial results for our Emerging Businesses Group are anticipated to follow a typical seasonal pattern with some slowing of activity in Q2.', 'Looking beyond the second quarter, which is CMC’s seasonally slowest period, we expect robust spring and summer construction activity driven by the increased impact of rising infrastructure investment, which should support an already healthy demand backdrop. Both the North America Steel Group and the Emerging Businesses Group should benefit from anticipated strong activity levels. Regarding the Europe Steel Group, supply-side adjustments and the impact of increasing levels of residential and infrastructure construction should drive sequential improvement in financial results beginning with the spring construction season.""', 'Read the full earnings call transcript here.', 'In addition to Commercial Metals, Jim Cramer is also bullish on \xa0Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL), NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) and Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT).', '\xa0', 'Click to continue reading and see\xa0Jim Cramer’s Latest Lightning Round: 5\xa0Stock Recommendations.', '\xa0', 'Suggested Articles:', 'Jim Cramer’s 11 Latest Stock Picks', 'Jim Cramer Says You Should Stay Away from These 10 Stocks', 'Jim Cramer is Bearish on These 12 Stocks', 'Disclosure.\xa0None.\xa0Jim Cramer’s Latest Lightning Round: 11 Stock Recommendations\xa0was initially published on Insider Monkey.']"

Training massive large-language models and running them requires gargantuan computing capacity. Nvidia's data center GPUs are the gold standard in the AI industry, and they're being scooped up by cloud giants and AI start-ups alike."", ""Nvidia's revenue more than tripled in its most recent quarter thanks to incredible demand for its AI-centric GPUs, while adjusted earnings per share rose by nearly a factor of six. Nvidia's market capitalization has surged to over $2 trillion, making it one of the most valuable companies in the world."", ""While Nvidia is riding high right now, competition is almost guaranteed to eat away at the company's AI market share. Advanced Micro Devices is now putting up a fight with its own high-powered AI chips, and major tech and cloud computing companies are increasingly designing custom AI chips optimized for their data centers."", 'Amazon has developed multiple AI chips: Inferentia for AI inference and Trainium for AI training.', ""Alphabet's Google is on the fifth generation of its tensor processing unit, or TPU, with the company rolling out a version optimized for AI large models late last year."", 'Meta is reportedly working on a custom AI chip to help power its massive AI ambitions.', ""Microsoft unveiled its custom Maia 100 AI chip for its Azure cloud platform last year. It will initially be used to power the company's AI services, including Copilot and the OpenAI services running on Azure."", ""While these mega-companies are still buying plenty of Nvidia's GPUs, options for training and running AI models are expanding. Nvidia's utter dominance of the AI chip market is almost certain to erode as time goes on."", ""Designing an AI chip is something that any large tech company with a big budget is capable of doing. Manufacturing those chips is another story. Today, there's only one viable option for manufacturing AI chips using the most advanced process. TSMC is the foundry market leader, and it has a significant technological lead over its competitors."", 'This situation is set to change in 2025 as Intel (NASDAQ: INTC) enters the foundry market in earnest. The chip giant has been executing its plan to roll out five new process nodes in four years, with the final node expected to overtake TSMC technologically. The Intel 18A process should be ready for volume production next year, and Intel has already snagged some important customers.', ""Intel has secured $15 billion of orders for its foundry business so far, spanning not only Intel 18A but also other nodes as well as advanced packaging services. Nvidia is reportedly planning to use Intel for some of its advanced packaging needs, although that rumor hasn't been confirmed. A deal with Microsoft to use Intel 18A for an undisclosed future chip has been confirmed, representing a massive win for Intel's fledgling foundry business."", 'Beyond Intel 18A, Intel has two additional processes on its roadmap meant to cement its manufacturing lead. Intel 14A is set to arrive in 2026, and Intel 10A will follow in 2027. Volume production of both processes will take time to ramp up following their introductions.', ""The foundry market is expected to more than double by 2032 to surpass $230 billion. Intel's market share rounds down to zero today, but if it succeeds in regaining its manufacturing edge and ramping up the capacity of its leading nodes, the company can rapidly grow that market share over the next decade."", ""Intel is valued at less than $200 billion today, with the stock still down significantly from its pandemic-era high. While Intel's core PC and server CPU businesses will remain key parts of the company, the foundry business has by far the best long-term growth potential."", ""Importantly, Intel's foundry can succeed regardless of how the semiconductor and AI industries evolve. Do GPUs remain the dominant method to train and run AI models? Intel could potentially manufacture them. Do custom AI chips proliferate? Intel could manufacture those as well. What if demand for AI chips falls short of forecasts? Intel can manufacture other types of chips destined for the data center, smartphones, PCs, and other devices."", ""While Nvidia is the AI darling today, it faces an onslaught of looming competition. That onslaught is good news for the foundry industry, and it's particularly good news for Intel as it aims to grow into the world's second-largest foundry by 2030."", 'Should you invest $1,000 in Intel right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Intel, consider this:', 'The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\xa010 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Intel wasn’t one of them.

So, where does the split occur?', ""Microsoft and Apple are at the top of the list of those I'm passing on. Microsoft is excelling as a business, but the stock has gotten a bit pricey. Tipping the scales at 35 times forward earnings, Microsoft is one of the most expensive of the group that is optimized for profits."", ""Apple has struggled recently as its revenue shrank for four straight quarters before growing again in its latest quarter, but only by 2%.Apple's woes are expected to continue, as Wall Street analysts project 1.3% sales growth this fiscal year and 6.5% next year."", 'These two are at the bottom of my list, but the next stock is teetering on a buy.', ""Nvidia has been the best performer by far of the group, and there is a lot of hype built up in the stock. But that's for good reason. The demand for Nvidia's graphics processing units (GPUs) has been off the charts, as highlighted by Nvidia's 265% year-over-year revenue growth in Q4 of fiscal year 2024. The stock is actually cheaper than Microsoft (33 times forward earnings), making it a potential buy."", ""But Nvidia isn't as tantalizing as the other four."", 'That leaves Amazon, Alphabet, Tesla, and Meta Platforms remaining as buys. All of these have different reasons to buy.\xa0For Amazon, its margins have been increasing thanks to the rise of its service divisions.', 'This has allowed its profits to climb dramatically alongside its rising revenue. Despite this success, it trades at its lowest price-to-sales ratio since 2020. This makes me confident that the best days are still ahead of Amazon.', ""Alphabet has had its fair share of stumbles in its artificial intelligence (AI) rollout, which hasn't helped the stock. But it's still a dominant power in advertising and cloud computing, which helped it grow its revenue by 13% in Q4. However, Alphabet is the cheapest stock on this list, trading at 20.3 times forward earnings."", ""That's cheaper than the 20.4 times forward earnings the S&P 500 trades at, making Alphabet a cheaper stock than the broader market. That's an absolute bargain, making it a fantastic buy."", ""Meta Platforms has turned its business around after struggling in late 2022. Like Alphabet, its advertising wing has turned itself around, driving revenue growth of 25% in Q4. Wall Street analysts project another strong 2024, projecting 17% revenue growth. With the stock trading at 25 times forward earnings, it's not the cheapest, but it's still a solid buy at that price point."", 'Lastly is Tesla, which I may consider swapping with Nvidia. Tesla has been whacked since 2024 began, falling nearly 20%.', ""Some of this concern comes from falling margins and slowing revenue growth. While this is a fair assessment, it also ignores some of the interest rate headwinds buyers are experiencing. Still, management was clear in the conference call that they're between growth waves, so this year may be tough."", ""But if you take the long-term view, Tesla's stock is the cheapest it has been in a year, although, at 63 times forward earnings, it's still pricey. If you've missed the Tesla boat, now might be a good time to hop in."", ""While the Magnificent Seven stocks won't have the same performance they had in 2023 going forward, some are still strong buys and have market-beating potential."", 'Should you invest $1,000 in Meta Platforms right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Meta Platforms, consider this:', 'The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\xa010 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Meta Platforms wasn’t one of them.

The myriad applications the technology presents seem to evolve by the day. At the forefront of the AI revolution is semiconductor manufacturer Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA).', 'Nvidia is best known for its graphics processing units (GPUs) -- specialized chips used in accelerated computing and generative AI applications, such as machine learning and natural language processing.', ""Nvidia's products have been in high demand over the last year as AI became a more prominent fixture in IT budgets. For the 12 months ended Jan. 28, Nvidia generated $27 billion in free cash flow -- a more than sevenfold increase compared to the prior year."", ""The company is aggressively deploying its capital, and a new investment in robotics start-up Figure AI is Nvidia's latest move in its calculated chess game to outmaneuver the competition. Let's break down what Figure AI does and why Nvidia may be so keen to get involved in the emerging robotics market."", 'Figure AI is a start-up that is developing humanoid robots. The company believes robotics will play a crucial role in automating everyday life. For example, robotics has the potential not only to disrupt the labor market but also to assist people in their homes with mundane tasks.', ""Last week, reports broke that Figure AI raised $675 million in venture capital (VC)\xa0funding at a $2.6 billion valuation. If achieving unicorn status wasn't impressive enough, the company's backers are equally impressive. Participants in the fundraising included Microsoft, Jeff Bezos, Cathie Wood's Ark Invest, OpenAI, and Nvidia."", ""Jeff Bezos, Nvidia, OpenAI, Microsoft, & Amazon are backing 'Figure AI', a start-up developing human-like robots, is raising $675M, valuing the company at ~$2B Bezos contributes $100M, Microsoft $95M, with Nvidia and Amazon each investing $50M. @elonmuskpic.twitter.com/udATNvaQvS"", '-- Wall St Engine (@wallstengine) February 23, 2024', ""I'll concede that the idea of humanoid robots sits somewhere between The Jetsons and a sci-fi horror movie. But all jokes aside, Wall Street sees massive potential for this pocket of the AI market."", 'Goldman Sachs estimates that the total addressable market for humanoid robots could be $38 billion by 2035. To put this into context, just a year ago, the bank estimated that the market size was $6 billion. Goldman cited faster-than-anticipated progress in large language models (LLM) and accelerated investments in AI as reasoning for the more bullish forecast.', ""But Goldman isn't the only one that sees multibillion-dollar potential here. On Figure AI's website, the company outlines that robots could disrupt the labor force in a meaningful way -- from industries including manufacturing, logistics, warehousing, and retail. As robots help mitigate labor shortages, it could result in an enormous paradigm shift in the workforce by lowering the cost of goods and services."", ""I see a few reasons Nvidia may be interested in partnering with Figure AI. First, Nvidia's chips and its under-the-radar software business could play a crucial role in the further development of Figure AI bots."", ""But a more subtle reason for Nvidia's participation in the fundraise could be to simply acquire some exposure to an already established market. Humanoid robots are being developed by a host of companies -- you might just not realize it."", 'Most prominently, Tesla has been teasing investors with a robot called Optimus, which it plans to use across its gigafactories and sell to consumers and businesses more broadly in the long term. And right behind Tesla is Boston Dynamics, the developer of the canine robot BigDog and humanoid bot Atlas.', 'Lastly, while Amazon and Alibaba currently leverage less-humanlike robots for their warehouses, the broader idea is that this technology has led to incredible efficiencies as it relates to shipping and labor costs. As investment in AI continues to build momentum, I would not be surprised to see companies in all different industries worldwide begin to integrate humanoid robotics into everyday operations.', 'The investment in Figure AI comes at the heels of another investment by Nvidia, this one in voice-recognition software developer SoundHound AI. While news of these deals is not a reason alone to buy Nvidia stock, it is fun to speculate what they could represent in the long run.', 'I see the investment in Nvidia as an important move for the company as it seeks to move beyond GPUs. While its chip business will likely remain the bread and butter for the next few years, eventually, the competitive landscape will heat up, and Nvidia will need to demonstrate that it has other products and services it can market.', ""I am excited to see where Nvidia can go in the long run, given the potential of humanoid robotics, the many different industries it could disrupt globally, and the company's potential to act as one of the primary engines powering this new technology."", 'Should you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:', 'The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\xa010 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

The regimen is used in about half of all abortions in the U.S., and testing, as well as decades of use, have shown it to be safe and effective\xa0for terminating pregnancies.\xa0The drug has historically been obtained through prescriptions by a doctor or clinic, though in 2016 the FDA expanded access by allowing online prescriptions and mail orders.', 'Since last year, though, the drug’s availability has been threatened. A challenge from the conservative group Alliance for Hippocratic Medicine has worked its way through the legal system, eventually leading to an appeals court decision last August restricting access.

Media reports about rating changes by these brokerage-firm-employed (or sell-side) analysts often influence a stock's price, but are they really important?"", ""Let's take a look at what these Wall Street heavyweights have to say about Synopsys (SNPS) before we discuss the reliability of brokerage recommendations and how to use them to your advantage."", 'Synopsys currently has an average brokerage recommendation (ABR) of 1.20, on a scale of 1 to 5 (Strong Buy to Strong Sell), calculated based on the actual recommendations (Buy, Hold, Sell, etc.) made by 15 brokerage firms. An ABR of 1.20 approximates between Strong Buy and Buy.', 'Of the 15 recommendations that derive the current ABR, 13 are Strong Buy and one is Buy. Strong Buy and Buy respectively account for 86.7% and 6.7% of all recommendations.', 'Brokerage Recommendation Trends for SNPS', 'Check price target & stock forecast for Synopsys here>>>While the ABR calls for buying Synopsys, it may not be wise to make an investment decision solely based on this information. Several studies have shown limited to no success of brokerage recommendations in guiding investors to pick stocks with the best price increase potential.', 'Do you wonder why? As a result of the vested interest of brokerage firms in a stock they cover, their analysts tend to rate it with a strong positive bias. According to our research, brokerage firms assign five ""Strong Buy"" recommendations for every ""Strong Sell"" recommendation.', ""In other words, their interests aren't always aligned with retail investors, rarely indicating where the price of a stock could actually be heading. Therefore, the best use of this information could be validating your own research or an indicator that has proven to be highly successful in predicting a stock's price movement."", ""With an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, which classifies stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), is a reliable indicator of a stock's near -term price performance. So, validating the Zacks Rank with ABR could go a long way in making a profitable investment decision."", 'ABR Should Not Be Confused With Zacks Rank', 'Although both Zacks Rank and ABR are displayed in a range of 1-5, they are different measures altogether.', 'Broker recommendations are the sole basis for calculating the ABR, which is typically displayed in decimals (such as 1.28). The Zacks Rank, on the other hand, is a quantitative model designed to harness the power of earnings estimate revisions. It is displayed in whole numbers -- 1 to 5.', 'Analysts employed by brokerage firms have been and continue to be overly optimistic with their recommendations. Since the ratings issued by these analysts are more favorable than their research would support because of the vested interest of their employers, they mislead investors far more often than they guide.', 'On the other hand, earnings estimate revisions are at the core of the Zacks Rank. And empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.', 'Furthermore, the different grades of the Zacks Rank are applied proportionately across all stocks for which brokerage analysts provide earnings estimates for the current year. In other words, at all times, this tool maintains a balance among the five ranks it assigns.', 'There is also a key difference between the ABR and Zacks Rank when it comes to freshness. When you look at the ABR, it may not be up-to-date. Nonetheless, since brokerage analysts constantly revise their earnings estimates to reflect changing business trends, and their actions get reflected in the Zacks Rank quickly enough, it is always timely in predicting future stock prices.', 'Is SNPS a Good Investment?', 'In terms of earnings estimate revisions for Synopsys, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has increased 16.3% over the past month to $13.56.', ""Analysts' growing optimism over the company's earnings prospects, as indicated by strong agreement among them in revising EPS estimates higher, could be a legitimate reason for the stock to soar in the near term."", ""The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) for Synopsys.

(NASDAQ:CELH) has emerged as one of the U.S. stock market's top performers over the past decade. Its share price has soared from 26 cents in February 2014 to $64.50 at the time of writing, generating an impressive return of nearly 21,910% or an annualized compounded return of 72.3% over the last 10 years."", ""Despite the recent rapid increase in its share price, I maintain an optimistic outlook for Celsius' long-term potential upside. This optimism is based on the company's high growth potential and its ability to improve its operating profitability going forward."", 'Warning! GuruFocus has detected 6 Warning Signs with CELH.', ""Celsius is the manufacturer and distributor of functional energy drinks and protein bars. Its flagship product, CELSIUS, an energy drink that provides energy while burning calories and body fat. The company's products are distributed through various channels, including convenience stores, mass market, fitness and e-commerce. Celsius ranks as the third-largest player in the U.S. energy drink market, holding a 5.90% market share. It follows Red Bull and Monster (NASDAQ:MNST), which hold market shares of 39.50% and 29.70%."", 'Source: Statista', ""Celsius derives its revenue from three main customers. PepsiCo (NASDAQ:PEP) is the largest one, accounting for 22% of the total revenue in 2022. Costco (NASDAQ:COST) ranked second, representing 16.7% of total sales. Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) stood in third place with 8.80% of the revenue. These leading customers are main distributors of Celsius' products, giving consumers considerable confidence in the brand."", ""Notably, PepsiCo has become the primary distributor for Celsius products in the U.S since August 2022. It also invested $550 million in Celsius' convertible preferred stock, further strengthening the bond between the two companies. I consider the agreement with PepsiCo as a game changer. As PepsiCo is the globally recognized brand with world-wide distribution channels, the deal with PepsiCo opens the door for Celsius to unlimited growth opportunities in both U.S. and international markets."", 'Celsius has managed to grow its revenue every single year for the past 10 years. Remarkably, its revenue soared 85-fold, climbing from $7.68 million in 2012 to $653.60 million in 2022. This growth translates to an impressive annual compounded growth rate of 56%. Despite this substantial revenue growth, the company recorded operating losses in nine out of the last 10 years. The only profitable year was 2020, where it posted operating profits of $7.83 million. In 2022, its operating income plummeted to a loss of nearly $158 million.', 'The significant operating losses in 2022 can be attributed to a substantial rise in selling and marketing expenses. While revenue more than doubled from $314.30 million in 2021 to $653.60 million in 2022, selling and marketing expenses surged nearly fivefold from $74 million to $353 million in just one year.', 'A closer examination reveals the selling and marketing expenses for 2022 included $194 million in termination fees paid to previous distributors as part of transitioning to Pepsi to become its primary distributor in the U.S. This expense is one-time, not recurring. After adjusting for these termination expenses, the adjusted selling and marketing costs would be $159 million only.', 'It is positive that Celsius has achieved significant operating profits during the first nine months of 2023. During this period, the company reported revenue of $970.60 million and operating profits of $207.40 million, resulting in a substantial operating margin of 21.40%.', ""Celsius has a debt-free balance sheet. As of September, the company holds $760 million in cash and has a shareholders' equity of $213.40 million, with no interest-bearing debt at all. This strong financial position allows Celsius significant flexibility to invest in future growth and expand into international markets. However, maintaining a debt-free balance sheet has come at a cost, specifically in the form of an increasing share count, which leads to the dilution of shareholders' equity. The total number of diluted shares has increased from 60.55 million in 2012 to nearly 227 million in 2022."", ""From 2018 to mid-2020, the company's enterprise value-to-revenue ratio consistently remained lower than its larger competitor, Monster Beverage. However, since August 2020, its sales multiples has risen rapidly. At the time of writing, Celsius is trading at 12.40 times its sales, while Monster Beverage is trading at 8 times revenue."", ""The higher valuation of Celsius can be justified by its significantly higher revenue growth compared to Monster Beverage. Since 2020, Celsius has experienced annual revenue growth ranging from 50% to 130%, much higher than Monster Beverage's, which experienced sales increase in the range of only 12% to 20%."", ""Assuming Celsius maintains its historical revenue growth rate of 56% over the next five years, its revenue is projected to reach $12 billion by 2028. If Celsius' operating margin stays at 21%, its operating earnings will be $2.52 billion in 2028. With an earnings multiple of 30, Celsius' enterprise value will be $75.6 billion by 2028. Using a 10% discount rate, the estimated value of Celsius stands at $47 billion. Assuming the company issues 50% more shares over the next five years to fund for its business expansion and acquisitions, the total diluted share count is expected to reach 340 million. Thus, Celsius should be worth $138 per share, 114% higher than its current share price."", ""Celsius Holdings showcases phenomenal business growth, evidenced by its substantial revenue growth and a strong, debt-free balance sheet, emphasizing its financial health. The company's strategic partnership with PepsiCo for the U.S. and international expansion highlights the business' immense potential. Combined with an improving operating margin, Celsius represents a compelling investment opportunity with solid fundamentals and substantial potential upside."", 'This article first appeared on GuruFocus.']"

I don't think anyone would disagree that the macro backdrop isn't as accommodating as it was a few years ago, with higher interest rates and ongoing inflationary pressures prevalent. But demand for Celsius' energy drinks is through the roof."", ""Management has done an excellent job of raising the brand's awareness and distribution capabilities. Celsius is the top-selling energy drink on Amazon, commanding a higher share than well-known rivals Monster and Red Bull. This is an amazing feat because the massive e-commerce platform has billions of visitors every month. This position bodes well for Celsius."", 'In August 2022, PepsiCo took an equity stake in Celsius and became its distribution partner in the U.S. and internationally. This followed a similar strategic move made by Monster, which partnered with Coca-Cola in 2014 to expand its distribution.', 'And that rapid growth has benefited Celsius when it comes to profitability. The company reported operating income of $266 million last year, a huge improvement from the $158 million loss in 2022. Boosting the bottom line was a 14% drop in selling, general, and administrative expenses. Rising earnings are just what shareholders want to see. ', ""Given the stock's rapid ascent, it's not cheap by any means. Celsius trades at a forward price-to-earnings ratio of 72.6. That makes it more expensive than any of the Magnificent Seven stocks."", 'In my opinion, this valuation prices in the assumption that Celsius can continue to grow to the moon. That extreme optimism makes me hesitate to buy shares.', 'Even Wall Street sees a slowdown happening. Consensus analyst estimates call for revenue to increase by 37% this year.

The influence of institutional investors has a partial contribution to this relationship, as these big professionals use earnings and earnings estimates to calculate the fair value of a company's shares. An increase or decrease in earnings estimates in their valuation models simply results in higher or lower fair value for a stock, and institutional investors typically buy or sell it.

(Nasdaq: HOLX) and its subsidiary, Biotheranostics, Inc., today announced newly published study results revealing that use of the Breast Cancer Index® (BCI) test led to physicians changing their long-term anti-estrogen treatment recommendations for 40% of patients with early-stage hormone receptor-positive (HR+) breast cancer.1 The results, which suggest that many women may be over- or undertreated without the incorporation of BCI, reflect real-world data from the largest prospective study assessing the impact of the BCI test on treatment decisions. The study was published in the March issue of the JNCCN — Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network.', 'Previous studies have demonstrated that while some women with early-stage HR+ breast cancer may reduce their risk of recurrence with longer anti-estrogen therapy (10 vs. 5 years), most women do not benefit.2-7 The BCI test is the only genomic test recognized by multiple national oncology guidelines to predict which women are likely to benefit from continuing anti-estrogen therapy beyond five years, helping optimize the duration of treatment.', 'The key results from the JNCCN-published study underscore the value of BCI in helping to avoid:', 'Overtreatment: Of the physician treatment decisions that changed, 63% changed from a YES to a NO recommendation for extended anti-estrogen therapy. This finding suggests a critical role of BCI in helping identify women whose treatment may be discontinued after the first five years to avoid potential side effects and toxicities associated with longer anti-estrogen therapy.', 'Undertreatment: The remaining 37% of changes in treatment decisions by physicians were from a NO to a YES recommendation for extended anti-estrogen therapy. This result highlights an equally important use of BCI: to identify women who may benefit from longer treatment to help avoid a potentially life-threatening metastatic recurrence when extended therapy may not have been previously recommended based on clinical and pathologic risk features alone.', '""These results further reinforce the impact of the Breast Cancer Index test in clinical practice. For many physicians, the test results changed their recommendations for prescribing or not prescribing extended anti-estrogen therapy for patients based on the predictive benefit,"" said Tara Sanft, M.D., the study’s primary author, Associate Professor of Medicine at Yale School of Medicine and Chief Patient Experience Officer at Smilow Cancer Hospital. ""As clinicians, we always strive to give our patients the best clinical advice possible. The Breast Cancer Index helps us prevent over- and undertreatment for extended anti-estrogen therapy and is an incredibly helpful tool, giving us more confidence in our treatment decisions for breast cancer patients.""', 'Patients and physicians included in this study are participants in the BCI Registry Study. The BCI Registry Study is a prospective, large-scale, multi-center study that investigates long-term clinical outcomes, decision impact and medication adherence in patients with early-stage HR+ breast cancer receiving BCI testing as part of routine clinical care. The study concluded with the enrollment of over 3,000 patients who will continue to be followed until 10 years from diagnosis. The current publication reports results assessing the impact of BCI on clinical decision-making regarding extended anti-estrogen therapy in the first 1,000 patients enrolled in the BCI Registry Study.', 'Cancer patients look to their oncology care teams as experts for guidance in recommending the most appropriate treatment plan tailored to their individual health and needs. Ultimately, the newly published findings reveal that when incorporated into routine clinical care, BCI has the potential to provide clinicians with greater confidence in their treatment recommendations, with 39% of providers saying they felt more confident in their recommendation for extended anti-estrogen therapy following BCI testing. Additionally, BCI testing led to 41% of patients feeling more comfortable with their treatment decisions and 45% changing their preference regarding an additional five years of anti-estrogen therapy.', '""For over 35 years, Hologic has been developing diagnostic solutions that are rooted in science and backed by robust clinical data. Alongside our portfolio of Breast and Skeletal Health Solutions, I’m proud of how Hologic’s Diagnostic Solutions division, through Biotheranostics, continues to transform the breast cancer care continuum for women and providers,"" said Jennifer Schneiders, Ph.D., President of Diagnostic Solutions at Hologic. ""As more research is published, I’m thrilled to see the continued, impressive utility of the Breast Cancer Index test. As seen in the results of this study, for women with early-stage hormone receptor-positive breast cancer, this test has the potential to reinforce the importance of the medication they are taking — or to allow them to discontinue treatment without fear of reoccurrence.""', 'About the Breast Cancer Index Test', 'The Breast Cancer Index test is a molecular, gene expression-based test uniquely positioned to provide information to help physicians individualize treatment decisions for patients with early-stage HR+ breast cancer. This breakthrough test helps oncologists and patients navigate the difficult trade-offs between taking steps to prevent recurrence of their disease and facing significant side effects and safety challenges related to unnecessary treatment. The Breast Cancer Index test has guideline designation from the American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) for cancer staging based on molecular profile. The American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO), the European Group on Tumor Markers (EGTM) and the NCCN Clinical Practice Guidelines in Oncology (NCCN Guidelines®) acknowledge the Breast Cancer Index test as a biomarker to inform the extended endocrine treatment decision; and ASCO, EGTM and St. Gallen acknowledge the Breast Cancer Index test as a biomarker to inform the chemotherapy decision.8 BCI is the only validated, commercially available test that predicts the benefit from extended endocrine therapy.', 'The Breast Cancer Index test is intended for routine clinical use and treatment decisions based on results are the responsibility of the physician.

You can skip our detailed analysis of the pharma sector and its performance, and go directly to read 5 Best Pharma Dividend Stocks To Buy in 2024.\xa0', 'Within the healthcare industry in the US, the pharmaceutical sector has experienced significant transformations in recent times. These changes include the influence of the COVID-19 pandemic, the formation of collaborations spanning the entire value chain, and a continuously evolving regulatory landscape. The US pharmaceutical market is the largest in the world, both in terms of revenue and innovation. It plays a crucial role in global healthcare and pharmaceutical research and development. According to S&P Global Ratings, major pharmaceutical companies collectively earned around $700 billion in revenue during 2023, which includes some additional revenue sources beyond pharmaceuticals. This amount constitutes over half of the estimated $1.1 trillion global pharmaceutical market. Moreover, the US accounts for approximately 40% to 50% of the total revenues in the global pharmaceutical industry. The US market is particularly appealing to branded pharmaceutical companies due to substantially higher prices and profit margins compared to other regions.', ""Beyond the financial returns of the pharmaceutical industry in the US, its innovation stands out on the global stage. In recent times, there have been significant advancements in vaccine development, cancer treatments, GLP-1 drugs for managing obesity, gene therapy, gene editing technology for rare diseases, and novel treatments for complex illnesses such as Alzheimer’s disease. However, despite these achievements, the sector grapples with a persistent value problem, leaving investors dissatisfied. Relative to market indices, the pharmaceutical sector continues to underperform in capital markets. The reason for this could be that in 2023, the healthcare field in the US encountered challenging circumstances, marked by persistently high inflation rates, shortages in labor, and the ongoing prevalence of COVID-19. The S&P 500 Pharmaceuticals Select Industry Index, which monitors the performance of pharmaceutical companies, showed a total return of 2.77% for the year, in contrast to the 25.4% return of the broader market. That said, it's worth noting that the pharmaceutical branch did not experience as much decline as other sectors like consumer staples and utilities."", ""One significant factor contributing to the stability of the pharmaceutical area is the active pursuit by pharmaceutical companies to acquire innovative biotech firms through a series of smaller acquisitions, rather than pursuing large-scale mergers. This strategy helps them address potential gaps in their product pipelines more effectively. In a recent development, Novartis AG (NYSE:NVS) has reached an agreement to acquire MorphoSys AG (NASDAQ:MOR), a move aimed at obtaining an experimental medicine for blood cancer that complements Novartis's existing portfolio. This acquisition is among six deals valued at over $1 billion that have been announced just this year, as reported by Bloomberg."", ""The healthcare sector's lackluster performance in 2023 hasn't dampened the enthusiasm of analysts. Healthcare investors and analysts are unexpectedly optimistic about the outlook. Although few anticipate rapid or explosive growth, and certain segments are more favorable than others, there's a prevailing sentiment that the healthcare sector as a whole is poised for a resurgence. Ziad Bakri, a portfolio manager at T. Rowe Price, discussed the outlook for the sector with Barron's this year. Here are some comments from the analyst:"", '“Everyone worries about these stocks in election years, and I feel like we’ve [already] taken a lot of pain. Most of the sub-sectors are pretty well set up for next year.”', 'Mr. Bakri also addressed the impact of GLP-1 weight loss medications, which triggered sell-offs in the medical devices sector. The rationale behind this was the belief that these medications would reduce the necessity for various medical procedures and devices. According to Bakri, many of these stocks have only partially recovered from their losses related to GLP-1. He anticipates that concerns regarding GLP-1 will continue to affect the stocks, but he also mentioned that there may be a growing understanding in the market that the effects will be more prolonged, particularly if interest rates decrease.', 'Pfizer Inc.

You can skip our detailed analysis on trends in the aerospace combat industry and head over directly to the 5 Countries with the Most Attack Helicopters in the World.', 'According to European Security and Defence (ESD), there are about 3,000 attack helicopters currently in operation in over 70 countries. With firepower, speed, and mobility becoming more critical in the battlefield than it has ever been, attack helicopters combine these three elements like no other land-conflict military equipment.', 'Programs dedicated to the development of attack helicopters began in the 1960s. The first notable deployment of the aircraft by the United States was in 1967 with the introduction of the Bell AH-1 Cobra in Vietnam. The single-engine helicopter manufactured by Bell Textron, a subsidiary of Textron Inc. (NYSE:TXT), was rapidly built in response to the needs of the American army during the conflict. More than 1,100 units of the helicopter have been built to-date.', 'Bell Textron is among the major military rotorcraft manufacturers in America’s defense industry. Textron Inc. (NYSE:TXT)’s Bell in 2022 won the US Army’s contract for the Future Long-Range Assault Aircraft programme, which is worth up to $1.3 billion, with plans to replace over 2,000 Black Hawk utility helicopters. This deal with Textron Inc. (NYSE:TXT) is set to be the largest helicopter procurement by the Army in four decades.', 'Another major player in the industry is The Boeing Company (NYSE:BA), which is the maker of the AH-64 Apache turbo-shaft attack helicopter used by the US Army. Defense analysts consider it to be the best helicopter in service currently and expect it to remain in operation till at least 2048. The helicopter has been seen in almost every American and NATO operation since it was launched in 1986.', 'AH-64 Apache can be equipped with cannon, rockets, air-to-air missiles, as well as an advanced precision kill weapon system, which allows it to engage rival helicopters and unmanned aerial vehicles in the airspace, and also take out ground targets including main battle tanks.', 'More than 2,400 units of the attack helicopter have been manufactured by The Boeing Company (NYSE:BA) so far for the US and at least 17 other allies. Poland is set to be the latest country to acquire the AH-64 Apache, after the US in August last year approved a sale worth $12 billion for 96 of these attack helicopters along with other related equipment made by The Boeing Company (NYSE:BA).', 'Apache’s performance can further be bolstered by using Lockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE:LMT)’s Apache Fire Control products which, through their radar and sensor technologies, enhance situational awareness of these helicopters and improve survivability. Several countries have been making use of the company’s offerings. In January 2022, Lockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE:LMT) received a $102 million contract to upgrade Egypt’s 25 AH-64D Apache helicopters. Late last year, Longbow LLC – the joint venture between Lockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE:LMT) and Northrop Grumman Corporation (NYSE:NOC) – got awarded a $10.45 million deal to refurbish the Target Acquisition Designation Sight/Pilot Night Vision Sensor (TADS/PNVS) equipment in the US’ Apache fleet.', 'Pixabay/Public Domain', 'Countries with the most attack helicopters in the world are ranked in ascending order of their fleet size. Data has been sourced from our recent article, 25 Countries With The Strongest Armies In The World. In case where two or more countries had the same number of attack helicopters in their fleets, we outranked one over the other on the capabilities of their helicopters.', 'By the way, Insider Monkey is an investing website that tracks the movements of corporate insiders and hedge funds.

Whether you are a beginner investor or professional one looking for the best stocks to buy, you can benefit from the wisdom of hedge funds and corporate insiders.', 'Let’s now head over to the list of countries with the most attack helicopters in the world.', 'Attack Helicopters: 48', 'Israel has 48 AH-64 Apache attack helicopters that it procured from the United States. These are the strongest combat helicopters in the world, and have been deployed in the ongoing military conflict in Gaza. Tel Aviv has recently requested the US for ‘slots’ in Boeing’s chopper plant to deliver new helicopters to Israel as a top-priority. The Middle Eastern country also has other helicopters in its fleet which are multi-purpose and used for missions such as scouting and reconnaissance. These include AS565 Panther, Bell 206, and Bell OH-58 Kiowa.', 'Attack Helicopters: 52', 'The United Kingdom is among countries with the most attack helicopters in the world, with a fleet size of 52 as of 2023. In October last year, the British Army’s AH-64E attack helicopters passed the battlefield tests and were declared ready for frontline duty. According to the Ministry of Defence, these choppers destroy air defense units, tanks, and armored fighting vehicles of the enemies. Other military helicopters in service of the United Kingdom include the Boeing CH-47 Chinook, Wildcat Mk1, AW159, SA341 and Bell 212.', 'Attack Helicopters: 55', 'Next on our list of countries with the most attack helicopters is Germany, which has a fleet size of 55 – with the majority of them being the Eurocopter Tiger manufactured by Airbus Helicopters. According to a report in Janes earlier this year, the Bundeswehr is set to retire Tiger by 2032, six years earlier than its planned retirement in 2038. In July last year, the German government approved a $8.5 billion order for 60 CH-47F Chinook heavy-lift helicopters, followed by a deal with Airbus later in December for 82 multi-role H145M helicopters.', 'Attack Helicopters: 57', 'According to FlightGlobal, Pakistan had close to 250 military helicopters by the end of 2022. Of these, about 57 are considered to be attack helicopters, that are dedicated entirely to combat. These include 50 Bell AH-1F Cobra procured from the United States, three Z-10E attack helicopters from China, and 4 Russian Mi-35 choppers. Another 17 Z-10 helicopters are currently under order.\xa0', 'Attack Helicopters: 57', 'The Italian military has 57 attack helicopters. The main chopper used by Italy for combat operations is the A129 Mangusta, which entered service in 1990. According to a report, the Italian military plans to phase out the Mangusta starting 2025 and replace it with the AW249 Fenice built by Leonardo Helicopters.', 'Attack Helicopters: 69', 'France is among countries with the most attack helicopters in the world, with a fleet size of 69. All of these comprise the Eurocopter Tiger. Last year in July, the United States approved the sale of Hellfire missiles to France for its Tiger attack choppers in a deal valued at $203 million. Paris is currently assessing the possibility of upgrading its fleet with drones compatibility, according to reports. Other military helicopters operated by France for varying operations such as scouting, surveillance, transport, and reconnaissance include the Eurocopter Fennec AS555, Eurocopter EC725, and SA 330 Puma.', 'Attack Helicopters: 75', 'Algeria is the third most powerful military in Africa, and relies on Russia for much of its equipment. With a fleet size of 75, it is among countries with the most attack helicopters in the world. According to the Global Firepower Index 2024, the African country has 298 helicopters that currently operate for military purposes. Its fleet of attack helicopters mainly comprise the Mil Mi-28 and Mil Mi-24.', 'Attack Helicopters: 91', 'Half way through our list is Taiwan, a country that right since independence has focused on building a potent military force amid China’s looming threat of invasion. The country currently operates 91 attack helicopters, which include 62 AH-1W Super Cobra and 29 AH-64E Apache. Taipei’s decision to paint its AH-64E Apache helicopters with tiger shark-inspired paint schemes have made these deadly choppers look even more sinister.', 'Attack Helicopters: 100', 'Egypt is the most powerful military in Africa, and is equipped with large fleets of modern sophisticated equipment, ranging from battle tanks to fighter jets and attack helicopters. It recently became the first country to use the Russian KA-52 attack helicopters outside of Russia. These choppers comprise nearly half (46) of all its anti-aircraft helicopters. The African country also possesses dozens of Apache helicopters which it has procured from the United States.\xa0', 'Attack Helicopters: 111', 'Turkiye finds itself among countries with the most attack helicopters in the world, with a fleet size of 111, which is a mixture of American Cobra attack helicopters’ AH-1P/S and AH-1W models, as well as the homegrown T129s. The country has a rapidly developing defense sector at home, and last year’s launch of Turkiye’s locally-made T929 attack helicopter was testament to that. Defense analysts believe that the new chopper, powered with Ukrainian engines, is likely to be categorized in the same class as the Apache and Ka-52 attack helicopters.

Indeed, you'd think it would be an offer that Terran Orbital shareholders should jump at."", 'But not so fast.', ""The devil's in the details on this offer, folks, so let's make sure to read those details carefully -- starting with the fact that Lockheed Martin is actually only offering to pay shareholders $1 per share for their Terran Orbital stock, while the stock currently costs $1.20 per share. Furthermore, Terran Orbital only has about 194.5 million shares outstanding."", 'So, how does $1 a share times 194.5 million shares work out to a valuation of $600 million, exactly?', ""The math works like this: First, Lockheed's purchase price would actually be only the $194.5 million you'd think it would be for a $1-per-share offer. The other $400 million or so in valuation on this deal comes from Lockheed's plan to buy up all of Terran Orbital's outstanding warrants to buy shares ($70 million), plus its offer to take on Terran Orbital's outstanding debts ($313 million)."", 'Add it all up, and you get a deal value price of about $577.5 million -- or $600 million if you round up.', ""Terran Orbital knows all of this, of course. That's why on Monday it quickly swallowed a poison pill to slow Lockheed Martin's roll while Terran management mulls the offer."", 'Technically called a shareholder rights plan, this tactic aims to ""reduce the likelihood that any person or group gains control of the Company through open market accumulation, or other coercive tactics potentially disadvantaging the interests of all stockholders."" And it does this by distributing to existing owners of Terran Orbital stock (on a 1:1 basis), free of charge, new rights to buy shares of preferred stock.', ""As a result, to swallow Terran Orbital, Lockheed Martin might first have to buy out these preferred shares as well. (But Terran Orbital will be able to revoke these rights for a de minimis price at a later date, if it decides to accept Lockheed Martin's offer and proceed with a sale of the company)."", ""I expect that after taking some time to think things over, Terran Orbital will ultimately accept Lockheed Martin's offer. With nearly $200 million in debt already, less than $40 million in the bank, and burning $150 million a year, the company isn't in a very strong position to negotiate. And in that case, it's unlikely investors will see a sales price much better than the current $1 offer."", ""If I owned Terran Orbital stock worth $1.20 per share today, I'd take the money and run."", 'Should you invest $1,000 in Terran Orbital right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Terran Orbital, consider this:', 'The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\xa010 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Terran Orbital wasn’t one of them.

(Operator Instructions) As a reminder, today's call is being recorded, and it is now my pleasure to turn the floor over to your host, David Fischel, Chairman and CEO of Stereotaxis."", 'David Fischel', ""Thank you, operator, and good afternoon, everyone. It's a very exciting, productive, busy challenging and promising period for Stereotaxis. We are glad to be entering this year, having made significant progress towards realizing our strategic transformation given where we stand, we have high confidence in the key puzzle pieces of this strategy coming together in the coming months, putting Stereotaxis on solid strategic foundation and providing line of sight to when commercial breakouts are possible. We are driving this progress against the backdrop of various challenges, which highlight the merits of our strategy. It is always helpful to view one's position in a broader context, it's being our annual call. I want to use the occasion to step back and provide that perspective. I'll then share specific updates on our innovation and commercial efforts. Kim will then provide details on our financial results, and we will open the line to questions. Stereotaxis overarching mission is to improve minimally invasive endovascular surgery with the precision safety and unique capabilities of robots. We are the pioneer and global leader in endovascular robotics and have demonstrated the clinical relevance and value of our technology in robust real-world use at over 100 hospitals that have treated 150,000 patients despite having pioneered a highly differentiated and advanced technology that works reliably in the real world and provides meaningful clinical value. Stereotaxis has a long history of commercial struggles. After joining Stereotaxis, I recognize that these struggles could be traced to structural weaknesses with our product ecosystem. These weaknesses put Stereotaxis in a challenging position with commercial disadvantages and strategic dependencies and made adoption of robotics very difficult even for our strongest advocates. We identified three key structural issues. First, in our core existing market, electrophysiology, cardiac ablation procedures for the treatment of arrhythmias. We built our business dependent on Johnson & Johnson. We were only integrated with their diagnostic mapping system and they manufacture the ablation catheter used in every one of our procedures that dependency Limited, the ability for patients and physicians to benefit from continuous innovation, created commercial challenges and provided Johnson & Johnson rather than Stereotaxis with the majority of economic value from every robotic procedure. Second, installing our robotic system in a cath lab is a significant construction process requiring architectural planning rooms, shielding and reinforcement, special electrical work and hiring contractors, which all add complexity, time, effort and expense. This process leads to very long sales cycles and a high bar for adoption. The vast majority of interested potential customers ultimately never succeed in getting a system. Third, while Stereotaxis' robotic technology is designed as a platform technology enabling the treatment of a broad spectrum of complex endovascular procedures. The company did not offer the interventional tools to allow for this expansion of indications being limited to one specific procedure as large and attractive as the cardiac ablation market is doesn't provide for healthy diversification and full appreciation of our opportunity being clear-eyed and intellectually honest was the first step in improvement. We worked hard over the subsequent years to formulate a comprehensive and elegant strategy to address these weaknesses. Strategy was creative and required significant innovations, but was realistic for us to accomplish while controlling technological and financial risk. It was attractive in providing strategic independence and the opportunity for substantial commercial breakout. Most importantly, it fundamentally improves and broadens our product offering for the patients, physicians and hospitals that rely on that Stereotaxis has advanced its comprehensive innovation strategy over several years through the development process. 2024 is the year in which we expect all the key puzzle pieces to come together, setting us up with multiple shots on goal for breakout growth in 2025. A few updates on the key innovation efforts Sockolow in our existing cardiac ablation market. Our key effort has been to address our strategic dependency, develop a proprietary ablation catheter and create an open ecosystem around our robot. We are we were delighted today to announce initial clinical results and regulatory submissions for the magic catheter, our proprietary advanced robotically navigated ablation catheter. Following our earnings call last November, we received approvals to initiate a human clinical trial of magic in both Mr. Lanier and Dennis Juliet University in Lithuania enrolled its first patient at the start of this year and completed enrollment of the 20th patient in January. The results from these initial procedures were stellar and were summarized by the physicians in a manuscript recently submitted for publication in a prominent electrophysiology journal across these 20 patients ranging ranging in age from young adults to the elderly and suffering a range of arrhythmias. There was 100% acute success in treating the ready meals and no adverse events or device or procedure-related safety events, additional patients beyond these 20 have been treated in both Australia and Denmark with consistent positive results beyond stellar clinical outcomes. Qualitative commentary from all the physicians who participated in the trial was very positive, reinforcing our confidence in the impact Magic will have on patients and physicians. We resubmitted the magic catheter to the European notified body and believe the data fully addresses the requests made last summer where we were told clinical data would be necessary to be granted CE mark under the more rigorous MDR requirements. We also submitted the magic catheter for U.S. regulatory approval as a PMA supplement to the FDA. Clinical data adds to a substantial body of bench preclinical clinical and published clinical literature supporting the value of robotic cardiac ablation generally and the safety and effectiveness of Magic. Specifically, while there is always uncertainty with any regulatory submission, we do believe we made strong submissions and have received feedback to that effect from experts in our field. We look forward to working collaboratively with the regulatory bodies in the coming months to ensure the magic catheter becomes available for the patients and physicians who depend on the launch of Magic will benefit from our strong collaboration with Abbott and last year's successful launch of the mapping integration with Abbott and site X mapping system. We are seeing continued expansion in the adoption of our integrated technologies in both the US and Europe. This is a significant strategic collaboration in its early phases, and we are delighted with how our progressing. The second major initiative in our innovation strategy was to address the challenges and complexities of adopting robots. We developed a smaller self shielding robot that significantly enhances its accessibility by removing the requirement for cath lab construction. We discussed on the last call our balanced approach to the timing of a regulatory submission such that approval of the robot aligns approximately with market availability of Magic. The robot has gone through design freeze and now begun formal testing. We are confident in regulatory submissions in both the United States and Europe in the second quarter and expect to regulatory clearance in Europe midyear. Our experience selling Genesis gives us daily visibility into the time line shifts and hospital construction delays that slow adoption even at sites that are most motivated to build a robotic program. This experience reinforces our confidence that the availability of a smaller and more accessible robot, something that can be installed without construction will serve as a significant structural improvement to the pace and scale of adoption following approval, we plan to use the current year to demonstrate the reality of the robot in real-world use, enhance compatibility of the robot with various x-rays and prepare supply chain, manufacturing, installation and commercial processes for a full launch in 2025. Our third strategic innovation effort is development of a family of interventional guidewires guide catheters that expand the benefits of our robot into new endovascular indications with five specific multi-billion dollar opportunities being targeted neuro interventions, coronary angioplasty Peripheral Interventions, tumor embolization and triple-A graft. First, Guidewire is fully designed and in conjunction with our contract manufacturer, we have been grinding through the challenges of establishing high quality and robust manufacturing processes. We expect to complete the manufacturing and testing of the significant number of guidewires necessary for a regulatory submission in the middle of this year and still expect commercial availability of the Guidewire late in the year. Once we have made regulatory submissions, we will host an Innovation Day to allow several key physicians from multiple specialties to share their perspective and experience with where our robotic technology can add critical value in the broader field of endovascular surgery. These three innovations, the magic catheter, newer mobile robot and endovascular devices are our strategic response to the three structural limitations described earlier, we have line of sight to them attaining key regulatory approvals and commencing commercialization in 2024 with growing commercial impact in 2025. Beyond these big three innovations, we were fortunate to nurture two additional opportunistic growth drivers that are synergistic and additive to our core efforts in China, we entered into a strategic collaboration with MicroPort to establish add to establish a China-specific EP product ecosystem. Microport recently submitted to China's NMPA regulatory body, the robotically navigated ablation catheter we developed together, we have completed mapping integration with our Columbus mapping system and Genesis, as expected, received Chinese regulatory approval midyear. As this core product ecosystem is available, we expect to benefit from MicroPort substantial commercial footprint already servicing hundreds of hospitals. Our second synergistic and opportunistic venture is a digital surgery platform that enables broad operating room connectivity, both alongside our robotic platform and independently in non-robotic labs to sync cloud-based connectivity app has been released internally for our team in preparation for an external release. We are still finalizing remaining hardware, firmware and software efforts with the Synchrony integrated display capability, but expect to begin formal regulatory testing in the second quarter, followed by submissions in summer. We will continue a soft launch of things till then, but plan for a full launch of Synchrony and St. As a combined solution, enabling streamlined workflow connectivity and collaboration broadly in any operation, Synchrony hardware will provide an incremental upfront capital sales opportunity while SYNC will be available with a freemium SaaS business model with premium subscriptions for hospitals, medical device salesforces and physician users. I recognize our progress has taken longer than expected and faced unforeseen challenges with key regulatory submissions and technology developments done. We see the puzzle pieces falling into place this year. While there is risk and uncertainty with any regulatory process, our strategy is derisked with multiple shots on goal in each of our three key geographies, the United States, Europe and China. We have the opportunity for a full ecosystem coming together and driving breakout growth. The opportunity in any individual geography can dwarf our current entire business. We are driving this innovation transformation while working hard to ensure our commercial momentum and financial strength are preserved. We continue to see signs of commercial progress with positive feedback and utilization of Genesis as well as capital interest in Genesis from both existing users and completely new customers in the fourth quarter, we were excited to receive a Genesis order from a greenfield hospital in Germany. Germany as a country was one of the most enthusiastic earliest adopters of the first NIOBE system. And then also, unfortunately the region with the strongest backlash for robotics, given that first NIOBE systems were launched, prematurely to see our installed base grow with new physician users in Germany is particularly encouraging. Given that historical context, the order represented our 12th greenfield robotic order globally since the launch of Genesis and our 24th order. Overall, we begin 2024 with $14.7 million in backlog from orders that were received, but not yet shipped or installed. While we continue to see a healthy pipeline of greenfield and replacement cycle customers for Genesis. Overall, progress is slow beyond the well understood challenges of closing a substantial capital sale for a system that requires hospital construction. Several electrophysiologists have expressed their concern with the recurring catheter shortages of Johnson & Johnson and the awareness of the dependency on J & J's catheters in absence of our own Magic catheter as a replacement, while this has not deterred some hospitals from moving forward. It serves as an additional risk item that extends due diligence and delayed purchase decisions. We believe our regulatory submissions of Magic will partially help. And then obviously, receipt of approvals will address this concern. Despite this pressure, we expect a continued pace of robotic system orders and sales with expected growth for both in 2024 compared to 2023. Our recurring revenue was also impacted by the catheter shortage from J&J, which impacted procedure volumes as well as the loss of royalty payments from J&J, which created a $2 million headwind to both our top and bottom line results. We continue to see inconsistent availability of the J&J catheter flare up in various geographies and accounts, but expect overall recurring revenue in 2024 to be consistent, what's 2023. Our burn rate in 2023 was lower than 2022 despite these revenue challenges, so the absolute burn rate was still higher than what we expected. Our balance sheet remains strong with approximately $20 million cash and no debt. We are cognizant of the importance of financial prudence and are confident our existing balance sheet allows us to advance our transformative product ecosystem to market and fund its commercialization. We have already invested a significant inventory of direct commercial team globally that are well-suited to launch the new products as they become available. We expect a lower burn rate in 2024 compared to 2023, driven by increased Genesis robotic revenue and reduced cash outflows as some of the most significant R&D spending is behind us, and we take our inventory purchasing Kim will now provide additional commentary on our financial results, and then I will make a few financial comments as well before opening the call to Q&A. Kim?"", 'Kimberly Peery', 'Thank you, David, and good afternoon, everyone. revenue for the fourth quarter of 2023 totaled $4.6 million compared to $7.3 million in the prior year fourth quarter. System revenue was $0.1 million and recurring revenue was $4.5 million compared to $2.2 million and $5.1 million in the prior year fourth quarter. System revenue was abnormally weak due to delays in hospital construction schedules and no shipments being made. As a result, recurring revenue was in line with recent quarters, but below the prior year level due to Stereotaxis no longer receiving royalty payments from Johnson & Johnson revenue for the full year 2023 totaled $26.8 million compared to $28.1 million in 2022. Full year system revenue was $8.7 million compared to $6.8 million in the prior year, reflecting increased system deliveries and installation. We started 2024 with system backlog of $14.7 million. Full year recurring revenue was $18 million compared to $21.3 million reflecting the continued absence of the J&J royalty and periodic catheter shortages by Johnson & Johnson. Gross margin for the fourth quarter and full year 2023 were approximately 60% and 56% of revenue. For the full year 2023, we reported gross margin of 79% on recurring revenue and 8% for system revenue. System gross margins continue to reflect relatively low production volumes combined with significant allocations to fixed overhead and related expenses. Operating expenses in the fourth quarter were $8 million. Excluding $2.6 million in non-cash stock compensation expense, adjusted operating expenses in the current quarter were $5.4 million compared to prior year adjusted operating expenses of $6.2 million. Adjusted operating expenses for the full year 2023 were $26.2 million compared with $26.8 million in the prior year. Operating loss and net loss for the fourth quarter of 2023 were $5.3 million and $5 million compared to $4.5 million and $4.2 million in the previous year. Adjusted operating loss and adjusted net loss for the quarter, excluding non-cash stock compensation expense were $2.7 million and $2.4 million compared to $1.9 million and $1.6 million in the previous year. For the full year 2023, adjusted operating loss of $11.3 million, and adjusted net loss of $10.2 million compared to an adjusted operating loss of $8.3 million and an adjusted net loss of $7.8 million in the prior year. Negative free cash flow for the full year 2023 was $9.1 million compared to $10.8 million for the full year 2022. At December 31, we had cash and cash equivalents of $20.6 million and no debt. I will now hand the call back to David.', 'David Fischel', 'Thank you, Kim. We are cognizant that accurately guiding revenue has been challenging and there has been significant volatility in quarterly revenue results as any individual robot sale has a significant impact on the quarter. Humbled by that experience, we are providing specific revenue guidance only for this current first quarter of 2024, in which we expect revenue of approximately $7 million. Looking at the full year 2024, we generally expect recurring revenue to remain stable until MAGIC can contribute to disposable revenue growth. We expect continued growth in system revenue through conversion of our $14.7 million backlog and new system orders with system revenue growth driving overall double-digit revenue growth for the year, expect our bolus of innovation to play a decisive role in driving breakout revenue growth in 2025 and beyond. We will now take your questions. Operator, can you please open the line to Q&A?', 'Operator', '(Operator Instructions) Frank Takkinen, Lake Street Capital Markets.', 'Frank Takkinen', ""Great. Thanks for taking the questions. Maybe to start with the MAGIC catheters submissions and the EU submission, how should we handicap that being a resubmitted file? I assume that there's a little bit more certainty that they'll come back with a clearance on that now that they've had a chance to really review it once and they made their request. But maybe is there any way to kind of risk adjust that given it's already been looked at once? And then two on the FDA side, one was that submitted, is that a standard 180 day review or how should we think about the process between now and the clearance expectation you put out there?"", 'David Fischel', ""Yes. Hi, Frank. Thanks for the questions. So and generally, I want to state that we're in. We're not going to give a lot of commentary on regulatory submissions or the review during the review period. Other than that, we think we made a strong submission and obviously, we're going to work collaboratively with the reviewers over the coming months and look forward to working collaboratively with them. And your commentary on the EU submission, you're correct and it is a resubmission of the vast, vast majority of the information with just and the addition of the clinical data. And we are fortunate that the reviewers and are the same reviewers that looked at the submission a year ago. And so that should support the review process in a more efficient fashion. There's no statutory time limit of the review. So we are obviously beholden to the notified body and when they're able to review things. But a given given the history there and given the multiple discussions that took place last year, we do we are hopeful and believe it's reasonable to assume that this will be a much more efficient process. And with the U.S. FDA, this is a 180 day PMA supplement, and we expect to work collaboratively with FDA during the review process. And it wouldn't be surprising if during that review process. And we do kind of have additional questions and discussions with FDA. So we're not I wouldn't kind of I think that necessarily the 180 days has to be the way it's going to play out. But overall it is a 180 day PMA supplement process."", 'Frank Takkinen', ""Okay. That's perfect. And then maybe thinking about once those clearances occur, how should we think about how quickly the uptake could occur within the installed base, maybe starting with how many procedures you're doing today would be helpful context. And then how quickly you can roll that the magic catheter into your established sites and swap out the old catheter for the new ones."", 'David Fischel', ""Sure. So we've talked before about doing under 10,000 procedures a year with approximately 40%, 45% of that volume in Europe; 40%, 45% of that volume in the US; and about 10%, 20% of that volume in Asia. And so that's kind of the overall installed base. So we have several thousand procedures a year each in both Europe and the US. And we we've talked about previously the structural barriers in Europe where in certain geographies and certain countries, certain regions you do pursue then at local tenders after you have CE. mark, while in others, really the only structural barrier is a contract with the hospital and setting a price with the hospital. And generally, I would expect given also the fact that we are gaining a real-world clinical experience with the catheter currently through the through the clinical trial, I would expect a relatively and quicker ramp in catheter adoption as it becomes available and the things that we have to do in tandem with gaining regulatory approval is and scaling of manufacturing and building up sufficient stock for ag for a commercial launch. And then also the work that we're doing with Abbott to add to convert existing users which historically were predominantly using Johnson & Johnson's mapping system to using the current integrated offering with them with Abbott, that will also be beneficial in accelerating adoption. So those are the things we think about as we think about adoption, but overall expect to see a relatively rapid transition and over for, let's say, a handful of quarters."", 'Frank Takkinen', ""Okay.. That's helpful. I'll stop there. Thanks taking the questions."", 'David Fischel', 'Thank you.', 'Operator', 'Jason Wittes, ROTH MKM.', 'Jason Wittes', ""I have answering the questions and congrats on the submission here in terms of you just kind of highlighted a little bit, but in terms of the this year's outlook, should we expect anything from Magic this year? Or is it really a 2025 event."", 'David Fischel', ""We didn't discuss that, and thanks for joining us, Jason, and glad to have you on the call again. And we are we didn't incorporate any and revenue from magic in the in the commentary we provided in terms of how we generally think about this year's revenue. And that said, it would be surprising if we do not generate some revenue from it from magic in the back half of this year. And it will really be dependent on the timing of regulatory approval in terms of how much how much to expect. And so I think until we don't until we don't have that approval in hand, it's hard for us to estimate how much to contribute. But I but I would definitely expect that we get that at least one approval prior to the end of this year was the chance for Magic to start to contribute to recurring revenue."", 'Jason Wittes', ""Okay. That's helpful. Thanks. And also appreciate the backlog information of [$4.7 million]. I mean, roughly what is the expectation in terms of how long those take to get placed US in a hospital."", 'David Fischel', 'Sure. So and so just that it is $14.7 million (multiple speakers)', 'Jason Wittes', 'I said that wrong information, yeah.', 'David Fischel', ""And so overall, we would estimate and I'm looking at Kim right now, she wants it correctly that typically you would estimate that approximately 80% of that will be recognized as revenue and getting the sums up. So that seems correct where about 80% of that should be recognized within a given year. We have seen scenarios where hospitals that were planning to take delivery at a specific date pushed back that date during due to their own challenges. And so there is and there's not guarantees of that playing out as we've seen even up till the fourth quarter, obviously in the results of our fourth quarter but at. But generally that 80% within one year for backlog is a general rule that hold."", 'Jason Wittes', ""Okay. That's helpful. And then last question, just in terms of supply issues with the current catheter and any updates from your suppliers, are there any change in outlook or how should we be thinking about this for 2024?"", 'David Fischel', ""Yes. So just to be clear, the catheter shortages are not from a supplier of ours nor from a company that we have any control over this is all related to that dependency, which I described before were Johnson & Johnson independently manufacturers. It sells and supplies the magnetic ablation catheters that are used alongside our robot and so we do not have control over them or even influence over them in the same way that we would have influenced with a with a supplier that we have hired and worked with. We have seen this crop this cropped up over a year ago now about a year and a half ago, we have seen and it continued shortages at that flare up in various specific geographies, various accounts. And there is a randomness to it, though it does definitely pressure the physicians and hospitals that rely on our technology and create disturbances to their normal practices. And so I think given where we stand right now, it seems like the intensity and distribution of those flare-ups doesn't seem worse than it was a year ago. And so it seems like overall and the numbers this year should look similar to last year, but there is an aspect of dependency there. And that, again speaks to how and how valuable and important having magic on the market will be."", 'Jason Wittes', ""Great. Thanks. I'll jump back in queue."", 'David Fischel', 'Thank you very much, Jason.', 'Operator', 'Alex Nowak, Craig Hallum.', 'Alex Nowak', ""Okay, great. Good afternoon, everyone. Not continuing the manufacturing question there. Just with regards to the magic, if you do get the approvals, let's just say second half of this year for both Europe and U.S., how quickly can you ramp up manufacturing?"", 'David Fischel', ""Hi, Alex, thanks and good afternoon. And so overall that is something that we've been working with Otsuka, our contract manufacturing partner in Germany to improve as they have significant experience manufacturing, thousands of units have various interventional devices. And so they have the organizational capabilities to do that with every product does its own scaling effort during the at formal regulatory testing of Magic, we did produce I believe it was nearly 1,000 units of the catheter. So they demonstrated their capability to scale manufacturing add to those to that type of level we are working with them have been working with them. We'll continue working with them so that they can scale to the point where we're able to service the entire European and U.S. installed base. And I think that probably reaching that level still over the course of this year is probably aggressive, but but that's what we're shooting for. And there are all sorts of incentives in place to increase to increase that manufacturing."", 'Alex Nowak', 'Okay. That is great. To hear maybe expand on the qualitative commentary with the physicians who were using magic in the European study. Just what are they like about it versus the J&J device specifically.', 'David Fischel', ""Sure, so I had I had the good fortune of being able to actually watch at eight procedures when I visited Vilnius University and in January and then and I think that kind of it. Obviously, you recognize that the financial, the strategic and the independence of benefits of having the catheter, the fact that the catheter serves as the enabling technology for our mobile robot. So all of those are kind of the more strategic aspects from our side. And from a clinician's perspective, how does the catheter benefit the patient and the physician I'd say that that some of the main benefits that were described by the physicians, one was an observation that the stability of the catheter was particularly nice. And we our magnetic catheters are known that one of their key benefits is stability. Oftentimes, that stability is dependent on your approach towards the tissue, and they felt that irrespective of how they approach the tissue with the catheter. They had very, very good stability beyond what typically they considered very good stability with the with the existing magnetic catheters. That was one thing that was particularly called out and the ease of navigation and how that was more intuitive than what they were used to was a second observation that was called out. And then the fact that reduced fluid is required to cool the catheter that said, that should benefit patients that have renal issues or longer procedures. And that just generally that creates a reduced fluid load for patient. And so some of those were some of the things that I remember from my from a visit and from the discussions with physicians, I think kind of those are at some of the key benefits both for patients and physicians as they switch to Magic."", 'Alex Nowak', 'Okay, great. And then just last question on are you teeing up any U.S. studies just in case the government know the FDA comes back and request additional U.S. data. Just how quickly could you turn something like that around?', 'David Fischel', ""I believe in the coming months, we will have a much clearer feeling coming few months, we'll have a much clearer feeling for the regulatory path in the U.S. given what we've done in Europe. That has been very helpful in in educating us and giving us certain infrastructure to run clinical trials more broadly. And if you step back and think about Stereotaxis as a company, we have a very they're a unique and kind of a special capability in terms of building robots. That's something that almost no other company has very few companies have has demonstrated the capability to build robots that can actually be deployed in real world clinical setting and can work robustly and reliably. And there we have that capability in-house. We did not have a historical expertise and her experience in developing interventional devices. And that doesn't just mean the engineering aspects in the quality, clinical regulatory aspect related to interventional interbody devices. And I think that kind of as we've gone through this process, both from a regulatory perspective, now setting up the clinical trial in Europe and all the testing processes that we went through. That all gives us more of an institutional capability in order to replicate those again in the future. And so I think there is definitely a benefit from what we've now demonstrated. We're able to pull off in Europe and then and depending on how the next few months go, we'll have a feeling on whether that's necessary to start that in the US."", 'Alex Nowak', 'Okay, great. I appreciate the update. Thank you.', 'David Fischel', 'Thank you very much, Alex.', 'Operator', 'Adam Maeder, Piper Sandler.', 'Adam Maeder', 'David and Kim, thank you for taking the questions here. I wanted to ask a question on the sales force. With the the MAGIC launch and the mobile launch coming down the pike here, we will look to build out the sales force to support those launches? Is that a 2025 event? Or is the plan to kind of push forward with initial infrastructure? Sorry, the existing infrastructure? And then I had a follow-up. Thanks.', 'David Fischel', ""Hi, Adam. Good afternoon and thanks for the questions. So and we have done a small incremental hiring in Europe already late last year, early this year. And in anticipation of a magic launch and ensuring that we have the ability to launch Magic across our installed base with the added level of coverage and service that that would entail and as discussed in the past, as we launch the catheter initially, we would plan to use our existing sales teams both in the US and Europe at two to cover those accounts to launch magic. They are in all of these accounts. They have the relationships we have and we have a good team that has good electrophysiology knowledge. And so they're more than capable of launching the magic catheter in a successful fashion. And we would though start to reinvest any proceeds from the catheter back into and the sales team so that we grow the team and to gradually evolve to something more like a larger players in the space who oftentimes have one or even more than one individual per per account per hospital customer and so I would see us kind of growing that sales team, but we will do it as we're growing the revenue of the natural catheters. And similarly, on the capital side, I would say that we are we know that with any new robotic system, the scaling of supply chain, manufacturing and deployment of the robot is a process that takes many months and even with the new robot that doesn't have the construction requirements, there are still those styles of infrastructure and kind of process improvements that play out over a period of months and so I'd say that we will probably as we gain approval, we will probably slightly increase the capital sales capability in the relevant geography. And then we'll start to show most of the benefit, though from having the robot is that our existing capital sales teams should be able to be much more effective because we've reduced the complexity and time lines related to their sales work. And so as we start to see that playing out as we start to see the robot, the outturn in the world working successfully and well as we're able to scale our supply chain and manufacturing, then again, will incrementally be building the sales team. And I think that kind of you'll see most of that type of real marketing share and effort in building the commercial team happening in 2025 with some of the preparatory work being done already this year."", 'Adam Maeder', ""That's great color. Appreciate that, David. Thank you. And then for the follow-up, I wanted to switch gears and ask about mobile. If I heard correctly regulate your regulatory submissions both in the US and Europe for Q2 events can you just maybe share what's left to still be done ahead of submission for the regulatory agencies? And just talk about what's informing the confidence there that you're be able to make healthy submissions and ultimately garner regulatory clearance. Thank you."", 'David Fischel', ""Sort of So where we are, we have at the formal the full body of formal regulatory testing that you have to do before you can do a submission and there is still various testing that needs to be done there. Most of it done internally with our team. Some of it is done through external testing services that you have to do to an extent alternative testing it and service. And then so that is all expected to play out over the next, let's say, month to couple of months. And then you have to obviously put together all of the documentation for the submission. And that happens concurrent with testing. But there's always some work after you finish the testing process overall, our confidence comes from the fact that we have this is really our expertise robots, and we we went through a process very, very similar to this it's just about four years ago, four, five years ago when we came when we submitted the Genesis robot. And so we have that well, the organizational infrastructure, the muscle memory, the documentation that we can leverage for these types of processes. And we have a skilled team that has that has run this playbook I before, including very recently. And so that gives us the confidence we've had preparatory discussions with regulators. We have clarity on what the regulatory path is and so that gives us kind of that confidence."", 'Adam Maeder', 'Helpful. Thank you.', 'David Fischel', 'Thank you.', 'Operator', ""This concludes today's question and answer session. I would now like to turn the call over to David Fischel for closing remarks."", 'David Fischel', 'Okay. Thank you very much for all your thoughtful questions.

Afterward, he went back to work and resumed his route.', 'After a nationwide call for entries, finalists were identified and reviewed by a panel of independent industry judges to help select VanNostrand and Ramos as the grand prize winners.

(NYSE:RSG) were released last week, making it a good time to revisit its performance. The result was positive overall - although revenues of US$15b were in line with what the analysts predicted, Republic Services surprised by delivering a statutory profit of US$5.47 per share, modestly greater than expected. Following the result, the analysts have updated their earnings model, and it would be good to know whether they think there's been a strong change in the company's prospects, or if it's business as usual. With this in mind, we've gathered the latest statutory forecasts to see what the analysts are expecting for next year."", ' See our latest analysis for Republic Services ', ""After the latest results, the 19 analysts covering Republic Services are now predicting revenues of US$16.2b in 2024. If met, this would reflect a notable 8.1% improvement in revenue compared to the last 12 months. Per-share earnings are expected to accumulate 7.9% to US$5.94. In the lead-up to this report, the analysts had been modelling revenues of US$15.8b and earnings per share (EPS) of US$5.89 in 2024. So it looks like there's been no major change in sentiment following the latest results, although the analysts have made a modest lift to to revenue forecasts."", ""The analysts increased their price target 12% to US$194, perhaps signalling that higher revenues are a strong leading indicator for Republic Services's valuation. That's not the only conclusion we can draw from this data however, as some investors also like to consider the spread in estimates when evaluating analyst price targets. Currently, the most bullish analyst values Republic Services at US$215 per share, while the most bearish prices it at US$143. These price targets show that analysts do have some differing views on the business, but the estimates do not vary enough to suggest to us that some are betting on wild success or utter failure."", ""These estimates are interesting, but it can be useful to paint some more broad strokes when seeing how forecasts compare, both to the Republic Services' past performance and to peers in the same industry. The period to the end of 2024 brings more of the same, according to the analysts, with revenue forecast to display 8.1% growth on an annualised basis. That is in line with its 8.9% annual growth over the past five years. Juxtapose this against our data, which suggests that other companies (with analyst coverage) in the industry are forecast to see their revenues grow 6.7% per year. So although Republic Services is expected to maintain its revenue growth rate, it's only growing at about the rate of the wider industry."", ""The most obvious conclusion is that there's been no major change in the business' prospects in recent times, with the analysts holding their earnings forecasts steady, in line with previous estimates. There was also an upgrade to revenue estimates, although as we saw earlier, forecast growth is only expected to be about the same as the wider industry. We note an upgrade to the price target, suggesting that the analysts believes the intrinsic value of the business is likely to improve over time."", ""With that said, the long-term trajectory of the company's earnings is a lot more important than next year.

(You can read Fortune’s full feature about Boeing's travails here.) But shortly after that cataclysm, the U.S. Department of Justice gave an extra tug on the straps, and possibly made it tougher for Boeing to free the arms lashed behind its back. Though little noted at the time, Boeing's 10-K, filed on Jan. 31, disclosed that the DOJ is reviewing the deferred prosecution agreement (DPA) that it signed with Boeing in early 2021 following two of the half-dozen deadliest crashes in the past decade, the Lion Air and Ethiopian Airlines disasters in late 2018 and early 2019, respectively, that claimed the lives of 346 passengers and crew flying aboard Boeing 737 Max jets."", ""As part of the pact, Boeing agreed to pay $2.5 billion in fines and damages divided among the DOJ, the airline customers hobbled by the Max's almost two-year grounding, and the victims' families and heirs. The DOJ also hit Boeing with criminal charges for concealing problems with the new flight control system that caused the tragedies, but effectively agreed not to prosecute if, for the following three years, Boeing would substantially strengthen its safety and compliance programs and provide thorough and accurate data on its aircraft designs and production processes. Put simply, the deal left Boeing vulnerable to a new DOJ crackdown if it screwed up again."", 'The blowout heard round the world amounted to an open invitation for the DOJ to examine whether lax safety procedures the pact was supposed to fix triggered the new disaster. In late February, Bloomberg, the New York Times, CNN, and other outlets independently reported confirmation from anonymous sources that the DOJ and the U.S. Attorney in Seattle are investigating whether Boeing had breached the agreement. (Boeing hasn\'t commented, and the DOJ wrote Fortune in an email, ""Decline to comment."") If the department finds that the planemaker violated the pact, it can extend the restrictions already in place or impose new strictures that would further curb Boeing\'s freedom of action and also impose big fines.', 'The threat of a new DOJ clampdown is hardly the only menace Boeing is facing. On Feb. 26 the FAA issued a sharply critical report slamming Boeing\'s safety culture as ""inadequate and confusing,"" noting a ""disconnect"" between senior management and the manufacturing personnel on ensuring safeguards. The following day, the agency gave the planemaker a 90-day deadline to develop a comprehensive plan to address ""systemic quality-control issues."" The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), the agency that investigates airline accidents, is conducting a probe that it says will last 12 to 18 months into what caused the mid-flight debacle. In a preliminary report, the NTSB found that Boeing workers removed the panel at the 737 plant in Renton, Wash., but didn\'t reinstall four bolts when they replaced the two-by-four-foot assemblage, so that Air Alaska received the aircraft without the securing bolts in place.', ""The regulatory onslaught goes well beyond investigations and audits and to the heart of Boeing's operations. The FAA has installed dozens of inspectors in Renton overseeing all aspects of its 737 production. And the watchdog has temporarily capped production of the 737 Max at 38 per month, far below the target of 50 Boeing planned to reach by 2025 or 2026. It also required that Boeing put on hold its blueprint for a Max assembly line at its Everett, Wash., factory that was central to ramping up future production of the bestselling aircraft."", ""Here's why the possibility of a new DOJ haymaker is especially concerning: Despite all the other regulatory woes and 737 production limits, Boeing's financial fortunes appeared on the upswing. That's the view its leaders are selling hard. During the Q4 earnings call on Jan. 31, CEO David Calhoun predicted that Boeing would lift its free cash flow to $10 billion by 2025 or 2026. Indeed, after already bouncing from huge post-crashes and COVID losses, it managed to garner $4.4 billion in free cash flow for 2023."", ""Now the big question is whether all the regulators pulling on the buckles and loops of Boeing's straitjacket, with a potential yank from Justice to come, will seriously delay what looked like the start of strong comeback."", 'Prior to the Air Alaska catastrophe, Boeing appeared en route to at least approximating its fantastic run prior to the two fatal crashes. In an extraordinary ascent from the close of 2010 to early 2019, it proved masterful at working the lever that more than any other drives share prices higher: generating bigger and bigger profits on each dollar it added in capital.', 'From the start of 2010 to the close of 2018, Boeing grew its adjusted assets from $78 billion to $135 billion, or 71%, according to a measure called COROA, or ""cash operating return on assets,"" developed by noted accountant Jack Ciesielski. But its ""operating cash flow"" exploded almost fivefold, or by 400%, from $3.6 billion to $17.1 billion. The magic? Boeing generated 22 cents in extra cash flow from every $1 in new assets. By early 2019, it had tripled its COROA from 4.6% to 12.1%. For 2018, its COROA (cash generated by all the assets such as inventory, PP&E, and goodwill still deployed in the business) exceeded those of virtually every big industrial name, including Honeywell, Lockheed Martin, Danaher, and Northrop Grumman.', 'Its share price followed the liftoff in profitability. From the end of 2010 through March 2019, Boeing notched an annualized total return of 29.5%, easily beating Microsoft (21.7%), Apple (19.6%), and Alphabet (18%), not to mention the S&P 500 at 14%. In those eight years, its stock vaulted sixfold from $73 to $364.', 'But from 2019 to 2022, as safety problems hidden for years erupted into the accidents and delays that hammered its results, Boeing suffered one of the most sudden, dramatic reversals in corporate history. In those three years, it suffered $21 billion in GAAP net losses, and its COROA, our return on asset metric, swung from over 12% to an annual average of negative 4.2%. Its stock followed suit, collapsing since the peak in early 2019 to $201 on March 1, a drop of 45% that erased $100 billion in market cap.', ""Even if Boeing achieves the goal that management predicts by reaching $10 billion in free cash flow by 2025 or 2026, that figure would still lag the peak of $13.6 billion posted in 2018. But if this colossus can really get there, its stock looks like a bargain. Shares would be selling at just 10 times projected free cash flow in as little as two years. That its valuation remains so depressed speaks to the market's serious doubts Boeing can deliver on that number."", 'As Ron Epstein, an analyst for Bank of America, told CNBC on Feb. 29, ""Number one for the company will be quality compliance and culture; that stuff comes first. This investigation plus the FAA and NTSB are pushing back its goals. The financial targets will have to come later.""', ""The regulatory house arrest that just got a potentially new guardian, the DOJ, makes the $10 billion target a much longer haul. Boeing enjoys the most singular advantage of virtually any major company. It shares with European consortium Airbus what's essentially a global duopoly in a giant business, the production and sales of large commercial aircraft. The two capture practically every order in a fast-growing field whose rapid advance is ensured as growing global wealth and raw demographics inevitably swell the world's hunger for air travel."", ""That business model's the envy of any manufacturer, and in the pre-crash years, Boeing showed just how incredibly profitable it could prove. Then Boeing's self-inflicted mistakes staggered one of the world's greatest cash machines. As long as the regulators, including an unforeseen extension of the DOJ guardrails, keep their grip on Boeing, expect its results to be delayed at the gate, instead of cruising at 35,000 feet."", 'This story was originally featured on Fortune.com']"

When considering valuation metrics, the price-to-earnings ratio has always been the obvious choice. This is because calculations based on earnings are easy and come in handy. However, the price-to-sales ratio is convenient for determining the value of stocks that are incurring losses or in an early development cycle, generating meager or no profit.', ""While a loss-making company with a negative price-to-earnings ratio falls out of investor favor, its price-to-sales can indicate the hidden strength of the business. This underrated ratio is also used to identify a recovery situation or ensure a company's growth is not overvalued.A stock’s price-to-sales ratio reflects how much investors pay for each dollar of revenue generated by a company.If the price-to-sales ratio is 1, investors are paying $1 for every $1 of revenues generated by the company. A stock with a price-to-sales below 1 is a good bargain as investors need to pay less than a dollar for a dollar’s worth. \xa0Thus, a stock with a lower price-to-sales ratio is a more suitable investment than a stock with a high price-to-sales ratio.The price-to-sales ratio is often preferred over price-to-earnings, as companies can manipulate their earnings using various accounting measures. However, sales are harder to manipulate and are relatively reliable.However, one should keep in mind that a company with a high debt and a low price-to-sales ratio is not an ideal choice. The high debt level will have to be paid off at some point, leading to further share issuance, a rise in market cap, and, ultimately, a higher price-to-sales ratio.In any case, the price-to-sales ratio used in isolation cannot do the trick. One should analyze other ratios like Price/Earnings, Price/Book and Debt/Equity before arriving at any investment decision.Molson Coors TAP, PagSeguro Digital PAGS, Cigna Group CI, State Street STT and First Horizon FHN are some companies with a low price-to-sales ratio and the potential to offer higher returns."", ""Price to Sales less than the Median Price to Sales for its Industry: The lower the price-to-sales ratio, the better.Price to Earnings using F(1) estimate less than the Median Price to Earnings for its Industry: The lower, the better.Price to Book (common Equity) less than the Median Price to Book for its Industry: This is another parameter to ensure the value feature of a stock.Debt to Equity (Most Recent) less than the Median Debt to Equity for its Industry: A company with less debt should have a stable price-to-sales ratio.Current Price greater than or equal to $5: The stocks must be trading at a minimum of $5 or higher.Zacks Rank less than or equal to #2 (Buy): Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 stocks are known to outperform, irrespective of the market environment.Value Score less than or equal to B: Our research shows that stocks with a Value Score of A or B, when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 or 2, offer the best opportunities in the value investing space.Here are five of the 16 stocks that qualified the screening:Molson Coors is one of the largest brewers in the world and boasts a strong portfolio of well-established brands.

Per this deal, Lockheed will provide recurring logistics support to aid the F-35 Lightning II Joint Strike Fighter Air Systems’ sustainment efforts.These logistics support includes ground maintenance activities, action request resolution, depot activation activities, automatic logistics information system operations and maintenance, reliability, and maintainability, supply-chain management, pilot and maintainer training, and training system sustainment.A major portion of work related to this deal will be executed in Fort Worth, TX.', ""F-35 is the most lethal, survivable and connected fighter jet in the world.

Nike in December lowered its sales guidance for fiscal year 2024 and JD Sports in January lowered its full-year profit outlook.', '“Amid all these negative data points in the industry, it’s somewhat of a head-scratcher why Foot Locker would be bucking the trend and would be putting up better-than-expected Q4 sales,” Nikic said.', 'According to pricing data from UBS, Foot Locker increased its promotional activity in Q4, likely in an effort to drive more sales. UBS also noted that web traffic at Foot Locker and its WSS and Champs brands has slowed, which is a “sign of lagging brand heat and will contribute to lower-than-expected sales growth rates going forward,” UBS analyst Jay Sole said in a note last week. He also noted that Foot Locker is competing against top brands like Nike who are more focused on their direct channels for distribution.', '“Over the last few years, Foot Locker has closed its Footaction, Eastbay, Runner’s Point, Sidestep, Lady Foot Locker, and its Asia business. Plus, its Champs business is set to close many of its stores,” Sole wrote. “We expect the trend to continue as market share continues to shift to brands.”', 'BTIG analyst Janine Stichter echoed this sentiment in a note last week explaining how a reduction in Nike product could slow Foot Locker’s growth plan. Giving the stock a Neutral rating, she said “while we are overall positive on the strategy CEO Mary Dillon is in the process of executing, there remain many uncertainties that make the recovery path likely to be non-linear.”', 'In a broader sense, Williams Trading analyst Sam Poser attributed Foot Locker’s potential challenges to a general “lack of focus” and loss of Nike product in a note last week, where he lowered his estimate on the stock. Rather than focusing on international expansion and digital consumer engagement, Poser said Foot Locker needs to get back its basics and rethink core elements like store distribution and basic digital infrastructure.', '“Foot Locker will continue to lose share to JD/Finish Line, Hibbett, Dick’s Sporting Goods and others,” Poser said, noting that the company is relying too heavily on a historic model that hasn’t evolved enough.', 'Best of Footwear News', ""The Greatest Super Bowl Shoe Commercials of All Time: From Nike's 1993 'Hare Jordan' to Skechers' Snoop Dogg Ad"", 'Skechers Super Bowl Ads Through the Years: Kim Kardashian, Willie Nelson, Snoop Dogg and More', ""Nike's Tiger Woods Building: Everything to Know About the Two-Story Conference Center Built in 2001""]"

SMCI and Deckers Outdoor Corporation DECK will join the S&P 500 Index, replacing ZION and Whirlpool Corporation WHR, effective Mar 18.ZION and WHR will be joining the S&P Midcap 400 Index.Super Micro is a maker of high-end servers that are used in artificial intelligence applications, whereas Deckers is a footwear manufacturer.After an almost 240% rally in 2023, shares of SMCI have gained more than 200% so far this year as the ecstasy for disruptive technologies has fueled the demand for its servers. Also, the Deckers Outdoor stock has rallied more than 35% this year.With the inclusion of SMCI and DECK in the S&P 500 Index, more importance will be given to the technology and consumer discretionary sectors, with less weight given to the industrial and financial sectors.Notably, the S&P 500 Index is a market-cap-weighted index, which means that with bigger market capitalization, a company will have more influence on the index.In this case, Super Micro’s market cap is approximately $51 billion, which is much above the combined market caps of Whirlpool and ZION.The S&P Dow Jones Indices stated, “The changes ensure each index is more representative of its market capitalization range. All companies being added to the S&P 500 are more representative of the large-cap market space, while all companies being added to the S&P MidCap 400 are more representative of the mid-cap market space.”Looking at ZION, the company, like most of its regional banking peers, has been suffering because of its sizeable exposure to commercial real estate (CRE) loans. As of Dec 31, 2023, ZION’s exposure to commercial loans was 76.1%.And, since the demand for such loans is gradually waning amid a challenging operating backdrop, the asset quality of these loan categories will likely deteriorate in case of an economic slowdown. This is expected to hurt ZION’s profitability.In 2023, shares of ZION lost 10.8%. The stock has declined 11.6% so far in 2024.Amid the rapidly increasing interest rate environment, defaults on CRE loans climbed to 14-year highs last year. Weakness in the CRE lending industry has added to the woes of regional banks like ZION (as these have relatively more exposure to bad loans than their bigger rivals), which have already been struggling with unrealized losses.It is also worth noting that following the regional bank failures, Zions’ long-term issuer rating has been lowered to Baa2 from Baa1 by Moody’s as high level of unrealized losses in available-for-sale and held-to-maturity securities portfolios, and a relatively low level of capitalization pose major headwinds.Over the past six months, ZION shares have gained 7.3% compared with the industry’s 9.7% growth.', 'Image Source: Zacks Investment Research', 'Currently, ZION carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

You can skip our detailed analysis of the pharma sector and its performance, and go directly to read 5 Best Pharma Dividend Stocks To Buy in 2024.\xa0', 'Within the healthcare industry in the US, the pharmaceutical sector has experienced significant transformations in recent times. These changes include the influence of the COVID-19 pandemic, the formation of collaborations spanning the entire value chain, and a continuously evolving regulatory landscape. The US pharmaceutical market is the largest in the world, both in terms of revenue and innovation. It plays a crucial role in global healthcare and pharmaceutical research and development. According to S&P Global Ratings, major pharmaceutical companies collectively earned around $700 billion in revenue during 2023, which includes some additional revenue sources beyond pharmaceuticals. This amount constitutes over half of the estimated $1.1 trillion global pharmaceutical market. Moreover, the US accounts for approximately 40% to 50% of the total revenues in the global pharmaceutical industry. The US market is particularly appealing to branded pharmaceutical companies due to substantially higher prices and profit margins compared to other regions.', ""Beyond the financial returns of the pharmaceutical industry in the US, its innovation stands out on the global stage. In recent times, there have been significant advancements in vaccine development, cancer treatments, GLP-1 drugs for managing obesity, gene therapy, gene editing technology for rare diseases, and novel treatments for complex illnesses such as Alzheimer’s disease. However, despite these achievements, the sector grapples with a persistent value problem, leaving investors dissatisfied. Relative to market indices, the pharmaceutical sector continues to underperform in capital markets. The reason for this could be that in 2023, the healthcare field in the US encountered challenging circumstances, marked by persistently high inflation rates, shortages in labor, and the ongoing prevalence of COVID-19. The S&P 500 Pharmaceuticals Select Industry Index, which monitors the performance of pharmaceutical companies, showed a total return of 2.77% for the year, in contrast to the 25.4% return of the broader market. That said, it's worth noting that the pharmaceutical branch did not experience as much decline as other sectors like consumer staples and utilities."", ""One significant factor contributing to the stability of the pharmaceutical area is the active pursuit by pharmaceutical companies to acquire innovative biotech firms through a series of smaller acquisitions, rather than pursuing large-scale mergers. This strategy helps them address potential gaps in their product pipelines more effectively. In a recent development, Novartis AG (NYSE:NVS) has reached an agreement to acquire MorphoSys AG (NASDAQ:MOR), a move aimed at obtaining an experimental medicine for blood cancer that complements Novartis's existing portfolio. This acquisition is among six deals valued at over $1 billion that have been announced just this year, as reported by Bloomberg."", ""The healthcare sector's lackluster performance in 2023 hasn't dampened the enthusiasm of analysts. Healthcare investors and analysts are unexpectedly optimistic about the outlook. Although few anticipate rapid or explosive growth, and certain segments are more favorable than others, there's a prevailing sentiment that the healthcare sector as a whole is poised for a resurgence. Ziad Bakri, a portfolio manager at T. Rowe Price, discussed the outlook for the sector with Barron's this year. Here are some comments from the analyst:"", '“Everyone worries about these stocks in election years, and I feel like we’ve [already] taken a lot of pain. Most of the sub-sectors are pretty well set up for next year.”', 'Mr. Bakri also addressed the impact of GLP-1 weight loss medications, which triggered sell-offs in the medical devices sector. The rationale behind this was the belief that these medications would reduce the necessity for various medical procedures and devices. According to Bakri, many of these stocks have only partially recovered from their losses related to GLP-1. He anticipates that concerns regarding GLP-1 will continue to affect the stocks, but he also mentioned that there may be a growing understanding in the market that the effects will be more prolonged, particularly if interest rates decrease.', 'Pfizer Inc.

You can also take a detailed look at the 5 Countries with Most Credit Card Debt in the World.', 'The use of credit cards has become increasingly prevalent, shaping the financial behaviors of individuals and economies worldwide. As consumers seek convenience and flexibility in their transactions, credit card usage has soared, leading to a significant rise in the levels of credit card debt across the globe. This trend highlights a complex interplay between consumer spending habits, economic factors, and financial policies that have profound implications for individuals, businesses, and governments alike.', 'According to data from the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis (FRED) and the Bank for International Settlements (BIS), the global use of credit cards has been on the rise in recent years. In fact, the total number of credit cards in circulation worldwide reached an astounding 6.8 billion in 2020, representing a significant increase from previous years. This surge in credit card usage can be attributed to several factors. Firstly, advancements in technology and the digitization of financial services have made it easier than ever for consumers to access credit. With the advent of online banking and mobile payment platforms, individuals can now apply for credit cards and make transactions with just a few taps on their smartphones. Additionally, the widespread adoption of credit cards by sellers and retailers has further incentivized their use, as consumers are often offered exclusive discounts and rewards for using plastic over cash.', 'However, the rise in credit card usage has also brought about a corresponding increase in credit card debt. As consumers embrace the convenience of credit cards, many find themselves caught in a cycle of overspending and debt accumulation. According to data from TransUnion, the total amount of credit card debt worldwide exceeded $1 trillion in 2020, highlighting the magnitude of the issue. Macroeconomic factors also play a significant role in driving credit card debt levels. In countries such as Japan and Sweden, where interest rates are low and access to credit is abundant, consumers may be more inclined to borrow and spend freely.', 'Furthermore, the COVID-19 pandemic has exacerbated the issue of credit card debt in many countries, as individuals struggle to cope with job losses, income instability, and rising living costs. According to a study conducted by the World Bank, the pandemic-induced economic downturn resulted in a 20% increase in credit card debt worldwide in 2020, compared to the previous year. This trend shows the vulnerability of households to financial shocks and highlights the urgent need for policymakers to address the root causes of credit card debt.', 'In the corporate world, credit card debt can also impact public companies, especially those in the financial sector. Companies that issue credit cards, such as Visa Inc. (NYSE:V), Mastercard Incorporated (NYSE:MA), and PayPal Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:PYPL), are exposed to the risk of default and delinquency among cardholders. Additionally, these companies rely on transaction fees and interest charges generated from credit card usage for their revenue. Therefore, fluctuations in credit card debt levels can significantly impact their financial performance and stock prices.', 'Visa Inc. (NYSE:V), one of the largest global payment technology companies, reported a total revenue of $23 billion in fiscal year 2020, with a significant portion of its revenue derived from credit card transactions. Similarly, Mastercard Incorporated (NYSE:MA), another major player in the payment processing industry, reported a total revenue of $15 billion in the same period. PayPal Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:PYPL) a leading online payments platform, reported a total revenue of $21 billion in fiscal year 2020, with credit card transactions contributing to a significant portion of its revenue.', 'Overall, all these companies: Visa Inc. (NYSE:V), Mastercard Incorporated (NYSE:MA), and PayPal Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:PYPL) play a crucial role in the credit card ecosystem, facilitating billions of transactions and generating significant revenue from credit card payments. While their business models are inherently tied to consumer spending and credit card usage, they also face risks associated with rising credit card debt levels and changing market dynamics. As such, these companies must continue to innovate and adapt to evolving consumer preferences and regulatory requirements to maintain their competitive edge in the payments industry.', ""Let's now head over to the list of the 20 countries with the most credit card debt in the world."", 'To shortlist the 20 Countries with Most Credit Card Debt in the World, we consulted credible sources like Card Rates, TransUnion, Finder, and Federal Reserve Survey of Consumer Finances to gain information on the use of credit cards in different countries. We used Card Rates’s data of average credit card debt for each country, as of late 2023. For countries whose data was not mentioned on that platform, other aforementioned sources were used to derive the data. All data was converted to USD to maintain uniformity and to ensure fair ranking.', 'By the way, Insider Monkey is an investing website that tracks the movements of corporate insiders and hedge funds.

With a median credit card debt of $1,534, many Irish households rely on credit cards to manage their finances. Despite efforts by the government and financial institutions to promote responsible borrowing, the ease of obtaining credit cards and the allure of rewards and cashback incentives often lead to overspending. Economic fluctuations, such as the housing market crash of the late 2000s, have also contributed to debt accumulation as individuals may turn to credit cards to cover unexpected expenses. However, increased financial literacy programs and debt management services aim to educate consumers about the pitfalls of excessive credit card use and encourage responsible financial behaviors among the Irish population.', 'Median Credit Card Debt: $1,604', 'Canada is 19th on the list of 20 countries with the most credit card debt. The credit card debt here remains a significant financial concern for many households. Factors such as rising living costs, stagnant wage growth, and increasing reliance on credit for daily expenses contribute to the accumulation of credit card debt. Additionally, low minimum monthly payments and high-interest rates can trap individuals in a cycle of debt, making it challenging to repay balances in full. Efforts by financial regulators and consumer advocacy groups aim to address these issues by promoting financial literacy, advocating for fair lending practices, and providing resources for debt management and repayment strategies.', 'Median Credit Card Debt: $1,616', 'Despite its reputation for prudent financial management, France faces challenges related to credit card debt among its citizens. With a median credit card debt of $1,616, French households grapple with the temptation of easy credit and the allure of consumer goods and services.

With a median credit card debt of $1,728, Chinese consumers face challenges associated with managing their finances in a rapidly changing economic landscape.

However, inadequate financial education and a lack of understanding about credit card terms and interest rates contribute to debt accumulation among individuals. Moreover, cultural factors such as the desire to maintain appearances and social status may drive overspending and lead to financial difficulties. To address these issues initiatives to promote financial literacy, regulate lending practices, and provide resources for debt management and counselling services are being taken."", 'Median Credit Card Debt: $1,795', 'Austria, known for its stable economy and high quality of life, also grapples with credit card debt among its citizens. With a median credit card debt of $1,795, Austrian households navigate the challenges of managing finances in a modern consumer-driven society.

High-interest rates and fees can quickly accumulate, leading to financial strain for individuals and families. Economic factors such as unemployment or unexpected expenses can further exacerbate debt problems, making it challenging for individuals to regain financial stability. Efforts to promote financial literacy, regulate lending practices, and provide support for debt management aim to empower consumers to make informed financial decisions and achieve long-term financial well-being.', 'Median Credit Card Debt: $1,795', 'In Belgium, credit card debt is a common financial concern among its citizens. With a median credit card debt of $1,795, many Belgians rely on credit cards for daily expenses and larger purchases. While credit cards offer convenience and flexibility, they also present risks when mismanaged. Overspending, high-interest rates, and fees can quickly accumulate, leading to financial strain for individuals and families.

With a median credit card debt of $1,815, many South Korean households rely on credit cards to finance their daily expenses and lifestyle choices.

However, this has also led to challenges related to debt accumulation and financial stress among individuals and families. High-interest rates and fees associated with credit cards can exacerbate debt problems, making it difficult for individuals to repay balances and achieve financial stability. Efforts to address these issues include initiatives to promote financial literacy, regulate lending practices, and provide support for debt management and counselling services."", 'Median Credit Card Debt: $1,935', 'Hong Kong, a global financial hub, also faces challenges related to credit card debt among its residents. With a median credit card debt of $1,935, many Hong Kongers rely on credit cards for daily expenses, dining, entertainment, and travel. The convenience and purchasing power offered by credit cards make them a popular payment method. However, high living costs, coupled with low savings rates and a culture of consumerism, contribute to debt accumulation among individuals and families. Moreover, the allure of rewards programs and cashback incentives may incentivize excessive spending and lead to financial strain. To improve these issues, initiatives to promote financial education, regulate lending practices, and provide resources for debt management and financial planning to help Hong Kong residents can achieve long-term financial well-being.', 'Median Credit Card Debt: $1,964', 'Norway, known for its high standard of living and robust social welfare system, also grapples with credit card debt among its population.

With a median credit card debt of $2,052, many Germans rely on credit cards for online purchases, travel, and emergencies. However, credit card usage remains relatively low compared to other countries, with cash and debit cards being more popular payment methods. Nevertheless, rising living costs and increasing consumerism contribute to debt accumulation among individuals and families. High-interest rates and fees associated with credit cards can exacerbate financial strain, particularly for those with lower incomes or unstable employment.

Efforts to combat this issue include educational campaigns promoting financial literacy and responsible spending, as well as regulatory measures to curb predatory lending practices."", 'Median Credit Card Debt: $2,288', ""In Denmark, renowned for its progressive social policies and high quality of life, credit card debt is a pertinent financial concern. With a median credit card debt of $2,288, many Danes navigate the fine line between financial convenience and fiscal responsibility. The Danish penchant for hygge, or cozy living, often involves indulgences that may extend beyond one's means, driving credit card usage.

When considering valuation metrics, the price-to-earnings ratio has always been the obvious choice. This is because calculations based on earnings are easy and come in handy.

This underrated ratio is also used to identify a recovery situation or ensure a company's growth is not overvalued.A stock’s price-to-sales ratio reflects how much investors pay for each dollar of revenue generated by a company.If the price-to-sales ratio is 1, investors are paying $1 for every $1 of revenues generated by the company.

However, sales are harder to manipulate and are relatively reliable.However, one should keep in mind that a company with a high debt and a low price-to-sales ratio is not an ideal choice.

One should analyze other ratios like Price/Earnings, Price/Book and Debt/Equity before arriving at any investment decision.Molson Coors TAP, PagSeguro Digital PAGS, Cigna Group CI, State Street STT and First Horizon FHN are some companies with a low price-to-sales ratio and the potential to offer higher returns."", ""Price to Sales less than the Median Price to Sales for its Industry: The lower the price-to-sales ratio, the better.Price to Earnings using F(1) estimate less than the Median Price to Earnings for its Industry: The lower, the better.Price to Book (common Equity) less than the Median Price to Book for its Industry: This is another parameter to ensure the value feature of a stock.Debt to Equity (Most Recent) less than the Median Debt to Equity for its Industry: A company with less debt should have a stable price-to-sales ratio.Current Price greater than or equal to $5: The stocks must be trading at a minimum of $5 or higher.Zacks Rank less than or equal to #2 (Buy): Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 stocks are known to outperform, irrespective of the market environment.Value Score less than or equal to B: Our research shows that stocks with a Value Score of A or B, when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 or 2, offer the best opportunities in the value investing space.Here are five of the 16 stocks that qualified the screening:Molson Coors is one of the largest brewers in the world and boasts a strong portfolio of well-established brands.

When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward.

Cruise operators and travel agents report heightened interest due to the relative affordability of cruises compared to land-based alternatives. Despite cancellations in other travel sectors, cruise bookings for 2024 are anticipated to break records. With occupancy levels steadily approaching pre-pandemic levels, cruise operators are contemplating adjustments in pricing strategies to capitalize on the skyrocketing demand. However, this heightened interest in cruise vacations comes against the backdrop of cancellations and postponements of travel plans to other regions, particularly the Middle East.

Similarly, travel agencies like Marvelous Mouse Travels and InteleTravel have experienced a significant uptick in demand, surpassing pre-pandemic booking levels by considerable margins. Cruise operator Royal Caribbean observed a surge in first-time cruisers. To benefit from this opportunity, online travel companies, including Booking.com, are capitalizing on this trend, launching cruise verticals to cater to the growing demand.', 'The latest trends in the cruise industry, as highlighted by CLIA, indicate a strong focus on younger generations, with 88% of millennials and 86% of Gen-X travelers who have previously cruised expressing plans to cruise again. Additionally, there is growing interest among millennials and Gen-Xers who have never cruised, with 73% considering a cruise vacation. Similarly, solo cruise travel is on the rise, prompting cruise lines to enhance offerings for solo travelers by increasing single-cabin availability. Moreover, the commitment to environmental considerations is rising among current and potential cruise travelers, with 50% expressing increased dedication to making travel decisions based on environmental impacts. Additionally, expedition cruises are experiencing a surge in popularity, driven by the desire for immersive, responsible, and bucket-list travel experiences.

On average, the top 20 managers achieved a 10.5% gain in 2023, surpassing the industry's overall return of 6.4%. Multi-strategy hedge funds like Citadel, Millennium Management, and D. E. Shaw, known for using leverage, were the top three funds by lifetime gains. Despite representing only 4.6% of the industry's assets, these three firms generated 38.3% of the industry's returns over the past three years. Citadel, with $74 billion in gains since 1990, maintained its leading position in 2023, returning 15.3%, while also deciding to return approximately $7 billion to investors.

On the other hand, Bridgewater Associates and Caxton Associates were the only firms among the top 20 that posted losses.

A car that goes fast is fun, but many would prefer a car they know won't break down much, even if it's slower. The same reasoning can apply to 5G technology, and it's this logic that Verizon Communications (NYSE: VZ) is using to define its place in the telecom market."", ""Many wireless customers know the frustration of paying premium rates for 5G access and yet still encountering dead zones and dropped calls. Now imagine you're a multimillion-dollar company that relies on your 5G connection to manufacture goods or perform a critical task. Even a momentary loss in connection could cost an untold amount of revenue or damage your reputation. Anticipating this potential issue, Verizon invested $40 million into mobile edge computing technologies in 2022."", 'Now Verizon has begun to shine thanks to its focus on specialized private mobile edge computing (MEC) services. Private MEC offers an on-site connection for companies that outsource their data processing needs to cloud computing providers.', 'By pairing its highly reliable 5G network with a secure and integrated cloud computing network, Verizon currently has one of the most stable data processing methods on the market. Verizon also offers public MEC, which is accessible to more than one customer.', 'Yet private MEC may one day service some of the most lucrative sectors in enterprise 5G connectivity. Two examples of such applications are automated manufacturing and telehealth. While on wildly different ends of the service spectrum, both rely on robots and devices with 5G connections for successful results.', ""Starting with general telehealth, Verizon's head start in offering private MEC means it can give providers unmatched security when treating patients. That's because Verizon's private 5G network provides an encrypted end-to-end connection between the healthcare worker and the patient."", 'As such, critical medical records, test results, and overall sensitive patient information are protected, while still being accessible at low latency speeds -- even for remote patients. Plus, data processing speeds are also extremely diminished, since any medical data that needs to be stored or interpreted goes directly to the edge computing service.', 'In the case of remote surgery, Verizon\'s private MEC provides ""ultralow"" latency between remote input and on-site output. This is due to the secure connection between the site\'s surgery robot, the remote-controlling surgeon, and Verizon\'s 5G network all outsourcing the high-speed data processing to a cloud computing site.', 'For healthcare companies seeking to serve more distant patients, the prospects of telehealth and remote surgery open up new profit opportunities while lowering staffing costs. Thus, current estimates for the two markets predict a total value of $7.2 billion by 2033 for medical robotics and $285.7 billion by 2028 for telehealth.', 'In the case of automated manufacturing, robots are still involved but the stakes are lower, and the focus is production efficiency and profitability. For companies with automated production lines, private MEC networks provide a closed loop for maintenance personnel to diagnose inefficiencies.', ""Real-time data collection and review such as this offers companies using Verizon's private MEC service a level of insight into production like never before. It also helps significantly protect companies that rely on automation for critical manufacturing -- such as defense contractors -- from cyberattacks. Moreover, the automation industry has been mostly held back by latency issues, and Verizon's specialized private MEC nearly eliminates this issue. Once the latency issues are resolved, analysts predict the industrial automation market could potentially reach $115 billion by 2025."", ""While it's unlikely Verizon will remain the sole offering for individualized private MECs, its head start means it'll iron out many of the early issues its competitors will soon face. It also means Verizon has the chance to make the best first impressions with its MEC and build lasting relationships so long as its network remains reliable. Even if the company focused on marketing MECs solely to hospitals and factories, the growth potential is massive.

Deckers has gained 35.1% since the start of the year compared to the 3.3% move for the Zacks Retail-Wholesale sector and the 14.5% return for the Zacks Retail - Apparel and Shoes industry.', ""What's Driving the Outperformance?"", ""The stock has an impressive record of positive earnings surprises, as it hasn't missed our earnings consensus estimate in any of the last four quarters. In its last earnings report on February 1, 2024, Deckers reported EPS of $15.11 versus consensus estimate of $11.4."", 'For the current fiscal year, Deckers is expected to post earnings of $26.85 per share on $4.2 billion in revenues. This represents a 38.62% change in EPS on a 15.7% change in revenues. For the next fiscal year, the company is expected to earn $29.71 per share on $4.64 billion in revenues. This represents a year-over-year change of 10.64% and 10.68%, respectively.', 'Valuation Metrics', 'Deckers may be at a 52-week high right now, but what might the future hold for the stock? A key aspect of this question is taking a look at valuation metrics in order to determine if the company is due for a pullback from this level.', 'On this front, we can look at the Zacks Style Scores, as these give investors a variety of ways to comb through stocks (beyond looking at the Zacks Rank of a security). These styles are represented by grades running from A to F in the categories of Value, Growth, and Momentum, while there is a combined VGM Score as well. Investors should consider the style scores a valuable tool that can help you to pick the most appropriate Zacks Rank stocks based on their individual investment style.', ""Deckers has a Value Score of D. The stock's Growth and Momentum Scores are A and D, respectively, giving the company a VGM Score of B."", ""In terms of its value breakdown, the stock currently trades at 33.6X current fiscal year EPS estimates, which is a premium to the peer industry average of 15.6X. On a trailing cash flow basis, the stock currently trades at 43.1X versus its peer group's average of 8.6X. Additionally, the stock has a PEG ratio of 1.77. This isn't enough to put the company in the top echelon of all stocks we cover from a value perspective."", 'Zacks Rank', ""We also need to consider the stock's Zacks Rank, as this supersedes any trend on the style score front. Fortunately, Deckers currently has a Zacks Rank of #1 (Strong Buy) thanks to favorable earnings estimate revisions from covering analysts."", 'Since we recommend that investors select stocks carrying Zacks Rank of 1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) and Style Scores of A or B, it looks as if Deckers meets the list of requirements. Thus, it seems as though Deckers shares could have a bit more room to run in the near term.', 'How Does DECK Stack Up to the Competition?', 'Shares of DECK have been soaring, and the company still appears to be a decent choice, but what about the rest of the industry? One industry peer that looks good is Tapestry, Inc. (TPR). TPR has a Zacks Rank of # 2 (Buy) and a Value Score of A, a Growth Score of B, and a Momentum Score of B.', 'Earnings were strong last quarter. Tapestry, Inc. beat our consensus estimate by 12.41%, and for the current fiscal year, TPR is expected to post earnings of $4.23 per share on revenue of $6.75 billion.', 'Shares of Tapestry, Inc. have gained 18% over the past month, and currently trade at a forward P/E of 11.17X and a P/CF of 9.79X.', 'The Retail - Apparel and Shoes industry may rank in the bottom 60% of all the industries we have in our universe, but there still looks like there are some nice tailwinds for DECK and TPR, even beyond their own solid fundamental situation.', 'Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Cramer said while there are some companies in the industry that are “over inflated” not all AI companies are bubbles. Cramer reiterated his bullish take on NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) and said the stock is undervalued. Cramer said you have to have a historical context to understand and analyze Nvidia. He said that last year NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) stock was apparently overvalued based on the Wall Street’s earnings estimates.

Manufacturing those chips is another story. Today, there's only one viable option for manufacturing AI chips using the most advanced process. TSMC is the foundry market leader, and it has a significant technological lead over its competitors."", 'This situation is set to change in 2025 as Intel (NASDAQ: INTC) enters the foundry market in earnest.

Do GPUs remain the dominant method to train and run AI models? Intel could potentially manufacture them. Do custom AI chips proliferate? Intel could manufacture those as well.

But that's for good reason. The demand for Nvidia's graphics processing units (GPUs) has been off the charts, as highlighted by Nvidia's 265% year-over-year revenue growth in Q4 of fiscal year 2024.

However, Alphabet is the cheapest stock on this list, trading at 20.3 times forward earnings."", ""That's cheaper than the 20.4 times forward earnings the S&P 500 trades at, making Alphabet a cheaper stock than the broader market. That's an absolute bargain, making it a fantastic buy."", ""Meta Platforms has turned its business around after struggling in late 2022. Like Alphabet, its advertising wing has turned itself around, driving revenue growth of 25% in Q4. Wall Street analysts project another strong 2024, projecting 17% revenue growth. With the stock trading at 25 times forward earnings, it's not the cheapest, but it's still a solid buy at that price point."", 'Lastly is Tesla, which I may consider swapping with Nvidia. Tesla has been whacked since 2024 began, falling nearly 20%.', ""Some of this concern comes from falling margins and slowing revenue growth.

For the 12 months ended Jan. 28, Nvidia generated $27 billion in free cash flow -- a more than sevenfold increase compared to the prior year."", ""The company is aggressively deploying its capital, and a new investment in robotics start-up Figure AI is Nvidia's latest move in its calculated chess game to outmaneuver the competition. Let's break down what Figure AI does and why Nvidia may be so keen to get involved in the emerging robotics market."", 'Figure AI is a start-up that is developing humanoid robots. The company believes robotics will play a crucial role in automating everyday life. For example, robotics has the potential not only to disrupt the labor market but also to assist people in their homes with mundane tasks.', ""Last week, reports broke that Figure AI raised $675 million in venture capital (VC)\xa0funding at a $2.6 billion valuation.

But all jokes aside, Wall Street sees massive potential for this pocket of the AI market."", 'Goldman Sachs estimates that the total addressable market for humanoid robots could be $38 billion by 2035. To put this into context, just a year ago, the bank estimated that the market size was $6 billion. Goldman cited faster-than-anticipated progress in large language models (LLM) and accelerated investments in AI as reasoning for the more bullish forecast.', ""But Goldman isn't the only one that sees multibillion-dollar potential here. On Figure AI's website, the company outlines that robots could disrupt the labor force in a meaningful way -- from industries including manufacturing, logistics, warehousing, and retail. As robots help mitigate labor shortages, it could result in an enormous paradigm shift in the workforce by lowering the cost of goods and services."", ""I see a few reasons Nvidia may be interested in partnering with Figure AI. First, Nvidia's chips and its under-the-radar software business could play a crucial role in the further development of Figure AI bots."", ""But a more subtle reason for Nvidia's participation in the fundraise could be to simply acquire some exposure to an already established market. Humanoid robots are being developed by a host of companies -- you might just not realize it."", 'Most prominently, Tesla has been teasing investors with a robot called Optimus, which it plans to use across its gigafactories and sell to consumers and businesses more broadly in the long term. And right behind Tesla is Boston Dynamics, the developer of the canine robot BigDog and humanoid bot Atlas.', 'Lastly, while Amazon and Alibaba currently leverage less-humanlike robots for their warehouses, the broader idea is that this technology has led to incredible efficiencies as it relates to shipping and labor costs. As investment in AI continues to build momentum, I would not be surprised to see companies in all different industries worldwide begin to integrate humanoid robotics into everyday operations.', 'The investment in Figure AI comes at the heels of another investment by Nvidia, this one in voice-recognition software developer SoundHound AI. While news of these deals is not a reason alone to buy Nvidia stock, it is fun to speculate what they could represent in the long run.', 'I see the investment in Nvidia as an important move for the company as it seeks to move beyond GPUs. While its chip business will likely remain the bread and butter for the next few years, eventually, the competitive landscape will heat up, and Nvidia will need to demonstrate that it has other products and services it can market.', ""I am excited to see where Nvidia can go in the long run, given the potential of humanoid robotics, the many different industries it could disrupt globally, and the company's potential to act as one of the primary engines powering this new technology."", 'Should you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:', 'The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\xa010 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

You can skip our detailed analysis of the pharma sector and its performance, and go directly to read 5 Best Pharma Dividend Stocks To Buy in 2024.\xa0', 'Within the healthcare industry in the US, the pharmaceutical sector has experienced significant transformations in recent times. These changes include the influence of the COVID-19 pandemic, the formation of collaborations spanning the entire value chain, and a continuously evolving regulatory landscape. The US pharmaceutical market is the largest in the world, both in terms of revenue and innovation. It plays a crucial role in global healthcare and pharmaceutical research and development. According to S&P Global Ratings, major pharmaceutical companies collectively earned around $700 billion in revenue during 2023, which includes some additional revenue sources beyond pharmaceuticals. This amount constitutes over half of the estimated $1.1 trillion global pharmaceutical market. Moreover, the US accounts for approximately 40% to 50% of the total revenues in the global pharmaceutical industry. The US market is particularly appealing to branded pharmaceutical companies due to substantially higher prices and profit margins compared to other regions.', ""Beyond the financial returns of the pharmaceutical industry in the US, its innovation stands out on the global stage. In recent times, there have been significant advancements in vaccine development, cancer treatments, GLP-1 drugs for managing obesity, gene therapy, gene editing technology for rare diseases, and novel treatments for complex illnesses such as Alzheimer’s disease. However, despite these achievements, the sector grapples with a persistent value problem, leaving investors dissatisfied. Relative to market indices, the pharmaceutical sector continues to underperform in capital markets. The reason for this could be that in 2023, the healthcare field in the US encountered challenging circumstances, marked by persistently high inflation rates, shortages in labor, and the ongoing prevalence of COVID-19. The S&P 500 Pharmaceuticals Select Industry Index, which monitors the performance of pharmaceutical companies, showed a total return of 2.77% for the year, in contrast to the 25.4% return of the broader market. That said, it's worth noting that the pharmaceutical branch did not experience as much decline as other sectors like consumer staples and utilities."", ""One significant factor contributing to the stability of the pharmaceutical area is the active pursuit by pharmaceutical companies to acquire innovative biotech firms through a series of smaller acquisitions, rather than pursuing large-scale mergers. This strategy helps them address potential gaps in their product pipelines more effectively. In a recent development, Novartis AG (NYSE:NVS) has reached an agreement to acquire MorphoSys AG (NASDAQ:MOR), a move aimed at obtaining an experimental medicine for blood cancer that complements Novartis's existing portfolio. This acquisition is among six deals valued at over $1 billion that have been announced just this year, as reported by Bloomberg."", ""The healthcare sector's lackluster performance in 2023 hasn't dampened the enthusiasm of analysts. Healthcare investors and analysts are unexpectedly optimistic about the outlook. Although few anticipate rapid or explosive growth, and certain segments are more favorable than others, there's a prevailing sentiment that the healthcare sector as a whole is poised for a resurgence. Ziad Bakri, a portfolio manager at T. Rowe Price, discussed the outlook for the sector with Barron's this year. Here are some comments from the analyst:"", '“Everyone worries about these stocks in election years, and I feel like we’ve [already] taken a lot of pain. Most of the sub-sectors are pretty well set up for next year.”', 'Mr. Bakri also addressed the impact of GLP-1 weight loss medications, which triggered sell-offs in the medical devices sector. The rationale behind this was the belief that these medications would reduce the necessity for various medical procedures and devices. According to Bakri, many of these stocks have only partially recovered from their losses related to GLP-1. He anticipates that concerns regarding GLP-1 will continue to affect the stocks, but he also mentioned that there may be a growing understanding in the market that the effects will be more prolonged, particularly if interest rates decrease.', 'Pfizer Inc.

(AP) — Gov. Ron DeSantis has a new job for the man who has led Walt Disney World's government since his allies took it over — elections supervisor in Orange County, long one of Florida's most reliable sources of Democratic votes."", 'Glen Gilzean was appointed Monday by the Republican governor to oversee voting in Florida’s fifth-largest county, where more than 1.4 million residents live among the largest theme park resorts in the U.S. Just last May, Gilzean was chosen to be administrator of the Central Florida Tourism Oversight Committee after DeSantis’ allies took over the Disney World governing district.', 'Gilzean previously served as a DeSantis appointee on the Florida Commission on Ethics and was president and CEO of Central Florida Urban League.', ""The county's longtime elections supervisor Bill Cowles retired in January, about a year before his term was up. Cowles, a Democrat, was first elected in 1996 to the job, which oversees elections in Orlando and surrounding communities."", ""Gilzean didn't respond to an emailed inquiry."", ""Responding to an email, the district's office of public information said the “transition should be completed in one week,” without offering further details. As the district's administrator, Gilzean had an annual salary of $400,000. He'll earn about half that as elections supervisor."", 'In a joint statement, a group of federal and state Democratic lawmakers in the Orlando area, including U.S. Rep. Maxwell Frost, said Gilzean’s appointment was just the latest example of DeSantis naming unqualified loyalists to elected positions “so he can control every part of our state and local governments and warp our democracy to his will.”', '“Glen Gilzean is a Ron DeSantis loyalist who’s top priority seems to be making Ron DeSantis happy, not protecting the integrity of our elections,"" the Democratic lawmakers said. ""This move signals the Governor’s focus on silencing the voices of Central Florida voters as one of the most northern progressive hubs in our state. We cannot let this happen.”', ""Gilzean's new appointment comes at a time of turmoil for the district, which has seen an exodus of experienced staffers since the takeover and lots of litigation. The district provides municipal services such as firefighting, planning and mosquito control, among other things."", 'A fight between DeSantis and Disney began in 2022 after the company, facing significant internal and external pressure, publicly opposed a state law that critics have called “Don’t Say Gay.” The 2022 law bans classroom lessons on sexual orientation and gender identity in early grades and was championed by DeSantis, who used Disney as a punching bag in speeches until he suspended his presidential campaign this year.', 'As punishment, DeSantis took over the district through legislation passed by the Republican-controlled Florida Legislature and appointed a new board of supervisors, which named Gilzean as administrator.', ""Disney sued DeSantis and his appointees, claiming the company's free speech rights were violated for speaking out against the legislation. A federal judge dismissed that lawsuit in January. Disney has appealed."", 'A separate lawsuit over who controls the district is still pending in state court in Orlando.', 'In his new job, Gilzean will oversee the GOP presidential primary this month, primaries in August and the November general election. He has no previous experience running elections. Currently, five Democrats, a Republican and an independent have filed to run for elections supervisor in Orange County later this year.

It’s effectively Wall Street’s version of befriending the biggest, meanest schoolyard bully.', 'We’ve all been in this situation before. As kids, we typically grow at a similar rate to our classmates. However, some kids are built differently, like they’re destined to play middle linebacker for the Dallas Cowboys. You don’t mess with these giants. In turn, by being their friend, people tend to not mess with you either.', 'Now, it doesn’t mean you can go around with impunity and mess with other kids. But befriending the bully gives you a certain level of confidence that whatever happens at school, you’ve got someone that can take care of business.', 'InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips', 'It’s the same thing on Wall Street. These ideas probably won’t make you rich. But they should help you avoid being poor. On that note, below are intriguing stalwart stocks to buy and hold through any storm.', 'Source: rblfmr/ShutterStock.com', 'When it comes to stalwart stocks, you gotta go with Procter & Gamble (NYSE:PG). A consumer goods giant, the company benefits from a key fundamental reality. Regardless of market and/or economic conditions, people need to take showers, brush their teeth and wash their clothes, among many other activities.', 'Yes, you can go the discount route but in the end, you get what you pay for. And certain products – like toilet paper – present “issues” when you go to the bottom of the barrel. In that sense, the value-per-dollar proposition favors a common brand like P&G.', 'True, PG isn’t the most exciting play among stalwart stocks. However, what I do appreciate is the consistent growth trajectory. In the fiscal year ended June 2023, P&G posted just over $82 billion in revenue. Analysts on average anticipate 2024 and 2025 revenue to hit $84.74 billion and $88.06 billion, respectively.', 'Lastly, the company pays a solid forward dividend yield of 2.34%. Also, the payout has been increasing for the past 68 years, making PG one of the premiere stalwart stocks to buy.', 'Source: Eric Glenn / Shutterstock.com', 'In my opinion, the case for Kroger (NYSE:KR) as one of the stalwart stocks sells itself. As a grocery store giant, Kroger benefits from permanent relevance. You see, it effectively balances the price-and-quality ratio. For families looking to save, they can easily cut out food deliveries or going out to restaurants. Instead, they can cook at home and Kroger provides the ingredients they need at reasonable prices.', 'Right now, KR stock trades at a forward earnings multiple of 11.21X, below the sector median 17.56X. I’m not sure how long this discount will last. When looking at the high-side analyst estimate, Kroger may deliver earnings per share of $4.60 in the current year and $4.72 in 2025. I believe the more optimistic range is accurate simply because of economic realities.', 'Yes, circumstances appear to be steamrolling ahead thanks to a robust GDP print and recent jobs performances. However, American households have also struggled for years with high inflation and high interest rates. Something’s got to give – but that giving probably won’t happen in the grocery aisle.', 'People have to eat and that makes KR one of the top stalwart stocks.', 'Source: monticello / Shutterstock', 'Easily ranking among the best stalwart stocks to buy, Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO) enjoys a key fundamental catalyst: the namesake product is a cheap pick-me-up. Moving forward, if the economy doesn’t perform so well, I anticipate the soft-drink giant to benefit from the trade-down effect. In other words, look for consumers to trade down from expensive coffeeshop visits to buying Coca-Cola caffeinated products.', 'Analysts see good things ahead for KO stock. On average, they estimate that current year sales will eventually land at $45.77 billion. At the end of next year, sales should be just over $48 billion. However, I believe in the high-side estimates here: $46.5 billion in 2024 and $48.78 billion in 2025.', 'As I mentioned earlier, Coca-Cola should represent a beneficiary of the trade-down effect. While I understand that consumers may be enjoying a robust labor market, that circumstance might not last indefinitely.', 'Also, analysts rate KO a moderate buy with a $65.80 average price target. Combined with a forward dividend yield of 3.17% – with a payout increase track record of 63 years – Coca-Cola makes the cut for stalwart stocks to buy.', 'Source: rafapress / Shutterstock.com', 'To be quite blunt, Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) ordinarily isn’t a name you find listed among prospective stalwart stocks. Don’t get me wrong – it’s a massive technology power player. However, META represented more of a capital gains story. However, with the company announcing a dividend for the first time in its history, the narrative has shifted.', 'Fundamentally, the company benefits from its data goldmine. Yes, there are other social media platforms. None have the footprint and influence and demographic diversity (as in age group) of Meta’s Facebook. In addition, the company is expanding into many other relevant tech subsectors. Personally, I’m unsure about this whole metaverse deal. But the accoutrements – such as virtual reality headsets – is likely to be a longstanding winner.', 'Last year, Meta posted sales of $134.9 billion. Looking ahead, analysts anticipate on average that the company will print $158.21 billion in revenue this year. And the following, they believe $177.95 billion is realistic.', 'It’s hard to disagree given how influential Meta is. With an overall strong buy consensus view with a $529 price target, META is a top-tier candidate for stalwart stocks.', 'Source: photosounds / Shutterstock.com', 'A public utility firm headquartered in Chicago, Illinois, Exelon (NASDAQ:EXC) makes a compelling argument for stalwart stocks. As I’ve mentioned many times before, utilities enjoy a natural monopoly. Even if competitive sentiment existed, such feelings become quickly dashed as would-be rivals realize the enormous barriers to entry. From the business expenses themselves to steep regulatory pressures, it’s difficult to move into the space.', 'Cynically, that makes companies like Exelon entrenched. I don’t know what to say – it is what it is. When you’re looking for stalwart stocks for possible market headwinds, going the cynical route can be effective. Now, to be fair, EXC hasn’t had a great time in the market. One look at its 52-week chart tells you what you need to know.', 'If that wasn’t painful enough, analysts on average see revenue declines in 2024 and 2025. However, the high-side estimate calls for modest growth and that appears to be more accurate. Either way, the strength of Exelon lies in its consistent profitability. And that translates to its generous forward dividend yield of 4.21%.', 'Analysts also rate EXC a moderate buy with a $41 price target. Given its permanent relevance, it should be a trustworthy name.', 'Source: The Art of Pics / Shutterstock.com', 'A company that’s been in the news thanks to its investment in artificial intelligence, Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) seems like it just can’t miss. To be upfront, I’m beginning to get skeptical about the enormous interest in AI. There’s so much talk about how the machines are taking over and that we may not have jobs anymore.', 'Don’t worry. Generative AI protocols are so error prone that they’re effectively useless. There is simply no way that AI can take over people’s jobs unless these jobs are constrained into specific, predictable functions. If you have a dynamic occupation, forget about it.', 'Having said that, investors and enterprises will continue pouring resources into AI. Combined with Microsoft’s dominance in business software and PC operating systems, analysts on average are looking for the company to ring up sales of $244.26 billion in 2024 and $279.24 billion in 2025.', 'That’s a big leap from the company’s fiscal 2023 sales performance of $211.92 billion. Still, with AI mania in full bloom, it seems a solid bet for stalwart stocks.', 'Source: Golden Dayz / Shutterstock.com', 'At first glance, ConocoPhillips (NYSE:COP) might not seem an endearing idea for stalwart stocks. It is a stalwart to be sure. However, the company’s core business centers on hydrocarbon exploration and production. An upstream player in the fossil fuel industry clashes with the green ideology of renewable energy infrastructures. But one look at the stranded EV drivers in some of the coldest areas in the nation might have you rethinking this concept.', 'I’m not saying that electric vehicles are a scam or anything like that. However, I think it would be rash to label big oil as an obsolete sector. Given the tremendous energy density found in fossil fuels, it’s way too early to write off names like ConocoPhillips.

This strategy has paid big dividends by improving its returns and lowering its break-even level. At $60 oil, Chevron can grow its free cash flow by more than 10% per year through 2027. ', 'At that price point, Chevron can produce enough cash to boost its attractive dividend (currently yielding 4.3%), invest in its high-return capital program, and repurchase shares at the low end of its $10 billion-$20 billion annual target range. That repurchase level is enough to retire 3% of its outstanding shares each year. Chevron can produce an even bigger cash flow gusher at higher crude prices. For example, it could buy back stock at the high end of its range at $70 oil (enough to retire 6% of its outstanding shares each year). ', ""Chevron's other upside catalyst is its pending acquisition of Hess. That deal would enhance and extend its production and free cash flow growth outlook into the 2030s. Chevron estimates the acquisition would enable it to more than double its free cash flow by 2030 at $70 oil. While there were some concerns that Exxon might derail that deal, that might not be its rival's intent. Uncertainty about that merger has weighed on Chevron's stock. As that fades, and if oil prices remain at their current level, its shares could start rallying. "", 'Diamondback Energy has become a free cash flow machine over the past few years. The oil company generated $3.2 billion ($16.24 per share) of free cash flow last year. It returned 79% of that money to shareholders via a steadily rising base dividend, share repurchases, and variable dividends. ', ""Diamondback Energy could produce an even bigger free cash flow gusher in 2024. At $80 oil, it could generate more than $19 per share of free cash flow. That has the company trading at a free cash flow yield of more than 10%, roughly 3 times higher than the broader market (the S&P 500's free cash flow yield is 4%, while the Nasdaq's is 3%). It suggests the oil stock is dirt cheap. "", 'Meanwhile, like Chevron, Diamondback Energy inked a deal to enhance its ability to produce cash. It agreed to buy Endeavor Energy Resources in a $26 billion cash-and-stock deal. The company expects the merger will boost its free cash flow per share by 10% starting next year. Diamondback initially plans to return half its gushing cash flows to investors (through its base dividend, repurchases, and variable dividends) while retaining the other half to strengthen its already solid balance sheet. As debt comes down, it will have more cash to return to investors. ', 'Devon Energy also produces lots of cash. At $80 oil, it could generate about $3.2 billion in free cash flow this year, 20% more than last year. The main factors driving that increase are service cost deflation and a more efficient capital program. ', ""Like Diamondback, Devon trades at a dirt cheap price based on its free cash flow. The company's free cash flow yield would be around 9% at $75 oil and even higher at the current price point. "", ""That drives Devon's view that its shares are a no-brainer buy right now. As a result, it has shifted its capital return framework from an emphasis on paying variable dividends to repurchasing shares. Given its cheap price, the company could retire about 3% of its outstanding shares by completing what remains on its $3 billion share repurchase program (and 9% of the total since authorizing that buyback in late 2021). "", 'Chevron, Diamondback, and Devon Energy built their oil businesses to generate abundant free cash flow. With crude prices rising this year, they could produce even bigger cash flow gushers. That will give them more money to buy back their dirt cheap shares, which, along with other catalysts, could help drive their stock prices higher.', 'Should you invest $1,000 in Chevron right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Chevron, consider this:', 'The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\xa010 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Chevron wasn’t one of them.

Oracle litigation update: Rimini Street and Oracle have been in litigation for more than 14 years, including cases known as Rimini I and Rimini II. In 2010, Oracle filed the Rimini I case against Rimini Street in U.S. District Court. As a result of the Rimini I case with trial completed in 2015 and subsequent appeals, the U.S. court has affirmed that third-party software support is legal. The U.S. court issued a permanent injunction known as the Rimini I injunction enjoining certain activities related to the manner in which Rimini provides support on certain Oracle product lines.', ""The Rimini I injunction does not prohibit Rimini from providing support to any Oracle product line. There are no current litigation activities related to Rimini I. Subsequent to the Rimini I trial, Oracle filed and prevailed on certain claims and a content proceeding related to the Rimini I injunction. Rimini Street was fined and paid US$530,000 and settled and paid Oracle's attorney's fees and costs for US$9.7 million. In 2014, Rimini filed the Rimini II case against Oracle in the U.S. District Court. Trial occurred in 2022. While Oracle prevailed on liability for its DMCA and Lanham Act claims with no damages award, Oracle abandoned its $1.4 billion of damages claim and all non-equitable claims of prejudice on the eve of a jury trial and lost its copyright claims for a majority of product lines that issue in the case, EBS, JDE and Siebel."", ""On the remaining product lines, PeopleSoft and Database, Oracle prevailed on the migration process, the use of certain rewrite files and the use of certain automated tools, but Rimini prevailed on central crosscutting legal theories that were core at Oracle's broad infringement claims banning all Oracle product lines, such as confirming Rimini write-down and reuse its own know-how and that Oracle's licenses permit a third party like Rimini to perform updates or fixes to the same extent as the licensee. Today, there are currently three Rimini II post-trial litigation matters. One, appeal of the Rimini II findings and the Rimini II injunction before the Court of Appeals, known as the Merits Appeal. Two, a motion to further stay the Rimini II injunction pending Rimini's Merits Appeal also before the Court of Appeals."", ""And three, litigation over Oracle's requested recovery of their attorney's fees and costs related to Rimini II before the U.S. District Court. In July 2023, concurrent with the District Court's trial rulings for Rimini II, the District Court issued a permanent injunction known as the Rimini II Injunction, which, among other things, further enjoys Rimini's activities related solely to the manner in which Rimini provides support on certain Oracle product lines, which Rimini Street sought to reverse. As of this date, an administrative stay of the Rimini II Injunction is in place and the Court of Appeals has not yet issued a decision on our motion to stay the Rimini II Injunction through the appeals process. With respect to the Rimini II Merits Appeal, the Court of Appeals will hear the appeal on an expedited basis, which will include the appeal of the Rimini II Injunction."", ""Rimini's opening brief for the Rimini II Merits Appeal is due March 4, 2024, and Oracle's answering brief is due April 3, 2024. Rimini's optional reply brief is due within 21 days after service of Oracle's answering brief. The Court of Appeals has currently set the date of June 5, 2024, to hear oral arguments. On November 6, 2023, Oracle filed a motion for attorney's fees and taxable cost with the U.S. District Court, requesting attorneys' fees and taxable costs totaling approximately US$70.6 million related to the Rimini II litigation. On February 20, 2024, Rimini filed its opposition to Oracle's November 6, 2023, motion for attorneys' fees and taxable costs in the Rimini II litigation. In the opposition, Rimini argues that the District Court should deny Oracle's motion in its entirety."", ""Rimini further argues that, should the District Court award any attorney's fees to Oracle, such fees should not exceed US$14.47 million. Oracle's reply to Rimini's opposition is due by March 15, 2024, after which the matter will be taken under consideration for determination by the District Court. Rimini reserves all rights, including appellate rights with respect to the Rimini II litigation, including any award of attorneys' fees and taxable cost to Oracle. For additional information and disclosures regarding the company's litigation with Oracle, please see our disclosures in the company's annual report on Form 10-K filed today, February 28, 2024, with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. Please also note that at this time, we are still unable to provide material additional information beyond the disclosures and statements in our press releases, filings with the SEC and court filings, nor provide guidance with respect to future financial results, nor are we able to provide additional commentary related to the pending Oracle litigation and potential impacts of the Rimini II Injunction because the matters are still before various courts and the outcomes cannot be predicted."", 'Summary: We remain confident that we are continuing to take the right actions and making the right investments to accelerate growth, increase profitability, enhance shareholder value and bring our litigation with Oracle to a successful conclusion. However, if Rimini Street does not ultimately prevail in the litigation matters described above and in our SEC filings, it could have a material adverse impact on our business and financial results. Now, over to you, Michael.', 'Michael Perica: Thank you, Seth, and thank you for joining us, everyone. Q4 and fiscal 2023 results: Revenue for the fourth quarter and the full year 2023 was $112.1 million and $431.5 million, respectively, a year-over-year increase of 3.2% and 5.3%, respectively. Clients within the United States represented 51% while international clients represented 49% of total revenue for both the fourth quarter and full year 2023. Annualized recurring revenue was $432.3 million for the fourth quarter, a year-over-year increase of 2.9%. Revenue retention rate for service subscriptions, which makes up 96.4% of our revenue, was 90% with more than 79% of subscription revenue non-cancelable for at least 12 months. We note that for the full year 2023, our total revenue measures, on a constant currency basis, was negatively impacted by 0.6% due to FX movements.', 'The decline in our revenue retention rate for the year ended December 31, 2023, was due to attrition during the fourth quarter as certain clients did not renew specific subscriptions, however, in some cases, maintained or added subscriptions for other products. Our net billings during the fourth quarter of 2023 was flat to the comparable period of 2022 because record fourth quarter new client invoicing was able to offset fourth quarter retention losses. Billings for the fourth quarter were $160.7 million compared to $160.4 million for the prior year fourth quarter. For the full year 2023, billings increased 2.3% to $418.5 million. Gross margin was 61% of revenue for the fourth quarter and 62.3% for full year 2023 compared to 64.5% of revenue for the prior year fourth quarter and 62.8% for prior year 2022.', 'On a non-GAAP basis, which excludes stock-based compensation expense, gross margin was 61.5% of revenue for the fourth quarter and 62.8% for full year 2023 compared to 64.9% of revenue for the prior year fourth quarter and 63.3% for prior year 2022. Gross margin declined during the back half of 2023 as a result of continued investment in and expansion of our global engineering team needed to serve new client engagements in advance of related ratable contract revenue recognition. As noted in previous earnings calls, we are expecting continued gross margin pressure as we scale to meet new client engagements. Simultaneously, we are also working to improve gross margin by driving efficiencies and leveraging the benefits of growing global scale.', 'Operating expenses: While inflationary pressures and high costs are still persistent for skilled labor across all theaters, we continue to attract and retain key talent. Moreover, our margin performance in light of the pressures highlighted previously, underscores the advantage of our global footprint with centers of excellence in geographies where both the talent and value remain attractive compared to higher-priced talent markets. Sales and marketing expenses as a percentage of revenue was 31.2% of revenue for the fourth quarter and 33% for full year 2023 compared to 36.1% of revenue for the prior year fourth quarter and 34.9% for prior year 2022. On a non-GAAP basis, which excludes stock-based compensation expense, sales and marketing expenses as a percentage of revenue was 30.5% of revenue for the fourth quarter and 32.3% for full year 2023 compared to 35.4% of revenue for the prior year fourth quarter and 34.1% for prior year 2022.', 'General and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenue, excluding outside litigation costs, was 15.7% of revenue for the fourth quarter and 16.9% for full year 2023 compared to 16.7% of revenue for the prior year fourth quarter and 18.4% for prior year 2022. On a non-GAAP basis, which excludes stock-based compensation expense and litigation costs, G&A was 13.8% of revenue for the fourth quarter and 15.1% for full year 2023 compared to 15.6% of revenue for the prior year fourth quarter and 17% for prior year 2022. We are seeing a good year-over-year improvement in G&A spend due to some restructuring measures and the initial substantial investments that were required to develop and launch our expanded portfolio of solutions are largely completed.', ""However, G&A expenses as a percentage of revenue are expected to remain elevated compared to our peers due in large part to the ongoing cost for in-house legal and compliance teams and other costs made necessary by our ongoing Oracle litigation and compliance activities. Net outside litigation expense, which includes the Oracle settlement previously referenced, was $4.3 million for the fourth quarter and was $9.8 million for the full year 2023 compared to $12.8 million for the prior year fourth quarter and $25.3 million for prior year 2022. This year's fourth quarter included an accounting charge of $2.7 million related to the $9.7 million Oracle cash settlement that Seth discussed earlier related to the Rimini I Injunction content matter. Litigation expenses will vary quarter-to-quarter and year-to-year, depending on current litigation activity."", 'Our non-GAAP operating margin, which excludes outside litigation spend and stock-based compensation was 17.2% of revenue for the fourth quarter and 15.3% for full year 2023. Net income attributable to shareholders for the fourth quarter was $9.4 million or $0.10 per diluted share. And for the full year 2023 was $26.1 million or $0.29 per diluted share. On a non-GAAP basis, net income for the fourth quarter was $17.1 million or $0.19 per diluted share, and for the full year 2023 was $48.4 million or $0.54 per diluted share. Adjusted EBITDA, defined in our press release, was $21.3 million for the fourth quarter or 19% of revenue, and for full year 2023 was $71.9 million or 16.7% of revenue. Balance sheet: We ended the fiscal year with a cash balance of $115.4 million, plus investments of $9.8 million, consisting of short-term treasuries and U.S. government agency securities, bringing readily available cash to $125.2 million compared to $129.1 million for the prior fiscal year-end.', 'During 2023, we reduced the principal balance on our term loan from $78.3 million to $72.6 million, resulting in a year-end net cash position of $52.6 million. On a cash flow basis, for the fourth quarter, operating cash flow declined $1.1 million. And for the full year 2023, we generated $12.5 million compared to a decline of $1.9 million for the prior year fourth quarter and a positive $34.9 million for full year 2022. The year-over-year variance is due primarily to large non-recurring payments made during the first quarter to our outside litigation counsel relating to the fourth quarter 2022 Rimini II trial with Oracle and overhead restructuring charges, and during the fourth quarter, as noted, we paid $9.7 million to settle the content matter.', ""In addition, throughout 2023, we experienced lower client multiyear prepayments and related collections compared to the prior year 2022 as clients retain cash in the higher rate environment for their own short-term investment opportunities and the preservation of cash. Lastly, FX headwinds, as noted, also impacted cash flow. Deferred revenue as of December 31, 2023, was approximately $287 million compared to $300 million from the prior year fourth quarter. Backlog, which includes the sum of billed deferred revenue and non-comparable future revenue was approximately $607 million as of December 31, 2023, compared to $578 million for the prior year fourth quarter. Business outlook: The company is continuing to suspend guidance as to future financial results until there is more clarity around impacts from current litigation activity before the U.S. federal courts in the company's ongoing litigation with Oracle."", ""For additional information and disclosures regarding the company's litigation with Oracle, please see our disclosures in the company's annual report on Form 10-K filed on February 28, 2024 with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.

With its converged database capabilities, our new Globally Distributed Autonomous Database is the simplest, most functional, and most mission-critical distributed database cloud service in the world.""', ""Distributed databases can be difficult to deploy and manage due to the large number of servers deployed across multiple locations. Globally Distributed Autonomous Database eliminates this complexity by using and extending Autonomous Database's AI and ML-driven automation with automatic data distribution and shard management. Administrators can manage the distributed database as a single logical database, and use automated provisioning, tuning, scaling, patching, and security capabilities to avoid time-consuming manual tasks and potential errors. In addition, automatic database scaling per individual shard enables customers to ramp up and draw down resources to meet demand and minimize consumption and cost."", ""Additional Oracle Database EnhancementsWith Oracle's integration of generative AI across its technology stack, developers have access to new tools, including Autonomous Database Select AI, to integrate AI and ML into their applications.

Because of their employers' vested interests, these analysts issue more favorable ratings than their research would support, misguiding investors far more often than helping them."", 'In contrast, the Zacks Rank is driven by earnings estimate revisions. And near-term stock price movements are strongly correlated with trends in earnings estimate revisions, according to empirical research.', 'Furthermore, the different grades of the Zacks Rank are applied proportionately across all stocks for which brokerage analysts provide earnings estimates for the current year. In other words, at all times, this tool maintains a balance among the five ranks it assigns.', ""Another key difference between the ABR and Zacks Rank is freshness.

This means the annual payment is 2.1% of the current stock price, which is above the average for the industry."", ' See our latest analysis for Fidelity National Information Services ', ""Impressive dividend yields are good, but this doesn't matter much if the payments can't be sustained. Before making this announcement, Fidelity National Information Services' dividend was higher than its profits, but the free cash flows quite comfortably covered it. Healthy cash flows are always a positive sign, especially when they quite easily cover the dividend."", 'According to analysts, EPS should be several times higher next year. If recent patterns in the dividend continue, we could see the payout ratio reaching 51% which is fairly sustainable.', ""Although the company has a long dividend history, it has been cut at least once in the last 10 years. The annual payment during the last 10 years was $0.88 in 2014, and the most recent fiscal year payment was $1.44. This works out to be a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of approximately 5.0% a year over that time. A reasonable rate of dividend growth is good to see, but we're wary that the dividend history is not as solid as we'd like, having been cut at least once."", ""With a relatively unstable dividend, it's even more important to see if earnings per share is growing. Over the past five years, it looks as though Fidelity National Information Services' EPS has declined at around 19% a year. Such rapid declines definitely have the potential to constrain dividend payments if the trend continues into the future. On the bright side, earnings are predicted to gain some ground over the next year, but until this turns into a pattern we wouldn't be feeling too comfortable."", ""In summary, dividends being cut isn't ideal, however it can bring the payment into a more sustainable range. The payments haven't been particularly stable and we don't see huge growth potential, but with the dividend well covered by cash flows it could prove to be reliable over the short term. This company is not in the top tier of income providing stocks."", ""It's important to note that companies having a consistent dividend policy will generate greater investor confidence than those having an erratic one. Still, investors need to consider a host of other factors, apart from dividend payments, when analysing a company.

Investors adopting the GARP approach prefer stocks priced below the market or any reasonable target determined by fundamental analysis. The stocks have solid prospects based on cash flow, revenues, EPS, etc.Growth MetricsA strong earnings growth history and impressive earnings prospects are the primary concepts that GARP investors borrow from the growth investing strategy. However, instead of super-normal rates, pursuing stocks with a more stable and reasonable growth rate is a tactic of GARP investors. The GARP strategy considers growth rates between 10% and 30% ideal.Another metric considered by growth and GARP investors is the return on equity (ROE). GARP investors look for strong and higher ROE than the industry average to identify superior stocks. Moreover, stocks with a positive cash flow find precedence under the GARP plan.Value MetricsGARP investing prioritizes one of the popular value metrics — the price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio.

While a well funded company may sustain losses for years, it will need to generate a profit eventually, or else investors will move on and the company will wither away.', 'In contrast to all that, many investors prefer to focus on companies like Martin Marietta Materials (NYSE:MLM), which has not only revenues, but also profits. Even if this company is fairly valued by the market, investors would agree that generating consistent profits will continue to provide Martin Marietta Materials with the means to add long-term value to shareholders.', ' View our latest analysis for Martin Marietta Materials ', ""Generally, companies experiencing growth in earnings per share (EPS) should see similar trends in share price. So it makes sense that experienced investors pay close attention to company EPS when undertaking investment research. Impressively, Martin Marietta Materials has grown EPS by 19% per year, compound, in the last three years. As a general rule, we'd say that if a company can keep up that sort of growth, shareholders will be beaming."", ""It's often helpful to take a look at earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) margins, as well as revenue growth, to get another take on the quality of the company's growth. Martin Marietta Materials shareholders can take confidence from the fact that EBIT margins are up from 18% to 24%, and revenue is growing. Ticking those two boxes is a good sign of growth, in our book."", 'In the chart below, you can see how the company has grown earnings and revenue, over time. For finer detail, click on the image.', ""Fortunately, we've got access to analyst forecasts of Martin Marietta Materials' future profits. You can do your own forecasts without looking, or you can take a peek at what the professionals are predicting."", 'We would not expect to see insiders owning a large percentage of a US$36b company like Martin Marietta Materials. But we are reassured by the fact they have invested in the company. We note that their impressive stake in the company is worth US$264m. While that is a lot of skin in the game, we note this holding only totals to 0.7% of the business, which is a result of the company being so large. So despite their percentage holding being low, company management still have plenty of reasons to deliver the best outcomes for investors.', ""If you believe that share price follows earnings per share you should definitely be delving further into Martin Marietta Materials' strong EPS growth. With EPS growth rates like that, it's hardly surprising to see company higher-ups place confidence in the company through continuing to hold a significant investment. Fast growth and confident insiders should be enough to warrant further research, so it would seem that it's a good stock to follow.

The first notable deployment of the aircraft by the United States was in 1967 with the introduction of the Bell AH-1 Cobra in Vietnam. The single-engine helicopter manufactured by Bell Textron, a subsidiary of Textron Inc. (NYSE:TXT), was rapidly built in response to the needs of the American army during the conflict. More than 1,100 units of the helicopter have been built to-date.', 'Bell Textron is among the major military rotorcraft manufacturers in America’s defense industry. Textron Inc. (NYSE:TXT)’s Bell in 2022 won the US Army’s contract for the Future Long-Range Assault Aircraft programme, which is worth up to $1.3 billion, with plans to replace over 2,000 Black Hawk utility helicopters. This deal with Textron Inc. (NYSE:TXT) is set to be the largest helicopter procurement by the Army in four decades.', 'Another major player in the industry is The Boeing Company (NYSE:BA), which is the maker of the AH-64 Apache turbo-shaft attack helicopter used by the US Army. Defense analysts consider it to be the best helicopter in service currently and expect it to remain in operation till at least 2048. The helicopter has been seen in almost every American and NATO operation since it was launched in 1986.', 'AH-64 Apache can be equipped with cannon, rockets, air-to-air missiles, as well as an advanced precision kill weapon system, which allows it to engage rival helicopters and unmanned aerial vehicles in the airspace, and also take out ground targets including main battle tanks.', 'More than 2,400 units of the attack helicopter have been manufactured by The Boeing Company (NYSE:BA) so far for the US and at least 17 other allies. Poland is set to be the latest country to acquire the AH-64 Apache, after the US in August last year approved a sale worth $12 billion for 96 of these attack helicopters along with other related equipment made by The Boeing Company (NYSE:BA).', 'Apache’s performance can further be bolstered by using Lockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE:LMT)’s Apache Fire Control products which, through their radar and sensor technologies, enhance situational awareness of these helicopters and improve survivability. Several countries have been making use of the company’s offerings. In January 2022, Lockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE:LMT) received a $102 million contract to upgrade Egypt’s 25 AH-64D Apache helicopters. Late last year, Longbow LLC – the joint venture between Lockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE:LMT) and Northrop Grumman Corporation (NYSE:NOC) – got awarded a $10.45 million deal to refurbish the Target Acquisition Designation Sight/Pilot Night Vision Sensor (TADS/PNVS) equipment in the US’ Apache fleet.', 'Pixabay/Public Domain', 'Countries with the most attack helicopters in the world are ranked in ascending order of their fleet size.

The country currently operates 91 attack helicopters, which include 62 AH-1W Super Cobra and 29 AH-64E Apache. Taipei’s decision to paint its AH-64E Apache helicopters with tiger shark-inspired paint schemes have made these deadly choppers look even more sinister.', 'Attack Helicopters: 100', 'Egypt is the most powerful military in Africa, and is equipped with large fleets of modern sophisticated equipment, ranging from battle tanks to fighter jets and attack helicopters. It recently became the first country to use the Russian KA-52 attack helicopters outside of Russia. These choppers comprise nearly half (46) of all its anti-aircraft helicopters. The African country also possesses dozens of Apache helicopters which it has procured from the United States.\xa0', 'Attack Helicopters: 111', 'Turkiye finds itself among countries with the most attack helicopters in the world, with a fleet size of 111, which is a mixture of American Cobra attack helicopters’ AH-1P/S and AH-1W models, as well as the homegrown T129s. The country has a rapidly developing defense sector at home, and last year’s launch of Turkiye’s locally-made T929 attack helicopter was testament to that.

To skip our detailed analysis of the real estate sector, you can go directly to see the 5 Best Real Estate and Realty Stocks To Buy According to Analysts.', 'The real estate sector has been battling with elevated mortgage rates this year, resulting in the US housing market suffering from a lack of demand among the population. However, some may expect the struggles of the real estate sector to abate as the year progresses, especially as many financial professionals begin to analyze the state of US real estate markets. Several spaces within the real estate sector are under-invested in, leaving the arena free and open for investors looking to make a real estate play.', 'On February 29, Carly Trip, the Head of Investments at Nuveen Real Estate, joined CNBC\'s ""Closing Bell Overtime"" to discuss the state of the US real estate markets. Here\'s what she had to say:', '""On the residential market, it\'s kind of like no new news, however what\'s interesting is that the consumer is really starting to explain their tolerance for mortgage rates. In December we saw really strong numbers, mortgage rates had come in about 50 basis points, bouncing around six and a half. As they have suddenly come up since then and hover above 7%, consumers do not like that. And so we\'re seeing the results of that in pending home sales. So we expect that that is not gonna improve, inventory will remain low until rates come around 6%, in which case your cost to own versus cost to rent margin really starts to shrink.""', ""Despite the above observations, Tripp noted that other areas in the real estate markets are doing better. Here's what she said:"", '""Retail\'s doing amazingly well. So retail has been the underdog of the last decade. And what we\'re seeing in our centres is increased activity, a lot of demand, increased sales. The consumer is obviously very resilient and strong. That is accomodating to retail spending, 80% of retail sales do involve a physical store which is a positive for our centres. And not only that, there\'s no new supply added to retail. Over the last five years, about a 130 million square feet of retail has been converted to other uses, so it\'s really been under-invested in. So the outlook for retail is very, very strong.""', 'Similarly, for the industrial real estate side, Tripp had positive insights to share. Here are some of the comments she made:', '""Industrial\'s been incredible. It has performed exactly as real estate should perform. Income has outpaced inflation, right, real estate is expected to be an inflation hedge, that\'s why it\'s such a great diversifier to a portfolio. And so we continue to see incredibly strong demand for industrial. Supply has slowed, that was the concern pre-pandemic. However, due to lack of construction spending, lack of financing just generally speaking, bottlenecks in the construction system, we expect that demand is just gonna continue to flow. E-commerce spending is not going anywhere.', 'Considering these highlights, while the residential side of real estate seems to be still struggling in 2024, that does not mean all real estate should be avoided this year. Several other areas within the sector remain ripe for investment. As such, we have compiled a list of some of the best real estate stocks to invest in, including names such as KE Holdings Inc (NYSE:BEKE), Crown Castle International Corp.

SMCI and Deckers Outdoor Corporation DECK will join the S&P 500 Index, replacing ZION and Whirlpool Corporation WHR, effective Mar 18.ZION and WHR will be joining the S&P Midcap 400 Index.Super Micro is a maker of high-end servers that are used in artificial intelligence applications, whereas Deckers is a footwear manufacturer.After an almost 240% rally in 2023, shares of SMCI have gained more than 200% so far this year as the ecstasy for disruptive technologies has fueled the demand for its servers. Also, the Deckers Outdoor stock has rallied more than 35% this year.With the inclusion of SMCI and DECK in the S&P 500 Index, more importance will be given to the technology and consumer discretionary sectors, with less weight given to the industrial and financial sectors.Notably, the S&P 500 Index is a market-cap-weighted index, which means that with bigger market capitalization, a company will have more influence on the index.In this case, Super Micro’s market cap is approximately $51 billion, which is much above the combined market caps of Whirlpool and ZION.The S&P Dow Jones Indices stated, “The changes ensure each index is more representative of its market capitalization range. All companies being added to the S&P 500 are more representative of the large-cap market space, while all companies being added to the S&P MidCap 400 are more representative of the mid-cap market space.”Looking at ZION, the company, like most of its regional banking peers, has been suffering because of its sizeable exposure to commercial real estate (CRE) loans. As of Dec 31, 2023, ZION’s exposure to commercial loans was 76.1%.And, since the demand for such loans is gradually waning amid a challenging operating backdrop, the asset quality of these loan categories will likely deteriorate in case of an economic slowdown. This is expected to hurt ZION’s profitability.In 2023, shares of ZION lost 10.8%. The stock has declined 11.6% so far in 2024.Amid the rapidly increasing interest rate environment, defaults on CRE loans climbed to 14-year highs last year. Weakness in the CRE lending industry has added to the woes of regional banks like ZION (as these have relatively more exposure to bad loans than their bigger rivals), which have already been struggling with unrealized losses.It is also worth noting that following the regional bank failures, Zions’ long-term issuer rating has been lowered to Baa2 from Baa1 by Moody’s as high level of unrealized losses in available-for-sale and held-to-maturity securities portfolios, and a relatively low level of capitalization pose major headwinds.Over the past six months, ZION shares have gained 7.3% compared with the industry’s 9.7% growth.', 'Image Source: Zacks Investment Research', 'Currently, ZION carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

Firstly, we'd want to identify a growing return on capital employed (ROCE) and then alongside that, an ever-increasing base of capital employed. Put simply, these types of businesses are compounding machines, meaning they are continually reinvesting their earnings at ever-higher rates of return. However, after briefly looking over the numbers, we don't think LyondellBasell Industries (NYSE:LYB) has the makings of a multi-bagger going forward, but let's have a look at why that may be."", ""For those that aren't sure what ROCE is, it measures the amount of pre-tax profits a company can generate from the capital employed in its business. The formula for this calculation on LyondellBasell Industries is:"", 'Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)', '0.12 = US$3.5b ÷ (US$37b - US$7.2b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to December 2023).', ""Therefore, LyondellBasell Industries has an ROCE of 12%.

To be more specific, ROCE has fallen from 23% over the last five years. Given the business is employing more capital while revenue has slipped, this is a bit concerning. This could mean that the business is losing its competitive advantage or market share, because while more money is being put into ventures, it\'s actually producing a lower return - ""less bang for their buck"" per se.', ""From the above analysis, we find it rather worrisome that returns on capital and sales for LyondellBasell Industries have fallen, meanwhile the business is employing more capital than it was five years ago. Yet despite these concerning fundamentals, the stock has performed strongly with a 51% return over the last five years, so investors appear very optimistic. Regardless, we don't feel too comfortable with the fundamentals so we'd be steering clear of this stock for now."", ""On a final note, we've found   3 warning signs for LyondellBasell Industries  that we think you should be aware of."", 'For those who like to invest in solid companies, check out this free list of companies with solid balance sheets and high returns on equity.', 'Have feedback on this article?

I’m not sure how long this discount will last. When looking at the high-side analyst estimate, Kroger may deliver earnings per share of $4.60 in the current year and $4.72 in 2025. I believe the more optimistic range is accurate simply because of economic realities.', 'Yes, circumstances appear to be steamrolling ahead thanks to a robust GDP print and recent jobs performances.

In other words, look for consumers to trade down from expensive coffeeshop visits to buying Coca-Cola caffeinated products.', 'Analysts see good things ahead for KO stock.

Yes, there are other social media platforms. None have the footprint and influence and demographic diversity (as in age group) of Meta’s Facebook. In addition, the company is expanding into many other relevant tech subsectors. Personally, I’m unsure about this whole metaverse deal.

From the business expenses themselves to steep regulatory pressures, it’s difficult to move into the space.', 'Cynically, that makes companies like Exelon entrenched. I don’t know what to say – it is what it is. When you’re looking for stalwart stocks for possible market headwinds, going the cynical route can be effective. Now, to be fair, EXC hasn’t had a great time in the market. One look at its 52-week chart tells you what you need to know.', 'If that wasn’t painful enough, analysts on average see revenue declines in 2024 and 2025. However, the high-side estimate calls for modest growth and that appears to be more accurate. Either way, the strength of Exelon lies in its consistent profitability.

Generative AI protocols are so error prone that they’re effectively useless. There is simply no way that AI can take over people’s jobs unless these jobs are constrained into specific, predictable functions. If you have a dynamic occupation, forget about it.', 'Having said that, investors and enterprises will continue pouring resources into AI. Combined with Microsoft’s dominance in business software and PC operating systems, analysts on average are looking for the company to ring up sales of $244.26 billion in 2024 and $279.24 billion in 2025.', 'That’s a big leap from the company’s fiscal 2023 sales performance of $211.92 billion.

But one look at the stranded EV drivers in some of the coldest areas in the nation might have you rethinking this concept.', 'I’m not saying that electric vehicles are a scam or anything like that. However, I think it would be rash to label big oil as an obsolete sector. Given the tremendous energy density found in fossil fuels, it’s way too early to write off names like ConocoPhillips. Not only that, analysts see no reason to abandon a viable ship.', 'Last year, the company posted revenue of $56.14 billion. Wall Street experts believe that at the end of 2024, ConocoPhillips will ring up $58.96 billion in revenue.

It also invested $550 million in Celsius' convertible preferred stock, further strengthening the bond between the two companies. I consider the agreement with PepsiCo as a game changer. As PepsiCo is the globally recognized brand with world-wide distribution channels, the deal with PepsiCo opens the door for Celsius to unlimited growth opportunities in both U.S. and international markets."", 'Celsius has managed to grow its revenue every single year for the past 10 years. Remarkably, its revenue soared 85-fold, climbing from $7.68 million in 2012 to $653.60 million in 2022. This growth translates to an impressive annual compounded growth rate of 56%. Despite this substantial revenue growth, the company recorded operating losses in nine out of the last 10 years. The only profitable year was 2020, where it posted operating profits of $7.83 million. In 2022, its operating income plummeted to a loss of nearly $158 million.', 'The significant operating losses in 2022 can be attributed to a substantial rise in selling and marketing expenses.

Using a 10% discount rate, the estimated value of Celsius stands at $47 billion. Assuming the company issues 50% more shares over the next five years to fund for its business expansion and acquisitions, the total diluted share count is expected to reach 340 million. Thus, Celsius should be worth $138 per share, 114% higher than its current share price."", ""Celsius Holdings showcases phenomenal business growth, evidenced by its substantial revenue growth and a strong, debt-free balance sheet, emphasizing its financial health.

Quote', ""Despite efforts to stimulate demand, Big Lots may have struggled to overcome broader economic factors affecting consumer spending habits, leading to a continued revenue downturn. This decline may be rooted in consumer reluctance toward high-ticket purchases, particularly in categories like furniture. Intense competition in key segments like food and consumables may have further hurt revenues. However, a 53rd week is expected to contribute approximately 400 basis points to sales.On its last earnings call, management guided fourth-quarter comps to decline in the high-single-digit range. We expect a comps decline of 9.2% for the fourth quarter.Although the company opened new stores, the net decrease in the store count had an unfavorable impact on sales. With store closures concentrated in the fourth quarter, this could have further contributed to a decline in revenues. We anticipate Big Lots to close 39 stores in the final quarter of fiscal 2023.Despite the aforementioned headwinds, cost reduction initiatives and productivity efforts implemented by Big Lots could have positively impacted the bottom line. The company's focus on lowering structural SG&A expenses, optimizing inventory levels and streamlining operations through Project Springboard may have resulted in significant cost savings.The gross margin rate for the fourth quarter might have improved, driven by reduced markdown activity, lower freight costs, and ongoing cost reduction and productivity initiatives. Our estimate for the gross margin is pegged at 38% for the quarter, implying a year-over-year improvement of 170 basis points.
