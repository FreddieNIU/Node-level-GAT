(NASDAQ:VRSK) insiders sold a substantial stake in the company which may have sparked shareholders' attention. When analyzing insider transactions, it is usually more valuable to know whether insiders are buying versus knowing if they are selling, as the latter sends an ambiguous message. However, shareholders should take a deeper look if several insiders are selling stock over a specific time period.While insider transactions are not the most important thing when it comes to long-term investing, logic dictates you should pay some attention to whether insiders are buying or selling shares. Check out our latest analysis for Verisk Analytics Verisk Analytics Insider Transactions Over The Last YearIn the last twelve months, the biggest single sale by an insider was when the insider, Christopher Foskett, sold US$1.2m worth of shares at a price of US$180 per share. That means that an insider was selling shares at slightly below the current price (US$219). We generally consider it a negative if insiders have been selling, especially if they did so below the current price, because it implies that they considered a lower price to be reasonable. While insider selling is not a positive sign, we can't be sure if it does mean insiders think the shares are fully valued, so it's only a weak sign. It is worth noting that this sale was only 25% of Christopher Foskett's holding.In total, Verisk Analytics insiders sold more than they bought over the last year. You can see a visual depiction of insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last 12 months, below. By clicking on the graph below, you can see the precise details of each insider transaction!insider-trading-volumeIf you are like me, then you will not want to miss this free list of growing companies that insiders are buying.Insiders At Verisk Analytics Have Sold Stock RecentlyThere was substantially more insider selling, than buying, of Verisk Analytics shares over the last three months. In total, insiders sold US$1.5m worth of shares in that time. Meanwhile Independent Director Wendy Lane bought US$218k worth , as we said above . Since the selling really does outweigh the buying, we'd say that these transactions may suggest that some insiders feel the shares are not cheap.Story continuesDoes Verisk Analytics Boast High Insider Ownership?Another way to test the alignment between the leaders of a company and other shareholders is to look at how many shares they own. We usually like to see fairly high levels of insider ownership. Verisk Analytics insiders own about US$209m worth of shares (which is 0.7% of the company). I like to see this level of insider ownership, because it increases the chances that management are thinking about the best interests of shareholders.So What Does This Data Suggest About Verisk Analytics Insiders?Unfortunately, there has been more insider selling of Verisk Analytics stock, than buying, in the last three months. Despite some insider buying, the longer term picture doesn't make us feel much more positive. The company boasts high insider ownership, but we're a little hesitant, given the history of share sales. In addition to knowing about insider transactions going on, it's beneficial to identify the risks facing Verisk Analytics. While conducting our analysis, we found that Verisk Analytics has 2 warning signs and it would be unwise to ignore them.If you would prefer to check out another company -- one with potentially superior financials -- then do not miss this free list of interesting companies, that have HIGH return on equity and low debt.For the purposes of this article, insiders are those individuals who report their transactions to the relevant regulatory body.

The ex-dividend date is usually set to be one business day before the record date which is the cut-off date on which you must be present on the company's books as a shareholder in order to receive the dividend. The ex-dividend date is of consequence because whenever a stock is bought or sold, the trade takes at least two business day to settle. Therefore, if you purchase Range Resources' shares on or after the 15th of June, you won't be eligible to receive the dividend, when it is paid on the 30th of June.The company's next dividend payment will be US$0.08 per share, on the back of last year when the company paid a total of US$0.32 to shareholders. Looking at the last 12 months of distributions, Range Resources has a trailing yield of approximately 1.1% on its current stock price of $28.48. If you buy this business for its dividend, you should have an idea of whether Range Resources's dividend is reliable and sustainable. So we need to check whether the dividend payments are covered, and if earnings are growing. View our latest analysis for Range Resources Dividends are typically paid out of company income, so if a company pays out more than it earned, its dividend is usually at a higher risk of being cut. Range Resources paid out just 2.8% of its profit last year, which we think is conservatively low and leaves plenty of margin for unexpected circumstances. That said, even highly profitable companies sometimes might not generate enough cash to pay the dividend, which is why we should always check if the dividend is covered by cash flow. The good news is it paid out just 4.1% of its free cash flow in the last year.It's encouraging to see that the dividend is covered by both profit and cash flow. This generally suggests the dividend is sustainable, as long as earnings don't drop precipitously.Click here to see the company's payout ratio, plus analyst estimates of its future dividends.Story continueshistoric-dividendHave Earnings And Dividends Been Growing?Companies with consistently growing earnings per share generally make the best dividend stocks, as they usually find it easier to grow dividends per share. Investors love dividends, so if earnings fall and the dividend is reduced, expect a stock to be sold off heavily at the same time. It's encouraging to see Range Resources has grown its earnings rapidly, up 46% a year for the past five years. Range Resources looks like a real growth company, with earnings per share growing at a cracking pace and the company reinvesting most of its profits in the business.The main way most investors will assess a company's dividend prospects is by checking the historical rate of dividend growth. Since the start of our data, 10 years ago, Range Resources has lifted its dividend by approximately 7.2% a year on average. We're glad to see dividends rising alongside earnings over a number of years, which may be a sign the company intends to share the growth with shareholders.To Sum It UpHas Range Resources got what it takes to maintain its dividend payments? Range Resources has grown its earnings per share while simultaneously reinvesting in the business. Unfortunately it's cut the dividend at least once in the past 10 years, but the conservative payout ratio makes the current dividend look sustainable. There's a lot to like about Range Resources, and we would prioritise taking a closer look at it.With that in mind, a critical part of thorough stock research is being aware of any risks that stock currently faces. Be aware that Range Resources is showing 3 warning signs in our investment analysis, and 1 of those is concerning...Generally, we wouldn't recommend just buying the first dividend stock you see.

4,450c5f06-26bb-3a98-8ef9-2aa00edad9d0,NUE,2023-06-11,15 Largest Aluminum Producing Countries In The World,Insider Monkey,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/15-largest-aluminum-producing-countries-085042002.html,1686473442,STORY,"['AA', 'RIO', 'NUE']","[In this detailed article, we'll research where aluminum is found in the world and find the largest aluminum producing countries. If you want brief knowledge on which nations are driving the international market of this widely-used and mined metal, read 5 Largest Aluminum Producing Countries In The World. Aluminum is the third most abundant element in the Earth's crust, comprising approximately 8% by weight. However, aluminum rarely exists in its pure form and is typically found in bauxite ore. Bauxite deposits are in a wide belt around the equator, with the largest bauxite reserves in Guinea, Australia, Vietnam, and Brazil. Furthermore, the commercial extraction of aluminum also happens in China, which amounts to 58% aluminum smelter production. China asserted its dominance as the largest producer of aluminum in the world in 2022, owing to its extensive year-end mining capacity. Since China also has the largest aluminum reserves in the world and immense smelting capacity, its assertion as the leading producer is undisputed. However, environmental concerns and resource-intensive aluminum smelting are obstacles to the country's aluminum industry.Other leading countries in aluminum production are Russia and India, which, despite having smaller bauxite reserves, produce a significant percentage of aluminum because of huge domestic demand and integrated production systems. Notably, Russia's aluminum industry, driven by Rusal, has flourished despite geopolitical pressures and economic sanctions. Since aluminum production depends on a country's bauxite mining, we recommend reading Top 20 Largest Producers of Bauxite In The World.Global Aluminum MarketGlobal aluminum market was $179.32 billion in 2022 and is projected to reach $277.5 billion by 2031 by the end of this decade. This market will grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 5.61% from 2022 to 2031 and further contribute to the GDP of the largest aluminum producing countries in the world.Story continuesDeveloping sectors like automotive, construction, and packaging industries require aluminum to meet their production. Therefore, the global aluminum consumption in 2022 was recorded to be 65.87 million metric tons. This figure is projected to reach 78.4 million metric tons by 2029, owing to the expansion in major industries worldwide. Since aluminum is lightweight, durable, and corrosion-resistant, it has been increasingly adopted as a preferred manufacturing material. While this increase is a positive sign for the major aluminum producing countries in the world, the depletion of its reserves is concerning. Hence, countries are implementing more diverse aluminum recycling efforts to reduce the load of smelters. In the automotive and building sectors, aluminum recycling reaches up to 90%. As a result, 75% of aluminum ever produced is still in use today, indicative of this industry's long-term stability. If you want to know which metal stocks you should load up on, take a look at 11 Best Metal Stocks To Buy Now and grow your financial footprint. Main Alumining Mining Companies Alcoa Corporation (NYSE:AA) is the largest American aluminum company that holds a prominent position in aluminum mining. Alcoa Corporation (NYSE:AA) has headquarters in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, and spearheads the industry through its expansive bauxite mining to the manufacturing of aluminum products. Alcoa Corporation (NYSE:AA) focuses on sustainable mining so the raw sources for aluminum don't get unfairly exploited. Another prominent name in the aluminum industry is the Rio Tinto Group (NYSE:RIO). In 2022, Rio Tinto Group (NYSE:RIO) produced a substantial 521,100 metric tons out of a total of 3 million metric tons of aluminum. Rio Tinto Group (NYSE:RIO) is also the world largest aluminum-producer company, with a market capitalization of $116 billion. It has well-planned mining strategies that don't exhaust aluminum resources from the Top 10 largest aluminum producing countries in the world. Another company doing well in aluminum mining is Nucor Corporation (NYSE:NUE), based in Charlotte, North Carolina. Nucor Corporation (NYSE:NUE) aims to improve the quality of its aluminum products, increase yield, and minimize environmental impact. Notably, Nucor Corporation (NYSE:NUE) emphasizes recycling efforts that underscore its commitment to sustainable mineral exploitation. 15 Largest Aluminum Producing Countries In The WorldPhoto by Shane Cottle on UnsplashOur Methodology We relied on the USGS Mineral Commodity Summaries of 2023 and 2018 as our primary data sources to rank the 15 largest aluminum producing countries. Owing to its diverse data sources, USGS provides extensive and annually updated databases on all minerals to showcase which country produces maximum aluminum in the world.The annual USGS reports offer well-documented information that covers multiple aspects related to minerals, i.e., production, consumption, and trade. As we analyzed the summaries, we studied the sections focusing on aluminum to understand the aluminum production statistics of all major countries. Moreover, since the 2023 summary focused on the 11 largest aluminum producers, we dug deep into the SUSG summaries from 2018, 2019, and 2020. Eventually, we were able to rank based on solid aluminum production statistics for a clear perspective on this global market.Based on our understanding of where aluminum is found in the world, here are this metal's largest producers:  15. Brazil Aluminum Smelter Production in 2018: 0.66 million metric tons Brazil hit 0.66 million metric tons of aluminum in 2018, and impacted the global market of this key industrial metal. The largest alumina mine in Brazil is the MRN mine, owned by Vale S.A. (NYSE:VALE), which extracted 10.46 million metric tons of bauxite in 2022, a major portion of which went to aluminum production. 14. Qatar Aluminum Smelter Production in 2019: 0.697 million metric tons Data reveals that Qatar's aluminum smelter output reached 0.697 million metric tons in 2019. This industry-specific statistic hints at the Gulf nation's significant role in the global aluminum sector. The most notable aluminum smelter in Qatar is Qatalum, located in the Mesaieed Industrial Area as a joint venture between QatarEnergy and Norsk Hydro. 13. South AfricaAluminum Smelter Production in 2019: 0.699 million metric tons South Africa's aluminum sector achieved a noteworthy output of 0.699 million metric tons from its smelters in 2019. This data indicates the significance of aluminum production to South Africa's economy and advancements in its smelting operations. The largest aluminum smelter in the Northern Hemisphere, named Hillside Aluminium, is also located in Richards Bay, South Africa.12. Iceland Aluminum Smelter Production in 2022: 0.75 million metric tons Iceland's aluminum production capacity experienced noteworthy utilization of 0.75 million metric tons in 2022. This achievement owes to the country's renewable geothermal and hydroelectric energy sources to fuel the energy-intensive smelting process. The Grundartangi smelter in Iceland alone has a production capacity of approximately 317,000 metric tonnes of aluminum with its low-cost operations. 11. Malaysia Aluminum Smelter Production in 2017: 0.76 million metric tons Malaysia, owing to its 110 million metric tons of bauxite reserves, demonstrated significant industrial productivity in the non-ferrous metals sector. The country's output amounted to 0.76 million metric tons of smelted aluminum in 2017. 10. Saudi Arabia Aluminum Smelter Production in 2019: 0.85 million metric tonsThe major alumina refinery in KSA is Ma'aden Bauxite and Alumina Company (MBAC), with a mining capacity of 1.8 million metric tons of alumina. Reports indicate Saudi Arabia yielded 0.85 million metric tons of aluminum in 2019. This smelter, paired with the country's capacity, makes it a top player in the global aluminum market.  9. United StatesAluminum Smelter Production in 2022: 0.86 million metric tonsAs per the USGS summary, the United States had an aluminum smelter production of 0.86 million metric tons in 2022. Although not exceptional, this yield is a result of the major US aluminum smelters operating at their full capacity. Some smelters also worked at reduced capacity because of increased mining costs and energy shortages but impacted industry demands in the automotive, packaging, and construction sectors. 8. Norway Aluminum Smelter Production in 2022: 1.4 millionData reveals that Norway mined 1.4 million metric tons of aluminum in 2022. The biggest aluminum refinery in Norway is Norsk Hydro, which operates many aluminum plants in Sunndal, Årdal, and Husnes. It's also Europe's third-largest aluminum maker that impacts this non-ferrous metal industry, and helps Norway's resource management strategies.7. Australia Aluminum Smelter Production in 2022: 1.5 million metric tonsAustralia generated 1.4 million metric tons of aluminum in 2022 via its vast smelters and refineries. Its largest aluminum smelter is Tomago Aluminum, which has been functional since 1983 and contributes $2.2 billion annually to the country's economy. Tomago's robust infrastructure and innovative processing techniques continually support Australia's steady climb in global aluminum production rankings.6. Bahrain Aluminum Smelter Production in 2022: 1.6 million metric tons The Kingdom of Bahrain has been influencing this metal's market over the years. In 2022, Bahrain's smelter production was 1.6 million metric tons of aluminum. Aluminium Bahrain (Alba) is the world's 2nd largest and Bahrain's largest aluminum smelter, with a production capacity of 1.548 million metric tons. This smelter has also fostered stable growth in Bahrain's non-oil sector, owing to its diverse refining infrastructure. Click to continue reading 5 Largest Aluminum Producing Countries In The World.Suggested Articles:15 Biggest Aluminum Companies in the WorldTop 20 Largest Cobalt Producing CountriesTop 20 Largest Producers Of Bauxite In The WorldDisclosure: None. 15 Largest Aluminum Producing Countries In The World is originally published on Insider Monkey. ]"

(NYSE:AYI) shareholders, since the share price has fallen 16% in that time. But that doesn't change the fact that the returns over the last three years have been pleasing. To wit, the share price did better than an index fund, climbing 64% during that period.Now it's worth having a look at the company's fundamentals too, because that will help us determine if the long term shareholder return has matched the performance of the underlying business. Check out our latest analysis for Acuity Brands While the efficient markets hypothesis continues to be taught by some, it has been proven that markets are over-reactive dynamic systems, and investors are not always rational. One way to examine how market sentiment has changed over time is to look at the interaction between a company's share price and its earnings per share (EPS).During three years of share price growth, Acuity Brands achieved compound earnings per share growth of 17% per year. We note that the 18% yearly (average) share price gain isn't too far from the EPS growth rate. Coincidence? Probably not. That suggests that the market sentiment around the company hasn't changed much over that time. Quite to the contrary, the share price has arguably reflected the EPS growth.The graphic below depicts how EPS has changed over time (unveil the exact values by clicking on the image).earnings-per-share-growthWe like that insiders have been buying shares in the last twelve months. Having said that, most people consider earnings and revenue growth trends to be a more meaningful guide to the business. It might be well worthwhile taking a look at our free report on Acuity Brands' earnings, revenue and cash flow.A Different PerspectiveAcuity Brands shareholders are down 7.3% for the year (even including dividends), but the market itself is up 10%. Even the share prices of good stocks drop sometimes, but we want to see improvements in the fundamental metrics of a business, before getting too interested. On the bright side, long term shareholders have made money, with a gain of 6% per year over half a decade.

That’s because Yardeni, unlike many other analysts,  doesn’t rely on long-held, yet unproven beliefs like “Interest rates are rising, so stocks will fall” to make his predictions. Instead, he provides an in-depth analysis of the forces affecting the economy and the stock market.  As a result, with Yardeni now sounding very bullish on the U.S. economy and stocks, I’m convinced that investors should look for the best stocks to buy on a dip.Refuting bears’ arguments about the narrowness of the stock market’s current rally, Yardeni recently noted that many stocks have reached all-time records in the last several weeks. He added that the earnings estimates for a multitude of firms have been revised higher, and he believes that artificial intelligence could cause a “Productivity boom,” leading to a “Roaring 2020’s boom.”So with the economy and stocks potentially poised to surge, here are seven of the best stocks to buy on a dip.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsBest Stocks to Buy on a Dip: MGM (MGM)hands at desk near laptop computer, with one hand holding a pile of hundred dollar bills. Bank stocksSource: shutterstock.com/CC7Despite the continued boom in Las Vegas, MGM (NYSE:MGM) stock sank 9.3% in the last month. I believe that the shares have tumbled because recent data has suggested that the Chinese economy is weakening, potentially boding poorly for the two casinos that MGM owns in the Asian country. But in the first quarter, MGM obtained only $618 million of revenue from China out of its total top line of $3.9 billion.Moreover, in May, gross gaming revenue in China reached “a post-pandemic high,” and yoga apparel maker Lululemon (NASDAQ:LULU) reported that its revenue from “greater China” had surged 79% year-over-year in Q1. Given all of these points, I believe that MGM is one of the best stocks to buy on a dip.Story continuesAmerican Superconductor (AMSC)A person draws a stock chart on a chalkboard.Source: Zurijeta / Shutterstock.com American Superconductor (NASDAQ:AMSC) has rallied recently, but it’s still down 19% from its Feb. high of $6.57.On May 31, the company announced it had “agreed to deliver nearly $20 million” of its wind turbine electrical control systems to India’s Inox Wind. The news indicates that AMSC’s long-dormant partnership with Inox is finally reaccelerating, boding very well for AMSC’s long-term outlook. And in two other very positive signs, the company on May 9 noted that it had obtained $30 million of orders for its “new energy power systems orders,” while it disclosed on April 25 that it had agreed to provide a new, “pre-production” anti-mine system for the U.S. Navy.Last quarter, the company’s top line jumped over 10% year-over-year to a “recent record,” and CEO Daniel McGahn stated that it had reached a positive turning point. Further,  the CEO expects its gross margin to climb going forward and noted that the company’s 12-month backlog had exceeded $125 million, as the orders for its new energy power systems had surged over 75% during its fiscal 2022.Maxeon (MAXN)tree growing on coin of stacking with green bokeh background; growth stocksSource: Freedom365day / Shutterstock.comMaxeon (NASDAQ:MAXN), a China-based solar module producer, closed at $29.03 on June 1, well below its mid-May high of nearly $38. I believe that the shares have declined primarily due to worries about the Chinese economy and fears about the outlook of residential solar in the U.S. amid California’s reduced payments for electricity produced by rooftop solar systems. And the company’s offering of 7.5 million shares earlier this month also pushed down its share price.But, as I noted in the section on MGM, China’s gross gaming revenue reached a post-lockdown record last month, while Lululemon reported that its revenue from “greater China” had surged 79% year-over-year in Q1. Given these points, I think it’s clear that concerns about the Chinese economy are overdone.Meanwhile, consulting firm Wood McKenzie estimated that U.S. solar installations would jump 41% this year. And despite the negative development in California, the overall U.S. residential solar installations are expected to increase this year.Finally, last quarter, Maxeon’s top line surged 43% year-over-year, and U.S. investors seem more upbeat about the stock than other China-based solar names.  Perhaps that’s because French energy giant TotalEnergies (NYSE:TTE) has a 36.4% stake in the company.EVgo (EVGO)Stocks to buy: smartphone with the words ""buy"" and ""sell"" displayed on the screen. The user's finger is about to press buy. Stock charts are in the background of the image.Source: Chompoo Suriyo / Shutterstock.comThe shares of EV charger operator EVgo (NASDAQ:EVGO) tumbled 35% in the month that ended on June 1.The sharp downturn appears to have been sparked by the company’s decision, announced on May 17, to offer $125 million of new shares of its stock.However, investment bank Stifel on May 17, shortly before the stock offering,  initiated coverage of the shares with a “buy” rating. The bank believes that EVgo has a “strong market position” in the fast charging space and a “solid track record” of choosing highly profitable locations for its chargers.Also noteworthy is that, on April 4, the company announced that it would receive $6.6 million in subsidies from California. EVgo will use the funds to deploy chargers in the eastern and central portions of the state. Finally, EVgo should benefit a great deal from much larger federal subsidies for the deployment of EV chargers. These funds are expected to finally be disbursed next year.Best Buy (BBY)a green button on a keyboard has an arrow pointing upward with the word ""Buy"". representing safe stocks to buySource: AdityaB. Photography/ShutterStock.comBest Buy (NYSE:BBY) is down about 20% from its Feb. high of $91.42. But I believe that guidance issued by PC maker Dell (NYSE:DELL) on June 1 bodes very well for BBY stock. Specifically, Dell expects its Q2 revenue to be “between down 3% and up 1%” versus Q1. Moreover, that includes a negative impact of two percentage points from currency fluctuations. The outlook indicates that the PC market is starting to recover, suggesting that other electronics markets could also be rebounding.And the company expects its sales to climb in the second half of the year versus the first half. Given Dell’s outlook, I believe that Best Buy’s guidance for a comparable sales decline of 3%-6% this year is probably conservative. The shares have a very low forward price-earnings ratio of just 12 and a trailing price-sales ratio of only 0.37.Roku (ROKU)A businessman ripping his shirt off to reveal an upward green arrow with the word buy on it underneathSource: ImageFlow/Shutterstock.comRoku (NASDAQ:ROKU) stock is down 20% from its Feb. high of around $71. But in a good sign for the shares, the spending on ads for connected TV is expected to climb over 14% this year. Moreover, the company on April 26 reported encouraging first-quarter results as its top line increased 1% year-over-year and it added a net total of 1.6 million active accounts versus the same period a year earlier. Further, Roku reported that it had a 43% share of smart TV sales in the U.S. last quarter.Also encouraging is that the company expects its top line to climb to about $770 million this quarter, up from $741 million in Q1. Further, the company is targeting positive EBITDA, excluding certain items, next year. As recessionary fears dissipate in the second half of the year and in 2024, I expect the TV ad market to rebound meaningfully. Additionally, Roku’s strong account growth and high market share should enable it to significantly increase its ad revenue over the longer term.El Pollo Loco (LOCO)image of businessperson and bar graph with dollar signs to represent undervalued stocksSource: Wright Studio/Shutterstock.comEl Pollo Loco (NASDAQ:LOCO) reported good first-quarter results on May 4, as its top line climbed 4% versus the same period a year earlier and its income from operations more than doubled to $7.8 million. However, the shares are 28% below their February high of around $12.80. Additionally, LOCO stock has a low forward price-earnings ratio of 11.6 and a tiny trailing price-sales ratio of 0.7.Also noteworthy is that Loco is aggressively looking to expand to new parts of the U.S. in the coming years. The expansion should meaningfully boost the company’s top and bottom lines. Finally, LOCO is launching a new ad strategy that could help it meaningfully increase its brand awareness going forward.Given these points, LOCO is one of the best value stocks to buy on a dip at this point.As of the date of publication, Larry Ramer owned shares of  MGM, AMSC, MAXN, and EVGO.

More hawkish members are convinced rates aren’t yet restrictive enough, and the Fed shouldn’t risk falling behind the curve. We see a ‘hawkish skip’ as a way to maintain unanimity on the committee.”The U.S. Consumer Price Index hit 40-year highs in June 2022, expanding at an annual rate of 9.1%. Since then, it has slowed, growing at just 4.9% per annum in April, for its slowest expansion since October 2021. The Fed’s favorite price indicator, the Personal Consumption Expenditures, or PCE, Index, meanwhile, grew by 4.4% in April. Both the CPI and PCE are, however, still expanding at more than twice the Fed’s 2% per annum target for inflation.Traders now have their eyes on the May CPI reading due Tuesday, a day before the Fed decision.On the OPEC+front, crude prices finished Friday’s trading even lower than before last weekend’s meeting of the world’s top oil producers, where Saudi Arabia tried to “surprise” the market with another production cut.Story continuesThat surprise is in inverted commas because many market watchers had already appeared to know that Minister Abdulaziz bin Salman and his Saud contingent would announce a unilateral output cut if there was no willingness by the rest to put up one.The million-barrel cut that Abdulaziz tried to cutely label as a “Saudi lollipop” couldn’t sustain its sweetness beyond a couple of days.After a fleeting pop of nearly 3% on Sunday and another 1% rebound on Wednesday, crude prices had fallen most this week.The downside was distorted partly by a false report from a Middle East news portal on Thursday about a U.S.-Iran nuclear deal that could legitimately channel some sanctioned oil from Tehran to the market.“It’s been a volatile week for oil prices, starting with the spike on the back of Saudi Arabia’s one million barrel production cut and ending with the US and Iran denying a temporary nuclear deal that saw prices plunge on Thursday,” said Craig Erlam, analyst at online trading platform OANDA. “These are very jittery markets against the backdrop of a deteriorating economic outlook.”Erlam also noted that the Saudi production cut had little impact on the eventual price of oil.With its latest maneuver on output, Saudi Arabia is effectively pledging to remove some 2.5M barrels per day from its production since October, versus a normal run of 11.5M barrels. The Saudi move came after its 12 partners in OPEC, or the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, and 10 other allies, including Russia, in the OPEC+ alliance decided to stay pat on production.Reuters reported on Friday that the Saudis appeared to have caught those in OPEC+ unawares with their move. But almost all traders contacted by Investing.com seemed to have guessed the move, more because of Abdulaziz’s rabid obsession in trying to triumph against short-sellers in the market with his so-called production surprises that were losing their impact with each attempt of his.“He’s fast becoming the court jester of OPEC with his dares against speculators,” said John Kilduff, partner at New York energy hedge fund Again Capital. “Instead of behaving in a dignified way appropriate for the head of OPEC+, he’s acting like a street brawler. These production cuts would have so much more impact if done sparingly, or even quietly. Let the data speak for itself. You always have your ‘gotcha’ moment with the market then.”Erlam of OANDA agreed. ”The Saudis are clearly not on the same page as their allies and are seemingly far more price obsessed,” the analyst said. “They won some concessions from (price projections for) 2024 but that’s a long time away and much can and probably will change in that time.”The Saudi obsession with getting the market its way was reinforced by a Washington Post report on Friday that suggested that Crown Prince and king-in-waiting Mohammed bin Salman planned to hurt America in a big way if the Biden administration had retaliated against the kingdom’s deep oil production cuts that began eight months ago. The Post’s story was based on information embedded in dozens of highly-classified documents leaked online under a dossier called the ‘Discord Leaks’.In what might give oil bulls a frisson of hope, the U.S. Department of Energy, or DoE, announced on Friday it has committed to buy approximately 6 million barrels of crude oil thus far to replenish the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, or SPR, which has seen draws of about 200 million barrels over the past year and a half.A DoE statement said it was undertaking the “purchase of 3 million barrels and new solicitation for purchase of 3 million additional barrels [that] advances efforts to replenish the reserve at a good deal for American taxpayers, maintain the SPR’s operational readiness, and protect the nation’s energy security.”Ten companies submitted 30 proposals in all to supply the first tranche of 3 million barrels, and five were successful, the DoE said.“This purchase has been fully subscribed, and the contracts were awarded to five companies,” the statement said. “These 3 million barrels are being purchased for an average price of about $73 per barrel, lower than the average of about $95 per barrel that SPR crude was sold for in 2022, securing a good deal for taxpayers.”The first tranche of oil, when ready for shipment, will be delivered to the Big Hill SPR storage site between August 1-31.Despite the seemingly bullish element of the announcement, Anas Alhajji, a widely-followed energy market commentator on Twitter, said: “Oil bulls must realize that, if all stars line up for the Biden administration to refill the SPR with 180 million barrels, it needs about a year and half. If you do not know this, time to wake up!”Oil: Market Settlements and Activity New York-traded West Texas Intermediate, or WTI, crude ended Friday’s session at $70.35 - down $0.94, or 1.32%, on the day. It plunged to as low as $69.09 earlier, breaking the key $70 support.London-traded Brent crude settled Friday’s session at $75.04 - down 92 cents, or 1.2%, on the day. Brent’s session low was $73.61, breaking its $75 support.Oil: WTI Technical OutlookThe U.S. crude benchmark is expected to bounce around in the $75 to $67 region in the coming week, said Sunil Kumar Dixit, chief technical strategist at SKCharting.com.“We expect sideways moves within the broader range of the Weekly Middle Bollinger Band of $74.90 as the resistance zone and the 200-week SMA, or Simple Moving Average of $67.25, as the horizontal support zone,” said Dixit.He added that the Weekly Stochastics reading at 32/39 indicated a lack of bullish momentum.Gold: Market Settlements and Activity Gold was headed for a second straight weekly gain on Friday, posting its third rise in four days, amid bets the Federal Reserve will pause its rate hike cycle for the first time in 18 months.The front-month gold contract on New York’s Comex settled at $1975.90 an ounce, down $2.70, or 0.14%, on the day. For the week, it was up 0.4%, about the same as the previous week.The spot price of gold, which reflects physical trades in bullion and is more closely followed than futures by some traders, settled at $1,960.97, down $4.65, or 0.2% on the day. For the week, spot gold was up 0.7%, adding to the previous week’s near-flat close.Bets for a Fed rate pause grew on Friday despite higher weekly unemployment claims among Americans.According to Investing.com's Fed Rate Monitor Tool, there is a 70.1% chance that the central bank will stand down from a rate hike when its policy-makers sit on June 14.Ed Moya, analyst at online trading platform OANDA, said gold’s choppiness in recent weeks was due to a lack of conviction over the economy that hadn’t helped tip the market’s balance either way.Tuesday’s CPI reading for May could “ultimately determine whether gold breaks higher once more with potential record high ambitions or continues to correct lower”, Moya added.Gold: Spot Price Outlook Thus far, gold has been showing a rebound from the horizontal support base formed between $1,932 and $1,942, said SKCharting’s Dixit.“A rebound towards $1,973 remains within the boundaries of previous week's high of $1,983,” Dixit said.Clearing through the $1,975-$1,978 initial resistance zone will set stage for a retest of the swing high of $1,983, and on strong acceptance above this zone, resumption of an uptrend targeting $2,006 can be followed by the next Fibonacci level $2,015.”On the flip side, a sustained break below 100-Day SMA of $1,937 will eventually extend the drop to $1,913-$1,910, Dixit said.“Gold bears may be preparing for repositioning their shorts from the higher zone of $2,006-$2,015 for a better risk-vs-reward ratio eyeing for $1,910.”Natural gas: Market Settlements and Activity Natural gas futures limped in with a daily gain and a small weekly loss as market participants look beyond the first injection of above 100 billion cubic feet, or bcf, in the current storage season for the fuel in anticipation of near-term demand.The front-month gas contract on the New York Mercantile Exchange’s Henry Hub registered a final post-settlement trade of $2.262 per mmBtu, or million metric British thermal units, after officially settling Friday’s session at $2.25, down 9.8 cents, or 4.2% on the day. For the week, the contract finished up 9 cents, or 4%, after the 15.6% plunge in the prior week.“The second half of June into early July suggests that consistent heat isn’t too far off into the future and once that heat materializes demand will rebound,” analysts at Houston-based energy markets advisory Gelber &amp; Associates said in a note.The market appears to be starting to price this in and further bullish support may materialize, the Gelber note said.The weekly rebound came after the Energy Information Administration, or EIA, reported a build of 104 billion cubic feet, or bcf, for gas inventories after the previous week’s 110 bcf.With the latest stockpile increase, the EIA reported that total gas in underground caverns in the United States stood at 2.55 trillion cubic feet, or tcf - up 28.3 % from the year-ago level of 1.988 tcf and 16.1% higher than the five-year average of 2.197 tcf.Just two weeks ago, Henry Hub’s benchmark gas contract hovered at 11-week highs of around $2.70, breaking out from the tight confines of mid-$2 pricing on the notion that the market may finally be turning the corner on fundamentals despite its oversupplied state.But in recent days, it fell back to under $2.50, which has proven again to be a formidable barrier for gas bulls.Natural gas: Price OutlookNatural gas has to hold above $2.03 to avoid another plunge to sub-$2 levels, Dixit of SKCharting said.“Gas bulls don’t appear ready yet to mark a bullish rebound, with the week-long price action lacking any significant moves, except for a pause in decline,” Dixit added.“Sustainability below $2.27 indicates chances of a further consolidation towards the $2.13 support. Any sustained break below that risks a drop to $2.03, followed by a reach for the $1.944 horizontal support zone.”He said the 100-Day SMA of $2.40 held the key for upward mobility towards the resistance zone set by the 5-month EMA, or Exponential Moving Average, of $2.67, which is closely followed by a swing high of $2.685.Disclaimer: Barani Krishnan does not hold positions in the commodities and securities he writes about.Related ArticlesHedge Funds Pile Into Bullish Oil Wagers Amid Saudiâs Surprise Oil CutOil posts second weekly decline as demand concerns overshadow Saudi cut]"

(AP) — A Native American tribe in North Dakota bought an idle pipeline from the energy company Enbridge to help deliver oil from wells on its reservation to the broader market.The Mandan, Hidatsa and Arikara Nation announced the deal Friday but didn't disclose how much it paid. The tribe said it expects the pipeline, which will connect its oil facilities on its Fort Berthold Reservation to Enbridge's large pipeline network, will be up and running within a year.“This is a major step in enhancing our ability to get our trust assets of oil and gas out to market,” tribal chair Mark Fox said to the Bismarck Tribune.There are more than 2,600 active oil and gas wells on the reservation that produced an average of 144,190 barrels of oil per day in February, according to the most recent figures from the state Department of Mineral Resources. Regulators estimate there is potential for 3,911 additional oil and gas wells on the reservation.The 31-mile pipeline is the closest one to the tribe's Thunder Butte Petroleum subsidiary's transloading and oil storage facility. It can transport 15,000 barrels a day.Mike Koby, vice president of U.S. liquids pipelines operations for Calgary, Alberta-based Enbridge, said the MHA Nation will be the first tribal shipper on an Enbridge pipeline.

When we think about how risky a company is, we always like to look at its use of debt, since debt overload can lead to ruin. We can see that Salesforce, Inc. (NYSE:CRM) does use debt in its business. But should shareholders be worried about its use of debt?When Is Debt Dangerous?Debt is a tool to help businesses grow, but if a business is incapable of paying off its lenders, then it exists at their mercy. Part and parcel of capitalism is the process of 'creative destruction' where failed businesses are mercilessly liquidated by their bankers. However, a more frequent (but still costly) occurrence is where a company must issue shares at bargain-basement prices, permanently diluting shareholders, just to shore up its balance sheet. Having said that, the most common situation is where a company manages its debt reasonably well - and to its own advantage. When we examine debt levels, we first consider both cash and debt levels, together. See our latest analysis for Salesforce What Is Salesforce's Debt?As you can see below, Salesforce had US$9.60b of debt at April 2023, down from US$10.6b a year prior. However, its balance sheet shows it holds US$14.0b in cash, so it actually has US$4.38b net cash.debt-equity-history-analysisA Look At Salesforce's LiabilitiesWe can see from the most recent balance sheet that Salesforce had liabilities of US$21.6b falling due within a year, and liabilities of US$14.5b due beyond that. On the other hand, it had cash of US$14.0b and US$4.63b worth of receivables due within a year. So it has liabilities totalling US$17.5b more than its cash and near-term receivables, combined.Since publicly traded Salesforce shares are worth a very impressive total of US$209.7b, it seems unlikely that this level of liabilities would be a major threat. Having said that, it's clear that we should continue to monitor its balance sheet, lest it change for the worse. Despite its noteworthy liabilities, Salesforce boasts net cash, so it's fair to say it does not have a heavy debt load!Story continuesEven more impressive was the fact that Salesforce grew its EBIT by 1,005% over twelve months. That boost will make it even easier to pay down debt going forward. When analysing debt levels, the balance sheet is the obvious place to start. But ultimately the future profitability of the business will decide if Salesforce can strengthen its balance sheet over time. So if you want to see what the professionals think, you might find this free report on analyst profit forecasts to be interesting.Finally, a company can only pay off debt with cold hard cash, not accounting profits. While Salesforce has net cash on its balance sheet, it's still worth taking a look at its ability to convert earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) to free cash flow, to help us understand how quickly it is building (or eroding) that cash balance. Over the last three years, Salesforce actually produced more free cash flow than EBIT. There's nothing better than incoming cash when it comes to staying in your lenders' good graces.Summing UpWe could understand if investors are concerned about Salesforce's liabilities, but we can be reassured by the fact it has has net cash of US$4.38b. And it impressed us with free cash flow of US$7.1b, being 440% of its EBIT. So we don't think Salesforce's use of debt is risky. When analysing debt levels, the balance sheet is the obvious place to start. But ultimately, every company can contain risks that exist outside of the balance sheet. For instance, we've identified   2 warning signs for Salesforce  that you should be aware of.If, after all that, you're more interested in a fast growing company with a rock-solid balance sheet, then check out our list of net cash growth stocks without delay.Have feedback on this article?

You can skip our detailed analysis of the corporate litigation dynamics in the US and go directly to the 5 Most Litigious Companies in America.Legal battles have become an expensive and often unavoidable part of the business world, where companies find themselves caught up in disagreements. This results in significant financial losses, disruptions to operations, and continuous legal activity that can harm the company's reputation and how people perceive its brand.A new study by Acritas, now part of Thomson Reuters, reveals that US companies, on average, spend approximately 0.4% of their revenue on legal services, which is a staggering 166% higher than their global counterparts. Lisa Hart Shepherd, chief executive officer of Acritas said this: “Generally, the US is a much more litigious country” The enormous financial burden cripples companies, particularly smaller ones with limited resources, potentially diverting funds that could otherwise be allocated to innovation, expansion, or employee development. In 2012, technology giant Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) found itself embroiled in a high-stakes patent infringement lawsuit against Samsung Electronics. After a protracted legal battle, a jury awarded Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) over $1 billion in damages, a significant blow to Samsung.Amidst this landscape, certain courts have gained prominence for their expertise and reputation in resolving complex corporate cases. One such court is the Delaware Chancery Court. Known for its specialized knowledge and experience in corporate law, the Delaware Chancery Court attracts a wide range of litigants, including both large multinational companies and smaller entities. The court's reputation stems from its ability to handle high-stakes disputes efficiently and impartially.A notable case that highlights the significance of the Delaware Chancery Court is the Twitter acquisition lawsuit. Twitter took legal action against Elon Musk when he backed out of the $44 billion deal to buy the social media company. However, Musk closed the deal and acquired Twitter based on the original agreement before the court's decision. Story continuesWithin the litigation industry, trends in trademark, copyright, and patent infringement cases have emerged, influencing law firms and legal advisors. The 2019 Litigation Trends Annual Survey reveals a notable increase in demand for legal advisors, as indicated by a 17% growth in the size of in-house legal teams. This positive trend is accompanied by a minimal 2% decrease in team sizes. Additionally, the quantity of patent litigation cases is often influenced by economic factors, such as the general level of business activity and investment.These industry trends provide valuable insights into the evolving landscape of litigation and the strategies adopted by companies to navigate legal challenges. As litigation continues to shape the business environment, companies must carefully consider their legal approaches and seek experienced counsel to safeguard their interests.How Big is the Legal Industry in the US?The market share of the legal industry in the US is approximately $373 billion.

For more stocks, head on over to 5 Momentum Stocks Billionaires Are Loading Up On. Just as there are countless different sectors of stocks for every flavor of economic sentiment, there are a variety of different approaches to investment as well. Broadly speaking, investing can be bifurcated into two categories. These are playing the fundamentals and playing the technicals. And while the latter is often dependent on the former, it is possible to isolate them and focus only on one strategy.Investing with the fundamentals involves an understanding of a firm's balance sheet and its market performance. Companies with stable cash flows, significant share price ratios to their earnings, large growing markets, and countless other metrics are often preferred depending on the investing strategy. Investing with technicals is a graph-based game that looks at share price trends, market sentiment measured through the volume of shares traded, and a handful of other metrics.These days, the macroeconomic environment is one of the most watched indicators. Specifically, investors are wondering if there will be a recession in America and how effective the Federal Reserve's fight against inflation has been. For the latter, June has proven to be an interesting month. Economy watchers were left confused when the May jobs report from the Labor Department revealed that while the number of jobs grew, the unemployment rate also ticked up. However, as the second week of June kicked in, the market was dealt a pleasant surprise.The Labor Department came out with some good news (at least for investors) in its unemployment insurance claims report. Its data showed that the initial claims for the week ending on June 3rd were 261,000 marking a 28,000 jump from the prior week. According to the department, the only time in recent history the number of claims was higher was during the coronavirus pandemic when the claims at the end of October 2021 stood at 264,000. State wise, California accounted for half of the weekly jump, reporting 5,173 additional non seasonally adjusted claims.Story continuesThe market, safe to say, was ecstatic. Economists polled by Reuters had expected the claims figure to come in at 235,000 so the data beat expectations by quite a margin. However, before you get too enthusiastic, keep in mind that economists are also urging caution, as the numbers are quite volatile on a weekly basis and since the data is dominated by a handful of states instead of being a broader occurrence. Some also believe that the data might also be influenced by automakers' seasonal shutdown of plants to retool their machines.Turning to the markets, the NASDAQ jumped by 89 basis points while the NASDAQ 100 rose by a little over one percent. This is because the technology sector is one of the most sensitive ones to high interest rates and the latest release hints that perhaps the Federal Reserve might exercise more restraint. The S&amp;P500 marked a smaller, 49 basis point increase while the NYSE Composite was up by 12 basis points. However, the Russell 2000 index was down by 49 basis points, since the latest data also points to an economic slowdown which often negatively affects small-cap companies.So how to play these recent market trends? Well, on the technical side of investing, one popular strategy is momentum investing. Simply put, momentum investing involves taking a look at recent price trends to determine if there are a sufficient number of buyers and sellers of stock and if their interest can create a self sustained period of price movements that can be leveraged for profit. The seminal work on momentum investing, and one that laid the ground work for today's strategy, was a research paper from Narasimhan Jegadeesh and Sheridan Titman published in The Journal of Finance March 1993 edition. This paper examined NYSE and AMSE stocks between 1965 and 1989 and the results of sixteen trading strategies that picked stocks on the basis of historical stock returns ranging from one to four quarters. All the strategies that the researchers studied yielded positive results, leading them to conclude:Trading strategies that buy past winners and sell past losers realize significant abnormal returns over the 1965 to 1989 period. For example, the strategy we examine in most detail, which selects stocks based on their past 6-month returns and holds them for 6 months, realizes a compounded excess return of 12.01% per year on average. Additional evidence indicates that the profitability of the relative strength strategies are not due to their systematic risk. The results of our tests also indicate that the relative strength profits cannot be attributed to lead-lag effects that result from delayed stock price reactions to common factors. The evidence is, however, consistent with de- layed price reactions to firm-specific information.So, it appears that there are indeed quite a lot of benefits when taking a momentum based approach to investing. Naturally, this led us to take a look at some momentum stocks that billionaires are buying and some top picks are Campbell Soup Company (NYSE:CPB), AutoZone, Inc. (NYSE:AZO), and Mettler-Toledo International Inc. (NYSE:MTD).Momentum Stocks Billionaires Are Loading Up OnOur Methodology To make our list of the momentum stocks being bought by billionaires, we used three indicators - the relative strength index (RSI), the average volume, and the 50-day simple moving average. The RSI measures how fast a stock's price is rising or falling, the average volume analyzes whether the shares traded are above typical levels, and the 50-day simple moving average smooths out price fluctuations. Through these, we first narrowed down to an initial list of stocks based on criteria that looks whether the stock's 50-day moving average was above the 200-day moving average, whether the RSI indicated an oversold stock, and if its relative volume was twice the normal levels. Finally, to ensure that only quality stocks were included, stocks with only recommended Hold or better ratings were picked. This presented us with an initial list of 20 momentum stocks with the best analyst ratings. We then used Insider Monkey's database of billionaire-owned stocks and choose 10 out of these 20 stocks with the highest number of billionaire investors as of the first quarter of 2023.Momentum Stocks Billionaires Are Loading Up On10.

And thanks to all of you for joining us today. Before getting into our prepared remarks, I want to thank our Signet team. Our company continues to be recognized as a great place to work because of the outstanding people we work alongside. In a pressured quarter, we delivered on our commitments, thanks to their agility and excellent customer service. I'm proud to lead this team. There are three key messages, I'd like to reinforce in my remarks today. First, we achieved our revenue and bottom line commitments in Q1, despite macroeconomic headwinds that worsened late in the quarter.Story continuesAdditionally, as we predicted, there were fewer engagements in the quarter resulting from COVID's disruption of [dating three] [ph] years ago. Given softening trends in late April, we've leveraged high margin innovation in services and fashion, as well as strategic promotions to quickly respond to competitive pressures. These results reflect the agility we built in our team and our flexible operating model. Second, we are adjusting our guidance for the year reflecting current market conditions, lowering revenue expectations based on increasing macro pressure on consumer spending. On the bottom line, our operating model continues to deliver at a double-digit annual rate. However, we are intentionally choosing to invest in the capabilities that we believe are creating sustainable competitive advantages and driving market share growth to expand the moat around our business.We have the advantage of having built a fortress balance sheet that fuels our ability to invest in a period of disruption, which we believe gives us significant competitive advantage. Third, we remain confident in our mid-term goals that we outlined at our April Investor Day. In fact, our proprietary consumer insights give us increased confidence that engagements will begin to recover at the end of [fiscal 2024] [ph], and we're positioning ourselves to accelerate market share growth. Turning to the quarter, we delivered nearly $1.7 billion in sales and more than $106 million in non-GAAP operating income, both at the high-end of our guidance. We achieved this despite 50% of our business being in bridal, which we expected to decline and in an environment that deteriorated late in the quarter, which we've seen continue in the second quarter.The swing factors in recent consumer confidence, lower tax refunds, economic concerns triggered by regional bank failures, and continued inflation led to a weakening trend in spending across the jewelry industry of an additional 10 points that we estimate based on external reports. Bridal and macroeconomic conditions were two important drivers in the quarter, so I'll comment on both of them. We expected the low double-digit decline in engagements that we saw this quarter. Similar to the fourth quarter, we expected to see units decline, but we also expected growth in average transaction value, which did not materialize. This reflects the accelerated macro pressures on spending, as well as a heightened promotional environment. Those factors that we expect to continue.We believe we are growing market share and bridal in this environment. In fashion, we continue to see pressure at lower price points as has been the case for the past year. However, later in the quarter, we began to see degradation at higher price points between $1,000 and $5,000 in fashion. Price points remain strong at $5,000 and above. This price erosion continued into the second quarter. Nonetheless, our intentional focus on building out our fashion category over the last three years, which has grown to 36% in that time to become a bigger portion of our mix has positioned us to gain market share and is having the positive impact we've designed for in this current environment. I'll talk more about our guidance update shortly, but I want to first look at the value of the investments we've made to differentiate Signet from competitors and position us to gain market share.In particular, our banner portfolio, our services business, and our digital and data capabilities, all of which were important strengths in Q1. Our broad portfolio of banners is working as it is designed to do. As we've repositioned it, Jared is a good example. Jared now represents an important mezzanine between fine jewelry and luxury jewelry. In each of the last nine quarters, Jared has increased average transaction value versus previous year by providing the higher quality metal, elegant cuts, and exclusive brands that Jared customers want. And we're piloting a preferred assortment in select stores that has driven a 600 basis point improvement in sales versus the balance of the fleet and a 1,500 basis point improvement to average ticket sales.We expect to roll it out more broadly in the months ahead. The value and potential of our services business continues to be evident. Services grew more than 5%, compared to this time last year, reflecting the notable progress across our services offerings, a key driver with our extended service agreements or ESAs. The attachment rate for ESAs increased more than 2 points exiting the quarter with higher velocity. This is a particularly impressive result since our highest attachment is typically in bridal. Custom is another good example. We expect a custom to decline in the quarter at a similar rate to merchandise sales. Yet this growing service bucked the trends, increasing penetration, and contributing to core margin expansion. We've been building our services offerings based on deep consumer research and it's working.The improvements we've made in custom and repair drove a service margin increase of 340 basis points, compared to the prior year. Our loyalty program is demonstrating meaningful growth as well. We recently introduced the option to enroll in our loyalty program when first creating an account on one of our banner sites, creating a frictionless point of entry for our customers. This enhancement has enabled a more than 50% increase in members in the quarter. This matters because our loyalty numbers are more frequent purchasers and have a 20% higher spend than non-loyalty members. These examples represent continued progress toward our midterm goal of $1.2 billion in service business revenue, as well as an important step change in the way services performed as a category.Historically, services revenue has trended alongside merchandise, often impacted by the same drivers. This quarter, services is a standout category, and a clear reflection of our investments. We've changed the trajectory of this part of our business through ESA product differentiation, increased digital access and visibility, and increased training. The final strength I'd like to highlight is the value our digital and data analytics capabilities. Our investments in digital continue to be a differentiator and a bright spot for us in the current environment, increasing penetration in the quarter. We believe that's both an indication of the macro environment where consumers are browsing and researching more before they buy and also the investments we've made to create a great customer experience.Our digital net promoter score, or NPS, is now at an all-time high, having grown three points over the last quarter and nine points, compared to this time last year, and 96% of promoters say they will shop with us again. As consumer expectations continue to increase, we are updating our digital experience, meeting customers how and where they want to shop, with us at a scale that's hard to match. We implemented more than a dozen new priority feature launches this quarter and we're on-track for an additional 20 in the second quarter. These features include enhancements to online merchandise presentation, messaging, appointment booking, and services. With these and future improvements to come, we are sharply focused on customer delight and increased conversion.Beyond digital, our proprietary data and ability to mine it for insights is a significant source of competitive advantage. We see its value in Bridal, for example. As we mentioned at our Investor Day, we have identified and tracked a proprietary list of 45 milestones that trace a couple's journey through four major relationship stages, meeting, exclusivity, committed, and engagement. What our data has shown is that once couples experience at least 27 of these milestones, it becomes highly likely that they will move to engagement. For example, couples traveling together is one of the top milestones later in the couple's journey to engagement. We see evidence of this milestone currently across our data sources, including online search activity.accessory, alloy, aquamarine, burs, closeup, collet, craft, craftsman, desktop, diamond, drill, equipment, fitter, gold, goldsmith, graver, handmade, industry, jeweler, jewelers, jewelery, jeweller, jewellery, jewelry, job, loupe, magnifier, manual, manufacturing, metal, mill, piece, preform, profession, professional, ring, silver, still, tool, tools, work, workbench, worker, working, workshopCopyright: NejroN / 123RF Stock Photosearches for couples vacation on TikTok are currently twice what they were in Q4. Google searches for travel or vacation together are up more than 30%. In fact, multiple data sources that we track for other key proprietary indicators are also up significantly. The key point is that we're seeing the engagement milestones occurring as expected, which reinforces our confidence that engagements will begin to recover as we approach the end of the year. We are investing to win as this unfolds. Personalized marketing is another example of our data capabilities. Our marketing efficiency and effectiveness continue to improve as we personalize our approach, including a 9% increase to our return on ad spend in the first quarter with advertising as a percent of sales flat compared to this time last year.Our customer data platform, which enables our personalized journeys, is still relatively new in implementation. That said, we've already built nearly 30 million customer profiles and the platform is configured to activate across channels like email, SMS texting, web, and social. I want to put this into perspective for you. We estimate those 30 million customer profiles represent roughly 40% of U.S. jewelry customers who make a purchase in a given year, and we've been adding over 1 million new profiles every month. The marriage of these two things are proprietary consumer insights and our leading customer data platform is a powerful combination that doesn't exist at our scale anywhere else in the North America jewelry industry. Our unique consumer insights capability enables us to see and understand pre-engagement couples as they make progress through their relationship toward engagement, and our personalization capability enables us to interact with them at important steps, increasing the likelihood that they'll come to us when they're ready to get engaged.This also generates insights into all the milestone moments that come later in their lives and enables us to build life time relationships with them. This integrated approach to our insights and customer data is at the heart of our transformation, and our long-term growth potential. We will continue to invest behind it as we get better and better every year. One final example of how we're leveraging data is the way we're driving out product cost without compromising quality and innovation. A recent example is a sourcing technology that we've activated, which we call the loop. This is a leading sourcing system that allows us to benchmark standardized component costs, establish should cost pricing models, and create transparency and cost negotiations across our network, lowering costs, and matching product demand and supply needs with the right vendors across all our banners.We're early in our implementation, but already in Q1, we estimate that we avoided mid-single-digit cost increases to [loose stones] [ph]. Based on our early success, we are now doubling our expectation of savings from $20 million to $40 million this year and believe we can ultimately save up to $200 million annually over time. This level of cost transparency gives us a clear competitive advantage, particularly with current macro headwinds. The point of these examples is to underscore that the investments we've made and continue to make to strengthen critical capabilities and create competitive advantages are working. Our financial strength allows us to keep investing to widen the mode around our business and position Signet for ongoing market share gains.I'll touch briefly now on our guidance update. As a result of the deteriorating macro environment and impact on consumer spending patterns we saw late in Q1 and throughout May, we are revising guidance to reflect continuation of these trends for the balance of the year. We’ve updated our forecast to account for a lower range of top line outcomes and now expect revenue for the year to be between $7.1 billion to $7.3 billion. Based on sales data in May and June for the industry, we believe this guide positions us to grow market share as current trends are pointing to a larger decline across the industry. As I said earlier, our model provides double-digit operating margins even in a tough macroenvironment. We are maintaining investments this year of nearly $75 million in OpEx to enhance our digital and IT capabilities and up to $200 million in capital, which is a demonstration of our increasing confidence in the recovery of engagements and our ability to achieve our mid-term goals.These investments will pressure margins by approximately 1 point, placing us temporarily below our double-digit target in a range of 8.9% to 9.2%. Importantly, these investments strategically position us to take advantage of the expected recovery in bridal that will begin later this year and capture share when the current macro headwinds received. Our flexible operating model is in place and working, and our fortressed balance sheet gives us this opportunity. We're also taking action in three key areas. We're heightening our focus on innovation at the right price points working to stimulate demand through relevant newness within our assortments, personalized customer journeys, and strategic promotions, all while balancing our inventory position.We believe our lean inventory and [heightens turn] [ph] gives us the opportunity to bring newness to markets faster than our competition, and our scale allows us to create excellent value. Secondly, we are more than doubling our cost savings initiatives from [$100 million] [ph] this year to $225 million to $250 million. And third, we're accelerating our ongoing fleet optimization and plan to close up to 150 stores over the next 12 months that are not meeting our expectations for productivity. Joan will provide more perspective, but I'll close just by coming back to the core messages we're focusing on today. We delivered our revenue and bottom line commitments in Q1 despite significant pressure, reflecting our agility and flexible operating model.We're adjusting our guidance to reflect current macroeconomic conditions, while continuing to invest intentionally and the capabilities that we believe are driving market share growth, and we remain confident in both the recovery of engagements and in our ability to achieve the mid-term goals that we outlined at our April Investor Day. On that note, I'll pass it over to Joan.Joan Hilson: Thanks, Gina, and good morning, everyone. I want to reinforce today's message by focusing on one of the most important factors in our control, our flexible operating model. We are able to proactively respond to the current business environment and continue to strategically invest to drive market share gains precisely because of our model and our strong balance sheet. Turning to the quarter. We delivered nearly $1.7 billion in sales. This represents a sales decline of 9.3% and 13.9% on a same store sales basis. Traffic was down in the quarter in a mid-single-digit range on a relatively flat ATB and lower conversion. We leveraged strategic promotion towards the end of the quarter as we saw trends soften. In addition, we were able to drive growth in services of over 5%, notably outperforming merchandise performance in the quarter.This is a clear competitive advantage for us in the jewelry industry given our scale and skilled network of [Artisan Jewelers] [ph]. Our e-commerce penetration increased 500 basis points to nearly 23%, compared to a year ago, reflecting our strategic investments in digital. Turning now to gross margin, we delivered non-GAAP gross margin of $633 million or 38% of sales, a decline of a 160 basis points, compared to the prior year. Core merchandise margin expanded more than 100 basis points, compared to last year, including the positive contribution of services, discount controls, and strategic sourcing initiatives that generated product cost savings. That benefit was offset by deleveraging of fixed costs such as occupancy on lower sales, as well as the 50 basis point impact relating to product mix of the digital banner.Moving on to SG&amp;A, our non-GAAP spend of $524 million or 31.4% was 240 basis points higher than last year and reflect deleveraging of fixed costs on lower sales and incremental investments and capabilities. And we delivered on our cost savings expectations for the quarter as we continue to identify sourcing opportunities and leverage the flexibility inherent in our labor model. Importantly, in the quarter, our financial services team reached a three-year extension with Bread Financial to further secure stability and the cost of our financial services program. All of this builds to a non-GAAP operating margin of a $106.5 million or 6.4%, which compares to 10.6% in the prior year. The reduction included approximately 200 basis points related to strategic investments and the Blue Nile acquisition for which we expect the margin pressure to abate in the third quarter.The balance of the reduction in rate is related to deleveraging of cost on a mid-teen comp sales decline. Turning to the balance sheet, we ended the quarter with over $650 million of cash and equivalents, down $270 million compared to a year ago. Excluding $200 million in legal settlements paid this quarter, and the nearly $390 million acquisition of Blue Nile in the third quarter of last year, we would have increased our cash by over $300 million. We ended the quarter with just under $2.2 billion in inventory. Our inventory was down $33 million compared to last year. Excluding Blue Nile, our core inventory was down a $128 million or 6% lower, reflecting our use of data analytics to inform working capital management on a store-by-store basis.We've maintained nearly a 1.4x [turn] [ph] with our capital efficiency efforts and our inventory is healthy, paving the way for continued newness in our assortment. We continue to value the strength of our debt position with an adjusted debt-to-EBITDA leverage ratio of 2.1x and 1.7x on a net debt basis, we remain in a healthy position to execute on our capital priorities and well below our target of less than 2.75x. Capital returns to shareholders continues to be a priority for Signet. Year to date, we have repurchased $39 million or 500,000 shares and have $761 million in repurchase authorization remaining. We also announced a quarterly cash dividend on common shares this morning of $0.23 per share for the second quarter, payable August 25th to shareholders of record on July 28th of this year.Consistent with our rigorous cost control, we are proactively flexing our model to respond to trends in our business. As Gina mentioned, we are increasing our cost savings target for the year from $100 million to a range of $225 million to $250 million. We expect to achieve this by maximizing our flexible labor model, which allows for dynamic staffing both in stores and in our customer care centers. Leveraging AI as a growing capability across many business areas to drive cost out of the system, accelerating the benefits of vertical integration, while working with our supply chain to drive cost transparency, driving out administrative costs that do not impact customers. And finally, accelerating the benefits of our investments and capabilities to build competitive advantages.Further, as part of our ongoing evaluation of underperforming stores, we now expect to close, up to 150 stores over the next 12 months, largely at expiration. We take a holistic approach to drive share, market-by-market leveraging our leading consumer insight capabilities at scale. We perform a continuous review of mall, off-mall, and digital channel activity in the given trade area to ensure we are most effectively supporting our connected commerce experience. Most of these closures will likely be in traditional mall locations. Compared to fiscal 2020, off-mall and outlet comparable revenues have outperformed malls by over 800 basis points, and we've seen over 70% growth in comparable e-commerce revenue. Further, compared to fiscal 2020, comp sales of stores in our top 7 markets have outperformed our remaining fleet by more than 500 basis points as we continue our strategy to drive share in top markets.I'll now turn to guidance. As a result of declining trends in late April, and for the second quarter to date, we expect the current softness will continue throughout the year and have updated our guidance to account for a lower range of top line outcome. We believe the current trend reflects the impact of increasing macro pressure on discretionary categories, including the jewelry industry. For example, going into Mother's Day, we expect it to see a $40 million to $50 million shift from Q1 into Q2 as a result of timing. And we did not see this shift materialize. Additionally, we began to see softening at higher price points, which previously had been relatively insulated and lower price points remained under pressure. With this in mind, we expect revenue in the second quarter to be in the range of $1.53 billion to $1.58 billion.We expect non-GAAP operating income in the range of $85 million to a $100 million. This outlook includes a small portion of the cost action we detailed earlier, as well as the continuation of strategic investments and the impact of the Blue Nile acquisition in the quarter. Looking to the full-year, we now expect fiscal 2024 revenue in the range of $7.1 billion to $7.3 billion, with the fourth quarter year-over-year performance expected to be slightly higher than the second and third quarters. In addition to bridal recovery and the 53rd week in fourth quarter of this year, we will be lapping the UK strikes during last year's holiday season. We now expect revenue for the year to decline between 7% to 9% after reducing our full-year revenue expectation by approximately $550 million.We anticipate that we will outperform the industry, despite a higher bridal mix thus driving market share gains. We now expect non-GAAP operating income in the range of $635 million to $675 million, reflecting lower revenue, the additional cost savings impacting both gross margin and SG&amp;A, primarily in the second half of the year, and maintaining strategic investments. This represents a non-GAAP operating margin of approximately 9% or a low double-digit margin, excluding the investments showcasing the true flexibility of our model. This translates to a non-GAAP earnings per diluted share in the range of $9.49 to $10.09, which reflects a reduction of interest expense for the year and share repurchases through today to partially offset reduced expectations in operating income.Before we move on to Q&amp;A, I want to thank our team members who exemplify our culture for their resilience and agility, which consistently drive results and serves our customers. And now, I'd like to open the line for Q&amp;A.See also 25 Best Beaches in California and 10 Best Coal Mining Stocks to Buy.To continue reading the Q&amp;A session, please click here.]"

(NYSE:HCA) is about to go ex-dividend in just four days. Typically, the ex-dividend date is one business day before the record date which is the date on which a company determines the shareholders eligible to receive a dividend. It is important to be aware of the ex-dividend date because any trade on the stock needs to have been settled on or before the record date. Accordingly, HCA Healthcare investors that purchase the stock on or after the 15th of June will not receive the dividend, which will be paid on the 30th of June.The company's next dividend payment will be US$0.60 per share, and in the last 12 months, the company paid a total of US$2.40 per share. Calculating the last year's worth of payments shows that HCA Healthcare has a trailing yield of 0.9% on the current share price of $271.79. Dividends are a major contributor to investment returns for long term holders, but only if the dividend continues to be paid. So we need to investigate whether HCA Healthcare can afford its dividend, and if the dividend could grow. View our latest analysis for HCA Healthcare Dividends are usually paid out of company profits, so if a company pays out more than it earned then its dividend is usually at greater risk of being cut. HCA Healthcare paid out just 11% of its profit last year, which we think is conservatively low and leaves plenty of margin for unexpected circumstances. Yet cash flow is typically more important than profit for assessing dividend sustainability, so we should always check if the company generated enough cash to afford its dividend. What's good is that dividends were well covered by free cash flow, with the company paying out 15% of its cash flow last year.It's positive to see that HCA Healthcare's dividend is covered by both profits and cash flow, since this is generally a sign that the dividend is sustainable, and a lower payout ratio usually suggests a greater margin of safety before the dividend gets cut.Story continuesClick here to see the company's payout ratio, plus analyst estimates of its future dividends.historic-dividendHave Earnings And Dividends Been Growing?Businesses with strong growth prospects usually make the best dividend payers, because it's easier to grow dividends when earnings per share are improving. If earnings decline and the company is forced to cut its dividend, investors could watch the value of their investment go up in smoke. That's why it's comforting to see HCA Healthcare's earnings have been skyrocketing, up 28% per annum for the past five years. With earnings per share growing rapidly and the company sensibly reinvesting almost all of its profits within the business, HCA Healthcare looks like a promising growth company.Another key way to measure a company's dividend prospects is by measuring its historical rate of dividend growth. In the last five years, HCA Healthcare has lifted its dividend by approximately 11% a year on average. It's exciting to see that both earnings and dividends per share have grown rapidly over the past few years.The Bottom LineShould investors buy HCA Healthcare for the upcoming dividend? HCA Healthcare has grown its earnings per share while simultaneously reinvesting in the business. Unfortunately it's cut the dividend at least once in the past five years, but the conservative payout ratio makes the current dividend look sustainable. Overall we think this is an attractive combination and worthy of further research.On that note, you'll want to research what risks HCA Healthcare is facing. In terms of investment risks, we've identified 2 warning signs with HCA Healthcare and understanding them should be part of your investment process.If you're in the market for strong dividend payers, we recommend checking our selection of top dividend stocks.Have feedback on this article?

Based on this payment, the dividend yield on the company's stock will be 3.8%, which is an attractive boost to shareholder returns. See our latest analysis for Packaging Corporation of America Packaging Corporation of America's Earnings Easily Cover The DistributionsWe like to see robust dividend yields, but that doesn't matter if the payment isn't sustainable. Prior to this announcement, Packaging Corporation of America's dividend was comfortably covered by both cash flow and earnings. This means that a large portion of its earnings are being retained to grow the business.Looking forward, earnings per share is forecast to fall by 9.4% over the next year. If the dividend continues along the path it has been on recently, we estimate the payout ratio could be 58%, which is comfortable for the company to continue in the future.historic-dividendPackaging Corporation of America Has A Solid Track RecordEven over a long history of paying dividends, the company's distributions have been remarkably stable. The annual payment during the last 10 years was $1.00 in 2013, and the most recent fiscal year payment was $5.00. This works out to be a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of approximately 17% a year over that time. Rapidly growing dividends for a long time is a very valuable feature for an income stock.Packaging Corporation of America Could Grow Its DividendSome investors will be chomping at the bit to buy some of the company's stock based on its dividend history. Packaging Corporation of America has seen EPS rising for the last five years, at 8.0% per annum. Earnings are on the uptrend, and it is only paying a small portion of those earnings to shareholders.Packaging Corporation of America Looks Like A Great Dividend StockOverall, we like to see the dividend staying consistent, and we think Packaging Corporation of America might even raise payments in the future. The earnings easily cover the company's distributions, and the company is generating plenty of cash. If earnings do fall over the next 12 months, the dividend could be buffeted a little bit, but we don't think it should cause too much of a problem in the long term. All in all, this checks a lot of the boxes we look for when choosing an income stock.Story continuesCompanies possessing a stable dividend policy will likely enjoy greater investor interest than those suffering from a more inconsistent approach. However, there are other things to consider for investors when analysing stock performance.

To skip our detailed analysis, head directly to NATO Military Spending by Country: Top 5 Countries.Global military spending has reached a record high with $2.2 trillion spent on defense expenditure in 2022, with Europe seeing its steepest rise in 30 years amid Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. The three largest military spenders, the United States, China, and Russia, accounted for 56% of the world total. Military spending from NATO members increased by 0.9% from 2021, to a total of $1.2 trillion in 2022. These statistics were published by the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIRPI) in April this year.The surge in spending has created a boom for the armament manufacturing industry. Lockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE:LMT) reported net sales of $66 billion and a net profit of $5.7 billion in 2022. Raytheon Technologies Corporation (NYSE:RTX)’s net earnings for the year ended March 2023 were $14.1 billion – an increase of 8.90% from last year. Northrop Grumman Corporation (NYSE:NOC) also announced that its profits in 2022 had risen by 2.5% compared to 2021. The revenues of General Dynamics Corporation (NYSE:GD) and BAE Systems plc were also significantly higher than in the preceding year.NATO, the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, is an intergovernmental alliance between 31 countries with an integrated military command structure. 29 of its members are European, while two of them are North American. The alliance is sourced through direct and indirect contributions of members. NATO does not have its own armed forces. Members commit troops and equipment on a voluntary basis. There is no obligation for allies to contribute, unless Article 5 of the treaty is invoked, which calls for collective defense.NATO’s 2% Defense Expenditure GoalDefense Ministers of NATO countries in 2006 agreed for their countries to commit at least 2% of their GDP on defense expenditure. This decision was made to ensure NATO’s military readiness. By 2014, only three allies were meeting this goal. That number is now up to seven. The change has been driven by calls from the United States urging allies to increase defense spending by country to meet NATO’s target.Story continuesThe United States is the biggest military spender in the world. According to a report released by NATO this year, the U.S. is estimated to have spent more than $821 billion on defense expenditure in 2022 – the highest amount in the world, which is close to 40% of all global spending on defense in that year, and nearly three times higher than the amount spent by China, the world’s second biggest military spender.Another significant factor behind more NATO members increasing military spending is that European governments are actively taking measures to strengthen their defense following Russia’s annexation of Crimea in 2014, and the invasion of Ukraine in 2022. This is discussed in detail in our article, 20 Strongest Militaries in Europe. Germany, for instance, has announced to commit $112 billion to a special fund to bolster its armed forces and meet NATO’s spending target of 2% over the next few years. German lawmakers approved an order for 35 F-35A fifth-generation fighter jets from Lockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE:LMT), with the first set of planes set to arrive in 2027. This is one of the series of contracts, worth $13.8 billion, that were approved by the parliament last year.While governments that are part of NATO are taking steps to increase their military spending as share of GDP, only seven countries are meeting the target of 2%, and a vast majority are falling well below the goal. Luxembourg (0.62%), Spain (1.09%), Belgium (1.18%), Slovenia (1.26%), and Canada (1.29%) make the bottom of our list of military spending by country for NATO members. These are the NATO countries that spend the least share of their GDP on defense, considering that Iceland does not have a military and therefore, its spending is negligible. Türkiye, which has the second largest standing army in NATO, also spends a mere 1.37% of its GDP on defense and does not make the top 20 list.NATO’s Military Spending in UkraineMembers of NATO have been aggressively arming Kyiv to resist Russian advances. The United States is the largest NATO contributor to Ukraine, having spent $46.6 billion as of February 2023 in military assistance, according to data shared by the Council on Foreign Relations. By December 2022, Lockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE:LMT) had missile orders worth $950 million from Pentagon to refill stockpiles in Ukraine.Much of this amount was dedicated to the production of HIMARS and GMLRS. Earlier in the same year, Raytheon Technologies Corporation (NYSE:RTX) had been awarded a $624 million contract to build 1,300 stinger missiles for Ukraine. In January 2023, the U.S. announced to send 31 M1 Abrams tanks built by General Dynamics Corporation (NYSE:GD) in fresh military assistance to Ukraine.The United Kingdom is the second largest NATO contributor to Ukraine with over $7.5 billion pledged in military funding, followed by Germany at third. The UK announced to send 14 of its Challenger 2 tanks, while Germany said it would send 88 Leopard tanks to aid Ukraine’s fight against Russia.NATO’s 2023 military budget is $2.1 billion dollars. The United States, United Kingdom, and Germany have pledged to contribute nearly half of it – 43.9% to be precise. NATO’s chief has urged member nations to increase their share of military spending to at least 2% of the GDP.MethodologyWe have ranked the top 20 list of military spending by country for NATO members by sorting them based on countries’ defense spending as percentage of GDP. This metric is directly aligned with NATO’s requirement of countries having to spend at least 2% of their GDP on defense. The list has been prepared using data released by NATO this year on the estimated defense expenditures incurred by its members in 2022. Countries that had the same percentage of defense spending as share of GDP in 2022 were sorted based on their spending shares in the previous year. A country whose share had increased this year relative to last year outranked the country whose share of spending had decreased this year compared to last year.NATO Military Spending by Country: Top 20 CountriesPhoto by Kevin Schmid on UnsplashLet’s look at the top 20 NATO countries with the highest military spending as a percentage of their GDP.20. DenmarkMilitary spending as share of GDP: 1.38%Denmark is a Scandinavian country which only spends 1.38% of its GDP on defense expenditure. The government has announced to spend about 21 billion euros in the next ten years to meet NATO’s military spending by country target of 2%. Denmark is home to Terma Group, a company that produces defense systems such as command and control, radars, space technology, and aircraft self-protection systems. In 2022, it went into a contract with Northrop Grumman Corporation (NYSE:NOC) to cooperate on electronic warfare training opportunities in Northern Europe.19. HungaryMilitary spending as share of GDP: 1.44%The Hungarian government announced in June 2022 to raise its defense spending from $3 billion per year to $4.5 billion for 2023. Hungary has been taking active measures since 2019 to increase its military spending as percentage of GDP, which currently stands at a paltry 1.44%. In 2022, Hungary signed a deal with Raytheon Technologies Corporation (NYSE:RTX) to purchase air defense missiles worth $1 billion – which was Budapest’s largest defense procurement ever from the United States.18. GermanyMilitary spending as share of GDP: 1.49%According to NATO statistics, Germany is estimated to have spent only 1.49% of its GDP on defense in 2022. However, the government in Berlin is considering a written pledge to NATO for increasing its defense spending to at least 2% of the GDP. Germany has also committed itself to contributing 319 million euros to NATO’s 2023 military budget. Germany and United States, together, will be making up over 30% of the total budgetary amount of 1.96 billion euros.17. ItalyMilitary spending as share of GDP: 1.51%Italy is the 11th largest spender on military in the world in terms of monetary value, with a defense expenditure of $32 billion in 2022. However, this is only 1.51% of its GDP, which is over $2 trillion. Italy is fourth on the list of the 20 Strongest Militaries in Europe. Its air force has a fleet of 14 F-35 fifth-generation fighter jets and has placed an order with Lockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE:LMT) worth $524 million in 2022 for another 18 of these jets. On the naval side, it boasts 2 aircraft carrier warships – the Giuseppe Garibaldi and Cavour.16. BulgariaMilitary spending as share of GDP: 1.54%Bulgaria is estimated to have spent 1.54% of its GDP in 2022 on defense expenditure. According to a survey held by NATO this year, 83% of Bulgarians are in favor of their country increasing its military spending. The country is a key ally of the United States, which has spent over $238 million in military assistance to Bulgaria over the last five years. Eastern Europe’s first command and control center was built in Sofia, Bulgaria in 2004 by Northrop Grumman Corporation (NYSE:NOC).15. NorwayMilitary spending as share of GDP: 1.57%Norway’s military spending as percentage of GDP touched NATO’s 2% target in 2020 but has plummeted down to 1.57% in 2022 – the lowest since 2015. Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has, however, forced a rethink, with the country’s prime minister announcing to raise defense spending to 2% of the GDP by 2026. In November last year, the Norwegian government entered a contract with Lockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE:LMT) for its TPY-4 radars to boost its national defense.14. AlbaniaMilitary spending as share of GDP: 1.57%Albania had the same defense spending as share of GDP as Norway did in 2022 but outranked the latter due to its consistent growth in defense spending over the last few years. Barring a fraction of a dip in 2021, Albania’s spending has grown from 1.10% of the GDP in 2016 to 1.57% of the GDP in 2022. The country’s defense minister in May 2022 announced that his country had bought anti-tank javelin missiles from Lockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE:LMT) to strengthen the army. The cost and quantity were not disclosed.13. North MacedoniaMilitary spending as share of GDP: 1.61%North Macedonia is another country that is on upward trajectory as far as meeting NATO’s military spending by country target of 2% is concerned. Its military spending as share of GDP has consistently grown from 0.89% in 2017 to an estimated 1.61% in 2022. According to a report in Janes, the government in Skopje has approved a budget of $292 million for defense in 2023, with the aim of modernizing the armed forces.12. NetherlandsMilitary spending as share of GDP: 1.64%The Dutch government announced in late 2022 that it would be spending nearly $3.5 billion in military procurement in wake of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. This will not only help the Netherlands strengthen its defense, but is also expected to take its military spending share as percentage of GDP to above 2% by 2024.11. RomaniaMilitary spending as share of GDP: 1.75%Romania spent over 2% of its GDP on defense in 2020. That share is estimated to have dropped in 2022. However, the government is determined to increase military spending amid the ongoing Russia-Ukraine war. A senior official announced in March this year that Romania plans on submitting a request to the United States in 2024 for procurement of Lockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE:LMT)’s F-35 fighter jets. The parliament has also approved the purchase of 54 used M1A2 Abrams tanks, manufactured by General Dynamics Corporation (NYSE:GD), from the United States.10. Slovak RepublicMilitary spending as share of GDP: 1.76%Slovak Republic, also known as Slovakia, is the tenth biggest spender on military in terms of share of GDP. It is estimated by NATO to have spent 1.76% of its GDP on defense spending in 2022. This includes a $1.37 billion deal for the delivery of 152 infantry fighting vehicles from BAE Systems plc. The Slovakian government aims to achieve NATO’s 2% defense spending target in 2024.9. FranceMilitary spending as share of GDP: 1.89%France is one of the strongest militaries in the world, and Europe’s largest in terms of manpower. You can read more on it in our list of the most powerful militaries in the world in 2023. In 2022, France is estimated to have spent 1.89% of its GDP on military spending. French president Emmanuel Macron, this year in January, announced to raise France’s budget for 2024-2030 by 40% to get the armed forces ready for the possibility of high-intensity conflicts. Bloomberg reported recently that French aerospace group, Safran, is in talks with Raytheon Technologies Corporation (NYSE:RTX) to buy one of its flight control units for about $1 billion.8. CroatiaMilitary spending as share of GDP: 1.91%Croatia spent 1.91% of its GDP on defense expenditure in 2022. In December that year, the government approved procurement of French air defense system, Mistral, for $75 million. This deal followed last year’s purchase of Rafale jets from France worth over $1 billion, after an initial interest in Lockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE:LMT)’s F-35 fighter jets.7. LatviaMilitary spending as share of GDP: 2.07%We are now onto countries that met NATO’s military spending target in 2022. Latvia is one of the top NATO military spenders. It is one of the seven countries that is estimated to have spent over 2% of its GDP on defense. The country’s spending ratio was a paltry 0.94% in 2014 according to statistics released by NATO. However, in the last few years, the government has increased funding to equip the military with sophisticated weapons to strengthen national security. In June this year, Northrop Grumman Corporation (NYSE:NOC) announced that it had modernized Latvia’s air defense capabilities. The project was funded by the U.S. government for three Baltic countries, Latvia, Estonia, and Lithuania for $14.3 million.6. EstoniaMilitary spending as share of GDP: 2.12%Estonia borders Russia to its east. It is estimated to have spent 2.12% of its GDP on defense in 2022. Prime Minister Kaja Kallas announced in April this year that her government plans to raise military spending to 3% of the GDP for 2024-2027. The country’s military spending has been above NATO’s target consistently since 2015. BAE Systems plc in 2017 signed a contract with the Estonian government to support its fleet of infantry fighting vehicles, the CV9035.Click to continue reading and see NATO Military Spending by Country: Top 5 Countries.

32,a1d88d4b-35d4-3855-abd7-04c2a4f0045c,NEE,2023-06-11,7 Energy Stocks Powering Up for a Rally,InvestorPlace,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/7-energy-stocks-powering-rally-201550027.html,1685909750,STORY,"['NG=F', 'CL=F', 'CVX', 'VLO', 'OXY', 'DVN', 'HAL', 'NEE']","[The market is always forward-looking. That’s one explanation for the drop in energy stocks after a blowout year in 2022. There are some catalysts, however, that point to increased demand. That’s why now is the time to look for energy stocks with growth potential.  To begin with, OPEC appears to be ready to announce its second production cut in 2023. Simple supply and demand suggest that will be bullish for the price of crude oil. In fairness, OPEC cut production for the first time in April when oil was in the $70s. As of this writing, it’s in the $60s, so maybe the second time is the charm. Another catalyst for oil prices may come from the proposed Fiscal Responsibility Act (i.e. the debt ceiling bill). If approved, the bill will expedite the construction of the Mountain Valley Pipeline. It also omits proposals by progressive legislators to fast-track the construction of transmission lines that would accelerate the country’s transition away from fossil fuels. And once again, the market is forward-looking. That means energy stocks likely already factor in a recession late this year. That means now is the time to start looking at the best energy stocks for a rally. Here are 7 options for you to consider.  InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsOXYOccidental Petroleum$59.69CVXChevron$156.26NEENextEra$73.85HALHalliburton$31.64DVNDevon Energy$48.53VLOValero Energy$109.27SLBSchlumberger$46.77Occidental Petroleum (OXY) man's hand holding wads of cash. stocks to buy. Stocks With 1000% UpsideSource: Vova Shevchuk / Shutterstock.comWarren Buffett is credited with the advice for investors to “buy when others are fearful.” No matter how you feel about Warren Buffett, you have to give him credit for practicing what he preaches. Buffett’s hedge fund, Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRK-B) is a major shareholder of Occidental Petroleum (NYSE:OXY).   And so, when OXY stock was trading below $60 in March, Buffett pounced. And the company continued to buy the company’s shares in May. But what makes Occidental a favorite of Buffett? One reason is the company’s recent surge in free cash flow (FCF). The company is pledging to use some of the $1.7 billion in FCF it generated in the first quarter to buy back its shares. And the company also pays a juicy dividend that currently has a yield of 1.23%.  Story continuesOccidental Petroleum also deserves consideration as one of the energy stocks with growth potential because its objectively undervalued. OXY stock trades for a forward price-to-earnings ratio of just over 11x. Analysts give the stock a consensus price target of $68.96 which is a gain of approximately 20% from the stock’s current price.  Chevron (CVX) An image of a street sign post with directions labeled ""Buy"", ""Hold"", and ""Sell""Source: PX Media / ShutterstockAnother energy stock that is a favorite of Warren Buffett is Chevron (NYSE:CVX). It’s true that Buffett has sold some of his CVX stock position recently. And CVX stock tumbled as a result. The stock is down 15% in 2023 alone and down approximately 13% in the last 12 months.  But Buffett’s firm still has a significant position in the stock. That’s unlikely to change because Chevron has the same desirable characteristics as Occidental Petroleum. Specifically, the company has been buying back a significant amount of its own stock. And it pays a healthy dividend which has been increasing for 37 consecutive years. The company’s breakeven oil price is around $50. So even with the price of crude around $68, the company’s balance sheet is in great shape. Plus, the stock is trading for just 10.5x forward earnings.  Skeptics will say it’s foolish to invest in traditional oil stocks at this time. However, those investors are missing the larger plot. Companies like Chevron are already investing in renewable energy projects. In fairness, Chevron is taking a more measured approach, but it has the cash on hand to make a splash when it decides where it can have the most impact. Plus, the company is a major player in the transport of liquefied natural gas, which will remain high in demand as long as Russia’s war with Ukraine is ongoing.  NextEra Energy (NEE) Man holding stacks of money. Top millionaire-maker stocks to buySource: Epic Cure / ShutterstockNextEra Energy (NYSE:NEE) is the next stock on this list of energy stocks with growth potential. The company stands to be one of the largest beneficiaries from the proposed debt ceiling bill. The company contributed significantly to various Congressional leaders in March to attempt to get the Mountain Valley pipeline approved.  This should remind investors that NextEra Energy is a company that relies on fossil fuels and clean energy. All of the company’s clean energy projects are in the United States. This means the company will likely receive tax breaks based on the Inflation Reduction Act passed by Congress in 2022. In that regard, it’s a company that may well reflect the “all of the above” landscape that is likely to be the most productive path for this country’s energy needs. NEE stock is down almost 15% in 2023 and it trades at about 21x earnings. The company’s core business is to provide electricity to a wide geographic area that includes Florida as its largest service area. That gives the company attributes of both a growth stock and a value stock.   Halliburton (HAL) A person draws a stock chart on a chalkboard.Source: Zurijeta / Shutterstock.comHalliburton (NYSE:HAL) is a strong contender to be among the best energy stocks for a rally. To be fair, the oil services company will need to see more drilling in the oil patch. And HAL stock will be heavily affected by crude prices that remain under $70. The reopening of China is not the catalyst that many were expecting. But the need to refill the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, the likelihood of a pause in interest rate hikes, as well as OPEC making an additional production cut will be bullish for oil prices. In turn, HAL stock is likely to benefit.  HAL stock is down 23% in 2023, but at 13x earnings and 9x forward earnings, HAL stock is undervalued. Analysts seem to agree and give the stock a $48 price target. If that’s correct, it would push shares to a seven-year high.  Devon Energy (DVN) hands at desk near laptop computer, with one hand holding a pile of hundred dollar bills. Bank stocksSource: shutterstock.com/CC7Devon Energy (NYSE:DVN) is one of the most attractive stocks on this list of energy stocks with growth potential. The stock is trading near its 52-week low and it has a current P/E ratio of 5x earnings.  The independent oil and gas company delivered its first quarter earnings report in early May. It met expectations on the top line and beat the bottom line. But the key number was its oil production which came in at an all-time high of 320,000 barrels per day.  If as expected oil prices rise, Devon Energy will benefit from higher margins and increased profitability. The company is aggressively buying back its shares and increasing its dividend. These are both signs that management believes DVN stock is undervalued. And apparently so do analysts. The stock has a consensus price target of $63.96 which is a gain of approximately 45% from the stock’s price as of the market close on June 1, 2023.  Valero Energy (VLO) tree growing on coin of stacking with green bokeh background; growth stocksSource: Freedom365day / Shutterstock.comValero Energy (NYSE:VLO) is the largest independent refiner in North America. Since refining oil is needed for the gas we put in our cars, Valero would be a logical pick as one of the top-performing energy stocks. And with VLO stock trading near its 52-week low and at around 3x earnings, it’s one to watch. In addition to refining crude oil into gasoline or diesel fuel, Valero is one of the leading refiners of Ethanol. To date, this represents a small fraction of the company’s overall revenue.  And speaking of revenue, the company had a record revenue year in 2022. And that revenue came with record annual earnings per share of $29.26. In the first quarter of 2023, the company posted earnings per share of $8.27. That was nearly four times the EPS the company delivered in the first quarter of 2022. That’s particularly impressive considering the first quarter is typically the company’s weakest in terms of revenue and EPS. Schlumberger (SLB) Stocks to buy: smartphone with the words ""buy"" and ""sell"" displayed on the screen. The user's finger is about to press buy. Stock charts are in the background of the image.Source: Chompoo Suriyo / Shutterstock.comSchlumberger (NYSE:SLB) is best known to long-time investors as an oil services company that provides the equipment that companies need to drill. The stock’s poor performance over the past five years illustrates how sensitive the company is to oil prices.  Recently, Schlumberger rebranded itself as part of an attempt to make a pivot into carbon capture. The company seems late to the party on this transition. However, it could get a lift from rising oil prices. Manufacturers are spending a significant amount of money to electrify all forms of transportation. That investment alone makes it logical that oil prices will have a ceiling.  That being said, the global recession may be fully priced into oil. What is likely not priced in is the production issues – and elevated price tags – that are putting a ceiling on EV demand. SLB stock is not one to hold for the long term. But if you’re looking for energy stocks with growth potential in 2023 and 2024, it’s a name to watch.  On the date of publication, Chris Markoch had a LONG position in CVX.

36,2399dfae-291c-3cc3-b427-76acb884b198,LMT,2023-06-11,NATO Military Spending by Country: Top 20 Countries,Insider Monkey,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/nato-military-spending-country-top-093007390.html,1686475807,STORY,"['LMT', 'NOC', 'RTX', 'GD']","[In this article, we look at the military spending by country and create a list of the top 20 NATO countries that spend the highest on defense expenditure. To skip our detailed analysis, head directly to NATO Military Spending by Country: Top 5 Countries.Global military spending has reached a record high with $2.2 trillion spent on defense expenditure in 2022, with Europe seeing its steepest rise in 30 years amid Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. The three largest military spenders, the United States, China, and Russia, accounted for 56% of the world total. Military spending from NATO members increased by 0.9% from 2021, to a total of $1.2 trillion in 2022. These statistics were published by the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIRPI) in April this year.The surge in spending has created a boom for the armament manufacturing industry. Lockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE:LMT) reported net sales of $66 billion and a net profit of $5.7 billion in 2022. Raytheon Technologies Corporation (NYSE:RTX)’s net earnings for the year ended March 2023 were $14.1 billion – an increase of 8.90% from last year. Northrop Grumman Corporation (NYSE:NOC) also announced that its profits in 2022 had risen by 2.5% compared to 2021. The revenues of General Dynamics Corporation (NYSE:GD) and BAE Systems plc were also significantly higher than in the preceding year.NATO, the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, is an intergovernmental alliance between 31 countries with an integrated military command structure. 29 of its members are European, while two of them are North American. The alliance is sourced through direct and indirect contributions of members. NATO does not have its own armed forces. Members commit troops and equipment on a voluntary basis. There is no obligation for allies to contribute, unless Article 5 of the treaty is invoked, which calls for collective defense.NATO’s 2% Defense Expenditure GoalDefense Ministers of NATO countries in 2006 agreed for their countries to commit at least 2% of their GDP on defense expenditure. This decision was made to ensure NATO’s military readiness. By 2014, only three allies were meeting this goal. That number is now up to seven. The change has been driven by calls from the United States urging allies to increase defense spending by country to meet NATO’s target.Story continuesThe United States is the biggest military spender in the world. According to a report released by NATO this year, the U.S. is estimated to have spent more than $821 billion on defense expenditure in 2022 – the highest amount in the world, which is close to 40% of all global spending on defense in that year, and nearly three times higher than the amount spent by China, the world’s second biggest military spender.Another significant factor behind more NATO members increasing military spending is that European governments are actively taking measures to strengthen their defense following Russia’s annexation of Crimea in 2014, and the invasion of Ukraine in 2022. This is discussed in detail in our article, 20 Strongest Militaries in Europe. Germany, for instance, has announced to commit $112 billion to a special fund to bolster its armed forces and meet NATO’s spending target of 2% over the next few years. German lawmakers approved an order for 35 F-35A fifth-generation fighter jets from Lockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE:LMT), with the first set of planes set to arrive in 2027. This is one of the series of contracts, worth $13.8 billion, that were approved by the parliament last year.While governments that are part of NATO are taking steps to increase their military spending as share of GDP, only seven countries are meeting the target of 2%, and a vast majority are falling well below the goal. Luxembourg (0.62%), Spain (1.09%), Belgium (1.18%), Slovenia (1.26%), and Canada (1.29%) make the bottom of our list of military spending by country for NATO members. These are the NATO countries that spend the least share of their GDP on defense, considering that Iceland does not have a military and therefore, its spending is negligible. Türkiye, which has the second largest standing army in NATO, also spends a mere 1.37% of its GDP on defense and does not make the top 20 list.NATO’s Military Spending in UkraineMembers of NATO have been aggressively arming Kyiv to resist Russian advances. The United States is the largest NATO contributor to Ukraine, having spent $46.6 billion as of February 2023 in military assistance, according to data shared by the Council on Foreign Relations. By December 2022, Lockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE:LMT) had missile orders worth $950 million from Pentagon to refill stockpiles in Ukraine.Much of this amount was dedicated to the production of HIMARS and GMLRS. Earlier in the same year, Raytheon Technologies Corporation (NYSE:RTX) had been awarded a $624 million contract to build 1,300 stinger missiles for Ukraine. In January 2023, the U.S. announced to send 31 M1 Abrams tanks built by General Dynamics Corporation (NYSE:GD) in fresh military assistance to Ukraine.The United Kingdom is the second largest NATO contributor to Ukraine with over $7.5 billion pledged in military funding, followed by Germany at third. The UK announced to send 14 of its Challenger 2 tanks, while Germany said it would send 88 Leopard tanks to aid Ukraine’s fight against Russia.NATO’s 2023 military budget is $2.1 billion dollars. The United States, United Kingdom, and Germany have pledged to contribute nearly half of it – 43.9% to be precise. NATO’s chief has urged member nations to increase their share of military spending to at least 2% of the GDP.MethodologyWe have ranked the top 20 list of military spending by country for NATO members by sorting them based on countries’ defense spending as percentage of GDP. This metric is directly aligned with NATO’s requirement of countries having to spend at least 2% of their GDP on defense. The list has been prepared using data released by NATO this year on the estimated defense expenditures incurred by its members in 2022. Countries that had the same percentage of defense spending as share of GDP in 2022 were sorted based on their spending shares in the previous year. A country whose share had increased this year relative to last year outranked the country whose share of spending had decreased this year compared to last year.NATO Military Spending by Country: Top 20 CountriesPhoto by Kevin Schmid on UnsplashLet’s look at the top 20 NATO countries with the highest military spending as a percentage of their GDP.20. DenmarkMilitary spending as share of GDP: 1.38%Denmark is a Scandinavian country which only spends 1.38% of its GDP on defense expenditure. The government has announced to spend about 21 billion euros in the next ten years to meet NATO’s military spending by country target of 2%. Denmark is home to Terma Group, a company that produces defense systems such as command and control, radars, space technology, and aircraft self-protection systems. In 2022, it went into a contract with Northrop Grumman Corporation (NYSE:NOC) to cooperate on electronic warfare training opportunities in Northern Europe.19. HungaryMilitary spending as share of GDP: 1.44%The Hungarian government announced in June 2022 to raise its defense spending from $3 billion per year to $4.5 billion for 2023. Hungary has been taking active measures since 2019 to increase its military spending as percentage of GDP, which currently stands at a paltry 1.44%. In 2022, Hungary signed a deal with Raytheon Technologies Corporation (NYSE:RTX) to purchase air defense missiles worth $1 billion – which was Budapest’s largest defense procurement ever from the United States.18. GermanyMilitary spending as share of GDP: 1.49%According to NATO statistics, Germany is estimated to have spent only 1.49% of its GDP on defense in 2022. However, the government in Berlin is considering a written pledge to NATO for increasing its defense spending to at least 2% of the GDP. Germany has also committed itself to contributing 319 million euros to NATO’s 2023 military budget. Germany and United States, together, will be making up over 30% of the total budgetary amount of 1.96 billion euros.17. ItalyMilitary spending as share of GDP: 1.51%Italy is the 11th largest spender on military in the world in terms of monetary value, with a defense expenditure of $32 billion in 2022. However, this is only 1.51% of its GDP, which is over $2 trillion. Italy is fourth on the list of the 20 Strongest Militaries in Europe. Its air force has a fleet of 14 F-35 fifth-generation fighter jets and has placed an order with Lockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE:LMT) worth $524 million in 2022 for another 18 of these jets. On the naval side, it boasts 2 aircraft carrier warships – the Giuseppe Garibaldi and Cavour.16. BulgariaMilitary spending as share of GDP: 1.54%Bulgaria is estimated to have spent 1.54% of its GDP in 2022 on defense expenditure. According to a survey held by NATO this year, 83% of Bulgarians are in favor of their country increasing its military spending. The country is a key ally of the United States, which has spent over $238 million in military assistance to Bulgaria over the last five years. Eastern Europe’s first command and control center was built in Sofia, Bulgaria in 2004 by Northrop Grumman Corporation (NYSE:NOC).15. NorwayMilitary spending as share of GDP: 1.57%Norway’s military spending as percentage of GDP touched NATO’s 2% target in 2020 but has plummeted down to 1.57% in 2022 – the lowest since 2015. Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has, however, forced a rethink, with the country’s prime minister announcing to raise defense spending to 2% of the GDP by 2026. In November last year, the Norwegian government entered a contract with Lockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE:LMT) for its TPY-4 radars to boost its national defense.14. AlbaniaMilitary spending as share of GDP: 1.57%Albania had the same defense spending as share of GDP as Norway did in 2022 but outranked the latter due to its consistent growth in defense spending over the last few years. Barring a fraction of a dip in 2021, Albania’s spending has grown from 1.10% of the GDP in 2016 to 1.57% of the GDP in 2022. The country’s defense minister in May 2022 announced that his country had bought anti-tank javelin missiles from Lockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE:LMT) to strengthen the army. The cost and quantity were not disclosed.13. North MacedoniaMilitary spending as share of GDP: 1.61%North Macedonia is another country that is on upward trajectory as far as meeting NATO’s military spending by country target of 2% is concerned. Its military spending as share of GDP has consistently grown from 0.89% in 2017 to an estimated 1.61% in 2022. According to a report in Janes, the government in Skopje has approved a budget of $292 million for defense in 2023, with the aim of modernizing the armed forces.12. NetherlandsMilitary spending as share of GDP: 1.64%The Dutch government announced in late 2022 that it would be spending nearly $3.5 billion in military procurement in wake of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. This will not only help the Netherlands strengthen its defense, but is also expected to take its military spending share as percentage of GDP to above 2% by 2024.11. RomaniaMilitary spending as share of GDP: 1.75%Romania spent over 2% of its GDP on defense in 2020. That share is estimated to have dropped in 2022. However, the government is determined to increase military spending amid the ongoing Russia-Ukraine war. A senior official announced in March this year that Romania plans on submitting a request to the United States in 2024 for procurement of Lockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE:LMT)’s F-35 fighter jets. The parliament has also approved the purchase of 54 used M1A2 Abrams tanks, manufactured by General Dynamics Corporation (NYSE:GD), from the United States.10. Slovak RepublicMilitary spending as share of GDP: 1.76%Slovak Republic, also known as Slovakia, is the tenth biggest spender on military in terms of share of GDP. It is estimated by NATO to have spent 1.76% of its GDP on defense spending in 2022. This includes a $1.37 billion deal for the delivery of 152 infantry fighting vehicles from BAE Systems plc. The Slovakian government aims to achieve NATO’s 2% defense spending target in 2024.9. FranceMilitary spending as share of GDP: 1.89%France is one of the strongest militaries in the world, and Europe’s largest in terms of manpower. You can read more on it in our list of the most powerful militaries in the world in 2023. In 2022, France is estimated to have spent 1.89% of its GDP on military spending. French president Emmanuel Macron, this year in January, announced to raise France’s budget for 2024-2030 by 40% to get the armed forces ready for the possibility of high-intensity conflicts. Bloomberg reported recently that French aerospace group, Safran, is in talks with Raytheon Technologies Corporation (NYSE:RTX) to buy one of its flight control units for about $1 billion.8. CroatiaMilitary spending as share of GDP: 1.91%Croatia spent 1.91% of its GDP on defense expenditure in 2022. In December that year, the government approved procurement of French air defense system, Mistral, for $75 million. This deal followed last year’s purchase of Rafale jets from France worth over $1 billion, after an initial interest in Lockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE:LMT)’s F-35 fighter jets.7. LatviaMilitary spending as share of GDP: 2.07%We are now onto countries that met NATO’s military spending target in 2022. Latvia is one of the top NATO military spenders. It is one of the seven countries that is estimated to have spent over 2% of its GDP on defense. The country’s spending ratio was a paltry 0.94% in 2014 according to statistics released by NATO. However, in the last few years, the government has increased funding to equip the military with sophisticated weapons to strengthen national security. In June this year, Northrop Grumman Corporation (NYSE:NOC) announced that it had modernized Latvia’s air defense capabilities. The project was funded by the U.S. government for three Baltic countries, Latvia, Estonia, and Lithuania for $14.3 million.6. EstoniaMilitary spending as share of GDP: 2.12%Estonia borders Russia to its east. It is estimated to have spent 2.12% of its GDP on defense in 2022. Prime Minister Kaja Kallas announced in April this year that her government plans to raise military spending to 3% of the GDP for 2024-2027. The country’s military spending has been above NATO’s target consistently since 2015.

In response, many builders quickly ramped up their incentives, including offering ""mortgage rate buydowns."" While builders in fast-correcting markets like Reno and Austin had to go much further, and slashed new community home prices by 10%, 15%, or in some cases even 20%.Those incentives and price markdowns are working now: New home sales on the rise again, and builder cancellation rates normalized this spring.""Rate buy-downs turned reluctant borrowers to enthusiastic buyers... The post-pandemic homebuilding environment is not the post-apocalyptic wasteland that many were predicting last fall,"" wrote Deutsche Bank researchers in a report published last week.There's a growing optimism on Wall Street that incentives, like mortgage rate buydowns, will give homebuilders a housing market edge in not just 2023, but also as long as mortgage rates stay elevated. Not to mention, builders are facing limited competition as existing home supply remains tight amid the so-called ""lock-in effect."" After all, if homeowners sold and bought something new, they'd be trading in their 2% or 3% mortgage rate for a 6% or 7% handle.Simply put: Firms like Deutsche Bank think the housing market's next move is one where new construction is busy, while the existing/resale market remains constrained.That builder enthusiasm has translated into a rush among investors to buy homebuilder stocks, including a 55.9% year-to-date jump in the share price of PulteGroup. It's followed by Toll Brothers (up 46.9% this year), D.R. Horton (+25.7%), and Lennar (+24.2%).View this interactive chart on Fortune.comDuring the Pandemic Housing Boom—a period of seemingly unlimited housing demand—builders including KB Home, PulteGroup, and NVR achieved huge profit margins as they swiftly jacked up prices. Those fat profit margins gave builders the breathing room to reduce margins (i.e., cutting prices and/or aggressive rate buydowns) in pursuit of ""finding the market."" According to Deutsche Bank, many builders are offering mortgage rates in the 5.0% to 5.5% as they pay lenders for so-called ""mortgage rate buydowns.""Story continuesIn the eyes of Deutsche Bank, there's still more room for homebuilder stocks to run as the U.S. housing market remains ""under-built.""""We [have] quickly turned from being cautiously optimistic to decisively bullish on new residential construction,"" wrote Deutsche Bank researchers in their latest builder report. ""We expect solid demand for new housing to accompany a continuing normalization of margins and returns, and as book values grow, the stocks should generally move higher, but we see opportunity for stock selection.""In the report, Deutsche Bank researchers outlined their ""target price"" outlooks for a few homebuilders.

It has begun a search for a new CEO and named Charles Dadswell, senior vice president and general counsel, as interim chief executive. DeSouza will stay on in an advisory capacity until July 31, it said.Illumina's shares rose 2.2% to $204.98 in premarket trading on Monday. The company's shares have lost about 60% of their value since completing the Grail deal in 2021.The Grail deal ""has kept a lot of investors out of the stock"" TD Cowen analyst Dan Brennan said. ""With Francis now stepping aside, I think the certainty of a Grail exit definitely goes up.""Icahn in a tweet said he is happy with the recent changes at Illumina and considers them a ""very positive occurrence.""""The new additions to the board, the CEO transition, as well as the change of the Chairman, are significant positives that should drive value for all stakeholders and human health,"" he added.The proxy battle began in March and ended with a May vote in which Icahn won enough shareholder support to oust the board chair, John Thompson, and install his nominee, Andrew Teno. Icahn has said he wants former Illumina CEO Jay Flatley to return.DeSouza in a letter to employees on LinkedIn said, ""My belief in the potential of GRAIL’s potentially life-saving technology and the benefits of merging it with Illumina remains unshakeable.""Story continuesDeSouza's departure was not a foregone conclusion. He had secured more than twice the number of shareholder votes than his challenger received in the proxy vote, which could have given him enough legitimacy to hang on.Vicki Hollub, for instance, remains Occidental Petroleum's CEO after the company cut a deal with Icahn over board seats in 2020 and after Icahn cashed out two years later.Still, there is a history of CEOs leaving. Unilever Plc CEO Alan Jope announced plans to leave three months after hedge fund Trian Fund Management's Nelson Peltz joined the consumer giant's board last year.Illumina earlier this month filed an appeal against an order from the U.S. Federal Trade Commission that demanded it divest Grail on competition concerns.(Reporting by Lavanya Ahire in Bengaluru and Caroline Humer in New York; Additional reporting by Michael Erman in New Jersey, Anirban Sen in New York and Manas Mishra in Bengaluru; Editing by Mark Porter, Marguerita Choy and Edwina Gibbs)]"

40,2399dfae-291c-3cc3-b427-76acb884b198,NOC,2023-06-11,NATO Military Spending by Country: Top 20 Countries,Insider Monkey,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/nato-military-spending-country-top-093007390.html,1686475807,STORY,"['LMT', 'NOC', 'RTX', 'GD']","[In this article, we look at the military spending by country and create a list of the top 20 NATO countries that spend the highest on defense expenditure. To skip our detailed analysis, head directly to NATO Military Spending by Country: Top 5 Countries.Global military spending has reached a record high with $2.2 trillion spent on defense expenditure in 2022, with Europe seeing its steepest rise in 30 years amid Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. The three largest military spenders, the United States, China, and Russia, accounted for 56% of the world total. Military spending from NATO members increased by 0.9% from 2021, to a total of $1.2 trillion in 2022. These statistics were published by the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIRPI) in April this year.The surge in spending has created a boom for the armament manufacturing industry. Lockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE:LMT) reported net sales of $66 billion and a net profit of $5.7 billion in 2022. Raytheon Technologies Corporation (NYSE:RTX)’s net earnings for the year ended March 2023 were $14.1 billion – an increase of 8.90% from last year. Northrop Grumman Corporation (NYSE:NOC) also announced that its profits in 2022 had risen by 2.5% compared to 2021. The revenues of General Dynamics Corporation (NYSE:GD) and BAE Systems plc were also significantly higher than in the preceding year.NATO, the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, is an intergovernmental alliance between 31 countries with an integrated military command structure. 29 of its members are European, while two of them are North American. The alliance is sourced through direct and indirect contributions of members. NATO does not have its own armed forces. Members commit troops and equipment on a voluntary basis. There is no obligation for allies to contribute, unless Article 5 of the treaty is invoked, which calls for collective defense.NATO’s 2% Defense Expenditure GoalDefense Ministers of NATO countries in 2006 agreed for their countries to commit at least 2% of their GDP on defense expenditure. This decision was made to ensure NATO’s military readiness. By 2014, only three allies were meeting this goal. That number is now up to seven. The change has been driven by calls from the United States urging allies to increase defense spending by country to meet NATO’s target.Story continuesThe United States is the biggest military spender in the world. According to a report released by NATO this year, the U.S. is estimated to have spent more than $821 billion on defense expenditure in 2022 – the highest amount in the world, which is close to 40% of all global spending on defense in that year, and nearly three times higher than the amount spent by China, the world’s second biggest military spender.Another significant factor behind more NATO members increasing military spending is that European governments are actively taking measures to strengthen their defense following Russia’s annexation of Crimea in 2014, and the invasion of Ukraine in 2022. This is discussed in detail in our article, 20 Strongest Militaries in Europe. Germany, for instance, has announced to commit $112 billion to a special fund to bolster its armed forces and meet NATO’s spending target of 2% over the next few years. German lawmakers approved an order for 35 F-35A fifth-generation fighter jets from Lockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE:LMT), with the first set of planes set to arrive in 2027. This is one of the series of contracts, worth $13.8 billion, that were approved by the parliament last year.While governments that are part of NATO are taking steps to increase their military spending as share of GDP, only seven countries are meeting the target of 2%, and a vast majority are falling well below the goal. Luxembourg (0.62%), Spain (1.09%), Belgium (1.18%), Slovenia (1.26%), and Canada (1.29%) make the bottom of our list of military spending by country for NATO members. These are the NATO countries that spend the least share of their GDP on defense, considering that Iceland does not have a military and therefore, its spending is negligible. Türkiye, which has the second largest standing army in NATO, also spends a mere 1.37% of its GDP on defense and does not make the top 20 list.NATO’s Military Spending in UkraineMembers of NATO have been aggressively arming Kyiv to resist Russian advances. The United States is the largest NATO contributor to Ukraine, having spent $46.6 billion as of February 2023 in military assistance, according to data shared by the Council on Foreign Relations. By December 2022, Lockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE:LMT) had missile orders worth $950 million from Pentagon to refill stockpiles in Ukraine.Much of this amount was dedicated to the production of HIMARS and GMLRS. Earlier in the same year, Raytheon Technologies Corporation (NYSE:RTX) had been awarded a $624 million contract to build 1,300 stinger missiles for Ukraine. In January 2023, the U.S. announced to send 31 M1 Abrams tanks built by General Dynamics Corporation (NYSE:GD) in fresh military assistance to Ukraine.The United Kingdom is the second largest NATO contributor to Ukraine with over $7.5 billion pledged in military funding, followed by Germany at third. The UK announced to send 14 of its Challenger 2 tanks, while Germany said it would send 88 Leopard tanks to aid Ukraine’s fight against Russia.NATO’s 2023 military budget is $2.1 billion dollars. The United States, United Kingdom, and Germany have pledged to contribute nearly half of it – 43.9% to be precise. NATO’s chief has urged member nations to increase their share of military spending to at least 2% of the GDP.MethodologyWe have ranked the top 20 list of military spending by country for NATO members by sorting them based on countries’ defense spending as percentage of GDP. This metric is directly aligned with NATO’s requirement of countries having to spend at least 2% of their GDP on defense. The list has been prepared using data released by NATO this year on the estimated defense expenditures incurred by its members in 2022. Countries that had the same percentage of defense spending as share of GDP in 2022 were sorted based on their spending shares in the previous year. A country whose share had increased this year relative to last year outranked the country whose share of spending had decreased this year compared to last year.NATO Military Spending by Country: Top 20 CountriesPhoto by Kevin Schmid on UnsplashLet’s look at the top 20 NATO countries with the highest military spending as a percentage of their GDP.20. DenmarkMilitary spending as share of GDP: 1.38%Denmark is a Scandinavian country which only spends 1.38% of its GDP on defense expenditure. The government has announced to spend about 21 billion euros in the next ten years to meet NATO’s military spending by country target of 2%. Denmark is home to Terma Group, a company that produces defense systems such as command and control, radars, space technology, and aircraft self-protection systems. In 2022, it went into a contract with Northrop Grumman Corporation (NYSE:NOC) to cooperate on electronic warfare training opportunities in Northern Europe.19. HungaryMilitary spending as share of GDP: 1.44%The Hungarian government announced in June 2022 to raise its defense spending from $3 billion per year to $4.5 billion for 2023. Hungary has been taking active measures since 2019 to increase its military spending as percentage of GDP, which currently stands at a paltry 1.44%. In 2022, Hungary signed a deal with Raytheon Technologies Corporation (NYSE:RTX) to purchase air defense missiles worth $1 billion – which was Budapest’s largest defense procurement ever from the United States.18. GermanyMilitary spending as share of GDP: 1.49%According to NATO statistics, Germany is estimated to have spent only 1.49% of its GDP on defense in 2022. However, the government in Berlin is considering a written pledge to NATO for increasing its defense spending to at least 2% of the GDP. Germany has also committed itself to contributing 319 million euros to NATO’s 2023 military budget. Germany and United States, together, will be making up over 30% of the total budgetary amount of 1.96 billion euros.17. ItalyMilitary spending as share of GDP: 1.51%Italy is the 11th largest spender on military in the world in terms of monetary value, with a defense expenditure of $32 billion in 2022. However, this is only 1.51% of its GDP, which is over $2 trillion. Italy is fourth on the list of the 20 Strongest Militaries in Europe. Its air force has a fleet of 14 F-35 fifth-generation fighter jets and has placed an order with Lockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE:LMT) worth $524 million in 2022 for another 18 of these jets. On the naval side, it boasts 2 aircraft carrier warships – the Giuseppe Garibaldi and Cavour.16. BulgariaMilitary spending as share of GDP: 1.54%Bulgaria is estimated to have spent 1.54% of its GDP in 2022 on defense expenditure. According to a survey held by NATO this year, 83% of Bulgarians are in favor of their country increasing its military spending. The country is a key ally of the United States, which has spent over $238 million in military assistance to Bulgaria over the last five years. Eastern Europe’s first command and control center was built in Sofia, Bulgaria in 2004 by Northrop Grumman Corporation (NYSE:NOC).15. NorwayMilitary spending as share of GDP: 1.57%Norway’s military spending as percentage of GDP touched NATO’s 2% target in 2020 but has plummeted down to 1.57% in 2022 – the lowest since 2015. Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has, however, forced a rethink, with the country’s prime minister announcing to raise defense spending to 2% of the GDP by 2026. In November last year, the Norwegian government entered a contract with Lockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE:LMT) for its TPY-4 radars to boost its national defense.14.

The unprecedented speed at which COVID vaccines were developed during the pandemic meant that potential uncommon side-effects may not have been detected as readily as they might have been in traditionally longer trials.EMA has said that safety monitoring had not been compromised during the fast-track assessment.The EMA had registered almost 1.7 million spontaneous reports of suspected side-effects by May, which translates into about 0.2 for every 100 administered doses.Almost 768 million vaccine doses have been administered in the European Economic Area (EEA), which includes the 27 EU member states plus Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway.The most common temporary side-effects are headache, fever, fatigue and muscle pain.The EMA also monitors adverse events or illness after vaccination, and checks for frequencies that surpass normal rates in the non-vaccinated population.LIABILITYIt is not clear who would pay the legal costs or compensation if the plaintiff wins the case.Sources have said some of the EU's bulk purchase agreements with vaccine makers, including BioNTech-Pfizer, contained full or partial liability waivers for both legal costs and potential compensation, which could force EU governments to bear some of the costs.Like many countries, Germany also has a public sector financial support scheme for people who suffer permanent harm from vaccines, known as a no-fault compensation programme, but participation in the programme does not block someone seeking damages separately.The United States has granted manufacturers immunity from liability for COVID vaccines that receive regulatory approval.Rogert &amp; Ulbrich says it has filed about 250 cases for clients seeking damages for alleged side-effects of COVID-19 vaccines.Another law firm, Caesar-Preller, says it is representing 100 cases, with both firms saying separately they cover almost all cases in Germany between them.A handful of similar cases have been filed in Italy.($1 = 0.9289 euros) (Reporting by Ludwig Burger and Patricia Weiss; additional reporting by Emilio Parodi in Milan and Natalie Grover and Sam Tobin in London; editing by Josephine Mason and Mark Potter)]"

The Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model is the tool we will apply to do this. Models like these may appear beyond the comprehension of a lay person, but they're fairly easy to follow.We would caution that there are many ways of valuing a company and, like the DCF, each technique has advantages and disadvantages in certain scenarios. If you want to learn more about discounted cash flow, the rationale behind this calculation can be read in detail in the Simply Wall St analysis model. View our latest analysis for Molson Coors Beverage The CalculationWe are going to use a two-stage DCF model, which, as the name states, takes into account two stages of growth. The first stage is generally a higher growth period which levels off heading towards the terminal value, captured in the second 'steady growth' period. To begin with, we have to get estimates of the next ten years of cash flows. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.A DCF is all about the idea that a dollar in the future is less valuable than a dollar today, so we discount the value of these future cash flows to their estimated value in today's dollars:Story continues10-year free cash flow (FCF) forecast2023202420252026202720282029203020312032 Levered FCF ($, Millions) US$1.13bUS$1.14bUS$1.15bUS$1.36bUS$1.33bUS$1.32bUS$1.33bUS$1.34bUS$1.35bUS$1.37bGrowth Rate Estimate SourceAnalyst x6Analyst x5Analyst x3Analyst x1Analyst x1Est @ -0.66%Est @ 0.17%Est @ 0.75%Est @ 1.16%Est @ 1.45% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 7.2% US$1.1kUS$996US$935US$1.0kUS$941US$871US$814US$765US$722US$683(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$8.8bThe second stage is also known as Terminal Value, this is the business's cash flow after the first stage. For a number of reasons a very conservative growth rate is used that cannot exceed that of a country's GDP growth. In this case we have used the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield (2.1%) to estimate future growth. In the same way as with the 10-year 'growth' period, we discount future cash flows to today's value, using a cost of equity of 7.2%.Terminal Value (TV)= FCF2032 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$1.4b× (1 + 2.1%) ÷ (7.2%– 2.1%) = US$27bPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$27b÷ ( 1 + 7.2%)10= US$14bThe total value, or equity value, is then the sum of the present value of the future cash flows, which in this case is US$22b. In the final step we divide the equity value by the number of shares outstanding. Relative to the current share price of US$66.5, the company appears quite undervalued at a 36% discount to where the stock price trades currently. Valuations are imprecise instruments though, rather like a telescope - move a few degrees and end up in a different galaxy. Do keep this in mind.dcfImportant AssumptionsNow the most important inputs to a discounted cash flow are the discount rate, and of course, the actual cash flows. You don't have to agree with these inputs, I recommend redoing the calculations yourself and playing with them. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Molson Coors Beverage as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 7.2%, which is based on a levered beta of 0.861. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.SWOT Analysis for Molson Coors BeverageStrengthDebt is well covered by earnings and cashflows.WeaknessDividend is low compared to the top 25% of dividend payers in the Beverage market.OpportunityExpected to breakeven next year.Has sufficient cash runway for more than 3 years based on current free cash flows.Good value based on P/S ratio and estimated fair value.ThreatPaying a dividend but company is unprofitable.Next Steps:Whilst important, the DCF calculation shouldn't be the only metric you look at when researching a company. DCF models are not the be-all and end-all of investment valuation. Instead the best use for a DCF model is to test certain assumptions and theories to see if they would lead to the company being undervalued or overvalued. If a company grows at a different rate, or if its cost of equity or risk free rate changes sharply, the output can look very different. Can we work out why the company is trading at a discount to intrinsic value?

In its letter, the fund mentioned that investors may not fully grasp the magnitude of the risks posed by the US debt ceiling problems, but the primary worry lies in the potential macroeconomic repercussions that could arise from a resolution between political parties. Spare some time to check the fund’s top 5 holdings to know more about their top bets for 2023.In its Q1 2023 investor letter, Crescat Capital mentioned NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) and explained its insights for the company. Founded in 1993, NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) is a Santa Clara, California-based multinational technology company with a $957.6 billion market capitalization. NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) delivered a 165.29% return since the beginning of the year, while its 12-month returns are up by 128.41%. The stock closed at $387.70 per share on June 09, 2023.Here is what Crescat Capital has to say about NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) in its Q1 2023 investor letter:""Nvidia (NVDA): The Clear AI Winner to Everyone Now: It is very clear to us that Artificial Intelligence is in the speculative froth stage. Just like the Internet bubble in 2000, from an investment standpoint, we the think biggest threat from AI is to investors in the abundance of hyped-up overvalued technology businesses that are all perceived to be big future winners, even perhaps among the biggest past AI market share winners and perceived juggernauts. At current valuations, the tech stock leaders of the unprecedented prior 14-year cycle, who all claim AI as a key driver of their future business model, collectively have much more to lose than to gain in the ultimate reordering. Too many of these past tech winners are perceived to be big future winners once again in the emerging AI battle, which is simply not how it works. The really big future winners in AI are likely to be the much earlier-stage businesses that are highly successful in applying AI technology in totally new and disruptive ways. The truth is that the investing world at large has absolutely no clue who these companies are going to be yet.As historical evidence to support this thesis, two of the biggest disrupters from the Internet era were Google (GOOG,GOOGL) and Facebook (META). Both these companies did not even emerge until AFTER the tech bust.We would like to point out that Crescat featured Nvidia in its July 2014 investor letter and recommended it at a value investing conference to a group of money managers in June 2014 at a price of $4.73/share. That was the time to buy NVDA based on our model score and deep-dive fundamental analysis to get ahead of the AI craze, and we did it across our client portfolios. It led to an entire Rise of the Machines macro theme at Crescat. Nvidia went on to be the number one performing stock in the S&amp;P 500 for each of the next three years straight. We sold it after a 5-bagger based on a deteriorating model score. In hindsight, we sold too soon. If we had held it until now, it could have been an 80-bagger. Such is the curse of the too-extreme value investor, which rest assured, we are still trying to learn from and improve on. For now, with just under a $1 trillion market cap and a P/E of 184, we believe the stock has overshot. Nvidia scores only in the 44th percentile in our overall fundamental model rank today and a low 11th percentile in our more-narrow value-rank component. We would caution strongly against buying it here.""Story continuesPhoto by Christian Wiediger on UnsplashOur calculations show that NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) ranks 10th on our list of the 30 Most Popular Stocks Among Hedge Funds.

However, as with many growth stocks from late 2021 until now, investors have punished the valuation of Block, cutting the share price around 80% from all-time highs.Check Out: 9 Safe Investments With the Highest ReturnsI’m a Self-Made Millionaire: Here Are 5 Stocks I’m Never SellingBut the underlying business fundamentals of the company remain strong, presenting investors with what might be an attractive entry point.As the company’s name change suggests, it has been moving deeper into blockchain applications, and it also moved into the “buy now, pay later” segment of fintech. If the company can get all of its ducks in a row, it could end up being the dominant player in the industry.JHVEPhoto / Getty ImagesShopify (SHOP)Price as of July 13th, 2023: $70.37Story continuesAdd Shopify to the list of high-growth stocks that have fallen back to Earth over the last two years, with shares now sitting about 60% off their highs.In the last few quarters, the e-commerce stock has been dealing with a much more challenging environment than it faced in the height of the pandemic. Under these circumstances, growth has slowed, and Shopify has had to take measures to cut costs.Earlier this month, it laid off nearly a fifth of its global workforce. It also sold off its logistics business, a major change in strategy that brings the company closer to its original asset-light business model. If these steps are effective, the company could be poised for a return to high growth.I’m a Financial Advisor: 7 Ways To Get Rich in Your Later YearsFritz Jorgensen / Getty ImagesMeta Platforms, Inc (META)Price as of July 13th, 2023: $313.41The last few years have been a real roller coaster for the company formerly known as Facebook.After Mark Zuckerberg went all-in on the “metaverse,” including a name change and tens of billions of dollars of spending, investors left the stock in droves and the price cratered, going from nearly $380 a share to a low near $88.The company has since stepped back, with Zuckerberg signaling that the business would put more focus back on its advertising business, which actually makes money.It’s impossible to predict if Meta’s virtual reality ambitions will come to fruition, but the stock has already climbed back to the high $200’s, and there’s reason to believe it’s on a path back to a trillion-dollar valuation.Rafael Henrique/SOPA Images/Shutterstock / Rafael Henrique/SOPA Images/ShutterstockSea Limited (SE)Price as of July 13th, 2023: $63.06Sea Limited has often been dubbed the “Amazon of Southeast Asia,” and that alone makes it worth watching. That region of the world has a rapidly growing consumer class, or at least it did until the coronavirus pandemic struck.Combined with the general abandonment of Chinese shares by market participants, a high valuation and its lack of profitability, Sea Limited shares have suffered badly, now sitting more than 80% below their all-time high. But the company’s still-rapid growth and plans to expand its e-commerce offering to Latin America and Europe could prove to be huge opportunities for the company.In addition to its popular e-commerce site Shopee, the company also draws revenue from its mobile game publisher Garena and its payment processing platform Sea Money.Nvidia (NVDA)Price as of July 13th, 2023: $459.77Nvidia has been a tech market leader for years now, and its growth seems unstoppable. The chip maker has been in the right place with the right product at the right time, and its stock price has reflected this.After taking a big hit to its multiple at the end of 2021 and the beginning of 2022, Nvidia’s stock went on a tear and powered its way to a new all-time high, even briefly cracking the trillion-dollar barrier.Among other things, Nvidia produces graphics processing units (GPUs) that are essential to the video game industry and are used to mine cryptocurrencies. The company also produces chip sets that power everything from robotics to self-driving cars. As all of these AI-adjacent industries are hot growth areas, Nvidia seems likely to continue at its torrid pace.Jakub Porzycki/NurPhoto/Shutterstock / Jakub Porzycki/NurPhoto/ShutterstockAirbnb (ABNB)Price as of July 13th, 2023: $140.09Airbnb is already a titan in a very highly fragmented industry, with a market share of about 20% of the entire rental vacation market. One of its key competitive advantages is an asset-light business model — it acts as a platform to connect guests and hosts rather than owning and operating its own hotels or vacation homes.In the long-term, Airbnb’s success will depend on the uncertain future of the travel industry, but if you are optimistic about that future, you now have the opportunity to buy Airbnb’s stock at a price below the $146 mark it reached on its first day of trading.I’m a Financial Advisor: Here Are 6 Things My Clients Don’t Like to Hear — and Why I Tell Them AnywayII.studio / Shutterstock.comEverquote (EVER)Price as of July 13th, 2023: $7.06Everquote is definitely a high-risk, high-reward play. The online provider of insurance quotes provides aggregated information from a variety of providers to allow consumers to choose where they want to buy their auto, home, medical, life, renters or commercial insurance products.Shares are down more than 80% from their all-time highs, as investors have been disappointed with results over the last year and a half, and growth stocks in general have gotten hammered.Yet, analysts still have a consensus “buy” rating on the stock, with an average price target of $12.00, or about 31% above current levels. If the company can execute on its vision to be the dominant provider of online insurance quotes, it could end up being the Amazon of its industry.©OpendoorOpendoor Technologies (OPEN)Price as of July 13th, 2023: $4.83Called the “Amazon of houses” by some, Opendoor Technologies is a potentially very risky stock that could be a huge winner if it can manage its business successfully over the long run.The online real estate innovator went public in the summer of 2020 and the stock rose quickly, but when fears over high-growth stocks with no profits took over the market at the end of 2021, Opendoor got swept up in the selloff.Believers cite the company’s strong growth rate in a nascent industry that has the potential to become the “new normal” for real estate transactions. However, currently the company is not profitable, and there are no guarantees it will get there. Whether or not that comes to fruition will determine whether Opendoor Technologies becomes “the next Amazon” or falls by the wayside.Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.comDocusign (DOCU)Price as of July 13th, 2023: $53.93Docusign’s stock started getting pummeled in late 2021 due to a variety of factors. In addition to the general trend of rising interest rates hurting growth stock multiples, analysts and investors alike jumped ship over worries that Docusign’s growth would fall off when the pandemic ended.Docusign bulls argue that Docusign was growing rapidly even before the pandemic juiced revenue, and that the demand for digitally signed documents will continue to rise.Docusign has been deepening its relationship with Salesforce and Microsoft and is being integrated into their tools like Slack and Microsoft Teams, which bodes well for its future. With the stock down over 80% from the all-time high of $310.05, Docusign could offer an attractive risk-to-reward proposition for speculative investors.Rafael Henrique/SOPA Images/Shutterstock / Rafael Henrique/SOPA Images/ShutterstockStoneCo (STNE)Price as of July 13th, 2023: $12.85Would you be interested in a stock owned by Warren Buffet’s Berkshire Hathaway that trades at almost 90% off of its all-time high? What if it was in the trendy fintech industry? If so, then StoneCo might be just what you’re looking for.The Brazil-based payment processing company provides a cloud-based technology platform to assist businesses with their electronic commerce needs. Like most of the high-flying growth stocks in this list, StoneCo’s shares were wiped out due to a combination of Brazilian economic uncertainty, a lack of profitability, and the general trend against high-multiple stocks in 2021 and 2022.But the core business of StoneCo remains strong, and the opportunity for fintech companies is great in countries like Brazil, which lack the traditional banking infrastructure of more developed companies.More From GOBankingRatesCash App Borrow: How to Borrow Money on Cash AppHow To Get Free Money: 13 Proven Ways3 Things You Must Do When Your Savings Reach $50,000Experts: Here's Why Nearly Every Purchase Should Be On a Credit CardCameron Diiorio contributed to the reporting for this article.This article originally appeared on GOBankingRates.com: 10 Valuable Stocks That Could Be the Next Apple or Amazon]"

This will be done using the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model. Before you think you won't be able to understand it, just read on! It's actually much less complex than you'd imagine.We would caution that there are many ways of valuing a company and, like the DCF, each technique has advantages and disadvantages in certain scenarios. If you want to learn more about discounted cash flow, the rationale behind this calculation can be read in detail in the Simply Wall St analysis model. Check out our latest analysis for Genuine Parts Is Genuine Parts Fairly Valued?We are going to use a two-stage DCF model, which, as the name states, takes into account two stages of growth. The first stage is generally a higher growth period which levels off heading towards the terminal value, captured in the second 'steady growth' period. To begin with, we have to get estimates of the next ten years of cash flows. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.Generally we assume that a dollar today is more valuable than a dollar in the future, and so the sum of these future cash flows is then discounted to today's value:Story continues10-year free cash flow (FCF) forecast2023202420252026202720282029203020312032 Levered FCF ($, Millions) US$1.03bUS$1.31bUS$1.16bUS$1.37bUS$1.60bUS$1.69bUS$1.78bUS$1.85bUS$1.91bUS$1.97bGrowth Rate Estimate SourceAnalyst x4Analyst x5Analyst x3Analyst x2Analyst x1Est @ 6.15%Est @ 4.94%Est @ 4.09%Est @ 3.50%Est @ 3.08% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 8.2% US$955US$1.1kUS$916US$999US$1.1kUS$1.1kUS$1.0kUS$982US$939US$894(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$9.9bWe now need to calculate the Terminal Value, which accounts for all the future cash flows after this ten year period. The Gordon Growth formula is used to calculate Terminal Value at a future annual growth rate equal to the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield of 2.1%. We discount the terminal cash flows to today's value at a cost of equity of 8.2%.Terminal Value (TV)= FCF2032 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$2.0b× (1 + 2.1%) ÷ (8.2%– 2.1%) = US$33bPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$33b÷ ( 1 + 8.2%)10= US$15bThe total value, or equity value, is then the sum of the present value of the future cash flows, which in this case is US$25b. The last step is to then divide the equity value by the number of shares outstanding. Relative to the current share price of US$156, the company appears about fair value at a 12% discount to where the stock price trades currently. Remember though, that this is just an approximate valuation, and like any complex formula - garbage in, garbage out.dcfThe AssumptionsNow the most important inputs to a discounted cash flow are the discount rate, and of course, the actual cash flows. Part of investing is coming up with your own evaluation of a company's future performance, so try the calculation yourself and check your own assumptions. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Genuine Parts as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 8.2%, which is based on a levered beta of 1.031. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.SWOT Analysis for Genuine PartsStrengthEarnings growth over the past year exceeded the industry.Debt is well covered by earnings and cashflows.Dividends are covered by earnings and cash flows.WeaknessDividend is low compared to the top 25% of dividend payers in the Retail Distributors market.OpportunityAnnual earnings are forecast to grow for the next 3 years.Current share price is below our estimate of fair value.ThreatAnnual earnings are forecast to grow slower than the American market.Next Steps:Whilst important, the DCF calculation ideally won't be the sole piece of analysis you scrutinize for a company. It's not possible to obtain a foolproof valuation with a DCF model. Preferably you'd apply different cases and assumptions and see how they would impact the company's valuation. For example, changes in the company's cost of equity or the risk free rate can significantly impact the valuation.

One way to achieve this is by employing the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model. Don't get put off by the jargon, the math behind it is actually quite straightforward.Companies can be valued in a lot of ways, so we would point out that a DCF is not perfect for every situation.

For a number of reasons a very conservative growth rate is used that cannot exceed that of a country's GDP growth. In this case we have used the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield (2.1%) to estimate future growth. In the same way as with the 10-year 'growth' period, we discount future cash flows to today's value, using a cost of equity of 8.9%.Terminal Value (TV)= FCF2032 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$23b× (1 + 2.1%) ÷ (8.9%– 2.1%) = US$351bPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$351b÷ ( 1 + 8.9%)10= US$149bThe total value is the sum of cash flows for the next ten years plus the discounted terminal value, which results in the Total Equity Value, which in this case is US$240b. In the final step we divide the equity value by the number of shares outstanding. Compared to the current share price of US$91.9, the company appears a touch undervalued at a 30% discount to where the stock price trades currently. Valuations are imprecise instruments though, rather like a telescope - move a few degrees and end up in a different galaxy. Do keep this in mind.dcfImportant AssumptionsThe calculation above is very dependent on two assumptions. The first is the discount rate and the other is the cash flows. If you don't agree with these result, have a go at the calculation yourself and play with the assumptions. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Walt Disney as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 8.9%, which is based on a levered beta of 1.144. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.SWOT Analysis for Walt DisneyStrengthEarnings growth over the past year exceeded the industry.Debt is well covered by earnings.WeaknessNo major weaknesses identified for DIS.OpportunityAnnual earnings are forecast to grow faster than the American market.Trading below our estimate of fair value by more than 20%.ThreatDebt is not well covered by operating cash flow.Annual revenue is forecast to grow slower than the American market.Moving On:Valuation is only one side of the coin in terms of building your investment thesis, and it ideally won't be the sole piece of analysis you scrutinize for a company.

You can skip our detailed analysis of the corporate litigation dynamics in the US and go directly to the 5 Most Litigious Companies in America.Legal battles have become an expensive and often unavoidable part of the business world, where companies find themselves caught up in disagreements. This results in significant financial losses, disruptions to operations, and continuous legal activity that can harm the company's reputation and how people perceive its brand.A new study by Acritas, now part of Thomson Reuters, reveals that US companies, on average, spend approximately 0.4% of their revenue on legal services, which is a staggering 166% higher than their global counterparts. Lisa Hart Shepherd, chief executive officer of Acritas said this: “Generally, the US is a much more litigious country” The enormous financial burden cripples companies, particularly smaller ones with limited resources, potentially diverting funds that could otherwise be allocated to innovation, expansion, or employee development. In 2012, technology giant Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) found itself embroiled in a high-stakes patent infringement lawsuit against Samsung Electronics. After a protracted legal battle, a jury awarded Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) over $1 billion in damages, a significant blow to Samsung.Amidst this landscape, certain courts have gained prominence for their expertise and reputation in resolving complex corporate cases. One such court is the Delaware Chancery Court. Known for its specialized knowledge and experience in corporate law, the Delaware Chancery Court attracts a wide range of litigants, including both large multinational companies and smaller entities. The court's reputation stems from its ability to handle high-stakes disputes efficiently and impartially.A notable case that highlights the significance of the Delaware Chancery Court is the Twitter acquisition lawsuit. Twitter took legal action against Elon Musk when he backed out of the $44 billion deal to buy the social media company. However, Musk closed the deal and acquired Twitter based on the original agreement before the court's decision. Story continuesWithin the litigation industry, trends in trademark, copyright, and patent infringement cases have emerged, influencing law firms and legal advisors. The 2019 Litigation Trends Annual Survey reveals a notable increase in demand for legal advisors, as indicated by a 17% growth in the size of in-house legal teams. This positive trend is accompanied by a minimal 2% decrease in team sizes. Additionally, the quantity of patent litigation cases is often influenced by economic factors, such as the general level of business activity and investment.These industry trends provide valuable insights into the evolving landscape of litigation and the strategies adopted by companies to navigate legal challenges. As litigation continues to shape the business environment, companies must carefully consider their legal approaches and seek experienced counsel to safeguard their interests.How Big is the Legal Industry in the US?The market share of the legal industry in the US is approximately $373 billion. The global market value of the legal industry is $713 billion, with North America accounting for 55% of this share, with Canada having a market size of $19 billion.Some of the top law firms in the US are Kirkland &amp; Ellis, Latham &amp; Watkins and DLA Piper, among others, with Kirkland &amp; Ellis being the biggest law firm in America.12 Most Litigious Companies in AmericaRalf Kleemann/Shutterstock.comOur MethodologyFor our list, we gathered data from several reputable sources, including Nowland Law and Patexia, among others. We ranked the most litigious companies in America in ascending order based on the highest cases filed during the period from 2009 to 2023.

For the remaining companies, our data was sourced from Nowland Law's report, which specifically listed litigious companies from the period of 2009 to 2016. However, we had a higher consideration for companies that were actively involved in litigation beyond the year 2016. That said, the methodology has its limitations. Without any delay, let’s dive into our extensive compilation of the 12 most litigious companies in America:12. Dominion HarborCase filed: 63Dominion Harbor Enterprises is a prominent intellectual property transaction and advisory firm, specializing in assisting clients with their IP-related needs. Dominion Harbor Enterprises, LLC has been actively involved in legal disputes, particularly in the area of intellectual property.

And the group that holds the biggest piece of the pie are institutions with 83% ownership. In other words, the group stands to gain the most (or lose the most) from their investment into the company.Since institutional have access to huge amounts of capital, their market moves tend to receive a lot of scrutiny by retail or individual investors. Hence, having a considerable amount of institutional money invested in a company is often regarded as a desirable trait.Let's delve deeper into each type of owner of Colgate-Palmolive, beginning with the chart below. View our latest analysis for Colgate-Palmolive ownership-breakdownWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Colgate-Palmolive?Institutions typically measure themselves against a benchmark when reporting to their own investors, so they often become more enthusiastic about a stock once it's included in a major index. We would expect most companies to have some institutions on the register, especially if they are growing.As you can see, institutional investors have a fair amount of stake in Colgate-Palmolive. This suggests some credibility amongst professional investors. But we can't rely on that fact alone since institutions make bad investments sometimes, just like everyone does. If multiple institutions change their view on a stock at the same time, you could see the share price drop fast. It's therefore worth looking at Colgate-Palmolive's earnings history below. Of course, the future is what really matters.earnings-and-revenue-growthSince institutional investors own more than half the issued stock, the board will likely have to pay attention to their preferences. Colgate-Palmolive is not owned by hedge funds. The Vanguard Group, Inc. is currently the company's largest shareholder with 9.7% of shares outstanding. For context, the second largest shareholder holds about 8.2% of the shares outstanding, followed by an ownership of 5.8% by the third-largest shareholder.Story continuesOn studying our ownership data, we found that 25 of the top shareholders collectively own less than 50% of the share register, implying that no single individual has a majority interest.While it makes sense to study institutional ownership data for a company, it also makes sense to study analyst sentiments to know which way the wind is blowing. There are plenty of analysts covering the stock, so it might be worth seeing what they are forecasting, too.Insider Ownership Of Colgate-PalmoliveThe definition of company insiders can be subjective and does vary between jurisdictions. Our data reflects individual insiders, capturing board members at the very least. Management ultimately answers to the board. However, it is not uncommon for managers to be executive board members, especially if they are a founder or the CEO.Insider ownership is positive when it signals leadership are thinking like the true owners of the company. However, high insider ownership can also give immense power to a small group within the company. This can be negative in some circumstances.Our information suggests that Colgate-Palmolive Company insiders own under 1% of the company. As it is a large company, we'd only expect insiders to own a small percentage of it. But it's worth noting that they own US$67m worth of shares. It is always good to see at least some insider ownership, but it might be worth checking if those insiders have been selling. General Public OwnershipThe general public-- including retail investors -- own 17% stake in the company, and hence can't easily be ignored. While this size of ownership may not be enough to sway a policy decision in their favour, they can still make a collective impact on company policies.Next Steps:It's always worth thinking about the different groups who own shares in a company. But to understand Colgate-Palmolive better, we need to consider many other factors. Consider risks, for instance. Every company has them, and we've spotted   3 warning signs for Colgate-Palmolive   you should know about.If you are like me, you may want to think about whether this company will grow or shrink.

One proposal asking Mastercard (MA) to disclose the risks of handling law enforcement requests for abortion-related customer data is scheduled for a vote on June 27.Votes were cast by shareholders of some of the country’s most prominent companies, including Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL), Meta (META), Walmart (WMT), Home Depot (HD), Pfizer (PFE), Abbvie (ABBV), Costco (COST), and Coca-cola (KO).Here's a closer look at those results:Anti-ESGThe lack of support is part of a wider pushback against proposals that demand action on a variety of environmental, social, and governance (ESG) issues ranging from corporate diversity to carbon emissions.In fact, conservative-leaning shareholders have pushed a record number of anti-ESG proposals during recent proxy seasons, a time in the spring and summer when shareholders seek votes on specific proposals.The number of anti-ESG resolutions on corporate ballots between January 1 through May 31 rose by more than 400% from 2020 to 2023, according to ISS Corporate Solutions. That helped drive the volume of shareholder proposals up by 14 percent during that period.Story continuesProtesters outside the Supreme Court in June 2022. (AP Photo/Jacquelyn Martin, File) (ASSOCIATED PRESS)Activists first gave renewed attention to reproductive rights last year when the Supreme Court overturned the landmark 1973 Roe vs. Wade decision that guaranteed American women the federal constitutional right to an abortion.A leak of the court's draft majority opinion last May triggered some of the first abortion-related proposals. The number of reproductive rights proposals then doubled to roughly 31 between the 2022 and 2023 proxy seasons.'More momentum'One activist investor who encountered pushback from shareholders this year was Arjuna Capital, which was responsible for abortion-related proposals at CVS (CVS), United Parcel Service (UPS), Costco (COST), Meta, and Alphabet.Arjuna argued for the proposals at tech companies like Meta and Alphabet because they are huge arbiters of data. Shareholders for both companies voted down measures that would have required them to assess and minimize how much abortion-related customer data is shared with law enforcement.Shareholders in UPS and Costco similarly voted 'no' to measures that would have required the businesses to report risks caused by state policies restricting reproductive rights, as well as possible mitigation strategies.The latest defeat came on Wednesday when Comcast shareholders decided against a measure asking the telecom giant to regularly disclose its political donations to anti-abortion politicians and organizations that conflict with its publicly stated values.Arjuna Capital managing partner Natasha Lamb. (AP Photo/Steven Senne) (ASSOCIATED PRESS)Arjuna, however, did succeed in securing new data protection practices at CVS. Negotiations concerning its proposal led the healthcare company to agree to expand privacy protections around consumer health data.“While the proposals have not garnered majority support thus far, the more important outcome is to get companies and investors considering how restricting reproductive freedoms carries inherent business risk,” Arjuna managing partner Natasha Lamb said.ISS said the votes track with an overall drop in enthusiasm for all shareholder proposals in 2023.""When all is said and done, we expect support for shareholder proposals to be down over past years and potentially closer to pre-pandemic norms,” said Jun Frank, managing director at ISS Corporate Solutions.Lamb said she is not giving up.""Unfortunately, the business risks from restricting reproductive freedoms are not going away anytime soon,"" she said, ""and we expect more momentum on this issue heading into the next proxy season.""Alexis Keenan is a legal reporter for Yahoo Finance.

(NYSE:PRU) insiders sold a significant stake in the company which may have piqued investors' interest. When evaluating insider transactions, knowing whether insiders are buying versus if they selling is usually more beneficial, as the latter can be open to many interpretations. However, shareholders should take a deeper look if several insiders are selling stock over a specific time period.While insider transactions are not the most important thing when it comes to long-term investing, logic dictates you should pay some attention to whether insiders are buying or selling shares. Check out our latest analysis for Prudential Financial Prudential Financial Insider Transactions Over The Last YearOver the last year, we can see that the biggest insider sale was by the Executive VP and Head of International Businesses &amp; PGIM, Andrew Sullivan, for US$1.2m worth of shares, at about US$101 per share. We generally don't like to see insider selling, but the lower the sale price, the more it concerns us. It's of some comfort that this sale was conducted at a price well above the current share price, which is US$84.55. So it is hard to draw any strong conclusion from it.Insiders in Prudential Financial didn't buy any shares in the last year. You can see a visual depiction of insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last 12 months, below. If you click on the chart, you can see all the individual transactions, including the share price, individual, and the date!insider-trading-volumeIf you like to buy stocks that insiders are buying, rather than selling, then you might just love this free list of companies. (Hint: insiders have been buying them).Insider OwnershipI like to look at how many shares insiders own in a company, to help inform my view of how aligned they are with insiders. We usually like to see fairly high levels of insider ownership. Insiders own 0.2% of Prudential Financial shares, worth about US$54m. This level of insider ownership is good but just short of being particularly stand-out. It certainly does suggest a reasonable degree of alignment.Story continuesWhat Might The Insider Transactions At Prudential Financial Tell Us?There haven't been any insider transactions in the last three months -- that doesn't mean much. Our analysis of Prudential Financial insider transactions leaves us cautious. The modest level of insider ownership is, at least, some comfort. While we like knowing what's going on with the insider's ownership and transactions, we make sure to also consider what risks are facing a stock before making any investment decision. In terms of investment risks, we've identified 3 warning signs with Prudential Financial and understanding them should be part of your investment process.Of course, you might find a fantastic investment by looking elsewhere.

For more stocks, head on over to 5 Momentum Stocks Billionaires Are Loading Up On. Just as there are countless different sectors of stocks for every flavor of economic sentiment, there are a variety of different approaches to investment as well. Broadly speaking, investing can be bifurcated into two categories. These are playing the fundamentals and playing the technicals. And while the latter is often dependent on the former, it is possible to isolate them and focus only on one strategy.Investing with the fundamentals involves an understanding of a firm's balance sheet and its market performance. Companies with stable cash flows, significant share price ratios to their earnings, large growing markets, and countless other metrics are often preferred depending on the investing strategy. Investing with technicals is a graph-based game that looks at share price trends, market sentiment measured through the volume of shares traded, and a handful of other metrics.These days, the macroeconomic environment is one of the most watched indicators. Specifically, investors are wondering if there will be a recession in America and how effective the Federal Reserve's fight against inflation has been. For the latter, June has proven to be an interesting month. Economy watchers were left confused when the May jobs report from the Labor Department revealed that while the number of jobs grew, the unemployment rate also ticked up. However, as the second week of June kicked in, the market was dealt a pleasant surprise.The Labor Department came out with some good news (at least for investors) in its unemployment insurance claims report. Its data showed that the initial claims for the week ending on June 3rd were 261,000 marking a 28,000 jump from the prior week. According to the department, the only time in recent history the number of claims was higher was during the coronavirus pandemic when the claims at the end of October 2021 stood at 264,000. State wise, California accounted for half of the weekly jump, reporting 5,173 additional non seasonally adjusted claims.Story continuesThe market, safe to say, was ecstatic. Economists polled by Reuters had expected the claims figure to come in at 235,000 so the data beat expectations by quite a margin. However, before you get too enthusiastic, keep in mind that economists are also urging caution, as the numbers are quite volatile on a weekly basis and since the data is dominated by a handful of states instead of being a broader occurrence. Some also believe that the data might also be influenced by automakers' seasonal shutdown of plants to retool their machines.Turning to the markets, the NASDAQ jumped by 89 basis points while the NASDAQ 100 rose by a little over one percent. This is because the technology sector is one of the most sensitive ones to high interest rates and the latest release hints that perhaps the Federal Reserve might exercise more restraint. The S&amp;P500 marked a smaller, 49 basis point increase while the NYSE Composite was up by 12 basis points. However, the Russell 2000 index was down by 49 basis points, since the latest data also points to an economic slowdown which often negatively affects small-cap companies.So how to play these recent market trends? Well, on the technical side of investing, one popular strategy is momentum investing. Simply put, momentum investing involves taking a look at recent price trends to determine if there are a sufficient number of buyers and sellers of stock and if their interest can create a self sustained period of price movements that can be leveraged for profit. The seminal work on momentum investing, and one that laid the ground work for today's strategy, was a research paper from Narasimhan Jegadeesh and Sheridan Titman published in The Journal of Finance March 1993 edition. This paper examined NYSE and AMSE stocks between 1965 and 1989 and the results of sixteen trading strategies that picked stocks on the basis of historical stock returns ranging from one to four quarters. All the strategies that the researchers studied yielded positive results, leading them to conclude:Trading strategies that buy past winners and sell past losers realize significant abnormal returns over the 1965 to 1989 period. For example, the strategy we examine in most detail, which selects stocks based on their past 6-month returns and holds them for 6 months, realizes a compounded excess return of 12.01% per year on average. Additional evidence indicates that the profitability of the relative strength strategies are not due to their systematic risk. The results of our tests also indicate that the relative strength profits cannot be attributed to lead-lag effects that result from delayed stock price reactions to common factors. The evidence is, however, consistent with de- layed price reactions to firm-specific information.So, it appears that there are indeed quite a lot of benefits when taking a momentum based approach to investing. Naturally, this led us to take a look at some momentum stocks that billionaires are buying and some top picks are Campbell Soup Company (NYSE:CPB), AutoZone, Inc. (NYSE:AZO), and Mettler-Toledo International Inc. (NYSE:MTD).Momentum Stocks Billionaires Are Loading Up OnOur Methodology To make our list of the momentum stocks being bought by billionaires, we used three indicators - the relative strength index (RSI), the average volume, and the 50-day simple moving average. The RSI measures how fast a stock's price is rising or falling, the average volume analyzes whether the shares traded are above typical levels, and the 50-day simple moving average smooths out price fluctuations. Through these, we first narrowed down to an initial list of stocks based on criteria that looks whether the stock's 50-day moving average was above the 200-day moving average, whether the RSI indicated an oversold stock, and if its relative volume was twice the normal levels. Finally, to ensure that only quality stocks were included, stocks with only recommended Hold or better ratings were picked. This presented us with an initial list of 20 momentum stocks with the best analyst ratings. We then used Insider Monkey's database of billionaire-owned stocks and choose 10 out of these 20 stocks with the highest number of billionaire investors as of the first quarter of 2023.Momentum Stocks Billionaires Are Loading Up On10.

One proposal asking Mastercard (MA) to disclose the risks of handling law enforcement requests for abortion-related customer data is scheduled for a vote on June 27.Votes were cast by shareholders of some of the country’s most prominent companies, including Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL), Meta (META), Walmart (WMT), Home Depot (HD), Pfizer (PFE), Abbvie (ABBV), Costco (COST), and Coca-cola (KO).Here's a closer look at those results:Anti-ESGThe lack of support is part of a wider pushback against proposals that demand action on a variety of environmental, social, and governance (ESG) issues ranging from corporate diversity to carbon emissions.In fact, conservative-leaning shareholders have pushed a record number of anti-ESG proposals during recent proxy seasons, a time in the spring and summer when shareholders seek votes on specific proposals.The number of anti-ESG resolutions on corporate ballots between January 1 through May 31 rose by more than 400% from 2020 to 2023, according to ISS Corporate Solutions. That helped drive the volume of shareholder proposals up by 14 percent during that period.Story continuesProtesters outside the Supreme Court in June 2022. (AP Photo/Jacquelyn Martin, File)Activists first gave renewed attention to reproductive rights last year when the Supreme Court overturned the landmark 1973 Roe vs. Wade decision that guaranteed American women the federal constitutional right to an abortion.A leak of the court's draft majority opinion last May triggered some of the first abortion-related proposals. The number of reproductive rights proposals then doubled to roughly 31 between the 2022 and 2023 proxy seasons.'More momentum'One activist investor who encountered pushback from shareholders this year was Arjuna Capital, which was responsible for abortion-related proposals at CVS (CVS), United Parcel Service (UPS), Costco (COST), Meta, and Alphabet.Arjuna argued for the proposals at tech companies like Meta and Alphabet because they are huge arbiters of data. Shareholders for both companies voted down measures that would have required them to assess and minimize how much abortion-related customer data is shared with law enforcement.Shareholders in UPS and Costco similarly voted 'no' to measures that would have required the businesses to report risks caused by state policies restricting reproductive rights, as well as possible mitigation strategies.The latest defeat came on Wednesday when Comcast shareholders decided against a measure asking the telecom giant to regularly disclose its political donations to anti-abortion politicians and organizations that conflict with its publicly stated values.Arjuna Capital managing partner Natasha Lamb. (AP Photo/Steven Senne)Arjuna, however, did succeed in securing new data protection practices at CVS. Negotiations concerning its proposal led the healthcare company to agree to expand privacy protections around consumer health data.“While the proposals have not garnered majority support thus far, the more important outcome is to get companies and investors considering how restricting reproductive freedoms carries inherent business risk,” Arjuna managing partner Natasha Lamb said.ISS said the votes track with an overall drop in enthusiasm for all shareholder proposals in 2023.""When all is said and done, we expect support for shareholder proposals to be down over past years and potentially closer to pre-pandemic norms,” said Jun Frank, managing director at ISS Corporate Solutions.Lamb said she is not giving up.""Unfortunately, the business risks from restricting reproductive freedoms are not going away anytime soon,"" she said, ""and we expect more momentum on this issue heading into the next proxy season.""Alexis Keenan is a legal reporter for Yahoo Finance.

73,a1d88d4b-35d4-3855-abd7-04c2a4f0045c,OXY,2023-06-11,7 Energy Stocks Powering Up for a Rally,InvestorPlace,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/7-energy-stocks-powering-rally-201550027.html,1685909750,STORY,"['NG=F', 'CL=F', 'CVX', 'VLO', 'OXY', 'DVN', 'HAL', 'NEE']","[The market is always forward-looking. That’s one explanation for the drop in energy stocks after a blowout year in 2022. There are some catalysts, however, that point to increased demand. That’s why now is the time to look for energy stocks with growth potential.  To begin with, OPEC appears to be ready to announce its second production cut in 2023. Simple supply and demand suggest that will be bullish for the price of crude oil. In fairness, OPEC cut production for the first time in April when oil was in the $70s. As of this writing, it’s in the $60s, so maybe the second time is the charm. Another catalyst for oil prices may come from the proposed Fiscal Responsibility Act (i.e. the debt ceiling bill). If approved, the bill will expedite the construction of the Mountain Valley Pipeline. It also omits proposals by progressive legislators to fast-track the construction of transmission lines that would accelerate the country’s transition away from fossil fuels. And once again, the market is forward-looking. That means energy stocks likely already factor in a recession late this year. That means now is the time to start looking at the best energy stocks for a rally. Here are 7 options for you to consider.  InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsOXYOccidental Petroleum$59.69CVXChevron$156.26NEENextEra$73.85HALHalliburton$31.64DVNDevon Energy$48.53VLOValero Energy$109.27SLBSchlumberger$46.77Occidental Petroleum (OXY) man's hand holding wads of cash. stocks to buy. Stocks With 1000% UpsideSource: Vova Shevchuk / Shutterstock.comWarren Buffett is credited with the advice for investors to “buy when others are fearful.” No matter how you feel about Warren Buffett, you have to give him credit for practicing what he preaches. Buffett’s hedge fund, Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRK-B) is a major shareholder of Occidental Petroleum (NYSE:OXY).   And so, when OXY stock was trading below $60 in March, Buffett pounced. And the company continued to buy the company’s shares in May. But what makes Occidental a favorite of Buffett? One reason is the company’s recent surge in free cash flow (FCF). The company is pledging to use some of the $1.7 billion in FCF it generated in the first quarter to buy back its shares. And the company also pays a juicy dividend that currently has a yield of 1.23%.  Story continuesOccidental Petroleum also deserves consideration as one of the energy stocks with growth potential because its objectively undervalued. OXY stock trades for a forward price-to-earnings ratio of just over 11x. Analysts give the stock a consensus price target of $68.96 which is a gain of approximately 20% from the stock’s current price.  Chevron (CVX) An image of a street sign post with directions labeled ""Buy"", ""Hold"", and ""Sell""Source: PX Media / ShutterstockAnother energy stock that is a favorite of Warren Buffett is Chevron (NYSE:CVX). It’s true that Buffett has sold some of his CVX stock position recently. And CVX stock tumbled as a result. The stock is down 15% in 2023 alone and down approximately 13% in the last 12 months.  But Buffett’s firm still has a significant position in the stock. That’s unlikely to change because Chevron has the same desirable characteristics as Occidental Petroleum. Specifically, the company has been buying back a significant amount of its own stock. And it pays a healthy dividend which has been increasing for 37 consecutive years. The company’s breakeven oil price is around $50. So even with the price of crude around $68, the company’s balance sheet is in great shape. Plus, the stock is trading for just 10.5x forward earnings.  Skeptics will say it’s foolish to invest in traditional oil stocks at this time. However, those investors are missing the larger plot. Companies like Chevron are already investing in renewable energy projects. In fairness, Chevron is taking a more measured approach, but it has the cash on hand to make a splash when it decides where it can have the most impact. Plus, the company is a major player in the transport of liquefied natural gas, which will remain high in demand as long as Russia’s war with Ukraine is ongoing.  NextEra Energy (NEE) Man holding stacks of money. Top millionaire-maker stocks to buySource: Epic Cure / ShutterstockNextEra Energy (NYSE:NEE) is the next stock on this list of energy stocks with growth potential. The company stands to be one of the largest beneficiaries from the proposed debt ceiling bill. The company contributed significantly to various Congressional leaders in March to attempt to get the Mountain Valley pipeline approved.  This should remind investors that NextEra Energy is a company that relies on fossil fuels and clean energy. All of the company’s clean energy projects are in the United States. This means the company will likely receive tax breaks based on the Inflation Reduction Act passed by Congress in 2022. In that regard, it’s a company that may well reflect the “all of the above” landscape that is likely to be the most productive path for this country’s energy needs. NEE stock is down almost 15% in 2023 and it trades at about 21x earnings. The company’s core business is to provide electricity to a wide geographic area that includes Florida as its largest service area. That gives the company attributes of both a growth stock and a value stock.   Halliburton (HAL) A person draws a stock chart on a chalkboard.Source: Zurijeta / Shutterstock.comHalliburton (NYSE:HAL) is a strong contender to be among the best energy stocks for a rally. To be fair, the oil services company will need to see more drilling in the oil patch. And HAL stock will be heavily affected by crude prices that remain under $70. The reopening of China is not the catalyst that many were expecting. But the need to refill the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, the likelihood of a pause in interest rate hikes, as well as OPEC making an additional production cut will be bullish for oil prices. In turn, HAL stock is likely to benefit.  HAL stock is down 23% in 2023, but at 13x earnings and 9x forward earnings, HAL stock is undervalued. Analysts seem to agree and give the stock a $48 price target. If that’s correct, it would push shares to a seven-year high.  Devon Energy (DVN) hands at desk near laptop computer, with one hand holding a pile of hundred dollar bills. Bank stocksSource: shutterstock.com/CC7Devon Energy (NYSE:DVN) is one of the most attractive stocks on this list of energy stocks with growth potential. The stock is trading near its 52-week low and it has a current P/E ratio of 5x earnings.  The independent oil and gas company delivered its first quarter earnings report in early May. It met expectations on the top line and beat the bottom line. But the key number was its oil production which came in at an all-time high of 320,000 barrels per day.  If as expected oil prices rise, Devon Energy will benefit from higher margins and increased profitability. The company is aggressively buying back its shares and increasing its dividend. These are both signs that management believes DVN stock is undervalued. And apparently so do analysts. The stock has a consensus price target of $63.96 which is a gain of approximately 45% from the stock’s price as of the market close on June 1, 2023.  Valero Energy (VLO) tree growing on coin of stacking with green bokeh background; growth stocksSource: Freedom365day / Shutterstock.comValero Energy (NYSE:VLO) is the largest independent refiner in North America. Since refining oil is needed for the gas we put in our cars, Valero would be a logical pick as one of the top-performing energy stocks. And with VLO stock trading near its 52-week low and at around 3x earnings, it’s one to watch. In addition to refining crude oil into gasoline or diesel fuel, Valero is one of the leading refiners of Ethanol. To date, this represents a small fraction of the company’s overall revenue.  And speaking of revenue, the company had a record revenue year in 2022. And that revenue came with record annual earnings per share of $29.26. In the first quarter of 2023, the company posted earnings per share of $8.27. That was nearly four times the EPS the company delivered in the first quarter of 2022. That’s particularly impressive considering the first quarter is typically the company’s weakest in terms of revenue and EPS. Schlumberger (SLB) Stocks to buy: smartphone with the words ""buy"" and ""sell"" displayed on the screen. The user's finger is about to press buy. Stock charts are in the background of the image.Source: Chompoo Suriyo / Shutterstock.comSchlumberger (NYSE:SLB) is best known to long-time investors as an oil services company that provides the equipment that companies need to drill. The stock’s poor performance over the past five years illustrates how sensitive the company is to oil prices.  Recently, Schlumberger rebranded itself as part of an attempt to make a pivot into carbon capture. The company seems late to the party on this transition. However, it could get a lift from rising oil prices. Manufacturers are spending a significant amount of money to electrify all forms of transportation. That investment alone makes it logical that oil prices will have a ceiling.  That being said, the global recession may be fully priced into oil. What is likely not priced in is the production issues – and elevated price tags – that are putting a ceiling on EV demand. SLB stock is not one to hold for the long term. But if you’re looking for energy stocks with growth potential in 2023 and 2024, it’s a name to watch.  On the date of publication, Chris Markoch had a LONG position in CVX.

According to the latest research, the coffee industry is expected to grow significantly over the next few years, with an estimated global market value of $144.68 billion by 2025.  The rising demand for coffee is mainly due to the changing preferences of consumers, who are increasingly looking for high-quality, ethically sourced, and sustainably produced coffee products. Demographically, the coffee industry caters to a diverse range of consumers, including age, income, education, and lifestyle. Younger consumers prefer specialty coffee drinks like lattes and cappuccinos, while older consumers may prefer traditional drip coffee.  Additionally, consumers in urban areas are more likely to visit coffee shops and cafes, while consumers in rural areas may prefer to brew coffee at home. A recent study reveals that approximately 1 billion coffee enthusiasts worldwide consume a staggering 2 billion cups of coffee daily. However, most of the consumption happens in few countries on an overall basis like the US, but the county's annual per capita consumption is comparitvely low, at just 8 pounds. Speaking of which, some countries that drink the least amount of coffee include Pakistan and Nepal, among others. Surprisingly, over 125 million coffee drinkers reside in the United States, with a significant portion enjoying their morning cup of joe. The study highlights that 90% of older individuals in the US have developed a strong habit of drinking coffee in the morning, while 70% of younger individuals aged 18 to 24 also partake in this caffeinated delight. Consumer behavior analysis is crucial for businesses in the coffee industry to remain competitive and relevant. Understanding consumers' preferences, buying habits, and motivations can help companies develop effective marketing strategies, product offerings, and pricing models. Top 20 Countries With The Highest Coffee ConsumptionPhoto by nathan-dumlao-6VhPY27jdps-unsplashOur Methodology Our methodology for ranking countries with the highest coffee consumption in 2022 involved sorting them in ascending order based on coffee consumed per capita.

The group holding the most number of shares in the company, around 76% to be precise, is institutions. In other words, the group stands to gain the most (or lose the most) from their investment into the company.Since institutional have access to huge amounts of capital, their market moves tend to receive a lot of scrutiny by retail or individual investors. As a result, a sizeable amount of institutional money invested in a firm is generally viewed as a positive attribute.Let's take a closer look to see what the different types of shareholders can tell us about Norfolk Southern. View our latest analysis for Norfolk Southern ownership-breakdownWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Norfolk Southern?Many institutions measure their performance against an index that approximates the local market. So they usually pay more attention to companies that are included in major indices.As you can see, institutional investors have a fair amount of stake in Norfolk Southern. This implies the analysts working for those institutions have looked at the stock and they like it. But just like anyone else, they could be wrong. If multiple institutions change their view on a stock at the same time, you could see the share price drop fast. It's therefore worth looking at Norfolk Southern's earnings history below. Of course, the future is what really matters.earnings-and-revenue-growthInstitutional investors own over 50% of the company, so together than can probably strongly influence board decisions. We note that hedge funds don't have a meaningful investment in Norfolk Southern. The company's largest shareholder is The Vanguard Group, Inc., with ownership of 8.1%. Meanwhile, the second and third largest shareholders, hold 6.8% and 5.1%, of the shares outstanding, respectively.Story continuesA deeper look at our ownership data shows that the top 25 shareholders collectively hold less than half of the register, suggesting a large group of small holders where no single shareholder has a majority.While studying institutional ownership for a company can add value to your research, it is also a good practice to research analyst recommendations to get a deeper understand of a stock's expected performance. Quite a few analysts cover the stock, so you could look into forecast growth quite easily.Insider Ownership Of Norfolk SouthernThe definition of an insider can differ slightly between different countries, but members of the board of directors always count. Management ultimately answers to the board. However, it is not uncommon for managers to be executive board members, especially if they are a founder or the CEO.Insider ownership is positive when it signals leadership are thinking like the true owners of the company. However, high insider ownership can also give immense power to a small group within the company. This can be negative in some circumstances.Our most recent data indicates that insiders own less than 1% of Norfolk Southern Corporation. As it is a large company, we'd only expect insiders to own a small percentage of it. But it's worth noting that they own US$64m worth of shares. It is good to see board members owning shares, but it might be worth checking if those insiders have been buying. General Public OwnershipThe general public-- including retail investors -- own 24% stake in the company, and hence can't easily be ignored. While this group can't necessarily call the shots, it can certainly have a real influence on how the company is run.Next Steps:I find it very interesting to look at who exactly owns a company.

If you want to skip our detailed analysis of the water industry and consumption trends, go directly to the Top 5 Countries with Highest Water Consumption.According to the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) of the United Nations (UN), the global population is expected to reach around 9 to 10 billion by the middle of this century. With such a growing population, ensuring food security becomes a critical challenge. Agriculture is the largest consumer of water as the sector is responsible for consuming around 75% to 90% of total global freshwater. In countries like India, Iran, Pakistan, Thailand, and Vietnam, over 90% of freshwater consumption is for agricultural purposes. Overall, the use of water for agricultural purposes stands at an average of 41% for high-income nations, 79% for middle-income countries, and 90% for low-income countriesThe global water industry plays a crucial role in providing essential services to communities, industries, and agricultural sectors worldwide. Globally, 17% of the total water consumption is for industrial purposes. As opposed to the high use of water for agricultural purposes by low-income countries, the use of water for industrial purposes is primarily dominated by high-income countries. Overall, the United States (US) uses 300 billion cubic meters (m3) of water for industrial purposes annually. This makes it the biggest consumer of water for industrial purposes. China is the second biggest user, as it consumes 140 billion m3 of water for industrial purposes. Japan and Mexico are also among the top 10 countries with highest water consumption. According to Allied Market Research, the size of the global process water treatment market is expected to rise from $263.1 billion in 2020 to $520.4 billion by 2030. This would reflect a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 7.0%. Process water is utilized in various manufacturing processes such as cooling tower make-up water and coating and plating. The process water treatment market is anticipated to grow during the forecast period due to the rising demand for clean water in the industrial sector and strict regulations regarding wastewater discharge.Story continuesThe patterns of water consumption by country per capita vary across regions due to multiple factors. Presently, the total annual global water consumption stands at around 4 trillion m3. Out of this, the members of the Organization of the Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) are responsible for consuming 20% to 25% of the global freshwater. Meanwhile, Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa (BRICS) countries consume a share of nearly 45%. While it might be assumed that the most common use of water is for domestic purposes, only 11% of the global water is actually used for municipal or domestic purposes. According to the water usage statistics by Our World in Data, China is the biggest consumer of water for domestic purposes like cleaning, cooking, drinking, and washing and uses over 70 billion m3 annually. Meanwhile, the US is the second biggest consumer of water in the world for domestic purposes and one of the countries that use the most water per person per day. According to Fortune Business Insights, North America holds the largest market share of the global drinking water market. As per data provided by the Beverage Marketing Corporation (BMC), the total volume of bottled water recorded an increase of 0.6 billion gallons of water between 2014 and 2019, reflecting a growth of around 4%. The key players in the global drinking water market include The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO), PepsiCo, Inc. (NASDAQ:PEP), and Nestlé S.A. (OTC:NSRGY).Countries with Highest Water ConsumptionPhoto by Adam Navarro on UnsplashOur MethodologyTo shortlist the countries with highest water consumption, we obtained the annual water consumption data from AQUASTAT, which is the global information system on water resources and agricultural water management for the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO). The figures obtained include the total water withdrawals by the agricultural, domestic and industrial sectors for each country as of 2020. The countries have been ranked in ascending order of their annual water consumption. These 20 countries are responsible for nearly 80% of the global water consumption.Top 20 Countries with Highest Water Consumption20.

82,be97e503-5287-3ad0-b33b-c2141800bf31,KO,2023-06-11,Coca-Cola Consolidated's (NASDAQ:COKE) earnings growth rate lags the 38% CAGR delivered to shareholders,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/coca-cola-consolidateds-nasdaq-coke-143109340.html,1686407469,STORY,"['KO', 'COKE']","[For many, the main point of investing in the stock market is to achieve spectacular returns. And highest quality companies can see their share prices grow by huge amounts. Don't believe it? Then look at the Coca-Cola Consolidated, Inc. (NASDAQ:COKE) share price. It's 396% higher than it was five years ago. And this is just one example of the epic gains achieved by some long term investors. On top of that, the share price is up 27% in about a quarter.In light of the stock dropping 3.8% in the past week, we want to investigate the longer term story, and see if fundamentals have been the driver of the company's positive five-year return. View our latest analysis for Coca-Cola Consolidated While the efficient markets hypothesis continues to be taught by some, it has been proven that markets are over-reactive dynamic systems, and investors are not always rational. One way to examine how market sentiment has changed over time is to look at the interaction between a company's share price and its earnings per share (EPS).During five years of share price growth, Coca-Cola Consolidated achieved compound earnings per share (EPS) growth of 39% per year. This EPS growth is remarkably close to the 38% average annual increase in the share price. Therefore one could conclude that sentiment towards the shares hasn't morphed very much. Rather, the share price has approximately tracked EPS growth.The image below shows how EPS has tracked over time (if you click on the image you can see greater detail).earnings-per-share-growthDive deeper into Coca-Cola Consolidated's key metrics by checking this interactive graph of Coca-Cola Consolidated's earnings, revenue and cash flow.What About Dividends?It is important to consider the total shareholder return, as well as the share price return, for any given stock. The TSR incorporates the value of any spin-offs or discounted capital raisings, along with any dividends, based on the assumption that the dividends are reinvested. Arguably, the TSR gives a more comprehensive picture of the return generated by a stock. In the case of Coca-Cola Consolidated, it has a TSR of 409% for the last 5 years. That exceeds its share price return that we previously mentioned. And there's no prize for guessing that the dividend payments largely explain the divergence!Story continuesA Different PerspectiveIt's nice to see that Coca-Cola Consolidated shareholders have received a total shareholder return of 15% over the last year. Of course, that includes the dividend. However, that falls short of the 38% TSR per annum it has made for shareholders, each year, over five years. Potential buyers might understandably feel they've missed the opportunity, but it's always possible business is still firing on all cylinders. Is Coca-Cola Consolidated cheap compared to other companies? These 3 valuation measures might help you decide.We will like Coca-Cola Consolidated better if we see some big insider buys.

83,e4a782aa-589b-31f9-af6a-f28054ee5be2,KO,2023-06-11,Interested In Coca-Cola's (NYSE:KO) Upcoming US$0.46 Dividend? You Have Four Days Left,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/interested-coca-colas-nyse-ko-121906251.html,1686399546,STORY,['KO'],"[Some investors rely on dividends for growing their wealth, and if you're one of those dividend sleuths, you might be intrigued to know that The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) is about to go ex-dividend in just four days. The ex-dividend date is one business day before a company's record date, which is the date on which the company determines which shareholders are entitled to receive a dividend. The ex-dividend date is important as the process of settlement involves two full business days. So if you miss that date, you would not show up on the company's books on the record date. In other words, investors can purchase Coca-Cola's shares before the 15th of June in order to be eligible for the dividend, which will be paid on the 3rd of July.The company's upcoming dividend is US$0.46 a share, following on from the last 12 months, when the company distributed a total of US$1.84 per share to shareholders. Calculating the last year's worth of payments shows that Coca-Cola has a trailing yield of 3.0% on the current share price of $60.47. If you buy this business for its dividend, you should have an idea of whether Coca-Cola's dividend is reliable and sustainable. We need to see whether the dividend is covered by earnings and if it's growing. See our latest analysis for Coca-Cola If a company pays out more in dividends than it earned, then the dividend might become unsustainable - hardly an ideal situation. It paid out 78% of its earnings as dividends last year, which is not unreasonable, but limits reinvestment in the business and leaves the dividend vulnerable to a business downturn. We'd be concerned if earnings began to decline. That said, even highly profitable companies sometimes might not generate enough cash to pay the dividend, which is why we should always check if the dividend is covered by cash flow. It paid out more than half (64%) of its free cash flow in the past year, which is within an average range for most companies.Story continuesIt's positive to see that Coca-Cola's dividend is covered by both profits and cash flow, since this is generally a sign that the dividend is sustainable, and a lower payout ratio usually suggests a greater margin of safety before the dividend gets cut.Click here to see the company's payout ratio, plus analyst estimates of its future dividends.historic-dividendHave Earnings And Dividends Been Growing?Stocks in companies that generate sustainable earnings growth often make the best dividend prospects, as it is easier to lift the dividend when earnings are rising. If earnings decline and the company is forced to cut its dividend, investors could watch the value of their investment go up in smoke. It's encouraging to see Coca-Cola has grown its earnings rapidly, up 51% a year for the past five years. The company is paying out more than three-quarters of its earnings, but it is also generating strong earnings growth.The main way most investors will assess a company's dividend prospects is by checking the historical rate of dividend growth. Coca-Cola has delivered an average of 6.1% per year annual increase in its dividend, based on the past 10 years of dividend payments. We're glad to see dividends rising alongside earnings over a number of years, which may be a sign the company intends to share the growth with shareholders.To Sum It UpFrom a dividend perspective, should investors buy or avoid Coca-Cola? It's good to see earnings are growing, since all of the best dividend stocks grow their earnings meaningfully over the long run. That's why we're glad to see Coca-Cola's earnings per share growing, although as we saw, the company is paying out more than half of its earnings and cashflow - 78% and 64% respectively. Overall, it's hard to get excited about Coca-Cola from a dividend perspective.In light of that, while Coca-Cola has an appealing dividend, it's worth knowing the risks involved with this stock. Our analysis shows 2 warning signs for Coca-Cola and you should be aware of them before buying any shares.A common investing mistake is buying the first interesting stock you see.

However, now the landscape looks significantly different. This is marked by a substantial dip in oil prices that slipped below $75 per barrel and a steep decline in natural gas prices.Nonetheless, the prospect of high return energy stocks is far from bleak. Indeed, the recent shock production cuts by the OPEC and non-member oil-producing nations underscore this belief. These production cuts amounting to 3.66 million barrels per day, showcase a symbolic shift in the worldwide power dynamic. Such an unexpected twist could be the catalyst needed for the best undervalued energy stocks for June to emerge from their indolence. Hence, it’s the right time to bet on these three energy stocks to buy in June.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsValero Energy (VLO)A daytime picture of a Valero (VLO) gas station located in San Francisco bay and clear blue sky in the background.Source: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.comValero Energy (NYSE:VLO) shines in the refining space with 15 cutting-edge locations, propelling it to the forefront as the most cost-efficient player in the market.

Though the current economic uncertainty has resulted in investor uneasiness, PBF’s financial management has been exemplary.In the past year, expanding crack spreads have increased profitability for refiners. PBF Energy has taken advantage of this situation to pare down its debt effectively. Its total liabilities substantially dropped from $10.4 billion in March 2022 to $7.87 billion by March 2023.In its commitment to return capital to shareholders, the company declared a 20 cents per share per quarter dividend. Notably, PBF has effectively executed $500 million in stock buybacks, increasing the authorized amount for buybacks to $1 billion. Meanwhile, during the first quarter, the firm’s operations further supported gross debt reductions of $525 million. The stock trades at just 0.12 times forward sales estimates, 89% lower than the sector median.Magnolia Oil &amp; Gas (MGY)In the field, the oil pump in the evening, the evening silhouette of the pumping unit, the silhouette of the oil pump.

That’s one explanation for the drop in energy stocks after a blowout year in 2022. There are some catalysts, however, that point to increased demand. That’s why now is the time to look for energy stocks with growth potential.  To begin with, OPEC appears to be ready to announce its second production cut in 2023. Simple supply and demand suggest that will be bullish for the price of crude oil. In fairness, OPEC cut production for the first time in April when oil was in the $70s. As of this writing, it’s in the $60s, so maybe the second time is the charm. Another catalyst for oil prices may come from the proposed Fiscal Responsibility Act (i.e. the debt ceiling bill). If approved, the bill will expedite the construction of the Mountain Valley Pipeline. It also omits proposals by progressive legislators to fast-track the construction of transmission lines that would accelerate the country’s transition away from fossil fuels. And once again, the market is forward-looking. That means energy stocks likely already factor in a recession late this year. That means now is the time to start looking at the best energy stocks for a rally. Here are 7 options for you to consider.  InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsOXYOccidental Petroleum$59.69CVXChevron$156.26NEENextEra$73.85HALHalliburton$31.64DVNDevon Energy$48.53VLOValero Energy$109.27SLBSchlumberger$46.77Occidental Petroleum (OXY) man's hand holding wads of cash. stocks to buy. Stocks With 1000% UpsideSource: Vova Shevchuk / Shutterstock.comWarren Buffett is credited with the advice for investors to “buy when others are fearful.” No matter how you feel about Warren Buffett, you have to give him credit for practicing what he preaches. Buffett’s hedge fund, Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRK-B) is a major shareholder of Occidental Petroleum (NYSE:OXY).   And so, when OXY stock was trading below $60 in March, Buffett pounced. And the company continued to buy the company’s shares in May. But what makes Occidental a favorite of Buffett? One reason is the company’s recent surge in free cash flow (FCF). The company is pledging to use some of the $1.7 billion in FCF it generated in the first quarter to buy back its shares. And the company also pays a juicy dividend that currently has a yield of 1.23%.  Story continuesOccidental Petroleum also deserves consideration as one of the energy stocks with growth potential because its objectively undervalued. OXY stock trades for a forward price-to-earnings ratio of just over 11x. Analysts give the stock a consensus price target of $68.96 which is a gain of approximately 20% from the stock’s current price.  Chevron (CVX) An image of a street sign post with directions labeled ""Buy"", ""Hold"", and ""Sell""Source: PX Media / ShutterstockAnother energy stock that is a favorite of Warren Buffett is Chevron (NYSE:CVX). It’s true that Buffett has sold some of his CVX stock position recently. And CVX stock tumbled as a result. The stock is down 15% in 2023 alone and down approximately 13% in the last 12 months.  But Buffett’s firm still has a significant position in the stock. That’s unlikely to change because Chevron has the same desirable characteristics as Occidental Petroleum. Specifically, the company has been buying back a significant amount of its own stock. And it pays a healthy dividend which has been increasing for 37 consecutive years. The company’s breakeven oil price is around $50. So even with the price of crude around $68, the company’s balance sheet is in great shape. Plus, the stock is trading for just 10.5x forward earnings.  Skeptics will say it’s foolish to invest in traditional oil stocks at this time. However, those investors are missing the larger plot. Companies like Chevron are already investing in renewable energy projects. In fairness, Chevron is taking a more measured approach, but it has the cash on hand to make a splash when it decides where it can have the most impact. Plus, the company is a major player in the transport of liquefied natural gas, which will remain high in demand as long as Russia’s war with Ukraine is ongoing.  NextEra Energy (NEE) Man holding stacks of money. Top millionaire-maker stocks to buySource: Epic Cure / ShutterstockNextEra Energy (NYSE:NEE) is the next stock on this list of energy stocks with growth potential. The company stands to be one of the largest beneficiaries from the proposed debt ceiling bill. The company contributed significantly to various Congressional leaders in March to attempt to get the Mountain Valley pipeline approved.  This should remind investors that NextEra Energy is a company that relies on fossil fuels and clean energy. All of the company’s clean energy projects are in the United States. This means the company will likely receive tax breaks based on the Inflation Reduction Act passed by Congress in 2022. In that regard, it’s a company that may well reflect the “all of the above” landscape that is likely to be the most productive path for this country’s energy needs. NEE stock is down almost 15% in 2023 and it trades at about 21x earnings. The company’s core business is to provide electricity to a wide geographic area that includes Florida as its largest service area. That gives the company attributes of both a growth stock and a value stock.   Halliburton (HAL) A person draws a stock chart on a chalkboard.Source: Zurijeta / Shutterstock.comHalliburton (NYSE:HAL) is a strong contender to be among the best energy stocks for a rally. To be fair, the oil services company will need to see more drilling in the oil patch. And HAL stock will be heavily affected by crude prices that remain under $70. The reopening of China is not the catalyst that many were expecting. But the need to refill the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, the likelihood of a pause in interest rate hikes, as well as OPEC making an additional production cut will be bullish for oil prices. In turn, HAL stock is likely to benefit.  HAL stock is down 23% in 2023, but at 13x earnings and 9x forward earnings, HAL stock is undervalued. Analysts seem to agree and give the stock a $48 price target. If that’s correct, it would push shares to a seven-year high.  Devon Energy (DVN) hands at desk near laptop computer, with one hand holding a pile of hundred dollar bills. Bank stocksSource: shutterstock.com/CC7Devon Energy (NYSE:DVN) is one of the most attractive stocks on this list of energy stocks with growth potential. The stock is trading near its 52-week low and it has a current P/E ratio of 5x earnings.  The independent oil and gas company delivered its first quarter earnings report in early May. It met expectations on the top line and beat the bottom line. But the key number was its oil production which came in at an all-time high of 320,000 barrels per day.  If as expected oil prices rise, Devon Energy will benefit from higher margins and increased profitability. The company is aggressively buying back its shares and increasing its dividend. These are both signs that management believes DVN stock is undervalued. And apparently so do analysts. The stock has a consensus price target of $63.96 which is a gain of approximately 45% from the stock’s price as of the market close on June 1, 2023.  Valero Energy (VLO) tree growing on coin of stacking with green bokeh background; growth stocksSource: Freedom365day / Shutterstock.comValero Energy (NYSE:VLO) is the largest independent refiner in North America. Since refining oil is needed for the gas we put in our cars, Valero would be a logical pick as one of the top-performing energy stocks. And with VLO stock trading near its 52-week low and at around 3x earnings, it’s one to watch. In addition to refining crude oil into gasoline or diesel fuel, Valero is one of the leading refiners of Ethanol. To date, this represents a small fraction of the company’s overall revenue.  And speaking of revenue, the company had a record revenue year in 2022. And that revenue came with record annual earnings per share of $29.26. In the first quarter of 2023, the company posted earnings per share of $8.27. That was nearly four times the EPS the company delivered in the first quarter of 2022. That’s particularly impressive considering the first quarter is typically the company’s weakest in terms of revenue and EPS. Schlumberger (SLB) Stocks to buy: smartphone with the words ""buy"" and ""sell"" displayed on the screen. The user's finger is about to press buy. Stock charts are in the background of the image.Source: Chompoo Suriyo / Shutterstock.comSchlumberger (NYSE:SLB) is best known to long-time investors as an oil services company that provides the equipment that companies need to drill. The stock’s poor performance over the past five years illustrates how sensitive the company is to oil prices.  Recently, Schlumberger rebranded itself as part of an attempt to make a pivot into carbon capture. The company seems late to the party on this transition. However, it could get a lift from rising oil prices. Manufacturers are spending a significant amount of money to electrify all forms of transportation. That investment alone makes it logical that oil prices will have a ceiling.  That being said, the global recession may be fully priced into oil. What is likely not priced in is the production issues – and elevated price tags – that are putting a ceiling on EV demand. SLB stock is not one to hold for the long term. But if you’re looking for energy stocks with growth potential in 2023 and 2024, it’s a name to watch.  On the date of publication, Chris Markoch had a LONG position in CVX.

This makes the dividend yield about the same as the industry average at 1.3%. See our latest analysis for UnitedHealth Group UnitedHealth Group's Earnings Easily Cover The DistributionsSolid dividend yields are great, but they only really help us if the payment is sustainable. However, prior to this announcement, UnitedHealth Group's dividend was comfortably covered by both cash flow and earnings. This means that most of its earnings are being retained to grow the business.The next year is set to see EPS grow by 43.1%. If the dividend continues on this path, the payout ratio could be 25% by next year, which we think can be pretty sustainable going forward.historic-dividendUnitedHealth Group Has A Solid Track RecordThe company has been paying a dividend for a long time, and it has been quite stable which gives us confidence in the future dividend potential. Since 2013, the annual payment back then was $0.85, compared to the most recent full-year payment of $6.60. This implies that the company grew its distributions at a yearly rate of about 23% over that duration. We can see that payments have shown some very nice upward momentum without faltering, which provides some reassurance that future payments will also be reliable.The Dividend Looks Likely To GrowInvestors could be attracted to the stock based on the quality of its payment history. We are encouraged to see that UnitedHealth Group has grown earnings per share at 14% per year over the past five years. UnitedHealth Group definitely has the potential to grow its dividend in the future with earnings on an uptrend and a low payout ratio.UnitedHealth Group Looks Like A Great Dividend StockOverall, a dividend increase is always good, and we think that UnitedHealth Group is a strong income stock thanks to its track record and growing earnings. Distributions are quite easily covered by earnings, which are also being converted to cash flows. All of these factors considered, we think this has solid potential as a dividend stock.Story continuesCompanies possessing a stable dividend policy will likely enjoy greater investor interest than those suffering from a more inconsistent approach. Still, investors need to consider a host of other factors, apart from dividend payments, when analysing a company.

Unfortunately, there are still plenty of REITs to sell before they drop even further. Although interest rates may not necessarily be on track to spike as sharply as they have over the past 18 months, worsening economic conditions may place more pressure on the sector.As you’ve likely seen, there is plenty of chatter about a possible “commercial real estate crisis,” particularly with office properties. Demand for office space dipped during the pandemic and the move to hybrid/remote workplaces, but didn’t recover post-pandemic. More recently, the economic downturn has further dampened office space demand.However, don’t assume it’s only office building REITs you need to steer clear of. There are plenty of lower-rated REITs to avoid owning other types of properties.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsSo, what are some of the REITs to sell before they drop? Avoid these seven, as numerous challenges weigh on the real estate sector.Blackstone Mortgage Trust (BXMT)Grayish photo of investor's hands hovering over laptop with red stock graph showing downward arrow overlayed on top of the imageSource: shutterstock.com/Leonid SorokinBlackstone Mortgage Trust (NYSE:BXMT) is a mortgage REIT focused on investing in commercial mortgage loans. As I discussed last month, BXMT, along with a similar commercial mortgage REIT, Starwood Property Trust (NYSE:STWD), have become heavily shorted.According to Bloomberg, short-sellers have upped their bearish bets against BXMT stock and STWD stock. Although both REITs hold portfolios of floating rate commercial mortgage securities (i.e. they benefit from rising interest rates), the short side believes this is one of the REITs expected to crumble under pressure, as landlord defaults lead to higher-than-expected loan losses.Sure, this rising short interest has already pushed BXMT more than 40% lower in the past year. Many commentators now argue that potential loan losses are now largely priced-in. However, given the high uncertainty with commercial real estate, it may be wise to err on the side of caution and stay away.Story continuesDigital Realty Trust (DLR)Figurines of two little men in suits looking at downward stock arrow going through the floorSource: shutterstock.com/Black SalmonSince late May, Digital Realty Trust (NYSE:DLR) has bolted higher, as investors flock back to the REIT. All because DLR owns hundreds of data center properties across the United States and around the world. Chalk it up to the artificial intelligence (or AI) megatrend. “AI mania” has speculators betting that increased adoption of AI will boost demand for DLR’s properties, enabling this REIT to thrive despite the challenging macro environment.However, not everyone holds this optimistic view. In fact, analysts at Hedgeye are pitching Digital Realty Trust as a short idea. Believing that DLR overpaid for many of its assets is much more capital-intensive compared to other REITs, and has an unsustainable rate of payout, the research firm argues that it is one of the REITs to sell before they drop, as a dividend cut may be inevitable.Global Net Lease (GNL)Death: grim reaper in black cloakSource: ShutterstockGlobal Net Lease (NYSE:GNL) has been one of the underperforming REITs to sell for quite some time. Still, many have been tempted to buy this REIT, which focuses on properties acquired through sale-leaseback transactions.A big reason for this is the high forward yield of GNL stock. At current prices, this yield comes in at around 16.6%. However, it is very questionable whether GNL’s high payout is sustainable. Yes, Global Net Lease’s plans to merge with Necessity Retail REIT (NASDAQ:RTL) are expected to result in cost savings that will fall straight to the bottom line.Even so, as I have pointed out previously, GNL’s funds from operations (or FFO) have been declining for several years. Declines could intensify if the real estate downturn continues. This could counter cost savings from this merger, leaving Global Net Lease still at risk of a dividend cut.Hudson Pacific Properties (HPP)A white clock indicates it's time to sell.Source: ShutterstockOne could call Hudson Pacific Properties (NYSE:HPP) a hybrid REIT. Alongside ownership of many office buildings in the Los Angeles and San Francisco metro areas, HPP owns several Hollywood film and TV production facilities, including the famed Sunset Bronson studios facility.That said, this diversification isn’t doing much to help HPP stock. Work-from-home trends are affecting HPP’s office portfolio, and now the Writer’s Guild Strike (which has halted film/TV production) is now set to hurt the performance of its studio portfolio.Down by more than 76.5% in the past year, it may seem like all of these issues are priced-in. Then again, maybe not. As a Seeking Alpha commentator argued recently, bankruptcy risk remains high, even after this REIT slashed its dividend. With all these challenges in mind, consider HPP one of the REITs to sell before they drop yet again.Paramount Group (PGRE)little girl holding a stock chart with athumbs down. stocks to avoidSource: ShutterstockParamount Group (NYSE:PGRE) owns a portfolio of Class A office buildings in New York and San Francisco. However, while its properties are high-quality, this is one of the lower-rated REITs to avoid. Why?PGRE stock has tumbled from over $15 per share pre-pandemic to around $4.25 per share today. Much of these declines have been fueled by the work-from-home trend, which has severely affected demand in both of Paramount’s key markets. However, PGRE has experienced some other major issues.As InvestorPlace’s Ian Bezek pointed out in May, the now-failed First Republic Bank (OTCMKTS:FRCB) was PGRE’s largest tenant. If office space demand remains weak, challenges could continue for Paramount. This REIT has leases covering millions of square footage that expire over the next few years. Even after falling into penny stock territory this year, further declines may be in store for PGRE shares.Sabra Health Care REIT (SBRA)a frustrated man with a white board behind him that features a black downward arrowSource: ShutterstockSabra Health Care REIT (NASDAQ:SBRA) owns a portfolio of skilled nursing facilities, senior housing communities, and other healthcare-related properties. With a double-digit dividend yield (10.76%), SBRA may look tempting to income-focused REIT investors.However, SBRA stock is high-yield for a reason. Like other REITs operating in the skilled nursing/senior housing space, revenue and earnings dropped during the pandemic, and have yet to fully recover. While credit rating agencies like Fitch believe things are stabilizing at Sabra, further deterioration may not be out of the question.SBRA hasn’t slashed its dividend since 2020, but it would likely need to slash its rate of payout again, if its operating performance worsens from here. With Sabra’s high yield its main appeal, any dividend reduction/suspension is likely to have a severe impact on the stock price. This makes SBRA one of the REITs to sell before they drop.SL Green Realty (SLG)earningsSource: ShutterstockLike PGRE, SL Green Realty (NYSE:SLG) is an office REIT with high New York City exposure. In fact, all of SL Green’s properties are located in the midtown and financial districts of Manhattan.As InvestorPlace’s Alex Siriois argued last month, the failure of “return to office” initiatives has been bad news for this REIT, and for SLG stock. Rental income has declined, all while interest expense has nearly tripled. Average rents are trending lower, and SLG’s vacancy rate is trending higher.These issues have already weighed on the performance of SLG. Shares have fallen by around a third since January alone, and have tumbled more than 60% over the past twelve months. The situation could get worse, as loan maturities loom. SLG will likely need to refinance much of its debt at higher rates, which as I’ve pointed out previously, could threaten SLG’s super-large dividend (14.4% forward yield).BXMTBlackstone Mortgage Trust$19.01DLRDigital Realty Trust$105.30GNLGlobal Net Lease$10.04HPPHudson Pacific Properties$4.97PGREParamount Group$4.51SBRASabra Health Care REIT$11.35SLGSL Green Realty$23.77On the date of publication, Thomas Niel did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.Thomas Niel, contributor for InvestorPlace.com, has been writing single-stock analysis for web-based publications since 2016.More From InvestorPlaceBuy This $5 Stock BEFORE This Apple Project Goes LiveWall Street Titan: Here’s My #1 Stock for 2023The $1 Investment You MUST Take Advantage of Right NowIt doesn’t matter if you have $500 or $5 million.

Buying under-rated businesses is one path to excess returns. For example, long term The Sherwin-Williams Company (NYSE:SHW) shareholders have enjoyed a 80% share price rise over the last half decade, well in excess of the market return of around 46% (not including dividends).So let's assess the underlying fundamentals over the last 5 years and see if they've moved in lock-step with shareholder returns. See our latest analysis for Sherwin-Williams In his essay The Superinvestors of Graham-and-Doddsville Warren Buffett described how share prices do not always rationally reflect the value of a business. By comparing earnings per share (EPS) and share price changes over time, we can get a feel for how investor attitudes to a company have morphed over time.Over half a decade, Sherwin-Williams managed to grow its earnings per share at 5.3% a year. This EPS growth is lower than the 12% average annual increase in the share price. This suggests that market participants hold the company in higher regard, these days. That's not necessarily surprising considering the five-year track record of earnings growth.You can see how EPS has changed over time in the image below (click on the chart to see the exact values).earnings-per-share-growthWe consider it positive that insiders have made significant purchases in the last year. Having said that, most people consider earnings and revenue growth trends to be a more meaningful guide to the business. It might be well worthwhile taking a look at our free report on Sherwin-Williams' earnings, revenue and cash flow.What About Dividends?It is important to consider the total shareholder return, as well as the share price return, for any given stock. Whereas the share price return only reflects the change in the share price, the TSR includes the value of dividends (assuming they were reinvested) and the benefit of any discounted capital raising or spin-off. Arguably, the TSR gives a more comprehensive picture of the return generated by a stock. In the case of Sherwin-Williams, it has a TSR of 88% for the last 5 years. That exceeds its share price return that we previously mentioned. And there's no prize for guessing that the dividend payments largely explain the divergence!Story continuesA Different PerspectiveWhile the broader market gained around 10% in the last year, Sherwin-Williams shareholders lost 1.7% (even including dividends). Even the share prices of good stocks drop sometimes, but we want to see improvements in the fundamental metrics of a business, before getting too interested. Longer term investors wouldn't be so upset, since they would have made 13%, each year, over five years. It could be that the recent sell-off is an opportunity, so it may be worth checking the fundamental data for signs of a long term growth trend. I find it very interesting to look at share price over the long term as a proxy for business performance. But to truly gain insight, we need to consider other information, too. Consider for instance, the ever-present spectre of investment risk.

(NASDAQ:REGN) Shares Could Be 29% Below Their Intrinsic Value Estimate",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/regeneron-pharmaceuticals-inc-nasdaq-regn-120017288.html,1686484817,STORY,['REGN'],"[Key InsightsThe projected fair value for Regeneron Pharmaceuticals is US$1,045 based on 2 Stage Free Cash Flow to EquityRegeneron Pharmaceuticals' US$747 share price signals that it might be 29% undervaluedOur fair value estimate is 18% higher than Regeneron Pharmaceuticals' analyst price target of US$882Today we will run through one way of estimating the intrinsic value of Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (NASDAQ:REGN) by taking the expected future cash flows and discounting them to their present value. Our analysis will employ the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model. Before you think you won't be able to understand it, just read on! It's actually much less complex than you'd imagine.We would caution that there are many ways of valuing a company and, like the DCF, each technique has advantages and disadvantages in certain scenarios. If you still have some burning questions about this type of valuation, take a look at the Simply Wall St analysis model. See our latest analysis for Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Crunching The NumbersWe use what is known as a 2-stage model, which simply means we have two different periods of growth rates for the company's cash flows. Generally the first stage is higher growth, and the second stage is a lower growth phase. In the first stage we need to estimate the cash flows to the business over the next ten years. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.Generally we assume that a dollar today is more valuable than a dollar in the future, so we discount the value of these future cash flows to their estimated value in today's dollars:Story continues10-year free cash flow (FCF) forecast2023202420252026202720282029203020312032 Levered FCF ($, Millions) US$4.70bUS$4.20bUS$4.47bUS$4.84bUS$5.38bUS$5.73bUS$6.02bUS$6.28bUS$6.50bUS$6.71bGrowth Rate Estimate SourceAnalyst x5Analyst x5Analyst x5Analyst x3Analyst x3Est @ 6.45%Est @ 5.15%Est @ 4.24%Est @ 3.60%Est @ 3.15% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 6.9% US$4.4kUS$3.7kUS$3.7kUS$3.7kUS$3.9kUS$3.8kUS$3.8kUS$3.7kUS$3.6kUS$3.5k(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$38bWe now need to calculate the Terminal Value, which accounts for all the future cash flows after this ten year period. For a number of reasons a very conservative growth rate is used that cannot exceed that of a country's GDP growth. In this case we have used the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield (2.1%) to estimate future growth. In the same way as with the 10-year 'growth' period, we discount future cash flows to today's value, using a cost of equity of 6.9%.Terminal Value (TV)= FCF2032 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$6.7b× (1 + 2.1%) ÷ (6.9%– 2.1%) = US$144bPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$144b÷ ( 1 + 6.9%)10= US$74bThe total value is the sum of cash flows for the next ten years plus the discounted terminal value, which results in the Total Equity Value, which in this case is US$112b. To get the intrinsic value per share, we divide this by the total number of shares outstanding. Relative to the current share price of US$747, the company appears a touch undervalued at a 29% discount to where the stock price trades currently. The assumptions in any calculation have a big impact on the valuation, so it is better to view this as a rough estimate, not precise down to the last cent.dcfThe AssumptionsWe would point out that the most important inputs to a discounted cash flow are the discount rate and of course the actual cash flows. You don't have to agree with these inputs, I recommend redoing the calculations yourself and playing with them. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Regeneron Pharmaceuticals as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 6.9%, which is based on a levered beta of 0.800. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.SWOT Analysis for Regeneron PharmaceuticalsStrengthDebt is not viewed as a risk.WeaknessEarnings declined over the past year.OpportunityAnnual earnings are forecast to grow for the next 3 years.Trading below our estimate of fair value by more than 20%.ThreatAnnual earnings are forecast to grow slower than the American market.Moving On:Valuation is only one side of the coin in terms of building your investment thesis, and it ideally won't be the sole piece of analysis you scrutinize for a company. DCF models are not the be-all and end-all of investment valuation. Instead the best use for a DCF model is to test certain assumptions and theories to see if they would lead to the company being undervalued or overvalued. For example, changes in the company's cost of equity or the risk free rate can significantly impact the valuation. What is the reason for the share price sitting below the intrinsic value?
