But if you pay close attention, you might gather that its strong financials could mean that the stock could potentially see an increase in value in the long-term, given how markets usually reward companies with good financial health. Particularly, we will be paying attention to Range Resources'  ROE today."", 'Return on Equity or ROE is a test of how effectively a company is growing its value and managing investors’ money. In short, ROE shows the profit each dollar generates with respect to its shareholder investments.', ' See our latest analysis for Range Resources ', 'The formula for ROE is:', ""Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' Equity"", 'So, based on the above formula, the ROE for Range Resources is:', '40% = US$1.4b ÷ US$3.4b (Based on the trailing twelve months to September 2023).', ""The 'return' is the profit over the last twelve months. One way to conceptualize this is that for each $1 of shareholders' capital it has, the company made $0.40 in profit."", 'So far, we\'ve learned that ROE is a measure of a company\'s profitability. Based on how much of its profits the company chooses to reinvest or ""retain"", we are then able to evaluate a company\'s future ability to generate profits. Generally speaking, other things being equal, firms with a high return on equity and profit retention, have a higher growth rate than firms that don’t share these attributes.', ""To begin with, Range Resources has a pretty high ROE which is interesting. Additionally, the company's ROE is higher compared to the industry average of 23% which is quite remarkable. As a result, Range Resources' exceptional 58% net income growth seen over the past five years, doesn't come as a surprise."", ""We then compared Range Resources' net income growth with the industry and we're pleased to see that the company's growth figure is higher when compared with the industry which has a growth rate of 34% in the same 5-year period."", 'The basis for attaching value to a company is, to a great extent, tied to its earnings growth. What investors need to determine next is if the expected earnings growth, or the lack of it, is already built into the share price. This then helps them determine if the stock is placed for a bright or bleak future. One good indicator of expected earnings growth is the P/E ratio which determines the price the market is willing to pay for a stock based on its earnings prospects. So, you may want to check if Range Resources is trading on a high P/E or a low P/E, relative to its industry.', ""Range Resources' three-year median payout ratio to shareholders is 3.1%, which is quite low. This implies that the company is retaining 97% of its profits. So it seems like the management is reinvesting profits heavily to grow its business and this reflects in its earnings growth number."", ""Besides, Range Resources has been paying dividends for at least ten years or more. This shows that the company is committed to sharing profits with its shareholders. Our latest analyst data shows that the future payout ratio of the company is expected to rise to 10% over the next three years. Therefore, the expected rise in the payout ratio explains why the company's ROE is expected to decline to 12% over the same period."", ""Overall, we are quite pleased with Range Resources' performance. Specifically, we like that the company is reinvesting a huge chunk of its profits at a high rate of return. This of course has caused the company to see substantial growth in its earnings. With that said, on studying the latest analyst forecasts, we found that while the company has seen growth in its past earnings, analysts expect its future earnings to shrink.

I always think about how Walmart is the biggest grocer in the US.

Its moves help improve important capital ratios and are a positive sign for investors drawn to the bank stock because of its 4.8% dividend yield. Here's what you need to know about the bank's recent moves."", 'Last year was tough for some regional banks. Interest rates had risen rapidly, and some banks struggled to adjust. Banks with niche customers, like Silicon Valley Bank, which serves venture capital and start-ups, saw deposit outflows while sitting on sizable losses (due to higher interest rates) on their loan portfolios.', 'Huntington Bancshares, the 20th largest bank in the U.S. by assets, took measures in March to protect itself from the threat of higher interest rates. The bank implemented a pay-fixed swaption program to protect the market value of its securities in the event interest rates jumped another two to three percentage points. This program functioned like insurance on its portfolio and hedged it against any future interest rate shocks.', 'Last month, the Federal Reserve held interest rates steady for the third consecutive meeting, and many expect that the aggressive interest rate hiking campaign is over for now.', ""Federal Reserve officials project that there could be three interest rate cuts in 2024. Meanwhile, CME Group's FedWatch Tool shows that market participants expect up to six rate cuts during the year. For this reason, Huntington no longer saw this hedge as necessary and recently closed out the program at a total cost of $24 million."", 'In another move, Huntington completed a synthetic credit risk transfer (CRT) transaction relating to $3 billion in prime indirect auto loans on its balance sheet. The transaction helped Huntington reduce its risk-weighted assets by about $2.4 billion.', ""Risk-weighted assets determine how much capital a bank must hold based on how risky those loans or other assets are. This measure is important for banks because it is used to calculate the Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1) ratio, which compares a bank's capital to its risk-weighted assets to determine how well it can withstand financial stress. Huntington's CET1 ratio had improved to 10.1% in the third quarter of this year compared to 9.27% one year earlier. By offloading these loans, Huntington modestly strengthened its CET1 ratio."", ""Huntington Bancshares' moves follow news of the FDIC's Deposit Insurance Fund Special Assessment. This assessment will replenish funds to the Deposit Insurance Fund, which took a hit when the agency protected uninsured depositors following the failures of Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank."", ""Huntington's share of this assessment will result in a $214 million in the fourth quarter, and the net of the moves will boost its CET1 ratio by 5 basis points, keeping it on the high end of its CET1 target range of 9% to 10%."", 'The move by Huntington Bancshares is a good one that helps moderately strengthen its financial position. The bank has an appealing dividend that yields 4.8% and a reasonable payout ratio of 41%. Investors can take comfort in seeing the bank making prudent moves to bolster its capital position, albeit modestly, to prepare for the Basel III endgame and other capital requirements as we enter 2024.', 'Huntington may benefit from other tailwinds next year. Falling interest rates could spur loan growth and help improve its net interest margin, which has declined from last year. By removing the hedge on its portfolio, Huntington is well positioned to benefit from interest rate cuts from here.', ""The bank's stock is down about 22% from its peak in January 2022 and trades at 8.3 times earnings -- below its 10-year average of 13.5. However, the stock has surged 38% over two months, and its price-to-tangible book value of 1.86 is above its 10-year average of 1.79. Therefore, investors may want to wait for a dip from here before adding shares of this high-yielding dividend stock."", 'Should you invest $1,000 in Huntington Bancshares right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Huntington Bancshares, consider this:', ""The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Huntington Bancshares wasn't one of them.

The company had an uphill battle against Apple\xa0and big tech giants like Amazon\xa0and Alphabet in building an audio business, but it's clear the focus on audio is paying off. Over the past five years, revenue more than doubled and the user base is now 574 million people, including 226 million who pay for Spotify Premium every month."", ""The advantage Spotify has over these competitors is its role as a horizontal services company.

The company owns about half of the Las Vegas Strip, has two resorts in Macao, and will open a massive casino in Osaka around 2030.', ""MGM's financials are steady, too, because Las Vegas and Macao are now in a cash-generation cycle after decades of investing in new resorts. If the Japanese casino market is as big as MGM hopes, this could be a very successful stock in the long term."", 'Peloton could be a juggernaut in fitness by 2030.

With that in mind, this article will work through how we can use Return On Equity (ROE) to better understand a business. By way of learning-by-doing, we'll look at ROE to gain a better understanding of MGM Resorts International (NYSE:MGM)."", ""Return on equity or ROE is a key measure used to assess how efficiently a company's management is utilizing the company's capital. In other words, it is a profitability ratio which measures the rate of return on the capital provided by the company's shareholders."", ' See our latest analysis for MGM Resorts International ', 'The formula for return on equity is:', ""Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' Equity"", 'So, based on the above formula, the ROE for MGM Resorts International is:', '14% = US$615m ÷ US$4.5b (Based on the trailing twelve months to September 2023).', ""The 'return' refers to a company's earnings over the last year. Another way to think of that is that for every $1 worth of equity, the company was able to earn $0.14 in profit."", 'One simple way to determine if a company has a good return on equity is to compare it to the average for its industry. The limitation of this approach is that some companies are quite different from others, even within the same industry classification. The image below shows that MGM Resorts International has an ROE that is roughly in line with the Hospitality industry average (16%).', ""So while the ROE is not exceptional, at least its acceptable. While at least the ROE is not lower than the industry, its still worth checking what role the company's debt plays as high debt levels relative to equity may also make the ROE appear high. If so, this increases its exposure to financial risk.  Our risks dashboardshould have the 4 risks we have identified for MGM Resorts International."", ""Virtually all companies need money to invest in the business, to grow profits. The cash for investment can come from prior year profits (retained earnings), issuing new shares, or borrowing. In the case of the first and second options, the ROE will reflect this use of cash, for growth. In the latter case, the debt required for growth will boost returns, but will not impact the shareholders' equity. That will make the ROE look better than if no debt was used."", ""MGM Resorts International clearly uses a high amount of debt to boost returns, as it has a debt to equity ratio of 1.46. There's no doubt its ROE is decent, but the very high debt the company carries is not too exciting to see. Debt does bring extra risk, so it's only really worthwhile when a company generates some decent returns from it."", 'Return on equity is useful for comparing the quality of different businesses. Companies that can achieve high returns on equity without too much debt are generally of good quality. If two companies have the same ROE, then I would generally prefer the one with less debt.', ""Having said that, while ROE is a useful indicator of business quality, you'll have to look at a whole range of factors to determine the right price to buy a stock. The rate at which profits are likely to grow, relative to the expectations of profit growth reflected in the current price, must be considered, too. So you might want to check this FREE visualization of analyst forecasts for the company."", 'If you would prefer check out another company -- one with potentially superior financials -- then do not miss this free list of interesting companies, that have HIGH return on equity and low debt.', 'Have feedback on this article?

For the full year, the price drop was about 61 cents per gallon.', 'And when crude benchmark Brent moved to almost $95 per barrel in September, the broad consensus was that the magical $100/b mark was inevitable. Instead, Brent closed the year at about $77/b — and settled less than $75/b a few times in December.', 'The oil industry doesn’t always agree on a lot of things, but on this one, there wasn’t a lot of disagreement to a consensus view that the biggest reason for that decline was the utterly unexpected surge in output from the U.S. oil sector. Crude production in the U.S. was about 12.2 million barrels per day when 2023 started; it was 13.3 million b/d by the end of the year, according to the DOE’s Energy Information Administration. If there were any forecasters who saw that coming, they kept themselves pretty quiet.', 'Big gains in output from Brazil and Guyana, among others, also helped to offset the OPEC+ decision in April to cut production by 500,000 b/d, an action that was followed by Saudi Arabia saying it would cut its output by an additional 1 million b/d.', 'But the impact of those reductions ultimately was balanced out — and then surpassed — by the surprise increases from those key non-OPEC producers, as well as several OPEC nations doing what the group long has been burdened by: members that sign on to a quota or a cutback and then promptly ignore it. Iran was the largest producer that fell into that category in the second half of 2023.', '', 'But for diesel consumers, 2023 marked a year when yes, the price went up and down with the direction of the crude market. But more importantly, the spread between diesel and crude remained elevated well beyond pre-pandemic norms, raising the question whether that gap is now the new normal. That spread is not just some analytical tool. It ultimately adds a few or many cents to the retail price of diesel compared to where it would have been pre-pandemic. And in 2023, by any measure, it was many cents.', 'A straight spread between the front month price of Brent and ultra low sulfur diesel on CME shows that the spread actually narrowed in 2023 compared to 2022. But the 2022 figures were inflated in part by the surge in the spread following the Russian invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. The full-year average in 2022 was about $1.18/g. For 2023, it narrowed to about 85 cents per gallon. In 2019, the last relatively “normal” year, that spread was about 41 cents per gallon.', 'Matt Smith, lead oil analyst for the Americas at the research firm of Kpler, said he sees that diesel spread moving back toward historic norms rather than to a more permanent higher level.', '“It’s just been such a tumultuous couple of years with everything that has happened with Russia,” Smith said, noting that various sanctions against Russia were levied against a major diesel exporter. “And so you will have the market recalibrate, essentially to make sure that the barrels get where they need to be or get produced where they need to be. And eventually we believe we will see that crack come down. It is just going to take a fair bit of time.”', 'Any discussion of oil products going into 2024, whether they be diesel, gasoline, jet fuel or anything else, eventually gets back to the white whale on the horizon: the Dangote refinery in Nigeria, which as 2024 starts is taking in crude to begin its operations after years of delays.', 'The giant 650,000 b/d refinery, one of the world’s largest, is expected to start operations at less than 400,000 b/d of crude throughput. Robert Auers, a refined fuels market analyst with RBN Energy, noted that Dangote is engineered to produce a gasoline-heavy output, not surprising given the light sweet crude that is predominant in Nigeria’s daily production of 1.5 million b/d, a figure that is well below previous output in the always inefficient Nigerian industry.', 'While the new refinery will produce diesel, Auers said the prevalence of gasoline output will impact diesel markets. “If they’re going to make a lot of gasoline, that would push diesel cracks even wider.”', 'He said RBN’s estimates are that global demand for middle distillates like diesel will rise 300,000 b/d in 2024, and given that gasoline supply is going to get a bigger boost out of Dangote than diesel, a $30/barrel spread of diesel over gasoline is not likely to drop below $20 in 2024.', 'Smith said Kpler sees total refinery capacity additions this year totaling 1.4 million b/d, including Dangote.', 'A growing source of diesel supplies in recent years has been renewable diesel (RD), especially on the West Coast. RD, unlike biodiesel, is a drop-in fuel that is heavily processed in a refinery and can be substituted on a one-for-one basis for petroleum diesel. A truck filling up with diesel in California is increasingly likely to be consuming RD without even knowing it.', 'David Hackett, president of Stillwater Associates, a West Coast-based transportation fuels analysis firm, said RD has been “the real success story of the low-carbon fuel effort.” Not only is its carbon footprint less than petroleum diesel, because its source are things like animal fats, restaurant grease and soybean oil, but “it’s really clean-burning stuff,” Hackett said. “It’s got great performance. Users like it.”', 'But the tremendous growth of RD production led by several refiners building new facilities, particularly on the West Coast, may be facing a shift in the plants’ economics that will deter future investment.', 'Megan Boutwell, the president of Stillwater, noted that credits for the production of low-carbon fuels under California’s Low Carbon Fuel Standard (LCFS) have dropped to about $70 per ton, a long slide that began at the beginning of 2021 near the price cap for the LCFS of $200/ton.', 'The LCFS is a system of carrots and sticks to incentivize the production of low-carbon fuels, like RD, that includes the ability to generate sellable credits if a company produces a low-carbon transportation fuel, like RD.', 'Boutwell said the decline in LCFS credit prices is impacting capital flows into some projects to produce RD, because those plans were drawn up when LCFS credits were more than current levels. The price of those credits is a key part of the economics of a plant.', '(Source: Neste)', 'She added that the number of LCFS credits being generated is adding to the “credit bank,” a sign of success in reducing the carbon intensity of California’s transportation fuels, but also pushing down the price to a level that may discourage future investments. The state in response, according to Boutwell, has recently announced several changes that will “drastically increase the deficit.” The goal is to boost the price of LCFS credits and support future investment.', 'Boutwell also downplayed concerns about an adequate supply of feedstocks to grow RD supplies in the future. “There’s enough demand for this product that the market will figure itself out,” she said. “There are innovative feedstocks out there.”', 'Looking at the macroeconomic picture for the supply and demand balance, Kpler’s Smith said most projections are for crude to be in surplus for at least the first third of the year.', '“That’s why you had Saudi Arabia come out and extend its [1 million b/d] cut,” Smith said, adding that Kpler expects the Saudi reduction to ultimately be in place for all of 2024.', 'In its most recent monthly production survey of OPEC+ output, S&P Global Commodity Insights estimated Saudi output at 9 million b/d. In January 2023, SPGCI estimated Saudi output at 10.42 million b/d.', 'Smith said Kpler’s estimate is that global demand growth in 2024 will be 1.2 million b/d; the International Energy Agency sees it at 1.1 million b/d. But that comes after a year in which the IEA said demand rose by 2.3 million b/d.', 'That level of growth is “pretty good,” Smith said. But given that supply imbalance fueled by countries where output keeps rising, “we’re expecting prices to remain fairly soft through the first half of next year and start picking up in the second half of the year.”', 'One addendum: while the war between Hamas and Israel has not had any impact on oil production in the Middle East, the rerouting of tankers around the Cape of Good Hope and away from the Red Sea and Suez Canal locks oil into lengthier inventory while it is being shipped. That’s a bullish factor. As always, geopolitical remains an oil market wild card.', 'More articles by John Kingston', 'SoCal warehouse emissions rule and possible impact on trucks upheld by judge', 'California holds off on only allowing zero-emission vehicles in drayage registry', 'Logistics M&A slower but opportunities still there', 'The post After 2023 price declines, diesel focus turns to its relationship to crude oil appeared first on FreightWaves.']"

Pick took over from Gorman on New Year's day, with Gorman staying on as executive chairman."", '“I do not want to be CEO anymore,” Gorman told the Financial Times. “I’ve loved it. I’ve loved all of it. I’ve done it for 14 years, that’s enough.”', 'Gorman is already adjusting to his new downsized role. As CEO, at the beginning of each year, he would make a handwritten list of his priorities for the 12 months ahead. When asked during a Bloomberg interview earlier this week how that list might change now that he’s executive chairman and had stepped away from overseeing Morgan Stanley’s day-to-day operations, Gorman replied: “I didn’t write it this year.”', 'While no longer a chief executive, Gorman will continue serving in top corporate posts in addition to his Morgan Stanley executive chairmanship, having been named to Disney’s board. In that role, Gorman may assist Disney with eventually finding a successor for its CEO, Bob Iger. Disney has struggled with doing so in recent years, leading to Iger’s returning for a second time as CEO in November 2022 after his successor, Bob Chapek, faltered.', 'Gorman announced his intention to step down in May, saying he would do so within the next 12 months. In October, Morgan Stanley announced that Pick, who was then co-president, would succeed Gorman at the beginning of this year.', 'During an almost decade and a half tenure, Gorman turned Morgan Stanley into the envy of Wall Street. The bank weathered the uncertainty and public distrust engendered by the 2008 financial crisis, outgrew virtually all of its European competitors such as Credit Suisse, Barclays, and Deutsche Bank, and made several big-money acquisitions to diversify from its trading and investment banking businesses.', 'Since January 2010, when Gorman was appointed, Morgan Stanley’s stock has more than tripled from around $30, to $92.39 as of Thursday. The bank’s annual net revenues also soared from $16.4 billion in Gorman’s first year to $53.7 billion in 2022, the last full year of financial information available.', 'In his Financial Times interview, Gorman rated his Morgan Stanley CEO tenure as an A–. Going higher would be “immodest,” while going any lower would be “false modesty,” he told the newspaper in December.', 'Much of Morgan Stanley’s new growth can be attributed to Gorman’s early efforts to expand the bank’s wealth and asset management business, which were previously afterthoughts to its primary banking and trading efforts. He still believes wealth and asset management is critical to growing Morgan Stanley internationally.', '“There are a lot of wealthy people in the world,” he said in the Bloomberg interview.', 'As he reflected on his time at Morgan Stanley, Gorman exuded confidence.', '“It might sound immodest but I don’t think we made a lot of mistakes,” he told Bloomberg.', 'Yet under his watch, Morgan Stanley had to pay several large fines following regulatory investigations. The largest came in 2022 when the bank agreed to pay $200 million to U.S. regulators after some of its employees engaged in improper record keeping when they discussed trades outside of sanctioned communications channels. Just a month later the SEC fined Morgan Stanley again as part of a $35 million settlement for failing to properly protect the data of 15 million customers.', 'Additionally, Morgan Stanley lost $911 million when the family office of Archegos Capital Management went under after it couldn’t cover a series of margin calls, which triggered a fire sale. Morgan Stanley, realizing Archegos was about to collapse, had to sell blocks of shares at a loss to mitigate the damage to its own balance sheet. And like many investors, the bank has suffered hundreds of millions of dollars in losses on commercial real estate loans in the aftermath of the pandemic.', 'Instead, Gorman prefers to focus on the wins, citing the acquisitions that enabled the bank’s asset and wealth management push. In February 2020, just weeks before the pandemic struck the U.S., Morgan Stanley bought brokerage app E-Trade for $13 billion. “I think they’re jealous,” Gorman said of other Wall Street banks that missed out on the deal. Undaunted by the pandemic, Gorman continued his shopping spree in October 2020, buying investment firm Eaton Vance for $7 billion.', '“I felt back then that we had to act, and we had to act aggressively,” he said of his early days as CEO and his turnaround plan. “And I knew that whatever we chose to do there would be critics.

For the full year, the price drop was about 61 cents per gallon.', 'And when crude benchmark Brent moved to almost $95 per barrel in September, the broad consensus was that the magical $100/b mark was inevitable. Instead, Brent closed the year at about $77/b — and settled less than $75/b a few times in December.', 'The oil industry doesn’t always agree on a lot of things, but on this one, there wasn’t a lot of disagreement to a consensus view that the biggest reason for that decline was the utterly unexpected surge in output from the U.S. oil sector. Crude production in the U.S. was about 12.2 million barrels per day when 2023 started; it was 13.3 million b/d by the end of the year, according to the DOE’s Energy Information Administration. If there were any forecasters who saw that coming, they kept themselves pretty quiet.', 'Big gains in output from Brazil and Guyana, among others, also helped to offset the OPEC+ decision in April to cut production by 500,000 b/d, an action that was followed by Saudi Arabia saying it would cut its output by an additional 1 million b/d.', 'But the impact of those reductions ultimately was balanced out — and then surpassed — by the surprise increases from those key non-OPEC producers, as well as several OPEC nations doing what the group long has been burdened by: members that sign on to a quota or a cutback and then promptly ignore it. Iran was the largest producer that fell into that category in the second half of 2023.', '', 'But for diesel consumers, 2023 marked a year when yes, the price went up and down with the direction of the crude market. But more importantly, the spread between diesel and crude remained elevated well beyond pre-pandemic norms, raising the question whether that gap is now the new normal. That spread is not just some analytical tool. It ultimately adds a few or many cents to the retail price of diesel compared to where it would have been pre-pandemic. And in 2023, by any measure, it was many cents.', 'A straight spread between the front month price of Brent and ultra low sulfur diesel on CME shows that the spread actually narrowed in 2023 compared to 2022. But the 2022 figures were inflated in part by the surge in the spread following the Russian invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. The full-year average in 2022 was about $1.18/g. For 2023, it narrowed to about 85 cents per gallon. In 2019, the last relatively “normal” year, that spread was about 41 cents per gallon.', 'Matt Smith, lead oil analyst for the Americas at the research firm of Kpler, said he sees that diesel spread moving back toward historic norms rather than to a more permanent higher level.', '“It’s just been such a tumultuous couple of years with everything that has happened with Russia,” Smith said, noting that various sanctions against Russia were levied against a major diesel exporter. “And so you will have the market recalibrate, essentially to make sure that the barrels get where they need to be or get produced where they need to be. And eventually we believe we will see that crack come down. It is just going to take a fair bit of time.”', 'Any discussion of oil products going into 2024, whether they be diesel, gasoline, jet fuel or anything else, eventually gets back to the white whale on the horizon: the Dangote refinery in Nigeria, which as 2024 starts is taking in crude to begin its operations after years of delays.', 'The giant 650,000 b/d refinery, one of the world’s largest, is expected to start operations at less than 400,000 b/d of crude throughput. Robert Auers, a refined fuels market analyst with RBN Energy, noted that Dangote is engineered to produce a gasoline-heavy output, not surprising given the light sweet crude that is predominant in Nigeria’s daily production of 1.5 million b/d, a figure that is well below previous output in the always inefficient Nigerian industry.', 'While the new refinery will produce diesel, Auers said the prevalence of gasoline output will impact diesel markets. “If they’re going to make a lot of gasoline, that would push diesel cracks even wider.”', 'He said RBN’s estimates are that global demand for middle distillates like diesel will rise 300,000 b/d in 2024, and given that gasoline supply is going to get a bigger boost out of Dangote than diesel, a $30/barrel spread of diesel over gasoline is not likely to drop below $20 in 2024.', 'Smith said Kpler sees total refinery capacity additions this year totaling 1.4 million b/d, including Dangote.', 'A growing source of diesel supplies in recent years has been renewable diesel (RD), especially on the West Coast. RD, unlike biodiesel, is a drop-in fuel that is heavily processed in a refinery and can be substituted on a one-for-one basis for petroleum diesel. A truck filling up with diesel in California is increasingly likely to be consuming RD without even knowing it.', 'David Hackett, president of Stillwater Associates, a West Coast-based transportation fuels analysis firm, said RD has been “the real success story of the low-carbon fuel effort.” Not only is its carbon footprint less than petroleum diesel, because its source are things like animal fats, restaurant grease and soybean oil, but “it’s really clean-burning stuff,” Hackett said. “It’s got great performance. Users like it.”', 'But the tremendous growth of RD production led by several refiners building new facilities, particularly on the West Coast, may be facing a shift in the plants’ economics that will deter future investment.', 'Megan Boutwell, the president of Stillwater, noted that credits for the production of low-carbon fuels under California’s Low Carbon Fuel Standard (LCFS) have dropped to about $70 per ton, a long slide that began at the beginning of 2021 near the price cap for the LCFS of $200/ton.', 'The LCFS is a system of carrots and sticks to incentivize the production of low-carbon fuels, like RD, that includes the ability to generate sellable credits if a company produces a low-carbon transportation fuel, like RD.', 'Boutwell said the decline in LCFS credit prices is impacting capital flows into some projects to produce RD, because those plans were drawn up when LCFS credits were more than current levels. The price of those credits is a key part of the economics of a plant.', '(Source: Neste)', 'She added that the number of LCFS credits being generated is adding to the “credit bank,” a sign of success in reducing the carbon intensity of California’s transportation fuels, but also pushing down the price to a level that may discourage future investments. The state in response, according to Boutwell, has recently announced several changes that will “drastically increase the deficit.” The goal is to boost the price of LCFS credits and support future investment.', 'Boutwell also downplayed concerns about an adequate supply of feedstocks to grow RD supplies in the future. “There’s enough demand for this product that the market will figure itself out,” she said. “There are innovative feedstocks out there.”', 'Looking at the macroeconomic picture for the supply and demand balance, Kpler’s Smith said most projections are for crude to be in surplus for at least the first third of the year.', '“That’s why you had Saudi Arabia come out and extend its [1 million b/d] cut,” Smith said, adding that Kpler expects the Saudi reduction to ultimately be in place for all of 2024.', 'In its most recent monthly production survey of OPEC+ output, S&P Global Commodity Insights estimated Saudi output at 9 million b/d. In January 2023, SPGCI estimated Saudi output at 10.42 million b/d.', 'Smith said Kpler’s estimate is that global demand growth in 2024 will be 1.2 million b/d; the International Energy Agency sees it at 1.1 million b/d. But that comes after a year in which the IEA said demand rose by 2.3 million b/d.', 'That level of growth is “pretty good,” Smith said. But given that supply imbalance fueled by countries where output keeps rising, “we’re expecting prices to remain fairly soft through the first half of next year and start picking up in the second half of the year.”', 'One addendum: while the war between Hamas and Israel has not had any impact on oil production in the Middle East, the rerouting of tankers around the Cape of Good Hope and away from the Red Sea and Suez Canal locks oil into lengthier inventory while it is being shipped. That’s a bullish factor. As always, geopolitical remains an oil market wild card.', 'More articles by John Kingston', 'SoCal warehouse emissions rule and possible impact on trucks upheld by judge', 'California holds off on only allowing zero-emission vehicles in drayage registry', 'Logistics M&A slower but opportunities still there', 'The post After 2023 price declines, diesel focus turns to its relationship to crude oil appeared first on FreightWaves.']"

The vested interest of brokerage firms in a stock they cover often results in a strong positive bias of their analysts in rating it.

It is displayed in whole numbers -- 1 to 5.', ""It has been and continues to be the case that analysts employed by brokerage firms are overly optimistic with their recommendations. Because of their employers' vested interests, these analysts issue more favorable ratings than their research would support, misguiding investors far more often than helping them."", 'In contrast, the Zacks Rank is driven by earnings estimate revisions. And near-term stock price movements are strongly correlated with trends in earnings estimate revisions, according to empirical research.', 'Furthermore, the different grades of the Zacks Rank are applied proportionately across all stocks for which brokerage analysts provide earnings estimates for the current year. In other words, at all times, this tool maintains a balance among the five ranks it assigns.', 'There is also a key difference between the ABR and Zacks Rank when it comes to freshness.

This fan loyalty is especially evident among younger demos like Millennials and Gen Z. As they gain more discretionary income, I believe Apple is primed for enduring success. Its brand has become nearly synonymous with innovation and prestige.', 'Could Apple still innovate more rapidly? Sure. But its incremental improvements still compel upgrades while blue-sky projects percolate behind the scenes. For these reasons, I remain confident Apple has a bright future indeed. Its premium valuation is warranted. This cash cow will keep churning out new gadgets we can’t live without — and handsome returns for shareholders.

This triopoly is unlikely to fracture anytime soon; credit ratings greatly influence debt markets.', 'When companies want to issue bonds or loans, they desperately need the blessing of Moody’s ratings. That imbues MCO with great pricing power. And coming off a 2022 dip, shares have mounted a resilient recovery, supported by 26% profit margins and 16% sales growth last quarter.

Their global payment rails are supremely profitable and wouldn’t be easy to replicate. To me, Visa gets the slight edge for its dividend, while Mastercard wins on buybacks. But either delivers strong ownership merits.', 'Case in point: Visa posted 11% sales growth and 54% net margins — still expanding! The toll road for money flows, its network should keep driving sustainable double-digit earnings growth for years to come. And it returns excess cash to shareholders, with dividends rising 16 straight years. Visa yields just 0.8% but has greater room for payout hikes.

It’s projected 4.4% 2024 (company FY25) sales growth and further expansion thereafter make me optimistic. And unlike most discounters, DG pays dividends with a 1.7% yield — payouts, I think, will rise nicely if profits rebound as predicted.

Last year, it was revealed the hedge fund manager opened a position in Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL), the parent company of internet search tool Google and video sharing platform YouTube.', ""Ackman's investment strategy is quite simple. While other institutional investors tend to own several stocks in each sector, Ackman instead identifies a small cohort of businesses that he believes are overlooked and potentially undervalued -- making it easy to understand which stocks he appreciates over the competition. For this reason, Ackman's stake in Alphabet represented something greater than just a new position. Rather, it signaled his conviction in the company's position among artificial intelligence (AI) leaders. But why?"", 'During a recent interview with David Rubinstein, a co-founder of private equity giant Carlyle, Ackman revealed that he thinks investors can buy Alphabet\'s AI business ""for free."" While this is quite the conjecture, I think he\'s right.', 'Let\'s dig into why Alphabet might just be the most overlooked AI stock among the ""Magnificent Seven.""', ""At its core, Alphabet is an advertising business. Given that Google and YouTube are the world's top two most-visited websites, it's easy to comprehend why advertisers flock to these platforms. Moreover, with Alphabet's surface area online, the company can command strong pricing power from customers."", ""This business model has historically resulted in strong revenue growth and, more importantly, robust margin expansion for Alphabet. However, the last couple of years haven't gone so well for the company."", 'For starters, the macroeconomy was plagued with high inflation, thereby causing the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates nearly a dozen times. As a result, businesses of all sizes reined in spending and operated under tighter budgets. Very few businesses were immune to these dynamics, and the already cyclical advertising sector was no exception.', ""In addition to broader market dynamics, Alphabet's advertising operation also faces increasing competition. The popularity of social media app TikTok, combined with other major players such as Meta (which owns Facebook and Instagram), put Alphabet in a tough spot. In fact, Alphabet's advertising revenue in the fourth quarter of 2022 actually declined on a year-over-year basis, spooking investors about the company's prospects."", 'However, perhaps its biggest challenge comes from Microsoft. The Windows developer arguably kicked off the artificial intelligence (AI) arms race early last year following a $10 billion investment in OpenAI, the start-up behind ChatGPT.', ""Microsoft's perceived first-mover advantage in AI, coupled with intensifying competition and a tough economy, had many investors questioning how dominant Alphabet's future within Internet search and advertising may be. Unsurprisingly, the stock cratered nearly 40% in 2022."", ""Although it can be easy to be persuaded by mainstream sentiment, long-term investors can often think beyond whatever crisis is currently taking place. Alphabet no doubt faced headwinds in its core advertising segment. But keep in mind, it's this business that fueled billions in free cash flow for Alphabet over the years and provided the company the financial fuel to invest in other areas."", ""While investors started to sour on Alphabet in 2022, the company remained focused and found ways to diversify its business -- namely through strategic acquisitions. The company's investment in cybersecurity infrastructure has played an integral role in the development of its cloud computing operation, which is taking on industry stalwarts Amazon and Microsoft."", ""In fact, the growth of Alphabet's cloud business has been a pillar in the company's AI pursuit. This is a big deal, and subtly underscores why Ackman sees Alphabet's AI business as free."", ""Alphabet stock rebounded nearly 60% in 2023. Keep in mind, however, that the company only increased its total revenue by 7% year over year through Sept. 30. Perhaps what sparked renewed investor enthusiasm was Alphabet's return to growth in advertising. While encouraging, it's this dynamic that has me thinking investors are missing the bigger picture."", ""Alphabet's cloud segment increased sales by 26% year over year through Sept. 30, and it is now consistently generating positive operating income. Artificial intelligence (AI) applications are increasingly becoming integrated throughout Alphabet's cloud offerings, helping spark rising demand over the competition."", ""Moreover, Alphabet swiftly answered Microsoft's call and hasn't been shy about showing off its own AI capabilities. The latest installment from the company is its ChatGPT competitor, called Gemini. As Alphabet continues to integrate AI across its suite of productivity tools, cloud infrastructure, Google Search, and YouTube, more accelerated revenue and profit growth could follow."", 'Yet, as of this writing, Alphabet stock trades at only a 20.7 forward price-to-earnings (P/E) multiple -- nearly identical to that of the S&P 500. By contrast, Apple, which is experiencing declining revenue, trades at a forward P/E of 28, while Microsoft trades at 33 times forward earnings.', ""I think Ackman is right in that many investors appear to be completely overlooking Alphabet's AI progress -- not even realizing that it's AI that helped reignite the company's growth. To me, Alphabet's bargain valuation offers investors an opportunity to own a leading AI developer at a steep discount relative to the competition."", 'Should you invest $1,000 in Alphabet right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Alphabet, consider this:', ""The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Alphabet wasn't one of them.

Since the debut of Google Search in 1997, the company has dominated the landscape, currently controlling 92% of the market, according to internet statistics aggregator StatCounter. Google search acts as a conduit for Alphabet's industry-leading online advertising business. It was responsible for 30% of digital ad sales worldwide in 2022, according to data compiled by online industry publication Digiday. It's unlikely that would have changed much in 2023, though the final tally isn't yet available."", ""There's no question the digital advertising industry has faced headwinds over the past couple of years, as marketing budgets have historically been slashed in the face of economic uncertainty -- and the recent bear market was no different."", ""It appears the tide has turned, and online advertising is on the rebound. After declining for several consecutive quarters, Google's ad sales have posted year-over-year increases in each of the previous two quarters, and that trend is expected to continue. As the industry leader, Alphabet has the most to benefit from the recovery."", 'Last but certainly not least is Alphabet\'s competitive position in cloud infrastructure services as No. 3 of the ""Big 3"" cloud providers. Amazon Web Services and Microsoft Azure are No. 1 and No. 2, respectively.', 'For most of the past several years, Google Cloud has been the fastest-growing of the three, though it recently ceded that title (at least temporarily) to Microsoft. Azure was quick to offer artificial intelligence (AI) services to its cloud customers, which helped the company gain market share. Google has since launched its own set of cloud-related AI tools, which could help change the dynamic.', 'The advent of generative AI last year caused a stir because of its ability to create original content and streamline mundane and time-consuming tasks. As a result, businesses are scrambling to take advantage of the resulting increases in productivity. No one knows how lucrative AI will ultimately be, but most experts place the market opportunity in the trillions of dollars -- though estimates vary wildly.', 'Alphabet recognized the opportunity and rolled out a number of AI-powered offerings, which include more than 100 built AI models, via its Vertex AI platform. This accelerates the time it takes to adopt AI and helps Google Cloud users ""build, deploy, and scale AI-powered applications,"" the company says.', 'It recently introduced Duet AI, which it says was ""specifically trained to help users be more productive on Google Cloud."" Duet was also integrated into Alphabet\'s cybersecurity, search, and a variety of other products and services.', ""The most recent development was last month's introduction of Google Gemini, the next-generation large language model that underpins its AI. Early assessments suggest that Gemini offers five times greater computational capacity than OpenAI's GPT-4, according to tests conducted by semiconductor research company SemiAnalysis. This could mark a big step forward for Alphabet's AI ambitions."", ""Google has a keen advantage as one of the major cloud providers, offering it a built-in delivery mechanism for getting AI into the hands of customers. Needham analyst Laura Martin suggested that generative AI will help catapult Alphabet's market cap to $3 trillion in the coming years, or a potential upside of about 73% compared to Wednesday's closing price."", ""As outlined above, there's a lot to like about Alphabet. The company leads the way in search and digital advertising and is a keen competitor in cloud infrastructure services. There are other opportunities, which include YouTube (its ubiquitous streaming service) and its autonomous driving platform Waymo."", 'Those opportunities aside, perhaps the most compelling reason to buy Alphabet is its sticker price.

The pharmacy company is cutting its dividend by nearly 50%. That ended a streak of 47 years of dividend growth. ', ""That reduction will enable Walgreens to retain more cash to fund its growth and strengthen its balance sheet. Here's a look at whether now's the time to buy the beaten-down member of the Dow Jones Industrial Average, which lost 30% of its value last year compared to the iconic index's nearly 14% rise. "", 'Walgreens had a rich history of paying dividends. The integrated healthcare, pharmacy, and retail company has paid dividends for 364 straight quarters (91 years). It had increased its payout for 47 consecutive years. That put it among the dividend elite and only a few years away from becoming a Dividend King (companies with 50 or more years of dividend increases). ', ""While Walgreens had done an excellent job paying a rising dividend over the years, growth has slowed significantly. Technically, the company didn't increase its dividend in 2023. It has paid the same rate ($0.48 per share) for the last six quarters. However, its total payment in 2023 was higher than 2022's level due to a 0.5% increase in mid-2022, enabling the company to count last year toward its streak. Meanwhile, its growth rate has decelerated (2% in 2021, 2.2% in 2020, and 4% in 2019). "", ""On top of that slowing growth, its slumping stock price caused its dividend yield to rise to more than 7.5%. That elevated yield suggested that investors thought it was at high risk of a reduction. That's exactly what has happened this year, with Walgreens cutting its quarterly payout from $0.48 to $0.25 per share (pushing the yield down to a still attractive 4.3%). "", ""The main factor driving Walgreens' decision to slash its dividend was its weakening financial profile. Its earnings and cash flow are falling, while its balance sheet is weakening."", 'In fiscal 2023, Walgreens produced about $2.3 billion in operating cash flow and $665 million in free cash flow. Operating cash flow was down more than $1.6 billion from fiscal 2022 due partly to a reduction in pandemic-driven contributions. That weighed on free cash flow, which was lower by $1.5 billion. With nearly $1.7 billion in dividend payments, Walgreens outspent its operating cash flow by $1 billion over the past fiscal year.

However, he stated, “In every country where we operate, including in Muslim countries, McDonald’s is proudly represented by local owner operators who work tirelessly to serve and support their communities while employing thousands of their fellow citizens.”', 'His comments come a few months after a McDonald’s operator in Israel had been offering discounts to soldiers, security forces and others since the October 7 assault by Hamas militants in Israel.', 'Many McDonald’s operators in the region quickly distanced themselves from the Israeli operator’s actions. Franchise groups in Kuwait, Pakistan and other countries issued statements saying they did not share ownership with the Israeli franchise, and some of those franchises noted they have made financial donations to aid those in Gaza.', 'At issue is McDonald’s franchise model, in which independently owned and operated restaurants make decisions separately from the company. Customers might be unaware of the distinction and believe an action one location takes is always officially sanctioned by the McDonald’s corporation or reflective of the positions of other locations.', 'The vast majority of McDonald’s locations are run by local franchise operators. These operators act in many ways as independent businesses: They set wages and prices and, when they feel it appropriate, make statements or donations at their discretion. That approach has helped make McDonald’s a global phenomenon, with over 40,000 locations globally, including nearly 27,000 outside of the United States, as of 2022. But it means the company can’t dictate how each operator responds in a crisis, for better or worse.', 'McDonald’s is expected to report earnings later this month, when it could reveal more about the issues mentioned by Kempczinski.', 'In December 2023, Starbucks made comments about people protesting the company and disrupting its stores over the Israel-Hamas war.', '“We see protestors influenced by misrepresentation on social media of what we stand for,” said Starbucks CEO Laxman Narasimhan in a letter to employees and customers.', '“Cities around the world – including here in North America – have seen escalating protests.

Vachris is a 40-year Costco veteran who began working at the retailer as a forklift driver.', 'The Teamsters Local 822 said it was the union’s first organizing victory at Costco in two decades.', 'The longtime lag in such efforts, particularly at Costco, might be because the company is often touted as a worker-friendly employer.', 'While its discount shoppers love its low-priced everyday offering such as the popular $4.99 rotisserie chicken and the $1.50 hot dogs among other pantry staples such as cartons of canned beans and multipacks of toilet paper, Costco has also been applauded over the years for its worker-friendly policies, such as higher starting hourly wage and affordable healthcare benefits, which kick in after 180 days of employment for new hires.', 'The retailer is touted as having among the lowest turnover rates in the retailing industry.', 'In stark contract to Costco’s response, other companies such as Starbucks have pushed back hard against union organizing.', 'Nearly two years ago, the first Starbucks location voted to unionize, setting off a national campaign to organize. In that period, Starbucks has been fighting the effort, in some cases acting illegally, according to preliminary findings from the National Labor Relations Board. Starbucks is currently facing hundreds of unfair labor practice charges.', 'Elsewhere, the rise of organizing activity has prompted a range of responses from top tech companies. Amazon has so far refused to recognize its first union and engage in negotiations after a landmark union win last spring and continues to fight its legitimacy.', 'But another tech giant, Microsoft, has publicly embraced its first union and said last January that it looked “forward to engaging in good faith negotiations as we work towards a collective bargaining agreement.”', 'Unionized activity in retailing is not very common, said Burt Flickinger, retail industry analyst and managing director of retail consultancy Strategic Resource Group. “It’s between 6% to 10%,” he said, adding that that compares with as much as 20% to 40% in the public sector.', 'At the same time, he said the Costco workers’ win in Norfolk could become the harbinger of Teamsters and UFCW unions’ push to organize more of retail.', '“Their number one target by far is Amazon followed by Walmart,” Flickinger said.', 'CNN’s Danielle Wiener-Bronner and Catherine Thorbecke contributed to this story.', 'For more CNN news and newsletters create an account at CNN.com']"

Although moderating, the overall inflationary landscape has spiked up input costs for manufacturers and also weighed on consumers’ purchasing power, thereby affecting companies’ sales volumes.That being said, robust pricing initiatives have been helping food companies in countering cost headwinds. This, along with brand-enhancement strategies, has been working well for Mondelez International, Inc. MDLZ, The Kraft Heinz Company KHC, Sysco Corporation SYY and Ingredion Incorporated INGR.', 'About the Industry', 'The Zacks Food-Miscellaneous industry consists of companies that manufacture and sell a wide range of food and packaged food items, such as cereals, flour, sauces, bakery items, spices and condiments, natural and organic food items and frozen products. Some companies also provide comfort food items, such as chocolates and ready-to-serve meals, soups and snacks. A few players are engaged in providing pet food products and supplements. Several food companies also offer organic and natural products. Companies operating in this space sell their products mostly through wholesalers, distributors, large retail organizations, grocery chains, mass merchandisers, drug stores and e-commerce service providers. Some also cater to foodservice channels, including restaurants, cafes and hotels. Others offer services to schools, hospitals and industry caterers.', 'Major Trends Shaping the Future of the Food Industry', ""Refining Portfolio & Strengthening Brands: Brand strength has been a major upside for food companies. Consumers’ loyalty to specific brands, combined with companies' unwavering focus on innovation, has been a driving force. For instance, companies have been responding well to the growing consumer preference for healthy and nourishing food by introducing innovations in the organic product sector. Apart from this, endeavors to enhance manufacturing capabilities and strengthen product portfolios have proven successful for numerous food companies, positioning them favorably for future growth. Their ability to adapt to evolving consumer preferences and market dynamics has emerged as a winning formula.Proactive Pricing Endeavors: Food companies have found relief in their effective pricing measures amid the industry-wide cost inflation. As the demand for food products remains relatively stable, consumers generally absorb the increase in prices for their preferred brands. We believe that the ability to set prices competitively will continue to be advantageous for food companies, contributing to their sales and overall performance.Elevated Costs: Although showing moderation, input cost inflation has been a drag on companies’ margins. Food companies have been witnessing the increased cost of ingredients, which, along with high labor, packaging and logistic costs, has been weighing on its profits. Apart from this, companies have been facing escalating operational expenses in their efforts to step up performance. The persistence of these aspects remains a concern for food players’ profits.Volume Concerns: Food companies have been seeing soft volumes for a while due to a volatile macroeconomic landscape. The inflationary landscape pinched consumers’ pockets, leading them to look for budget-friendly alternatives and shift from big brands toward private-label companies. This has been hampering the sales volume of many food giants. However, the trend has been improving now."", 'Zacks Industry Rank Indicates Solid Prospects', 'The Zacks Food-Miscellaneous industry is housed within the broader Zacks Consumer Staples sector.

Investors cheered the development, sending shares of Southwest up 12.9% for the month, according to data provided by S&P Global Market Intelligence.', 'It has been a turbulent few years for the airline industry. The pandemic all but destroyed demand for travel, but in the quarters since the vaccines were released, airlines have enjoyed strong demand and domestic pricing power.', 'But beneath the surface, the industry remained vulnerable. Airlines offered buyouts to workers during the pandemic to try to reduce costs and were left severely understaffed as demand returned. Heading into 2023, investors faced uncertainty about costs as inflation and oil prices took their toll and labor contracts came up for renegotiation at a time when demand for pilots was outstripping supply.', 'Delta Air Lines reached a new agreement with its pilot union in the spring, and American Airlines Group and United Airlines Holdings followed in the summer and fall. That left only Southwest among the major U.S. carriers and created a lot of questions for investors.', 'In mid-December, Southwest and its pilot union reached a tentative agreement on a new, five-year deal that includes 50% cumulative pay increases over the life of the contract. The deal, which requires pilot approval, would provide a 29.5% pay increase upon signing. It would bring the hourly rate of a 12-year plus captain to $368.47 by 2028.', ""The new pilots deal means higher costs for Southwest, but that's better than continued uncertainty and the inability to plan due to not having a deal. With pilots across the industry all getting a step up in pay simultaneously, Southwest will be able to adapt to the new contract and figure out how to fly profitably."", 'The certainty is good because Southwest faces other challenges heading into the new year. Inflation and the potential for a slowing job market, coupled with a return of student loan payments, could crimp the consumer in the months ahead and lead to a slowdown in demand. And Southwest, once the plucky upstart, now faces pressure from discounters like Frontier Group Holdings and Allegiant Travel. This is a cyclical business that tends to ebb and flow with the economy, and Southwest is largely at the mercy of macroforces in the quarters to come.', 'Southwest has been a reliable long-term hold, but the stock appears to be fairly valued following its December surge.

You have to do more than that.”', 'The challenge for new PayPal CEO Alex Chriss is to build a robust line of services for both merchants and consumers on the platform, Katri maintains.', 'Along with reinvesting in consumer experience, Golding said that he is interested to see how new leadership is going to expand the platform among small and medium-sized businesses and growing the margins around businesses such as BrainTree.', 'To see the full Lead This Way episode: Dan Schulman: The CEO who made PayPal a household name, click here.', ""JULIE HYMAN: And that new chapter is already underway for PayPal with new leader Alex Chriss at the helm as of September.

I would say that Dan has really gone through some pretty tough hurdles anywhere from a prolonged headwinds from transitioning away from eBay to having to go through a normalization phase of e-commerce growth from very high pre-pandemic levels. And you know what, he did build a hell of a company that has a very strong two-sided platform, one servicing merchants. It's very sticky. And then the other one servicing roughly about 400 consumers, 400 million consumers. And that's also relatively sticky."", ""I'm just going to end this what I have to say with one sentence. And I think it's really important here. What Paypal's gone through in the past year and a half is really a symptom of pretty much every single fintech company in this universe. You cannot exclusively rely on transaction fees in terms of revenue generation. You have to do more than that. And this is really the challenge for the incoming CEO, building a very robust value-added services on both sides of the platform."", ""JOSH LIPTON: Paul, I want to bring you in here as well. And Moshe talked about the new CEO there. And there's a new man in charge, Alex Chriss, comes over from Intuit, Paul. And he's outlined some of his priorities. Already, he talks about customer experience. He talks about margin expansion, Paul. I just want to know, do you think he's outlining the right priorities in your opinion?"", '- Well, as you mentioned, the three key priorities that we highlighted from the prior earnings call were investing in the consumer experience, growing margin particularly around the unbranded Braintree product and transaction margin, and also emphasizing the SMB, the Small and Medium Business cohort, particularly through PPCP, the PayPal Complete Payments Platform, which is tailored to SMBs.', ""PAUL GOLDING: In terms of those priorities, we talk about this in our research, the user interface and customer experience, Dan Schulman invested in this over the course of his tenure. So we'll be curious to see what Alex Chriss comes in and does that reinvigorates this relative to what we've seen prior and what has been done consistently."", 'On transaction margin as was discussed prior in the segment, as unbranded volumes continue to outpace branded, this transaction margin headwind continues to be a tough hurdle to overcome in terms of seeing transaction margin momentum go to the upside and see expansion. So the volumes are good. But the transaction margin does see pressure from that.', ""And then lastly on the SMB front, we've seen SMB platforms focus on this cohort. We cover Block. Block has historically been very SMB focused. So this isn't necessarily revolutionary in our view as we've seen other platforms go after this cohort on software and services sell-through as well. So it'll be interesting to see how PayPal leverages its scale and recognition in the marketplace to maybe do more with these themes that have been worked through already to some extent."", 'JULIE HYMAN: And so, Moshe, are you confident that Alex Chriss can overcome some of those transaction fee challenges? Are you optimistic about his leadership now at PayPal?', ""MOSHE KATRI: And this is where his background could be pretty instrumental, given what he's done in his past life on the SMB space. So that's number one. And given the fact that you really have to build or rebuild an ecosystem of products and services servicing-- facing both the merchant side of the business and the consumers, and if he's able to do that, I think you you're going to have a pretty stable business that has a sticky model on both sides. And you should be able to, at least hypothetically, given the fact that you will be relying less on transaction volumes, you should be able to address the margin compression issue that they've had for about a year and a half now."", ""JOSH LIPTON: And, Paul, I also want to talk about competition in this space, because, obviously, PayPal has a lot of it. It's everyone from Apple to Shopify. What are-- in that fight, Paul, what are Paypal's competitive advantages as you see it?"", ""PAUL GOLDING: Well, scale, the most recently reported 428 million actives. And they've got about 35 million merchant accounts, which is substantial scale relative to the competition. They also have something that while others have this as well, they don't necessarily have it at the same scale that PayPal has, which is a merchant side of the house and a consumer side of the house. And to marry those ecosystems as they have done for quite some time and continue to do with various discovery tools that merge those ecosystems and allow for retargeting and promotion, that all helps drive this ecosystem flywheel that can drive margin, drive inflows, and help boost their overall margin profile."", ""JULIE HYMAN: And, guys, before we go, I want to ask you both what your top picks in the sector are. We've been focusing on PayPal, obviously, with a little bit of talk about Block also. So, Moshe, I'll start with you. What's your top pick?"", ""PAUL GOLDING: I'll give it to you in a second. I just want to add one more thing in terms of what's also unique for Paypal's merchants business, which is a conversion rate. Paypal's merchant platform is very stable and very sticky, given the fact that merchants that actually use the PayPal button have very high conversion rates. And that's why it's been so sticky."", ""We've been in general pretty defensive on the space. And for example, we like the networks, we like Visa. And then we also like some of the more legacy merchant processors. I would include their Pfizer, Global Payments, and then the last one is PayPal."", 'JULIE HYMAN: And what about you, Paul?', ""MOSHE KATRI: We're outperform on the space as well. We like the networks as well. But top pick, Block probably at this point, just given the inflection point here on cost-outs and what we might see in terms of overall trajectory of that margin expansion potential relative to a more mature platform like PayPal."", 'JOSH LIPTON: All right. Moshe, Paul, thank you, guys, both for joining today. Appreciate the time and the insight there.', 'PAUL GOLDING: Thanks.']"

Recently, American Tower’s remarkable $14.86 billion in ETF-held stock earned it a spot among the Top 25 “Dividend Giants.”', 'Financially, AMT demonstrates robust growth and resilience. Despite a dip in net income, its third-quarter financials show a 5.5% bump in total revenue year-over-year (YOY), reaching $2.82 billion. This increase can be primarily attributed to a 7% growth in property revenue. Furthermore, adjusted EBITDA grew by 10.4% to $1.8 billion, underscoring the company’s solid financial footing.', 'Consequently, American Tower emerges as a compelling investment opportunity. Analysts’ strong buy ratings and a high estimate of $259, signaling a 20% upside potential, reinforce AMT’s position as a top choice for investors seeking growth and stability in the real estate stocks sector.', 'Source: Shutterstock', 'Realty Income (NYSE:O), a standout in the real estate sector for 2024, saw a 9.69% dip in price in 2023, trading at a mere 1.32 times book value.

Its resilience and proven track record in the market spotlight its potential as a robust investment.', 'Nevertheless, the company faces potential challenges, particularly from its upcoming acquisition of Spirit Realty Capital (NYSE:SRC), set to conclude in early 2024. While this expansion signifies strength, it also introduces risks of overvaluation and dilution, somewhat shadowing its immediate positive outlook.', 'Despite these headwinds, Realty Income’s foray into higher-risk sectors like gambling represents a bold strategic shift. This diversification, while risky, could offer new growth avenues. Considering its attractive 5.25% forward yield and current valuation, Realty Income stands as a compelling investment in 2024, blending risk with potential reward in the evolving real estate market.', 'Source: Monkey Business Images / Shutterstock.com', 'Ventas (NYSE:VTR) stands out in the healthcare real estate sector.

Notably, net operating income increased by 5.1% YOY, and same-store cash net operating income soared by 7.9%. These solid results stemmed from higher occupancy rates and enhanced revenue per occupied room, alongside well-managed operating expenses, leading to a notable margin expansion.', 'Despite a net loss per share of 18 cents, largely due to non-cash impairments, the company’s dividend remains steady at 45 cents per share, yielding 3.53%.

With consumers becoming increasingly value-conscious, discount retailers are well-positioned to cater to this demand. The industry's resilience, especially during economic uncertainties, is bolstered by the sector's ability to offer cost-effective products.Moreover, the integration of advanced technologies like data analytics and artificial intelligence allows retailers to optimize their operations, personalize customer experiences and enhance overall efficiency, ensuring a competitive edge in the market. Additionally, retailers such as Costco Wholesale Corporation COST, The TJX Companies, Inc. TJX, Target Corporation TGT and Ross Stores, Inc. ROST have been deepening engagements with consumers and adding more compelling products."", 'About the Industry', 'The Retail – Discount Stores industry is a significant segment within the retail sector that caters to price-conscious consumers seeking value-for-money products. These stores specialize in offering a wide range of merchandise, including groceries, household items, apparel, electronics, cleaning products, pet supplies and more, at discounted prices compared to traditional retail outlets. Discount stores operate on a low-cost business model, focusing on cost-efficient operations, bulk purchasing and streamlined supply chains to offer competitive pricing. These stores often carry both national and private-label brands, providing a mix of products to cater to a diverse customer base. The Retail – Discount Stores industry has shown resilience even during economic downturns as consumers tend to prioritize value-oriented shopping.', '4 Key Industry Trends to Watch', ""Consumers’ Willingness to Spend: The performance of the industry is closely tied to consumers’ purchasing power. Consumer spending, a key catalyst for the economy, has shown resilience despite a tough economic environment. Retail sales in November rose 0.3% sequentially and 4.1% year over year. The backdrop of healthy employment and wage gains has so far bolstered consumer spending. Anticipating a potential interest rate cut by the Federal Reserve in 2024, especially if inflation continues its downward trend, there is an expectation of a further boost to consumer spending. The industry's impressive performance underscores its ability to adapt and thrive in the dynamic market conditions. Consumer confidence has been a driving force behind the sector's success. Recent data from the Conference Board reveals a remarkable surge in the Consumer Confidence Index, reaching 110.7 in December — its highest point since July."", 'Consumers Seek Better Bargains: The strategy to sell products at discounted prices has helped industry players draw customers in low-to-middle-income groups who have been seeking both value and convenience, particularly in the face of rising prices. Industry participants have been focusing on creating innovative and compelling products and enhancing digital and data analytics capabilities to attract price-sensitive consumers.', 'Digitization Is the Key to Growth: With the change in consumer shopping patterns, industry participants have been evolving to play dual in-store and online roles. Initiatives, such as building omnichannel, coming up with loyalty and marketing programs, enhancing the supply chain and providing faster delivery options, be it doorstep delivery, curbside pickup or buy online and pick up at the store, are worth mentioning. Simultaneously, companies are investing in renovation, improved checkouts and mobile point-of-sale capabilities to keep stores relevant. Keeping in mind consumers’ product preferences and growing inclination toward online shopping, retailers have been replenishing shelves with in-demand merchandise and ramping up investments in digitization.', 'Eye on Margins: Companies in the industry are vying for a bigger share on attributes such as price, products and speed to market. Further, the increasing dominance of e-commerce players has made the retail discount space highly competitive. This has compelled many players to strengthen their digital ecosystem and boost shipping and delivery capabilities. While these endeavors drive sales, they entail high costs. Apart from these, higher marketing, advertising and other store-related expenses might compress margins. Of late, the industry participants have been dealing with product cost inflation. However, companies have been focusing on undertaking initiatives to mitigate cost-related challenges. These include streamlining operational structures, optimizing supply networks and adopting effective pricing policies.', 'Zacks Industry Rank Indicates Bright Prospects', 'The Zacks Retail – Discount Stores industry is housed within the broader Zacks Retail – Wholesale sector.

The company used advances in cellular and molecular biology to develop two of the biotech industry’s earliest and most successful drugs, Epogen (anemia) and Neupogen (white blood cell stimulant). Amgen successfully launched two next-generation products, Aranesp and Neulasta.\xa0 Meanwhile, the acquisition of Immunex Corporation gave Amgen access to the multi-blockbuster drug, Enbrel. However, all these older drugs are facing declining sales due to biosimilar or branded competition, which is being somewhat offset by its blockbuster growth drugs like Prolia and Xgeva. Other products are Repatha, Blincyto, Vectibix, Nplate, Kyprolis, Evenity, Otezla, Aimovig, Lumakras/Lumykras, Tezspire, Tavneos, Kanjinti, Mvasi and Amgevita biosimilars.Amgen also has a promising pipeline of cancer drugs. It has one of the strongest cash positions in the biotech sector, which could be used to acquire more pipeline assets that could fuel long-term growth. Biosimilar drugs are also a key part of Amgen’s growth strategy.In October 2023, Amgen acquired Horizon Therapeutics for $27.8 billion.Epogen/Aranesp, Neupogen/Neulasta and Enbrel account for around 30% of Amgen’s product revenues in 2022. Enbrel alone accounted for 16.6% of sales. Prolia accounted for 14.6% of product sales in 2022.

Amgen also has some key pipeline assets in obesity and inflammation, which are indications that can have a large market opportunity. Several data readouts are expected in the next 12 months.

This can be attributed to a decline in big tech and a rise in yields. Investors’ enthusiasm over the Fed rate cuts also faded, reflecting concerns about the skyrocketing market after a sharp rally over the past two months.This resulted in huge demand for inverse or inverse-leveraged ETFs as these fetch outsized returns on bearish sentiments in a short span. We have highlighted five leveraged inverse ETFs that piled up handsome gains in the initial trading days of 2024. These are Direxion Daily Semiconductor Bear 3x Shares SOXS, MAX Auto Industry -3x Inverse Leveraged ETN CARD, Daily S&P 500 High Beta Bear 3X Shares HIBS, MicroSectors Gold Miners -3X Inverse Leveraged ETN GDXD and MicroSectors Travel -3x Inverse Leveraged ETN FLYD.The 10-year Treasury yields climbed to above 4%. The latest Fed minutes show that it wouldn’t cut rates as aggressively as expected for this year. This suggests an uncertain path toward interest rate cuts and reflects a growing sense that inflation is under control. There is also a rising concern about the risks that “overly restrictive” monetary policy may pose to the economy.iPhone maker Apple (AAPL) declined after Barclays downgraded the rating on the stock, citing concerns about demand for new iPhones. Semiconductor stocks also saw rough trading after Dutch semiconductor manufacturing equipment maker ASML Holdings ASML said it would restrict shipments of some technology to China at the Dutch government’s behest (read: Value ETFs Reach New 52-Week High to Start 2024).The disappointing manufacturing data also added to the chaos. The U.S. manufacturing sector slipped further into contraction during December, according to the latest PMI data from S&P Global, as output declined and the downturn in new orders gathered pace.', 'These products either create a short position or a leveraged short position in the underlying index through swaps, options, futures contracts and other financial instruments. Due to their compounding effect, investors can enjoy higher returns in a short period of time, provided the trend remains a friend.However, these funds run the risk of huge losses compared to traditional ones in fluctuating or seesawing markets. Further, their performance could vary significantly from the actual performance of the underlying index over a longer period compared to a shorter period (such as weeks or months).Direxion Daily Semiconductor Bear 3x Shares (SOXS) – Up 17.7%Direxion Daily Semiconductor Bear 3x Shares targets the semiconductor corner of the technology sector with three times inverse leveraged exposure to the NYSE Semiconductor Index.Direxion Daily Semiconductor Bear 3x Shares has amassed about $973.9 million in its asset base while charging 89 bps in fees per year.

These could be attractive for those with high-risk tolerance and who believe that the “trend is the friend” in this specific corner of the investing world.', 'Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Since taking the reins at Berkshire Hathaway in the mid-1960s, he's overseen an aggregate return of 4,384,747% in his company's Class A shares (BRK.A) as of the end of 2023. On an annualized basis, he's practically doubled the total return of the benchmark S&P 500 since becoming CEO."", ""Riding the Oracle of Omaha's coattails is a strategy that's made patient investors significantly richer over the years. The struggle is simply deciding which of Berkshire's approximately 50 different securities to buy."", 'As we open the curtain on a new year, four Warren Buffett stocks stand out as screaming buys.', ""The first phenomenal buy you'll find in the $368 billion portfolio Buffett oversees at Berkshire Hathaway is none other than payment processor Mastercard (NYSE: MA)."", ""The single biggest headwind for a cyclical juggernaut like Mastercard is the health of the U.S. and global economy. If a recession were to take shape, consumer and enterprise spending would be expected to decline. That's not particularly good news for a company that relies on growth in aggregate transactions and total payment volume."", ""However, perspective changes everything. Even though recessions are a normal part of the economic cycle, they're typically short-lived. While no recession following World War II has surpassed 18 months, the majority of expansions have endured multiple years, with two lasting a full decade. Cyclical companies like Mastercard spend very little time navigating choppy waters."", ""Mastercard's success is also a function of its lending avoidance. Though the company would likely be successful as a lender, entering the lending market would potentially expose it to loan losses during recessions. With management sticking to high-margin and predictable payment processing, Mastercard hasn't been hamstrung by economic downturns."", 'Finally, consider the opportunity that lies ahead for Mastercard. Most emerging market regions remain underbanked (e.g., Southeastern Asia, Africa, and the Middle East), while cashless transaction adoption continues to grow in developed countries. Expect Mastercard stock to climb to a fresh all-time high in 2024.', ""A second Warren Buffett stock that makes for a screaming buy in the new year is satellite-radio operator Sirius XM Holdings (NASDAQ: SIRI). Shares of Sirius XM were recently re-added to Berkshire Hathaway's portfolio following a roughly two-year absence."", ""One of the clearest advantages Sirius XM brings to the table is its legal monopoly status. Although it faces competition for listeners from terrestrial and online radio operators, there isn't another licensed satellite-radio operator. This affords the company exceptional subscription-pricing power."", ""Another reason patient investors can trust Sirius XM to deliver is its revenue diversity. Most radio operators are heavily reliant on advertising for the lion's share of their sales. The problem with advertising is that its highly cyclical. The slightest hint of trouble is often enough to convince companies to pare back their ad spending."", 'Through the first nine months of 2023, Sirius XM generated just 19% of its $6.67 billion in total sales from advertising, most of which originated from Pandora, which it acquired in 2019. Meanwhile, 77% of its revenue derived from subscriptions. During recessions, subscribers are far less likely to cancel than advertisers are to reduce their spending. Thus, Sirius XM is far better prepared to navigate a downturn than its peers.', ""Furthermore, some of the company's costs remain relatively fixed. While talent acquisition and royalty expenses are going to vary from quarter to quarter, transmission and equipment expenses don't change much, if at all. As Sirius XM adds new subscribers, its operating margin can steadily expand."", 'Media juggernaut Paramount Global (NASDAQ: PARA) is the third Warren Buffett stock that looks like an amazing buy for 2024.', ""Last year was something of a double whammy for Paramount. Rapidly rising interest rates were a clear concern for investors given Paramount's debt-heavy balance sheet. Meanwhile, advertising revenue took a dive, with many businesses anticipating a recession. Advertising accounted for nearly 40% of Paramount's legacy TV media division sales through the first nine months of 2023."", ""Thankfully, the new year brings new opportunities. Specifically, 2024 is an election year. According to advertising company GroupM, U.S. political advertising is expected to grow to nearly $16 billion in the new year. This would represent an increase of 31% from the 2020 election cycle, and it's the perfect spark for ad-driven businesses."", ""Investors should also be excited about the future growth potential of Paramount's streaming segment. Even following price hikes for Paramount+ and ad-supported tier subscriptions in June, the subscriber base for Paramount+ has continued to expand. When coupled with mindful cost-reduction efforts, Paramount's direct-to-consumer segment should deliver notably smaller losses in 2024."", ""Don't forget about Pluto TV, either. Pluto TV is the nation's leading free, ad-supported streaming service. If the U.S. economy were to dip into a recession, people could look to cut their monthly expenses by choosing a free, ad-driven service like Pluto TV."", ""Paramount's track record of profitability makes its latest swoon a buying opportunity for value seekers."", 'The fourth and final Warren Buffett stock that makes for a screaming buy in 2024 is the leading e-commerce company, Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN).', ""Most people are familiar with Amazon because of its online marketplace. Insider Intelligence estimated that Amazon would rake in nearly $0.40 of every $1 spent in U.S. online retail sales in 2022. But while a majority of the company's sales originate from its online marketplace, very little of its operating cash flow or profit come from e-commerce."", ""Three ancillary segments are the secret sauce that make Amazon tick. Leading the charge is Amazon Web Services (AWS), the world's top cloud infrastructure service provider. Enterprise cloud spending is still early in its ramp-up, which should allow AWS to enjoy sustained double-digit increases in year-over-year sales. AWS is regularly responsible for 50% to 100% of Amazon's operating income despite accounting for just one-sixth of the company's net sales."", ""Advertising services is the second key division that continues to thrive. Amazon attracts more than 2 billion users to its site on a monthly basis, which makes it a logical go-to for merchants wanting to get their product(s) or message(s) in front of motivated shoppers. Even amid a challenging climate for advertisers, Amazon hasn't had any trouble sustaining double-digit sales growth."", ""The third segment of importance for Amazon is subscription services. According to founder and former CEO Jeff Bezos, Amazon surpassed 200 million global Prime subscribers in April 2021. It's likely added even more Prime subscribers since becoming the exclusive home for Thursday Night Football."", ""Although Amazon wouldn't be considered inexpensive by traditional fundamental metrics, such as the price-to-earnings ratio, it's cheaper than it's ever been relative to its forward-year cash flow. This makes it a stellar buy as we push forward into a new year."", 'Should you invest $1,000 in Mastercard right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Mastercard, consider this:', ""The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Mastercard wasn't one of them. The 10 stocks that made the cut could produce monster returns in the coming years."", 'Stock Advisor provides investors with an easy-to-follow blueprint for success, including guidance on building a portfolio, regular updates from analysts, and two new stock picks each month.

This marked a remarkable comeback for the index, showcasing its most impressive performance since 2020. Investors were drawn to the resurgence of these tech stocks, eclipsing the allure of dividends for many during this period."", ""Despite the shifting investor preferences towards tech stocks, companies in the US remained committed to rewarding their shareholders through dividends.

Moreover, the collective sum distributed to shareholders reached an all-time high of $588.2 billion, showcasing a notable rise from the previous year's $564.6 billion.

When we think about how risky a company is, we always like to look at its use of debt, since debt overload can lead to ruin. We can see that Merck & Co., Inc. (NYSE:MRK) does use debt in its business. But should shareholders be worried about its use of debt?"", ""Generally speaking, debt only becomes a real problem when a company can't easily pay it off, either by raising capital or with its own cash flow. Ultimately, if the company can't fulfill its legal obligations to repay debt, shareholders could walk away with nothing. However, a more usual (but still expensive) situation is where a company must dilute shareholders at a cheap share price simply to get debt under control. Having said that, the most common situation is where a company manages its debt reasonably well - and to its own advantage. The first thing to do when considering how much debt a business uses is to look at its cash and debt together."", ' See our latest analysis for Merck ', 'You can click the graphic below for the historical numbers, but it shows that as of September 2023 Merck had US$34.9b of debt, an increase on US$30.4b, over one year. On the flip side, it has US$8.77b in cash leading to net debt of about US$26.1b.', 'Zooming in on the latest balance sheet data, we can see that Merck had liabilities of US$23.1b due within 12 months and liabilities of US$42.3b due beyond that. Offsetting these obligations, it had cash of US$8.77b as well as receivables valued at US$11.7b due within 12 months. So its liabilities total US$45.0b more than the combination of its cash and short-term receivables.', ""Given Merck has a humongous market capitalization of US$296.5b, it's hard to believe these liabilities pose much threat. But there are sufficient liabilities that we would certainly recommend shareholders continue to monitor the balance sheet, going forward."", ""In order to size up a company's debt relative to its earnings, we calculate its net debt divided by its earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) and its earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) divided by its interest expense (its interest cover). The advantage of this approach is that we take into account both the absolute quantum of debt (with net debt to EBITDA) and the actual interest expenses associated with that debt (with its interest cover ratio)."", ""We'd say that Merck's moderate net debt to EBITDA ratio ( being 2.0), indicates prudence when it comes to debt. And its strong interest cover of 17.6 times, makes us even more comfortable. Shareholders should be aware that Merck's EBIT was down 48% last year. If that decline continues then paying off debt will be harder than selling foie gras at a vegan convention. There's no doubt that we learn most about debt from the balance sheet. But it is future earnings, more than anything, that will determine Merck's ability to maintain a healthy balance sheet going forward. So if you want to see what the professionals think, you might find this free report on analyst profit forecasts to be interesting."", ""Finally, a business needs free cash flow to pay off debt; accounting profits just don't cut it. So we clearly need to look at whether that EBIT is leading to corresponding free cash flow. During the last three years, Merck generated free cash flow amounting to a very robust 90% of its EBIT, more than we'd expect. That positions it well to pay down debt if desirable to do so."", ""Merck's EBIT growth rate was a real negative on this analysis, although the other factors we considered were considerably better. In particular, we are dazzled with its interest cover. When we consider all the elements mentioned above, it seems to us that Merck is managing its debt quite well. But a word of caution: we think debt levels are high enough to justify ongoing monitoring. The balance sheet is clearly the area to focus on when you are analysing debt. But ultimately, every company can contain risks that exist outside of the balance sheet. For example, we've discovered 5 warning signs for Merck that you should be aware of before investing here."", ""When all is said and done, sometimes its easier to focus on companies that don't even need debt.

For the year, oil and natural gas closed down some 10% and 40%, respectively.The headlines revolved around energy infrastructure provider The Williams Companies WMB agreeing to buy natural gas storage assets worth $1.95 billion and upstream behemoth ConocoPhillips’ COP positive investment decision for its Willow project in Alaska. Developments associated with Shell SHEL, Eni E and Vital Energy VTLE also grabbed attention.Overall, it was a bearish seven-day period for the sector. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures edged down around 0.2% to close at $71.65 per barrel, while natural gas prices fell 3.7% to end at $2.514 per million British thermal units (MMBtu).The crude price action turned negative on continued demand concerns as record-high domestic production added to the supply glut.Natural gas also dropped after rising the previous week, overwhelmed by high production and insipid weather-related demand.', ""1.\xa0\xa0 \xa0Energy pipeline operator The Williams Companies declared its agreement to acquire a portfolio of natural gas storage assets from an affiliate of Hartree Partners LP, a merchant commodities firm, for $1.95 billion. This strategic move is poised to reshape Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) WMB’s position in the market and establish a strong foothold in the rapidly evolving energy landscape.You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.The acquisition encompasses six underground natural gas storage facilities situated in Louisiana and Mississippi. These facilities boast a collective capacity of 115 billion cubic feet (Bcf), making them a substantial addition to WMB’s asset portfolio. Additionally, the transaction includes 230 miles of gas transmission pipeline and 30 pipeline interconnects strategically positioned to tap into lucrative markets, including Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG) markets.The acquisition price, at an approximate 10x estimated 2024 EBITDA multiple, highlights the significance of this deal for WMB. It reflects the company's commitment to investing in high-value assets that align with its long-term strategic goals. (Williams to Buy Gas Storage Portfolio for $1.95 Billion)2. One of the world’s largest independent oil and gas producers, ConocoPhillips has been granted financial approval for its Willow oil and gas drilling project in Alaska, with a budget of $8 billion. Following the green light, the company initiated winter construction. Residents of Alaska are now experiencing the positive outcomes of responsible energy development.Earlier this spring, ConocoPhillips received favorable court decisions and approval from the Biden administration. The company had already started the initial phases of the $8-billion project. However, the latest announcement marks the official approval for the company to proceed with the development until it reaches the stage of producing the first oil.The Willow project is positioned to be among the most productive oil fields on the North Slope. It is set to access approximately 600 million barrels of recoverable oil and has the capacity to yield up to 180,000 barrels per day. This will represent a substantial increase in North Slope production, which has declined since its peak in 1988 when it exceeded 2 million barrels per day. (ConocoPhillips to Proceed With Alaska's Willow Oil Project)3. European supermajor Shell entered into a significant five-year crude oil supply agreement with QatarEnergy, the state-owned oil and gas company. Under the agreement, Qatar is set to provide Shell with up to 18 million barrels of oil annually, marking a milestone for the Gulf state's energy industry.This long-term deal, regarded as QatarEnergy's first-ever five-year crude sales agreement, was announced after negotiations with Shell International Eastern Trading Company. The agreement encompasses the supply of both Qatar Land and Qatar Marine crude oils. The commencement of the supply is scheduled for January, setting the stage for a long-term partnership between the two energy giants.The agreement aligns with QatarEnergy's broader strategy of establishing enduring strategic business relationships and fostering cooperation within the energy industry. By securing a long-term commitment from Shell, QatarEnergy aims to enhance stability and reliability in its crude oil supply chain.

The successful injection of gas was accomplished within 12 months of the final investment decision.As an integral component of the Congo LNG project, the facility aligns with Eni’s fundamental efforts for supply diversification and is expected to fulfill the power generation requirements of the country.The Tango FLNG facility boasts a liquefaction capacity of 1 billion cubic meters per year (bcma). The Tango FLNG facility is tethered next to the Excalibur floating storage unit and employs a configuration known as split mooring. This marks the first implementation of this design in a floating LNG terminal.

The company acquired additional working interests from local operators Henry Energy LP, Moriah Henry Partners LLC and Henry Resources LLC for $55 million.Vital Energy's latest acquisition will increase its working interest in 45 wells by an average of 24%. The company anticipates a substantial boost to its estimated 2024 production by nearly 1,400 barrels of oil equivalent per day, with 57% being oil. Moreover, the deal is projected to increase Vital Energy's 2024 free cash flow by almost $20 million, contributing to the firm's deleveraging objectives.To fund the transaction, Vital Energy utilized tag-along rights associated with the Henry acquisition, allowing the purchase and financing of assets on the same terms. The company issued 627,000 shares of its common stock and 595,000 shares of its 2.0% cumulative mandatorily convertible preferred securities.

This makes the dividend yield 1.7%, which is above the industry average.', ' Check out our latest analysis for TE Connectivity ', ""A big dividend yield for a few years doesn't mean much if it can't be sustained. However, TE Connectivity's earnings easily cover the dividend. This means that most of its earnings are being retained to grow the business."", 'The next year is set to see EPS grow by 49.0%. If the dividend continues along recent trends, we estimate the payout ratio will be 28%, which is in the range that makes us comfortable with the sustainability of the dividend.', ""The company has an extended history of paying stable dividends. Since 2014, the annual payment back then was $0.84, compared to the most recent full-year payment of $2.36. This implies that the company grew its distributions at a yearly rate of about 11% over that duration. It is good to see that there has been strong dividend growth, and that there haven't been any cuts for a long time."", ""Some investors will be chomping at the bit to buy some of the company's stock based on its dividend history. Let's not jump to conclusions as things might not be as good as they appear on the surface. TE Connectivity has seen earnings per share falling at 3.7% per year over the last five years. If the company is making less over time, it naturally follows that it will also have to pay out less in dividends. Earnings are forecast to grow over the next 12 months and if that happens we could still be a little bit cautious until it becomes a pattern."", 'Overall, this is a reasonable dividend, and it being raised is an added bonus. The earnings coverage is acceptable for now, but with earnings on the decline we would definitely keep an eye on the payout ratio. Taking all of this into consideration, the dividend looks viable moving forward, but investors should be mindful that the company has pushed the boundaries of sustainability in the past and may do so again.', ""It's important to note that companies having a consistent dividend policy will generate greater investor confidence than those having an erratic one. Meanwhile, despite the importance of dividend payments, they are not the only factors our readers should know when assessing a company. Without at least some growth in earnings per share over time, the dividend will eventually come under pressure either from competition or inflation.

After all, nothing is certain in this world except death and taxes.', 'While neither concept is particularly uplifting, Intuit can make life easier for the latter. Earlier this year, Intuit made headlines when it introduced its generative AI operating system with custom-trained financial large language models. Think ChatGPT but specifically designed to help solve tax, accounting, marketing, cash flow and personal finance challenges.', 'Moving forward, Intuit should command extraordinary relevancies thanks to the burgeoning gig economy. Since gig workers (independent contractors) operate their own small business, the tax consideration is much more complicated. Intuit will see tremendous demand for its tax-oriented language model.

Still, the net narrative is that the biotech firm offers much potential. Subsequently, CRSP gained about 57% in 2023.', 'Part of the success is that CRSP is broadly related to the robotics revolution.

In this capacity, Wilder will oversee all technical, field and production operations of FOX News Media’s special events and breaking news coverage, including the 2024 presidential election.', 'In making the announcement, Ms. Scott said, ""For the past 27 years, Scott has been an integral part of the FOX News Media family. His extraordinary work has helped transform our field operations and events coverage, ensuring our platforms continue to deliver best in class coverage from around the world.""', 'Wilder added, ""I am truly honored and humbled to take on this role after developing an established Field Engineering team and look forward to enhancing our production for this year’s election coverage and beyond.""', 'A FOX News Channel (FNC) original, Wilder joined the network at its inception in 1996 as a field photographer. Since then, he has helped innovate and enhance all aspects of FNC’s breaking news and events programming, including all the network’s election coverage over nearly three decades. In his previous role as senior vice president of field production and operations, Wilder oversaw the first two Republican presidential primary debates of the 2024 cycle. The first, co-moderated by Bret Baier and Martha MacCallum in Milwaukee last August, delivered 13 million viewers and was the highest-rated non-sports telecast in cable for the year.

Additionally, in November 2023, he spearheaded Sean Hannity’s The Great Red vs. Blue State Debate: Newsom vs. DeSantis in Alpharetta, Georgia which pulled in more than 5 million viewers making it not only the highest-rated program of the night, but also out-rating the third non-Fox primary debate which took place the following week.', 'In 2022, Wilder led the network’s midterm election coverage, including several town halls and election night special programming, which was the most watched in all of television.

The one-time top growth stock ended the year down 14%, and it's still trying to find its footing as it deals with challenges on several fronts. Investors have lost confidence."", ""But are they getting it wrong? Let's see why there's so much pessimism, how PayPal is responding, and whether PayPal can still be a millionaire-maker stock."", ""PayPal's growth has slowed after soaring during the early stages of the pandemic lockdowns. Sales increased 8% in the 2023 third quarter compared with as much as 30% in some periods a few years ago, while total payment volume increased 15%. It's still the leader in digital payments, with $1.5 trillion in payment volume over the trailing 12 months and 430 million active customers. It's been struggling with pressure on the bottom line as well, and it posted a quarterly net loss in the second quarter of 2022, but that's on the mend."", ""While there isn't anything spectacularly bad that stands out, investors haven't been impressed with PayPal's trajectory. It's facing new competition in the exploding industry of fintech, and it hasn't been as innovative or agile as some newer, smaller companies. In general, being the market leader is an advantage, but the danger is losing focus and not keeping up."", ""PayPal has gotten so big and its services are so far-reaching that it doesn't appear to have a clear direction. To generate higher growth and investor optimism, it needs a more distinct identity. On top of that, when companies get really big, they're usually reliable for high net income. PayPal has to return to that for the stock to rise."", ""But you shouldn't count PayPal out yet. It has the upper hand with its dominant platform, and it's committed to change. Chief Executive Officer Alex Chriss took over toward the end of 2023, and he's on board to figure out PayPal's next steps. And there are plenty of ways to go."", ""One thing to keep in mind is that e-commerce is a growing industry and is forecast to outpace overall retail growth over the next few years. PayPal has a place in physical retail as well, but e-commerce is its sweet spot, and as it expands, that's a natural external tailwind."", 'On top of that, many retailers are reporting that inflation is moderating, and that should lead to organic sales growth in the near term.', ""In terms of using its resources, PayPal has already identified that it's more cost efficient to focus on active customers than total member count. Membership has decreased as the company changes course, but transactions per active customer have increased."", ""Something that I've pointed out before and keep coming back to is that historically PayPal's stock price correlated well with its net income until the quarterly loss in 2022. But while net income is rebounding, the stock price hasn't followed suit."", 'That looks like an opportunity for investors, because as investor sentiment improves, the stock price should rise and once again correlate more closely with earnings.', 'PayPal stock is likely to bounce back, and it should reward shareholders over many years. Some of the biggest stocks today, including Apple and Amazon, lost large percentages of their value several times on their way to more than $1 trillion in market cap.', ""But can PayPal stock make you millionaire? Right now, it's looking more like a value stock than a growth stock, and it doesn't even pay a dividend. But the stock could easily rise on improvements and more favorable investor sentiment. Over time, it offers serious potential for gains."", 'Right now, PayPal stock trades at a dirt-cheap price-to-earnings ratio (P/E) of only 17.5. Management has forecast earnings per share (EPS) to increase from $2.09 in 2022 to $3.75 in 2023, or an 80% increase. Keeping the P/E constant, an 80% increase in EPS should lead to an 80% increase in share price. If the P/E increases, which would be likely as investors feel more confident about the stock, the price could rise further.', 'Can PayPal deliver huge gains in 2024? Yes. If you invest enough money and wait enough time, PayPal could be a component of a millionaire-maker stock portfolio.', 'Should you invest $1,000 in PayPal right now?', 'Before you buy stock in PayPal, consider this:', ""The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and PayPal wasn't one of them.

What I told Alex is you have a great platform now, there's a lot of things to build on, but that he should be bold in his own way. Make decisions not necessarily continue with the things that I've done because that's the beauty of bringing in new leaders. And I-- kind of when I told the board that I wanted to retire, part of what I told them is like I've been doing this for almost a decade, it's time to bring in new leadership, to bring in new ideas, new thoughts."", 'And I think it\'s always difficult to say goodbye to something. Your identity is tied up in it, you know, but there\'s this Buddhist saying that goes something like, ""if you have the courage to say goodbye, 100 hellos will await you.""

I would say that Dan has really gone through some pretty tough hurdles anywhere from a prolonged headwinds from transitioning away from eBay to having to go through a normalization phase of e-commerce growth from very high pre-pandemic levels. And you know what, he did build a hell of a company that has a very strong two-sided platform, one servicing merchants. It's very sticky. And then the other one servicing roughly about 400 consumers, 400 million consumers. And that's also relatively sticky."", ""I'm just going to end this what I have to say with one sentence.

And this is really the challenge for the incoming CEO, building a very robust value-added services on both sides of the platform."", ""JOSH LIPTON: Paul, I want to bring you in here as well. And Moshe talked about the new CEO there. And there's a new man in charge, Alex Chriss, comes over from Intuit, Paul. And he's outlined some of his priorities. Already, he talks about customer experience. He talks about margin expansion, Paul. I just want to know, do you think he's outlining the right priorities in your opinion?"", '- Well, as you mentioned, the three key priorities that we highlighted from the prior earnings call were investing in the consumer experience, growing margin particularly around the unbranded Braintree product and transaction margin, and also emphasizing the SMB, the Small and Medium Business cohort, particularly through PPCP, the PayPal Complete Payments Platform, which is tailored to SMBs.', ""PAUL GOLDING: In terms of those priorities, we talk about this in our research, the user interface and customer experience, Dan Schulman invested in this over the course of his tenure. So we'll be curious to see what Alex Chriss comes in and does that reinvigorates this relative to what we've seen prior and what has been done consistently."", 'On transaction margin as was discussed prior in the segment, as unbranded volumes continue to outpace branded, this transaction margin headwind continues to be a tough hurdle to overcome in terms of seeing transaction margin momentum go to the upside and see expansion. So the volumes are good. But the transaction margin does see pressure from that.', ""And then lastly on the SMB front, we've seen SMB platforms focus on this cohort. We cover Block. Block has historically been very SMB focused. So this isn't necessarily revolutionary in our view as we've seen other platforms go after this cohort on software and services sell-through as well. So it'll be interesting to see how PayPal leverages its scale and recognition in the marketplace to maybe do more with these themes that have been worked through already to some extent."", 'JULIE HYMAN: And so, Moshe, are you confident that Alex Chriss can overcome some of those transaction fee challenges? Are you optimistic about his leadership now at PayPal?', ""MOSHE KATRI: And this is where his background could be pretty instrumental, given what he's done in his past life on the SMB space. So that's number one. And given the fact that you really have to build or rebuild an ecosystem of products and services servicing-- facing both the merchant side of the business and the consumers, and if he's able to do that, I think you you're going to have a pretty stable business that has a sticky model on both sides. And you should be able to, at least hypothetically, given the fact that you will be relying less on transaction volumes, you should be able to address the margin compression issue that they've had for about a year and a half now."", ""JOSH LIPTON: And, Paul, I also want to talk about competition in this space, because, obviously, PayPal has a lot of it. It's everyone from Apple to Shopify. What are-- in that fight, Paul, what are Paypal's competitive advantages as you see it?"", ""PAUL GOLDING: Well, scale, the most recently reported 428 million actives. And they've got about 35 million merchant accounts, which is substantial scale relative to the competition. They also have something that while others have this as well, they don't necessarily have it at the same scale that PayPal has, which is a merchant side of the house and a consumer side of the house. And to marry those ecosystems as they have done for quite some time and continue to do with various discovery tools that merge those ecosystems and allow for retargeting and promotion, that all helps drive this ecosystem flywheel that can drive margin, drive inflows, and help boost their overall margin profile."", ""JULIE HYMAN: And, guys, before we go, I want to ask you both what your top picks in the sector are. We've been focusing on PayPal, obviously, with a little bit of talk about Block also. So, Moshe, I'll start with you. What's your top pick?"", ""PAUL GOLDING: I'll give it to you in a second. I just want to add one more thing in terms of what's also unique for Paypal's merchants business, which is a conversion rate. Paypal's merchant platform is very stable and very sticky, given the fact that merchants that actually use the PayPal button have very high conversion rates. And that's why it's been so sticky."", ""We've been in general pretty defensive on the space. And for example, we like the networks, we like Visa. And then we also like some of the more legacy merchant processors. I would include their Pfizer, Global Payments, and then the last one is PayPal."", 'JULIE HYMAN: And what about you, Paul?', ""MOSHE KATRI: We're outperform on the space as well. We like the networks as well.

I had no idea the number of death threats that I would get as a result of that and hate email.""', '""My view is that our platform should be a platform where you can have civil discourse, where you can raise money for organizations that don\'t advocate violence or extreme hatred,” continued Schulman. “You would think there wouldn\'t be much controversy of taking down neo-Nazi sites or KKK sites, but there always are.""', 'As they say in life, nothing is perfect. And even Schulman had a few bumps in the road retiring from PayPal.', ""Today, PayPal's market cap stands around $65 billion, amid slower growth and rising competition from newer entrants such as Robinhood (HOOD), Affirm (AFRM), and Coinbase (COIN), and legacy payment brands like his former employer Amex and Mastercard (MA)."", 'Apple (AAPL) and Google (GOOGL) have also made strong inroads into the payments industry with offerings of their own.', ""Towards the end of Schulman's tenure, PayPal was attacked by famed activist investor Elliott Management in the summer of 2022.

It also uncorked a $15 billion stock buyback plan.', 'With that situation done and dusted, Schulman and the board got to work on picking his successor.', ""By December 2023, Schulman left PayPal's board, with the ship firmly in the hands of Chriss, who's been in the trenches outlining his plans for the company Schulman took public."", 'As for what\'s next, Schulman hints he has a lot of well-earned options — including ""senior"" government roles — being offered.

But you need to focus on your employees. That's always been kind of the centerpiece of what I've tried to do as a leader."", ""And so my view is if you wanna attract the very best employees-- and the very best employees are the bedrock of any company's success-- you have to stand for something.

One way or the other, you need to be humble."", ""Number two is to be generous, to always think the best of people, to always feel like people have best intent possible.

Krishna had previously headed IBM's cloud and cognitive software division and persuaded the previous CEO, Ginni Rometty, to approve the $34 billion acquisition of open-source software specialist Red Hat the previous year."", ""Almost four years after Krishna's tenure began, IBM has transformed itself into a cloud company. The question is, how much has that benefited its shareholders?"", 'If you bought $10,000 in stock on the day Krishna took over IBM and reinvested any dividends paid out over that time, you would have roughly $19,720 today. The stock itself would be worth just over $16,000, with dividend income accounting for the remainder.', ""An investment in the S&P 500 over the same timespan would have generated a total return of around $20,500, so IBM slightly lagged the index. Nonetheless, Krishna's leadership appears to have helped reverse a long-term downtrend in IBM stock that was going on before he took over. The stock had lost more than half of its value between 2013 and the beginning of the pandemic in 2020. IBM's longtime shareholders were likely pleased."", ""Interestingly, Krishna's move to buy Red Hat before he became CEO was likely the defining move of his tenure. To make that purchase, IBM had to take on about $23 billion in new debt, taking the total debt to around $73 billion. At the time, IBM claimed less than $18 billion in equity, so a failure to turn things around could have led to doubts about IBM's future."", ""Instead, the move appears to have been largely successful, as IBM is now among the leaders in the hybrid cloud market, an ecosystem allowing public and private clouds to interact seamlessly. Krishna followed this by acquiring numerous smaller cloud companies to draw a more extensive knowledge base under IBM's umbrella. Today, it is the fifth largest cloud provider."", 'Krishna also spun off the managed infrastructure business into a separate business called Kyndryl. This has allowed IBM to unload a slower growth segment and offer a greater focus to that industry.', ""Admittedly, both bulls and bears will find something to like in IBM's financials. The aforementioned $73 billion in total debt that IBM held as it closed the Red Hat deal has fallen to just over $55 billion as of the end of the third quarter of 2023, reducing strain on the balance sheet."", ""Additionally, Krishna has maintained IBM's streak of rising dividends. In 2023, IBM approved its 28th consecutive annual payout hike. The payout of $6.64 per share annually offers a dividend yield of just over 4%, nearly triple the S&P 500 average of about 1.5%. Since the company forecasts $10.5 billion in free cash flow for 2023, it easily covers yearly dividend costs of just over $6 billion."", 'The challenge IBM continues to have is revenue growth. It brought in more than $44 billion in revenue in the first nine months of 2023, rising by just over 1%. This lags behind peers like Amazon and Microsoft.', 'Still, it improved income from non-core functions such as currency exchange and interest income. This enabled IBM to earn $4.2 billion in net income in the first three quarters of the year. That stands in contrast to the same timeframe in 2022 when the costs of the Kyndryl spinoff and other factors led to a net loss.', ""Ultimately, IBM shareholders have benefited from Krishna's leadership. While the total return fell just short of the S&P 500, it improved considerably from the last decade, when IBM shares lost value."", ""The defining move was Krishna's role in buying Red Hat, which helped make IBM a force in the cloud industry. The Kyndryl spinoff has also fostered the company's transformation, allowing more of a focus on cloud growth."", ""With such successes, the company can still afford to keep its generous payout, making it the dividend stock of the cloud. That eventually may lead to IBM outperforming the S&P 500 during Krishna's tenure."", 'Should you invest $1,000 in International Business Machines right now?', 'Before you buy stock in International Business Machines, consider this:', ""The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and International Business Machines wasn't one of them.

GM lost tax credits for its Chevy Blazer EV, Cadillac LYRIQ, upcoming Equinox EV, and Silverado EV, but retained them for the Bolt EV and Bolt EUV. GM said Wednesday, however, that it would be offering $7,500 incentives for those cars to boost sales while the EVs are ineligible for the tax credit.', 'Rivian, which earlier this week topped its 2023 production forecast with 57,000 vehicles produced, retains the half credit of $3,500 for its R1T pickup and R1S SUV. Rivian’s vehicles start at $73,000 and $78,000, respectively, just under the $80,000 MSRP limit.', ""This brings us to Tesla, which lost eligibility for its Model 3 RWD base sedan and Model 3 long-range (AWD). According to the DOE's fuel economy website, Tesla’s Model 3 Performance edition still qualifies for the full EV tax credit. Tesla’s higher-end Model X Long Range SUV, as well as three variants of the Model Y SUV (RWD, AWD, and Performance), also qualify for the full tax credit. Tesla’s Model S sedan did not qualify before or after the change due to the fact that it cost above $55K."", 'The Cybertruck is an interesting omission because it uses batteries built at Giga Austin, which likely makes it eligible for the tax credit. The Cybertruck also has trim levels that fall under the MSRP limits. Tesla did say on its website that the Cybertruck is ""likely to qualify for the federal tax credit later in 2024.""', 'So the initial list of 13 eligible vehicles may expand to 14 or more as other automakers like GM and Ford work to source more battery components from the US and its trade partners.', 'Pras Subramanian is a reporter for Yahoo Finance.

AI’s impact in healthcare sectors should compound at 37% annually, hitting $187.95 billion by 2023 compared to just $15.1 billion last year. Even if the specific figures don’t pan out, AI’s impact on emerging healthcare trends will undeniably impact investor opportunities and patient outcomes.', 'InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips', 'In July, scientists used AI to rapidly and accurately map a fruit fly’s brain. This points to rapid potential gains within neuroscience, as intimately understanding how human brains function—in healthy and unhealthy states—will generate insight into treating degenerative diseases like Alzheimer’s and more. At the same time, companies like Recursion Pharmaceuticals (NASDAQ:RXRX) leverage AI to accelerate drug discovery processes by rapidly matching gene/therapy combinations to determine the best fit. While this platform, in which Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) has a substantial stake, will benefit shareholders, the true beneficiary is the legion of biotech firms who will now cut R&D costs and time to a fraction of where they are today.', 'Source: Rido / Shutterstock', 'Next year marks two important milestones with massive ramifications on the healthcare sector forecast for 2024 and beyond. First, we’re hitting Peak 65—the point at which more Americans simultaneously cross over into the traditional retirement age window than ever before. At the same time, we’re transitioning into the Historical Reversal, where those 65+ outnumber children 15 years and younger. Both trends point to an undeniable factor in America’s long-term future, but also short-term healthcare impacts.', 'As medical advancements improve longevity, expect to see the 65+ population swell further as upper age limit ceilings keep moving higher. Though living longer, they’ll still face elderly quality-of-life concerns that keep cash flowing into key healthcare sectors (think mobility, nutrition management and similar old-age medical concerns).', 'This means that healthcare facilities and long-term care management sectors within healthcare will continue climbing. Look to REITs to best capitalize on this trend, such as CareTrust REIT (NYSE:CTRE). However, there is some risk with relying on skilled nursing and care facilities alone. If the situation becomes financially untenable nationally, legislation may step in to bring costs down and cut into those REITs’ bottom line. In that case, look to companies like HealthPeak Properties (NYSE:PEAK), who ditched its slate of old-age facilities in favor of pricier private-pay care properties.', 'Source: shutterstock.com/MAD.vertise', 'Just as AI pushes some healthcare sectors rapidly into the future, so are robotics and healthcare automation.

These stores specialize in offering a wide range of merchandise, including groceries, household items, apparel, electronics, cleaning products, pet supplies and more, at discounted prices compared to traditional retail outlets. Discount stores operate on a low-cost business model, focusing on cost-efficient operations, bulk purchasing and streamlined supply chains to offer competitive pricing.

Consumer spending, a key catalyst for the economy, has shown resilience despite a tough economic environment. Retail sales in November rose 0.3% sequentially and 4.1% year over year. The backdrop of healthy employment and wage gains has so far bolstered consumer spending. Anticipating a potential interest rate cut by the Federal Reserve in 2024, especially if inflation continues its downward trend, there is an expectation of a further boost to consumer spending. The industry's impressive performance underscores its ability to adapt and thrive in the dynamic market conditions. Consumer confidence has been a driving force behind the sector's success.

Further, the increasing dominance of e-commerce players has made the retail discount space highly competitive. This has compelled many players to strengthen their digital ecosystem and boost shipping and delivery capabilities. While these endeavors drive sales, they entail high costs. Apart from these, higher marketing, advertising and other store-related expenses might compress margins. Of late, the industry participants have been dealing with product cost inflation.

Companies like PayPal (PYPL), however, had trouble adjusting to post-pandemic consumer behavior despite the market rally in 2023.', 'Still, some analysts maintain that while the company has been going through a growth slowdown in the last two years, now is a good time to buy in.', 'Wedbush Securities Managing Director Moshe Katri and Macquarie Capital Senior Equity Research Analyst Paul Golding join Yahoo Finance Live to talk all things fintech in the new year.', '“What PayPal has gone through in the past year and a half is really a symptom of pretty much every single fintech company in this universe,” Katri said. “You cannot exclusively rely on transaction fees in terms of revenue generation. You have to do more than that.”', 'The challenge for new PayPal CEO Alex Chriss is to build a robust line of services for both merchants and consumers on the platform, Katri maintains.', 'Along with reinvesting in consumer experience, Golding said that he is interested to see how new leadership is going to expand the platform among small and medium-sized businesses and growing the margins around businesses such as BrainTree.', 'To see the full Lead This Way episode: Dan Schulman: The CEO who made PayPal a household name, click here.', ""JULIE HYMAN: And that new chapter is already underway for PayPal with new leader Alex Chriss at the helm as of September.

With more on the path ahead for the payment giant, let's turn now to Wedbush Securities Managing director, Moshe Katri, along with Paul Golding, Macquarie Capital senior equity research analyst."", 'And, Moshe, I want to start with you because, before we look forward, I want to look back a little bit, because Dan Schulman, you know, built the company for a long time into what it is now and what it could potentially become. What do you see as his legacy, especially given that the end of his tenure was-- did see a decline in the shares?', 'MOSHE KATRI: Well, happy new year.', 'JULIE HYMAN: And to you.', ""MOSHE KATRI: So a couple of things. I would say that Dan has really gone through some pretty tough hurdles anywhere from a prolonged headwinds from transitioning away from eBay to having to go through a normalization phase of e-commerce growth from very high pre-pandemic levels. And you know what, he did build a hell of a company that has a very strong two-sided platform, one servicing merchants. It's very sticky. And then the other one servicing roughly about 400 consumers, 400 million consumers. And that's also relatively sticky."", ""I'm just going to end this what I have to say with one sentence. And I think it's really important here. What Paypal's gone through in the past year and a half is really a symptom of pretty much every single fintech company in this universe. You cannot exclusively rely on transaction fees in terms of revenue generation. You have to do more than that. And this is really the challenge for the incoming CEO, building a very robust value-added services on both sides of the platform."", ""JOSH LIPTON: Paul, I want to bring you in here as well. And Moshe talked about the new CEO there. And there's a new man in charge, Alex Chriss, comes over from Intuit, Paul. And he's outlined some of his priorities. Already, he talks about customer experience. He talks about margin expansion, Paul. I just want to know, do you think he's outlining the right priorities in your opinion?"", '- Well, as you mentioned, the three key priorities that we highlighted from the prior earnings call were investing in the consumer experience, growing margin particularly around the unbranded Braintree product and transaction margin, and also emphasizing the SMB, the Small and Medium Business cohort, particularly through PPCP, the PayPal Complete Payments Platform, which is tailored to SMBs.', ""PAUL GOLDING: In terms of those priorities, we talk about this in our research, the user interface and customer experience, Dan Schulman invested in this over the course of his tenure. So we'll be curious to see what Alex Chriss comes in and does that reinvigorates this relative to what we've seen prior and what has been done consistently."", 'On transaction margin as was discussed prior in the segment, as unbranded volumes continue to outpace branded, this transaction margin headwind continues to be a tough hurdle to overcome in terms of seeing transaction margin momentum go to the upside and see expansion. So the volumes are good. But the transaction margin does see pressure from that.', ""And then lastly on the SMB front, we've seen SMB platforms focus on this cohort. We cover Block. Block has historically been very SMB focused. So this isn't necessarily revolutionary in our view as we've seen other platforms go after this cohort on software and services sell-through as well. So it'll be interesting to see how PayPal leverages its scale and recognition in the marketplace to maybe do more with these themes that have been worked through already to some extent."", 'JULIE HYMAN: And so, Moshe, are you confident that Alex Chriss can overcome some of those transaction fee challenges? Are you optimistic about his leadership now at PayPal?', ""MOSHE KATRI: And this is where his background could be pretty instrumental, given what he's done in his past life on the SMB space. So that's number one. And given the fact that you really have to build or rebuild an ecosystem of products and services servicing-- facing both the merchant side of the business and the consumers, and if he's able to do that, I think you you're going to have a pretty stable business that has a sticky model on both sides. And you should be able to, at least hypothetically, given the fact that you will be relying less on transaction volumes, you should be able to address the margin compression issue that they've had for about a year and a half now."", ""JOSH LIPTON: And, Paul, I also want to talk about competition in this space, because, obviously, PayPal has a lot of it. It's everyone from Apple to Shopify. What are-- in that fight, Paul, what are Paypal's competitive advantages as you see it?"", ""PAUL GOLDING: Well, scale, the most recently reported 428 million actives. And they've got about 35 million merchant accounts, which is substantial scale relative to the competition. They also have something that while others have this as well, they don't necessarily have it at the same scale that PayPal has, which is a merchant side of the house and a consumer side of the house. And to marry those ecosystems as they have done for quite some time and continue to do with various discovery tools that merge those ecosystems and allow for retargeting and promotion, that all helps drive this ecosystem flywheel that can drive margin, drive inflows, and help boost their overall margin profile."", ""JULIE HYMAN: And, guys, before we go, I want to ask you both what your top picks in the sector are. We've been focusing on PayPal, obviously, with a little bit of talk about Block also. So, Moshe, I'll start with you. What's your top pick?"", ""PAUL GOLDING: I'll give it to you in a second. I just want to add one more thing in terms of what's also unique for Paypal's merchants business, which is a conversion rate. Paypal's merchant platform is very stable and very sticky, given the fact that merchants that actually use the PayPal button have very high conversion rates. And that's why it's been so sticky."", ""We've been in general pretty defensive on the space. And for example, we like the networks, we like Visa. And then we also like some of the more legacy merchant processors. I would include their Pfizer, Global Payments, and then the last one is PayPal."", 'JULIE HYMAN: And what about you, Paul?', ""MOSHE KATRI: We're outperform on the space as well. We like the networks as well. But top pick, Block probably at this point, just given the inflection point here on cost-outs and what we might see in terms of overall trajectory of that margin expansion potential relative to a more mature platform like PayPal."", 'JOSH LIPTON: All right. Moshe, Paul, thank you, guys, both for joining today. Appreciate the time and the insight there.', 'PAUL GOLDING: Thanks.']"

But then I realized — after years of taking bold stances on hot button social issues and dealing with complex business matters, Schulman finally has a few extra minutes in his week."", ""His last official day as PayPal's CEO was Sept. 26, 2023, almost nine years after the then top exec at American Express (AXP) took the top gig.

Active accounts have gone from 179 million to roughly 430 million during that same stretch."", ""Schulman disciples — aka PayPal leaders — have gone on to major C-suite roles elsewhere, such as Walmart's (WMT) CFO John David Rainey (former PayPal CFO) and Pinterest (PINS) CEO Bill Ready (former PayPal COO)."", ""As PayPal's profile rose, so did Schulman's, spurring him to tackle social issues he thought should be addressed by a prominent leader that isn't afraid to speak out."", 'None was more headline-grabbing than the decision to cancel plans to open a global operations center in Charlotte, N.C., after lawmakers passed a controversial law targeting LGBT people in 2016.', '""The new law perpetuates discrimination and it violates the values and principles that are at the core of PayPal\'s mission and culture,"" Schulman said in a statement at the time.', 'Schulman concedes today that the decision to speak out came with unintended aftershocks.', '""I felt like that was anathema to our values,"" Schulman tells me. ""And so we pulled out of North Carolina. I had no idea that it would be front page news of the New York Times. I had no idea the number of death threats that I would get as a result of that and hate email.""', '""My view is that our platform should be a platform where you can have civil discourse, where you can raise money for organizations that don\'t advocate violence or extreme hatred,” continued Schulman. “You would think there wouldn\'t be much controversy of taking down neo-Nazi sites or KKK sites, but there always are.""', 'As they say in life, nothing is perfect. And even Schulman had a few bumps in the road retiring from PayPal.', ""Today, PayPal's market cap stands around $65 billion, amid slower growth and rising competition from newer entrants such as Robinhood (HOOD), Affirm (AFRM), and Coinbase (COIN), and legacy payment brands like his former employer Amex and Mastercard (MA)."", 'Apple (AAPL) and Google (GOOGL) have also made strong inroads into the payments industry with offerings of their own.', ""Towards the end of Schulman's tenure, PayPal was attacked by famed activist investor Elliott Management in the summer of 2022.

While I understand these concerns, I think they are short-sighted. Long-term investors in Rithm stock have enjoyed a total return of more than 140% during the past decade. Given the company's diversified roster of services, coupled with a unique opportunity to take advantage of disparities in the marketplace given current credit underwriting policies at banks, I think Rithm is set up to continue its robust performance."", ""The second company I'm exploring is tobacco giant Altria (NYSE: MO). Indeed, demand for tobacco products has been on the decline for many years as consumers become more health conscious. Moreover, current macroeconomic conditions, hallmarked by high borrowing costs and inflation, have caused consumer spending to drop in certain areas. Altria has not been immune to these trends, and its financial profile reflects that."", ""Nevertheless, as the best companies often do, Altria has found ways to combat the shrinking popularity of traditional tobacco products. More specifically, the company is making inroads in the smokeless tobacco and vaping markets as it looks to diversify its product offerings. While time will tell if these investments will pay off, current investors may want to take advantage of the company's depressed share price."", ""Altria stock currently trades at a forward price-to-earnings (P/E) multiple of 8.3, far below the S&P 500's 21.7. It sure looks like investors have soured on Altria and do not expect much from the company. But perhaps what makes Altria the most unique company on this list is its esteemed position among the Dividend Kings, or companies that have raised their dividends for 50 consecutive years or more."", 'Long-term investors should zoom out and think about the entire picture here. While tobacco products are falling out of favor, Altria has faced its share of uphill battles throughout its long history and has always found ways to reward loyal shareholders.', 'Given its 9.5% yield, one-fourth of the proposed $125,000 investment could generate more than $2,900 of dividend income for your portfolio. Investors may want to seriously consider a position in Altria at its current valuation, all while reaping passive income from a company that has consistently raised its dividend.', ""Coming in at No. 3 is telecommunications provider Verizon Communications (NYSE: VZ). I'll admit, the telecommunications sector isn't the most glamorous. The products and services offered by these companies are generally commoditized, thus forcing major players to compete on price. Moreover, as streaming services gain momentum, companies like Verizon are constantly battling subscriber churn. It shouldn't come as a surprise that Verizon stock has fallen about 3% during the past year."", 'Yet despite a challenging competitive landscape, Verizon still manages to generate robust free cash flow. In turn, the company has the financial flexibility to consistently reward shareholders. In fact, back in September, the company raised its dividend for the 17th consecutive year. I think these dynamics are discounted by investors who are seeking more lucrative growth prospects.', 'So, while Verizon stock is likely not going to handily outperform the broader markets, dividend investors still might like the stock. At a 6.8% yield, one-fourth of the proposed $125,000 investment could bring in more than $2,100 of dividend income.', 'The last company on the list is Verizon competitor AT&T (NYSE: T). What makes AT&T a bit more attractive is the fact that it is actually increasing revenue, unlike Verizon.', ""Moreover, AT&T's strong cash flow generation has allowed the company to clean up its balance sheet and pay off debt. By improving its liquidity profile, you might think that the company is earning cheers from Wall Street. But this isn't the case."", ""Back in 2022, AT&T cut its dividend by roughly half. Naturally, investors soured and likely started doubting AT&T's ability to manage the business efficiently. As of the time of this article, AT&T stock is trading near some of its lowest levels in three decades."", ""While it's understandable for investors to question management's operating capabilities after such a drastic move as cutting the dividend, I see the current price action in the stock as a buying opportunity. Given the company's improving net debt position, I think the dividend is relatively safe. At a 6.4% yield, the final one-fourth of the proposed $125,000 investment would produce $2,000 of dividend income, bringing the total amount of passive income to $10,000."", 'Should you invest $1,000 in Rithm Capital right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Rithm Capital, consider this:', ""The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Rithm Capital wasn't one of them.

You can skip our detailed analysis of dividend stocks and their performance over the years, and go directly to read 5 Best January Dividend Stocks To Buy.\xa0', ""During 2023, dividends didn't hold much appeal for investors as compared to previous times. Instead, the spotlight returned to the renowned tech stocks that had underperformed the year before. The Nasdaq index, which leans heavily towards tech companies, stole the show by delivering exceptional results, surging by 43% throughout the year. This marked a remarkable comeback for the index, showcasing its most impressive performance since 2020. Investors were drawn to the resurgence of these tech stocks, eclipsing the allure of dividends for many during this period."", ""Despite the shifting investor preferences towards tech stocks, companies in the US remained committed to rewarding their shareholders through dividends. As per a report from S&P Dow Jones Indices, in 2023, the S&P 500 companies didn't hold back when it came to dividends, setting a new milestone by paying an annual record of $70.30 per share to their investors. This marked a significant increase from the previous year's figure of $66.92 per share. Moreover, the collective sum distributed to shareholders reached an all-time high of $588.2 billion, showcasing a notable rise from the previous year's $564.6 billion. This commitment to distributing dividends illustrates the ongoing dedication of US companies to share profits and value with their shareholders, despite the fluctuating trends in investor preferences. The report also mentioned that in the fourth quarter of 2023, companies took a notably careful stance regarding their dividend payments. That said, analysts are positive about dividend stocks in 2024."", 'Howard Silverblatt, Senior Index Analyst at S&P Dow Jones Indices, expressed his perspective on this matter within the S&P report. Here are some of his comments:', '“For 2024, the dollar aggregate of dividends is expected to increase once again. Absent an economic or geopolitical event, S&P 500 large caps appear to be weathering volatility better, as the index is expected to post its 15th consecutive year of dividend increases. In addition, the index is also expected to log its 13th consecutive record year, with a 4.5% - 5% increase in payments for 2024, compared to its 5.1% increase in 2023 and its 10.8% increase in 2022.”', 'Dividends have consistently held a significant place within the realm of stock market returns. In his book ""The Future for Investors,"" Jeremy Siegel emphasized the substantial impact of reinvesting dividends on total stock accumulation. He highlighted that 97% of the actual accumulation from stocks stems from the continuous reinvestment of dividends, while only 3% results from capital gains. This underscores the long-term benefits of dividends in building wealth through investments. For this reason, investors focus on companies that consistently grow their dividends. Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT), Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ), and AbbVie Inc. (NYSE:ABBV) are some of the best dividend stocks that have consistently increased their dividend payouts for several decades, earning them a revered status among investors.', 'Investing in dividend stocks involves a deeper level of analysis and understanding. While dividends are commonly associated with long-term gains, some investors pursue short-term profits through a tactic called dividend capture. This strategy revolves around taking advantage of dividend payments from a stock. Essentially, investors employing this method aim to purchase shares of a company right before it issues its dividend and then sell those shares shortly after receiving the dividend payout. To know more about this strategy, have a look at our article Dividend Capture Strategy: 10 High Yield Stocks To Buy in November.

It has lost to the market for three consecutive years. Shares of Home Depot (NYSE: HD) also fell just short of the market's return in 2023, as sales slumped in a problematic real estate market. Verizon (NYSE: VZ) fared even worse. It's the one stock on this list that actually declined last year if you back out the telco's chunky dividend."", ""All three stocks are members of the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJINDICES: ^DJI), a problem since the index itself failed to keep pace with the larger and more widely followed S&P 500 in 2023. Things should get better for Disney, Home Depot, and Verizon this year. Let's see why these are three stocks set to take off in 2024 and beyond."", ""Disney shares inching 4% higher in 2023 pales in comparison to the market's big gains last year, and it followed back-to-back years of double-digit percentage declines. The Mickey Mouse company is losing billions on Disney+. Its historically resilient theatrical releases had a disappointing year, falling short of rival Comcast's (NASDAQ: CMCSA) in total global box office receipts for the first time since 2015. Its traditional media networks business also felt a double whammy of cord-cutting and weak ad market."", ""Things should get better on most fronts for Disney this year. CEO Bob Iger continues to expect Disney's streaming operations to turn profitable by the fiscal fourth quarter, which ends in September. Disney put out fewer films than Comcast last year, explaining why it wasn't the box office leader for the first time in eight years. It also has new films in the Inside Out, Deadpool, and Lion King franchises coming out in 2024, giving it the inside track to regain its market leadership at the multiplex. Cord-cutting will continue to be a problem for its media networks, but if the TV advertising market recovers and Disney+ turns a financial corner, the media giant will be just fine."", ""The market's bracing for slow yet steady growth on Disney's top line in these next two fiscal years. The real stock story here will be the bottom line as Disney+, Hulu, and ESPN+ stop sandbagging the entertainment bellwether's income statement."", ""Analysts see Disney's earnings per share climbing 16% this fiscal year, accelerating to 20% next year. With Disney stock trading at a reasonable 17 times next year's earnings and some of the strongest intellectual properties in the business, you can't keep the House of Mouse down for long."", 'The orange aprons may have seemed like white flags last year. The only pocket of resiliency in the housing market was new construction: Developers thrived given the lack of secondhand homes hitting the market as folks were scared to swap their low mortgage rates for higher living costs in new digs.', ""Home Depot's sales have declined for all three quarters of the current fiscal year. It's not just the lack of real estate activity. Homeowners who used to bankroll makeovers through cash-out refinancing moves are on the sidelines given the stiff borrowing costs. The climate should get kinder in 2024. The growing consensus among economists is that interest rates will hold steady if not decline this year, and if that's true, all the pent-up demand for Home Depot visits that have accumulated as mortgages will come crashing in through its automatic sliding doors."", 'Like a long-standing home, this stock has good bones, with a tendency to deliver monster gains for long-term investors. Wall Street sees revenue and earnings inching higher for Home Depot in the new fiscal year, which kicks off next month. This trickle could be a gusher if the climate for housing activity improves in 2024.', ""Finally, let's answer Verizon's incoming call. Unlike its largest rival, the wireless carrier hasn't been sidetracked by costly combinations with media networks and satellite TV outfits over the years. Verizon's focus has been on telco, admittedly not a cheap business to crack with big investments in 5G technology and other infrastructure costs."", ""Verizon isn't exciting. Annual revenue growth hasn't topped 6% in 14 years. The pricing elasticity that bulls expected after two smaller rivals joined forces in 2020 or the 5G revolution has yet to materialize. However, Verizon's 6.8% yield is going to look even better in 2024 as income investors will likely see fixed income rates contract this year. Lower rates will also help tame Verizon's hefty debt exposure.

Many investors simply won't buy stocks with price tags over a certain amount."", 'Here are three stocks investors are desperate to see split in 2024. ', 'Topping my list is a software company that is jumping headfirst into the artificial intelligence (AI) pool: Adobe (NASDAQ: ADBE).', ""The company is behind iconic software products such as Adobe Photoshop, Adobe Illustrator, and Adobe Premier Pro. But it's not resting on its laurels. Adobe has quickly integrated AI-enabled features into many, if not all, of its product offerings."", 'For example, Adobe Firefly uses AI to generate high-quality images. Moreover, those images can be used commercially, thus potentially undercutting the business model of image license companies, such as Shutterstock and Getty.', ""However, investors hoping for an Adobe stock split shouldn't hold their breath. The company last split its shares back in 2005. Granted, shares are once again trading near an all-time high and tip the scales at nearly $600 per share as of this writing. Yet, a high dollar value alone isn't always enough to convince a board of directors to move forward with a stock split."", ""Although investors may be desperate for an Adobe stock split in 2024, I wouldn't count on it."", 'Next up is MercadoLibre (NASDAQ: MELI), the Latin American e-commerce giant. Needless to say, with a stock price well over $1,500, investors would love to see a stock split for MercadoLibre.', 'Even so, it may not happen. Despite having gone public more than 15 years ago, MercadoLibre has never split its shares.', 'The company, which combines e-commerce and payments processing like a Latin American fusion of Amazon and PayPal, is red-hot. ', 'In its most recent quarter (the three months ending on Sept. 30, 2023), the company reported revenue growth of 40%, with trailing-12-month revenue climbing to $13.2 billion. Better still, free cash flow grew to $84.62 per share, up from $48.88 per share one year ago.', ""In any event, investors shouldn't get their hopes up for a MercadoLibre stock split. Why? Consider this: One reason companies tend to keep their stock prices around $100 per share is so management can fine-tune employees' stock-based compensation. "", 'However, MercadoLibre has a tiny amount of stock-based compensation. In the last 12 months, it has paid only $84 million in stock-based compensation. Compare that to a company like Airbnb, which has spent over $1 billion on stock-based compensation.', 'In short, MercadoLibre lacks one of the main motivations for a company to split its stock. Therefore, the board of directors may choose to do what it has done since the company went public -- refrain from doing a stock split.', ""Finally, the stock split that many investors want to see is Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA). That's because Nvidia was the stock to own in 2023, having generated a massive 239% return."", ""What's more, the company has executed multiple stock splits dating back to 1999 -- five to be exact. The latest took place in 2021."", 'Given the massive retail investor interest in the stock, and the fact that Nvidia has split its shares around its current price point in the not-too-distant past, it stands to reason that another stock split could be on the horizon.

Indeed, it's not unrealistic to think Nvidia could surpass Amazon or Alphabet in 2024 to become the third-largest American company."", ""That said, Nvidia now stands out among the top eight largest companies as having the highest stock price. So, it's possible the board of directors may want to divide its shares to bring them back in line with fellow megacap companies like Amazon and Alphabet, whose shares trade at around $150 per share."", 'Finally, as noted earlier, companies prefer to keep share prices relatively low to fine-tune stock-based compensation. Nvidia, which paid nearly $3.3 billion in stock-based compensation over the last 12 months, certainly falls into this category.', ""Nvidia has the need, the history, and the motive to split its shares in 2024.

The sector, at least as defined by the VanEck Semiconductor ETF (NASDAQ: SMH), rocketed 73.4% in 2023! So if you had shied away from this volatile yet important part of the market, you likely missed out on some of the biggest gains of the year.', 'The artificial intelligence (AI) revolution no doubt played a big part, causing some of the largest names like Nvidia and Advanced Micro Devices to rise 239% and 128%, respectively.', 'But there are other, really important chip companies with strong business models and important long-term growth trends that lagged the sector. On that note, the following three stocks still look like bargain-priced options in the red-hot sector today.', 'SMH Year to Date Total Returns (Daily) data by YCharts.', 'The world\'s largest chip foundry Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (NYSE: TSM) was up ""only"" 42.3% in 2023, including its 1.9% dividend. But that left the stock only trading around 18 times trailing earnings and under 16 times this year\'s earnings estimates.', ""That's certainly a more-than-reasonable price to pay for the world's largest foundry that makes basically all of the world's most important chips, from Nvidia's H100 accelerators to AMD's Instinct MI300 to Apple's M-series laptop and A-series mobile processors."", ""2023 was a down year for many key semiconductor markets, including both PCs and smartphones, which are still the largest chip end markets today. Investors became disappointed in TSMC's results mid-year after second-quarter earnings when management revealed that AI chips made by Nvidia only made up a mid-single-digit percentage of the overall industry. Given how huge Nvidia's growth was last year, that appeared to surprise some investors, who may have been hoping for a bigger AI surge for TSMC."", 'But TSMC stock clawed its way back toward the end of the year when growth surprised to the upside. In its Q2 earnings call with analysts, TSMC management revised down prior guidance for the year, anticipating revenue would fall around 10% for the year.', 'However, things turned out much better than anticipated, as AI demand remained very strong while other key markets started to turn around. TSMC releases its monthly revenue, and through November, its 11-month revenue was only 4.1% below that of 2022 -- much better than the anticipated 10% decline.', ""Eventually, all of those laptops and smartphones bought during the 2020 to 2021 pandemic period will have to be replaced, likely by higher-end chips for AI PCs and other advanced machines. Furthermore, AMD's CEO Lisa Su just increased her outlook for the AI chip market to $400 billion by 2027, up from her June prediction of just $150 billion."", 'While TSMC said it expects AI chips to grow from a mid-single-digit percentage of its revenue to a mid-teens percentage over time, that is probably conservative. With a larger AI market growing very fast as other markets are turning around, look for TSMC to post strong growth in the year ahead.', 'The electric vehicle (EV) market is projected for long-term growth, especially as technology improves and costs come down. But 2023 saw a slowdown in the market, causing many EV-related stocks to plunge in Q2 and Q3, like silicon carbide leader On Semiconductor (NASDAQ: ON).', 'This year, the supply chain shortages that plagued the industry in 2021 and 2022 were alleviated, leading to ample supply. Meanwhile, higher interest rates dampened demand for EVs, which tend to be a bit pricier than the typical internal combustion engine (ICE). A late summer report showed that EV inventories were piling up at dealerships in the U.S., with some major automakers saying they would slow their battery and EV manufacturing plans.', ""Those fears appeared justified when On reported Q3 earnings, during which it guided for a soft Q4. On is currently a leader in silicon carbide power chips, a difficult-to-manufacture semiconductor alloy that is especially useful in high-power applications, like electric vehicles and infrastructure. The company blamed the slowdown on a very large European customer that had paused some orders, which isn't surprising given the news about slower adoption of certain EV models."", 'But fears that EVs have exhausted early adopters may be misplaced. After all, despite the slowdown, EVs are still growing faster than ICE cars in the U.S., Europe, and China -- just not as fast as some more bullish observers may have anticipated. And as interest rates moderate and charging infrastructure improves, customer adoption should eventually be there.', 'So near-term fears may have opened up an opportunity for longer-term investors in On. After all, the stock only trades at less than 16 times earnings. Moreover, the company is set to improve margins as it brings its new 300mm East Fishkill plant up to speed, so there is also a self-help, margin-improvement story here as well.', 'The AI revolution has put a big focus on whichever chipmaker can produce the fastest and most power-efficient chip at the most advanced node. But investors shouldn\'t ignore chip-packaging companies either, such as industry leader Kulicke and Soffa (NASDAQ: KLIC). These types of companies are somewhat less sexy and use more commoditized machines that connect chips together on a motherboard or even to each other, usually through copper wires or small copper ""bumps.""', 'But as chips become more complex, a greater focus will come on packaging. This is especially true as power and electricity concerns come to the fore, since more powerful chips require more electricity and generate more heat. AI chipmakers are even beginning to construct chips made of ""chiplets,"" which are optimized pieces of silicon stitched together, with new, advanced packaging technologies, into ""superchips."" For instance, AMD\'s MI300 is made out of 13 different chiplets.', 'Kulicke and Soffa has a dominant market position in ""legacy"" ball bonder packaging equipment, demand for which fluctuates with cycles. But it has smaller revenue segments in newer up-and-coming technologies, such as thermocompression bonding for chiplets, EV battery packaging, and microLEDs -- a new kind of advanced screen that is currently in high-end electronics but could one day eventually spread to smartphones.', ""Not unlike TSMC, Kulicke's mature business in ball bonding is in a downcycle, causing a massive decline in earnings over the past year, from $7.09 in 2022 to just $0.99 in 2023. But if those are the two extremes, one could argue Kulicke's average earnings power is around $4 per share. With the stock at just $51.50 with nearly $13.40 in cash on the balance sheet with no debt, the company's enterprise value (around $38 per share) to average earnings ($4) would be under 10."", ""That's a cheap stock no matter which way you cut it, making Kulicke and Soffa an under-the radar pick in 2024."", 'Should you invest $1,000 in Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing, consider this:', ""The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing wasn't one of them.

His extraordinary work has helped transform our field operations and events coverage, ensuring our platforms continue to deliver best in class coverage from around the world.""', 'Wilder added, ""I am truly honored and humbled to take on this role after developing an established Field Engineering team and look forward to enhancing our production for this year’s election coverage and beyond.""', 'A FOX News Channel (FNC) original, Wilder joined the network at its inception in 1996 as a field photographer. Since then, he has helped innovate and enhance all aspects of FNC’s breaking news and events programming, including all the network’s election coverage over nearly three decades. In his previous role as senior vice president of field production and operations, Wilder oversaw the first two Republican presidential primary debates of the 2024 cycle. The first, co-moderated by Bret Baier and Martha MacCallum in Milwaukee last August, delivered 13 million viewers and was the highest-rated non-sports telecast in cable for the year. In September, he oversaw the production surrounding FOX Business Network’s debate moderated by Dana Perino and Stuart Varney in Simi Valley, California, which drew nearly 10 million viewers. Additionally, in November 2023, he spearheaded Sean Hannity’s The Great Red vs. Blue State Debate: Newsom vs. DeSantis in Alpharetta, Georgia which pulled in more than 5 million viewers making it not only the highest-rated program of the night, but also out-rating the third non-Fox primary debate which took place the following week.', 'In 2022, Wilder led the network’s midterm election coverage, including several town halls and election night special programming, which was the most watched in all of television. Throughout his tenure with the network, he has overseen the production and operations for all major political events, including international presidential diplomacy trips and numerous G8 summits. He has also helped create the signature look for FOX Nation’s annual Patriot Awards, which just held its fifth celebration at The Grand Ole Opry House in Nashville. Notably he oversaw the production of Queen Elizabeth’s funeral in 2022 as well as President Biden’s inauguration in 2021 along with special live coverage of his first joint address to congress.', 'Wilder also helped engineer more than 40 remote studios across the country as the pandemic mandated a global shutdown in 2020, ensuring FOX News Media platforms continued to deliver news and information to millions of viewers nationwide. Throughout the pandemic, Wilder led all special events coverage, from the presidential campaign trail and the conventions to numerous COVID-19 related town halls, including with former President Donald Trump and his task force, to the social justice protests following the death of George Floyd and the memorial services honoring civil rights icon Rep. John Lewis and Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, all while maintaining social distancing and health safety protocols. As a result, FOX News Channel’s breaking news coverage helped deliver the highest-rated year in television history, outpacing broadcast networks for the first time in history during the third quarter of that year.', 'In addition to overseeing all of FOX News Media events coverage, Wilder has also helped innovate and advance the network’s technical and field operations units. In 2019, he was elevated to vice president of field operations where he transformed the production team, implementing a collaborative field production unit that created news-specific environments to broadcast around the world. From 2017-2019, he served as director of field and aerial operations where he helped integrate new technologies into network coverage, including innovative drone footage that was used across breaking news and live events coverage. Previously, he served as ENG field operations supervisor from 2007-2017 and prior to that was the field photographer and coordinator of ENG operations.', 'FOX News Media operates the FOX News Channel (FNC), FOX Business Network (FBN), FOX News Digital, FOX News Audio, FOX News Books, the direct-to-consumer streaming services FOX Nation and FOX News International and the free ad-supported television service FOX Weather. Currently the number one network in all of cable, FNC has also been the most watched television news channel for nearly 22 years, while FBN is the top business channel on cable.

Reutlinger had been serving as a consultant to Robinson.', 'According to a statement from Eden Prairie, Minnesota-based Robinson (NASDAQ: CHRW), the new office will be “focused on strengthening capabilities needed to further enable” the company’s strategic priorities. Reutlinger, who was named vice president, enterprise strategy program management, reports to Dave Bozeman, Robinson’s president and CEO, who assumed the top job last June.', 'The office’s launch is seen as a step in Bozeman’s implementation of a strategy to revive Robinson’s flagging fortunes. The company, the nation’s largest freight broker and a sizable 3PL, has experienced income and revenue declines for a number of quarters and has been hit hard by the deep freight recession. It did not participate strongly in the freight upturn during and after the pandemic and was caught with a bloated organizational infrastructure when freight markets turned down. It has also been criticized for not having the IT chops needed to respond to increasing digital demands from shippers and carriers.', 'Bozeman has spent much of his first six months or so learning about Robinson’s business and devising a plan to turn things around. Reutlinger’s appointment dovetails with Bozeman’s plans to apply lean process structure to Robinson’s operations. Robinson, like many in the transport sector, has not pushed aggressively into lean process management. One company that did, the old Con-Way Inc., had its lean less-than-truckload operations dismantled by XPO Inc. (NYSE: XPO) following XPO’s $3 billion purchase of Con-Way in 2015.', 'Separately, Robinson disclosed that it has agreed with activist investor Ancora, which controls about 2% of Robinson’s stock, to renominate Ancora’s two appointed board members.', '', 'In a Dec. 29 filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, Robinson agreed to renominate current Directors Henry “Jay” Winship and Henry J. Maier, provided that Ancora doesn’t nominate other individuals to the board, make any proposals or engage in any proxy solicitation ahead of Robinson’s annual stockholder meeting in May.', 'Last January, Ancora signed a one-year extension of a prior agreement from February 2022 that put two Ancora representatives on the Robinson board but with the promise that Ancora would not seek changes at the company for at least another year.', 'The post C.H. Robinson creates office to implement strategic initiatives appeared first on FreightWaves.']"

The so-called Mickey Mouse Protection Act has involved intense lobbying from Disney over the decades as it has sought to keep as much of its iconic logo out of the public domain as possible, so only the original version of Mickey that first debuted in a seven-minute animated short from 1928 can now be adapted. Later evolutions of the character, which for example added color or his signature high-pitched voice, still remain protected.', '“It’s Steamboat Willie’s Mickey Mouse murdering people,” film director Jamie Bailey said in a statement to The Hollywood Reporter, describing his concept as “ridiculous.” “We ran with it and had fun doing it, and I think it shows.”', ""And that's not even the only B-movie set to feature a knife-wielding Mickey, as another is being prepped by director\xa0Stephen LaMorte. Video game makers are also\xa0getting in on the fun\xa0with the survival horror title\xa0Infestation: Origins\xa0featuring a blood-spattered version of the signature character."", ""“Disney is going to lose millions and a valuable copyright that it’s been able to leverage on all sorts of merchandise,”\xa0warned Donald Harris, an associate dean at Temple's Beasley School of Law, in an interview with the university's news site."", 'https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I5pG1wbRKOg', 'Iger’s hands are tied since it lost exclusive copyright protection of the original character (and his love interest Minnie Mouse) now that 95 years have passed since Steamboat Willie. English author A.A. Milne’s Winnie the Pooh character, whose rights also belong to Disney, already received the low-budget slasher treatment last year.', 'The somewhat arbitrary-sounding length arose precisely because Disney repeatedly lobbied Congress to extend the protection. In 1998, then-CEO Michael Eisner flew into Washington to dine personally with the Senate majority leader. Shortly thereafter what was nicknamed the Mickey Mouse Protection Act passed both houses, resulting in the current legal limit.', 'Why horror, then? The genre lends itself ideally to the expiration of the copyright protection. Steamboat Willie’s Mickey couldn’t speak, and a silent killer bearing a mask with more grotesque features of the recognizable mouse’s visage is easier to get away with. Certain guardrails still apply under trademark law—enough at least to raise the risk of a costly lawsuit.', '“With the Winnie the Pooh horror movie, what you saw is them very much not using any visuals that were similar to things that are still under copyright, because some of the books were made later,” said Harvard professor Rebecca Tushnet in an October\xa0interview\xa0with\xa0Harvard Law Today.', 'Notably South Park was already able to portray Mickey back in 2009 as a foul-mouthed bully selling sex to underage girls with the help of Disney’s Jonas Brothers music act. But creators Trey Parker and Matt Stone were able to by rely on a legal clause allowing for what’s called “fair use,” which can include obvious parodies or political commentary.', 'https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qe85jZhSflk', 'In a statement last month to the Associated Press, Disney said it would continue to guard its rights to the more modern versions of its iconic mascot that came later. Meanwhile other household names like Donald Duck, Goofy, and Pluto remain protected—for now.', 'CEO Bob Iger is already busy putting fires out left, right, and center at Disney, however. His company offered up one commercial bomb after the other last year; he’s waging a public feud with Elon Musk, activist investor Nelson Peltz aims to usurp control; and now its Lucasfilm studio has sparked fresh controversy over Disney’s ailing Star Wars franchise.', 'A couple of low-budget slasher flicks capitalizing on the beloved mascot may be the least of his immediate worries.', 'This story was originally featured on Fortune.com']"

It has lost to the market for three consecutive years. Shares of Home Depot (NYSE: HD) also fell just short of the market's return in 2023, as sales slumped in a problematic real estate market. Verizon (NYSE: VZ) fared even worse. It's the one stock on this list that actually declined last year if you back out the telco's chunky dividend."", ""All three stocks are members of the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJINDICES: ^DJI), a problem since the index itself failed to keep pace with the larger and more widely followed S&P 500 in 2023. Things should get better for Disney, Home Depot, and Verizon this year. Let's see why these are three stocks set to take off in 2024 and beyond."", ""Disney shares inching 4% higher in 2023 pales in comparison to the market's big gains last year, and it followed back-to-back years of double-digit percentage declines. The Mickey Mouse company is losing billions on Disney+. Its historically resilient theatrical releases had a disappointing year, falling short of rival Comcast's (NASDAQ: CMCSA) in total global box office receipts for the first time since 2015. Its traditional media networks business also felt a double whammy of cord-cutting and weak ad market."", ""Things should get better on most fronts for Disney this year. CEO Bob Iger continues to expect Disney's streaming operations to turn profitable by the fiscal fourth quarter, which ends in September. Disney put out fewer films than Comcast last year, explaining why it wasn't the box office leader for the first time in eight years. It also has new films in the Inside Out, Deadpool, and Lion King franchises coming out in 2024, giving it the inside track to regain its market leadership at the multiplex. Cord-cutting will continue to be a problem for its media networks, but if the TV advertising market recovers and Disney+ turns a financial corner, the media giant will be just fine."", ""The market's bracing for slow yet steady growth on Disney's top line in these next two fiscal years. The real stock story here will be the bottom line as Disney+, Hulu, and ESPN+ stop sandbagging the entertainment bellwether's income statement."", ""Analysts see Disney's earnings per share climbing 16% this fiscal year, accelerating to 20% next year. With Disney stock trading at a reasonable 17 times next year's earnings and some of the strongest intellectual properties in the business, you can't keep the House of Mouse down for long."", 'The orange aprons may have seemed like white flags last year. The only pocket of resiliency in the housing market was new construction: Developers thrived given the lack of secondhand homes hitting the market as folks were scared to swap their low mortgage rates for higher living costs in new digs.', ""Home Depot's sales have declined for all three quarters of the current fiscal year. It's not just the lack of real estate activity. Homeowners who used to bankroll makeovers through cash-out refinancing moves are on the sidelines given the stiff borrowing costs. The climate should get kinder in 2024. The growing consensus among economists is that interest rates will hold steady if not decline this year, and if that's true, all the pent-up demand for Home Depot visits that have accumulated as mortgages will come crashing in through its automatic sliding doors."", 'Like a long-standing home, this stock has good bones, with a tendency to deliver monster gains for long-term investors. Wall Street sees revenue and earnings inching higher for Home Depot in the new fiscal year, which kicks off next month. This trickle could be a gusher if the climate for housing activity improves in 2024.', ""Finally, let's answer Verizon's incoming call. Unlike its largest rival, the wireless carrier hasn't been sidetracked by costly combinations with media networks and satellite TV outfits over the years. Verizon's focus has been on telco, admittedly not a cheap business to crack with big investments in 5G technology and other infrastructure costs."", ""Verizon isn't exciting. Annual revenue growth hasn't topped 6% in 14 years. The pricing elasticity that bulls expected after two smaller rivals joined forces in 2020 or the 5G revolution has yet to materialize. However, Verizon's 6.8% yield is going to look even better in 2024 as income investors will likely see fixed income rates contract this year. Lower rates will also help tame Verizon's hefty debt exposure. Fetching just 8 times trailing earnings, Verizon could be the right call for value investors to make in 2024."", 'Should you invest $1,000 in Walt Disney right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Walt Disney, consider this:', ""The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Walt Disney wasn't one of them.

I do think-- I think Peltz, winning in a proxy fight was a very long shot to begin with.

I mean, he's free to go buy shares and say what he wants, but he doesn't have any more power or rights than that. He can make a lot of noise in the press. It's a distraction for Disney. It's not something they necessarily want."", ""But the just say no defense can be a pretty effective one if you're willing to turn your ears off and not worry about what people are saying. And I think Disney would like this to go away, right? They've got real issues with their business that they need to deal with and not be distracted."", ""The fact that some of the people involved in this are former Disney people makes it even a little sort of stickier from a PR standpoint.

Regional banks tend to report early in the cycle. Wedbush Securities Managing Director David Chiaverini joins Yahoo Finance to give a preview.', 'Chiaverini argues that when the Federal Reserve starts cutting rates, it will be a positive for the regionals. However, he says that though the recent rally in regional banks stocks is ""warranted,"" he thinks ""upside is going to be limited, because I\'m not expecting the Fed to be cutting as soon as what the market is predicting.""

Find out which banks he likes by watching the video above.', 'Click here to watch the full interview on the Yahoo Finance YouTube page or you can watch this full episode of Yahoo Finance Live here.', ""Editor's note: This article was written by Stephanie Mikulich"", ""SEANA SMITH: It's great to see you. So right there at the top of your note, you stated the fact that you think the Fed pivot is going to bode well here for regionals. Is it still though too early to say that regional banks are out of the woods just yet?"", ""DAVID CHIAVERINI: Yeah, good question. So I don't think banks are out of the woods. Now, the rally is warranted. But I think upside is going to be limited because I'm not expecting the Fed to be cutting as soon as what the market is predicting."", ""And I think these higher rates that we're living with are still going to slow the economy. And the lagged impact of all the rate increases that we've seen over the past year have yet to manifest in the economy. So I am expecting slowing economic growth-- this could impact credit quality for the banks-- and slow loan growth, which has been under pressure. So, no, I don't think that they're out of the woods just yet."", ""MADISON MILLS: And what about that higher-for-longer impact can we expect to come up most in the regional bank earnings? Is it that loan piece that you mentioned? Or is it more of the deposits that we've always been talking about with regionals?"", ""DAVID CHIAVERINI: Yeah, it's a combination of both as well as with credit quality. So the deposit costs are likely to continue to increase but at a much slower pace. In fact, I expect deposit costs to plateau within the next quarter too. And net interest margins should trough. And net interest income should trough within the next couple of quarters."", ""So lower interest rates are helping on that side. Lower interest rates will also help on the credit quality front. But to your question about, you know, higher for longer, that's the big risk, is when these borrowers, particularly on the commercial real estate side, look to refinance their loans albeit at a incrementally lower rate than what was occurring, say, a month ago or two months ago, it's still a lot higher than when these loans were originally put on the books."", ""And that's where we could see some stress with some borrowers. And credit costs could end up moving higher from here and offsetting some of the impact of a rebound in net interest income in the back half of 2024."", 'SEANA SMITH: So, David, given the fact that there is still a lot of uncertainty ahead, there are still some risks out there, it sounds like investors, if they are looking at this space, still need to be a bit defensive. Who in your view is best positioned than at this point?', ""DAVID CHIAVERINI: Yeah, I would say banks that have strong capital ratios. That way, they'll be in position to put some capital to work if we do happen to get a soft landing, as well as defensive from the standpoint of if credit quality does weaken, those banks with higher stronger capital levels will be able to withstand the blows a bit better."", 'We also think that those banks with loan portfolios that tend to perform better in downturns should also be considered. So banks like-- you know, we like First Horizon here. We like First Citizens, East PacWest Bancorp, Fifth Third, Western Alliance, M&T Bank. These banks we think are better positioned for this type of backdrop.']"

This marked a remarkable comeback for the index, showcasing its most impressive performance since 2020. Investors were drawn to the resurgence of these tech stocks, eclipsing the allure of dividends for many during this period."", ""Despite the shifting investor preferences towards tech stocks, companies in the US remained committed to rewarding their shareholders through dividends.

Moreover, the collective sum distributed to shareholders reached an all-time high of $588.2 billion, showcasing a notable rise from the previous year's $564.6 billion.

And it goes to 53. How come? Just walk us through the argument, Linda, why you decided now was the time to move to the sidelines.', ""LINDA BOLTON WEISER: Sure. Well, there's really three key reasons. I would say the tone of the company has really changed.

And they really made it sound like the growth prospects for the toy business in 2024 were no growth, you know, decline."", ""And I think that was, to me, a different change in tone.

The growth is just too high, both top-line growth and the profit growth. The operating profit the Street has is over 25% growth for 2024. I think they're going to guide lower than that."", ""And thirdly, I'm concerned that their cash flow in the next few years, their free cash flow will not be high enough to make a big enough dent in paying down their debt to get their leverage ratio down as fast as they would like.

Franchise groups in Kuwait, Pakistan and other countries issued statements saying they did not share ownership with the Israeli franchise, and some of those franchises noted they have made financial donations to aid those in Gaza.', 'At issue is McDonald’s franchise model, in which independently owned and operated restaurants make decisions separately from the company. Customers might be unaware of the distinction and believe an action one location takes is always officially sanctioned by the McDonald’s corporation or reflective of the positions of other locations.', 'The vast majority of McDonald’s locations are run by local franchise operators. These operators act in many ways as independent businesses: They set wages and prices and, when they feel it appropriate, make statements or donations at their discretion. That approach has helped make McDonald’s a global phenomenon, with over 40,000 locations globally, including nearly 27,000 outside of the United States, as of 2022. But it means the company can’t dictate how each operator responds in a crisis, for better or worse.', 'McDonald’s is expected to report earnings later this month, when it could reveal more about the issues mentioned by Kempczinski.', 'In December 2023, Starbucks made comments about people protesting the company and disrupting its stores over the Israel-Hamas war.', '“We see protestors influenced by misrepresentation on social media of what we stand for,” said Starbucks CEO Laxman Narasimhan in a letter to employees and customers.', '“Cities around the world – including here in North America – have seen escalating protests. Many of our stores have experienced incidents of vandalism,” he said. “We have worked with local authorities to ensure our partners and customers are safe.”', 'CNN’s Danielle Wiener-Bronner contributed to this report.', 'For more CNN news and newsletters create an account at CNN.com']"

Active accounts have gone from 179 million to roughly 430 million during that same stretch."", ""Schulman disciples — aka PayPal leaders — have gone on to major C-suite roles elsewhere, such as Walmart's (WMT) CFO John David Rainey (former PayPal CFO) and Pinterest (PINS) CEO Bill Ready (former PayPal COO)."", ""As PayPal's profile rose, so did Schulman's, spurring him to tackle social issues he thought should be addressed by a prominent leader that isn't afraid to speak out."", 'None was more headline-grabbing than the decision to cancel plans to open a global operations center in Charlotte, N.C., after lawmakers passed a controversial law targeting LGBT people in 2016.', '""The new law perpetuates discrimination and it violates the values and principles that are at the core of PayPal\'s mission and culture,"" Schulman said in a statement at the time.', 'Schulman concedes today that the decision to speak out came with unintended aftershocks.', '""I felt like that was anathema to our values,"" Schulman tells me. ""And so we pulled out of North Carolina. I had no idea that it would be front page news of the New York Times. I had no idea the number of death threats that I would get as a result of that and hate email.""', '""My view is that our platform should be a platform where you can have civil discourse, where you can raise money for organizations that don\'t advocate violence or extreme hatred,” continued Schulman. “You would think there wouldn\'t be much controversy of taking down neo-Nazi sites or KKK sites, but there always are.""', 'As they say in life, nothing is perfect. And even Schulman had a few bumps in the road retiring from PayPal.', ""Today, PayPal's market cap stands around $65 billion, amid slower growth and rising competition from newer entrants such as Robinhood (HOOD), Affirm (AFRM), and Coinbase (COIN), and legacy payment brands like his former employer Amex and Mastercard (MA)."", 'Apple (AAPL) and Google (GOOGL) have also made strong inroads into the payments industry with offerings of their own.', ""Towards the end of Schulman's tenure, PayPal was attacked by famed activist investor Elliott Management in the summer of 2022. Elliott demanded cost cuts to offset pressures on the top line and boost the sagging stock price."", 'The company went on to outline $900 million in cost cuts — mostly through layoffs, real estate consolidation, and project cutbacks. It also uncorked a $15 billion stock buyback plan.', 'With that situation done and dusted, Schulman and the board got to work on picking his successor.', ""By December 2023, Schulman left PayPal's board, with the ship firmly in the hands of Chriss, who's been in the trenches outlining his plans for the company Schulman took public."", 'As for what\'s next, Schulman hints he has a lot of well-earned options — including ""senior"" government roles — being offered. He declined to share specifics.', 'He plans to reveal his next move in the coming months, after taking some time off and assessing the choices with his wife and kids.', '""One of the things that I am struggling with a little bit right now is the number of opportunities in front of me and trying to think about what do I want my life to look like going forward,"" Schulman says. ""I feel no pressure in making a lot of decisions right away.”', ""Wherever Schulman ends up, this journalist thinks a black shirt, light blue jeans, and cowboy boots won't be too far behind.

Per MPTI’s investor update, among the given end markets, defense and aerospace, and avionics are the main revenue contributors with a hold of 58% and 21%, respectively, of total revenues (as of Sep 30, 2023).In the first nine months of 2023, the company’s revenues grew 31.2% from the year-ago period's level, driven by the recovering avionics market and strong defense product shipments. The company believes that the growing trends in the end markets position it well for long-term success.Higher ROE: M-tron’s trailing 12-month ROE is 22.9%, higher than the industry’s 16.3%. This implies that the company is getting less efficient at creating profits and increasing shareholders’ value with respect to its industry.Strategic Separation Move: On Oct 7, 2022, M-tron announced its official separation from The LGL Group, Inc., thus becoming the sole publicly traded company. This strategic move became a growth driver for the company, helping it to efficiently allocate its resources.

This, along with brand-enhancement strategies, has been working well for Mondelez International, Inc.

Some companies also provide comfort food items, such as chocolates and ready-to-serve meals, soups and snacks. A few players are engaged in providing pet food products and supplements. Several food companies also offer organic and natural products. Companies operating in this space sell their products mostly through wholesalers, distributors, large retail organizations, grocery chains, mass merchandisers, drug stores and e-commerce service providers.

Consumers’ loyalty to specific brands, combined with companies' unwavering focus on innovation, has been a driving force.

Apart from this, endeavors to enhance manufacturing capabilities and strengthen product portfolios have proven successful for numerous food companies, positioning them favorably for future growth. Their ability to adapt to evolving consumer preferences and market dynamics has emerged as a winning formula.Proactive Pricing Endeavors: Food companies have found relief in their effective pricing measures amid the industry-wide cost inflation. As the demand for food products remains relatively stable, consumers generally absorb the increase in prices for their preferred brands. We believe that the ability to set prices competitively will continue to be advantageous for food companies, contributing to their sales and overall performance.Elevated Costs: Although showing moderation, input cost inflation has been a drag on companies’ margins. Food companies have been witnessing the increased cost of ingredients, which, along with high labor, packaging and logistic costs, has been weighing on its profits. Apart from this, companies have been facing escalating operational expenses in their efforts to step up performance. The persistence of these aspects remains a concern for food players’ profits.Volume Concerns: Food companies have been seeing soft volumes for a while due to a volatile macroeconomic landscape. The inflationary landscape pinched consumers’ pockets, leading them to look for budget-friendly alternatives and shift from big brands toward private-label companies.

The latest deal will see APA Corporation (NASDAQ: APA) acquire fellow oil company Callon Petroleum (NYSE: CPE). That acquisition will enhance APA's scale in the resource-rich Permian Basin. "", ""The deal follows the blueprint of leaders ExxonMobil (NYSE: XOM) and Occidental Petroleum (NYSE: OXY), which have made large deals in that same region. Here's a look at the latest oil stock merger and what it means for investors."", 'APA Corporation is buying Callon Petroleum in an all-stock deal valued at $4.5 billion, including the assumption of debt. The merger will create a much larger oil company with a total enterprise value of more than $21 billion and combined production of over 500,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day (BOE/D).', ""The main draw of Callon is its nearly 120,000-acre position in the oil-rich Delaware Basin side of the Permian. That complements APA's Midland-focused position, giving the company greater scale across that entire region:"", ""As the slide shows, the deal will more than double APA's acreage and production from the Delaware Basin, while also adding some incremental acreage and output in the Midland. That increased scale will enable APA to capture cost savings and other synergies, which it estimates is over $150 million annually. "", ""Those cost savings are helping drive the company's view that the acquisition will be accretive to its financial metrics, including free cash flow per share. While the transaction will cause a slight rise in the company's leverage ratio (from 1x to 1.1x), it will maintain a strong investment-grade balance sheet following the deal."", 'The company plans to maintain its capital return framework of returning at least 60% of its free cash flow to shareholders through its strong base dividend (currently yielding 2.7%) and share repurchases. Given the accretive nature of the transaction, APA should be able to repurchase more shares in the future while strengthening its balance sheet. ', ""APA Corp's acquisition of Callon Petroleum follows the patterns of recent deals by ExxonMobil and Occidental Petroleum. Exxon is acquiring Pioneer Natural Resources in an all-stock transaction valued at $64.5 billion (including the assumption of debt). "", ""That acquisition will significantly enhance Exxon's position in the Midland Basin, where Pioneer is a leading producer and will more than double Exxon's Permian acreage and its regional production. That increased scale should boost Exxon's cash flow and returns. "", ""Meanwhile, Occidental Petroleum recently agreed to acquire CrownRock for $12 billion in stock, cash, and the assumption of debt. That deal will enhance the oil company's position in the Midland Basin side of the Permian."", 'It drives its view that the acquisition will bolster its free cash flow. That gave Occidental the confidence to boost its dividend by 22%.', 'All three deals share a common theme. The acquiring company is enhancing its position in the Permian to grow its scale so it can capture cost savings and produce more free cash flow. That will position them to return more money to shareholders through higher dividends and repurchase rates.', 'With those larger oil producers getting bigger and better, it will likely spur more merger and acquisition (M&A) activity in the oil patch. ConocoPhillips, Devon Energy, and other rivals were interested in buying CrownRock before Occidental Petroleum won the bidding. With CrownRock and now Callon Petroleum finding suitors, these interested bidders need to turn their attention elsewhere for a deal. ', 'There are lots of possibilities, including Endeavor Energy Partners, which reportedly put itself up for sale. Future deals would likely follow a similar blueprint as recent ones, with the acquirer increasing its scale to reduce costs so it can produce more free cash to return to shareholders. ', ""APA Corp is the latest oil company to participate in the sector's current consolidation wave. Its deal follows those of the industry leaders by bolstering its position in the Permian, enabling it to capture cost savings and boost its free cash flow to return more money to investors. That will put pressure on rivals that haven't yet found a deal, which could fuel more mergers in the coming months.

That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock."", ""Our analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well.

Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements."", 'For the current quarter, Occidental is expected to post earnings of $1.10 per share, indicating a change of -31.7% from the year-ago quarter.

They do mention the senior loan officer survey that I really want to point out because they talk about some of the credit tightening that we're seeing and how that could start to be the thing that buckles the consumer."", 'Having said that, they do say that discretionary spending is actually higher than it was pre-pandemic. But that some of the market risks could start to pull that down.', 'SEANA SMITH: Certainly, we have seen the consumer be extremely resilient up until this point. But what I thought was interesting was very similar to along the lines of what you were saying.

One of their top stock picks, saying that early investments in tech and e-commerce and a continued price investment have positioned it for future gains."", ""They do note what we were saying earlier, Seana, that they tend toward a lower consumer, but that's not necessarily a bad thing for Walmart, right? I always think about how Walmart is the biggest grocer in the US. So when the consumer is starting to buckle a bit, they may continue to spend at a place like Walmart as they're getting their groceries."", ""They also note that interest from $100,000 household income customers is starting to go up as well, again, indicating some of that trade down for Walmart and a mix in products as well, which is what you were mentioning is a boon for Ulta.

The benefit was statistically significant, but there's been criticism regarding the way data was collected."", ""The European Medicines Agency hasn't approved Amylyx's drug yet, so plenty of eyes will be watching for results from an ongoing phase 3 study, named Phoenix, that could wrap up in March.

Let's consider why investing $1,000 into any (or all) of these corporations would be an excellent move."", 'Novo Nordisk has been grabbing headlines all year thanks to its work in developing and marketing diabetes and weight loss medicines such as Wegovy and Ozempic. Obesity is a worsening global health crisis, and the biotech stands at the forefront in combating it. With sales of anti-obesity drugs set to skyrocket, Novo Nordisk is poised to benefit in the years ahead.', ""Moreover, the company is seeking multiple important label extensions for its key therapies, including in treating kidney disease and nonalcoholic steatohepatitis -- which could add billions in revenue for Novo Nordisk. Further, the Denmark-based biotech giant has been seeking to diversify its lineup. It is developing medicines for various rare diseases, Alzheimer's, and several other conditions."", ""Novo Nordisk has crushed the market this year and with good reason. With an initial investment of $1,000, investors can get nine shares of the biotech at current levels with some money to spare. Or you could get three shares for about $311 and reserve the remainder for one of the stocks below. Either way, it'd be money well spent."", ""Eli Lilly is in the same boat as Novo Nordisk. It's a leader in the diabetes and obesity care markets and stands to benefit from the rapid increase in drug sales in these areas. However, Eli Lilly has a secret weapon. Its anti-obesity medicine, Zepbound (marketed as Mounjaro to treat type 2 diabetes), will arguably lead the pack. Sales of Zepbound could hit a peak of $25 billion, according to some analysts."", ""It could become one of the best-selling medicines in the history of the biotech industry. However, even beyond Zepbound and its other diabetes medicines, Eli Lilly's lineup is diversified. It has important immunology drugs in its arsenal, such as Taltz and the recently approved ulcerative colitis therapy, Omvoh."", ""In oncology, it markets Verzenio and the also newly approved Jaypirca. Perhaps most notably, Eli Lilly is now awaiting word from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for donanemab, a potential medicine for Alzheimer's disease. Eli Lilly's financial results and stock performances have also been great all year long, and that shouldn't stop anytime soon."", ""The company's stock price has soared in recent years -- shares are changing hands for $569 apiece. Buying just one share could go a long way, provided investors hold onto it for a while and progressively add to their positions over time."", ""Vertex Pharmaceuticals has long dominated the market for therapies that treat cystic fibrosis (CF), a rare disease that affects the lungs and other internal organs. The company's monopoly in this area has served it well, constantly catapulting its revenue and earnings to new heights. While its top-line growth rates have slowed over time, there remains plenty of work for Vertex in the CF area."", 'However, the company recently started a new chapter with the approval of Casgevy, which it developed with CRISPR Therapeutics. Casgevy is a gene-editing treatment for sickle cell disease and beta thalassemia. These two rare blood diseases have largely eluded the medical community. Casgevy undoubtedly boasts blockbuster potential, but it could be just the beginning.', ""Vertex plans on launching several more medicines in the next five years or so. The company's top-line growth rates should improve as it will no longer depend on its CF lineup to generate sales. Further, Vertex will also mitigate the risk, however remote, that some other biotech would come to challenge it in its core area of expertise.

You'll own a business with a dominant market position in an attractive global industry, to start. Toss in Coke's industry-leading profitability, with its operating margin roughly double PepsiCo's level. And the beverage giant is expanding sales at a decent clip, meaning you don't have to sacrifice on growth to own this mature business. Coke last reported an 11% organic sales increase in fiscal Q3."", ""Yet the stock underperformed the market by a wide margin in 2023. Don't spend too much time trying to guess why that might be. Instead, consider buying Coke at its discounted price. Shares are valued at 23 times earnings, down from nearly 30 times earnings in early 2023."", ""Coke's dividend yield is sitting at just over 3% right now, which means a $500 investment would secure you roughly $15 of annual income to start.

The tech giant is expanding its massive business at a solid clip these days despite weakness in areas like consumer tech devices and the wider PC market. Overall sales rose 12% last quarter to cross $56 billion, mainly thanks to big gains in its cloud services division."", ""Wall Street is excited about the potential for Microsoft to cash in on the artificial intelligence (AI) boom over the coming years. The software-as-a-service giant is already getting a big lift from the tech, which has spurred more demand across its cloud platform and boosted profit margins. Speaking of profitability, Microsoft sports one of the highest operating margins around. This metric recently touched a new high of 43% of sales.

In recent years, those increases have been just a single penny, amounting to less than a 1% boost.', ""Yet with the company's 64-year streak on the line, most investors anticipate that 3M will once again deliver at least a token increase when it declares its next dividend. That typically happens a couple of weeks after the company announces its fourth-quarter results, which most shareholders expect will be in the fourth week of January. Still, some worry that with billions of dollars in settlements over legal issues, 3M might choose to conserve cash by foregoing a dividend increase in 2024."", ""Dividend investors appreciate the long track records of success from companies like 3M, Coca-Cola, and Chevron.

Think ChatGPT but specifically designed to help solve tax, accounting, marketing, cash flow and personal finance challenges.', 'Moving forward, Intuit should command extraordinary relevancies thanks to the burgeoning gig economy.

While Deere may be an old dog (founded in 1837), it’s eagerly learning new tricks.

Instead, DraftKings brings the casino to us.', 'What’s more, the company goes about its business in a sophisticated manner, making it a surprising AI stock. Indeed, the Boston-based sports betting company has long used AI in taking bets and targeting advertising to consumers, according to an Innolead publication. Further, DraftKings leverage machine learning models to gather large volumes of data to provide various conveniences. Through its understanding of customer behaviors and betting patterns, the DraftKings app offers more seamless navigation.', 'Further, its tech enables dynamic pricing; that is, the robots can adjust odds and betting lines in real time based on current game situations and betting activity.

The sale at $700 million, before prorations and closing costs, not only showcased the resilience of the real estate market but also demonstrated the companies\' strategic prowess in unlocking value from their portfolio.Macerich\'s CEO, Tom O’Hern, noted that the transaction exemplifies the company\'s ability to maximize opportunities for stakeholders.

This strategy involves adding new uses, such as fitness, grocery, medical, residential, hotel and office spaces, to its high-quality portfolio of Regional Town Centers in attractive U.S. markets.Victor Coleman, the chairman and CEO of Hudson Pacific, echoed the sentiment, emphasizing the opportunistic nature of the sale, stating, ""The opportunistic sale of One Westside and Westside Two significantly bolsters our balance sheet and we now have no debt maturities until year-end 2025.""Hudson Pacific transformed the former Westside Pavilion mall into a modern and flexible campus environment, attracting two large-scale, high-quality end-users. Coleman attributed this success to the company\'s development expertise, commitment to quality and strong relationships.Hudson Pacific, an office REIT that specializes in serving dynamic tech and media tenants globally, utilized the net proceeds from the sale to repay outstanding amounts on its unsecured revolving credit facility. This not only addressed the company’s debt maturities until December 2025 but also strengthened its compliance with unsecured revolving credit facility covenants.

The Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE: BRK.A) (NYSE: BRK.B) chief executive officer has a track record of trouncing the S&P 500 over a nearly 60-year history, as Berkshire has generated a compounded annual return of about 20% -- double that of the S&P 500."", ""Luckily for investors, it's easy to see what Buffett's Berkshire conglomerate owns because the company must report its holdings to the Securities and Exchange Commission every quarter. Based on Berkshire's holdings as of the third quarter, here are two Buffett stocks worth buying in 2024."", 'The Oracle of Omaha\'s favorite bank is the first Buffett stock to consider for 2024. Bank of America (NYSE: BAC) isn\'t just his favorite bank stock -- it\'s also Berkshire\'s second-largest holding behind Apple.\xa0Buffett has sung the praises of BofA CEO Brian Moynihan on more than one occasion, saying he likes Moynihan ""enormously"" and that he avoids doing ""dumb things.""', 'The Berkshire chief has been investing in financial stocks since his career began and is an expert in the sector. One of his biggest concerns in banks is management, and Moynihan has done an excellent job repairing Bank of America after its blowup during the financial crisis.', 'Today, the bank continues to grow, even in a challenging economic environment. In its third quarter, Bank of America reported a 10% increase in net income to $7.8 billion on a 3% increase in revenue to $25.2 billion. The profit growth benefited, in part, from a lower tax rate, but the bank also delivered solid results. Businesses have been wary of borrowing, and higher interest rates have made deposits more expensive.', 'Bank of America missed out on the 2023 stock market rally due, in part, to a sell-off during the regional banking crisis in March that now seems undeserved. However, 2024 could be a more rewarding year for the stock.', ""A recession now seems unlikely, and BofA isn't expecting one. Falling interest rates should encourage more consumer and business spending, and the stock looks historically cheap at a price-to-earnings ratio of 9.5. The bank also has a lot of room to raise its dividend -- the stock currently yields 2.9%."", 'With the economy shifting to recovery and the stock looking cheap, Bank of America seems well-positioned to make gains this year.', 'Another stock that looks set to benefit from the expected economic recovery this year is D.R. Horton (NYSE: DHI), the largest U.S. homebuilder.', ""D.R. Horton was one of the three homebuilder stocks that Berkshire bought in the second quarter of 2023, along with Lennar and NVR. Currently, the company's stock looks well-priced, and its business should continue to benefit from a housing market that has suffered from a lack of inventory available for sale."", ""Homeowners were able to take advantage of rock-bottom rates during the pandemic, and many of those buyers are reluctant to sell and lose out on those rates, especially with mortgage rates hovering around 7%. Additionally, there's a large housing shortage in the U.S., estimated at 4 million homes across the country. It will take years, or even decades, before this shortage ends, helping to prop up homes prices."", 'In other words, demand for new homes is strong and could be supported by expected interest-rate cuts from the Fed this year. D.R. Horton is well-capitalized and well-positioned to take advantage of that demand.', 'Revenue in its fiscal fourth quarter increased 9% to $10.5 billion, while sales orders jumped 39% to 18,939 homes. This showed a considerable backlog in demand.', ""The company's balance sheet has improved significantly during the past year, as well, with its cash balance growing from $2.6 billion to $3.9 billion. In addition, its debt fell from $6.1 billion to $5.1 billion."", 'With demand for new homes expected to remain strong in 2024 and D.R. Horton trading at a price-to-earnings ratio of just 11, the stock looks like a good bet to continue gaining in 2024.', 'Should you invest $1,000 in Bank of America right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Bank of America, consider this:', ""The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Bank of America wasn't one of them.

Homebuilding companies have consistently revealed impressive quarterly results, expressing optimism about the growth of new orders and deliveries in the upcoming quarters.In fact, the Federal Reserve's decision to maintain interest rates at a 22-year high of 5.25-5.5% brings optimism to the housing market. The Federal Open Market Committee hints at potential rate cuts by the end of 2024. This stability provides relief for companies like D.R. Horton, Inc. DHI, Lennar Corporation LEN, Dream Finders Homes, Inc. DFH, PulteGroup, Inc. PHM and others. Home prices and borrowing rates are expected to find equilibrium, addressing the demand-supply gap resulting from significant underbuilding over the last decade and homeowners' reluctance to abandon low-rate mortgages.Given the current scenario, quality homebuilding stocks could offer a safe haven because of their stability and the fact that these are fundamentally strong enough to withstand the industry woes. The Zacks Building Products - Home Builders industry currently carries a Zacks Industry Rank #56, which places it in the top 22% of more than 250 Zacks industries.Among the industry bellwethers, D.R. Horton and Lennar are the most prominent ones. At present, the market capitalization of D.R. Horton is $49.27 billion, while that of Lennar stands at $40.96 billion. Both D.R. Horton and Lennar currently carry a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Before drawing a head-to-head comparison between DHI and LEN, let’s check out a few key statistics of the companies."", 'D.R. Horton offers a diverse line of homes across various price points through a multi-brand platform like D.R. Horton, Emerald Homes, Express Homes and Freedom Homes. Moreover, the company enjoys one of the broadest geographic diversities in the industry and is not dependent on any particular market. It has a strong presence in 118 markets across 33 states across the United States. With a record 89,092 homes closed by its homebuilding and single-family rental operations in fiscal 2023, D.R. Horton completed its 22nd consecutive year as the largest homebuilder in the United States.During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023, net sales orders rose 39% year over year to 18,939 homes. The value of net orders also increased 34% year over year to $7.3 billion.Conversely, Lennar operates as a homebuilder primarily under the Lennar brand in the United States, targeting first-time, move-up, and active adult homebuyers. The company provides mortgage financing and related services to customers through the financial services segment.Lennar’s core homebuilding results remained resilient in fiscal 2023. Lennar’s solid operating strategy of focusing on production and sales pace over price, generating strong cash flow, increasing returns on equity and assets and driving a robust bottom line bode well.', 'Image Source: Zacks Investment Research', 'DHI and LEN have gained 42.6% and 34.1%, respectively, over the past three months. The industry has collectively gained 36.9% during the period. DHI fared much better than LEN on this front.', 'The ability to consistently boost profit levels and defy industry woes is a defining characteristic of the best companies. Analysts expect DHI’s earnings to grow 2.5% in fiscal 2024. Comparatively, LEN’s earnings are expected to grow 0.8% over the same time frame. Hence, DHI’s higher growth rate implies a greater potential for capital appreciation.Earnings estimates have increased 1.4% for DHI but decreased 2.4% for LEN over the past 60 days.Meanwhile, considering earnings history, DHI and LEN both surpassed estimates in all the last four quarters, delivering average earnings surprises of 28.9% and 21.7%, respectively.', 'The industry is clearly undervalued than the S&P 500, with respect to the forward 12-month price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio. This implies that the industry has upside potential for the near future. The industry has an average forward 12-month P/E ratio of 10.7, which is below the S&P 500’s average of 20.5. Hence, it might be a good idea to focus on stocks belonging to this particular industry.Coming to the two stocks under consideration, DHI and LEN — with a 12-month forward P/E ratio of 10.3 and 10, respectively — are undervalued than the S&P 500 and the industry.Comparing the two stocks, LEN is less pricey than DHI.', 'Return on Equity (ROE) is a measure of a company’s efficiency in utilizing shareholders’ funds. ROE in the trailing 12 months for DHI is 21.9%. LEN’s trailing 12-month ROE is 15.8%. Markedly, DHI provides more impressive returns to investors than LEN and the industry’s 18.2%.', 'Currently, D.R. Horton’s industry-leading market share, solid acquisition strategy, well-stocked supply of land, lots and homes, along with affordable product offerings across multiple brands and strong operational performance, make it a better housing pick than Lennar. Especially in terms of share price performance, earnings growth rate and returns, D.R. Horton has more upside potential than Lennar in 2024.', 'Dream Finders Homes currently sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

Investors following this investing style typically avoid betting on cheap stocks and waiting long for them to recover. They believe instead that one could make far more money in lesser time by ""buying high and selling higher.""', ""Who doesn't like betting on fast-moving trending stocks? But determining the right entry point isn't easy. Often, these stocks lose momentum once their valuation moves ahead of their future growth potential. In such a situation, investors find themselves loaded up on expensive shares with limited to no upside or even a downside. So, going all-in on momentum could be risky at times."", ""It could be safer to invest in bargain stocks that have been witnessing price momentum recently. While the Zacks Momentum Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to trends in a stock's price or earnings, is pretty useful in identifying great momentum stocks, our 'Fast-Paced Momentum at a Bargain' screen comes handy in spotting fast-moving stocks that are still attractively priced."", 'Universal Health Services (UHS) is one of the several great candidates that made it through the screen. While there are numerous reasons why this stock is a great choice, here are the most vital ones:', ""Investors' growing interest in a stock is reflected in its recent price increase. A price change of 13.2% over the past four weeks positions the stock of this hospital and health facility operator well in this regard."", 'While any stock can see a spike in price for a short period, it takes a real momentum player to deliver positive returns for a longer time frame. UHS meets this criterion too, as the stock gained 20.5% over the past 12 weeks.', 'Moreover, the momentum for UHS is fast paced, as the stock currently has a beta of 1.25. This indicates that the stock moves 25% higher than the market in either direction.', 'Given this price performance, it is no surprise that UHS has a Momentum Score of B, which indicates that this is the right time to enter the stock to take advantage of the momentum with the highest probability of success.', ""In addition to a favorable Momentum Score, an upward trend in earnings estimate revisions has helped UHS earn a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). Our research shows that the momentum-effect is quite strong among Zacks Rank #1 and #2 stocks.

You can see the complete list of today's Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stocks here >>>>"", 'Most importantly, despite possessing fast-paced momentum features, UHS is trading at a reasonable valuation. In terms of Price-to-Sales ratio, which is considered as one of the best valuation metrics, the stock looks quite cheap now. UHS is currently trading at 0.74 times its sales. In other words, investors need to pay only 74 cents for each dollar of sales.', 'So, UHS appears to have plenty of room to run, and that too at a fast pace.', ""In addition to UHS, there are several other stocks that currently pass through our 'Fast-Paced Momentum at a Bargain' screen.

No longer content to, as it did in the fall, label PepsiCo’s examples of “shrinkflation,” a nasty variant of inflation where the bag gets emptier while the price remains the same, or even increases, now the French grocery giant is doubling down. Starting Thursday with in-store signs that cite “unacceptable price increases,” the supermarket chain is telling shoppers in four countries that it will no longer carry PepsiCo products.', 'The changes start this week in France, Italy, Spain, and Belgium, meaning Cheetos, Doritos, and Quaker cereals will suddenly be harder to find there.', 'But this is just the latest clash between the two behemoths. In September, Carrefour started labeling egregious examples of shrinkflation on its shelves, with PepsiCo a prominent target. The labels read: “This product has seen its volume or weight fall and the effective price from the supplier rise.”', 'James Walton, chief economist at the Institute of Grocery Distribution, calls delisting a “last resort,” telling Reuters that “nobody wins if the goods that people want are not available on the shelves.”', 'But Carrefour has on its side European governments, which have been pressuring big companies to lower prices in the battle against inflation.', 'Carrefour CEO Alexandre Bompard argued last year that consumer goods companies were not cooperating with efforts to cut prices, despite the cost of raw materials falling. French finance minister Bruno Le Maire agreed, pointing a finger at PepsiCo, Unilever, and Nestlé, in particular.', '“I don’t see why when prices go up companies pass on the increase immediately, but when the price of wheat falls, the price of pasta takes three months to fall. It’s unacceptable,” Le Maire said last April, warning, “I will use all the powers at my disposal to ensure that the big industrial companies pass on the decrease.”', 'France’s government has asked retailers and suppliers to finish their yearly price negotiations in January, a few months sooner than usual, Reuters reported. France is unusual in that it protects its farmers by forcing supermarkets to negotiate prices only once a year, and last year prices got locked in amid high inflation.', 'The shrinkflation campaign aimed to make suppliers rethink their pricing policies, but, judging by Carrefour’s move this week, it fell short with PepsiCo. And Carrefour isn’t the only supermarket chain taking a stand in Europe. Its Belgian rival Colruyt said that price disputes spurred it to stop supplies from Mondelez—the maker of Oreos and Philadelphia cream cheese. As Reuters reported, the grocer noted that with energy and raw material prices falling, rate hikes were no longer justifiable.', 'This story was originally featured on Fortune.com']"
