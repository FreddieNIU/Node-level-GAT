Among the study’s findings is a strong belief from its more seasoned investors that timeless investing principles such as persistence, diversification, early and regular investing, investing through different cycles, and sticking with a plan – are keys to their success.This press release features multimedia. View the full release here: https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20231004229740/en/Charles Schwab, Founder &amp; Co-Chairman. (Photo: Business Wire)""I hear regularly from clients, many who started with us at the beginning – forty, even fifty years ago – and they tell me that, more than anything, discipline, patience and learning from the occasional mistake pay off and have brought them a financial freedom they could only have dreamed of,"" said Schwab founder and co-chairman Charles Schwab. ""Fifty years of experience shows us that diligent investors reap consistent rewards and really are the smart money.""Conducted to commemorate the firm’s 50th anniversary, The Wisdom of the Crowd surveyed more than 3,000 Schwab clients, ranging from its most seasoned clients who opened their accounts in Schwab’s earliest days to those who have just recently ventured into investing.Consistent investing principlesWhen asked to share the lessons they’ve learned over time, investors who have been at it the longest pointed to concepts such as consistency and discipline as core to their success and lack of research and bad timing as central to their unsuccessful outings. These investors offered relatively consistent advice for those newer to investing, such as:Story continues""Long-term viewpoints are crucial to sticking to a plan when everything seems to be down and the selling seems relentless. If you stick to your plan you will do extremely well over long periods of time.""""Be realistic. Be patient. Don’t get emotional. Diversify, diversify, diversify.""""Align investments with your personal goals in mind; retirement, college, new house, etc.""""Consistency is very big in investing. Even a small amount will grow if you add to it on a consistent basis.""""Fifty years of experience working with tens of millions of clients provides an invaluable window into what works best for investors,"" said Jonathan Craig, managing director and head of Schwab Investor Services. ""We know that staying in the market longer pays off, but were eager to hear directly from clients about the lessons they’ve learned along the way and to understand differences for those who’ve been at it longer and those newer to investing. Seeing the wisdom in a principled approach from our most experienced investors made a ton of sense to us. But we were pleasantly surprised to see that kind of thinking also reflected in large portions of investors across the entire age and experience spectrum.""Time and patience are virtuesThe survey reinforced that one of the most valuable assets successful investors possess has nothing to do with money – it is time. The length of time investors have been active is among the most important factors influencing how they navigate, fare in, and feel towards the markets. The survey found that:The vast majority (86%) of investors who’ve been at it since before 2000 said they don’t let their emotions get in the way of their investments now, as compared to when they first started investing.Investors who have been in the market the longest are also the investors who are having the most fun: 63% of those who’ve been investing since 1980 said they are having more fun with their investments now than when they first started, while only 55% of the newest investors said the same.More experienced investors also have more pride: 80% of investors who began in the 1980s or earlier are proud of their accomplishments as an investor.Investors are really good at tuning out the noiseWhile there were some differences depending on how long investors had been at it, what they have in common reveals that decades of consistent investor education is working: rather than fall prey to emotions, distractions and hyped promises of performance, investors at every stage are remarkably disciplined:Nearly nine in ten investors described themselves as more like a tortoise than a hare – deliberate and steady.Nearly nine in ten said if they were given $100,000 today, they’d limit risk and potential short-term gains to focus on slower but steady long-term growth.More than three-quarters of investors said that if they could only use one investment product for the rest of their lives, it would be a broad market index fund.One-third said patience through volatility contributed most to their investing success.Generational experiences also shape investor attitudes and behaviorsSome behavioral differences emerged between those who have been investing for two decades or more and those with less experience. For example, seasoned investors reported a steadier personal engagement in investing, but on the flip side are less inclined to react to market moves:Investors who…opened account before 2000opened account after 2000Identify as self-directed67%56%Check investments often/regularly and get involved in investment decisions62%50%Do nothing in the face of a market downswing (i.e., neither buy nor sell)56%46%And digging one step deeper, Schwab’s survey suggests that Gen X and Millennials tend to be more sensitive to market moves than Boomers, and more likely to act in the face of market volatility:Investors who…MillennialsGen XBoomersWould buy or sell in an up market42%42%36%Would buy or sell in a down market62%56%47%""The past 30 years have seen significant economic upheaval, the effects of which have disproportionately fallen on younger cohorts,"" said Mark Riepe, managing director and head of the Schwab Center for Financial Research. ""Economic events, combined with factors like the rise of student debt, the decline of pensions, and persistent political uncertainty, have naturally shaped how investors engage with the markets. It’s important to learn from your experiences, but you want to learn the right lessons. It’s especially important to avoid overreacting – if you do, you risk becoming a prisoner of your own experiences.""This insecurity and uncertainty may have a silver lining, however: Millennials and Gen X are more inclined towards collaboration and communication when it comes to investing:Investors who…MillennialsGen XBoomersFeel more comfortable working with a financial advisor now than when they began investing50%53%47%Discuss investing with their families more now than when they began investing75%74%62%Millennials also embrace their role as the influencer generation. Paradoxically, however, they’re also highly skeptical of the tips they receive from others:Nearly half of Millennials (45%) said they’ve given an investment recommendation.Just 46% said they invested based on a tip, compared to 51% of Gen X and 52% of Boomers.Only two in five (39%) Millennials said they’ve lost money investing based on a tip.Paying it forwardMost respondents (59%) said they wish they had more knowledge when they first started investing – and the data suggests that they are working to close that gap for others. Forty-eight percent of respondents said they’ve inspired someone to start investing, and 38% have taught someone else how to invest. More than a third (35%) have opened or helped open an investment account for someone else.""During the past 50 years, we’ve seen the markets become increasingly democratized, with more people learning about investing, participating and realizing its benefits,"" said Jonathan Craig. ""It’s incredibly satisfying to see so many clients rightly feel proud of what they’ve accomplished, practicing the time-tested principles that contribute to their success and eager to share what they’ve learned with others.""For additional findings, please read the full study here.

Ideally, a business will show two trends; firstly a growing return on capital employed (ROCE) and secondly, an increasing amount of capital employed. This shows us that it's a compounding machine, able to continually reinvest its earnings back into the business and generate higher returns. So when we looked at the ROCE trend of Nucor (NYSE:NUE) we really liked what we saw.What Is Return On Capital Employed (ROCE)?Just to clarify if you're unsure, ROCE is a metric for evaluating how much pre-tax income (in percentage terms) a company earns on the capital invested in its business. Analysts use this formula to calculate it for Nucor:Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)0.26 = US$7.6b ÷ (US$33b - US$4.0b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to July 2023).So, Nucor has an ROCE of 26%.  That's a fantastic return and not only that, it outpaces the average of 10% earned by companies in a similar industry. See our latest analysis for Nucor roceAbove you can see how the current ROCE for Nucor compares to its prior returns on capital, but there's only so much you can tell from the past. If you're interested, you can view the analysts predictions in our free report on analyst forecasts for the company.How Are Returns Trending?Investors would be pleased with what's happening at Nucor. The numbers show that in the last five years, the returns generated on capital employed have grown considerably to 26%. Basically the business is earning more per dollar of capital invested and in addition to that, 100% more capital is being employed now too. This can indicate that there's plenty of opportunities to invest capital internally and at ever higher rates, a combination that's common among multi-baggers.Our Take On Nucor's ROCEIn summary, it's great to see that Nucor can compound returns by consistently reinvesting capital at increasing rates of return, because these are some of the key ingredients of those highly sought after multi-baggers. And a remarkable 190% total return over the last five years tells us that investors are expecting more good things to come in the future. With that being said, we still think the promising fundamentals mean the company deserves some further due diligence.Story continuesIf you want to know some of the risks facing Nucor we've found 2 warning signs (1 is potentially serious!) that you should be aware of before investing here.If you want to search for more stocks that have been earning high returns, check out this free list of stocks with solid balance sheets that are also earning high returns on equity.Have feedback on this article?

AsheThank you, Charlotte, and good morning to all of you joining us. Our fiscal fourth quarter performance demonstrated excellent execution. Our focus on margin and cash generation led to increased adjusted operating profit margin and higher adjusted diluted earnings per share despite a decline in sales in the lighting business. This quarter concluded a successful year. We delivered strong financial performance. We continue to improve our businesses, and we allocated capital effectively. Throughout fiscal 2023, both our lighting and spaces teams made meaningful progress driving our business forward. In our Acuity Brands Lighting and Lighting Controls business, our strategy is to increase product vitality, improve service levels, use technology to improve and differentiate both our products and our services and to drive productivity. In 2023, we realigned our product portfolio through the introduction of Design Select. We now have 3 defined ways in which we go to market: Contractor Select, Design Select and Made to Order. By combining a high product vitality and improved service levels, Design Select allows us to better serve lighting specifiers, distributors and electrical contractors. The realignment of our portfolio, together with our ongoing product vitality efforts, has allowed us to strategically manage price in a dynamic environment, while the ongoing productivity improvements in our supply chain continue to improve our processes and manage our costs. We also continuously evaluate our portfolio. This year, that evaluation resulted in the divestiture of our Sunoptics daylighting business and the decision to exit Winona custom architectural lighting solutions. There's a bit of noise in the numbers this quarter, resulting from a series of actions. The first is the result of our ongoing transformation efforts. We have redefined our work, where and how it is done, resulting in organizational changes that will lead to more efficiencies. The second are charges primarily for impairment of trade names related to prior acquisitions. The third charge resulted from the collectibility of a supplier warranty obligation owed to us for components we use in products manufactured and sold between 2017 and 2019. Karen will cover each of these in more detail. This year, our teams have refreshed approximately 20% of our product portfolio and have introduced many new product families. I'd like to highlight our American Electric lighting brand, where we launched AutoConnect, which is a durable, value-driven solution for outdoor infrastructure lighting that includes connected luminaires for roadway, industrial and commercial applications. The rollout was targeted to coincide with the anticipated increase of infrastructure investments and positions us well for continued success. In August of this year, the City of Philadelphia announced that it has selected our American Electric Lighting outdoor lighting product as a major supplier for the Philadelphia Streetlight Improvement Project. The citywide project will replace and connect approximately 130,000 street lights into a network of more efficient, longer-lasting remotely controlled LED lights, which is expected to reduce street lighting energy usage by more than 50% and is expected to reduce municipal carbon emissions by more than 9%. Our team continued to be recognized for our innovation and the value that our products bring to our customers. In the fourth quarter, 6 of our lighting solutions were selected for the 2023 Illuminating Engineering Society Progress Report, which showcases the year's most significant advancements in the art and science of lighting, including our warm dim technology for Aculux, emergency battery backup cylinders from Gotham, and flame lighting technique from Hydrel. Our marketing team was also announced as a winner of the Best of the Best Marketing Award for 2023 by the Electrical Distributor Magazine. Now moving to spaces, where we had another great year. The strategy for our Intelligent Spaces business is to make spaces smarter, safer and greener by connecting the edge to the cloud. Distech has the best edge control devices on the market, and Atrius will be the best in cloud applications. Our strategic priority for Distech is to expand our addressable market in 2 ways. The first is geographic, and the second is increasing what we control in a built space. In 2023, we continue to drive this strategy forward by establishing a presence in the U.K. market and through the acquisition of KE2 Therm, which added commercial refrigeration controls to our portfolio. The integration of KE2 Therm is progressing well, and we rounded out a successful year with them being awarded a 2023 Dealer Design Award. Earlier this year, we launched Atrius Data Lab, the intersection point between the edge devices and Distech and the applications in the cloud. Atrius Data Lab is a foundational to our ability to automate the environment of a built space and help ensure that our partners achieve their specific energy and sustainability goals. During the quarter, Atrius was named as a Sustainability Leadership Award winner in the 2023 Sustainability Awards program. The program honors people, teams and organizations who have made sustainability an integral part of their business practice or overall mission. I'm pleased with the progress we have made as a team in 2023. We have successfully positioned our company at the intersection of sustainability and technology, setting ourselves up for long-term growth by taking advantage of 2 of the most important megatrends: minimizing the impacts of climate change and maximizing the impacts of technology. Our ABL business continue to lead as the largest lighting and lighting controls company in North America. And we have made the business more predictable, repeatable and scalable by focusing on product vitality, improving service levels, the use of technology throughout the business and driving productivity. Our spaces business continued to grow as an attractive technology business that connects the edge to the cloud for built spaces. Distech has a significant technology advantage that we can continue to expand as the mechanical and analog controls of today become digital over time. And Atrius introduced new applications in the cloud that are already making a difference for our customers. We have changed how the company works for a better, smarter, faster operating system. Better, smarter, faster is the combination of processes, tools and ways of working that spans from strategy to people to operating rhythms to problem solving. It is unique to our organization and allows us to drive strategic alignment, manage change and deliver results. Our values are at the core of our culture and help create a shared purpose for achieving our company's strategic goals. We make decisions based on our values, and these values impact how we treat each other and how we serve our customers. The combination of better, smarter, faster and our values allows us to operate more efficiently with greater distribution of responsibility and accountability throughout the company. It is how we continue to improve our businesses and respond quickly and effectively to changing economic environments. The alignment of everyone in our organization through our value creation model, through our total rewards framework compounds that responsibility and accountability. Our associates understand how they contribute to our overall strategy. If you stop people in our company and ask them how we create value, they will answer we grow net sales, we turn those profits into cash, and we don't grow the balance sheet as fast. This year, we have continued to demonstrate that we are effective capital allocators. We have invested for growth in our current businesses through R&amp;D and capital expenditures. We've enhanced our portfolio through the exit of Sunoptics and the acquisition of KE2 Therm. We've maintained our dividend, and we've created a permanent shareholder value with approximately $1.3 billion in share repurchases since the beginning of the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020, which amounts to about 23% of the then shares outstanding. As we turn to our fiscal 2024, our strategic priorities remain the same. In our lighting business, we will continue to drive margin and cash flow. We expect roughly the same market conditions in lighting for the remainder of this calendar year, with the potential for some improvement in the next calendar year. We will continue to grow our Intelligence Spaces group in 3 ways: Geographically, by adding control planes and by delivering applications that make a difference in built spaces. We will continue the development of our better, smarter, faster operating system in order to improve our current businesses and those that we acquire in the future, and we will continue to allocate capital consistent with our priorities. Now I'll turn the call over to Karen, who will update you on our 2023 performance and provide more details about 2024.Karen J. HolcomThank you, Neil, and good morning to everyone on the call. We executed well throughout fiscal 2023. In a challenging sales environment in the lighting business, we improved our adjusted operating profit by $9 million year-over-year and generated cash flow from operations of $578 million. We continue to improve our businesses and allocated capital effectively. For total AYI, we generated net sales in the fourth quarter of approximately $1 billion, which was $100 million or 9% lower than the prior year as a result of the decline in net sales in our ABL business. This was partially offset by continued growth in the ISG business of 17% in the quarter. We continue to deliver year-over-year margin improvement. During the quarter, our adjusted operating profit was down year-over-year on lower sales, while we expanded adjusted operating profit margin to 16.1%, an increase of approximately 80 basis points from the prior year. The increase was driven largely by the significant improvement in our gross profit margin as we continue to strategically manage price and costs. During the quarter, our adjusted diluted earnings per share of $3.97 increased $0.02 or 1% over the prior year. In ABL, net sales were $944 million in the quarter, a decrease of 11% compared with the prior year, driven by declines across most of our channels, offset slightly by continued strong performance in our retail channel. ABL's adjusted operating profit decreased 2% to $159 million on lower net sales. And we delivered adjusted operating profit margin of 16.8%, a 150 basis point improvement over the prior year as we strategically managed price and input costs improved, particularly steel and inbound freight. As Neil mentioned at the beginning of the call, we also took several charges during the quarter that's primarily related to ABL. Taken together, these amounted to $35.5 million in nonrecurring pretax charges or $0.87 in diluted earnings per share. The first is a result of our ongoing transformation efforts and includes a charge of $6 million in severance as we realigned how we work. The second is a $16.5 million noncash impairment charge for a small investment and for certain trade names related to prior acquisitions. In addition, we transitioned several of those trade names from indefinite to definite lives to more accurately reflect their value. The third is a $13 million pretax noncash charge for the impairment of a receivable based on its collectibility. The receivable is from a supplier who owes us a warranty obligation related to the recovery of quality costs we have incurred for certain ABL outdoor lighting products manufactured and sold between 2017 and 2019. We are pursuing recovery from the supplier. ISG's net sales for the fourth quarter were $72 million, an increase of 17%, as Distech continued to win business across new and existing customers. This quarter, we also had a modest benefit from the acquisition of KE2 Therm. ISG's adjusted operating profit was $14 million, which was a decline of approximately 3% over the prior year as we continued to invest in the business for long-term growth. Now turning to our cash flow performance. We generated $578 million of cash flow from operating activities for the full year of fiscal 2023, an increase of $262 million over the prior year, driven largely by improvements in working capital. We've improved both days of inventory and accounts receivable compared to the end of fiscal 2022. In fiscal 2023, we invested $67 million in capital expenditures and allocated $269 million to repurchase approximately 1.6 million shares. Since the beginning of the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020, we have repurchased over 9 million shares at an average price of approximately $143 per share, which was funded by organic cash flow. I now want to spend a few minutes expanding on our outlook for 2024. Consistent with our 2023 guidance, we are going to provide annual guidance anchored around net sales and adjusted diluted EPS. We will also provide you with certain assumptions, which you can find in the supplemental presentation available on our website after the conclusion of this call. For full year fiscal 2024, our expectation is that net sales will be within the range of $3.7 billion and $4 billion for total AYI. This is based on the assumptions that ABL will deliver sales down low to mid-single digits as a result of conditions in the lighting macro environment. And ISG will continue to generate sales growth in the mid-teens as we continue to take share and expand geographically and into new control planes. We expect to deliver adjusted diluted earnings per share within the range of $13 to $14.50 for total AYI. Our capital allocation and priority -- our capital allocation priorities in 2024 are unchanged, and we will continue to focus on delivering margin and cash flow. In conclusion, we strategically managed price and cost and delivered margin growth at ABL. We continue to grow the Intelligent Spaces Group. We generated strong cash flow from operations and allocated capital effectively. We continue to improve the business through product and productivity improvements, and we continue to take the steps necessary to drive our transformation forward. Thank you for joining us today. I will now pass you over to the operator to take your questions.Question and Answer SessionOperator(Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from the line of Tim Wojs with Baird.Timothy Ronald WojsMaybe, Neil, just to start, anything from an environment perspective, just any color that you could maybe provide on kind of what you're seeing kind of in the end market demand environment, maybe the quoting environment today? And your comments maybe about calendar year '24 maybe being a bit better. Is that just kind of starting to cycle easier comparisons? Or is there something that you're kind of seeing from a visibility perspective that you'd call out?Neil M. AsheYes, thanks for the question. So first of all, we're really proud with our performance. We've obviously demonstrated that we can execute in this environment. And I wish the economy would line up with our fiscal year, but it doesn't. So the -- as we're looking forward to kind of our fiscal first quarter and the rest of this year, while the business is relatively consistent, it's pretty much choppy all over. So we feel good about kind of where we guided for the year given that. And we also feel like there's still strong kind of volume in each of our networks. So the C&amp;I network, obviously, is about 60% of the business. As Karen pointed out, the retail business has remained strong for us. The direct business has been comparatively strong for us. And as you can see in our channel, the OEM business is down, which is our sales to other lighting manufacturers. So taken together then, we feel like we're comfortable operating in this environment and we feel like we've got a responsible plan for 2024.Timothy Ronald WojsOkay. Okay. Good. And then just, Karen, just when you think about guidance, and I guess, high-level, sales down kind of low to mid-single digits. It's -- at least in ABL business, I think it's down 3% overall. And I think that the midpoint of the EPS range winds up being down 2%. Could you just maybe give us kind of the puts and takes or what to think about in terms of kind of managing maybe a down volume environment versus kind of keeping margins what appears to be pretty stable?Karen J. HolcomYes, sure. Thanks, Tim. So the guidance, just to reiterate, the guidance for the net sales range is $3.7 billion to $4 billion, and you'll see all this in the presentation. That does anticipate that lighting would be down low to mid-single digits as we discussed, kind of the continuation of the trends that Neil talked about just a moment ago. When we look at the margin that we expect to maintain, it's a solid plan. And we don't expect to stay kind of at the high levels that we are now, but we still expect to be able to strategically manage our product vitality, our service levels, our technology and productivity to continue to deliver strong performance that would land us in the EPS range of $13 and $14.50 for the year. I would just call out ISG, we're still predicting up to mid-teens in that business. So that's still going to continue to grow next year. The acquisition of KE2 Therm will be a benefit as well. So really, really pleased with the performance overall.OperatorOur next question comes from the line of Ryan Merkel from William Blair. Our next question comes from Joe O'Dea with Wells Fargo.Joseph John O'DeaI guess first question is just the sort of combination of sort of channel inventory management and then the macro. And so what you've seen over the course of the past few months, what you're anticipating through kind of the rest of this year in terms of any additional headwinds related to destock? Or is there a little bit of a transition where macro has gotten a little bit choppier, but destock gets a little bit less challenging.Neil M. AsheYes. So just for just a little bit of historical context as we kind of recreate FY '23, obviously, we burned through backlog through the first half of our fiscal 2023. We talked extensively through the remainder of the year at how lead times have compressed, and that's led to the destocking you referred to. We're now getting to a more normal relationship between order rate and shipment rate. So we're starting to, and that's what I was alluding to in the answer to Tim's question, we still -- we're comfortable operating in this environment. So I think what we are experiencing now are macro lighting trends. And unfortunately, we're in a period where people are just buying less lighting and lighting controls. I'll also highlight, though, that as Karen pointed out, the Intelligence basis group continues to grow mid-teens. So the portfolio of the business is expanding. At the same time, in both the Lighting business and the Spaces business, we've been able to layer in margin despite the decline in sales at ABL.Joseph John O'DeaGot it. And then on the cash side, I think another year of solid cash generation. You did less on the buyback side. You ended with cash in a pretty strong position. And so just any commentary around what you might be seeing on the M&amp;A pipeline side of things? Or is it kind of as you're monitoring may be a little bit choppier environment, the bias to hold a little bit more cash, how we should think about buyback posture in 2024?Karen J. HolcomYes. Thank you, Joe. You'll see in the presentation that we'll post, we've talked about some of the assumptions that reflect our cash priorities for next year. So our cash -- our capital allocation priorities are going to be the same. First to invest in our current businesses for growth; second, to invest in M&amp;A; third, to maintain our dividend; and fourth, will be share repurchases. And so at this point, we've repurchased about 23% of our shares since we started at the beginning of fiscal -- fourth quarter of fiscal 2020. And so we're looking at this upcoming year about $40 million to $60 million in share repurchases is what we would expect, and you'll see that in the presentation. And then, Neil, do you want to comment on?Neil M. AsheI'd just add a couple of things, Joe. First is, obviously, we have done, I think, a very -- an outstanding job of generating cash. So through layering in margin and aggressive management of our balance sheet and working capital, especially on the lighting side, we've demonstrated the ability to generate a significant amount of cash. Our priorities, as Karen outlined, are -- remain the same. We want to grow our business. And so -- but when the market presents us with opportunities, we will take advantage of those opportunities to repurchase shares. We've demonstrated since we've been here over the last 2.5 years that when the stock goes down, we buy more and when the stock goes up, we buy less. And -- but our focus and our priorities are in the order and Karen mentioned them. We want to grow our current business and we want to grow the platform through acquisitions. And we feel good about our opportunities in all of those. On the acquisition side, our priority is the -- is to continue to add to our Intelligence Spaces Group. We think that there are very interesting and in some cases, meaningful opportunities to expand there. And so that's where we're spending the most of our time. But we are also open for business on the lighting side to other specific opportunities.OperatorOur next question comes from the line of Chris Snyder with UBS.Christopher M. SnyderI wanted to ask about the ABL guide for 2024. And specifically, what we should expect in first half versus second half. So down low to mid-single for the year. I think Neil talked about pressure in the market through the end of this calendar year. So I would assume that the declines are steeper in the first half and then moderate in the back half. Is there any color about how we should be thinking about the slope of ABL in '24 as we're kind of working towards to that low to mid-single-digit decline?Neil M. AsheYes. So Chris, thanks for the question. I would guide you back to kind of historical sequential trends where obviously, on a sequential basis, we drop off from fourth quarter to first quarter and from first quarter to second quarter. And last year, in those same periods, we were still at inflated levels of backlog as we were burning through backlog. So then we get you to a more normal -- in our assumptions, gets you to a more normal cadence in the back half of the year.Christopher M. SnyderI appreciate that. So it sounds like maybe high single-digit type declines in the first half, if I run that seasonality. And certainly, we see how the comps in the back half get easier. And is the uplift in growth really just kind of a function of the comps getting a lot easier into the back half? Or is there also an assumption that the macro will become more supportive into the back half?Neil M. AsheSo our assumptions aren't relying on significant improvement on the -- from a macro environment. As I mentioned, we have returned to a more normal relationship between order intake and shipment rates. So we are -- and as I mentioned, we're comfortable executing in this environment. So I think what we are ultimately suggesting for fiscal 2024 is that the back half of the year, we end up kind of clearing all of the legacy impacts of the increased backlogs and all of the other supply chain things. And so we end up with a more normal year. I think if you were -- if the economy matched up with our fiscal year, which it has no interest in what our fiscal year is, then you would say -- you would notice the third and fourth quarters of fiscal 2023 and the first and second quarters of fiscal 2024 on a calendar basis. But that gets us to where we are, which is kind of where you suggest, which is we'll be down in ABL in the first half of the year, and it will normalize a little bit in the back.OperatorOur next question comes from the line of Brian Lee with Goldman Sachs.Unidentified AnalystThis is Grace on for Brian. I guess my first question, just to follow up on the last question. Sounds like you're expecting improvement. You called out the assumption of clearing all the legacy impact of the increased backlog. Just curious like what gives you the confidence to see that improvement? Are you seeing like sell-through improvement from quarter-over-quarter?Neil M. AsheYes, Grace, as I pointed out, we've returned in the lighting business to a more normal relationship between order intake and shipment rates within the quarter. So we are at normal lead times. So our lead times are in the 20- to 30-day range in our lighting business, which translates to a performance where orders and shipments are consistent. As I explained in response to Chris' question, the -- we were at this point in the last year for our fiscal first and second quarters in Lighting, we were burning through additional backlog. So we obviously are not burning through additional backlog anymore. So we have returned to a more normal correlation between order intake and shipment rate.Operator(Operator Instructions) Our next question comes from Jeff Osborne with TD Cowen.Jeffrey David OsborneJust, Neil, you mentioned several times, expanding geographically and control planes on the ISG side. Do you have any organic efforts there? You alluded to potentially meaningful M&amp;A activity there. I was just curious how to balance those 2 comments.Neil M. AsheSo that is basically all organic. So Distech continues to grow. We've called out the U.K. where we've had some success in that market, and we'll continue to expand in Asia over the course in Australia over the course of this year and beyond. So that is primarily organic growth. The acquisition that added to that would be KE2 Therm, which added refrigeration controls. So those are added. So we're confident in the organic cash, I mean, the organic growth at ISG any acquisitions we make would then be in addition to that, and we see some interesting opportunities there as well.Jeffrey David OsbornePerfect. And then either for you, Neil or Karen, what are the assumptions around price and volume mix as it relates to the revenue guidance for the year?Neil M. AsheYes. I'll take that one, Jeff. So as Karen has explained through the course of this year, volume was -- we had a healthy mix in fiscal 2023 first half of both volume and price. That was, again, as we were burning through the backlog. Through the back half of this year, we have delivered performance largely through price as volumes have moderated. So on a sequential basis, we feel pretty decent on the relationship between volume and price. So we think we're in a healthy balance of both of those for -- in our lighting guidance for 2024. They are -- the volume is impacting and we're comfortable with where we are in price.OperatorOur next question comes from the line of Jeffrey Sprague with Vertical Research Partners.Jeffrey Todd SpragueCan we just follow up a little bit back to what you just said on price. So if I understand, you're saying most of the revenue decline that we see in the quarter is price. Is that what you meant? Could you just kind of clarify?Neil M. AsheYes. Sorry, if I left with that impression, that was not what I intended to say. So I was talking about fiscal '24 in response to other Jeff's question, which was -- and so how we how we got to our net sales assumptions for the lighting business next year.Jeffrey Todd SpragueGot it. And then if I recall, you haven't actually made a major pricing move for the better part of the year. Is that correct? And do you have additional pricing actions in the market at this point in time?Neil M. AsheSo as we've mentioned consistently, Jeff, we have -- our strategy, the underlying strategy of product vitality, service, technology and productivity has afforded us the opportunity to more strategically manage price. So while there were a number of broad pricing actions through kind of '22 and '23, we've become significantly more targeted in those actions now. So for example, we're in the market now. We just recently announced a price increase around certain controls products this quarter. The -- we're also strategic about where we choose to invest in price. That's generally in the Contractor Select portfolio, and it's generally to expand our market share in the electrical distribution channel. And it's highly targeted. So it's very low dollars comparative investment on a percentage basis. So the strategy has empowered us to more strategically manage price. And so we are no longer really going after broad-based pricing changes like that up and down, but more strategically managing on different categories and for different reasons.Jeffrey Todd SpragueAnd then maybe just one last one. So the cash flow was solid in '23. By my math, the inventory days are actually now a fair amount below normal. Can you do more on inventory or working capital at this point? Maybe just a little some thoughts on cash outlook for 2024.Karen J. HolcomYes, I think as we look ahead, Jeff, I agree, we had a really good performance this year with our cash flow generation, and we were able to improve our days. I think there's still some opportunity as we look ahead, probably not to the magnitude of what you see in -- or what we saw in 2023. So for example, if you think about where we were in '22, we had high levels of inventory because of lead times from our suppliers. We were able to bring that down to a little bit better than our normal levels of inventory. But I think as we continue to drive the strategy, particularly at ABL, around product vitality, service, technology and productivity, there is still room for some improvement as we kind of drive that strategy throughout the business.Neil M. AsheAnd Jeff, I'd love to take this opportunity to summarize kind of where I think we are from a performance perspective. Obviously, it's hard to increase margins when sales are declining. We've demonstrated that we can do that. It's also hard to make the kind of improvements that we've demonstrated and you highlighted from a working capital perspective, we've structurally improved the business. The strategy, as Karen outlined, has changed, both where we -- how we operate and how successfully we can operate. So that makes us very comfortable with our continuing performance around margin and cash generation.OperatorOur next question comes from the line of Joe O'Dea with Wells Fargo.Joseph John O'DeaI just want to circle back to the kind of sequential commentary. So it seems like if we run sort of normal seasonality out of the fourth quarter kind of revenue rate, we get roughly to the midpoint. I guess that also would seem to imply that you're going from an environment where you were dealing with channel inventory rationalization that ends. And so arguably, there should be an uplift and maybe the incremental pressures that the macro is a little bit more challenging. And so just wanted to sort of touch on that dynamic again a little bit more. And then within that, I think a tremendous amount of focus on sort of verticals within non-res and so any additional commentary sort of on thoughts that you have around kind of verticals that would be stronger where you're maybe paying a little bit closer attention to any potential softness.Neil M. AsheYes, Joe, thanks for the follow-up. So again, we would like to provide you as much of a read through the macro as we can, but we can only kind of comment really on our performance. And so as it relates to that, as just to kind of reiterate, in the first half of fiscal 2023, we were burning through backlog. We have now returned to a more normal order and relationship between order and shipment rates, where our order rate is -- it drives basically the shipments within the quarter, and we're at kind of a 20- to 30-day lead times, so average lead time in the lighting business. So things are relatively back to normal. So on a sequential basis, that's how you see the more traditional sequential seasonality play out. So as we look forward, I'd like to say we know more about the macro environment than others. The advantage, but we -- I don't think we do. The advantage we have is that our portfolio on the lighting side really addresses the -- wherever there can be growth in the marketplace. So the product vitality efforts that we have undertaken, the service levels we have undertaken allows us to be strong in retail, strong in electrical distribution, strong in each of the categories, well positioned for infrastructure. So we are in the places where we can benefit from any changes in the lighting market. In the meantime, we're comfortable operating at these kind of levels of market activity and continuing to deliver the margins and the cash flow that Karen effectively highlighted through the guidance.OperatorOur next question comes from the line of Chris Snyder with UBS.Christopher M. SnyderI just wanted to ask on gross margin. I don't believe this has come up. Can you just talk about what level of gross margin is implied in the guide next year as we're going from $3.7 billion to $4 billion of revenue to that $30 million, $40 million, $50 million of earnings?Neil M. AsheYes, sure. Chris, I'll take that. The -- as Karen pointed out, the -- all we are guiding to is net sales and adjusted EPS. I'm confident in your math skill, so you'll quickly realize that, that implies that we are -- we don't need to be at the levels of margin we were in the fourth quarter to -- for the full year next year to deliver that range. What it does say, though, is that, as I was responding to Jeff Sprague earlier, we have structurally improved this business, which allows us to operate at higher margins than the company has operated in the past. It's worth saying that the fourth quarter gross profit margins are the highest in the history of the company. So we don't have to maintain those levels to continue to deliver what we consider to be outstanding performance. And further, as I have pointed out repeatedly, the -- and our value creation model is about growing net sales, turning profits into cash and not growing the balance sheet as fast. So we've made structural changes, which allow us to operate at these higher margin levels and to turn those margins into cash. So we feel really good about kind of the permanence of the changes that we've made in the Lighting business and the continued opportunity we have to improve that. At the same time, we can continue to grow the portfolio through ISG and then through adding additional businesses to the portfolio.Christopher M. SnyderI really appreciate that. And if I could follow up with 1 more, and it's probably the biggest question that I get, is when we look at this gross margin, I mean it's pretty incredible, up 340 basis points versus the start of the year. But at the same time, volumes have rolled. I understand that there's the backlog dynamic. I understand maybe the macro is a bit softer. But do you guys think that there is any negative volume impact from this big uplift in gross margin? And how does the company think about balancing that? It feels like there's a bit of maybe a sliding scale dynamic.Neil M. AsheYes. No, I appreciate you asking the question and giving us the opportunity to address it. We talked a bit about this in the third quarter call. But I want to reflect on it some more, which is most importantly, our strategy in the lighting business around biotic vitality, service technology and productivity has put us in a position to manage price and to manage margins in a step function better way than we have in the past. And so we feel really good about that. As we have evaluated volumes, and I was addressing this with Jeff's question, we strategically managed price where we choose to where we think we can drive volume. We realize that at these margin levels, we've created a significant amount of value. And so we have a lot of incentive to continue to operate at these margin levels. All of the data that we are looking at across verticals says that we are appropriately pricing for the volume that's available in the market. And that's our goal over time. So we will -- that's why we've continued to layer in margin and cash flow during this low volume period and why we believe we're well positioned for the inevitable return of volume growth at some point in the future.OperatorAnd I'm showing no further questions in queue at this time. I'd like to turn the call back to Neil Ashe for any closing remarks.Neil M. AsheFirst of all, thank you all for spending some time with us this morning. We're really proud of our financial performance, as we've talked about through the call. We had a great year. We delivered strong financial performance. We continue to structurally improve both the lighting business, and we continue to grow the Intelligence Spaces Group, and we can allocate capital effectively. Our priorities for next year remain the same. We're going to continue to focus on operating excellence in the lighting business and making it more predictable, repeatable and scalable. We'll continue to grow the Spaces business, and we will be consistent with our capital allocation priorities. So we look forward to being back together with you at the end of the quarter, and hope you have a good rest of your day. Thank you for your interest in Acuity Brands.OperatorThis concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.]"

ARE recently announced that it has expedited the delivery of 325 Binney Street, a 462,100 rentable square feet (RSF) Class A+ property presently under construction, to Moderna MRNA.Strategically located on the Alexandria Center® at One Kendall Square mega campus in Cambridge, Moderna’s new global headquarters and core R&amp;D operations center is expected to be handed over in November 2023.Moreover, Alexandria is likely to deliver the mission-critical development project under budget. This will contribute significantly to its incremental annual net operating income (NOI) beginning from the fourth quarter of 2023, which is encouraging.The state-of-the-art facility integrates leading-edge laboratory and non-scientific space with engaging gathering spaces to foster collaboration and disruptive innovation. Given this favorable setup, Moderna’s research pipeline of mRNA medicines that leverage its paradigm-shifting mRNA technology to address a wide range of diseases, including COVID-19, is likely to play a key role in supporting the company’s growth.Per Hunter L. Kass, co-president and regional market director – Greater Boston of Alexandria Real Estate Equities, Inc., “Moderna is an exceptional example of a transformative company that has grown with Alexandria over many years, and we are immensely proud to have been able to accelerate delivery of their mission-critical infrastructure at 325 Binney Street.”Speaking of the sustainability aspect of the ultra-efficient building, 325 Binney Street is aiming for a 92% reduction in fossil fuel use by implementing a geothermal system and 100% renewable electricity to result in an estimated 97% emissions reduction. It is also targeting LEED Zero Energy, LEED Platinum Core &amp; Shell, Fitwel Life Science and WiredScore Platinum certifications.Further, the building features several wellness amenities, including walking paths and open outdoor areas, keeping in mind the physical and mental well-being of the workers.Alongside this announcement, ARE was conferred the Cambridge Chamber of Commerce's 2023 Visionary Award for developing this highly sustainable and inspiring facility for Moderna. The prestigious award is given to innovators from the business, institutional and non-profit communities that are bringing about a change and making extraordinary positive impact on people's lives in Cambridge and beyond.Alexandria owns Class A/A+ properties in North America's AAA innovation cluster locations, with significant market presence in Greater Boston, San Francisco Bay Area, New York City, San Diego, Seattle, Maryland and the Research Triangle. The advantageous locations of its properties are driving demand, resulting in high occupancy levels.Moreover, ARE is making concerted efforts to acquire, develop and redevelop new Class A/A+ properties in AAA locations to enhance its operating platform. From the beginning of 2023 through Jul 24, the company completed acquisitions with development/redevelopment opportunities worth $235.4 million. Also, in the six months ended Jun 30, 2023, the company placed into service development and redevelopment projects totaling 840,587 RSF across multiple submarkets, which resulted in $81 million of incremental annual NOI.As of Jun 30, 2023, its highly leased value-creation pipeline is expected to generate future annual incremental NOI of around $605 million through the second quarter of 2026.With a solid balance sheet position and ample financial flexibility, ARE seems well-positioned to capitalize on long-term growth opportunities.Nonetheless, persistent macroeconomic uncertainty and high interest rates pose near-term concerns.Shares of this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company have lost 16.9% in the past three months compared with the industry’s decline of 14.1%.Story continuesZacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchStocks to ConsiderSome better-ranked stocks from the real estate investment trust sector are Welltower WELL and Americold Realty Trust COLD, each carrying a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) at present.

This company, which is in the Zacks Insurance - Accident and Health industry, shows potential for another earnings beat.When looking at the last two reports, this insurance company has recorded a strong streak of surpassing earnings estimates. The company has topped estimates by 11.75%, on average, in the last two quarters.For the last reported quarter, Unum came out with earnings of $2.06 per share versus the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.87 per share, representing a surprise of 10.16%. For the previous quarter, the company was expected to post earnings of $1.65 per share and it actually produced earnings of $1.87 per share, delivering a surprise of 13.33%.For Unum, estimates have been trending higher, thanks in part to this earnings surprise history. And when you look at the stock's positive Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction), it's a great indicator of a future earnings beat, especially when combined with its solid Zacks Rank.Our research shows that stocks with the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time. In other words, if you have 10 stocks with this combination, the number of stocks that beat the consensus estimate could be as high as seven.The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is related to change. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Unum currently has an Earnings ESP of +0.71%, which suggests that analysts have recently become bullish on the company's earnings prospects. This positive Earnings ESP when combined with the stock's Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) indicates that another beat is possibly around the corner. We expect the company's next earnings report to be released on October 31, 2023.Story continuesInvestors should note, however, that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss, but a negative value does reduce the predictive power of this metric.Many companies end up beating the consensus EPS estimate, but that may not be the sole basis for their stocks moving higher. On the other hand, some stocks may hold their ground even if they end up missing the consensus estimate.Because of this, it's really important to check a company's Earnings ESP ahead of its quarterly release to increase the odds of success.

14,8ae90827-b37b-3b9a-84dd-5da005e56fd4,UNM,2023-10-05,Why Unum (UNM) is a Top Dividend Stock for Your Portfolio,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/why-unum-unm-top-dividend-154506800.html,1696434306,STORY,['UNM'],"[All investors love getting big returns from their portfolio, whether it's through stocks, bonds, ETFs, or other types of securities. However, when you're an income investor, your primary focus is generating consistent cash flow from each of your liquid investments.While cash flow can come from bond interest or interest from other types of investments, income investors hone in on dividends. A dividend is that coveted distribution of a company's earnings paid out to shareholders, and investors often view it by its dividend yield, a metric that measures the dividend as a percent of the current stock price. Many academic studies show that dividends account for significant portions of long-term returns, with dividend contributions exceeding one-third of total returns in many cases.Unum in FocusUnum (UNM) is headquartered in Chattanooga, and is in the Finance sector. The stock has seen a price change of 17.26% since the start of the year. The insurance company is paying out a dividend of $0.37 per share at the moment, with a dividend yield of 3.03% compared to the Insurance - Accident and Health industry's yield of 2.72% and the S&amp;P 500's yield of 1.75%.Taking a look at the company's dividend growth, its current annualized dividend of $1.46 is up 15.9% from last year. In the past five-year period, Unum has increased its dividend 4 times on a year-over-year basis for an average annual increase of 5.82%. Future dividend growth will depend on earnings growth as well as payout ratio, which is the proportion of a company's annual earnings per share that it pays out as a dividend. Right now, Unum's payout ratio is 19%, which means it paid out 19% of its trailing 12-month EPS as dividend.UNM is expecting earnings to expand this fiscal year as well. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2023 is $7.73 per share, representing a year-over-year earnings growth rate of 24.48%.Bottom LineFrom greatly improving stock investing profits and reducing overall portfolio risk to providing tax advantages, investors like dividends for a variety of different reasons. It's important to keep in mind that not all companies provide a quarterly payout.Story continuesBig, established firms that have more secure profits are often seen as the best dividend options, but it's fairly uncommon to see high-growth businesses or tech start-ups offer their stockholders a dividend. Income investors must be conscious of the fact that high-yielding stocks tend to struggle during periods of rising interest rates. With that in mind, UNM is a compelling investment opportunity.

Of course, one figure often stands out among the rest: earnings.The earnings figure itself is key, but a beat or miss on the bottom line can sometimes be just as, if not more, important. Therefore, investors should consider paying close attention to these earnings surprises, as a big beat can help a stock climb even higher.2 Stocks to Add to Your WatchlistThe Zacks Expected Surprise Prediction, or ESP, works by locking in on the most up-to-date analyst earnings revisions because they can be more accurate than estimates from weeks or even months before the actual release date. The thinking is pretty straightforward: analysts who provide earnings estimates closer to the report are likely to have more information. With this in mind, the Expected Surprise Prediction compares the Most Accurate Estimate (being the most recent) against the overall Zacks Consensus Estimate. The percentage difference provides the ESP figure.The final step today is to look at a stock that meets our ESP qualifications. Unum (UNM) earns a Zacks Rank #3 27 days from its next quarterly earnings release on October 31, 2023, and its Most Accurate Estimate comes in at $1.93 a share.By taking the percentage difference between the $1.93 Most Accurate Estimate and the $1.92 Zacks Consensus Estimate, Unum has an Earnings ESP of 0.71%.UNM is just one of a large group of Finance stocks with a positive ESP figure. First Citizens BancShares (FCNCA) is another qualifying stock you may want to consider.Slated to report earnings on October 26, 2023, First Citizens BancShares holds a #1 (Strong Buy) ranking on the Zacks Rank, and it's Most Accurate Estimate is $50.84 a share 22 days from its next quarterly update.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for First Citizens BancShares is $48.20, and when you take the percentage difference between that number and its Most Accurate Estimate, you get the Earnings ESP figure of 5.48%.Story continuesUNM and FCNCA's positive ESP figures tell us that both stocks have a good chance at beating analyst expectations in their next earnings report.Find Stocks to Buy or Sell Before They're ReportedUse the Zacks Earnings ESP Filter to turn up stocks with the highest probability of positively, or negatively, surprising to buy or sell before they're reported for profitable earnings season trading.

We also reviewed year to date performance of 15 stocks billionaire Seth Klarman likes the most now. You can skip our detailed discussion about Seth Klarman and jump directly to 5 Stocks Billionaire Seth Klarman Likes the Most Now.When the S&amp;P 500 was trading at a 52-week high two months ago, billionaire Seth Klarman, a renowned value investor and founder of Baupost Group, predicted that the markets were still in a bubble caused by ultra-low interest rates during pandemic years. His prediction is turning out to be true as the S&amp;P 500 has plunged nearly 7% since Klarman presented a bearish outlook for the US stock market in an interview with Ted Seides of Capital Allocators. The robust uptrend of the US stock market has been halted by the Fed's hawkish stance, an increase in inflation, and lofty valuations.""You had a bubble, it was really a credit bubble, that became an everything bubble. Super-low interest rates, at times zero rates, made capital easily available and incredibly cheap. That led to startup manias and SPACs and meme stocks and crypto, all kinds of speculative activity. I'm not convinced that we've even begun to sort out that bubble,"" the billionaire investor said in an interview with Capital Allocators. After reaching a 2023 high of 4500 points in July and surging 19%, the broader US stock market index fell back to 4200 points in the following two months as investor sentiment was harmed by the Fed's strategy of keeping rates higher for longer in order to keep inflation at 2%. According to the Fed's dot plot, there will be one more rate hike in 2023 and two fewer cuts in 2024, compared to expectations for no rate hikes in 2023 and four cuts in 2024. High interest rates already jolted the financial sector in early 2023, when several regional banks failed. The Fed's strategy of keeping rates higher for a longer time would exacerbate difficulties for the financial sector. Higher rates for a longer time will support deposit flight to market funds with higher yields. High rates also deter the growth potential of the technology and other growth sectors. Story continuesIn another interview following the publication of his edited version of Benjamin Graham's and David Dodd's Security Analysis, widely regarded as the bible of value investing, Klarman advised retail and institutional investors to revisit Security Analysis. He explained in an interview that he edited the book to emphasize how crucial it is to abide by fundamental principles of investing in order to avoid volatility. He added that it is his duty to alert investors about the risks because speculative trading has gained significant traction in the last 15 years. He does, however, think that the largest endowments and pension funds might choose to ignore his advice.“I don’t know how much of this will be read by institutional investors who may think they know it all.”Seth Klarman's investment strategy and principles are worth considering because he grew his small $27 million fund into one of the world's largest hedge funds, earning a compound annual average return of 20% since inception. His hedge fund's stellar performance earned him the title ""the Oracle of Boston."" In fact, Warren Buffett of Berkshire Hathaway once said that one book he reads almost daily is Seth Klarman's ""Margin of Safety."" Klarman’s hedge fund mainly invests in stocks, distressed debt, and foreign securities. The renowned investor typically looks for undervalued securities and then he waits for the price to increase with a long-term horizon. According to the Baupost Group's second quarter 13F Filings, billionaire Seth Klarman's $5.6 billion stock portfolio underwent a number of changes. His fund added four new positions while increasing or decreasing the number of its existing positions. Additionally, the hedge fund unloaded six stocks. The Baupost Group's stock portfolio is well-diversified, with stocks primarily from the communication, technology, healthcare, industrial, and financial sectors. The fund’s largest stock holdings include Union Pacific Corporation (NYSE:UNP), Dollar General Corporation (NYSE:DG), Jazz Pharmaceuticals plc (NASDAQ:JAZZ), Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), New Oriental Education &amp; Technology Group Inc. (NYSE:EDU), Garrett Motion Inc. (NASDAQ:GTX), Willis Towers Watson Public Limited Company (NASDAQ:WTW), SS&amp;C Technologies Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:SSNC), Qorvo, Inc. (NASDAQ:QRVO) and Warner Bros. Discovery, Inc.

Additionally, we saw the negative impacts of lower-than-expected tax refunds and reductions in the Federal Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP). Dollar General remained committed to spending on customer experience and investing in price to help their customers through the tougher economic environment, as a result, reducing the earnings guidance by a greater amount than the sales reductions.”8. Jazz Pharmaceuticals plc (NASDAQ:JAZZ)Value of Baupost Group’s 13F Position: $83 million Number of Hedge Fund Shareholders: 45Similar to Dollar General Corporation (NYSE:DG) and Union Pacific Corporation (NYSE:UNP), Baupost Group has used the decline in the share price of Jazz Pharmaceuticals plc (NASDAQ:JAZZ) as a buying opportunity.

We believe Amazon’s competitive advantages will continue to grow and that the business has the potential to grow faster than the overall economy in the coming years.”6. New Oriental Education &amp; Technology Group Inc. (NYSE:EDU) Value of Baupost Group’s 13F Position: $162 million Number of Hedge Fund Shareholders: 26So far in 2023, billionaire Seth Klarman’s Baupost Group benefited from its stake in New Oriental Education &amp; Technology Group Inc.

(NYSE:EDU): We made a new investment in New Oriental last fall. Outside of one-on-one discussions with some partners, I’ve never discussed the investment in-depth before. The reason for this is that I simply because thought there wasn’t much to say.The thesis at the time was extremely simple – the company was trading below the net cash value on its balance sheet, while I believed the on-going operations would soon return to profitable growth. As such, I believed the market was being overly pessimistic about the company’s future prospects, and the shares would re-value once the on-going education business returned to a surer financial footing.Partners will notice that unlike a typical Hayden investment, this is more emblematic of a “special-situations” / event-driven thesis. Our thesis is dependent upon a specific catalyst &amp; subsequent change in the market’s perception, more so than the longer-term attractiveness of the company’s operations. I expect our holding period will be shorter than our typical investments, for this reason…” (Click here to read the full text)5. Garrett Motion Inc.

17,00eba7ea-02bc-3403-8cf3-7df7586b9ca6,TMO,2023-10-05,Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc.'s (NYSE:TMO) Intrinsic Value Is Potentially 35% Above Its Share Price,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/thermo-fisher-scientific-inc-nyse-120041205.html,1696507241,STORY,['TMO'],"[Key InsightsThermo Fisher Scientific's estimated fair value is US$681 based on 2 Stage Free Cash Flow to EquityThermo Fisher Scientific's US$502 share price signals that it might be 26% undervalued Analyst price target for TMO is US$621 which is 8.8% below our fair value estimateIn this article we are going to estimate the intrinsic value of Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc. (NYSE:TMO) by taking the expected future cash flows and discounting them to today's value. One way to achieve this is by employing the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model. Models like these may appear beyond the comprehension of a lay person, but they're fairly easy to follow.Companies can be valued in a lot of ways, so we would point out that a DCF is not perfect for every situation. If you still have some burning questions about this type of valuation, take a look at the Simply Wall St analysis model. Check out our latest analysis for Thermo Fisher Scientific Crunching The NumbersWe are going to use a two-stage DCF model, which, as the name states, takes into account two stages of growth. The first stage is generally a higher growth period which levels off heading towards the terminal value, captured in the second 'steady growth' period. To begin with, we have to get estimates of the next ten years of cash flows. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.A DCF is all about the idea that a dollar in the future is less valuable than a dollar today, so we need to discount the sum of these future cash flows to arrive at a present value estimate:Story continues10-year free cash flow (FCF) forecast2024202520262027202820292030203120322033 Levered FCF ($, Millions) US$8.52bUS$9.31bUS$10.7bUS$12.3bUS$13.4bUS$14.3bUS$15.1bUS$15.8bUS$16.4bUS$17.0bGrowth Rate Estimate SourceAnalyst x9Analyst x9Analyst x3Analyst x2Est @ 9.17%Est @ 7.06%Est @ 5.59%Est @ 4.56%Est @ 3.83%Est @ 3.33% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 7.1% US$8.0kUS$8.1kUS$8.8kUS$9.3kUS$9.5kUS$9.5kUS$9.4kUS$9.2kUS$8.9kUS$8.6k(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$89bWe now need to calculate the Terminal Value, which accounts for all the future cash flows after this ten year period. The Gordon Growth formula is used to calculate Terminal Value at a future annual growth rate equal to the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield of 2.2%. We discount the terminal cash flows to today's value at a cost of equity of 7.1%.Terminal Value (TV)= FCF2033 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$17b× (1 + 2.2%) ÷ (7.1%– 2.2%) = US$351bPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$351b÷ ( 1 + 7.1%)10= US$177bThe total value is the sum of cash flows for the next ten years plus the discounted terminal value, which results in the Total Equity Value, which in this case is US$266b. In the final step we divide the equity value by the number of shares outstanding. Relative to the current share price of US$502, the company appears a touch undervalued at a 26% discount to where the stock price trades currently. The assumptions in any calculation have a big impact on the valuation, so it is better to view this as a rough estimate, not precise down to the last cent.dcfThe AssumptionsNow the most important inputs to a discounted cash flow are the discount rate, and of course, the actual cash flows. If you don't agree with these result, have a go at the calculation yourself and play with the assumptions. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Thermo Fisher Scientific as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 7.1%, which is based on a levered beta of 0.988. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.SWOT Analysis for Thermo Fisher ScientificStrengthDebt is well covered by earnings and cashflows.WeaknessEarnings declined over the past year.Dividend is low compared to the top 25% of dividend payers in the Life Sciences market.OpportunityAnnual earnings are forecast to grow faster than the American market.Trading below our estimate of fair value by more than 20%.ThreatAnnual revenue is forecast to grow slower than the American market.Moving On:Whilst important, the DCF calculation ideally won't be the sole piece of analysis you scrutinize for a company. The DCF model is not a perfect stock valuation tool. Rather it should be seen as a guide to ""what assumptions need to be true for this stock to be under/overvalued?"" If a company grows at a different rate, or if its cost of equity or risk free rate changes sharply, the output can look very different.

The underlying strength of the agricultural market and attractive farm economics are spurring demand for fertilizers globally.Industry players such as CF Industries Holdings, Inc. CF, ICL Group Ltd ICL and Intrepid Potash, Inc. IPI are poised to gain from higher demand for fertilizers in the major markets. While weak fertilizer prices pose headwinds, factors like healthy farm income and expectations of increased planted acres are expected to drive crop nutrient demand globally in the near term.  About the IndustryThe Zacks Fertilizers industry comprises producers, distributors and marketers of crop nutrients for the global agriculture industry. Companies in this space offer nutrients such as phosphates (including diammonium phosphate, monoammonium phosphate and phosphoric acid), potash and nitrogen (including urea, ammonia and urea ammonium nitrate) fertilizers. They also provide other nitrogen products to help farmers maximize crop yield. Crop nutrients are essential to drive agricultural productivity and the natural fertility of the soil. Demand for these nutrients is being supported by the need to increase the production of grains to address rising food consumption globally. Moreover, the constant need of growers to nourish their crops, replenish nutrients in the soil following a harvest and boost yields to feed a growing global population boosts the consumption of fertilizers.What's Shaping the Future of the Fertilizers Industry?Strong Demand for Crop Nutrients: The companies in the fertilizers space are well-placed to benefit from strong global demand for major crop nutrients. In the United States, healthy farm profits and high levels of planted acreage are expected to drive demand for fertilizers. Strong farmer economics are also expected to support demand in major markets such as Brazil and India. The phosphate market is benefiting from higher global demand and low producer and channel inventories. Strong grower economics and healthy crop commodity prices are also expected to drive potash demand globally. Demand for nitrogen fertilizer also remains healthy in major markets. High levels of corn planted acres should drive demand for nitrogen in North America. Moreover, demand for urea imports remains favorable in Brazil and India.Agricultural Fundamentals Remain Favorable: While the coronavirus pandemic stung a vast spectrum of industries, agriculture was relatively unscathed, given the sustained rise in food demand globally. Moreover, strong global demand coupled with supply constraints boosted crop commodity prices. Higher freight, energy and labor costs and raw material shortages contributed to the upside. Prices of corn, soybean and wheat rallied to multi-year highs last year, partly driven by supply worries stemming from Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and are likely to remain elevated due to lingering concerns over the war. Farmer economics also remain attractive in most global growing regions on strong crop demand. Expectations of high levels of planted corn and soybean acres globally also suggest a pickup in fertilizer demand.        Weaker Fertilizer Prices a Concern: Fertilizer prices surged to historic high levels in the first half of 2022, riding on the impacts of the war in Ukraine that led grain prices shooting to record levels and export curtailments in China to meet domestic demand. Disruptions due to the sanctions in Belarus also contributed to the spike. However, prices of phosphate and potash retreated in the back half of the year from their peak levels as farmers reduced application rates due to affordability issues. Escalating costs led to growers reducing fertilizer applications or switching to less fertilizer-intensive crops. Global nitrogen prices have declined since the beginning of 2023. Higher global supply availability driven by higher global operating rates has resulted in a decline in prices. While fertilizer prices have stabilized somewhat of late, weaker year-over-year prices are likely to dent the profitability of companies in this space over the near term.Story continuesZacks Industry Rank Reflects Upbeat ProspectsThe Zacks Fertilizers industry is part of the broader Zacks Basic Materials sector.

Of course, one figure often stands out among the rest: earnings.The earnings figure itself is key, but a beat or miss on the bottom line can sometimes be just as, if not more, important. Therefore, investors should consider paying close attention to these earnings surprises, as a big beat can help a stock climb even higher.2 Stocks to Add to Your WatchlistThe Zacks Expected Surprise Prediction, or ESP, works by locking in on the most up-to-date analyst earnings revisions because they can be more accurate than estimates from weeks or even months before the actual release date. The thinking is pretty straightforward: analysts who provide earnings estimates closer to the report are likely to have more information. With this in mind, the Expected Surprise Prediction compares the Most Accurate Estimate (being the most recent) against the overall Zacks Consensus Estimate. The percentage difference provides the ESP figure.Now that we understand what the ESP is and how beneficial it can be, let's dive into a stock that currently fits the bill. Stanley Black &amp; Decker (SWK) earns a Zacks Rank #3 right now and its Most Accurate Estimate sits at $0.85 a share, just 23 days from its upcoming earnings release on October 27, 2023.SWK has an Earnings ESP figure of 3.2%, which, as explained above, is calculated by taking the percentage difference between the $0.85 Most Accurate Estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $0.82.SWK is part of a big group of Industrial Products stocks that boast a positive ESP, and investors may want to take a look at Cintas (CTAS) as well.Slated to report earnings on December 20, 2023, Cintas holds a #3 (Hold) ranking on the Zacks Rank, and it's Most Accurate Estimate is $3.49 a share 77 days from its next quarterly update.For Cintas, the percentage difference between its Most Accurate Estimate and its Zacks Consensus Estimate of $3.48 is 0.12%.Story continuesBecause both stocks hold a positive Earnings ESP, SWK and CTAS could potentially post earnings beats in their next reports.Find Stocks to Buy or Sell Before They're ReportedUse the Zacks Earnings ESP Filter to turn up stocks with the highest probability of positively, or negatively, surprising to buy or sell before they're reported for profitable earnings season trading.

During a demo with TechCrunch, a company spokesperson outlined how the retail giant is experimenting with generative AI to help shoppers in all stages of the shopping experience, from the search and discovery phase to making a purchase. Three features coming down the pipeline include a shopping assistant, generative AI-powered search and an interior design feature.Walmart declined to share which AI models it’s using to develop these features, but says it’s using a variety of different external models and they may change over time.“Other companies are essentially locking themselves into working with Anthropic or OpenAI,” the spokesperson told us. “We want to have that flexibility to put in and out different models.”Image Credits: WalmartThe new shopping assistant -- which is launching in the coming weeks -- will allow customers to have a more interactive and conversational experience as it can answer specific questions, provide personalized product suggestions and share detailed information about a certain product. For instance, it can give shoppers Halloween costume ideas to wear to a horror-themed party or which cell phone a parent should buy for their child.Similarly, users will soon be able to enter specific questions directly in the search bar. With the use of generative AI, Walmart’s search tool can understand context and generate a collection of items relevant to one query. For example, if a customer wants to plan for a unicorn-themed birthday, the AI displays a wide array of products such as balloons, paper napkins, streamers and so on. Instead of having to type in numerous separate searches, Walmart’s new AI search tool is designed to save customers time.We also see this being done by other companies like Instacart, which recently rolled out a ChatGPT-powered search tool that can generate suggestions like a selection of high-protein foods or Thanksgiving dinner ideas. Plus, Meta announced a new Bing-backed AI Assistant last month as well as an AI personality chatbot, among other tools.Story continuesImage Credits: WalmartWalmart is also developing an interior design assistant for customers to decorate their rooms. In addition to generative AI, the feature also leverages AR technology; users must upload a photo of a room and it will then take an image capture of every item that's in the space. Customers ask the chat assistant for advice on how they should redecorate, and the AI places items in the room that they suggest. Users can express their opinions on which items they want to keep or buy. The AI also asks for a budget so it can find items that are affordable.The continued investment in generative AI tools is a common theme these days as more companies rush to integrate the technology into their products and services.“Generative AI technology is a priority for the company,” said the Walmart spokesperson.The new tools come on the heels of Walmart rolling out its AI app, “My Assistant,” to 50,000 corporate employees in the U.S. to streamline tasks like summarizing documents, helping prep for meetings and speeding up projects. Walmart has been getting “great feedback” about the app and even found some employees using the assistant to draft “funny out-of-office messages,” the spokesperson added.This article originally appeared on TechCrunch at https://techcrunch.com/2023/10/04/walmart-experiments-with-new-generative-ai-tools-that-can-help-you-plan-a-party-or-decorate-a-space/]"

If you want to see more stocks in this selection, go directly to the 5 Best Bear Market Stocks To Buy Now.The US economy successfully avoided a recession owing to its resilient job market. However, it's worth noting that the job market is usually one of the last facets to weaken when interest rates rise. A recurring pattern has emerged in such economic cycles - out of the last nine instances of Federal Reserve rate hikes, seven resulted in an economic recession. The optimism among investors regarding AI's potential to enhance productivity and drive a new phase of growth played a significant role in the stock market's recovery from the severe drop experienced in 2022, particularly in the first half of this year. Despite the Federal Reserve's decision to raise interest rates as a measure to combat inflation, the S&amp;P 500 made an impressive leap of approximately 20%, briefly touching 4600 by the end of July. For Ed Yardeni, the founder of Yardeni Research, this surge was anticipated, albeit arriving ""ahead of schedule,"" indicating an imminent short-term decline.On October 1, Yardeni reflected on his earlier analysis, stating, ""We concluded that the index might fall to its 200-day moving average, which is currently around 4200."" True to that prediction, since that point, the S&amp;P 500 has indeed experienced a decline of about 7%, reaching around 4,280 by midday on October 2. Yardeni suggests that the index could very well decline further to meet their projected 4,200 mark sometime in October. However, beyond that, he foresees a rebound in the market. In recent months, several economists have revised their growth forecasts for the third-quarter GDP, citing the labor market's resilience and strong consumer spending. The economic forecasters on the panel at the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia revised their outlook in August, now anticipating real GDP growth of 1.9% at an annual rate for the third quarter. This represents a significant increase from their initial June forecast of just 0.6%.Story continuesMost Wall Street investors, however, remain unconvinced by the stock market's gains in 2023, fearing a potential further retreat due to looming recession risks. This sentiment was revealed in the recent CNBC Delivering Alpha investor survey, which gathered opinions from approximately 300 key figures in finance, including chief investment officers, equity strategists, portfolio managers, and CNBC contributors. The survey, aimed to gauge investor outlooks on the markets for the remainder of 2023 and beyond, revealed that over 60% of respondents view this year's stock market gain as merely a temporary bounce within a bear market, foreseeing more challenges on the horizon. On the contrary, 39% of investors believe that a new bull market has already begun.As the year progresses into its latter half, the stock market is already displaying signs of the anticipated recession effects, aligning with J.P. Morgan Research's predictions. It foresees a gradual economic downturn in the United States by late 2023 due to the cautious approach taken by the Federal Reserve, resulting in stricter credit conditions that will slowly exert downward pressure on economic growth. While numerous stocks are experiencing a downward trajectory, specific industries are thriving amidst this economic strain, making their respective stocks appealing investment prospects for global investors. Some notable sectors include Utilities, Healthcare, Consumer Staples, Communication Services, DIY, and related industries. These stocks generally possess a safeguarded profitability, less susceptible to economic cycle fluctuations and changes in consumer confidence.Given the situation, investors are actively seeking out top-performing stocks during a bear market to safeguard their investments. Notably, companies such as Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (NYSE:BRK-B), Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG), and Visa Inc. (NYSE:V) are drawing the interest of investors amid the prevailing bearish trend in the markets.Most Promising Tech Stocks According to AnalystsPhoto by Adam Nowakowski on UnsplashOur MethodologyOur list for the best bear market stocks to buy is grounded in hedge fund sentiment towards each stock.

CVS has been moving its portfolio to a more value-based outcome model, and Aetna was a major move in that direction. We were willing to accept the leverage that came with the deal because CVS has a very cash generative model, and we anticipated the free cash flow would enable the company to de-lever fairly quickly.By mid-2022, CVS was in a position to use the free cash flow that had been going to debt repayment to do bolt-on deals to further prepare for the value-based outcome model and/or return more cash to shareholders in the form of higher dividends or share repurchases. However, CVS lost a “star” in its largest Medicare plan in late 2022 and this will adversely impact earnings in 2024. This was a surprise and disappointment to us, but management should be able to regain the “star” in the back half of 2023, which will then give the company a nice tailwind in 2025…” (Click here to read the full text)12.

JWN need to pay close attention to the stock based on moves in the options market lately. That is because the Oct 20, 2023 $7.50 Call had some of the highest implied volatility of all equity options today.What is Implied Volatility?Implied volatility shows how much movement the market is expecting in the future. Options with high levels of implied volatility suggest that investors in the underlying stocks are expecting a big move in one direction or the other. It could also mean there is an event coming up soon that may cause a big rally or a huge sell-off. However, implied volatility is only one piece of the puzzle when putting together an options trading strategy.What do the Analysts Think?Clearly, options traders are pricing in a big move for Nordstrom shares, but what is the fundamental picture for the company? Currently, Nordstrom is a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) in the Retail - Apparel and Shoes industry that ranks in the Bottom 38% of our Zacks Industry Rank. Over the last 30 days, no analysts have increased their earnings estimates for the current quarter, while one analyst has revised the estimate downward. The net effect has taken our Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current quarter from 15 cents per share to 14 cents in that period.Given the way analysts feel about Nordstrom right now, this huge implied volatility could mean there’s a trade developing. Oftentimes, options traders look for options with high levels of implied volatility to sell premium. This is a strategy many seasoned traders use because it captures decay. At expiration, the hope for these traders is that the underlying stock does not move as much as originally expected.Looking to Trade Options?Check out the simple yet high-powered approach that Zacks Executive VP Kevin Matras has used to close recent double and triple-digit winners.

32,6a4ebb84-9eea-3a97-9857-d80869cc05d0,JWN,2023-10-05,Ticking Time Bombs: 3 Blue-Chip Stocks to Dump Before the Damage Is Done,InvestorPlace,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/ticking-time-bombs-3-blue-003411909.html,1695947651,STORY,"['TROW', 'CPB', 'JWN']","[While it’s an uncomfortable topic, investors need to get serious about certain blue-chip stocks to sell. As some of the biggest and most popular enterprises, the blue chips don’t inherently seem a place to look for red flags. However, as the bankruptcy of Hertz (NASDAQ:HTZ) during the Covid-19 pandemic proved, even the alpha dogs can suffer devastating blows.Further, while being an industry giant affords privileges such as a track record and a framework of stability, none of these factors guarantee sustained success. The harsh reality is that the industry can change or consumer habits can evolve, leaving once-storied blue-chip stocks lurching.Now, I’m not about to present a complete doom-and-gloom narrative for the below enterprises. However, it’s also time to address some harsh realities. Here are the blue-chip stocks to sell (or at least to consider doing so).InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsBlue-Chip Stocks: Nordstrom (JWN)A Nordstrom (JWN) storefront in Toronto, Canada.Source: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.comProbably one of the blue-chip stocks to sell that’s likely not catching anyone by surprise, luxury department store stalwart Nordstrom (NYSE:JWN) faces significant challenges. It’s not just that shares are down more than 10% this year, although that’s a serious concern. After all, the benchmark S&amp;P 500 index gained nearly 12% during the same period. Rather, broader dynamics don’t bode well for JWN.With factors such as stubbornly high inflation, mass layoffs and record-breaking credit-card debt converging, fewer people have discretionary funds available. Even if they did, the smart thing to do amid all these problems is to save as much money as possible. If a recession materializes, it’s unlikely that the majority of the workforce will go unscathed.Not surprisingly, the options market has seen some bearish trades. Notably, on Sept. 11, a trader (or traders) bought 3,006 contracts of the Jan 19 ’24 12.50 Put, which seems an aggressively bearish bet. The premium paid for this transaction was $270,000. Also, analysts peg JWN a moderate sell, with only one analyst seeing it as a buy.Story continuesCampbell Soup (CPB)A variety of Campbell's soups in a grocery store. CPB stock.Source: Sheila Fitzgerald / ShutterstockAt first glance, Campbell Soup (NYSE:CPB) doesn’t seem like a natural candidate for blue-chip stocks to sell. As a food producer – and an iconic one at that – Campbell should theoretically perform well during this cycle of ambiguity. After all, everyone needs to eat, with the company providing a cheap but tasty means of feeding this core demand.Unfortunately, investors simply have other ideas. Since the beginning of the year, CPB gave up more than 26% of equity value. Part of that centers on the harsh consumer economy. In June, CPB slumped due to shoppers pulling back because of price hikes. Put another way, the trade-down effect has reared its ugly head against the canned soup maker.To be fair, a major transactions involving bought calls that expire January next year suggests some optimism. However, a main issue with Campbell now is its balance sheet. With a cash-to-debt ratio sitting at only 0.04x, sustainability woes linger. Also, analysts peg CPB a moderate sell. Conspicuously, among 13 experts, not a single one assigned it a buy rating.T. Rowe Price (TROW)T row price (TROW) logo magnified through a lens while displayed on a web browserSource: Pavel Kapysh / Shutterstock.comAlthough T. Rowe Price (NASDAQ:TROW) offers a contrarian angle, the global investment management firm may be best left as one of the blue-chip stocks to avoid. Since the start of the year, TROW lost a bit more than 5% of equity value. In the trailing five years, it’s also down 5%. The problem is that the surge of meme traders has faded, leaving TROW look rather irrelevant.Of course, the contrarian might pop in and say that the best time to be in the market is during a bearish cycle. While that may be true, you must also consider the other side. During downturns, people lose their jobs. So, the idea of collecting massive profits due to short speculation has a clear constraint. To be fair, implied volatility (IV) for TROW options peaks at 73% for far out-the-money (OTM) calls. However, the IV peaks at 71% for far OTM puts, which means that traders may be hedging for downside risk.Finally, analysts rate TROW a moderate sell. Also, the average price target is only $104.20, implying less than 1% upside.On the date of publication, Josh Enomoto did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.A former senior business analyst for Sony Electronics, Josh Enomoto has helped broker major contracts with Fortune Global 500 companies.

If you want to skip our detailed analysis of the US travel and tourism market, you can go directly to 5 Most Overrated Cities in the US According to Reddit.Travelers have unique tastes and perspectives. While some cities may ignite our passions and surpass our hopes, others can disappoint us and leave us feeling underwhelmed. We will be looking at some of the most overrated cities in the US according to reddit. However, it is important to know that the US has a major travel and tourism market, and some of these overrated cities in our list, as voted by redditors, are actually very popular travel destinations.In one of our articles about the best all-inclusive resorts, we discussed that the global hotel, resorts, and cruise industry is dominated by North America and is expected to experience significant growth in the coming years. The demand for traveling is booming, and the market in the US is growing significantly to reach beyond pre-pandemic levels.Before we take a look at the most overrated cities in the US according to reddit, let’s take a look at the US travel and tourism market and what some of the key players in the market are up to.Market in the US to Lead Global Travel &amp; Tourism ReboundThe World Travel &amp; Tourism Council reported, on August 22, new insights into the strong growth of the US travel and tourism sector, which grew by 16.9% in 2022 while also creating about 2.7 million more jobs as compared to the previous year. Moreover, domestic visitor spending has almost reached its pre-pandemic levels in the US travel and tourism sector, and the comeback and growth is also reflected in statistics of US airports, which continue to be some of the world’s most busiest airports.According to a report by Research And Markets, the US travel and tourism market was valued at around $1.68 trillion in 2022. The market is expected to grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 5% during 2022-2027, propelling the market to reach above $2.15 trillion by the end of the forecasted period. As lockdowns around the world have cooled down, and travel options are back in full swing, the travel and tourism industry is expected to grow significantly in the coming years. The travel and tourism market includes revenues generated by passenger airlines, hotels, restaurants, casinos, resorts, and the gaming market.Story continuesDue to a surge in disposable income, travel and tourism is gaining popularity among the middle class population. Moreover, rising adoption of technology has led to a surge in online bookings as travelers enjoy and prefer the convenience that travel websites, mobile apps, and online booking platforms have to offer. This is expected to further augment market growth during the forecast period.Major US Travel &amp; Tourism Companies: What Are They Up To?With a desire to increase profits and their market share, travel and tourism companies are working towards offering travelers more convenient and affordable options in response to the growing demand for travel.Booking Holdings Inc. (NASDAQ:BKNG) is one of the world’s largest providers of online travel and related services. It's the parent company of several popular travel booking brands, including Booking.com, Priceline, Agoda, Rentalcars.com, and KAYAK. On June 27, Booking Holdings Inc. (NASDAQ:BKNG) announced that its subsidiary Booking.com, one of the world's leading digital travel platforms, will be launching a new AI Trip Planner in beta to a number of US travelers on its app. Powered by large language model (LLM) technology from OpenAI's ChatGPT API, the new trip planner will allow users to easily chat and ask travel-related questions to get help with any stage of their trip planning. Users can check out potential travel destinations and accommodation options, as well as get travel inspiration and create itineraries based on their needs and requirements.Companies that operate and offer hospitality services, including hotels and resorts, are expected to benefit from the increase in travel demand. On July 17, Reuters reported that Marriott International Inc. (NYSE:MAR) and MGM Resorts International (NYSE:MGM) are joining hands and getting creative with their loyalty programs to offer benefits and retain customers as the demand for travel, concerts and sporting events surges across the US. The two travel companies launched ""MGM Collection with Marriott Bonvoy,"" which would make MGM Resorts International’s (NYSE:MGM) 40 million members globally eligible for the Bonvoy loyalty program. On the other hand, members of the Marriott International Inc.’s (NYSE:MAR) Bonvoy rewards program can earn and redeem points to stay at all MGM resorts across the US and Canada.Here are some comments from Marriott International Inc.’s (NYSE:MAR) Q2 2023 earnings call:“As we focus on paths for growth, we are adding new offerings and experiences in segments where we believe there is strong consumer interest beyond our current brands. A great example is our recent announcement of an exclusive 20-year strategic license agreement with MGM Resorts International and the creation of MGM Collection with Marriott Bonvoy. The collection, which will launch beginning in October, encompasses 17 resorts with 40,000 rooms. This deal will provide us with significant presence in Las Vegas, one of the most popular destinations in the country with fantastic properties like Bellagio, the MGM Grand, and ARIA, as well as additional distribution in five other key US cities. Beyond just hotels, our strategic agreement with MGM will also give our members access to more sports, music, culinary and entertainment experiences.”On August 1, Marriott International Inc. (NYSE:MAR) reported strong earnings for the fiscal second quarter of 2023, reflecting strong demand for travel and lodging. The company reported earnings per share of $2.26 and surpassed EPS estimates by $0.09. The company reported a revenue of $6.08 billion and outperformed revenue estimates by $104.2 million.Now that we have taken a look at the US travel and tourism market as well as what some of the key market players are up to, let’s take a look at 20 most overrated cities in the US according to reddit.20 Most Overrated Cities in the US According to RedditMethodologyFor this article, we compiled a list of 20 most overrated cities in the US according to reddit. We went through multiple reddit threads, and used search terms like “most overrated places in the US”, “overrated cities in America”, and “what are the most overrated cities in the United States” to find relevant threads.To ensure the authenticity and relevance of our research, we focused on cities that were most frequently mentioned by redditors across various threads and discussions. People had discussed both the most underrated as well as the most overrated cities. However, for this article, we only considered the opinions about the most overrated cities, and also excluded locations that did not qualify as cities in the US. We used the number of comments and upvotes on several reddit threads, and tabulated the cities based on the number of times their name came up in a comment, as well as the upvotes on these comments. This approach led to a list of 20 most overrated cities in the US according to reddit, which are listed below.20 Most Overrated Cities in the US According to Reddit20. Key West - FloridaFirst up on our list of 20 most overrated cities in the US according to reddit is Key West, an island city in the US state of Florida.

However, according to redditors, Boston can be expensive, and the traffic is not that great either.17. Portland - OregonPortland is the most populated city in the US state of Oregon. As a port city, Portland may not be the right spot for you, especially if you’re a person who hates the rain. Some redditors even pointed out that the city of Portland has an aggressive homeless population and the city itself is not very clean.16. New Orleans - LouisianaNew Orleans, nicknamed the “Big Easy”, is known for its round-the-clock nightlife and vibrant live music scenes.

Nashville is not very walkable and it is no longer the city it used to be, according to redditors, it is now a place where only younger people may enjoy themselves.10.

However, redditors seem to think that Denver is overpriced for no good reason, the traffic is bad, and the city itself can be boring.9. Dallas - TexasDallas, a commercial and cultural hub in Texas, is a modern metropolis. Many redditors find the place boring and don’t see the appeal, and so the city of Dallas ranks among the most overrated cities in the US according to reddit.8. Austin - TexasAustin is the state capital of Texas. The city is quickly becoming a major tech hub. However, many redditors seem to believe that Austin is losing its soul while becoming a major tech center, and quickly becoming one of the most overpriced and overrated cities in the US.7. Chicago - IllinoisChicago is the most populated city in the US state of Illinois and ranks high among the largest cities in the US. While some argue that Chicago is one of the few US cities that are underrated, many redditors seem to believe that the city is too expensive, overrated, and especially overwhelming when it comes to traffic.6. Seattle - Washington StateSeattle is a seaport city, and Washington State’s largest city. Seattle is home to a large tech industry and the city itself is surrounded by water, mountains and evergreen forests. However, many redditors pointed out that because of rising public safety concerns as well as housing costs, the city of Seattle is extremely overrated, and so it ranks high among the most overrated cities in the US according to reddit.Some of the best travel and tourism stocks to consider investing in include Booking Holdings Inc.

If you want to skip our overview of the casino industry and important economic news, then check out The 5 Largest Gambling Stocks of 2023. Gambling is perhaps the best example of a consumer discretionary industry whose fortunes rise and fall with the ability of players to spend significant amounts of money on games of chance that always carry the risk of losses.While the casino and gaming sector was hit by the coronavirus pandemic, inflation and a recovery in discretionary spending have enabled casinos and other establishments to report higher revenues. Casino revenues are generated from the players and are commonly referred to as winnings. These winnings represent the net cash flow to the casino after accounting for amounts that visitors might have won during their game playing.In 2023, the casino and gaming industry in America has been setting new records. According to data from the American Gaming Association (AGA), the second quarter set the record for the second highest winnings reported by casinos operating all over the U.S. The quarterly record was for Q1 2023, and the data shows that consumers have started to recover from the severe inflationary pinch of 2022. The AGA's monthly gaming revenue tracker shows that growth rates dropped to 15 month lows in July 2022 and stood there in August 2022 before slightly recovering for the next couple of months and returning to the low levels in November.In dollar terms, gaming revenue stood at $16 billion in Q2 2023, showing that even though the annual growth rates remained low in July, the dollar revenues showed a recovery. Revenue from slot machines accounts for most of the overall gaming revenue reported by the AGA, and just like other businesses, casino companies are coming up with innovative ways to see if slot players can be enticed to spend more money at the machines.Slot machines typically give tickets at the end of a user's session, which shows the winnings or losses at the end of a session. However, casinos are checking to see if a new approach, called ticket in, bonus out (TIBO), could see players spend more time at a machine if they received free bonus runs at the end of a slot session. Casino systems firm Acres Manufacturing and operator Maverick Gaming are planning to launch TIBO slot machines on casino floors next year. The new approach to generating gaming revenue comes as online and physical betting on sports and iGaming which includes games such as poker are the fastest growing segments of the broader gaming revenue. Both these segments either set or met quarterly records as of June end, while slots grew by a hairline of 0.9% during the same time period.Story continuesGambling spending is tied to the ability of players to earn stable incomes, and on that front, the Labor Department's latest JOLTS job report provided a stark set of results. These show that by the end of August 2023, job openings across the U.S. stood at 9.6 million while only 200,000 more people were hired than the number of those who left their jobs. The dataset fed into existing investor worries about a rate hike from the Federal Reserve in November, since the latest data set was the first time that the number of job openings grew over the past three months. In fact, the labor market added 690,000 new jobs at August end, which was the highest additions figure for two years.If interest rates are left higher, then the environment for both businesses and consumers remains tight. For the gambling industry, higher rates can mean that players have a lower income to spend on making bets as their credit card payments or loan repayments are higher. For casinos, higher interest rates mean that their financing costs for new establishments or equipment can rise. This tightness is reflected in the S&amp;P500, which is down by 1.56% late noon as investors grow cautious about the future economic outlook.For their trailing twelve month performance, most big casino companies have recently started to manage costs and beat market expectations. For instance, one of Las Vegas' most famous casino operators MGM Resorts International (NYSE:MGM) has beaten analyst EPS estimates in two of its four latest quarters, and both of the beats were in the most recent ones. Likewise, Caesars Entertainment, Inc. (NASDAQ:CZR) also beat analyst EPS estimates for Q2 2023 after missing them during the prior two.As a whole, while the gambling industry is dominated mostly by land based players, the gambling industry is made of firms that also provide online betting products, which are also the fastest growing segments. Today, we'll look at the biggest gambling stocks, and the top three are DraftKings Inc. (NASDAQ:DKNG), MGM Resorts International (NYSE:MGM), and Las Vegas Sands Corp.

40,396c0aa3-7b03-3d56-8eb3-1aa8d54c3870,MCHP,2023-10-05,Investing in Microchip Technology (NASDAQ:MCHP) five years ago would have delivered you a 146% gain,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/investing-microchip-technology-nasdaq-mchp-134254300.html,1696426974,STORY,['MCHP'],"[Microchip Technology Incorporated (NASDAQ:MCHP) shareholders might be concerned after seeing the share price drop 13% in the last quarter. But that doesn't change the fact that shareholders have received really good returns over the last five years. Indeed, the share price is up an impressive 128% in that time. Generally speaking the long term returns will give you a better idea of business quality than short periods can. Ultimately business performance will determine whether the stock price continues the positive long term trend.Now it's worth having a look at the company's fundamentals too, because that will help us determine if the long term shareholder return has matched the performance of the underlying business. See our latest analysis for Microchip Technology In his essay The Superinvestors of Graham-and-Doddsville Warren Buffett described how share prices do not always rationally reflect the value of a business. One way to examine how market sentiment has changed over time is to look at the interaction between a company's share price and its earnings per share (EPS).Over half a decade, Microchip Technology managed to grow its earnings per share at 76% a year. This EPS growth is higher than the 18% average annual increase in the share price. So one could conclude that the broader market has become more cautious towards the stock.You can see below how EPS has changed over time (discover the exact values by clicking on the image).earnings-per-share-growthWe know that Microchip Technology has improved its bottom line over the last three years, but what does the future have in store? You can see how its balance sheet has strengthened (or weakened) over time in this free interactive graphic.What About Dividends?As well as measuring the share price return, investors should also consider the total shareholder return (TSR). The TSR incorporates the value of any spin-offs or discounted capital raisings, along with any dividends, based on the assumption that the dividends are reinvested. Arguably, the TSR gives a more comprehensive picture of the return generated by a stock. In the case of Microchip Technology, it has a TSR of 146% for the last 5 years. That exceeds its share price return that we previously mentioned. And there's no prize for guessing that the dividend payments largely explain the divergence!Story continuesA Different PerspectiveIt's good to see that Microchip Technology has rewarded shareholders with a total shareholder return of 17% in the last twelve months. Of course, that includes the dividend. However, the TSR over five years, coming in at 20% per year, is even more impressive. I find it very interesting to look at share price over the long term as a proxy for business performance. But to truly gain insight, we need to consider other information, too. Even so, be aware that  Microchip Technology is showing  1 warning sign in our investment analysis , you should know about...Of course Microchip Technology may not be the best stock to buy.

The S&amp;P 500 (^GSPC) and the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) both were down a modest 0.1%.A pullback in bond yields' blistering rally has brought some relief to battered stocks, and the 10-year Treasury yield (^TNX) was slightly lower after losing hold of 16-year highs the previous session.Data showed US weekly jobless claims ticked higher last week but undershot economists' expectations.

The Coca-Cola Company (KO), Pepsico (PEP): Shares of American multinational corporations Coke and Pepsi both dipped around 5% each amid greater volatility in the consumer staples sector.

""They need to participate in any recovery rally in order to validate the notion that higher interest rates do not doom the US economy to a recession next year. If you are very bullish here, this is the group for you.""Colas and Datatrek aren't bullish on the financials as they believe the Fed needs to be closer to cutting interest rates before it's time to buy bank stocks. Additionally, if something in the economy is required to ""break"" in order for the Fed to start that cutting cycle, it will likely include banks, per Datatrek.""If higher yields cause a recession, then loan losses will rise,"" Colas wrote.

Jlast monthJosh SchaferHigher treasury yields could keep Fed on pause, Fed's Daly saysWhile treasury yields hovering near 16-year highs has weighed on stocks, it could be good news for investors hoping the Federal Reserve is done hiking interest rates.Yahoo Finance's Jennifer Schonberger reports:San Francisco Fed President Mary Daly said Thursday if long-term bond yields remain around current levels, then the Federal Reserve won’t need to raise interest rates again.“The bond market has tightened quite considerably over about 36 basis points since we met in September,” Daly said at the Economic Club of New York. “That is equivalent to about a rate hike. So then the need to do tightening additionally is not there.”Long-term interest rates are at their highest levels since 2007 following a recent run-up. This past month 10-year Treasury yields have risen more than half a percentage point to surpass 4.7%.Daly, a non-voting member of the Fed interest rate setting committee who has been more hawkish this year, noted that if the job market and inflation continue to slow and if financial conditions, which have tightened in the past 90 days, remain tight, then the need for the Fed to take further action is diminished.""Financial markets are already moving in that direction and then they've done the work. We don't need to do it more,"" she said.Fed officials penciled in one more rate hike this year to a range of 5.5%-5.75% before holding rates at that level into next year. Wall Street sees a nearly 80% chance of holding rates at current levels in November.The Fed has raised rates 11 times since March 2022 in the most aggressive rate-hiking campaign since the 1980s. While inflation has dropped, it remains around 4%, around double the Fed’s target.Jlast monthJosh SchaferMortgage rates creep closer to 8%Mortgage rates are still chugging higher as fears about 8% rates are swirling. One economist says that would take a further tick higher in the 10-year Treasury yield.Gabriella Cruz-Martinez reports:Mortgage rates jumped again this week — remaining at a 23-year high and increasing the likelihood that rates could soon hit 8%.The rate on the average 30-year fixed mortgage increased to 7.49% from 7.31% the previous week, according to Freddie Mac, following the yield of the 10-year Treasury, which spiked to a 16-year high this week. Rates are at their highest point since December 2000 for a second week in a row, with few signs of softening.Steeper rates continue to smother homebuyer demand, forcing the price-conscious to the sidelines. Meanwhile, those still on the hunt leaned on lower-rate options, eager to lock in before rates surge higher.“At the beginning of the year, it was widely expected that mortgage rates would fall to around 6% by the end of 2023. However, now the question is whether rates will hit 8% this year,” Lisa Sturtevant, chief economist at Bright MLS, a real estate data provider, said in an emailed statement. “The gap between the yield on the 10-year Treasury and the rate on a 30-year fixed rate mortgage has been around 3 percentage points, so as the Treasury yield approaches 5%, an 8% mortgage rate does not seem unlikely.”Jlast monthJosh SchaferStocks lower in afternoon tradeStocks are lower on Thursday as investor focus shifts to a highly anticipated September jobs report due out on Friday.The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) was down about 0.4% while the S&amp;P 500 (^GSPC) and he tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) dropped roughly 0.5%.After a surge in oil prices and bond yields had weighed on stocks in recent days, both were trading lower on Thursday.Jlast monthJosh SchaferFriday's jobs report could be bad for stocks no matter what it revealsStocks are lower on Thursday as investors eagerly await the September jobs report on Friday morning. But with the Fed's rate hike path in focus, the details of that report could spook investors.Yahoo Finance's Jared Blikre explains:Friday's monthly jobs report from the Bureau of Labor could be a catalyzing event after Wednesday's employment report from ADP materially missed expectations.If the data comes in hot, Peccatiello said, investors would likely chase yields higher until they finally become a chokepoint in the markets. A 5% yield really ""starts to become a real burden for risk assets,"" said Peccatiello.On the other hand, if the headline payroll number comes in weak (much less negative), the weakening labor market could signal a recession is near, which would also send stocks and rates down.Peccatiello acknowledged the irony of the situation, saying: ""Too hot a number [or] too cold a number — it's bad for stocks.""A ""just right"" Goldilocks report merely kicks the can to the next potential catalyst.Jlast monthJosh SchaferJobless claims signal 'very few layoffs' in US economyInitial jobless claims for the week ending September 30 were 207,000, slightly below expectations for 210,000.Claims have largely been in a range of about 200,000 to 250,000 over the past year. Economists believe the limited pickup off the 52-week lows for claims shows that while the labor market be starting to cool, that hasn't mean widespread job loss for American workers.""There are still very few layoffs,"" Oxford economics lead US economist Michael Pearce wrote in a research note Thursday. ""We expect some increase in claims over the coming months as job growth slows further but, for now, labor market conditions are still easing without a significant rise in unemployment.""Jlast monthJosh SchaferStocks roughly flat at open as markets await Jobs reportStocks are in the red at the market open on Thursday as investor focus shifts to a highly anticipated September jobs report due out on Friday.The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) and the S&amp;P 500 (^GSPC) were roughly flat at the open on Thursday, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) dropped about 0.1%.Meanwhile, after reaching 16-year highs on Tuesday, 10-year (^TNX) and 30-year Treasury yields (^TYX) were roughly flat on Thursday.

UBS also thinks the company is likely to pursue acquisitions or increase buybacks.CDW's de-levered balance sheet post the Sirius Computer acquisition and strong free cash flow generation create optionality as the company is likely to pursue incremental accretive transactions targeting faster growth solutions, or allocate an incremental $300-$400M (1%-2%) towards buybacks not reflected in our CY24 and CY25 EPS forecasts.Warner Music earns an upgrade at UBSUBS upgraded Warner Music Group (NASDAQ:WMG) to Buy from Neutral and raised its price target to $37.00 from $34.00.UBS sees the company as a long-term “beneficiary of secular industry trends in music and see the recent pullback as a buying opportunity.”Story continuesThe analysts expect that recent price hikes by digital service providers like Spotify (NYSE:SPOT), YouTube, and Deezer - as well as new avenues for monetization arising from emerging platforms (including the renewed TikTok deal) and an increasing share of the streaming market - will contribute to positive outcomes for the company, potentially exceeding the market's expectations.LyondellBasell Industries receives two upgradesLyondellBasell Industries (NYSE:LYB) picked up two upgrades on Tuesday: Citi upped the company to Buy from Neutral and raised its price target to $106.00 from $104, and KeyBanc raised the company to Sector Weight from Underweight.For Citi, the upgrade was driven by expectations of improving demand, higher exports, and supply disruptions in North America.The analysts added:""Additionally, the run-up in crude has created an asymmetric risk/reward at current share prices and recent export strength in PE has led to two consecutive 3c/lb M/M price increases.

Basically, everyone must pay their bills associated with core services. Otherwise, no pay, no play.Fundamentally, utilities stocks benefit from a natural monopoly. Legally speaking, an enterprise could potentially compete with a utility powerhouse. However, the barriers to entry – from the costs involved and the regulatory hoops – prevent would-be rivals from even trying. Therefore, these established giants can almost do whatever they want.Second, there’s no trade-down effect involved with utilities stocks because it’s a binary proposition. Unless you go off the grid completely, you either have the critical service or you don’t. Therefore, folks pay up because they have no choice, which bodes well for the below entities.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsDuke Energy (DUK)The logo for Duke Energy (DUK) is seen on a sign at one of the company's offices.Source: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.comA seemingly top-tier idea among utilities stocks to buy, Duke Energy (NYSE:DUK) theoretically should be performing a lot better than it has. An electric power and natural gas holding firm, Duke provides coverage to compelling regions, such as the Carolinas. With millennials increasingly moving to these places on or near the eastern coastline, Duke operates where the money is going.However, since the January opener, shares have slipped more than 13%. In the trailing one-year period, DUK lost almost 10%, which doesn’t seem congruent with its relevance. However, a look at Fintel’s options flow screener – which targets big block trades likely made by institutions – presents an encouraging canvas.While options trades in September have been decidedly bearish, the most recent transaction provides hope. Basically, a major trader (or traders) sold 10,000 contracts of the Nov 17 ’23 85.00 Put, collecting a $1.06 million premium in the process. In my opinion, that seems aggressively bullish. Also, analysts peg DUK as a moderate buy with a $99.75 target, implying nearly 11% upside potential.Story continuesExelon (EXC)The logo for Exelon (EXC) is visible at the top of an office building.Source: photosounds / Shutterstock.comHeadquartered in Chicago, Illinois, Exelon (NASDAQ:EXC) is the largest electric parent company in the U.S. by revenue, per its public profile. Given its massive footprint, one might expect EXC to perform well. However, the opposite is true. Since the beginning of this year, EXC has fallen a bit over 10%. In the past 365 days, shares have gone nowhere, dipping 2%.Adding to the worries, major options traders in this case seem bearish on Exelon. For example, on Sept. 26, a trader bought 672 contracts of the Nov 17 ’23 36.00 Put, paying a premium of nearly $27,000. On Aug. 22, a trader (or several traders) sold 2,708 contracts of the Oct 20 ’23 42.00 Put, collecting a premium of $144,716.However, the risk for the shorts is that all it takes is a rotation away from speculation and toward more reliable entities. You can’t get much more reliable than massive utilities stocks to buy. If you want to go contrarian, analysts rate EXC a strong buy with a $44.44 price target, implying 15% upside.PG&amp;E (PCG)Numerous electric lines are seen at sunset.Source: Pand P Studio / Shutterstock.comOne of the top utilities stocks, PG&amp;E (NYSE:PCG) provides electricity and natural gas service to much of Northern and Central California. Right there, PG&amp;E deserves a look for its massive relevance. Love it or hate it, the Golden State represents the economic engine of the U.S. Without California, our nation wouldn’t quite be the massive superpower that it is.Sure enough, investors seem to recognize this overwhelming catalyst. Since the start of the year, PCG gained just under 5%. That’s nothing to write home about but relatively speaking, that’s a decent run. Still, investors should be aware of some storms brewing in the derivatives market. Specifically, a major trader sold 2,601 contracts of the Nov 17 ’23 17.00 Call, collecting a $158,539 premium.While that’s distracting, keep in mind that PCG stock closed recently at $16.44. All it needs is an understanding that investors may prefer risk-off assets as opposed to risk-on. Thus, it’s possible that PCG can swing higher, blowing up this apparently bearish trade. Oh yeah, analysts rate shares a strong buy with a $19.33 price target.Sempra Energy (SRE)The logo for Sempra (SRE) is seen at the top of an office building.Source: Michael Vi / Shutterstock.comWhile Sempra Energy (NYSE:SRE) as a business doesn’t get much love from its users, it does plenty to earn the respect of shareholders. Actually, I’m not sure if that’s true in the active sense. Rather, Sempra benefits passively by covering segments of the extremely lucrative Southern California market. As stated earlier with PG&amp;E, California represents an economic powerhouse just by itself. So, SRE is one of the utilities stocks to buy.In fairness, though, it doesn’t seem that way. Since the January opener, SRE slipped almost 10%. In the past 365 days, the security gave up nearly 12% of its equity value. And sure enough, institutional traders seem pessimistic about SRE. For example, an entity sold 1,901 contracts of the Nov 17 ’23 75.00 Call on Sept. 21, collecting a nearly $230,000 premium.With SRE down at $69.41 recently, that might seem like a good trade. But Sempra’s consistent profitability could move the needle to the upside, blowing up this bear trade. Lastly, analysts peg shares as a moderate buy with an $82.15 price target, implying over 18% upside.NiSource (NI)Image of a gas burner with a blue flameSource: ShutterstockA concocting mix between speculation and opportunity, NiSource (NYSE:NI) is one of the largest fully regulated utilities stocks in the U.S. Per its public profile, NiSource services approximately 3.5 million natural gas customers and half a million electric customers across six states. That seems powerfully relevant. Unfortunately, NI shares have fallen more than 8% since the January opener.In the past 365 days, NI dipped 7.5%. And in the trailing five years, shares only gained 1%, reflecting how many investors turned to risk-on assets. Adding to the concerns for NI, major traders have been bearish. For instance, on Sept. 27, an entity (or entities) bought 6,099 contracts of the Oct 20 ’23 25.00 Put, paying a premium of $202,500.With shares trading hands at $25.18 recently, it seems this put will go in the money (ITM). However, implied volatility (IV) runs higher on the far out-the-money (OTM) calls than the OTM puts. In other words, I see a clear risk to the bears that investors will rotate toward more reliable ideas. Finally, analysts rate NI a unanimous strong buy with a $30.80 price target.American Electric Power (AEP)the American Electric Power logo is magnified on a websiteSource: Casimiro PT / Shutterstock.comA major investor-owned electric utility in the U.S., American Electric Power (NASDAQ:AEP) delivers electricity to more than five million customers in 11 states, according to its corporate profile. Also, AEP ranks among the nation’s largest generators of electricity, owning nearly 38,000 megawatts of generating capacity. Sadly, investors don’t seem to care right now.Since the January opener, AEP fell 20%. In the trailing one-year period, AEP gave up about 19% of its equity value. Since the spring doldrums of 2020, AEP has gyrated wildly across the map. In addition, the volatile swings have attracted bearish attention. Looking at Fintel’s options flow screener, the latest major transaction (Sept. 21) involved the selling of 1,000 contracts of the Oct 20 ’23 82.50 Call.Overall, the net profile seems bearish on AEP. However, it appears that the institutional options trades will expire on Oct. 20. It’s possible that without this overhang beginning the following Monday, AEP might move higher. It’s speculation, of course. Still, AEP carries a strong buy rating with a $93.38 target, implying over 23% upside potential.NextEra Energy (NEE)Environmental protection, renewable, sustainable energy sources. Plant growing in the bulb concept. renewable energy stocks to buySource: Proxima Studio / Shutterstock.comOn paper, NextEra Energy (NYSE:NEE) seems a shoo-in for utilities stocks to buy. One of the most popular companies given its focus on renewable energy, NextEra commands about 58 gigawatts (GW) of generating capacity. Per its public profile, the company is the largest electric utility holding company by market capitalization. Sadly, it’s not really looking too special in the charts.Since the start of the year, NEE fell more than 28%. Conspicuously, the security gave up nearly 12% of its equity value just in the past one-month period. And even with the decline in market value, NEE trades at a forward earnings multiple of 17.65x. That’s above the sector median of 13.94x, thus ranking worse than 82.48% of the competition.Interestingly, a major trader appears to have bought 4,110 contracts of the Jan 19 ’24 80.00 Put, paying a premium of $3.65 million. This premium represents 10.86 standard deviations above the mean, which is worrying. Still, if NEE bounces back, it could hurt the bears. Interestingly, analysts rate NEE a strong buy with an average price target of $85.46.On the date of publication, Josh Enomoto did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.A former senior business analyst for Sony Electronics, Josh Enomoto has helped broker major contracts with Fortune Global 500 companies.

56,d859437e-6212-3c7d-bfeb-f0a47e426934,NWS,2023-10-05,Realtor.com® September Housing Report: Home Prices Rise As Inventory Crunch Continues,PR Newswire,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/realtor-com-september-housing-report-100000228.html,1696500000.0,STORY,"['NWS', 'NWSA', 'NWSAL']","[In September, active inventory shrank on an annual basis for the third month in a row, despite boost from August's unseasonal bump in new listings While home prices rose annually, a surprising uptick in price-reduced homes from August to September reflects last year's trend and offers some relief amid ongoing affordability concernsSANTA CLARA, Calif., Oct. 5, 2023 /PRNewswire/ -- For the second month in a row, home prices rose on an annual basis in September (+0.4%) as the inventory shortfall lingers, with the number of homes on the market falling year over year for the third consecutive month (-4.0%), according to the Realtor.com® September Monthly Housing Trends Report released today. Active inventory remained 45.1% below pre–pandemic (2017-2019) levels, although the number of homes for sale increased month-over-month (4.9%) in September, contrary to typical seasonal trends but attributable to the unusual bump in new listings in August.This month, new listings realigned with typical declines between August and September. However, despite persistent inventory challenges bolstering prices, an unseasonable month-over-month uptick in price reductions hints at potential market adjustments. While a greater share of homes saw price reductions during the past month than expected for this time of year, the percentage of homes with price reductions decreased year over year, from 20.2% in September of last year to 17.8% this year, and remains below typical levels seen from 2017 to 2019. This suggests that buyer and seller expectations aren't significantly misaligned, at least for now.""An uptick in homes with reduced prices is a small break for buyers on top of the usual seasonal factors that align to make this first week in October the best week to buy. Yet, the larger context remains challenging. Buyers still struggle with the triple threat of rising listing prices, record-high mortgage rates, and limited inventory, making affordability a continued concern,"" said Danielle Hale, Chief Economist for Realtor.com®. ""The number of homes for sale is likely to remain low as higher mortgage rates leave many homeowners feeling 'locked in' to their current rates. Data shows low inventory is pushing many homebuyers toward new homes, but the growth in new construction isn't enough to sufficiently narrow the inventory gap.""Story continuesWhat it means for homebuyers, sellers, and the housing marketWhile the unexpected rise in new home listings from July to August led to higher September inventory than typically seen this time of year, homes are selling quickly, keeping overall inventory limited. This scarcity has been a driving factor in maintaining high listing prices.Despite a greater share of homes with price reductions, affordability headwinds continue: higher mortgage rates have increased the monthly cost of financing 80% of the typical home by roughly $256 (+12.4%) compared to a year ago, far outpacing wage growth (+4.3%) and inflation (+3.7%).""Homes on the market are still moving quickly, indicating that many buyers are accepting today's high prices and mortgage rates and adjusting their expectations,"" said Realtor.com®'s Executive News Editor Clare Trapasso. ""That may mean a number of things: settling for less space or moving farther away from large cities or to a different region.""To help determine their best next step, potential homebuyers can tap into Realtor.com® RealCost tools, including the Affordability Calculator or the Rent vs. Buy Calculator.September 2023 Housing Metrics – NationalMetricChange over Sep 2022Change over Sep 2019Median listing price+0.4% (to $430,000)+37.5 %Active listings-4.0 %-42.7 %New listings-9.1 %-21.0 %Median days on market+1 days (to 48 days)-14 daysShare of active listings with price reductions-2.5 percentage points (to 17.8%)+0.3 percentage pointsListing prices stay steady, but price cuts climb uncharacteristicallyIn September, the national median home listing price declined seasonally from August, but increased slightly over September 2022, marking the second month in a row that listing prices have increased on an annual basis. Limited inventory has kept listing prices high, and while new home sales are elevated, new construction hasn't been able to fully address inventory constraints. Meanwhile, although the share of price-reduced homes is down compared with last September, month-over-month growth is beginning to mirror last year's trend, with price cuts accelerating in the fall as high listing prices and interest rates deter many buyers.While the U.S. median list price saw a seasonal monthly decline, to $430,000 from $435,000 in August, it is up +0.4% compared to last year.All regions saw active listing prices in larger metros increase on average, but Northeastern metros saw the highest annual growth rate (+10.0%).Prices in Los Angeles (+23.8%), San Diego (+18.2%), and Richmond, Va.. (+15.0%) saw the biggest increases among large metros, predominantly due to larger and more expensive homes coming on the market in these areas. Larger Southern metros saw the lowest listing price growth rate among the regions (3.1%).Among the largest 50 metros, only eight saw their median list price decline, led by San Antonio (-2.8%), Memphis, Tenn. (-2.1%), and Houston (-1.5%).Nationally, the share of homes with price reductions decreased from 20.2% in September of last year to 17.8% this year and remains below 2017-2019 levels on average.Fourteen of the 50 large metros saw the share of price reductions increase compared to last September, predominantly in the South and Midwest. Memphis, Tenn., saw the greatest increase (+6.0 percentage points), followed by Indianapolis (+4.4), and San Antonio (+3.4).Inventory rises from August levels, yet remains scarceWhile newly listed homes showed an unusual increase from July to August this year, higher mortgage rates and more typical seasonality realigned inventory with the expected seasonal decline from August to September. Year over year, the number of homes actively for sale decreased on an annual basis in September for the third consecutive month, following a period of growth starting in April 2022. This can be attributed in part to highly unseasonal inventory growth in 2022 as the market slowed down late last summer and into fall. However, the gap between this September and the same time last year is narrowing, as inventory increased month over month on the heels of an unexpected bump in new listings in August. Even so, active inventory remained below typical 2017-2019 levels.Nationally, active inventory in September dropped -4.0% year-over-year. Despite an increase in homes for sale from August to September (+4.9%), active inventory remains -45.1% below 2017-2019 levels.Pending listings fell -12.2% from the same time last year, more than August's -11.5% decline due in part to higher mortgage rates in July and August, but significantly better than December's peak decline (-36.9% year over year). Pending listings are an early indicator of future sales, which slowed to an annual pace of 4.04 million in August.Newly listed homes fell -9.1% compared to September last year, more than August's -7.5% year-over-year drop.Regionally, inventory grew slightly in the South, by 1.5% compared to September 2022, but declined year-over-year in the West (-27.7%), Northeast (-12.9%), and Midwest (-6.9%).In the 50 largest U.S. metro areas, the number of homes for sale is -41.9% below pre-pandemic levels. Inventory decreased in 36 out of 50 of the largest metros compared to last year, although some Southern metros saw significant growth, such as Memphis, Tenn. (+35.6%), New Orleans (28.4%) and San Antonio (24.4%).Among the top 50 metros, San Antonio (+4.4%), and Buffalo, N.Y. (+2.1%) saw new listings increase. Declines in newly listed homes were greatest in Las Vegas (-31.7%), New York, N.Y. (-23.6%) and Detroit, Mich. (-21.9%).Homes selling two weeks faster than pre-pandemic periodWhile the time the typical home spent on the market remained fairly flat year over year this September, the typical home spent two weeks less on the market this past month than during the average September from 2017 to 2019. Time on market is rising more slowly this year, as homebuyers compete for limited supply.In September, the typical home spent 48 days on the market, only one day longer than the same time in 2022, but two weeks less than in the average September between 2017 and 2019.Regionally, only large metros in the South saw time on market increase on average year-over-year (+1 day). Large metros in the Northeast spent 2 days less on the market, those in the Midwest spent 3 days less on the market, and homes spent 4 days less than last year in the West.Time on market increased in 17 of the 50 largest metros, including New Orleans (+11 days), Austin, Texas (+8 days), and Nashville, Tenn. (+6 days).Time on market decreased compared to last year in 30 of the 50 largest metro areas. The largest drops were in San Jose, Calif., San Francisco (-9 days), and Sacramento, Calif. (-8 days). This is primarily because this region experienced the most significant slowdown last year when interest rates rose.September 2023 Housing Overview by Top 50 Largest Metros Metro AreaMedian Listing PriceMedian Listing Price YoYMedian Listing Price per Sq.

The company reported that sales fell by about 30 percent.Lithium Americas (LAC) shares jumped after the company split into two separate publicly traded companies, splitting from its Argentina unit (LAAC).Energy stocks such as Exxon Mobil (XOM), Marathon Oil (MRO), and Phillips 66 (PSX), close the day in the red as oil prices pulled back from their 2023 highs.Yahoo Finance Live breaks down some of the trending stocks of the day. For more expert insight and the latest market action, click here to watch this full episode of Yahoo Finance Live.Video TranscriptJULIE HYMAN: Big egg maker, Cal-Maine Foods, those shares sliding as the egg producer provided a weak earnings report. The company's sales in the quarter slumped by about 30%. The shares down 7% on the day here. Average selling prices for shell eggs have returned to more normalized levels, said the CEO Sherman Miller. And the overall egg supply is recovering from avian influenza.You know, we've been watching egg prices so closely. They were really a big headline there and part of CPI for a while. That was good news for Cal-Maine for a little bit, right? I mean, not easy to deal with an avian influenza outbreak but from a price perspective was positive. And so normalization in their case is not necessarily good for their sales.JOSH LIPTON: Yeah. Reported earnings and missed sales down about 30%. And to your point, the average egg prices apparently down to 159 per dozen from 228 in the year ago period. Good news for me and my breakfast every morning, not so much for them.JULIE HYMAN: Are you an egg guy every day?JOSH LIPTON: Great egg guy, huge egg guy. Oh, yeah. You just combine it with, you know, your 40 milligrams of Lipitor, and you're fine. That's the idea.JULIE HYMAN: I don't-- I think that's an old way--JOSH LIPTON: Isn't that what doctors advise?JULIE HYMAN: No, that's an old way of thinking.Story continuesJOSH LIPTON: Oh, is it?JULIE HYMAN: I don't think there's such a concern about eggs and cholesterol anymore.JOSH LIPTON: Don't be slandering the eggs. I should be saying.JULIE HYMAN: I think eggs--JOSH LIPTON: I'll stand downJULIE HYMAN: --eggs are OK now. I don't know. All right.JOSH LIPTON: Moving on Lithium Americas splits into two separate publicly traded companies. Shares surging as Lithium Americas separates from its Argentine segment. So this one, Lithium Mining startup now transforming into two companies, Julie. And I guess spinning off Lithium Americas Argentina to shareholders. So if you want to invest in lithium, critical for EVs, here's your chance.JULIE HYMAN: So Lithium Americas owns the Thacker Pass Project, which is in Nevada. And this is something they've been working on for a while, because just like we are trying to get all kinds of supply chain things based or reshored here in the US, lithium is among them. Obviously, there's a huge demand for lithium because of batteries, particularly for electric cars. So this has been something that has been sort of a speculative play, because it's not yet producing lithium at that mine as of yet, because it's still under construction. But it's been an interesting story.But you can see the shares falling of Lithium America as that split goes into effect. We've been watching a lot of splits over the past week or so.JOSH LIPTON: It's been a theme.JULIE HYMAN: And many of them have not been doing well.JOSH LIPTON: No, no.JULIE HYMAN: So it's been an interesting space to watch now, but we're going to continue to watch lithium one. We also are going to continue to watch energy stocks. Now, I was just talking about what was going on with them in terms of the overall sectors feeling the pressure in today's trading session. Oil prices pulling back from their 2023 highs last month. Exxon just one example, down by 4% here. But it has really been an interesting day for many of these.And if you take a look inside the YFi interactive again, just to look at the sectors and get some perspective on what's been happening. So the XLE, that's today here for the XLE. But if you take it out to three months. And you will see a very different picture, where you have seen it as the best performing sector in the S&amp;P 500. And that's because of what we have been seeing with oil prices, right?Here's another look at that three months on an individual basis. So there's the heat map of all the big energy names on that three-month basis. If you look year-to-date, it is not as clear what's been going on. But really, the surge has been coming in the past few months for many of these companies.Here's ExxonMobil, for example, that's the daily chart. If you look at year-to-date, you can see zig-zag but really coming up from the high-- from the lows in July and recovering since that time.JOSH LIPTON: Yeah. The decline in oil price is just sending energy stocks lower across the board here. You point out Chevron, Exxon, Occidental Petroleum, take your name. We mentioned JPMorgan at the beginning of the show and their take on this. Their year-end target, 86 per barrel. So if you're an investor, you're trying to find the stocks that can work in that universe, you've got to maybe pick your spots. We had Neil Dingmann from Truist, though, giving us some names.JULIE HYMAN: He did. And Conoco was among them. He said you want the lower cost oil producers that are able to get more margins out of that oil they're taken out of the ground.]"

With healthy fundamentals, this Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) stock appears to be a solid investment option at the moment. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Growth DriversNotwithstanding challenging macroeconomic conditions associated with the challenging macroeconomic environment, Altice is on track with its five-year plan to build a FTTH (fiber-to-the-home) network and deploy its new home communications hub.The company believes that the FTTH network will be more resilient with reduced maintenance requirements, fewer service outages and lower power usage, which is likely to lead to further cost efficiencies. This network will allow Altice to satisfy demand for increasing speeds and support evolving technologies, such as the expected transition of mobile networks to 5G and enable it to capitalize on associated revenue-growth opportunities.Additionally, the company is building a next-generation fiber network capable of delivering broadband speeds of 10 Gbps, reflecting continued investments in technology and innovation for its customers in the United States. Total fiber broadband customers reached 250,000 by the end of second-quarter 2023, and are expected to grow at an accelerated pace.The company is focused on accelerating its network expansion plans along with market penetration and fiber network upgrades for long-term sustainable growth. It offers a range of broadband speeds for all budgets, from Altice Advantage Internet to multi-gigabit services for enterprise customers.Altice is placing a strong emphasis on customer satisfaction and has made significant investments to enhance its customer service. Customer calls for care and technical support have been reduced due to improvement in troubleshooting tools and self-service capabilities. These efforts are helping Altice maintain a high level of customer satisfaction, which is likely to reap long-term benefits.Story continuesThe company has a market presence in some of the most populous and economically active regions of the United States, such as the New York City metro area. This gives the company a significant growth opportunity, as these regions have high demand for high-speed Internet and other telecommunications services.The buyout of Morris Broadband, a fast-growing broadband communications services company that provides high-speed data, video and voice services to almost 36,500 customers in western North Carolina, expands Altice’s footprint in the state where it already has presence with its Suddenlink business. This deal makes North Carolina the sixth largest state for Altice in terms of the number of customers.Also, it shows the company’s commitment to investing significantly in technology and infrastructure in the region. The buyout allows Altice to benefit from greater scale, operating efficiency and additional investments, which are at the core of its business strategy.With a VGM Score of B, this stock appears to be an enticing investment option in the volatile market.Other Key PicksArista Networks, Inc.

The decision is aimed to provide PSG full autonomy and flexibility to script its own growth trajectory within the FPGA industry that serves as a harbinger of technological innovations across diverse sectors.With PSG scheduled to commence its standalone operations from the onset of 2024, Intel will report its results as a separate business unit beginning first-quarter 2024. Over the next two to three years, it intends to conduct an IPO for PSG while exploring opportunities with private investors for a probable stake, with Intel retaining the majority ownership.Despite charting newer frontiers, the two companies are likely to remain strategically aligned and will work in unison to address key areas of the FPGA industry, which is expected to witness a CAGR of more than 9% from $8 billion in revenues in 2023 to $11.5 billion by 2027. In addition to unlocking more value through financial autonomy, the standalone business is widely expected to help the parent company regain its leading position in the semiconductor ecosystem through its unique relationship with Intel Foundry Services (“IFS”).IFS has emerged as a linchpin in Intel's integrated device manufacturing 2.0 strategy, aimed at regaining technological leadership and enhancing manufacturing scale. Leveraging its internal relationship with IFS, PSG will be able to offer customers greater predictability of supply aligned to their needs, ensuring a more resilient supply chain to address fast-growing markets like automotive, data center and communications.Sandra Rivera, executive vice president at Intel, has been given the role of chief executive officer of PSG. Widely acclaimed as being the key person in putting Intel’s DCAI business back on its growth track with a more competitive product roadmap, emphasis on delivering customer value and diligent execution of operational plans, Rivera is arguably the best candidate for spearheading these radical changes.Intel has been lately facing dwindling overall sales largely due to PC inventory correction and contraction in the server market. Revenues declined significantly in first-quarter 2023 owing to a challenging macroeconomic environment, uncertain business conditions and softening demand trends.Consequently, top management has embarked on a massive investment roadmap by developing new manufacturing hubs and improving its operating technology to retrieve its growth momentum. The spin-off of the chip business is probably another decisive step in that direction.The stock has gained 29.1% over the past year compared with the industry’s growth of 123%.Story continuesZacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchIntel currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

The CMA needs to show restraint,” it said.Ofcom concernsIn a 254-page report into cloud computing, Ofcom said it was “particularly concerned” about Amazon and Microsoft’s position.It said the companies used a series of tactics to maintain their position, including charging customers to switch to different providers, putting up barriers to making software work on different cloud systems, and offering big discounts up front for customers that exclusively work with one company.Ofcom said: “We are concerned that the threat of customers switching away from the market leaders will reduce, further dampening competition for new and existing customers.”Increasing cloud relianceThe CMA’s chief executive Sarah Cardell said: “This is a £7.5bn market that underpins a whole host of online services – from social media to AI foundation models. Many businesses now completely rely on cloud services, making effective competition in this market essential.”Story continuesThe CMA has already fought a long battle with Microsoft over its takeover of video game company Activision Blizzard and has investigated how Amazon treats sellers on its online marketplace.Amazon and Microsoft have both warned that interventions could hit investment in the UK.A Microsoft spokesman said: “We are committed to ensuring the UK cloud industry remains innovative, highly competitive and an accelerator for growth across the economy. We will engage constructively with the CMA as they conduct their Cloud Services Market Investigation.”Amazon said: “We disagree with Ofcom’s findings and believe they are based on a fundamental misconception of how the IT sector functions, and the services and discounts on offer. Only a small percentage of IT spend is in the cloud, and customers can meet their IT needs from any combination of on-premises hardware and software, managed or co-location services, and cloud services.

Cortes is represented by the conservative National Right to Work Foundation.Cortes claims that restrictions in U.S. labor law on the president's ability to remove the NLRB's five members from office violate the U.S. Constitution.NLRB spokeswoman Kayla Blado declined to comment on the lawsuit. Starbucks is not involved in the case.Federal law only allows NLRB members, who are appointed by the president and confirmed by the Senate, to be removed for ""neglect of duty or malfeasance in office.""The NLRB typically has three members from the president's party and two from the opposing party. The members' five-year terms are staggered, so it can take years for control to change hands under a new presidential administration. The NLRB currently has a 3-1 Democratic majority, with one vacancy.Cortes says the president should be able to remove NLRB members at will because they wield executive power by enforcing federal labor law, including overseeing union elections, issuing subpoenas and making rules.The lawsuit seeks to strike down the limits on the president's removal powers. Cortes said she also will move to block the NLRB from ruling on her petition pending the outcome of the lawsuit.The National Right to Work Foundation represents workers in legal disputes with unions and has criticized recent rulings by the Democrat-led labor board making it easier to unionize.The Buffalo store is one of more than 360 Starbucks locations in the U.S. to unionize since 2021.Story continuesThe labor board is currently considering more than 100 cases accusing Starbucks of unlawful conduct, including firing union supporters, barring organizing in stores and refusing to bargain with unions. Starbucks has denied wrongdoing.Cortes in her lawsuit says the union is unpopular at the Buffalo store and that a majority of employees there are in favor of dissolving it.An NLRB official dismissed Cortes' petition in May, saying no election could be held until cases accusing Starbucks of unfair labor practices at the Buffalo store were resolved. Cortes has appealed that decision to the five-member board.(Reporting by Daniel Wiessner in Albany, New York, Editing by Alexia Garamfalvi and Deepa Babington)]"

Starbucks says the closure is ""standard course of business.""

Yahoo Finance's Brooke DiPalma explains the coffee chain's decision.For more expert insight and the latest market action, click here to watch this full episode of Yahoo Finance Live.Video TranscriptJULIE HYMAN: Starbucks is closing seven stores in San Francisco by the end of the month. It's the latest big chain to pull out of the Downtown area, following Target and Whole Foods, who cited rising homelessness and safety issues. Yahoo Finance's Brooke DiPalma is here with more.Brooke, you know, I keep trying to figure out, as we keep getting these headlines, how much of this is routine and how much of it is unusual? What can you tell us about Starbucks, in particular?BROOKE DIPALMA: Right. Good afternoon, Julie. Well, certainly, here Starbucks playing this as a simple real estate strategy. They're saying that it's a standard course of business, and they continue to evaluate the store portfolio. So those seven stores in San Francisco will close on October 22.And they said that employees were informed on Monday, and they'll be given the opportunity to transfer to another location on that date nearby. Now, as you can see here, these store locations are mainly in the Downtown San Francisco area that's gotten a lot of buzz recently, especially post-COVID.They include a Mission and Main, Battery street, and Market Street, among others. And it is worth noting that none of these locations are Union stores. So these are not stores that voted to unionize. But in a letter from Northern California Regional Vice President to employees, she said that there are several factors Starbucks considers when tasked with the tough decision of closing a store, but it's all part of ensuring a healthy store portfolio.Story continuesNow, despite these closures, Starbucks will still have a presence in San Francisco. They now have 59 stores in San Francisco. And following these closures on October 22, there will be 52 remaining. But when Starbucks asked if this was a decision made due to a threat of safety of both employees and customers, well, Starbucks spokesperson declined to comment on that front.But as you noted, Julie, this is a big story here, considering the fact that just last week, Target closed three stores in the San Francisco and Oakland area due to a threat of retail crime and organized retail crime, that is. Also, in addition to that, we saw earlier this year, Whole Foods market closed on Market Street in San Francisco due to safety concerns.And you see here a slew of others have recently closed, including Amazon Go stores, Anthropology, Office Depot, Old Navy, as well as Saks Off 5th. And this also comes as San Francisco downtown area, you know, they continue to struggle to bring back foot traffic post-COVID as not many people, office employees, are going back there, as we continue to see vacancy rates rise in offices downtown. So certainly, lots of factors, but Starbucks saying here is simply a real estate play.- Brooke DiPalma, Thank you.]"

High Yield Dividend Stocks in Gurus' PortfolioThis Powerful Chart Made Peter Lynch 29% A Year For 13 YearsHow to calculate the intrinsic value of a stock?Sysco is the largest U.S. food-service distributor, boasting 17% market share of the highly fragmented food-service distribution industry. Sysco distributes over 400,000 food and nonfood products to restaurants (63% of revenue), healthcare facilities (8%), education and government buildings (8%), travel and leisure (7%), and other locations (14%) where individuals consume away-from-home meals. In fiscal 2023, 70% of the firm's revenue was derived from its U.S. foodservice operations, while its international (18%), quick-service (10%), and other (2%) segments made up the difference.Unwrapping Sysco Corp's Dividend Performance: A Comprehensive AnalysisSysco Corp's Dividend Track RecordSysco Corp has maintained a consistent dividend payment record since 1971.

Sysco Corp's revenue has increased by approximately 13.30% per year on average, a rate that outperforms than approximately 76.04% of global competitors.The company's 3-year EPS growth rate showcases its capability to grow its earnings, a critical component for sustaining dividends in the long run.

However, investors should continue to monitor these metrics to ensure they remain favorable.GuruFocus Premium users can screen for high-dividend yield stocks using the High Dividend Yield Screener.This article first appeared on GuruFocus.]"
79,1a71c09c-629c-315d-8128-7684ca669e02,SYY,2023-10-05,When Should You Buy Sysco Corporation (NYSE:SYY)?,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/buy-sysco-corporation-nyse-syy-140030498.html,1696428030,STORY,['SYY'],"[Today we're going to take a look at the well-established Sysco Corporation (NYSE:SYY). The company's stock saw significant share price movement during recent months on the NYSE, rising to highs of US$76.31 and falling to the lows of US$65.18. Some share price movements can give investors a better opportunity to enter into the stock, and potentially buy at a lower price. A question to answer is whether Sysco's current trading price of US$64.28 reflective of the actual value of the large-cap? Or is it currently undervalued, providing us with the opportunity to buy? Let’s take a look at Sysco’s outlook and value based on the most recent financial data to see if there are any catalysts for a price change. View our latest analysis for Sysco Is Sysco Still Cheap?The share price seems sensible at the moment according to my price multiple model, where I compare the company's price-to-earnings ratio to the industry average. In this instance, I’ve used the price-to-earnings (PE) ratio given that there is not enough information to reliably forecast the stock’s cash flows. I find that Sysco’s ratio of 18.34x is trading slightly below its industry peers’ ratio of 19.41x, which means if you buy Sysco today, you’d be paying a decent price for it. And if you believe that Sysco should be trading at this level in the long run, then there’s not much of an upside to gain over and above other industry peers. Is there another opportunity to buy low in the future? Since Sysco’s share price is quite volatile, we could potentially see it sink lower (or rise higher) in the future, giving us another chance to buy. This is based on its high beta, which is a good indicator for how much the stock moves relative to the rest of the market.What kind of growth will Sysco generate?earnings-and-revenue-growthFuture outlook is an important aspect when you’re looking at buying a stock, especially if you are an investor looking for growth in your portfolio. Buying a great company with a robust outlook at a cheap price is always a good investment, so let’s also take a look at the company's future expectations. Sysco's earnings over the next few years are expected to increase by 41%, indicating a highly optimistic future ahead. This should lead to more robust cash flows, feeding into a higher share value.Story continuesWhat This Means For YouAre you a shareholder? It seems like the market has already priced in SYY’s positive outlook, with shares trading around industry price multiples. However, there are also other important factors which we haven’t considered today, such as the track record of its management team. Have these factors changed since the last time you looked at SYY? Will you have enough conviction to buy should the price fluctuate below the industry PE ratio?Are you a potential investor? If you’ve been keeping tabs on SYY, now may not be the most advantageous time to buy, given it is trading around industry price multiples. However, the optimistic forecast is encouraging for SYY, which means it’s worth diving deeper into other factors such as the strength of its balance sheet, in order to take advantage of the next price drop.If you want to dive deeper into Sysco, you'd also look into what risks it is currently facing.

LUV 30-Year Financial DataThe intrinsic value of LUVSouthwest Airlines Co, the largest domestic air carrier in the United States, operates an all-Boeing 737 fleet of over 700 aircraft. The airline, predominantly specializing in short-haul, leisure flights, uses a point-to-point network and follows a low-cost carrier business model. Despite its current stock price of $27.18, our GF Value estimates the fair value at $61.85, indicating a significant undervaluation. This discrepancy sets the stage for a deeper exploration of the company's intrinsic value.Is Southwest Airlines Co (LUV) Significantly Undervalued? A Comprehensive AnalysisUnderstanding GF ValueThe GF Value is a unique measure of a stock's intrinsic value, calculated based on historical multiples, a GuruFocus adjustment factor, and future business performance estimates. The GF Value Line represents the fair value at which the stock should ideally be traded. If the stock price significantly deviates above the GF Value Line, it is overvalued, and its future return is likely to be poor. Conversely, if it is significantly below the GF Value Line, its future return will likely be higher.Southwest Airlines Co (NYSE:LUV) appears to be significantly undervalued according to our GF Value calculation. With its current price of $27.18 per share and a market cap of $16.20 billion, the stock's long-term return is likely to be much higher than its business growth due to its significant undervaluation.Is Southwest Airlines Co (LUV) Significantly Undervalued? A Comprehensive AnalysisLink: Find companies that may deliver higher future returns at reduced risk.Financial StrengthAssessing the financial strength of a company is crucial before investing in its stock. Companies with poor financial strength pose a higher risk of permanent loss. A great way to understand a company's financial strength is by examining its cash-to-debt ratio and interest coverage. With a cash-to-debt ratio of 1.31, Southwest Airlines Co ranks better than 72.38% of 934 companies in the Transportation industry. The overall financial strength of Southwest Airlines Co is 6 out of 10, indicating fair financial health.Story continuesIs Southwest Airlines Co (LUV) Significantly Undervalued? A Comprehensive AnalysisProfitability and GrowthInvesting in profitable companies, especially those demonstrating consistent long-term profitability, poses less risk. Companies with high profit margins are typically safer investments than those with low profit margins. Southwest Airlines Co has been profitable 9 out of the past 10 years. With a revenue of $25.10 billion over the past twelve months and an EPS of $0.88, its operating margin is 2.07%, ranking worse than 76.93% of 945 companies in the Transportation industry. However, its overall profitability is fair, with a rank of 7 out of 10.One of the most critical factors in a company's valuation is its growth. Companies that grow faster create more value for shareholders, especially if that growth is profitable. Southwest Airlines Co's average annual revenue growth is -3.8%, ranking worse than 70.96% of 909 companies in the Transportation industry. Its 3-year average EBITDA growth is -22.3%, which ranks worse than 89.84% of 817 companies in the Transportation industry.Another way to evaluate a company's profitability is by comparing its return on invested capital (ROIC) to its weighted average cost of capital (WACC). ROIC measures how well a company generates cash flow relative to the capital it has invested in its business. WACC is the rate that a company is expected to pay on average to all its security holders to finance its assets. If the ROIC exceeds the WACC, the company is likely creating value for its shareholders. In the past 12 months, Southwest Airlines Co's ROIC was 1.4 while its WACC was 7.6.Is Southwest Airlines Co (LUV) Significantly Undervalued? A Comprehensive AnalysisConclusionIn conclusion, Southwest Airlines Co (NYSE:LUV) appears to be significantly undervalued.

If you want to skip our introduction to the stock market, then check out 5 Best Cash App Stocks To Buy Now. Courtesy of the Internet and advancements in personal computing have made the modern day world connected in ways that were previously unimaginable. Just through a simple smartphone, users can access a treasure trove of information (and misinformation) that enables them to stay up to date with events all over the world.At the same time, the Internet, the computer, and the smartphone have also revolutionized the financial industry. Not only are investors able to make quick investment decisions based on near real time data, but the everyday consumer can also make payments from the comfort of their home or couch. Courtesy of platforms offered by companies such as Paypal Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:PYPL) allow people to manage their finances from their phones and even send and receive payments internationally.However, just as is the case with consumer discretionary stocks that see their fortunes rise and fall with the state of the economy, spending, and consumer purchasing power, cash app stocks are also bound by similar constraints. After all, a vibrant economy where incomes are rising, businesses are churning out more products, and inflation is not rising allows people with more leeway to buy products and services, which then increases their spending and by extension the revenue that cash app companies make. The revenues of such firms are typically from either a fixed fee or a percentage of the amount spent, and the relation of these platforms with the economy is also a key reason analysts often pour over the results of companies like Visa Inc. (NYSE:V) and Mastercard Incorporated (NYSE:MA) to gain insight into spending behaviors and try to decipher the direction in which the economy is headed.Another key aspect of the cash app industry is its potential to uproot the financial status quo enjoyed by traditional banks. Depending on which corner of the world you live in, opening a bank account is often not for the faint of heart and can require dealing with a laundry list of documents, uninformed branch personnel, and long delays. At the same time, unless an account holder is financially literate and can see through any hidden charges that a bank might be charging, maintaining a bank account can be a journey full of unwelcome surprises. On the other hand, the requirements to open a cash app account are lower, and they allow those out of the banking loop to easily receive payments.Story continuesPut together, these advantages and unique selling propositions of the cash app industry paint a rosy picture of its future. For instance, research suggests that 30% of retail spending across America is slated to shift over to cash apps by 2026, broadening the addressable market available to these companies and growing their revenue. Additionally, analysts from Wells Fargo also believe that the financial technology sector as a whole presents a $1.5 trillion market growth opportunity with a minimum of 6% growth until the end of this decade at least. The analysts ascribe this potential to the new features offered by financial payments platforms to retailers and merchants as well as the rising popularity of cryptocurrencies which can only be traded on a digital platform.Finally, before we take a look at the best cash app stocks, it's also important to take a look at the current economic environment. After all, more cash flowing through the economy naturally helps the cash app companies and a tighter monetary climate erodes the funds that both consumers and businesses can spend. After fresh job openings data from the Labor Department showed that openings soared to high levels, investors were unconvinced that the Federal Reserve might flirt with keeping interest rates the same in November. This causes stocks to slump and keeps credit expensive, which then reduces the ability of consumers to spend. However, on the positive side, inflation in America might finally be coming down. Data from the Commerce Department released on September 29th shows that the personal consumption expenditures (PCE) index rose by 0.1% in August over July for the slowest rise in years while the core PCE came out below 4% for the first time in years as well. This provides a small ray of hope that the Fed might not increase rates again soon and consumers might be able to spend more should rates come down earlier than expected.With these details in mind, let's take a look at the best cash app stocks to buy. Among these, the notable picks are Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), Alibaba Group Holding Limited (NYSE:BABA), and Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL).12 Best Cash App Stocks To Buy NowDenys Prykhodov / Shutterstock.comOur Methodology To compile our list of the best cash app stocks to buy, we first made a list of all companies that provide digital cash transfer and other services through a software application.

This 250,000-square-foot retail space, which welcomed first shoppers last Saturday, is poised to significantly boost the traffic of this retail center.The opening of SCHEELS at the Chandler Fashion Center marks a significant milestone for Macerich. This 32nd SCHEELS store replaces a former department store and is roughly 100,000 square feet larger than the prior anchor.The move aligns with Macerich's regional town center strategy, which aims to provide shoppers with more than just traditional retail options. This approach has been met with resounding success as tens of thousands of shoppers flocked to SCHEELS on its opening day, boosting foot traffic at the Chandler Fashion Center by more than 108% for the day.Chandler SCHEELS offers a diverse range of experiences, including a Ferris wheel, a 16,000-gallon saltwater aquarium, a wildlife mountain, Fuzziwig’s Candy Shop, Ginna’s Café, arcade games and sports simulators. This is in addition to 75 specialty shops set inside the sporting goods retailer.For investors eyeing Macerich, the addition of SCHEELS at the Chandler Fashion Center represents a promising opportunity. Ed Coppola, the president of Macerich, pointed out “SCHEELS is expected to generate four times what the previous tenant generated and add significant traffic to an already strong center.” This is expected to considerably enhance the shopping center's economic viability. The boost in foot traffic is poised to benefit not only SCHEELS but also other retailers within the Fashion Center, potentially translating into higher lease revenues for MAC.Chandler Fashion Center, already a prominent retail destination, boasts a diverse lineup of more than 180 retailers, including Apple, lululemon, Dillard’s, Macy’s and more. This retail diversity, coupled with the SCHEELS addition, positions the center as a resilient and attractive investment option.In the ever-evolving landscape of retail, adaptability and innovation are the key factors for success, and Macerich has time and again demonstrated these qualities, including the transformation of Kings Plaza in Brooklyn. The recent leasing successes and targeted renovations have not only revitalized the shopping center but also positioned Macerich as a dominant player in the New York City metro area.The highlight of this transformation is the fully remerchandised former Sears space at Kings Plaza, Brooklyn's only enclosed mall. Macerich's strategic leasing decisions have attracted prominent brands, and the stores now open in the former Sears box include a three-level Target, Primark, Zara and Burlington. These new stores are poised to deliver a combined annual sales figure nearly eight times higher than the previous Sears store.The success of Kings Plaza is not solely attributable to leasing changes. Targeted renovations have also played a pivotal role. MAC's commitment to enhancing the customer experience is evident in the complete transformation of the front of Kings Plaza along Flatbush Avenue in 2018. This redevelopment included the former Sears store, and it served as a catalyst for the mall's resurgence.Dwindling footfall, store closures and retailer bankruptcies were bothering the retail real estate industry in the past, and social distancing amid the pandemic further deteriorated the fundamentals, affecting retail REITs like Macerich, Simon Property Group SPG and Federal Realty FRT, among others. However, the renewed enthusiasm of shoppers seeking exclusive in-store shopping experiences after the pandemic has revived the fundamentals of this asset category, and Macerich, Simon Property and Federal Realty remain well-poised to benefit from strategic renovations and remerchandising.Shares of this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company have risen 2.9% in the past six months against its industry’s decline of 7.8%.

Investing in companies with poor financial strength have a higher risk of permanent loss. Looking at the cash-to-debt ratio and interest coverage is a great way to understand the financial strength of a company. PPG Industries has a cash-to-debt ratio of 0.17, which is worse than 82.22% of 1502 companies in the Chemicals industry. The overall financial strength of PPG Industries is 6 out of 10, which indicates that the financial strength of PPG Industries is fair.Is PPG Industries (PPG) a Hidden Bargain? An In-Depth Look at the 25% Margin of Safety Based on Its ValuationProfitability and Growth of PPG IndustriesInvesting in profitable companies carries less risk, especially in companies that have demonstrated consistent profitability over the long term. Typically, a company with high profit margins offers better performance potential than a company with low profit margins. PPG Industries has been profitable 10 years over the past 10 years. During the past 12 months, the company had revenues of $17.90 billion and Earnings Per Share (EPS) of $5.57. Its operating margin of 10.63% is better than 67.65% of 1521 companies in the Chemicals industry. Overall, GuruFocus ranks PPG Industries's profitability as strong.Growth is one of the most important factors in the valuation of a company. GuruFocus' research has found that growth is closely correlated with the long-term performance of a company's stock. If a company's business is growing, the company usually creates value for its shareholders, especially if the growth is profitable. Likewise, if a company's revenue and earnings are declining, the value of the company will decrease. PPG Industries's 3-year average revenue growth rate is worse than 64.5% of 1448 companies in the Chemicals industry. PPG Industries's 3-year average EBITDA growth rate is -2.9%, which ranks worse than 74.42% of 1337 companies in the Chemicals industry.ROIC vs WACC ComparisonAnother method of determining the profitability of a company is to compare its return on invested capital (ROIC) to the weighted average cost of capital. The ROIC measures how well a company generates cash flow relative to the capital it has invested in its business. The weighted average cost of capital (WACC) is the rate that a company is expected to pay on average to all its security holders to finance its assets. When the ROIC is higher than the WACC, it implies the company is creating value for shareholders. For the past 12 months, PPG Industries's return on invested capital is 9.29, and its cost of capital is 9.8.Is PPG Industries (PPG) a Hidden Bargain? An In-Depth Look at the 25% Margin of Safety Based on Its ValuationConclusionIn conclusion, the stock of PPG Industries (NYSE:PPG) is estimated to be modestly undervalued. The company's financial condition is fair, and its profitability is strong. Its growth ranks worse than 74.42% of 1337 companies in the Chemicals industry.

It’s undoubtedly a welcomed day of price action following a few weeks of volatility.And today, there were several high-flyers on the move, including Tesla TSLA, PPG Industries PPG, and American Airlines AAL. For those interested in momentum, let’s take a closer look at what’s moving each.Tesla Tesla saw negative coverage following the release of its Q3 EV production and deliveries results despite warning investors of a planned factory shutdown in the prior earnings call. The market has seemed to shrug off the news, with bulls re-taking control of shares.Regardless, the EV leader produced over 430,000 vehicles and delivered roughly 435,000 throughout Q3, reflecting a sequential decline. Still, the company’s 2023 volume target of 1.8 million vehicles remained unchanged, undoubtedly to the likes of investors.Despite the recent bounce, Tesla shares are down roughly 9% over the last three months, providing market participants an opportunity to buy shares at discounted levels.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchKeep an eye out for the company’s upcoming quarterly release expected on October 18th, as the Zacks Consensus EPS Estimate of $0.74 suggests a 30% pullback from the year-ago period. Analysts have taken their expectations lower following the previously announced factory shutdown, with the estimate down 14% since July.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchPPG IndustriesCitigroup maintained its buy rating of PPG shares but lowered its price target to $154 per share. Regardless, the updated PT reflects 16% upside from current levels, and investors shrugged off the cut, with PPG shares seeing positive price action.Still, it’s worth noting that PPG shares have recently broken through the 200-day moving average, a level that shares previously found support.Investors will likely be better off waiting until PPG shares can clear and hold the 200-day moving average, which would reflect a meaningful change in the current trend.Story continuesZacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchIn addition, the company is expected to see solid growth in its current fiscal year (FY23), with Zacks Consensus Estimates suggesting 24% earnings growth on 3% higher sales. Peeking a bit ahead, estimates allude to an additional 12% earnings growth in FY24 paired with a 3% revenue increase.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchAmerican AirlinesAmerican Airlines shares have faced notable selling pressure over the last several months following a hot start to 2023, now flat on a year-to-date basis. The company benefitted from a boom in travel demand, but worries of impending consumer weakness have recently taken hold of shares.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchIn fact, analysts have taken their earnings expectations lower across all timeframes, further reflecting the current negative sentiment.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchThe favorable price action in today’s session likely looks to be due to a technical bounce at previous support, as we can see illustrated below. Still, the negative earnings estimate revisions the company has seen remain a critical piece of the story, likely to continue weighing on near-term share performance.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchBottom LineThe market delivered a strong performance today, with green spread across many areas following a tough stretch over last the few weeks.And throughout the session, several stocks helped lead the general market higher, including Tesla TSLA, PPG Industries PPG, and American Airlines AAL.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

If you want to skip our introduction to the stock market, then check out 5 Best Cash App Stocks To Buy Now. Courtesy of the Internet and advancements in personal computing have made the modern day world connected in ways that were previously unimaginable. Just through a simple smartphone, users can access a treasure trove of information (and misinformation) that enables them to stay up to date with events all over the world.At the same time, the Internet, the computer, and the smartphone have also revolutionized the financial industry. Not only are investors able to make quick investment decisions based on near real time data, but the everyday consumer can also make payments from the comfort of their home or couch. Courtesy of platforms offered by companies such as Paypal Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:PYPL) allow people to manage their finances from their phones and even send and receive payments internationally.However, just as is the case with consumer discretionary stocks that see their fortunes rise and fall with the state of the economy, spending, and consumer purchasing power, cash app stocks are also bound by similar constraints. After all, a vibrant economy where incomes are rising, businesses are churning out more products, and inflation is not rising allows people with more leeway to buy products and services, which then increases their spending and by extension the revenue that cash app companies make. The revenues of such firms are typically from either a fixed fee or a percentage of the amount spent, and the relation of these platforms with the economy is also a key reason analysts often pour over the results of companies like Visa Inc. (NYSE:V) and Mastercard Incorporated (NYSE:MA) to gain insight into spending behaviors and try to decipher the direction in which the economy is headed.Another key aspect of the cash app industry is its potential to uproot the financial status quo enjoyed by traditional banks. Depending on which corner of the world you live in, opening a bank account is often not for the faint of heart and can require dealing with a laundry list of documents, uninformed branch personnel, and long delays. At the same time, unless an account holder is financially literate and can see through any hidden charges that a bank might be charging, maintaining a bank account can be a journey full of unwelcome surprises. On the other hand, the requirements to open a cash app account are lower, and they allow those out of the banking loop to easily receive payments.Story continuesPut together, these advantages and unique selling propositions of the cash app industry paint a rosy picture of its future. For instance, research suggests that 30% of retail spending across America is slated to shift over to cash apps by 2026, broadening the addressable market available to these companies and growing their revenue. Additionally, analysts from Wells Fargo also believe that the financial technology sector as a whole presents a $1.5 trillion market growth opportunity with a minimum of 6% growth until the end of this decade at least. The analysts ascribe this potential to the new features offered by financial payments platforms to retailers and merchants as well as the rising popularity of cryptocurrencies which can only be traded on a digital platform.Finally, before we take a look at the best cash app stocks, it's also important to take a look at the current economic environment. After all, more cash flowing through the economy naturally helps the cash app companies and a tighter monetary climate erodes the funds that both consumers and businesses can spend. After fresh job openings data from the Labor Department showed that openings soared to high levels, investors were unconvinced that the Federal Reserve might flirt with keeping interest rates the same in November. This causes stocks to slump and keeps credit expensive, which then reduces the ability of consumers to spend. However, on the positive side, inflation in America might finally be coming down. Data from the Commerce Department released on September 29th shows that the personal consumption expenditures (PCE) index rose by 0.1% in August over July for the slowest rise in years while the core PCE came out below 4% for the first time in years as well. This provides a small ray of hope that the Fed might not increase rates again soon and consumers might be able to spend more should rates come down earlier than expected.With these details in mind, let's take a look at the best cash app stocks to buy. Among these, the notable picks are Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), Alibaba Group Holding Limited (NYSE:BABA), and Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL).12 Best Cash App Stocks To Buy NowDenys Prykhodov / Shutterstock.comOur Methodology To compile our list of the best cash app stocks to buy, we first made a list of all companies that provide digital cash transfer and other services through a software application.

One such stock that merits attention is SLB (NYSE:SLB). The stock, which is currently priced at 56.75, recorded a loss of 3.17% in a day and a 3-month increase of 18.97%. The stock's fair valuation is $125.82, as indicated by its GF Value.Understanding the GF ValueWarning! GuruFocus has detected 4 Warning Sign with SLB. Click here to check it out. SLB 30-Year Financial DataThe intrinsic value of SLBThe GF Value represents the current intrinsic value of a stock derived from our exclusive method. The GF Value Line on our summary page gives an overview of the fair value that the stock should be traded at. It is calculated based on three factors:1. Historical multiples (PE Ratio, PS Ratio, PB Ratio and Price-to-Free-Cash-Flow) that the stock has traded at.2. GuruFocus adjustment factor based on the company's past returns and growth.3. Future estimates of the business performance.We believe the GF Value Line is the fair value that the stock should be traded at. The stock price will most likely fluctuate around the GF Value Line. If the stock price is significantly above the GF Value Line, it is overvalued and its future return is likely to be poor. On the other hand, if it is significantly below the GF Value Line, its future return will likely be higher.SLB (SLB): A Smart Investment or a Value Trap? An In-Depth ExplorationPotential Risks of SLB (NYSE:SLB)However, investors need to consider a more in-depth analysis before making an investment decision. Despite its seemingly attractive valuation, certain risk factors associated with SLB should not be ignored. These risks are primarily reflected through its low Piotroski F-score and Beneish M-score. Moreover, the company's revenues and earnings have been on a downward trend over the past five years, which raises a crucial question: Is SLB a hidden gem or a value trap?These indicators suggest that SLB, despite its apparent undervaluation, might be a potential value trap. This complexity underlines the importance of thorough due diligence in investment decision-making.Story continuesA Closer Look at SLBSLB, formerly known as Schlumberger, is the largest oilfield service firm in the world, with expertise in myriad disciplines, including reservoir performance, well construction, production enhancement, and more recently, digital solutions. It maintains a reputation as one of the industry's leading innovators, which has earned it dominant share in numerous end markets. Despite its market position, the company's declining revenues and earnings signal potential risks.SLB (SLB): A Smart Investment or a Value Trap? An In-Depth ExplorationDeclining Revenues: A Red FlagOne of the telltale indicators of a company's potential trouble is a sustained decline in revenues. In the case of SLB, both the revenue per share (evident from the last five years' TTM data: 2019: 23.55; 2020: 21.34; 2021: 15.40; 2022: 17.30; 2023: 21.63; ) and the 5-year revenue growth rate (-5.7%) have been on a consistent downward trajectory. This pattern may point to underlying challenges such as diminishing demand for SLB's products, or escalating competition in its market sector. Either scenario can pose serious risks to the company's future performance, warranting a thorough analysis by investors.SLB (SLB): A Smart Investment or a Value Trap? An In-Depth ExplorationSluggish Earnings Growth: A Cause for ConcernDespite its low price-to-fair-value ratio, SLB's falling revenues and earnings cast a long shadow over its investment attractiveness. A low price relative to intrinsic value can indeed suggest an investment opportunity, but only if the company's fundamentals are sound or improving. In Steelcase's case, the declining revenues, EBITDA, and earnings growth suggest that the company's issues may be more than just cyclical fluctuations.Without a clear turnaround strategy, there's a risk that the company's performance could continue to deteriorate, leading to further price declines. In such a scenario, the low price-to-GF-Value ratio may be more indicative of a value trap than a value opportunity.ConclusionWhile SLB (NYSE:SLB) may initially appear as an attractive investment opportunity due to its low price-to-fair-value ratio, a deeper analysis reveals several red flags. The consistent decline in revenues and earnings, coupled with a low Piotroski F-score and Beneish M-score, suggest that SLB may be a potential value trap. Therefore, investors should exercise caution and conduct thorough due diligence before making an investment decision.Investors can find stocks with good revenue and earnings growth using GuruFocus' Peter Lynch Growth with Low Valuation Screener.This article first appeared on GuruFocus.]"

101,c1ba8a2b-0422-3ae6-b141-c9b2cde5494e,AIG,2023-10-05,Investors in American International Group (NYSE:AIG) have seen stellar returns of 116% over the past three years,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/investors-american-international-group-nyse-120056836.html,1696507256,STORY,['AIG'],"[The worst result, after buying shares in a company (assuming no leverage), would be if you lose all the money you put in. But in contrast you can make much more than 100% if the company does well. For instance the American International Group, Inc. (NYSE:AIG) share price is 101% higher than it was three years ago. That sort of return is as solid as granite. The last week saw the share price soften some 2.7%.So let's investigate and see if the longer term performance of the company has been in line with the underlying business' progress. View our latest analysis for American International Group In his essay The Superinvestors of Graham-and-Doddsville Warren Buffett described how share prices do not always rationally reflect the value of a business. One imperfect but simple way to consider how the market perception of a company has shifted is to compare the change in the earnings per share (EPS) with the share price movement.American International Group became profitable within the last three years. That kind of transition can be an inflection point that justifies a strong share price gain, just as we have seen here.The company's earnings per share (over time) is depicted in the image below (click to see the exact numbers).earnings-per-share-growthIt is of course excellent to see how American International Group has grown profits over the years, but the future is more important for shareholders. You can see how its balance sheet has strengthened (or weakened) over time in this free interactive graphic.What About Dividends?It is important to consider the total shareholder return, as well as the share price return, for any given stock. Whereas the share price return only reflects the change in the share price, the TSR includes the value of dividends (assuming they were reinvested) and the benefit of any discounted capital raising or spin-off. It's fair to say that the TSR gives a more complete picture for stocks that pay a dividend. In the case of American International Group, it has a TSR of 116% for the last 3 years. That exceeds its share price return that we previously mentioned. And there's no prize for guessing that the dividend payments largely explain the divergence!Story continuesA Different PerspectiveIt's good to see that American International Group has rewarded shareholders with a total shareholder return of 19% in the last twelve months. And that does include the dividend. That gain is better than the annual TSR over five years, which is 5%. Therefore it seems like sentiment around the company has been positive lately. Given the share price momentum remains strong, it might be worth taking a closer look at the stock, lest you miss an opportunity. I find it very interesting to look at share price over the long term as a proxy for business performance. But to truly gain insight, we need to consider other information, too. Consider risks, for instance.

Discovery WBD announced that it is raising the cost of a new ad-free monthly subscription for Discovery+ in the United States and Canada. From Oct 3, the price of the monthly subscription increased from $6.99 to $8.99, with applicable taxes. However, the ad-lite subscription has been unchanged at $4.99 per month.In Canada, the price of a new ad-free monthly subscription for Discovery+ increased from CAD $6.99 to CAD $8.99. The cost of a new ad-lite subscription also increased from CAD $4.99 to CAD $5.99.Existing subscribers will experience the price increase in their monthly billing cycle on or after Nov 2.This is the first time that Discovery+ has raised the monthly subscriptions in these regions since its launch in January 2021. This adjustment enables the provider to consistently deliver compelling content across various genres, such as food, home, relationships, true crime and the paranormal.Warner Bros. Discovery, Inc. Price and Consensus Warner Bros. Discovery, Inc. Price and ConsensusWarner Bros. Discovery, Inc. price-consensus-chart | Warner Bros. Discovery, Inc. QuoteStreaming Giants Increase Subscription Rates to Meet Production CostsIn recent years, the streaming TV has become increasingly competitive, leading Hollywood companies to invest billions in creating its own streaming platforms and content libraries in order to compete with Netflix NFLX.Consequently, the cost of participating in the streaming era has steadily risen. Streaming companies are finding it difficult to balance between making money and content spending to aid subscriber growth. Streaming giants have already increased their prices and are looking for other ways, such as merchandising and providing ad-supported tiers, to boost revenues.Netflix has raised its subscription prices several times since its launch. Netflix raised its prices in January 2022 and has put restrictions on password sharing. Individuals who previously used streaming accounts paid by people living in different households are now required to have their own subscriptions. This change originated with NFLX, which no longer permits subscribers to share their accounts with individuals who do not reside in the same household.Disney’s DIS streaming platforms, such as Disney+, Hulu and ESPN+, have also become more expensive as DIS has focused more on streaming. Disney is set to increase the prices of its ad-free versions of Disney+ and Hulu once again, starting Oct 12. Disney+ will be priced at $13.99 per month and Hulu's no-ads tier will be available for $17.99 per month. The ad-supported tiers of both services will continue to be priced at $7.99 for the time being.Paramount’s PARA online streaming service provider, Paramount+, has also increased its monthly charges like other platforms in the online streaming market. On Jun 27, Paramount+ implemented a price hike coinciding with the launch of Paramount+ with Showtime integration. This change raised the cost of the current ad-supported essential plan from $4.99 to $5.99 per month and the premium plan increased from $9.99 to $11.99 per month, now including Showtime as part of the premium offering.Warner Bros. Discovery is set to follow the steps of other streaming services by putting a stop on password sharing. This will boost direct-to-consumer (DTC) subscribers as well as revenues in the upcoming quarters.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for WBD’s 2023 total DTC subscribers is pegged at 96,562, indicating year-over-year growth of 0.48%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues is pegged at $41.94 billion, indicating year-over-year growth of 24.01%.Shares of this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company have gained 9.2% year to date compared with the Zacks Consumer Discretionary sector’s rise of 4.5% due to steady growth in DTC subscribers and revenues in the previous quarters.

That’s already substantially higher than the $8 the company charged in 2019.The amount Netflix might raise prices was not disclosed.Streaming services, across the board, have been raising prices, including Warner Bros. Discovery’s announcement on Tuesday that the cost of Discovery+ would jump from $6.99 per month to $8.99 per month for ad-free subscribers.Still, with Netflix so prominent in the negotiations with SAG-AFTRA, the actors’ union, as well as with the Writers Guild of America, which recently reached an agreement with studios, the timing of this increase could cause some consumer ill will.Netflix, earlier this year, did away with its $10 Basic ad-free tier. And months before that, the company began to crack down on password sharing. Netflix is in the midst of a push to increase its revenues and subscriptions after they began to taper off at the end of the pandemic.The push has worked, though. Netflix began its enforcement of no password sharing on May 23.

Media reports about these brokerage-firm-employed (or sell-side) analysts changing their ratings often affect a stock's price. Do they really matter, though?Before we discuss the reliability of brokerage recommendations and how to use them to your advantage, let's see what these Wall Street heavyweights think about Netflix (NFLX).Netflix currently has an average brokerage recommendation (ABR) of 1.97, on a scale of 1 to 5 (Strong Buy to Strong Sell), calculated based on the actual recommendations (Buy, Hold, Sell, etc.) made by 35 brokerage firms. An ABR of 1.97 approximates between Strong Buy and Buy.Of the 35 recommendations that derive the current ABR, 20 are Strong Buy, representing 57.1% of all recommendations.Brokerage Recommendation Trends for NFLXBroker Rating Breakdown Chart for NFLXCheck price target &amp; stock forecast for Netflix here&gt;&gt;&gt;The ABR suggests buying Netflix, but making an investment decision solely on the basis of this information might not be a good idea. According to several studies, brokerage recommendations have little to no success guiding investors to choose stocks with the most potential for price appreciation.Are you wondering why? The vested interest of brokerage firms in a stock they cover often results in a strong positive bias of their analysts in rating it. Our research shows that for every ""Strong Sell"" recommendation, brokerage firms assign five ""Strong Buy"" recommendations.This means that the interests of these institutions are not always aligned with those of retail investors, giving little insight into the direction of a stock's future price movement. It would therefore be best to use this information to validate your own analysis or a tool that has proven to be highly effective at predicting stock price movements.Zacks Rank, our proprietary stock rating tool with an impressive externally audited track record, categorizes stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), and is an effective indicator of a stock's price performance in the near future. Therefore, using the ABR to validate the Zacks Rank could be an efficient way of making a profitable investment decision.Story continuesZacks Rank Should Not Be Confused With ABRIn spite of the fact that Zacks Rank and ABR both appear on a scale from 1 to 5, they are two completely different measures.The ABR is calculated solely based on brokerage recommendations and is typically displayed with decimals (example: 1.28). In contrast, the Zacks Rank is a quantitative model allowing investors to harness the power of earnings estimate revisions. It is displayed in whole numbers -- 1 to 5.Analysts employed by brokerage firms have been and continue to be overly optimistic with their recommendations. Since the ratings issued by these analysts are more favorable than their research would support because of the vested interest of their employers, they mislead investors far more often than they guide.In contrast, the Zacks Rank is driven by earnings estimate revisions. And near-term stock price movements are strongly correlated with trends in earnings estimate revisions, according to empirical research.Furthermore, the different grades of the Zacks Rank are applied proportionately across all stocks for which brokerage analysts provide earnings estimates for the current year. In other words, at all times, this tool maintains a balance among the five ranks it assigns.There is also a key difference between the ABR and Zacks Rank when it comes to freshness. When you look at the ABR, it may not be up-to-date. Nonetheless, since brokerage analysts constantly revise their earnings estimates to reflect changing business trends, and their actions get reflected in the Zacks Rank quickly enough, it is always timely in predicting future stock prices.Is NFLX Worth Investing In?Looking at the earnings estimate revisions for Netflix, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has declined 0.1% over the past month to $11.91.Analysts' growing pessimism over the company's earnings prospects, as indicated by strong agreement among them in revising EPS estimates lower, could be a legitimate reason for the stock to plunge in the near term.The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) for Netflix.

The company's sales in the quarter slumped by about 30%. The shares down 7% on the day here. Average selling prices for shell eggs have returned to more normalized levels, said the CEO Sherman Miller. And the overall egg supply is recovering from avian influenza.You know, we've been watching egg prices so closely. They were really a big headline there and part of CPI for a while. That was good news for Cal-Maine for a little bit, right? I mean, not easy to deal with an avian influenza outbreak but from a price perspective was positive. And so normalization in their case is not necessarily good for their sales.JOSH LIPTON: Yeah. Reported earnings and missed sales down about 30%. And to your point, the average egg prices apparently down to 159 per dozen from 228 in the year ago period. Good news for me and my breakfast every morning, not so much for them.JULIE HYMAN: Are you an egg guy every day?JOSH LIPTON: Great egg guy, huge egg guy. Oh, yeah. You just combine it with, you know, your 40 milligrams of Lipitor, and you're fine. That's the idea.JULIE HYMAN: I don't-- I think that's an old way--JOSH LIPTON: Isn't that what doctors advise?JULIE HYMAN: No, that's an old way of thinking.Story continuesJOSH LIPTON: Oh, is it?JULIE HYMAN: I don't think there's such a concern about eggs and cholesterol anymore.JOSH LIPTON: Don't be slandering the eggs. I should be saying.JULIE HYMAN: I think eggs--JOSH LIPTON: I'll stand downJULIE HYMAN: --eggs are OK now. I don't know. All right.JOSH LIPTON: Moving on Lithium Americas splits into two separate publicly traded companies. Shares surging as Lithium Americas separates from its Argentine segment. So this one, Lithium Mining startup now transforming into two companies, Julie. And I guess spinning off Lithium Americas Argentina to shareholders. So if you want to invest in lithium, critical for EVs, here's your chance.JULIE HYMAN: So Lithium Americas owns the Thacker Pass Project, which is in Nevada. And this is something they've been working on for a while, because just like we are trying to get all kinds of supply chain things based or reshored here in the US, lithium is among them. Obviously, there's a huge demand for lithium because of batteries, particularly for electric cars. So this has been something that has been sort of a speculative play, because it's not yet producing lithium at that mine as of yet, because it's still under construction. But it's been an interesting story.But you can see the shares falling of Lithium America as that split goes into effect. We've been watching a lot of splits over the past week or so.JOSH LIPTON: It's been a theme.JULIE HYMAN: And many of them have not been doing well.JOSH LIPTON: No, no.JULIE HYMAN: So it's been an interesting space to watch now, but we're going to continue to watch lithium one. We also are going to continue to watch energy stocks. Now, I was just talking about what was going on with them in terms of the overall sectors feeling the pressure in today's trading session. Oil prices pulling back from their 2023 highs last month. Exxon just one example, down by 4% here. But it has really been an interesting day for many of these.And if you take a look inside the YFi interactive again, just to look at the sectors and get some perspective on what's been happening. So the XLE, that's today here for the XLE. But if you take it out to three months. And you will see a very different picture, where you have seen it as the best performing sector in the S&amp;P 500. And that's because of what we have been seeing with oil prices, right?Here's another look at that three months on an individual basis. So there's the heat map of all the big energy names on that three-month basis. If you look year-to-date, it is not as clear what's been going on. But really, the surge has been coming in the past few months for many of these companies.Here's ExxonMobil, for example, that's the daily chart. If you look at year-to-date, you can see zig-zag but really coming up from the high-- from the lows in July and recovering since that time.JOSH LIPTON: Yeah. The decline in oil price is just sending energy stocks lower across the board here. You point out Chevron, Exxon, Occidental Petroleum, take your name. We mentioned JPMorgan at the beginning of the show and their take on this. Their year-end target, 86 per barrel. So if you're an investor, you're trying to find the stocks that can work in that universe, you've got to maybe pick your spots. We had Neil Dingmann from Truist, though, giving us some names.JULIE HYMAN: He did. And Conoco was among them. He said you want the lower cost oil producers that are able to get more margins out of that oil they're taken out of the ground.]"

This company, which is in the Zacks Oil and Gas - Refining and Marketing industry, shows potential for another earnings beat.When looking at the last two reports, this oil refiner has recorded a strong streak of surpassing earnings estimates. The company has topped estimates by 13.46%, on average, in the last two quarters.For the last reported quarter, Phillips 66 came out with earnings of $3.87 per share versus the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $3.54 per share, representing a surprise of 9.32%. For the previous quarter, the company was expected to post earnings of $3.58 per share and it actually produced earnings of $4.21 per share, delivering a surprise of 17.60%.For Phillips 66, estimates have been trending higher, thanks in part to this earnings surprise history. And when you look at the stock's positive Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction), it's a great indicator of a future earnings beat, especially when combined with its solid Zacks Rank.Our research shows that stocks with the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time. In other words, if you have 10 stocks with this combination, the number of stocks that beat the consensus estimate could be as high as seven.The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is related to change. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Phillips 66 currently has an Earnings ESP of +3.47%, which suggests that analysts have recently become bullish on the company's earnings prospects. This positive Earnings ESP when combined with the stock's Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) indicates that another beat is possibly around the corner. We expect the company's next earnings report to be released on October 27, 2023.Story continuesInvestors should note, however, that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss, but a negative value does reduce the predictive power of this metric.Many companies end up beating the consensus EPS estimate, but that may not be the sole basis for their stocks moving higher. On the other hand, some stocks may hold their ground even if they end up missing the consensus estimate.Because of this, it's really important to check a company's Earnings ESP ahead of its quarterly release to increase the odds of success.

They analyzed the proteins in the context of diseases and diversity in the sequence of the genome and compared measurements made using two platforms of thousands of proteins in samples from large groups from the UK Biobank and Iceland.Kari Stefansson, Grimur Hjorleifsson and Patrick Sulem, scientists at deCODE genetics and authors on the paper.In an article revealed today in Nature, scientists from deCODE Genetics, a subsidiary of the pharmaceutical company Amgen, demonstrated how plasma proteomics can contribute to a better understanding of diseases. The study's focus on the plasma proteome led the team to find associations between various diseases and the levels of specific proteins. ""Measuring a great number of proteins in a population-based cohort enables the discovery of circulating biomarkers and the early detection of disease,"" says Patrick Sulem, scientist at deCODE genetics and one of the senior authors on the paper.Additionally, the scientists leveraged genetic factors influencing protein levels to illuminate the biological ties between sequence variant associations and pathogenesis of disease occurrence. ""The biological relationship between an association of a sequence variant with disease can often be elusive. Incorporating proteo-genomics into the analysis can uncover the molecular mechanisms of disease development,"" says Kári Stefánsson, scientist at deCODE genetics.The scientists analyzed data from about 50,000 individuals of European, African and Asian ancestry from the UK Biobank, using 2,941 immunoassays on the Olink Explore platform. The data were generated by the UK Biobank Pharma Proteomics Project (UKB-PPP), a consortium of thirteen biopharmaceutical companies, including Amgen, studying circulating protein biomarkers. The authors compared these findings to a previous study where they analyzed data from around 40,000 Icelanders using 4,907 aptamer-based assays on the SomaScan platform. In total they identified over 80,000 associations between sequence variants and protein levels and over 500,000 associations of diseases and other traits with protein levels.Story continuesThe scientists observed discrepancies  in the measurements of protein levels when a subset of samples was examined using both platforms. These differences between platforms affected the discovery of circulating disease biomarkers and the detection of genetic factors that influence both protein levels and disease manifestation at the same time. By examining large cohorts in Iceland and the UK, a substantial number of associations could be detected, making the comparison meaningful. The authors emphasized the value of validation of individual assays on a case-by-case basis.""While these two proteomics platforms serve as useful instruments for simultaneous testing of thousands of proteins in large datasets, careful validation is necessary for individual proteins,"" says Kári Stefánsson, CEO of deCODE genetics and one of the senior authors on the paper.Based in Reykjavik, Iceland, deCODE is a global leader in analyzing and understanding the human genome. Using its unique expertise and population resources, deCODE has discovered genetic risk factors for dozens of common diseases. The purpose of understanding the genetics of disease is to use that information to create new means of diagnosing, treating and preventing disease. deCODE is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Amgen (NASDAQ: AMGN).deCODE genetics logo with Amgen SOURCE deCODE genetics]"

The S&amp;P 500 (^GSPC) and the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) both were down a modest 0.1%.A pullback in bond yields' blistering rally has brought some relief to battered stocks, and the 10-year Treasury yield (^TNX) was slightly lower after losing hold of 16-year highs the previous session.Data showed US weekly jobless claims ticked higher last week but undershot economists' expectations.

The Coca-Cola Company (KO), Pepsico (PEP): Shares of American multinational corporations Coke and Pepsi both dipped around 5% each amid greater volatility in the consumer staples sector.

If you are very bullish here, this is the group for you.""Colas and Datatrek aren't bullish on the financials as they believe the Fed needs to be closer to cutting interest rates before it's time to buy bank stocks. Additionally, if something in the economy is required to ""break"" in order for the Fed to start that cutting cycle, it will likely include banks, per Datatrek.""If higher yields cause a recession, then loan losses will rise,"" Colas wrote.

Jlast monthJosh SchaferHigher treasury yields could keep Fed on pause, Fed's Daly saysWhile treasury yields hovering near 16-year highs has weighed on stocks, it could be good news for investors hoping the Federal Reserve is done hiking interest rates.Yahoo Finance's Jennifer Schonberger reports:San Francisco Fed President Mary Daly said Thursday if long-term bond yields remain around current levels, then the Federal Reserve won’t need to raise interest rates again.“The bond market has tightened quite considerably over about 36 basis points since we met in September,” Daly said at the Economic Club of New York. “That is equivalent to about a rate hike. So then the need to do tightening additionally is not there.”Long-term interest rates are at their highest levels since 2007 following a recent run-up. This past month 10-year Treasury yields have risen more than half a percentage point to surpass 4.7%.Daly, a non-voting member of the Fed interest rate setting committee who has been more hawkish this year, noted that if the job market and inflation continue to slow and if financial conditions, which have tightened in the past 90 days, remain tight, then the need for the Fed to take further action is diminished.""Financial markets are already moving in that direction and then they've done the work. We don't need to do it more,"" she said.Fed officials penciled in one more rate hike this year to a range of 5.5%-5.75% before holding rates at that level into next year. Wall Street sees a nearly 80% chance of holding rates at current levels in November.The Fed has raised rates 11 times since March 2022 in the most aggressive rate-hiking campaign since the 1980s. While inflation has dropped, it remains around 4%, around double the Fed’s target.Jlast monthJosh SchaferMortgage rates creep closer to 8%Mortgage rates are still chugging higher as fears about 8% rates are swirling. One economist says that would take a further tick higher in the 10-year Treasury yield.Gabriella Cruz-Martinez reports:Mortgage rates jumped again this week — remaining at a 23-year high and increasing the likelihood that rates could soon hit 8%.The rate on the average 30-year fixed mortgage increased to 7.49% from 7.31% the previous week, according to Freddie Mac, following the yield of the 10-year Treasury, which spiked to a 16-year high this week. Rates are at their highest point since December 2000 for a second week in a row, with few signs of softening.Steeper rates continue to smother homebuyer demand, forcing the price-conscious to the sidelines. Meanwhile, those still on the hunt leaned on lower-rate options, eager to lock in before rates surge higher.“At the beginning of the year, it was widely expected that mortgage rates would fall to around 6% by the end of 2023. However, now the question is whether rates will hit 8% this year,” Lisa Sturtevant, chief economist at Bright MLS, a real estate data provider, said in an emailed statement. “The gap between the yield on the 10-year Treasury and the rate on a 30-year fixed rate mortgage has been around 3 percentage points, so as the Treasury yield approaches 5%, an 8% mortgage rate does not seem unlikely.”Jlast monthJosh SchaferStocks lower in afternoon tradeStocks are lower on Thursday as investor focus shifts to a highly anticipated September jobs report due out on Friday.The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) was down about 0.4% while the S&amp;P 500 (^GSPC) and he tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) dropped roughly 0.5%.After a surge in oil prices and bond yields had weighed on stocks in recent days, both were trading lower on Thursday.Jlast monthJosh SchaferFriday's jobs report could be bad for stocks no matter what it revealsStocks are lower on Thursday as investors eagerly await the September jobs report on Friday morning. But with the Fed's rate hike path in focus, the details of that report could spook investors.Yahoo Finance's Jared Blikre explains:Friday's monthly jobs report from the Bureau of Labor could be a catalyzing event after Wednesday's employment report from ADP materially missed expectations.If the data comes in hot, Peccatiello said, investors would likely chase yields higher until they finally become a chokepoint in the markets. A 5% yield really ""starts to become a real burden for risk assets,"" said Peccatiello.On the other hand, if the headline payroll number comes in weak (much less negative), the weakening labor market could signal a recession is near, which would also send stocks and rates down.Peccatiello acknowledged the irony of the situation, saying: ""Too hot a number [or] too cold a number — it's bad for stocks.""A ""just right"" Goldilocks report merely kicks the can to the next potential catalyst.Jlast monthJosh SchaferJobless claims signal 'very few layoffs' in US economyInitial jobless claims for the week ending September 30 were 207,000, slightly below expectations for 210,000.Claims have largely been in a range of about 200,000 to 250,000 over the past year. Economists believe the limited pickup off the 52-week lows for claims shows that while the labor market be starting to cool, that hasn't mean widespread job loss for American workers.""There are still very few layoffs,"" Oxford economics lead US economist Michael Pearce wrote in a research note Thursday. ""We expect some increase in claims over the coming months as job growth slows further but, for now, labor market conditions are still easing without a significant rise in unemployment.""Jlast monthJosh SchaferStocks roughly flat at open as markets await Jobs reportStocks are in the red at the market open on Thursday as investor focus shifts to a highly anticipated September jobs report due out on Friday.The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) and the S&amp;P 500 (^GSPC) were roughly flat at the open on Thursday, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) dropped about 0.1%.Meanwhile, after reaching 16-year highs on Tuesday, 10-year (^TNX) and 30-year Treasury yields (^TYX) were roughly flat on Thursday.

To skip the detailed analysis of the renewable energy industry, go directly to the 5 Best Clean Energy Stocks To Buy According to Wall Street Analysts.September was an underwhelming month for the market as the S&amp;P 500 showed a 5.25% decline during the month. On September 27, the US 10-year Treasury note reached its highest level since 2007 while the S&amp;P 500 Utilities Index hit its lowest intraday since March 2021. Similarly, it was a bad month for the renewable energy sector as a whole too. The Invesco Global Clean Energy UCITS ETF Acc registered an approximately 11.5% decline and Fidelity Clean Energy ETF was down by around 10.75% between September 1 and September 29.Nevertheless, renewable energy is a growing trend in the global market. According to Grand View Research, the sector is expected to grow at a compound annual growth rate of 16.9% between 2023 and 2030. The clean energy sector picked up its pace after the fossil fuel price boom due to the Russia-Ukraine war. Moreover, the sector could see another surge as per barrel oil prices increased again which could create a decline in demand for fossil fuels. The front-month WTI crude oil and front-month Brent crude closed the third quarter at $90.79 per barrel and $95.31 per barrel, respectively.In 2023, there have been several growth catalysts for the clean energy market as the European Union (EU) reached a provisional deal to increase the percentage of renewable energy in its total energy mix from its current target of 32% to 42.5% by 2030. The EU is already looking to add up to 68 gigawatts (GW) of wind and solar capacity in 2023, up 17% YoY. Earlier in September, the G20 countries agreed to triple the renewable energy capacity by 2030.According to Deloitte, renewable energy growth slowed down in the US in 2022. Nonetheless, if we look at the numbers, the growth has still been quite significant. The clean energy investments in the United States increased to $141 billion in 2022, and the sector accounted for 41% of the total energy mix. The US has been focusing on increasing its renewable capacity for a very long time. According to Section 203 of the Energy Policy Act of 2005, at least 7.5% of the total energy used annually by the Federal Government should be accounted for by renewable energy. On top of that, the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 has also become an extra incentive for energy companies to add more renewable energy to their mix.Story continuesEnergy companies all around the world are focusing on increasing their clean energy capacity. The American utility company, NextEra Energy, Inc. (NYSE:NEE), is planning to reach “Real Zero” by 2045, which means that it plans to completely eliminate carbon emissions from its operations by that time. On the other hand, the oil and gas company, BP p.l.c. (NYSE:BP), is planning to develop nearly 50 GW of net renewable generating capacity globally by 2030.Similar to this list of clean energy stocks that Wall Street analysts find undervalued, you can also check out the list of undervalued renewable energy stocks according to hedge funds.

The lack of change in loyalty is a positive sign for the industry, which had been facing sharp decreases in loyalty due to pandemic-related inventory shortages.A primary contributor to halting declines were luxury brands, which saw a 2.7 percentage point (PP) increase in brand loyalty year-over-year. The mainstream sector, which accounts for the largest source of consumer return-to-market volume, saw brand loyalty decline by 0.4 PP over the same period. Inconsistent improvements in available inventory were the primary factors in loyalty gains and losses for the first half of 2023.""Rising inventory levels are helping to curb the loyalty declines we've seen in previous years,"" said Vince Palomarez, associate director, Loyalty product management at S&amp;P Global Mobility.

""This has opened the door for more brands to capture market share from traditional leaders. Years of investment in quality and technology among the industry has evened the playing field, and we are seeing some of the smaller brands take advantage of that.""Story continuesAmong individual brands, Tesla remains the leader with a loyalty rate of 68.4% for the first half of 2023. While all models in Tesla's lineup have high retention rates, the Model 3 stands out as the clear leader with more than 74% of its returning consumers remaining loyal to the brand – mostly by acquiring a Model Y.""Tesla has proven it has a strong connection with its customers, despite increasing competition in the BEV market,"" said Palomarez.

Increases were $63.9 billion versus $86.7 billion, and decreases were $26.4 billion compared to $15.2 billion.""Dividend payments picked up in the third quarter as increases bounced back from their Q2 decline.  However, dividend decreases significantly picked up, which reduced the net gain to shareholders,"" said Howard Silverblatt, Senior Index Analyst at S&amp;P Dow Jones Indices. ""The increases were supported by T-Mobile's $3.1 billion dividend initiation, which was only second to Apple's $9.9 billion initiation in March 2012, and Microsoft's $2.1 billion increase - its largest annual increase since it initiated dividends in January 2003. Absent these two, the quarterly increases portray a cautious corporate approach to longer-term dividend commitments.""Story continuesSilverblatt continued: ""Given the acceptance of higher-for-longer interest rates, the impact on consumer spending, and the uncertainty surrounding the economy, a more cautious level of dividend commitments seems justified for the short-term. For Q4 2023, the dollar aggregate of dividends are expected to increase. Absent an economic event, they could even set a dividend payment record for the S&amp;P 500 Q4 period as large caps appear to be weathering the uncertainties better than others. This result would make 2023 the 14th consecutive year of dividend increases for the index, and the 12th consecutive record year. For 2024, we expect companies to remain cautious over both consumer and government spending, and consider any impact of the political environment. This could result in restrained net dividend increases, posting a 3.5%-4.5% increase in actual cash payments for 2024 over 2023.""S&amp;P 500 DividendsOn a per share basis, S&amp;P 500 Q3 2023 dividend payments increased 0.7% to $17.26 per share, from the Q2 2023's $17.13 and were up 3.6% from Q3 2022's $16.66 payment. On an aggregate basis, index constituents paid $144.2 billion in dividends for the quarter, up from the $143.2 billion paid in Q2 2023 and up from $140.3 billion in Q3 2022.

One index shows chicken producer profit margins at their highest in a year.U.S. consumption of chicken is expected to exceed 100 pounds per person this year for the first time ever, data from the U.S. Department of Agriculture shows.Beef consumption is forecast to drop to its lowest since 2018, as prices climb due to dwindling cattle supplies. Meanwhile, consumer spending cuts have knocked pork consumption to the lowest since 2015.Arkansas-based Tyson, which sells all three types of meat, had to deal with a glut of chicken after earning massive profits when meat prices soared during the COVID-19 pandemic.The company announced the closures of six U.S. chicken plants with nearly 4,700 employees this year to reduce costs. Its chicken business likely returned to profitability in the quarter ended Sept. 30 after two quarters of operating losses, analysts said.Tightening supplies now favor producers' bottom lines.U.S. facilities that hatch chicken eggs placed about 2.8% fewer eggs in incubators in the six weeks ending on Sept. 23, compared to a year earlier, according to U.S. government data. That was a sharp turnaround from the same period in 2022, when hatcheries set 3.6% more eggs in incubators.Chicken producers placed about 2.7% fewer chicks for meat production over the six weeks through Sept. 23 from a year earlier, when there was a 4.5% increase. Cumulative placements for 2023 dropped below last year around the end of May, U.S. data shows.""They cut back,"" said Bob Brown, an independent livestock market analyst. ""That seems to have buoyed the chicken market.""Story continuesAn index of chicken prices and feed prices that reflects profitability for poultry producers in September hit its highest level in more than a year, said Brown, who maintains the index. Declining feed costs help producers improve margins, and corn prices are near the lowest in three years.Chicken companies sought to constrain the weights of birds this summer as part of ""efforts to limit production and restore profitability,"" Rabobank said. Lighter birds produce less meat for consumers.In August, retail prices for whole fresh chickens and bone-in legs reached nominal records, the latest monthly U.S. Department of Agriculture data show. Drumstick prices climbed 10% from a nearly one-year low reached in February.Wholesale prices have also rebounded.The U.S. government last month trimmed its estimate for 2023 chicken production from August due in part to expectations for lower chick placements. Production is still expected to surpass 2022.Producers moved to reduce placements after chicken supplies swelled last year.Tyson CEO Donnie King said in February that executives overestimated how strong consumer demand would be for chicken in late 2022, leaving the company to resell excess inventories at a discount.""That was a failure on their part,"" said Arun Sundaram, senior equity analyst at CFRA Research.GROWING DEMAND FOR CHICKENChickens raised for meat largely avoided bird-flu infections in 2022, keeping supplies ample as the worst-ever U.S. outbreak devastated flocks of egg-laying hens and triggered export restrictions on poultry.Improving U.S. demand is now helping reduce excess supplies, Sundaram said. He forecasts Tyson's chicken business will report positive margins of 1.5% in the quarter ended Sept. 30 before jumping to 4% in fiscal year 2024. Quarterly results are expected in November.""We've seen some recovery in chicken prices and we've seen some consumer prices start to level off,"" Tyson CFO John R. Tyson told investors last month. ""We probably would have expected that to take place sooner.""Companies still have large supplies in freezers. U.S. inventories of frozen chicken breasts were a record high for August. Tyson also said this week that layoffs will expand to the second shift at a chicken facility in Wilkesboro, North Carolina, ""in response to customer demand,"" signaling ongoing hurdles.Further increases in chicken prices could threaten demand, said Adam Speck, senior commodity analyst for Gro Intelligence.But consumers are still choosing chicken due to tighter beef supplies, after ranchers reduced their herds during three years of drought in the Great Plains.""We should see improving demand for chicken going forward,"" said Bill Densmore, senior director for Fitch Ratings. ""We'll see retail beef prices remain high.""(Reporting by Tom Polansek; Editing by Caroline Stauffer and David Gregorio)]"

You can skip this part and go to 5 largest food importing countries in the world.In today's interconnected world, food imports have become critical to food security and economic prosperity. In 2022, food import costs globally reached nearly $2 trillion. In 2023, the global food bill will rise to $1.98 trillion, 1.5% higher than in 2022. Several factors, including population growth, urbanization, and rising incomes, drive this growth.The quest for sustenance, driven by evolving consumption patterns, and geopolitical events, has rendered the import of foodstuffs an essential consideration for countries across the globe. The world's challenges and opportunities constantly change the food import market. These challenges and opportunities include climate change, supply chain disruptions, technological advancements, and shifting trade agreements.Germany is one of the largest food importing countries in the world, as its high population and limited agricultural production make it reliant on imports to meet its food needs. In 2021, Germany imported food products valued at $77.5 billion. Most of these products, about 72%, came from fellow EU member states. Among the food items imported to Germany, meat, vegetables, and oils are the top commodities.Correspondingly, China's remarkable growth in income and living standards, increasing urbanization, and concerns about food safety have led to a significant surge in agricultural imports over the past two decades. By 2022, China's food imports had risen to 8.5 percent of total merchandise imports. This marks a substantial increase from the 3.9 percent seen in 2003, showcasing an average annual growth rate of 4.75 percent.

Synchrony's Lifetime of Dental Care Costs study interviewed more than 1,000 insured and uninsured Americans between the ages of 20 and 79 about annual out-of-pocket dental costs and the financial, emotional, and psychological effects surrounding those costs.To read the Synchrony Lifetime of Dental Care Costs research or to find content about solutions to pay for dental care with or without insurance, and opportunities to ask questions of care experts, please visit www.dentallifetimeofcare.com.""Dental health is essential to overall health, and rising out of pocket costs are preventing patients from accessing the care they want and need,"" said Bete Johnson, Senior Vice President and General Manager, Dental, Synchrony. ""We conducted this research to get a clear picture of what patients can expect in dental care costs during a lifetime – to help them plan ahead, and connect them with the tools and resources to manage these costs.""The report found that more than half (58%) of consumers expressed that dental care is not affordable, and for those living without dental insurance, that number rose to 75%. Results depicted that dental care for the average adult, aged 20-79 can cost $51,000 for single coverage and up to $95,000+ for couple and family coverage during a lifetime— and is only the tip of the iceberg. Additional care, like dental implants, orthodontia or more complex needs, could costs tens of thousands of dollars per procedure.Cost as a Barrier to Dental CareAs a result of these costs, 9 out of 10 respondents (92%) said they would consider holding off on general dental care because of cost, with 4 out of 5 (83%) saying the same for emergency dental care. Fifty-four percent of the surveyed consumers cited costs as the primary reason they did not visit the dentist in the last year. Among consumers, people with dental insurance (78%) were more likely to visit the dentist than those without insurance (55%).Story continuesData also showed the ability to afford dental care worsens as Americans age. When asked if dental care was affordable, 51% and 52% of Generation Z and Millennials said ""no,"" and that number increased for older generations— 61% of both Generation X and Baby Boomers as well as 67% of Silent Generation respondents reported dental care as not being affordable.Are Consumers Prepared for Unexpected Dental Costs?People are more likely to experience a dental emergency than they realize, with half of the survey respondents reporting at least one dental emergency in their lifetime and 13% reporting one in the last year. Despite this, just 26% of respondents said they actively save for dental expenses. Among those that do, on average, only $648 is saved—nearly two-thirds use a savings account and a quarter have a Health Savings Account (HSA) or FSA. More than half of all respondents (52%) said they would hold off general dental care if the out-of-pocket cost was up to $1,000.The Impact of Delayed Dental CareNearly half of respondents who delayed care reported that delaying their recommended procedure caused additional dental issues. Poor dental health can lead to additional problems, as supported by a growing body of evidence that shows the connection between oral health and overall health.""People should be able to access their routine dental care when they need and want it, just as they should with other aspects of their wellness,"" added Johnson.With patients shouldering more financial responsibility for their dental care because of higher out-of-pocket costs, rising costs can result in people choosing between their financial and their physical health.""The research findings are important because the reality is that patients are far more likely to delay dental care because of the associated costs,"" said Dr. Brian Harris, DDS. ""I believe it's important to have full transparency with patients about the cost of their care so they can know their options before they sit in my chair. I think the findings of this study highlight just how important that step is to ensuring people can plan, pay for and ultimately receive the care they need.""The Importance of Financial SupportIncreasingly, dentists are looking to external support to maintain financial operations while ensuring patients are getting the experience they want and financial support they need. Synchrony, a leader in consumer lending for more than 90 years, has also been a leading financial solutions provider in the dental space with its CareCredit credit card for more than 35 years.CareCredit is accepted in 80% of dental practices across the country and is a convenient and reliable solution that offers financing options for qualified consumers.

And while active stock picking involves risks (and requires diversification) it can also provide excess returns. For example, the QUALCOMM Incorporated (NASDAQ:QCOM) share price is up 57% in the last 5 years, clearly besting the market return of around 41% (ignoring dividends).So let's investigate and see if the longer term performance of the company has been in line with the underlying business' progress. View our latest analysis for QUALCOMM While markets are a powerful pricing mechanism, share prices reflect investor sentiment, not just underlying business performance. One flawed but reasonable way to assess how sentiment around a company has changed is to compare the earnings per share (EPS) with the share price.During the last half decade, QUALCOMM became profitable. That would generally be considered a positive, so we'd expect the share price to be up. Since the company was unprofitable five years ago, but not three years ago, it's worth taking a look at the returns in the last three years, too. In fact, the QUALCOMM stock price is 7.8% lower in the last three years. In the same period, EPS is up 48% per year. It would appear there's a real mismatch between the increasing EPS and the share price, which has declined -2.7% a year for three years.You can see how EPS has changed over time in the image below (click on the chart to see the exact values).earnings-per-share-growthWe're pleased to report that the CEO is remunerated more modestly than most CEOs at similarly capitalized companies. But while CEO remuneration is always worth checking, the really important question is whether the company can grow earnings going forward. Dive deeper into the earnings by checking this interactive graph of QUALCOMM's earnings, revenue and cash flow.What About Dividends?When looking at investment returns, it is important to consider the difference between total shareholder return (TSR) and share price return. Whereas the share price return only reflects the change in the share price, the TSR includes the value of dividends (assuming they were reinvested) and the benefit of any discounted capital raising or spin-off. Arguably, the TSR gives a more comprehensive picture of the return generated by a stock. We note that for QUALCOMM the TSR over the last 5 years was 79%, which is better than the share price return mentioned above. And there's no prize for guessing that the dividend payments largely explain the divergence!Story continuesA Different PerspectiveInvestors in QUALCOMM had a tough year, with a total loss of 7.5% (including dividends), against a market gain of about 11%. Even the share prices of good stocks drop sometimes, but we want to see improvements in the fundamental metrics of a business, before getting too interested. Longer term investors wouldn't be so upset, since they would have made 12%, each year, over five years. If the fundamental data continues to indicate long term sustainable growth, the current sell-off could be an opportunity worth considering. While it is well worth considering the different impacts that market conditions can have on the share price, there are other factors that are even more important.

For a quick overview of the 10 most visited cities in the world, read our article 10 Most Visited Cities in the World in 2023.The global tourism industry, which accounted for an estimated 10% of global GDP pre-pandemic, has shown a significant rebound in the first half of 2023, with international arrivals in the APAC region reaching 80% of pre-pandemic levels. This is partly due to a progressive reopening of international borders in 2022, which resulted in over 960 million tourists traveling internationally last year, recovering two-thirds (66%) of pre-pandemic levels. The first three months of 2023 saw an estimated 235 million international tourist arrivals, more than double the same period in 2022.The Middle East led the global tourism in 2023, with arrivals at 83% of pre-pandemic levels. Europe also rebounded strongly, welcoming 585 million visitors, or nearly 80% of its 2019 numbers. Africa and the Americas recovered about 65% of their pre-pandemic tourist arrivals, while Asia and the Pacific lagged at 23% due to strict pandemic-related restrictions.Global Travel Trends in 2023Adventure-seekers are turning to captivating TV locales for their next-big-trip inspiration. According to Expedia (NYSE:EXPE) Travel Trends Report 2023, two-thirds of global travelers have considered, and 39% have booked, destinations after seeing them on streamed shows or movies. Expedia (NYSE:EXPE) stated that this is just 2% less than advice from friends and family, the most influential source of travel inspiration. Travelers today seek spontaneous and affordable three-star hotel stays, moving away from the traditional grand expeditions. Despite having fewer stars, these hotels maintain high standards, offering excellent amenities, stylish interiors, and unique experiences, all at budget-friendly rates. They are particularly suited for last-minute or flexible travel plans. Conforming to Expedia (NYSE:EXPE) in 2023, vacation rentals now place great importance on their kitchens. The top five desired cooking amenities include outdoor kitchens or barbeques (50%), pizza ovens (25%), premium coffee machines (37%), air fryers (30%), and access to gardens with fresh produce (24%).Story continuesBooking Holdings Inc.

Booking Holdings Inc.’s (NASDAQ:BKNG) Travel Predictions revealed that in 2023, nearly nine in ten travelers would be interested in a nostalgic getaway, with 23% wanting to escape to simpler times. Theme parks are a top choice for thoughtful travelers, with 61% planning to visit one in 2023. This is likely because theme parks offer a fun and carefree experience that can transport visitors back to their childhood.Furthermore, Booking Holdings Inc. (NASDAQ:BKNG) reported that multi-generational family reunions are also expected to be popular in 2023, with 54% of travelers planning to take one.

The company also raised its profit outlook for the third quarter, citing positive demand trends and a favorable fuel price forecast.Tourism Trends in China in 2023China's tourism sector was poised for a strong comeback in 2023 despite the significant impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic. Domestic tourism revenue is projected to exceed RMB 4 trillion (approximately US$580.96 billion), a 96% increase from 2022. Both outbound and inbound tourism markets have shown impressive vitality in the first half of 2023, surpassing 2019 levels. Average expenditures for outbound travelers have increased significantly, with Hong Kong and Macao leading the resurgence. The total number of inbound and outbound individuals has surged by 170%.According to Forbes, just a few years ago, the United States saw an influx of approximately 3 million Chinese tourists annually, making a significant contribution of over $30 billion to the US economy. Back in 2019, even though Chinese visitors represented just 4% of all foreign travelers coming to the US, they made up a striking 13% of the total spending. However, in the current year of 2023, the landscape has changed considerably, with projections indicating that the number of Chinese tourists visiting the US is expected to drop to fewer than 850,000. China lifts group travel restrictions to the US. Lifting travel restrictions is a positive development for the US tourism industry, which has been struggling to recover from the pandemic. If Chinese tourist arrivals can return to pre-pandemic levels, it would significantly boost the US economy.40 most visited cities in the world in 2023Kamira/Shutterstock.comMethodologyWe scoured the internet to find out the most popular travel destinations.

Of that amount, 73% stayed in a hotel and 67% took a domestic flight. Travel over the Memorial Day and Labor Day holidays reached record levels this year.Yet despite the rise in post-pandemic travel, not every company in the industry is benefitting. Many companies continue to struggle coming out of the Covid-19 crisis. High debt levels, labor unrest, and difficulty wooing customers back continues to plague the sector. This is in spite of Americans once again boarding airplanes and checking into resorts.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsInvestors beware. Dump these travel stocks before the damage is done.Airbnb (ABNB)meone holds the Airbnb logo in front of Dresden, Germany landscape. ABNB stock.Source: AlesiaKan / ShutterstockHomestay and rental company Airbnb (NASDAQ:ABNB) reported better-than-expected financial results for this year’s second quarter. The company announced earnings per share (EPS) of 98 cents compared to Wall Street’s expectation of 78 cents.Revenue in Q2 totaled $2.48 billion versus $2.42 billion that was forecast by analysts who track the company’s progress. However, while the headline numbers were good, Airbnb also shared a dismal report. The number of nights and experiences booked on its platform weakened during the period.Specifically, Airbnb revealed that it had 115.1 million nights and experiences booked on its platform during Q2, up nearly 11% from a year earlier. But this is less than the 117.6 million forecast by analysts.Additionally, gross booking value per night came in at $166.01 during Q2, up only 1% from a year ago. The result was that ABNB stock fell 6% immediately after the Q2 print went public. Analysts say the bookings slowdown is a major red flag for the company moving forward and could portend bigger problems at Airbnb.Although ABNB stock is up 21% over the last 12 months, it’s trading 4% below its IPO in December 2020.Story continuesUnited Airlines (UAL)The front view of a passenger airplane with a sunset in the background. Airline stocksSource: ShutterstockUnited Airlines (NASDAQ:UAL) received a fair amount of praise for reaching a new labor agreement with its 16,000 pilots this past July. However, the collective agreement signed with the Air Line Pilots Association came at a steep price – literally.The pilots’ union managed to secure a 40.2% pay increase over four years as part of a new deal with United. By some estimates, the pay increase will cost UAL as much as $10 billion over the life of the new contract. This fact left many analysts shaking their heads in disbelief.The agreement reached by United’s pilots is inspiring to other unions. The United Auto Workers (UAW) is demanding 40% pay raises from the Detroit automakers. Yet, the deal could put the airline carrier in financial straits just as it was emerging from the ravages of Covid-19.United exited the pandemic with $30 billion of debt. It’s managed to pare that down to $26.85 billion but still has a heavy load to carry. The deal with the pilots, which also includes improvements to overtime pay and holiday pay, could strain the company‘s finances further.UAL stock is up 23% over the last 12 months but is currently trading 53% lower than five years ago.Expedia (EXPE)Expedia app logo on a smartphone screenSource: NYC Russ / Shutterstock.comShares of Expedia (NASDAQ:EXPE) fell 15% after the company’s second quarter financial results were released. The plunge was due to the company coming up short on its bookings and revenue.The online travel company managed to report record revenue of $3.36 billion in Q2. But that figure still fell short. Wall Street’s lofty forecasts expected the company to fully capitalize on the post-pandemic travel boom. Also, gross bookings were disappointing, rising 9% year over year (YOY) to $27.3 billion, below analysts’ call for $28.3 billion.Expedia reported earnings per share (EPS) of $2.89, up 48% from a year ago and ahead of analyst estimates of $2.35. And, lodging bookings reached a record $19.2 billion. However, trouble signs emerged as Q2 lodging bookings came in lower than in this year’s first quarter.In addition, Q3 guidance came in below expectations, leading some analysts to predict a softening for Expedia. EXPE stock is up 5% over the last 12 months but is down nearly 25% from five years ago. Given the sharp rise in travel demand this year, the company should be performing better.On the date of publication, Joel Baglole did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.Joel Baglole has been a business journalist for 20 years.

In fact, Q3 earnings estimates in the aggregate were barely down since the start of the period, with estimates modestly up when negative revisions to the Energy or Finance sector estimates are excluded.For the 17 S&amp;P 500 companies that have already reported results in recent days for their fiscal quarters ending in August that we count as part of the Q3 tally, total earnings are up +0.6% on +4.02% higher revenues, with 82.4% beating EPS estimates and 70.6% beating revenue estimates.We have regularly been flagging the steady improvement in the revisions trend since April 2023, with the trend becoming more entrenched in recent months.

If you want to see more stocks in this selection, go directly to the 5 Best Bear Market Stocks To Buy Now.The US economy successfully avoided a recession owing to its resilient job market. However, it's worth noting that the job market is usually one of the last facets to weaken when interest rates rise. A recurring pattern has emerged in such economic cycles - out of the last nine instances of Federal Reserve rate hikes, seven resulted in an economic recession. The optimism among investors regarding AI's potential to enhance productivity and drive a new phase of growth played a significant role in the stock market's recovery from the severe drop experienced in 2022, particularly in the first half of this year. Despite the Federal Reserve's decision to raise interest rates as a measure to combat inflation, the S&amp;P 500 made an impressive leap of approximately 20%, briefly touching 4600 by the end of July. For Ed Yardeni, the founder of Yardeni Research, this surge was anticipated, albeit arriving ""ahead of schedule,"" indicating an imminent short-term decline.On October 1, Yardeni reflected on his earlier analysis, stating, ""We concluded that the index might fall to its 200-day moving average, which is currently around 4200."" True to that prediction, since that point, the S&amp;P 500 has indeed experienced a decline of about 7%, reaching around 4,280 by midday on October 2. Yardeni suggests that the index could very well decline further to meet their projected 4,200 mark sometime in October. However, beyond that, he foresees a rebound in the market. In recent months, several economists have revised their growth forecasts for the third-quarter GDP, citing the labor market's resilience and strong consumer spending. The economic forecasters on the panel at the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia revised their outlook in August, now anticipating real GDP growth of 1.9% at an annual rate for the third quarter. This represents a significant increase from their initial June forecast of just 0.6%.Story continuesMost Wall Street investors, however, remain unconvinced by the stock market's gains in 2023, fearing a potential further retreat due to looming recession risks. This sentiment was revealed in the recent CNBC Delivering Alpha investor survey, which gathered opinions from approximately 300 key figures in finance, including chief investment officers, equity strategists, portfolio managers, and CNBC contributors. The survey, aimed to gauge investor outlooks on the markets for the remainder of 2023 and beyond, revealed that over 60% of respondents view this year's stock market gain as merely a temporary bounce within a bear market, foreseeing more challenges on the horizon. On the contrary, 39% of investors believe that a new bull market has already begun.As the year progresses into its latter half, the stock market is already displaying signs of the anticipated recession effects, aligning with J.P. Morgan Research's predictions. It foresees a gradual economic downturn in the United States by late 2023 due to the cautious approach taken by the Federal Reserve, resulting in stricter credit conditions that will slowly exert downward pressure on economic growth. While numerous stocks are experiencing a downward trajectory, specific industries are thriving amidst this economic strain, making their respective stocks appealing investment prospects for global investors. Some notable sectors include Utilities, Healthcare, Consumer Staples, Communication Services, DIY, and related industries. These stocks generally possess a safeguarded profitability, less susceptible to economic cycle fluctuations and changes in consumer confidence.Given the situation, investors are actively seeking out top-performing stocks during a bear market to safeguard their investments. Notably, companies such as Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (NYSE:BRK-B), Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG), and Visa Inc. (NYSE:V) are drawing the interest of investors amid the prevailing bearish trend in the markets.Most Promising Tech Stocks According to AnalystsPhoto by Adam Nowakowski on UnsplashOur MethodologyOur list for the best bear market stocks to buy is grounded in hedge fund sentiment towards each stock.

CVS has been moving its portfolio to a more value-based outcome model, and Aetna was a major move in that direction. We were willing to accept the leverage that came with the deal because CVS has a very cash generative model, and we anticipated the free cash flow would enable the company to de-lever fairly quickly.By mid-2022, CVS was in a position to use the free cash flow that had been going to debt repayment to do bolt-on deals to further prepare for the value-based outcome model and/or return more cash to shareholders in the form of higher dividends or share repurchases. However, CVS lost a “star” in its largest Medicare plan in late 2022 and this will adversely impact earnings in 2024. This was a surprise and disappointment to us, but management should be able to regain the “star” in the back half of 2023, which will then give the company a nice tailwind in 2025…” (Click here to read the full text)12.

Therefore, you might want to consider some of the key factors that could influence the stock's performance in the near future.Over the past month, shares of this world's biggest maker of health care products have returned -3.3%, compared to the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's -6.2% change. During this period, the Zacks Large Cap Pharmaceuticals industry, which Johnson &amp; Johnson falls in, has lost 4.2%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?While media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.Earnings Estimate RevisionsRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.We essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.Johnson &amp; Johnson is expected to post earnings of $2.52 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -1.2%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -0.6%.The consensus earnings estimate of $10.03 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of -1.2%. This estimate has changed -0.1% over the last 30 days.Story continuesFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $10.89 indicates a change of +8.6% from what Johnson &amp; Johnson is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -0.5%.Having a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, Johnson &amp; Johnson is rated Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPSProjected Revenue GrowthWhile earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.For Johnson &amp; Johnson, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $21.61 billion indicates a year-over-year change of -9.2%. For the current and next fiscal years, $84.48 billion and $89.54 billion estimates indicate -11% and +6% changes, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryJohnson &amp; Johnson reported revenues of $25.53 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +6.3%. EPS of $2.80 for the same period compares with $2.59 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $24.68 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +3.43%. The EPS surprise was +7.28%.The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates three times over this period.ValuationWithout considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.Comparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.As part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.Johnson &amp; Johnson is graded C on this front, indicating that it is trading at par with its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.Bottom LineThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Johnson &amp; Johnson. However, its Zacks Rank #4 does suggest that it may underperform the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

At a pre-specified interim analysis review conducted by an independent Data Monitoring Committee, KEYTRUDA demonstrated a statistically significant and clinically meaningful improvement in DFS versus observation in these patients after surgery. The trial will continue to evaluate its other dual primary endpoint of overall survival (OS). The safety profile of KEYTRUDA in this trial was consistent with that observed in previously reported studies; no new safety signals were identified. Results will be presented at an upcoming medical meeting and discussed with regulatory authorities.""Up to half of patients with bladder cancer who undergo surgery will experience recurrence within a year, underscoring the need for new treatment options in the adjuvant setting,"" said Dr. Marjorie Green, senior vice president and head of late-stage oncology, global clinical development, Merck Research Laboratories. ""These positive results highlight the potential of KEYTRUDA to prevent recurrence after surgery for patients with localized muscle-invasive or locally advanced urothelial carcinoma.""This trial was sponsored by the U.S. National Cancer Institute (NCI), part of the National Institutes of Health. Alliance for Clinical Trials in Oncology designed and led the trial with funding from the NCI and participation from all the National Clinical Trials Network Groups. Merck provided funding and support through a Cooperative Research and Development Agreement between Merck and NCI.Story continuesMerck has an extensive clinical development program evaluating KEYTRUDA as monotherapy and in combination with other anti-cancer therapies across all stages of bladder cancer, including non-muscle-invasive, muscle-invasive and metastatic. Phase 3 studies in muscle-invasive bladder cancer include the KEYNOTE-866 trial, as well as the Phase 3 KEYNOTE-B15 and Phase 3 KEYNOTE-905 trials, which are being conducted in collaboration with Seagen and Astellas.About A031501 AMBASSADOR/KEYNOTE-123AMBASSADOR (A031501, KEYNOTE-123) is a randomized, open-label Phase 3 trial (ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT03244384) evaluating KEYTRUDA versus observation for the adjuvant treatment of patients with localized MIUC and locally advanced urothelial carcinoma. The dual primary endpoints are OS and DFS, and secondary endpoints include OS and DFS in PD-L1 positive and negative patients. The trial enrolled 702 patients who were randomized to receive KEYTRUDA (200 mg intravenously every three weeks for up to 18 cycles) or undergo observation.About bladder cancerIt is estimated that approximately 82,290 people in the U.S. will be diagnosed with bladder cancer in 2023, and approximately 7% of bladder cancer cases are locally advanced at diagnosis. Globally, there were approximately 573,000 new cases. Muscle-invasive bladder cancer is bladder cancer that has spread into the deep muscle of the bladder wall, and locally advanced urothelial cancer is cancer that begins in the urothelial cells and has spread from where it started to nearby tissue or lymph nodes. Despite surgery, up to 50% of patients with bladder cancer experience recurrence within 12 months.About Merck’s early-stage cancer clinical programFinding cancer at an earlier stage may give patients a greater chance of long-term survival. Many cancers are considered most treatable and potentially curable in their earliest stage of disease. Building on the strong understanding of the role of KEYTRUDA in later-stage cancers, Merck is studying KEYTRUDA in earlier disease states, with more than 25 ongoing registrational studies across multiple types of cancer.About KEYTRUDA® (pembrolizumab) injection, 100 mgKEYTRUDA is an anti-programmed death receptor-1 (PD-1) therapy that works by increasing the ability of the body’s immune system to help detect and fight tumor cells. KEYTRUDA is a humanized monoclonal antibody that blocks the interaction between PD-1 and its ligands, PD-L1 and PD-L2, thereby activating T lymphocytes which may affect both tumor cells and healthy cells.Merck has the industry’s largest immuno-oncology clinical research program. There are currently more than 1,600 trials studying KEYTRUDA across a wide variety of cancers and treatment settings. The KEYTRUDA clinical program seeks to understand the role of KEYTRUDA across cancers and the factors that may predict a patient's likelihood of benefitting from treatment with KEYTRUDA, including exploring several different biomarkers.Selected KEYTRUDA® (pembrolizumab) Indications in the U.S.Urothelial CarcinomaKEYTRUDA, in combination with enfortumab vedotin, is indicated for the treatment of patients with locally advanced or metastatic urothelial carcinoma (mUC) who are not eligible for cisplatin-containing chemotherapy.This indication is approved under accelerated approval based on tumor response rate and durability of response. Continued approval for this indication may be contingent upon verification and description of clinical benefit in the confirmatory trials.KEYTRUDA, as a single agent, is indicated for the treatment of patients with locally advanced or metastatic urothelial carcinoma (mUC):who are not eligible for any platinum-containing chemotherapy, orwho have disease progression during or following platinum-containing chemotherapy or within 12 months of neoadjuvant or adjuvant treatment with platinum-containing chemotherapy.KEYTRUDA, as a single agent, is indicated for the treatment of patients with Bacillus Calmette-Guerin-unresponsive, high-risk, non-muscle invasive bladder cancer (NMIBC) with carcinoma in situ with or without papillary tumors who are ineligible for or have elected not to undergo cystectomy.See additional selected indications for KEYTRUDA in the U.S. after the Selected Important Safety Information.Selected Important Safety Information for KEYTRUDASevere and Fatal Immune-Mediated Adverse ReactionsKEYTRUDA is a monoclonal antibody that belongs to a class of drugs that bind to either the PD-1 or the PD-L1, blocking the PD-1/PD-L1 pathway, thereby removing inhibition of the immune response, potentially breaking peripheral tolerance and inducing immune-mediated adverse reactions. Immune-mediated adverse reactions, which may be severe or fatal, can occur in any organ system or tissue, can affect more than one body system simultaneously, and can occur at any time after starting treatment or after discontinuation of treatment. Important immune-mediated adverse reactions listed here may not include all possible severe and fatal immune-mediated adverse reactions.Monitor patients closely for symptoms and signs that may be clinical manifestations of underlying immune-mediated adverse reactions. Early identification and management are essential to ensure safe use of anti–PD-1/PD-L1 treatments. Evaluate liver enzymes, creatinine, and thyroid function at baseline and periodically during treatment. For patients with TNBC treated with KEYTRUDA in the neoadjuvant setting, monitor blood cortisol at baseline, prior to surgery, and as clinically indicated. In cases of suspected immune-mediated adverse reactions, initiate appropriate workup to exclude alternative etiologies, including infection. Institute medical management promptly, including specialty consultation as appropriate.Withhold or permanently discontinue KEYTRUDA depending on severity of the immune-mediated adverse reaction. In general, if KEYTRUDA requires interruption or discontinuation, administer systemic corticosteroid therapy (1 to 2 mg/kg/day prednisone or equivalent) until improvement to Grade 1 or less. Upon improvement to Grade 1 or less, initiate corticosteroid taper and continue to taper over at least 1 month. Consider administration of other systemic immunosuppressants in patients whose adverse reactions are not controlled with corticosteroid therapy.Immune-Mediated PneumonitisKEYTRUDA can cause immune-mediated pneumonitis. The incidence is higher in patients who have received prior thoracic radiation. Immune-mediated pneumonitis occurred in 3.4% (94/2799) of patients receiving KEYTRUDA, including fatal (0.1%), Grade 4 (0.3%), Grade 3 (0.9%), and Grade 2 (1.3%) reactions. Systemic corticosteroids were required in 67% (63/94) of patients. Pneumonitis led to permanent discontinuation of KEYTRUDA in 1.3% (36) and withholding in 0.9% (26) of patients. All patients who were withheld reinitiated KEYTRUDA after symptom improvement; of these, 23% had recurrence. Pneumonitis resolved in 59% of the 94 patients.Pneumonitis occurred in 8% (31/389) of adult patients with cHL receiving KEYTRUDA as a single agent, including Grades 3-4 in 2.3% of patients. Patients received high-dose corticosteroids for a median duration of 10 days (range: 2 days to 53 months). Pneumonitis rates were similar in patients with and without prior thoracic radiation.

Merck said the study was limited and that it is confident in the clinical profile of the drug.Molnupiravir's global sales have dropped sharply since last year, when the company booked nearly $5.7 billion in revenue. This year, the company expects sales of the drug to be around $1 billion, and analysts forecast a further drop going forward.Since authorization, the U.S. government has delivered more than 3.2 million courses of molnupiravir of which more than 1.4 million have been administered, according to ASPR data. That compares with 15.4 million courses of Paxlovid delivered and nearly 10 million used.Story continuesThe U.S. still has additional Paxlovid inventory, which will continue to be available for free at pharmacies around the country until it too moves to the commercial market.Merck said it would have a patient assistance program for people who cannot afford the drug.(Reporting by Michael Erman Editing by Bill Berkrot)]"

But if you choose individual stocks with prowess, you can make superior returns. Just take a look at The Williams Companies, Inc. (NYSE:WMB), which is up 71%, over three years, soundly beating the market return of 17% (not including dividends). However, more recent returns haven't been as impressive as that, with the stock returning just 13% in the last year , including dividends .Now it's worth having a look at the company's fundamentals too, because that will help us determine if the long term shareholder return has matched the performance of the underlying business. See our latest analysis for Williams Companies To quote Buffett, 'Ships will sail around the world but the Flat Earth Society will flourish. There will continue to be wide discrepancies between price and value in the marketplace...' One imperfect but simple way to consider how the market perception of a company has shifted is to compare the change in the earnings per share (EPS) with the share price movement.During three years of share price growth, Williams Companies achieved compound earnings per share growth of 167% per year. This EPS growth is higher than the 19% average annual increase in the share price. So one could reasonably conclude that the market has cooled on the stock.The graphic below depicts how EPS has changed over time (unveil the exact values by clicking on the image).earnings-per-share-growthWe like that insiders have been buying shares in the last twelve months. Having said that, most people consider earnings and revenue growth trends to be a more meaningful guide to the business. Dive deeper into the earnings by checking this interactive graph of Williams Companies' earnings, revenue and cash flow.What About Dividends?When looking at investment returns, it is important to consider the difference between total shareholder return (TSR) and share price return. The TSR incorporates the value of any spin-offs or discounted capital raisings, along with any dividends, based on the assumption that the dividends are reinvested. It's fair to say that the TSR gives a more complete picture for stocks that pay a dividend. In the case of Williams Companies, it has a TSR of 103% for the last 3 years. That exceeds its share price return that we previously mentioned. This is largely a result of its dividend payments!Story continuesA Different PerspectiveWe're pleased to report that Williams Companies shareholders have received a total shareholder return of 13% over one year. And that does include the dividend. That's better than the annualised return of 10% over half a decade, implying that the company is doing better recently. In the best case scenario, this may hint at some real business momentum, implying that now could be a great time to delve deeper. I find it very interesting to look at share price over the long term as a proxy for business performance. But to truly gain insight, we need to consider other information, too. Like risks, for instance. Every company has them, and we've spotted   2 warning signs for Williams Companies   (of which 1 is concerning!) you should know about.Williams Companies is not the only stock that insiders are buying.

He added that travel demand cannot be met without bigger planes.The company aims to increase average seats per departure in North America by more than 40% in 2027 from 2019.United's latest order includes 50 Boeing 787-9 planes that it plans to operate on many routes currently being serviced by 767s. That version of 787 holds up to 129 more seats than the 767s in its fleet.Similarly, the 60 Airbus A321neos that United is buying can accommodate up to 30% more seats than some of Boeing's 757s that it has been flying.BIGGER IS BETTERUnited is not alone in this bigger-is-better approach.Data from industry body Airlines for America (A4A) shows larger planes holding more than 120 seats now account for about 68% of domestic U.S. scheduled flights compared with 58% before the pandemic.As a result, carriers are offering 14% more seats per flight in the current quarter compared with the fourth quarter of 2019, before the pandemic, according to data from A4A. That is despite a 9% reduction in scheduled flights.The shift towards larger planes comes at a time when airlines are grappling with a shortage of air traffic controllers in the United States, as many retired during the pandemic and training for new ones stopped.Story continuesJetBlue CEO Robin Hayes last month said it would take five years for staffing levels to catch up even if the Federal Aviation Administration doubled controller hiring. As a result, the airline expects to operate fewer flights in the short to medium term and has warned of a hit to its third-quarter revenue.Those challenges have compelled United to cut daily flights from Newark - its largest global gateway. Frontier Airlines also has been forced to rework its network because of the controller issues.An industry-wide pilot shortage, worsened by pandemic layoffs and retirements, has also accelerated the trend towards larger planes, said Addison Schonland, partner at consulting firm AirInsight.Flying bigger planes is more profitable for airlines even if that means fewer flight options for travelers. Carriers can sell more seats on each flight and operate with fewer planes and staff.United said its larger aircraft would drive up the average seats per departure, and translate into lower per-seat costs.Schonland said airlines can increase their seat capacity by 10% with just a 2%-3% increase in fuel burn. The newer generation planes are also far more fuel-efficient, which should reduce carbon emissions.Higher revenue potential and greater cost efficiency are reasons why American and Delta and United have all now embraced Airbus' A321 and are looking to retire Boeing's 757s, he said.""All the airlines are going in that direction,"" Schonland said.(Reporting by Rajesh Kumar Singh, editing by Ben Klayman and Rod Nickel)]"

The plane was grounded worldwide in March 2019 after two fatal 737 MAX crashes killed 346 people. The grounding order was lifted by the FAA in November 2020.Whitaker said he was committed to continuing reforms ordered by Congress after the crashes.""It was a failure all around, it was a failure at Boeing, it was a failure of the system to catch information that was not disclosed by Boeing,"" Whitaker said.

One such stock that demands attention is Illumina Inc (NASDAQ:ILMN). Currently priced at 138.32, the stock has experienced a daily gain of 3.29% and a 3-month decrease of 26.47%. According to its GF Value, the stock's fair valuation stands at $338.61.Understanding the GF ValueWarning! GuruFocus has detected 6 Warning Signs with ILMN. Click here to check it out. ILMN 30-Year Financial DataThe intrinsic value of ILMNThe GF Value is a unique measure that represents the current intrinsic value of a stock. It is derived from a proprietary method that takes into account historical multiples (PE Ratio, PS Ratio, PB Ratio, and Price-to-Free-Cash-Flow) at which the stock has traded, an adjustment factor based on the company's past returns and growth, and future estimates of business performance. The GF Value Line on our summary page provides a snapshot of the stock's fair value. If the stock price significantly deviates from the GF Value Line, it may indicate overvaluation or undervaluation, thus influencing future returns.Is Illumina (ILMN) Too Good to Be True? A Comprehensive Analysis of a Potential Value TrapUnveiling the RisksWhile the valuation may seem appealing, investors must conduct a thorough analysis before making an investment decision. There are certain risk factors associated with Illumina (NASDAQ:ILMN) that cannot be overlooked. These risks are primarily reflected through its low Piotroski F-score, Altman Z-score, and Beneish M-score. These indicators suggest that Illumina, despite its apparent undervaluation, might be a potential value trap. This complexity underscores the importance of comprehensive due diligence in investment decision-making.A Snapshot of Illumina Inc (NASDAQ:ILMN)Illumina provides tools and services to analyze genetic material with applications in life science and clinical labs. The company generates over 90% of its revenue from sequencing instruments, consumables, and services. Illumina's high-throughput technology enables whole genome sequencing in humans and other large organisms. Its lower throughput tools enable applications that require smaller data outputs, such as viral and cancer tumor screening. Illumina also sells microarrays (less than 10% of sales) that enable lower-cost, focused genetic screening with primarily consumer and agricultural applications.Story continuesIs Illumina (ILMN) Too Good to Be True?

We can see that institutions own the lion's share in the company with 64% ownership. That is, the group stands to benefit the most if the stock rises (or lose the most if there is a downturn).Given the vast amount of money and research capacities at their disposal, institutional ownership tends to carry a lot of weight, especially with individual investors. Therefore, a good portion of institutional money invested in the company is usually a huge vote of confidence on its future.Let's take a closer look to see what the different types of shareholders can tell us about Southern. See our latest analysis for Southern ownership-breakdownWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Southern?Institutions typically measure themselves against a benchmark when reporting to their own investors, so they often become more enthusiastic about a stock once it's included in a major index. We would expect most companies to have some institutions on the register, especially if they are growing.We can see that Southern does have institutional investors; and they hold a good portion of the company's stock. This can indicate that the company has a certain degree of credibility in the investment community. However, it is best to be wary of relying on the supposed validation that comes with institutional investors. They too, get it wrong sometimes. If multiple institutions change their view on a stock at the same time, you could see the share price drop fast. It's therefore worth looking at Southern's earnings history below. Of course, the future is what really matters.Story continuesearnings-and-revenue-growthInvestors should note that institutions actually own more than half the company, so they can collectively wield significant power. We note that hedge funds don't have a meaningful investment in Southern. The company's largest shareholder is The Vanguard Group, Inc., with ownership of 9.1%. In comparison, the second and third largest shareholders hold about 7.2% and 5.7% of the stock.On studying our ownership data, we found that 25 of the top shareholders collectively own less than 50% of the share register, implying that no single individual has a majority interest.While it makes sense to study institutional ownership data for a company, it also makes sense to study analyst sentiments to know which way the wind is blowing. Quite a few analysts cover the stock, so you could look into forecast growth quite easily.Insider Ownership Of SouthernWhile the precise definition of an insider can be subjective, almost everyone considers board members to be insiders. The company management answer to the board and the latter should represent the interests of shareholders. Notably, sometimes top-level managers are on the board themselves.Most consider insider ownership a positive because it can indicate the board is well aligned with other shareholders. However, on some occasions too much power is concentrated within this group.Our most recent data indicates that insiders own less than 1% of The Southern Company. It is a very large company, so it would be surprising to see insiders own a large proportion of the company. Though their holding amounts to less than 1%, we can see that board members collectively own US$164m worth of shares (at current prices). Arguably recent buying and selling is just as important to consider. You can  click here to see if insiders have been buying or selling. General Public OwnershipThe general public-- including retail investors -- own 36% stake in the company, and hence can't easily be ignored. This size of ownership, while considerable, may not be enough to change company policy if the decision is not in sync with other large shareholders.Next Steps:It's always worth thinking about the different groups who own shares in a company. But to understand Southern better, we need to consider many other factors. Like risks, for instance. Every company has them, and we've spotted   4 warning signs for Southern   (of which 2 are significant!) you should know about.If you would prefer discover what analysts are predicting in terms of future growth, do not miss this free report on analyst forecasts.NB: Figures in this article are calculated using data from the last twelve months, which refer to the 12-month period ending on the last date of the month the financial statement is dated.

The plans can be availed by customers during the Annual Enrollment Period, which will run between Oct 15, 2023, and Dec 7, 2023.

The contract has been awarded by the Naval Sea Systems Command, Washington, D.C.The majority of the work related to this contract will be executed in Groton, CT. The contract is expected to be completed by October 2024.Significance of Virginia-Class SubmarinesThe Virginia-class submarine is one of the most advanced nuclear-powered multisession stealth submarines suitable for marine warfare. The submarine excels in littoral and open-ocean environments and collects intelligence critical to the full spectrum of warfare. These are also capable of extended submerged operations with superior stealth, endurance, mobility and firepower.Such enhanced features have made the Virgin-class submarine a top choice for the U.S. Navy and resulted in a steady order inflow for the company from the Pentagon, like the latest one. Its strong demand can be gauged by General Dynamics’ current backlog strength.The company is currently working on Blocks IV and V in the program, with 17 Virginia-class submarines in its backlog scheduled for delivery through 2032. The Navy procures Virginia-class submarines in multi-boat blocks at a two-per-year rate.Such strong demand, in tandem with excellence in providing unique capabilities in submarines, should continue to boost the order book of General Dynamics in the long run, thus enhancing its revenue generation prospects.Growth Prospects &amp; Peer MovesEfficient submarines equipped with nuclear weapons add to military capabilities and deter potential nuclear attacks in sea warfare missions. The advancement in submarine technology and its difficult-to-detect feature further add to its diverse advantages. These have invariably sparked increased spending by nations on military submarines to maintain an edge in undersea warfare.Story continuesPer a report from the Mordor Intelligence firm, the submarine market is projected to witness a CAGR of 4% during the 2023-2028 period. This trend should favor General Dynamics’ Electric Boat segment growth as this unit is the prime contractor and lead shipyard on all Navy nuclear-powered submarine programs.Other defense majors poised to benefit from the expanding submarine market are BAE Systems BAESY, Northrop Grumman NOC and Huntington Ingalls Industries HII.BAE Systems’ Astute class submarines, the U.K.’s largest and most powerful attack submarines, can strike targets up to 621 miles from the coast with pinpoint accuracy.BAE Systems boasts a long-term earnings growth rate of 14%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate of BAESY’s 2023 sales calls for a growth rate of 33.6% from the prior-year reported figure.Northrop Grumman designs, develops and produces communication systems, sensors, signal processing and electronic warfare systems to counter increasingly sophisticated sea-based threats. It also provides launch systems for submarines. NOC’s eject launch technology has powered more than 7,000 successful launches.Northrop’s long-term earnings growth rate is pegged at 3.7%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate of NOC’s 2023 sales implies a growth rate of 5.8% from the prior-year reported figure.Huntington Ingalls is a co-developer with Electric Boat to build Virginia-class fast-attack nuclear submarines. Its Newport News division participates in the design and construction of the Columbia-class (SSBN 826) submarine as a replacement for the current aging Ohio-class nuclear ballistic missile submarines.The long-term earnings growth of Huntington is pegged at 6.6%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate of HII’s 2023 sales calls for a growth rate of 3.5% from the prior-year reported figure.Price PerformanceShares of General Dynamics have increased 2.7% in the past three months against the industry’s 12.5% decline.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchZacks RankGeneral Dynamics currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

The company also supplies technical and logistical support at sites where the missile is deployed.Due to its remarkable features, which are well-suited for any military mission, Lockheed continues to witness a steady inflow of orders involving the Trident missile. The latest contract win is a testament to that. This shall bolster LMT’s revenues from the Space Systems unit.Growth ProspectsOf late, nations have been increasing their spending on military equipment and weaponry to modernize and upgrade their defense systems amid rising geopolitical tensions. In this context, the demand for missiles is likely to gain momentum as these play a very important role in military missions.Per the latest report from the Mordor Intelligence firm, the global missile and missile defense systems market is expected to witness a CAGR of 4.8% over the 2023-2028 period. Such projections exemplify immense opportunities for Lockheed to capitalize on the expanding market.Story continuesNotably, the company’s Space business unit, apart from developing satellites and space transportation system, also builds strike missile as well as missile defense systems. Its major programs include Next Generation Interceptor — a program with the Missile Defense Agency — that utilizes next generation propulsion and sensors to provide homeland missile defense, apart from Trident II missile.Other prominent defense majors that are likely to enjoy the perks of the expanding missile defense market are Northrop Grumman NOC, General Dynamics GD and RTX Corp. RTX, which are involved in missile manufacturing or providing support services for the same.Northrop Grumman’s Missile Products business unit is a leading U.S. provider of solid rocket propulsion for national security and defense, providing stages for weapon systems, such as air-launched missiles, interceptors, submarine-launched systems and hypersonic missile systems.Northrop has a long-term earnings growth rate of 3.7%.

Don't Ignore These 2 Aerospace Stocks Set to Beat Earnings,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/want-better-returns-dont-ignore-130006249.html,1696424406,STORY,"['SPCE', 'NOC']","[Wall Street watches a company's quarterly report closely to understand as much as possible about its recent performance and what to expect going forward. Of course, one figure often stands out among the rest: earnings.The earnings figure itself is key, but a beat or miss on the bottom line can sometimes be just as, if not more, important. Therefore, investors should consider paying close attention to these earnings surprises, as a big beat can help a stock climb even higher.2 Stocks to Add to Your WatchlistThe Zacks Expected Surprise Prediction, or ESP, works by locking in on the most up-to-date analyst earnings revisions because they can be more accurate than estimates from weeks or even months before the actual release date. The thinking is pretty straightforward: analysts who provide earnings estimates closer to the report are likely to have more information. With this in mind, the Expected Surprise Prediction compares the Most Accurate Estimate (being the most recent) against the overall Zacks Consensus Estimate. The percentage difference provides the ESP figure.Now that we understand what the ESP is and how beneficial it can be, let's dive into a stock that currently fits the bill. Northrop Grumman (NOC) earns a Zacks Rank #2 right now and its Most Accurate Estimate sits at $5.82 a share, just 22 days from its upcoming earnings release on October 26, 2023.NOC has an Earnings ESP figure of 1.02%, which, as explained above, is calculated by taking the percentage difference between the $5.82 Most Accurate Estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $5.76.NOC is part of a big group of Aerospace stocks that boast a positive ESP, and investors may want to take a look at Virgin Galactic (SPCE) as well.Slated to report earnings on November 2, 2023, Virgin Galactic holds a #3 (Hold) ranking on the Zacks Rank, and it's Most Accurate Estimate is -$0.40 a share 29 days from its next quarterly update.For Virgin Galactic, the percentage difference between its Most Accurate Estimate and its Zacks Consensus Estimate of -$0.42 is 5.21%.Story continuesBecause both stocks hold a positive Earnings ESP, NOC and SPCE could potentially post earnings beats in their next reports.Find Stocks to Buy or Sell Before They're ReportedUse the Zacks Earnings ESP Filter to turn up stocks with the highest probability of positively, or negatively, surprising to buy or sell before they're reported for profitable earnings season trading.

And the truth is, you can make significant gains if you buy good quality businesses at the right price. For example, the ANSYS, Inc. (NASDAQ:ANSS) share price is up 87% in the last 5 years, clearly besting the market return of around 46% (ignoring dividends). On the other hand, the more recent gains haven't been so impressive, with shareholders gaining just 24%.Let's take a look at the underlying fundamentals over the longer term, and see if they've been consistent with shareholders returns. See our latest analysis for ANSYS There is no denying that markets are sometimes efficient, but prices do not always reflect underlying business performance. One imperfect but simple way to consider how the market perception of a company has shifted is to compare the change in the earnings per share (EPS) with the share price movement.Over half a decade, ANSYS managed to grow its earnings per share at 11% a year. This EPS growth is reasonably close to the 13% average annual increase in the share price. This indicates that investor sentiment towards the company has not changed a great deal. In fact, the share price seems to largely reflect the EPS growth.The company's earnings per share (over time) is depicted in the image below (click to see the exact numbers).earnings-per-share-growthWe know that ANSYS has improved its bottom line lately, but is it going to grow revenue? If you're interested, you could check this free report showing consensus revenue forecasts.A Different PerspectiveIt's good to see that ANSYS has rewarded shareholders with a total shareholder return of 24% in the last twelve months. Since the one-year TSR is better than the five-year TSR (the latter coming in at 13% per year), it would seem that the stock's performance has improved in recent times. Someone with an optimistic perspective could view the recent improvement in TSR as indicating that the business itself is getting better with time.

HOOD expects $100 million worth of charges related to regulatory issues to be incurred in the third quarter of 2023. The company will incur the costs to resolve the legal and regulatory matters that have been disclosed previously.HOOD has had various disagreements and confrontations with regulators in the past.The brokerage firm was in the limelight during the 2021 meme stock trading mania.Notably, in early 2021, in the midst of the pandemic, the U.S. stock market experienced the so-called meme-stock trading frenzy. A large number of retail investors on social media purchased shares of highly-shorted stocks such as GameStop and AMC Entertainment, which, over a short period, saw their stock prices surge to stratospheric levels.Thus, these companies were able to take advantage of the price surge, raising substantial amounts of capital at elevated prices, thereby improving their liquidity positions.However, at that time, Robinhood as a brokerage firm restricted customers’ ability to buy some of the meme stocks, causing their prices to suddenly drop. This created an outrage among those customers who could not take full advantage of the price surge.Thus, in a proposed class action, customers who owned stocks of AMC and GameStop claimed that they lost money because of Robinhood’s action.Nevertheless, this August, HOOD defeated the appeal by investors over its decision to restrict purchases of the meme stocks in the January 2021 frenzy.In a 3-0 decision, the U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Atlanta said that Robinhood’s standard customer agreement specifically authorized the restrictions and did not suggest that HOOD would accept all trade orders.Also, the court dismissed claims that Robinhood was negligent in failing to keep investors from losing money.However, in the same month, HOOD was defeated in its case against the Massachusetts Secretary of State, Bill Galvin. The Massachusetts Supreme Judiciary Court ruled that a state fiduciary duty rule, which says that broker-dealers have a fiduciary obligation to provide investment advice without regard to the interests of anyone but their customers, was considered valid.With its ruling, the Massachusetts court provided victory to state securities regulators in their enforcement action against Robinhood.In December 2020, the Secretary of State initiated an enforcement action against Robinhood, claiming that the online brokerage firm failed to protect its customers and their money.Galvin alleged that Robinhood treated trading as a game and implemented strategies to entice young and inexperienced traders to engage in risky trading through its online platform, violating the state’s fiduciary duty rule.Since then, Galvin sought to have Robinhood’s state broker-dealer license revoked.However, in March 2022, a trial court reached a decision in favor of Robinhood, saying that federal laws took precedence over the state regulator’s stipulations.Additionally, the judge who heard the case felt that Galvin overstepped his jurisdiction by implementing a regulation that was at odds with federal legislation.However, the Massachusetts’ top court’s ruling reversed the lower-court judge’s decision, thus providing victory to Galvin.Over the past six months, shares of Robinhood have lost 2.3% against the 2.6% rally of the industry.Story continues Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment Research Currently, HOOD carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Legal Hassles Faced by Other Finance FirmsA couple of months ago, a lawsuit accusing Wells Fargo WFC of defrauding its shareholders by making commitments to interview diverse job candidates in its hiring process, while it faked interviews for positions that had already been filled, was dismissed.U.S. District Judge Trina Thompson said that shareholders failed to prove the conduct of fake interviews. Moreover, no evidence was found that could prove that WFC’s chief executive, Charlie Scharf, and senior diversity executives had knowledge of the sham interviews.The plaintiffs, through the class action suit, had claimed that Wells Fargo had inflated its stock price by issuing a public statement discussing its guidelines mentioning workplace diversity. The said policy was adopted in 2020 and required at least 50% of candidates, who were interviewed for jobs paying at least $100,000, to be minorities, women or people from other disadvantaged groups.In another case, CURO Group Holdings Corp.’s CURO subsidiary, Heights Finance Holding Co., was sued by the U.S. Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (""CFPB"") for allegedly pushing low-income borrowers to refinance short-term loans. The practice placed nearly 10,000 borrowers in continuous debt between 2013 and 2020.The lawsuit, filed in federal court in Greenville, SC, stated that Heights Finance violated laws against unfair and abusive lending practices by churning loans through repeated refinancing.Per CFPB, Heights Finance took advantage of struggling borrowers by not offering them alternatives to refinancing, which carried a fee each time.However, CURO denied the allegations. In a statement, CURO mentioned that the small loans in consideration were originated by subsidiaries of Heights Finance before it was acquired by the company in late 2021 from private equity firm Milestone Partners.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

[And] they will all be available in pre-filled syringes,"" Bancel added.The pre-filled syringes will also apply to the RSV vaccine for older adults, for which Moderna is awaiting FDA approval.Boxes containing the Moderna COVID-19 vaccine are prepared to be shipped at the McKesson distribution center in Olive Branch, Miss., Sunday, Dec. 20, 2020. (AP Photo/Paul Sancya, Pool)""With the aging population, it's harder and harder to find technicians and pharmacists, so the pharmacy leadership [is] clear that they really like those easy-to-use product formulas. I think Moderna is going to be very well-positioned,"" Bancel said.Fridge-stable vaccines are popular for use globally for childhood immunization campaigns. But still, remote parts of the world, as well as areas that face extreme heat, need more. The industry has not been able to produce heat-stable vaccines — vaccines that would survive without refrigerators — despite pleas from public health advocates for more than a decade to do so.Still, the next generation of mRNA vaccines will prove more accessible, compared to the struggle to get doses in arms globally in the middle of the pandemic in areas where the infrastructure was not in place to receive the ultra-frozen shipments.Follow Anjalee on Twitter @AnjKhem.Click here for in-depth analysis of the latest health industry news and events impacting stock prices]"

Merck said the study was limited and that it is confident in the clinical profile of the drug.Molnupiravir's global sales have dropped sharply since last year, when the company booked nearly $5.7 billion in revenue. This year, the company expects sales of the drug to be around $1 billion, and analysts forecast a further drop going forward.Since authorization, the U.S. government has delivered more than 3.2 million courses of molnupiravir of which more than 1.4 million have been administered, according to ASPR data. That compares with 15.4 million courses of Paxlovid delivered and nearly 10 million used.Story continuesThe U.S. still has additional Paxlovid inventory, which will continue to be available for free at pharmacies around the country until it too moves to the commercial market.Merck said it would have a patient assistance program for people who cannot afford the drug.(Reporting by Michael Erman Editing by Bill Berkrot)]"

Though the updated mRNA-based COVID-19 vaccines marketed by Pfizer PFE/BioNTech BNTX and Moderna MRNA were granted approval by the FDA last month, the vaccine rollout has been slow. Unlike when the government handled the distribution and rollout, this is the first one through the commercial market (via retail pharmacies and physician offices). Several third-party reports have pointed out that this rollout has been hampered by logistical issues with distributors and insurance company platforms, thereby slowing the booster vaccines’ uptake.This will likely benefit Novavax, whose updated COVID vaccine will be available nationwide in the coming days. With Novavax currently struggling with cash flow needs, a surge for COVID-19 vaccines will help the company generate additional cash resources to fund its business operations. In an SEC filing in August, management stated that they have sufficient cash to fund business for the next twelve months.Novavax’s updated vaccine has also been included in the recommendations issued by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (“CDC”) last month.Shares of Novavax have lost 25.4% year to date compared with the industry’s 17.6% decline.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchStory continuesThe updated COVID vaccines are supposed to be free through private insurance, Medicare and Medicaid plans. For those who are uninsured or underinsured, the CDC will temporarily provide free shots through its Bridge Access Program.Novavax is one of the few companies which has an authorized vaccine for COVID-19 in the United States. However, the company faces stiff competition from Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna, which currently dominate the COVID vaccination space. These companies have also updated their COVID vaccines, demonstrating robust immune responses against the newer coronavirus variants.Last month, the FDA approved Moderna’s and Pfizer/BioNTech’s updated mRNA vaccines for use in individuals aged 12 years and older. However, both vaccines hold an edge over Novavax’s vaccine since they have been granted EUA for individuals aged six months through 11 years.The Moderna and Pfizer/BioNTech vaccines are also approved for use in Europe for use in individuals aged six months and older.

The managed services are delivered by IBM Consulting's global team of security analysts via IBM's advanced security services platform, which applies multiple layers of AI and contextual threat intelligence from the company's vast global security network – helping automate away the noise while quickly escalating critical threats.""Security teams today are not just outnumbered by attackers, but also by the number of vulnerabilities, alerts and security tools and systems they're tasked with managing on a day-to-day basis,"" said Chris McCurdy, General Manager, Worldwide IBM Consulting Cybersecurity Services. ""By combining advanced analytics and real-time threat intelligence with human expertise, IBM's new Threat Detection and Response Services can augment organization's security defenses with a capability that is scalable, continuously improving and strong enough for tomorrow's threats.""Intelligently Adapting Threat DefensesThe new TDR Services are underpinned by a set of AI-powered security technologies that support thousands of clients across the world, monitoring billions of potential security events per day. It leverages AI models that continuously learn from real-world client data, including security analyst responses, engineered to automatically close low priority and false positive alerts based on a client-defined confidence level. This capability also automatically escalates high risk alerts that require immediate action by security teams and provides investigation context.Story continuesIBM's TDR Services are designed to provide:Crowdsourced detection rules, Optimized alerts. Leveraging real-time insights from IBM's threat management engagements, the new services use AI to continuously assess and auto-recommend the most effective detection rules – helping to improve alert quality, and speed response times.

IBM Consulting Cybersecurity Services' vast global network serves more than 3,000 clients around the world – managing more than 2 million endpoints and 150 billion security events per day.""Security leaders today are trying to escape the vicious cycle of staff shortages, increased threats, and rising demands from the C-Suite to mature their cyber program without breaking the bank. For many organizations the old playbook of swapping out their tools for a vendor's preferred platform does not work, as they cannot afford to write off prior SOC investments,"" said Craig Robinson, IDC Research VP of Security Services. ""A service like IBM's Threat Detection and Response offering can provide an off-ramp to these concerns, without requiring a full rip-and-replace of their prior security investments and help shift their human capital in the SOC to more of a proactive mode.""To support continuous improvement for security operations capabilities, IBM's TDR Services, which are now available, include access to IBM's X- Force Incident Response Services along with the option to include additional proactive security services from IBM X-Force, such as penetration testing, adversary simulation or vulnerability management.

It is worth considering Marathon Petroleum (MPC), which belongs to the Zacks Oil and Gas - Refining and Marketing industry.This refiner has seen a nice streak of beating earnings estimates, especially when looking at the previous two reports. The average surprise for the last two quarters was 11.51%.For the most recent quarter, Marathon Petroleum was expected to post earnings of $4.55 per share, but it reported $5.32 per share instead, representing a surprise of 16.92%. For the previous quarter, the consensus estimate was $5.74 per share, while it actually produced $6.09 per share, a surprise of 6.10%.For Marathon Petroleum, estimates have been trending higher, thanks in part to this earnings surprise history. And when you look at the stock's positive Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction), it's a great indicator of a future earnings beat, especially when combined with its solid Zacks Rank.Our research shows that stocks with the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time. In other words, if you have 10 stocks with this combination, the number of stocks that beat the consensus estimate could be as high as seven.The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is related to change. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Marathon Petroleum currently has an Earnings ESP of +5.23%, which suggests that analysts have recently become bullish on the company's earnings prospects. This positive Earnings ESP when combined with the stock's Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) indicates that another beat is possibly around the corner. We expect the company's next earnings report to be released on October 31, 2023.Story continuesInvestors should note, however, that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss, but a negative value does reduce the predictive power of this metric.Many companies end up beating the consensus EPS estimate, but that may not be the sole basis for their stocks moving higher. On the other hand, some stocks may hold their ground even if they end up missing the consensus estimate.Because of this, it's really important to check a company's Earnings ESP ahead of its quarterly release to increase the odds of success.

But the reality is that when a company loses money each year, for long enough, its investors will usually take their share of those losses. Loss making companies can act like a sponge for capital - so investors should be cautious that they're not throwing good money after bad.In contrast to all that, many investors prefer to focus on companies like Marathon Petroleum (NYSE:MPC), which has not only revenues, but also profits. While profit isn't the sole metric that should be considered when investing, it's worth recognising businesses that can consistently produce it. Check out our latest analysis for Marathon Petroleum How Fast Is Marathon Petroleum Growing Its Earnings Per Share?In the last three years Marathon Petroleum's earnings per share took off; so much so that it's a bit disingenuous to use these figures to try and deduce long term estimates. Thus, it makes sense to focus on more recent growth rates, instead. Impressively, Marathon Petroleum's EPS catapulted from US$14.03 to US$31.68, over the last year. Year on year growth of 126% is certainly a sight to behold.One way to double-check a company's growth is to look at how its revenue, and earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) margins are changing. This approach makes Marathon Petroleum look pretty good, on balance; although revenue is flattish, EBIT margins improved from 8.0% to 11% in the last year. That's a real positive.In the chart below, you can see how the company has grown earnings and revenue, over time. Click on the chart to see the exact numbers.earnings-and-revenue-historyFortunately, we've got access to analyst forecasts of Marathon Petroleum's future profits. You can do your own forecasts without looking, or you can take a peek at what the professionals are predicting.Story continuesAre Marathon Petroleum Insiders Aligned With All Shareholders?Owing to the size of Marathon Petroleum, we wouldn't expect insiders to hold a significant proportion of the company. But we are reassured by the fact they have invested in the company. Holding US$95m worth of stock in the company is no laughing matter and insiders will be committed in delivering the best outcomes for shareholders. This should keep them focused on creating long term value for shareholders.Is Marathon Petroleum Worth Keeping An Eye On?Marathon Petroleum's earnings per share have been soaring, with growth rates sky high. This level of EPS growth does wonders for attracting investment, and the large insider investment in the company is just the cherry on top. At times fast EPS growth is a sign the business has reached an inflection point, so there's a potential opportunity to be had here. Based on the sum of its parts, we definitely think its worth watching Marathon Petroleum very closely. What about risks? Every company has them, and we've spotted   2 warning signs for Marathon Petroleum   (of which 1 is significant!) you should know about.There's always the possibility of doing well buying stocks that are not growing earnings and do not have insiders buying shares.

Nevertheless, we are always paying attention to the latest value, growth, and momentum trends to underscore strong picks.Considering these trends, value investing is clearly one of the most preferred ways to find strong stocks in any type of market. Value investors use tried-and-true metrics and fundamental analysis to find companies that they believe are undervalued at their current share price levels.In addition to the Zacks Rank, investors looking for stocks with specific traits can utilize our Style Scores system. Of course, value investors will be most interested in the system's ""Value"" category. Stocks with ""A"" grades for Value and high Zacks Ranks are among the best value stocks available at any given moment.One company value investors might notice is Molson Coors (TAP). TAP is currently sporting a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy), as well as a Value grade of A. The stock is trading with P/E ratio of 12.29 right now. For comparison, its industry sports an average P/E of 17.62. Over the last 12 months, TAP's Forward P/E has been as high as 15.57 and as low as 11.39, with a median of 12.77.TAP is also sporting a PEG ratio of 1.69.

TAP's PEG has been as high as 5.47 and as low as 1.67, with a median of 3.30, all within the past year.Value investors also frequently use the P/S ratio. This metric is found by dividing a stock's price with the company's revenue. This is a popular metric because sales are harder to manipulate on an income statement, so they are often considered a better performance indicator. TAP has a P/S ratio of 1.01. This compares to its industry's average P/S of 1.56.Story continuesValue investors will likely look at more than just these metrics, but the above data helps show that Molson Coors is likely undervalued currently.

The company has noted that the Revitalization Plan positioned it to deliver sustainable growth over the past few years. With the success of the Revitalization Plan, TAP is focused on accelerating growth in the years ahead through its new Acceleration Plan.Additionally, the company revealed its long-term financial outlook with expectations of amplified net revenue growth, margin expansion, attractive earnings per share growth and compelling free cash flow generation, which are likely to support reinvestment in value creation.Investors were positive about the company’s announcement of the Acceleration Plan and the resulting long-term financial outlook. Consequently, shares of Molson Coors rose 1.6% in the after-hours trading session on Oct 3, 2023.Moreover, the company’s focus on core competencies has been well-reflected in its share price, with the stock outperforming the industry and the market. Shares of this Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) company have rallied 27.9% in the past year against the industry’s decline of 3%. The stock also fared better than the sector’s fall of 2.7% and the S&amp;P 500’s growth of 13.7% in the same period. Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment Research Key Features of the Acceleration PlanMolson Coors' new growth plan focuses on five key pillars to transform the company and drive sustained success in the global beverage market. These five key pillars focus on growing core brands, aggressively premiumizing its portfolio, expanding in Beyond Beer, building capabilities and efficiencies, and commitment to core values. The company aims to double down on its core strengths while diversifying into new and emerging categories.Firstly, the company is keen on growing revenues of its core power brands. In the United States, its core brands, such as Coors Light, Miller Lite and Coors Banquet, have been witnessing sustained growth in the past several years, positioning them perfectly to capitalize on shifting consumer preferences, particularly in the premium segment in 2023. Similar gains have been observed in other key global markets, such as Molson in Canada and Ozujsko in Croatia, while Carling remains a top brand in the U.K. The company expects to maintain the momentum of these brands.Secondly, Molson Coors is committed to aggressively premiumizing its portfolio, both in the Beer and Beyond Beer categories. Major successes like Madri in the U.K. and Simply Spiked in North America have bolstered net sales from the above-premium portfolio, increasing from 23% in 2019 to an impressive 28% in 2022. The company aims to expand the above-premium segment to approximately one-third of net sales in the medium term. This growth is expected to be driven by building on the current strength of the above-premium portfolio, along with compelling innovations, particularly in Beyond Beer.In its third pillar, the company is focused on scaling and expanding in the Beyond Beer segment, which includes Flavor, Spirits and Non-Alcoholic products. These offerings support the premiumization strategy and emphasize scalable products in high-growth segments. From diverse flavors to acclaimed whiskey brands and energy drinks in partnership with Dwayne Johnson’s ZOA Energy, the Beyond Beer portfolio is poised to drive a substantial portion of the above-premium net sales growth target over the medium term.Furthermore, Molson Coors plans to continue investing in building leading capabilities and efficiencies, including digital transformation, marketing effectiveness, sales execution and sustainability initiatives. These investments, which have already borne fruit since 2019, are expected to drive further growth and margin expansion through productivity improvements, operating efficiencies and cost savings.Lastly, the company reaffirms its commitment to core values, notably putting people first. The contributions of more than 16,000 employees worldwide are acknowledged, along with the foundational principles of the Revitalization Plan. This holistic approach reflects Molson Coors' dedication not only to business growth but also to its employees, communities and the planet.Story continuesLong-Term Financial TargetsMolson Coors provided a comprehensive long-term financial outlook, showcasing its confidence in executing the ambitious growth plan.Over the long term, Molson Coors expects to achieve low-single-digit annual net sales growth on a constant-currency basis. Moreover, the company’s targets indicate its commitment to enhancing its profitability. It expects to deliver mid-single-digit annual underlying income before income tax growth on a constant-currency basis. Additionally, it estimates annual underlying earnings per share growth in the high-single digits for the long term.Molson Coors also expects to maintain a net-debt-to-underlying-EBITDA ratio of under 2.5X over the long term. This reflects a commitment to prudent financial management, including disciplined capital allocation and effective debt management.With provisions for improved financial flexibility, the company also prioritized its capital allocation plan focused on investments in its business, net debt reduction and returning cash to shareholders. As part of the capital allocation plan, the company authorized a new $2-billion share repurchase program, extending for a five-year term.ConclusionBy setting clear objectives across key financial metrics, the company demonstrates its commitment to delivering sustainable growth, enhancing profitability and maximizing shareholder value. With a clear vision and the accelerated growth plan, Molson Coors is poised to navigate the evolving beverage industry landscape and capitalize on emerging opportunities in the global market.Other Key PicksWe have highlighted three other top-ranked stocks from the Consumer Staples sector, namely Constellation Brands STZ, Coca-Cola KO and Compania Cervecerias Unidas CCU.Constellation Brands has a trailing four-quarter earnings surprise of 4.4%, on average.

A good example is its Health Indicator feature. This comprehensive indicator provides an overall rating of a stock’s current health.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsUsing this metric, you can quickly find potential opportunities to explore. Broken down into three “zones” (green, yellow, and red), you’ll have a general idea about whether it’s best to be bullish, bearish, or neutral on a particular stock.As you may have guessed, stocks in the “Green Zone” are performing well, with little indication that the trend is on the verge of shifting.A stock in the “Yellow Zone” has corrected by more than 50% of its volatility quotient (or VQ), a proprietary TradeSmith metric that helps measure a stock’s risk. When a stock in your portfolio goes from green to yellow, it may be a good time to reassess whether to maintain the position.Stocks entering the “Red Zone” have corrected by more than their calculated volatility quotient. VQ can be useful when adding stop losses to positions. View any move into the Red Zone as a warning sign to exit your position for now.These three cannabis stocks to watch are currently in the “Green Zone.”Molson Coors (TAP)Molson Coors (TAP) logo on a web browser magnified by a magnifying glassSource: OleksandrShnuryk / Shutterstock.comIn the “Green Zone” for over eight months, Molson Coors (NYSE:TAP) is, as you may know, mainly a brewing company. In fact, it is the world’s third largest brewer. Besides its namesake Molson and Coors brands, other brands in TAP’s portfolio include Miller and Blue Moon.Molson Coors’ involvement with THC-infused beverages technically makes TAP stock a cannabis play as well. However, this is arguably changing. Last month, the company announced that it was selling its 57.5% interest in infused-beverage startup Truss to its partner in the venture, Tilray (NASDAQ:TLRY).Story continuesThis divestiture suggests Molson Coors is getting out of the cannabis business and not looking back, but that’s not for certain. If additional federal legalization progress is made, the company could decide to once again pursue opportunities in this fast-growing sector. TradeSmith’s volatility quotient for TAP is 21.83%, which makes it a medium-risk stock.Green Thumb Industries (GTBIF)marijuana stocks Hand gently holding rich soil for his marijuana plantsSource: Jetacom Autofocus / Shutterstock.comGreen Thumb Industries (OTCMKTS:GTBIF) shares have been in the “Green Zone” for the past seven days. GTBIF experienced a strong rally in late August and early September. This was due to developments that may bode well for the eventual federal legalization of marijuana.However, that’s not the only bit of positive news lately for this Chicago-based purveyor of cannabis products. The company also announced earlier this month plans to repurchase up to 5% of the outstanding subordinate voting shares of GTBIF stock. An established operator with a presence in several U.S. states, Green Thumb generates over $1 billion in annual revenue.Green Thumb is also expected to report steady earnings growth in 2024 and 2025. Poised to capitalize on federal legalization if and when it happens, consider this one of the cannabis stocks to watch. TradeSmith’s volatility quotient for GTBIF is 48.75%, which makes it a high-risk stock.Trulieve Cannabis (TCNNF)Florida licensed medical marijuana cannabis provider TrulieveSource: Leigh Trail / Shutterstock.comLike GTBIF, Trulieve Cannabis (OTCMKTS:TCNNF) has also recently entered the “Green Zone,” holding that status for over one week. Shares in this cannabis company have also been boosted by the recent positive legalization news.Based in Quincy, Florida, Trulieve cultivates, produces, and is a retailer of medicinal and recreational cannabis products in eight U.S. states. In terms of fundamentals with TCNNF stock, while profitable on an EBITDA basis, the company has yet to reach GAAP profitability.Still, one of the latest proposed marijuana law reforms may enable state-level cannabis companies like this one to narrow net losses, and get on track toward reporting positive net earnings. Trulieve has also recently made progress de-levering its balance sheet, buying back $47.6 million worth of debt at a discount to par value. TradeSmith’s volatility quotient for TCNNF is 46.74%, which makes it a high-risk stock.The TradeSmith Research Staff member primarily responsible for this article did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.TradeSmith’s mission is to put easy-to-use, technology-based tools into the hands of individual, self-directed investors.

Despite Ford's business seeing a boost, what kind of damage can a prolonged UAW strike have on the major automaker?Morningstar U.S. Autos Equity Analyst David Whiston details where Ford could feel the most pain from expanding picket lines.""They do have some of the most exposure because they have the highest UAW head count, they also have the highest of the North American production mix, they have the most in the United States at over 80%,"" Whiston points out. ""But it really just depends on what does the ultimate deal look like.""For more expert insight and the latest market action, click here to watch this full episode of Yahoo Finance Live.Video TranscriptJULIE HYMAN: Ford really seems to be the one that is getting a lot of negative chatter here. Excuse me. And it's third quarter sales rose in the single digits though by 7.7%. We saw double digits for some of the others. Is Ford sort of the big loser in this whole union negotiation situation?DAVID WHITSON: I think that's a little extreme to say that. They do have some of the most exposure because they have the highest UAW head count. They also have the highest-- of their North American production mix, they have the most in the United States at over 80%. But it really just depends what does the ultimate deal look like?You know, things like wage increases get a lot of attention. But they're by far not the only thing that matters here. And honestly, I could live with-- as an analyst, I can live with even north of 20% wage increases. It's things like reopening the pension, reopening retiree health care, the jobs bank. Things like that, in my opinion, are just not affordable.JOSH LIPTON: The more this strike drags on though, David, where do you see the risk for production for Ford?DAVID WHITSON: Well, the production risk seems to be all tied to what does the UAW want to strike. They've been doing this for now mostly on assembly plants and then the parts distribution centers for GM and Stellantis, which I think is more to hurt-- unfortunately, hurt the dealers and try and get the dealers to put pressure on the automakers to get a deal. Ford hasn't had those centers hit yet.Story continuesThe union, though, in my opinion, they've actually-- I mean, what's happened is bad. I want to be clear. But they haven't done things to enact really deep flesh wounds yet because they haven't gone after full-size pickup trucks. They haven't gone after keep powertrain centers, parts centers, like GM's Romulus plant, for example.And they haven't gone after full-size SUVs either. So it'll be interesting if there's another announcement this Friday. Will they go after something more-- something that will hurt deeper? And Ford would have the most to lose there because they make all their pickup trucks in the United States, to be clear.JULIE HYMAN: Gotcha. So if that happens then, could we see another leg downwards for the stocks?DAVID WHITSON: Yeah. And I'm actually surprised how well the socks are holding up given the circumstances, not that they've been doing great either. But I've also noticed nobody is taking the lead and cutting their estimates yet. And I think, frankly, nobody wants to be first to do that.I think we're all as analysts probably just waiting for an update with Q3 earnings because assuming the strike does continue for a long time, the guidance given at Q2 earnings is almost certainly going to be off the table. It's just a matter of how bad does it get?]"

Tom Narayan, RBC Capital Markets Lead Equity Analyst for Global Autos, joins Yahoo Finance to break down the latest on the strikes and what they mean for the auto sector.Narayan explains that the severity of margins wouldn't be too harsh even if both sides reach a compromise: ""The bigger problem would be if price mix falls because of affordability.""

That, of course, could potentially impact production, vehicles available, which would then impact price. I guess, how material of a movement could we see if this lasts much longer than you and many forecasters have been expecting?TOM NARAYAN: Yeah, that's really the question that everybody's been asking. You know, a six-week period really would-- it would probably help the OEMs keep pricing elevated. It's probably bad for customers like us, right? But that only lasts for a few weeks, you know? So the pricing impact of a six-week work stoppage, it would keep things elevated for a limited period. If it's several months, yeah, now we-- now pricing stays elevated for perhaps an entire quarter. It keeps the pressure on volumes down.It's-- but I mean, look, these OEMs dealt with this, right? We had pandemic. We had semiconductor crisis. Shortages is nothing new. If anything, some OEMs probably like this, right, because it means they keep pricing elevated, and that's like really what's given them record profits. But yeah, the longer this lasts, it's just not good optics.Story continuesAlso, it creates an affordability problem for folks like us if we can't just afford to buy the car. It doesn't matter how much they'd love to price it, right? So the worst case scenario is if they're forced to drop pricing because retail buyers can't afford the car and you have production problems because of a longer strike. That's the perfect storm that could hurt them a lot because then you have both bad pricing and bad volumes. That would be the ultimate problem. But so far, we haven't seen evidence of that.BRAD SMITH: What do you need to hear from not just the automakers and what they're putting forward to make sure that they're actually going to be able to maintain margins that the Street has come to expect for years on a previous partnership or a previous deal that they had with the UAW? And how will that significantly shift your calculus going forward?TOM NARAYAN: Yeah, that's the other big question is, what happens to margins with these labor cost increases? It's interesting. I think there's been some agreement coming in on both sides. They're moving closer to each other, so that's why I don't really think it'll be months and months. But we've done some math on the margin impact. It's actually not as severe as a lot of people think it is. It's maybe 100 to 150 basis point of margin hit because of, let's say, a 30% wage increase, which we think would be the midpoint of where both sides are.But the bigger problem is if price mix falls because of affordability-- we're at record level pricing, right? Just try to buy a new car now. If that falls back to-- if it's back to 2019 levels, that's like 400 basis points. That's like four times what UAW wage increase would do, right? It probably won't be that severe. But if I look at my peer group, other folks like me and their estimates, we're not factoring in any of this.That's the scary part is estimates probably need to come down. Now, the buy side, the investor community, you could see where the stocks are. They're already pricing in, I think, like a 20% to 30% reduction in numbers. So you know, maybe the stocks are fairly valued from the [? bicep ?] perspective. But my peer group definitely needs-- needs to take their numbers down.]"

Also on Monday, Tesla EV rival, Rivian Automotive (NASDAQ: RIVN) topped quarterly delivery estimates as it more than doubled EV production. On Tuesday, General Motors (NYSE: GM), Toyota Motor Corporation (NYSE: TM) and Honda Motor Co Ltd (NYSE: LTD) also told a different story by posting stronger-than-expected US auto sales.Tesla Came Short Of Estimates But Remains On Track To Achieve Its Annual TargetsAnalysts expected Tesla to report a decline as the EV king paused production at some of its facilities in order to refit its assembly lines. Tesla delivered 435,000 vehicles worldwide in the third quarter, which is less than 466,000 EVs it delivered in the second quarter. But Tesla reaffirmed it is still on track to deliver 1.8 million vehicles this year, topping 2022’s deliveries of 1.3 million EVs.Rivian Beats Q3 Delivery Estimates As It Doubles ProductionAs supply chain challenges eased, Rivian is now on track to make 52,000 EVs this year. For the quarter ended on September 30th, the maker of R1T pickup trucks, R1S SUVs and EDV commercial vans delivered 15,564 vehicles, topping Visible Alpha’s estimate of 14,740 vehicles as deliveries rose 23% quarter-over-quarter and 136% YoY. As for production, Rivian made a new record as output rose 121% YoY as it made 16,304 battery electric vehicles (BEV) at its manufacturing facility in Normal, Illinois.General Motors Extended A Strong Year But The Impact Of The UAW Strike Is Yet To Be SeenGeneral Motors posted its U.S. sales rose 21% YoY to 674,336 vehicles. Sales were fueled by strong demand for pickups, crossover SUVs and EVs with EV sales rising 28% quarter-over-quarter. However, General Motors still did not address the impact of the ongoing strike and back in 2019, the 40-day walkout costed the Detroit automaker $3.6 billion and resulted in a 6% sales decline in the fourth quarter.Story continuesToyota And Honda Are Enjoying Great Momentum That Is Poised To Continue Throughout The YearWith a strong September that ended the quarter, Toyota sold 590,296 vehicles during the third quarter, which translates to a 12.2% rise. EV sales made almost a third of September sales that rose 13.9% compared to 2022’s September as Toyota sold 203,904 vehicles and expects the strong momentum to continue for the remaining months of 2023.During the third quarter, Honda sold 339,143 vehicles, with sales rising 52.7%. Honda might have been slow to enter the EV race, but it recently unveiled its new EV. With the 2024 Prologue, an all-electric sports SUV, Honda promises to challenge Tesla and its Model Y. With the help of GM with which it will work on two EVs, Honda might have a shot at catching up in the EV race.The UAW Strike Overshadowed Strong Q3 DeliveriesTesla’s dominance is being challenged away both in China and the U.S, but the EV king could profit from the unprecedented UAW strike as the costs and possible increase in workers’ wages can only widen Tesla’s cost advantage. As the UAW strike extents into its third week with analysts estimating costs to be nearing $4 billion, Ford Motor (NYSE: F) is due to report its third quarter U.S. sales later today while Stellantis (NYSE: STLA) posted a 1.3% YoY drop in sales as it sold 380,563 vehicles in the third quarter.DISCLAIMER: This content is for informational purposes only.

229,574ca242-9ab7-365a-ab92-3404bd20d387,GM,2023-10-05,Vehicles built on GM's Ultium EV platform finally showing up in sales data,Autoblog,https://finance.yahoo.com/m/574ca242-9ab7-365a-ab92-3404bd20d387/vehicles-built-on-gm%27s-ultium.html,1696433160,STORY,['GM'],"[General Motors has heralded its Ultium battery-electric platform as the future of its passenger car and truck lineup, but for the first two years of its existence, its impact on the marketplace has been virtually nonexistent. Well, that finally changed in the third quarter of 2023, and while the cars based on this architecture don't represent anywhere near the volume of GM's broader combustion portfolio, we're reaching a point where Ultium products are finally in view (and in the hands) of real-world shoppers.At this point, five U.S.-market Ultium models are in production: the GMC Hummer EV, Cadillac Lyriq, Chevrolet Blazer &amp; Silverado EV, and BrightDrop Zevo 600. If you're not familiar with that last one, that's OK; it's a commercial product that you likely won't see on the road for some time. Together, these four combined for 4,257 sales in the third quarter alone — up from 2,663 for the entire first half of the year. While that may not seem like a significant uptick when viewed from altitude, the quarter-to-quarter numbers paint a clearer picture.Let's toss out the stragglers first. The Chevy Blazer EV, and Silverado EV for example, are barely in production. GM delivered 19 Blazers and 18 Silverados in the third quarter and that's the entirety of their production runs so far. Likewise, GM's BrightDrop Zevo 600 delivery van effectively exists apart from the consumer marketplace, so its contribution of just 35 units can be set aside too. That leaves us the two you've heard of: the GMC Hummer EV and Cadillac Lyriq — models with high sticker prices and long reservation queues.Through the second quarter (remember, we're talking six months here), GMC sold 49 Hummer EVs. No typo. In the three months that made up the third quarter, GM moved 1,167 of them. Not only is that a dramatic improvement over the first half, but it's more Hummers than GMC sold in the entirety of 2022 (854). Lyriq's improvement was less eye-popping on paper, but after moving just 122 total units in 2022 and 2,013 of them in the first half of 2023, Cadillac managed to up that figure to 3,018 units in the third quarter alone.Story continuesGM is betting its short-term EV future on the Ultium platform, so these trends need to continue if that's going to be a profitable wager. The Blazer EV will be GM's first hope for real volume on this architecture and should be the company's next shot in the arm, but it remains to be seen whether the necessary materials and components can be pushed into the supply chain in time to give the new Buick Electra,  Silverado EV, Sierra EV and the next-generation Bolt breathing room.Related video:]"

Starbucks says the closure is ""standard course of business."" However, tit does follow similar moves made by companies such as Target (TGT) and Whole Foods (AMZN), which closed stores over rising safety concerns. Yahoo Finance's Brooke DiPalma explains the coffee chain's decision.For more expert insight and the latest market action, click here to watch this full episode of Yahoo Finance Live.Video TranscriptJULIE HYMAN: Starbucks is closing seven stores in San Francisco by the end of the month. It's the latest big chain to pull out of the Downtown area, following Target and Whole Foods, who cited rising homelessness and safety issues. Yahoo Finance's Brooke DiPalma is here with more.Brooke, you know, I keep trying to figure out, as we keep getting these headlines, how much of this is routine and how much of it is unusual? What can you tell us about Starbucks, in particular?BROOKE DIPALMA: Right. Good afternoon, Julie. Well, certainly, here Starbucks playing this as a simple real estate strategy. They're saying that it's a standard course of business, and they continue to evaluate the store portfolio. So those seven stores in San Francisco will close on October 22.And they said that employees were informed on Monday, and they'll be given the opportunity to transfer to another location on that date nearby. Now, as you can see here, these store locations are mainly in the Downtown San Francisco area that's gotten a lot of buzz recently, especially post-COVID.They include a Mission and Main, Battery street, and Market Street, among others. And it is worth noting that none of these locations are Union stores. So these are not stores that voted to unionize. But in a letter from Northern California Regional Vice President to employees, she said that there are several factors Starbucks considers when tasked with the tough decision of closing a store, but it's all part of ensuring a healthy store portfolio.Story continuesNow, despite these closures, Starbucks will still have a presence in San Francisco. They now have 59 stores in San Francisco. And following these closures on October 22, there will be 52 remaining. But when Starbucks asked if this was a decision made due to a threat of safety of both employees and customers, well, Starbucks spokesperson declined to comment on that front.But as you noted, Julie, this is a big story here, considering the fact that just last week, Target closed three stores in the San Francisco and Oakland area due to a threat of retail crime and organized retail crime, that is. Also, in addition to that, we saw earlier this year, Whole Foods market closed on Market Street in San Francisco due to safety concerns.And you see here a slew of others have recently closed, including Amazon Go stores, Anthropology, Office Depot, Old Navy, as well as Saks Off 5th. And this also comes as San Francisco downtown area, you know, they continue to struggle to bring back foot traffic post-COVID as not many people, office employees, are going back there, as we continue to see vacancy rates rise in offices downtown. So certainly, lots of factors, but Starbucks saying here is simply a real estate play.- Brooke DiPalma, Thank you.]"

ZEUS, a prominent national metals service center, announced its acquisition of Central Tube &amp; Bar (CTB) in an all-cash deal. The purchase is expected to yield immediate positive financial results, although specific transaction terms have not been disclosed.CTB, established in 1996, operates across the Mid-South region with three facilities in Conway, AR, and Tulsa, OK. These facilities collectively encompass 162,000 square feet of warehouse and production space. CTB offers value-added fabrication services, including tube laser cutting, tube bending, robotic welding, flat laser burning, and brake press forming. In the trailing 12-month period ending Aug 31, 2023, CTB reported approximately $40 million in revenues.The core customer base of CTB includes large OEMs and fabricators in industries such as transportation, agriculture, commercial furniture, and data center construction. Its product range encompasses round, square, rectangular, and custom-shaped tubes.

Historically, Olympic Steel's tubular and pipe products segment has consistently boasted the highest EBITDA-to-sales margin. CTB's financial track record has consistently outperformed returns from tubular and pipe products.This acquisition expands the company's footprint into the burgeoning markets of the Mid-South and enhances its capabilities in value-added contract manufacturing. The integration of CTB into the tubular and pipe products segment, in conjunction with the existing success of the Chicago Tube &amp; Iron business, opens up substantial opportunities for growth and synergies.Story continuesCentral Tube &amp; Bar will be integrated into Olympic Steel’s tubular and pipe products segment, led by William Zielinski, President of Chicago Tube &amp; Iron.Following the acquisition of CTB, Olympic Steel's total debt under its revolving credit facility stands at nearly $234 million, with available funds of around $359 million.

The Canadian steel producer, known for its hot and cold rolled steel sheet and plate products, has extended its iron ore purchase contract with United States Steel Corporation X for an additional two years. Importantly, Algoma retains the option to further extend this contract for a third year at its discretion.This partnership extension with U.S. Steel is pivotal for Algoma as it advances its transformation journey toward electric arc furnace (EAF) steelmaking. The extended contract is expected to cover the iron ore volumes necessary to facilitate Algoma's transition from traditional blast furnace steelmaking to the more environmentally friendly EAF steel production method.This extension aligns seamlessly with Algoma's commitment to embracing sustainable steel production methods. Moreover, this agreement solidifies a dependable supply chain and guarantees continuous access to crucial raw materials. This, in turn, ensures that Algoma remains capable of meeting its production capacity needs and effectively catering to its valued customers throughout North America.The transition to EAF steelmaking is a significant step for Algoma in its commitment to reducing its carbon footprint and contributing to a greener, more sustainable future.

You can skip our detailed analysis of the global tourism industry, the revival of the tourism sector, the importance of cruise tourism, and online travel booking platforms, and go directly to Top 5 Most Beautiful Island Countries in the World. Exotic islands have been capturing our imagination in popular culture since Defoe’s novel Robinson Crusoe. Since the massification of leisure travel, the ‘unspoiled paradise’ of tropical islands has been a marketing meme promoting international tourism across the world – from the Caribbean to the Indian and Pacific Oceans. Although early tropical-island tourism was dominated by the so-called ‘snowbirds’ – the wealthy elite flocking to the Caribbean to escape the northern hemisphere’s winters – by the 1960s, rising disposable income and falling airfares led to waves of international tourists lapping at islands’ shores and the birth of the ‘pleasure periphery’ of the industrialized Global North. Consequently, of the 57 Small Island Developing States (SIDS) recognized by the U.N. today, the majority are highly dependent on international tourism from the Global North to fund their economies. The Global Tourism Industry:Tourism has evolved into a massive industry with time, encompassing several other sectors, such as hospitality, transport, entertainment etc. In 1950, at the dawn of the jet age, just 25 million people took foreign trips, and by 2019, that number had reached 1.5 billion. As we mentioned in our article – 30 Most Magical Places in the World – the global Travel &amp; Tourism (T&amp;T) industry is expected to grow at a CAGR of 3.1% between 2021 and 2026, to be worth an estimated $8.9 trillion by the end of the forecast period. The World Tourism and Travel Council has reported that the T&amp;T sector contributed 7.6% to the global GDP in 2022, an increase of 22% from 2021 and only 23% below 2019 levels. Story continuesRevival of the Tourism Sector: The T&amp;T industry was among the hardest hit by the pandemic, as people could no longer move around and the world came to an abrupt halt. Estimates from the United Nations World Tourism Organization show that international travel shrank by 72% in 2020, leading to 1.1 billion fewer trips taken and setting the industry back massively. However, 2022 witnessed a reversal in this trend as international borders began opening up, coupled with the disposable income people saved up during the lockdown, and their increasing longing to travel around. According to the WTO, more than 900 million tourists traveled internationally in 2022 - double the number recorded in 2021.The Importance of Cruise Tourism: For many destinations, in particular small Caribbean islands, cruises constitute more than 50% of the total of tourism arrivals generating important receipts through the services supplied by the port and expenditures of passengers and crew. In 2019, the global cruise industry welcomed 29.7 million passengers, created jobs for 1.8 million people around the world and contributed over $154 billion to the global economy. When WHO declared the global pandemic, Cruise Lines International Association (CLIA) member cruise lines announced a voluntary suspension of operations worldwide, making the sector one of the first to do so. However, 2022 saw a resurgence of the sector and the global volume of cruise passengers totaled just over 20 million last year. The United States, with its long coastlines and access to many nearby ports in the tropical Caribbean Sea, is the world’s leader in cruise revenue. The Miami-based Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd. (NYSE:RCL) is an important player in the industry. The company welcomed over 4.6 million passengers in 2022 and also boasts five of the world’s largest cruise ships in its fleet. In fact, Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd. (NYSE:RCL) has been making headlines recently because the cruise holding company is getting ready to launch the world’s largest cruise ship – Icon of the Seas – in January 2024. While some have labeled the colossal structure a ‘monstrosity’, citing its vast climate footprint, others are in awe of the sophisticated engineering integrated into this luxurious floating holiday destination and are flocking to buy tickets.The company is also moving ahead with the development of the first Royal Beach Club in the Bahamas this year after receiving approval from the government. Crafted in close collaboration with the Bahamian government, the new project will feature a public-private partnership in which Bahamians will be invited to own up to 49% equity.Ariel Investments, an investment management company, said the following in its Q2 2023 investor letter: “Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd. (NYSE:RCL), was one of the top 3 performers in the S&amp;P 500 during the quarter. Shares surged following a significant top- and bottom-line earnings beat, as stronger than anticipated consumer demand is driving a record WAVE season. Forward booking trends are also ahead of historical ranges at record pricing. These factors combined with further improvement in onboard spend and solid cost containment led management to increase RCL’s full-year 2023 guidance. We believe the revised revenue and earnings outlook lays the foundation for RCL to exceed its’ three-year strategic imperative, the Trifecta Program.”Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd. (NYSE:RCL) sits among the 10 Travel Stocks Billionaires Are Loading Up On. Online Travel Booking Platforms:  When the pandemic hit, the hospitality and tourism industry in the Caribbean wasn’t just hurt by the absence of visitors. It was faced with a larger conundrum – delayed payments from major international tour operators, such as TUI and Virgin Holidays, for services rendered in the first three months of 2020. By May 2020, 69% of hotels had reported being owed from $200,000 up to $15 million, according to the Caribbean Hotel and Tourism Association.However, a solution has emerged out of Barbados that could point to a groundbreaking model for the rest of the Caribbean region. Launched at the close of 2021, BookBarbados.com, a Barbadian-owned and independently funded and operated online travel booking platform, allows users to buy hotel stays ranging from luxury to budget, local tours, Airbnb rentals, and long term stays all in one place. The site also taps into local influencer recommendations for a more authentic version of the island.With a market cap of about $108.73 billion, Booking Holdings Inc. (NASDAQ:BKNG) holds the title of being the largest travel company in the world. Operating in over 220 countries and 40 different languages, there are more than 28 million global listings available between hotels, homes, and apartments under the Booking Holdings Inc. (NASDAQ:BKNG) travel sites. The platform can also help to book flights and cruise trips to your Favorite Island Destinations. The online travel agency also strongly felt the shocks of the pandemic when its revenue fell by almost 55%, from $15.06 billion in 2019, to $6.8 billion in 2020. However, Booking Holdings Inc. (NASDAQ:BKNG) boasted a revenue of $17.09 billion in 2022 after the revival of international tourism, even higher than its pre-pandemic levels. Glen Fogel, the CEO and President of Booking, said the following in the company’s Q2 Earnings Call Transcript: “I am pleased to report that in the second quarter we continue to see robust leisure travel demand which helped drive the strong results we are announcing today. The 268 million room nights booked in the second quarter increased by 9% year-over-year and gross bookings of $39.7 billion grew 15% year-over-year and was the highest quarterly gross bookings ever. Both room nights and gross bookings came in ahead of our previous expectations as a result of the favorable demand environment. Revenue growth of 27% in Q2 also nicely outperformed our expectations. The strong top line results in the quarter combined with better-than-expected marketing efficiency helped drive our Q2 adjusted EBITDA to about $1.8 billion which is an increase of 64% versus Q2 last year, and meaningfully exceeded our prior growth expectations of about 35%.”Booking Holdings Inc. (NASDAQ:BKNG) ranks among the 10 Stocks with AI Catalysts in 2023. With that said, here are the Best Island Countries to Visit. Top 20 Most Beautiful Island Countries in the WorldMethodology: To collect data for this article, we have referred to a number of sources such as Islands Magazine, Travel + Leisure, Reddit etc, looking for the Most Beautiful Island Countries in 2023. We picked countries that appeared at least twice in these sources, assigned them a score based on their number of appearances, and ranked them accordingly. When two countries had the same score, we ranked them by the number of tourists they received in 2022. If you’re also interested in heritage tourism, here are the 30 Must-See UNESCO World Heritage Sites. 20. SamoaInsider Monkey Score: 2No. of Tourists in 2022: 17,497No. of Tourists in 2019: 181,000Percentage Change in the No. of Tourists Post-Covid: -90.3% Samoa fully reopened its borders on the 1st of August 2022 after two-and-a-half years of shutdown due to Covid-19. The country’s visitor arrivals have boosted its tourism sector recovery rate to 60% this year, but the Samoa Tourism Authority believes more time is needed for full recovery. Tourism is an important contributor to the Samoan economy. The sector accounted for 24.5% of the country’s GDP in 2019, and is second only to remittances as a source of foreign exchange earnings. 19. MadagascarInsider Monkey Score: 2No. of Tourists in 2022: 132.018No. of Tourists in 2019: 486,000Percentage Change in the No. of Tourists Post-Covid: -72.8%With the reopening of borders in April 2022, after two years of isolation from the rest of the world, tourism in Madagascar is slowly but surely regaining momentum. Despite an undeniable attraction for Madagascar as a destination, renowned for its one of a kind biodiversity, heavenly beaches, and favorable weather, the island only welcomed 132,018 tourists last year, almost three times less than pre-pandemic. Reasons for this slow revival can be explained by a lack of services and the soaring prices of plane tickets, according to the Confederation of Tourism of Madagascar.18. St. Kitts &amp; NevisInsider Monkey Score: 2No. of Tourists in 2022: 537,300No. of Tourists in 2019: 1.18 millionPercentage Change in the No. of Tourists Post-Covid: -54.5%St. Kitts and Nevis imposed strict Covid-related travel restrictions during the early phase of the pandemic, which may have shifted its tourist market share towards Caribbean peers with fewer restrictions. The restrictions were lifted in August 2022, and the country welcomed 537,300 tourists last year. The outlook for 2023 is positive but global conditions are getting in the way of a faster recovery. High inflation, tightening global financial conditions, and volatile commodity prices may negatively impact growth in the U.S., Canada, and the U.K. – the country’s main source markets. 17. BarbadosInsider Monkey Score: 2No. of Tourists in 2022: 539,746No. of Tourists in 2019: 966,000Percentage Change in the No. of Tourists Post-Covid: -44.1%The pandemic has had severe socioeconomic impacts in Barbados due to the heavy dependence on tourism, which accounts for about 40% of jobs, more than half of which belong to women. The economy contracted by an estimated 18% in 2020, and unemployment claims reached roughly one-third of the workforce during the year. The World Bank approved a $100 million COVID-19 Response and Recovery Development Policy Loan for Barbados in 2021.Located in the southeastern Caribbean Sea, Barbados is one of the Most Beautiful Islands in the World. 16. CuraçaoInsider Monkey Score: 2No. of Tourists in 2022: 1.03 millionNo. of Tourists in 2019: 1.27 millionPercentage Change in the No. of Tourists Post-Covid: -18.9%Curaçao welcomed 1,034,429 tourist arrivals altogether last year. The Curaçao Ports Authority recorded 533,831 cruise arrivals, while the Curaçao Tourist Board registered 489,559 stayover visitors who altogether spent 4.6 million nights in the island nation. The Ministry of Economic Development, together with Curaçao Tourist Board, calculated the total economic impact (direct + indirect) including cruise tourism at $1.4 billion in 2022. 15. IcelandInsider Monkey Score: 2No. of Tourists in 2022: 1.89 millionNo. of Tourists in 2019: 2.2 millionPercentage Change in the No. of Tourists Post-Covid: -14.1%Though receipts from tourism fell from $3.4 billion in 2019 to only $814 million in 2020, the Icelandic government invested heavily on marketing the destination during the pandemic. Opened to travel since June 2020, the country had a very low Covid case count, making it attractive for people who still wanted to travel amid the lockdowns. Another important factor has been the historic stopover strategy of its flagship carrier, Icelandair. The airline is connected to multiple European destinations and lets travelers add a 1 to 7 day stopover in Iceland at no extra charge on the way to their other destinations. 14. The Dominican RepublicInsider Monkey Score: 2No. of Tourists in 2022: 8.5 million No. of Tourists in 2019: 7.55 millionPercentage Change in the No. of Tourists Post-Covid: 12.6%In 2022, the revenue generated by the tourism sector in the Dominican Republic amounted to approximately $8.4 billion, growing by roughly 48% compared to the previous year. In 2021, tourism revenue in the country had already started to recover from the impact of the coronavirus pandemic, having experienced an annual increase of more than 110%.The Dominican Republic is home to some of the Best Islands in the World. 13.

Under the initiative, 100 applicants are chosen to provide maintenance work for some of the Faroe Islands’ popular tourist destinations. Since it first launched in 2019, Closed for Maintenance has become an annual program and continues to be popular. In the first year, applications totaled 3,500, grew to 10,000 in 2020, and 14,000 in 2021. 12.

Prime Minister Andrew Holness said the problems at Sangster International Airport underscored the need to push through the $70 million modernization and expansion project that was already underway.Jamaica boasts some of the Most Beautiful Islands in the Caribbean. 8.

If you want to see more stocks in this selection, go directly to the 5 Best Bear Market Stocks To Buy Now.The US economy successfully avoided a recession owing to its resilient job market. However, it's worth noting that the job market is usually one of the last facets to weaken when interest rates rise. A recurring pattern has emerged in such economic cycles - out of the last nine instances of Federal Reserve rate hikes, seven resulted in an economic recession. The optimism among investors regarding AI's potential to enhance productivity and drive a new phase of growth played a significant role in the stock market's recovery from the severe drop experienced in 2022, particularly in the first half of this year. Despite the Federal Reserve's decision to raise interest rates as a measure to combat inflation, the S&amp;P 500 made an impressive leap of approximately 20%, briefly touching 4600 by the end of July. For Ed Yardeni, the founder of Yardeni Research, this surge was anticipated, albeit arriving ""ahead of schedule,"" indicating an imminent short-term decline.On October 1, Yardeni reflected on his earlier analysis, stating, ""We concluded that the index might fall to its 200-day moving average, which is currently around 4200."" True to that prediction, since that point, the S&amp;P 500 has indeed experienced a decline of about 7%, reaching around 4,280 by midday on October 2. Yardeni suggests that the index could very well decline further to meet their projected 4,200 mark sometime in October. However, beyond that, he foresees a rebound in the market. In recent months, several economists have revised their growth forecasts for the third-quarter GDP, citing the labor market's resilience and strong consumer spending. The economic forecasters on the panel at the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia revised their outlook in August, now anticipating real GDP growth of 1.9% at an annual rate for the third quarter. This represents a significant increase from their initial June forecast of just 0.6%.Story continuesMost Wall Street investors, however, remain unconvinced by the stock market's gains in 2023, fearing a potential further retreat due to looming recession risks. This sentiment was revealed in the recent CNBC Delivering Alpha investor survey, which gathered opinions from approximately 300 key figures in finance, including chief investment officers, equity strategists, portfolio managers, and CNBC contributors. The survey, aimed to gauge investor outlooks on the markets for the remainder of 2023 and beyond, revealed that over 60% of respondents view this year's stock market gain as merely a temporary bounce within a bear market, foreseeing more challenges on the horizon. On the contrary, 39% of investors believe that a new bull market has already begun.As the year progresses into its latter half, the stock market is already displaying signs of the anticipated recession effects, aligning with J.P. Morgan Research's predictions. It foresees a gradual economic downturn in the United States by late 2023 due to the cautious approach taken by the Federal Reserve, resulting in stricter credit conditions that will slowly exert downward pressure on economic growth. While numerous stocks are experiencing a downward trajectory, specific industries are thriving amidst this economic strain, making their respective stocks appealing investment prospects for global investors. Some notable sectors include Utilities, Healthcare, Consumer Staples, Communication Services, DIY, and related industries. These stocks generally possess a safeguarded profitability, less susceptible to economic cycle fluctuations and changes in consumer confidence.Given the situation, investors are actively seeking out top-performing stocks during a bear market to safeguard their investments. Notably, companies such as Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (NYSE:BRK-B), Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG), and Visa Inc. (NYSE:V) are drawing the interest of investors amid the prevailing bearish trend in the markets.Most Promising Tech Stocks According to AnalystsPhoto by Adam Nowakowski on UnsplashOur MethodologyOur list for the best bear market stocks to buy is grounded in hedge fund sentiment towards each stock.

CVS has been moving its portfolio to a more value-based outcome model, and Aetna was a major move in that direction. We were willing to accept the leverage that came with the deal because CVS has a very cash generative model, and we anticipated the free cash flow would enable the company to de-lever fairly quickly.By mid-2022, CVS was in a position to use the free cash flow that had been going to debt repayment to do bolt-on deals to further prepare for the value-based outcome model and/or return more cash to shareholders in the form of higher dividends or share repurchases. However, CVS lost a “star” in its largest Medicare plan in late 2022 and this will adversely impact earnings in 2024. This was a surprise and disappointment to us, but management should be able to regain the “star” in the back half of 2023, which will then give the company a nice tailwind in 2025…” (Click here to read the full text)12.

Ideally, a business will show two trends; firstly a growing return on capital employed (ROCE) and secondly, an increasing amount of capital employed. Put simply, these types of businesses are compounding machines, meaning they are continually reinvesting their earnings at ever-higher rates of return. So, when we ran our eye over Amphenol's (NYSE:APH) trend of ROCE, we really liked what we saw.Understanding Return On Capital Employed (ROCE)For those that aren't sure what ROCE is, it measures the amount of pre-tax profits a company can generate from the capital employed in its business. The formula for this calculation on Amphenol is:Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)0.21 = US$2.6b ÷ (US$15b - US$2.7b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to June 2023).Thus, Amphenol has an ROCE of 21%.  That's a fantastic return and not only that, it outpaces the average of 13% earned by companies in a similar industry. See our latest analysis for Amphenol roceIn the above chart we have measured Amphenol's prior ROCE against its prior performance, but the future is arguably more important. If you'd like to see what analysts are forecasting going forward, you should check out our free report for Amphenol.The Trend Of ROCEIt's hard not to be impressed by Amphenol's returns on capital. The company has consistently earned 21% for the last five years, and the capital employed within the business has risen 75% in that time. Now considering ROCE is an attractive 21%, this combination is actually pretty appealing because it means the business can consistently put money to work and generate these high returns. If these trends can continue, it wouldn't surprise us if the company became a multi-bagger.What We Can Learn From Amphenol's ROCEIn short, we'd argue Amphenol has the makings of a multi-bagger since its been able to compound its capital at very profitable rates of return. On top of that, the stock has rewarded shareholders with a remarkable 103% return to those who've held over the last five years. So while investors seem to be recognizing these promising trends, we still believe the stock deserves further research.Story continuesOn the other side of ROCE, we have to consider valuation.

However, it is important to know that the US has a major travel and tourism market, and some of these overrated cities in our list, as voted by redditors, are actually very popular travel destinations.In one of our articles about the best all-inclusive resorts, we discussed that the global hotel, resorts, and cruise industry is dominated by North America and is expected to experience significant growth in the coming years. The demand for traveling is booming, and the market in the US is growing significantly to reach beyond pre-pandemic levels.Before we take a look at the most overrated cities in the US according to reddit, let’s take a look at the US travel and tourism market and what some of the key players in the market are up to.Market in the US to Lead Global Travel &amp; Tourism ReboundThe World Travel &amp; Tourism Council reported, on August 22, new insights into the strong growth of the US travel and tourism sector, which grew by 16.9% in 2022 while also creating about 2.7 million more jobs as compared to the previous year. Moreover, domestic visitor spending has almost reached its pre-pandemic levels in the US travel and tourism sector, and the comeback and growth is also reflected in statistics of US airports, which continue to be some of the world’s most busiest airports.According to a report by Research And Markets, the US travel and tourism market was valued at around $1.68 trillion in 2022. The market is expected to grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 5% during 2022-2027, propelling the market to reach above $2.15 trillion by the end of the forecasted period. As lockdowns around the world have cooled down, and travel options are back in full swing, the travel and tourism industry is expected to grow significantly in the coming years. The travel and tourism market includes revenues generated by passenger airlines, hotels, restaurants, casinos, resorts, and the gaming market.Story continuesDue to a surge in disposable income, travel and tourism is gaining popularity among the middle class population. Moreover, rising adoption of technology has led to a surge in online bookings as travelers enjoy and prefer the convenience that travel websites, mobile apps, and online booking platforms have to offer. This is expected to further augment market growth during the forecast period.Major US Travel &amp; Tourism Companies: What Are They Up To?With a desire to increase profits and their market share, travel and tourism companies are working towards offering travelers more convenient and affordable options in response to the growing demand for travel.Booking Holdings Inc. (NASDAQ:BKNG) is one of the world’s largest providers of online travel and related services. It's the parent company of several popular travel booking brands, including Booking.com, Priceline, Agoda, Rentalcars.com, and KAYAK. On June 27, Booking Holdings Inc.

Users can check out potential travel destinations and accommodation options, as well as get travel inspiration and create itineraries based on their needs and requirements.Companies that operate and offer hospitality services, including hotels and resorts, are expected to benefit from the increase in travel demand. On July 17, Reuters reported that Marriott International Inc. (NYSE:MAR) and MGM Resorts International (NYSE:MGM) are joining hands and getting creative with their loyalty programs to offer benefits and retain customers as the demand for travel, concerts and sporting events surges across the US. The two travel companies launched ""MGM Collection with Marriott Bonvoy,"" which would make MGM Resorts International’s (NYSE:MGM) 40 million members globally eligible for the Bonvoy loyalty program. On the other hand, members of the Marriott International Inc.’s (NYSE:MAR) Bonvoy rewards program can earn and redeem points to stay at all MGM resorts across the US and Canada.Here are some comments from Marriott International Inc.’s (NYSE:MAR) Q2 2023 earnings call:“As we focus on paths for growth, we are adding new offerings and experiences in segments where we believe there is strong consumer interest beyond our current brands. A great example is our recent announcement of an exclusive 20-year strategic license agreement with MGM Resorts International and the creation of MGM Collection with Marriott Bonvoy. The collection, which will launch beginning in October, encompasses 17 resorts with 40,000 rooms. This deal will provide us with significant presence in Las Vegas, one of the most popular destinations in the country with fantastic properties like Bellagio, the MGM Grand, and ARIA, as well as additional distribution in five other key US cities. Beyond just hotels, our strategic agreement with MGM will also give our members access to more sports, music, culinary and entertainment experiences.”On August 1, Marriott International Inc.

The sale of XRP on public exchanges to retail customers, she said in July, did comply with federal securities laws.Her initial ruling was hailed as a victory in the crypto world, and her decision on Wednesday to deny the SEC's appeal was also celebrated by some industry participants.""This victory is another example of a court halting the SEC's efforts of regulation by enforcement"" against crypto firms, said Daniel Stabile, a legal partner with the law firm Winston &amp; Strawn, which represents both Ripple Labs and cryptocurrency exchange Binance in other legal matters.XRP (XRP-USD), the fifth-largest crypto token, which was originally created and issued by Ripple Labs, rose 5% Tuesday.Crypto stocks including those for Coinbase Global (COIN), Microstrategy (MSTR), and bitcoin mining firms, Marathon Digital (MARA) and Riot Platforms, Inc (RIOT) rose at Wednesday's open between 1%-3% but gave back those gains by 11 a.m. ET.The SEC and its chair Gary Gensler have argued repeatedly that certain cryptocurrencies are securities and therefore should be overseen by the US agency, using that assertion as the basis for several lawsuits against major industry players.SEC Chair Gary Gensler testifies during before the House Financial Services Committee in September. (Tom Williams/CQ-Roll Call, Inc via Getty Images) (Tom Williams via Getty Images)It has brought a string of enforcement actions against crypto investors and businesses since the beginning of January.

Another federal judge, Jed Rakoff, said on July 31 that digital currencies can be considered securities when sold to the general public, contradicting the earlier ruling from Torres. His case involves Terraform Labs' Terra USD token.Torres on Wednesday said her decision did not conflict with Rakoff's ruling.

(NASDAQ:MARA) (""Marathon"" or ""Company""), a leader in supporting and securing the Bitcoin ecosystem, today published unaudited bitcoin (“BTC”) production and miner installation updates for September 2023.Management Commentary“We produced 1,242 bitcoin in September, which is a 16% increase from last month and a 245% increase from September of last year,” said Fred Thiel, Marathon’s chairman and CEO. “The increase in bitcoin production from August was due to improved uptime and decreased curtailment activity in Texas. In September, our share of the bitcoin network’s available miner rewards was a record 4.3%, up from 3.7% last month and the previous record of 4.1% in July 2023.“Energization of the facility in Garden City, Texas is still pending. However, based on the latest updates, we believe the facility will start to come online this month. While our hosting provider completes the final steps to energize the site, the Marathon team has focused on increasing uptime at our other locations, especially in McCamey, Texas. By upgrading equipment, leveraging our proprietary firmware, and making other technical improvements, we increased our U.S. average operational hash rate 20% month-over-month to 15.8 exahashes. We believe there is still room for improvement at our McCamey site, and we are working with our hosting provider to further increase uptime.“Outside the US, our joint venture in Abu Dhabi mined 50 bitcoin in September of which approximately 10 bitcoin is our share. Construction is nearly complete at our second, larger site, and we continue to expect the project’s full 7.0 exahashes to be online before year-end 2023.Story continues“In September, we opportunistically retired the majority of our convertible debt at a significant discount. This accretive transaction creates shareholder value and positions Marathon to capitalize on any near-term turbulence in the Bitcoin mining sector. With the next halving just over six months away, our balance sheet is now a source of strength that allows us to focus on further increasing efficiency and lowering costs.“Our primary focus is still growth. Now that we have reached our primary domestic growth target of 23 exahashes on an installed basis, we are evaluating multiple opportunities for our next 5 exahashes of hash rate capacity including international locations with low-cost renewable energy. We expect to announce specifics on our expansion plans in the weeks ahead.“Lastly, I’d like to remind our shareholders to vote in the upcoming Special Meeting of Shareholders, now scheduled for November 10, 2023. We adjourned the previous meeting because we did not receive enough votes to achieve a quorum. We also recently provided more details about our Long-Term Incentive Plan or LTIP. Please note our LTIP is solely based on Marathon stock price performance relative to our closest peers which we believe to be fully aligned with shareholder interests.”Operational Highlights and UpdatesFigure 1: U.S. Operational HighlightsMetric 9/30/2023  9/30/2022  % Δ  9/30/2023  8/31/2023  % Δ Bitcoin Produced - U.S. Only  1,232   360   242%  1,232   1,062   16%Average Bitcoin Produced per Day  41.1   12.0   242%  41.1   34.3   20%Energized Hash Rate (EH/s)1  19.1   3.8   403%  19.1   19.1   —% Average Operational Hash Rate (EH/s)2  15.8   NA       15.8   13.2   20%Installed Hash Rate (EH/s)3  23.1   3.8   508%  23.1   23.1   —% 1.

252,d859437e-6212-3c7d-bfeb-f0a47e426934,NWSA,2023-10-05,Realtor.com® September Housing Report: Home Prices Rise As Inventory Crunch Continues,PR Newswire,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/realtor-com-september-housing-report-100000228.html,1696500000,STORY,"['NWS', 'NWSA', 'NWSAL']","[In September, active inventory shrank on an annual basis for the third month in a row, despite boost from August's unseasonal bump in new listings While home prices rose annually, a surprising uptick in price-reduced homes from August to September reflects last year's trend and offers some relief amid ongoing affordability concernsSANTA CLARA, Calif., Oct. 5, 2023 /PRNewswire/ -- For the second month in a row, home prices rose on an annual basis in September (+0.4%) as the inventory shortfall lingers, with the number of homes on the market falling year over year for the third consecutive month (-4.0%), according to the Realtor.com® September Monthly Housing Trends Report released today. Active inventory remained 45.1% below pre–pandemic (2017-2019) levels, although the number of homes for sale increased month-over-month (4.9%) in September, contrary to typical seasonal trends but attributable to the unusual bump in new listings in August.This month, new listings realigned with typical declines between August and September. However, despite persistent inventory challenges bolstering prices, an unseasonable month-over-month uptick in price reductions hints at potential market adjustments. While a greater share of homes saw price reductions during the past month than expected for this time of year, the percentage of homes with price reductions decreased year over year, from 20.2% in September of last year to 17.8% this year, and remains below typical levels seen from 2017 to 2019. This suggests that buyer and seller expectations aren't significantly misaligned, at least for now.""An uptick in homes with reduced prices is a small break for buyers on top of the usual seasonal factors that align to make this first week in October the best week to buy. Yet, the larger context remains challenging. Buyers still struggle with the triple threat of rising listing prices, record-high mortgage rates, and limited inventory, making affordability a continued concern,"" said Danielle Hale, Chief Economist for Realtor.com®. ""The number of homes for sale is likely to remain low as higher mortgage rates leave many homeowners feeling 'locked in' to their current rates. Data shows low inventory is pushing many homebuyers toward new homes, but the growth in new construction isn't enough to sufficiently narrow the inventory gap.""Story continuesWhat it means for homebuyers, sellers, and the housing marketWhile the unexpected rise in new home listings from July to August led to higher September inventory than typically seen this time of year, homes are selling quickly, keeping overall inventory limited. This scarcity has been a driving factor in maintaining high listing prices.Despite a greater share of homes with price reductions, affordability headwinds continue: higher mortgage rates have increased the monthly cost of financing 80% of the typical home by roughly $256 (+12.4%) compared to a year ago, far outpacing wage growth (+4.3%) and inflation (+3.7%).""Homes on the market are still moving quickly, indicating that many buyers are accepting today's high prices and mortgage rates and adjusting their expectations,"" said Realtor.com®'s Executive News Editor Clare Trapasso. ""That may mean a number of things: settling for less space or moving farther away from large cities or to a different region.""To help determine their best next step, potential homebuyers can tap into Realtor.com® RealCost tools, including the Affordability Calculator or the Rent vs. Buy Calculator.September 2023 Housing Metrics – NationalMetricChange over Sep 2022Change over Sep 2019Median listing price+0.4% (to $430,000)+37.5 %Active listings-4.0 %-42.7 %New listings-9.1 %-21.0 %Median days on market+1 days (to 48 days)-14 daysShare of active listings with price reductions-2.5 percentage points (to 17.8%)+0.3 percentage pointsListing prices stay steady, but price cuts climb uncharacteristicallyIn September, the national median home listing price declined seasonally from August, but increased slightly over September 2022, marking the second month in a row that listing prices have increased on an annual basis. Limited inventory has kept listing prices high, and while new home sales are elevated, new construction hasn't been able to fully address inventory constraints. Meanwhile, although the share of price-reduced homes is down compared with last September, month-over-month growth is beginning to mirror last year's trend, with price cuts accelerating in the fall as high listing prices and interest rates deter many buyers.While the U.S. median list price saw a seasonal monthly decline, to $430,000 from $435,000 in August, it is up +0.4% compared to last year.All regions saw active listing prices in larger metros increase on average, but Northeastern metros saw the highest annual growth rate (+10.0%).Prices in Los Angeles (+23.8%), San Diego (+18.2%), and Richmond, Va.. (+15.0%) saw the biggest increases among large metros, predominantly due to larger and more expensive homes coming on the market in these areas. Larger Southern metros saw the lowest listing price growth rate among the regions (3.1%).Among the largest 50 metros, only eight saw their median list price decline, led by San Antonio (-2.8%), Memphis, Tenn. (-2.1%), and Houston (-1.5%).Nationally, the share of homes with price reductions decreased from 20.2% in September of last year to 17.8% this year and remains below 2017-2019 levels on average.Fourteen of the 50 large metros saw the share of price reductions increase compared to last September, predominantly in the South and Midwest. Memphis, Tenn., saw the greatest increase (+6.0 percentage points), followed by Indianapolis (+4.4), and San Antonio (+3.4).Inventory rises from August levels, yet remains scarceWhile newly listed homes showed an unusual increase from July to August this year, higher mortgage rates and more typical seasonality realigned inventory with the expected seasonal decline from August to September. Year over year, the number of homes actively for sale decreased on an annual basis in September for the third consecutive month, following a period of growth starting in April 2022. This can be attributed in part to highly unseasonal inventory growth in 2022 as the market slowed down late last summer and into fall. However, the gap between this September and the same time last year is narrowing, as inventory increased month over month on the heels of an unexpected bump in new listings in August. Even so, active inventory remained below typical 2017-2019 levels.Nationally, active inventory in September dropped -4.0% year-over-year. Despite an increase in homes for sale from August to September (+4.9%), active inventory remains -45.1% below 2017-2019 levels.Pending listings fell -12.2% from the same time last year, more than August's -11.5% decline due in part to higher mortgage rates in July and August, but significantly better than December's peak decline (-36.9% year over year). Pending listings are an early indicator of future sales, which slowed to an annual pace of 4.04 million in August.Newly listed homes fell -9.1% compared to September last year, more than August's -7.5% year-over-year drop.Regionally, inventory grew slightly in the South, by 1.5% compared to September 2022, but declined year-over-year in the West (-27.7%), Northeast (-12.9%), and Midwest (-6.9%).In the 50 largest U.S. metro areas, the number of homes for sale is -41.9% below pre-pandemic levels. Inventory decreased in 36 out of 50 of the largest metros compared to last year, although some Southern metros saw significant growth, such as Memphis, Tenn. (+35.6%), New Orleans (28.4%) and San Antonio (24.4%).Among the top 50 metros, San Antonio (+4.4%), and Buffalo, N.Y. (+2.1%) saw new listings increase. Declines in newly listed homes were greatest in Las Vegas (-31.7%), New York, N.Y. (-23.6%) and Detroit, Mich. (-21.9%).Homes selling two weeks faster than pre-pandemic periodWhile the time the typical home spent on the market remained fairly flat year over year this September, the typical home spent two weeks less on the market this past month than during the average September from 2017 to 2019. Time on market is rising more slowly this year, as homebuyers compete for limited supply.In September, the typical home spent 48 days on the market, only one day longer than the same time in 2022, but two weeks less than in the average September between 2017 and 2019.Regionally, only large metros in the South saw time on market increase on average year-over-year (+1 day). Large metros in the Northeast spent 2 days less on the market, those in the Midwest spent 3 days less on the market, and homes spent 4 days less than last year in the West.Time on market increased in 17 of the 50 largest metros, including New Orleans (+11 days), Austin, Texas (+8 days), and Nashville, Tenn. (+6 days).Time on market decreased compared to last year in 30 of the 50 largest metro areas. The largest drops were in San Jose, Calif., San Francisco (-9 days), and Sacramento, Calif. (-8 days). This is primarily because this region experienced the most significant slowdown last year when interest rates rose.September 2023 Housing Overview by Top 50 Largest Metros Metro AreaMedian Listing PriceMedian Listing Price YoYMedian Listing Price per Sq.

254,2317a611-f4a4-37a9-8dca-8ed4bd7ae921,SNA,2023-10-05,Are You Looking for a High-Growth Dividend Stock?,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/looking-high-growth-dividend-stock-154507331.html,1696434307,STORY,['SNA'],"[All investors love getting big returns from their portfolio, whether it's through stocks, bonds, ETFs, or other types of securities. But when you're an income investor, your primary focus is generating consistent cash flow from each of your liquid investments.Cash flow can come from bond interest, interest from other types of investments, and of course, dividends. A dividend is the distribution of a company's earnings paid out to shareholders; it's often viewed by its dividend yield, a metric that measures a dividend as a percent of the current stock price. Many academic studies show that dividends make up large portions of long-term returns, and in many cases, dividend contributions surpass one-third of total returns.Snap-On in FocusSnap-On (SNA) is headquartered in Kenosha, and is in the Consumer Discretionary sector. The stock has seen a price change of 11.14% since the start of the year. The tool and diagnostic equipment maker is paying out a dividend of $1.62 per share at the moment, with a dividend yield of 2.55% compared to the Tools - Handheld industry's yield of 1.04% and the S&amp;P 500's yield of 1.75%.Taking a look at the company's dividend growth, its current annualized dividend of $6.48 is up 10.2% from last year. Over the last 5 years, Snap-On has increased its dividend 5 times on a year-over-year basis for an average annual increase of 13.78%. Looking ahead, future dividend growth will be dependent on earnings growth and payout ratio, which is the proportion of a company's annual earnings per share that it pays out as a dividend. Right now, Snap-On's payout ratio is 36%, which means it paid out 36% of its trailing 12-month EPS as dividend.SNA is expecting earnings to expand this fiscal year as well. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2023 is $18.45 per share, which represents a year-over-year growth rate of 9.69%.Bottom LineInvestors like dividends for a variety of different reasons, from tax advantages and decreasing overall portfolio risk to considerably improving stock investing profits. It's important to keep in mind that not all companies provide a quarterly payout.Story continuesHigh-growth firms or tech start-ups, for example, rarely provide their shareholders a dividend, while larger, more established companies that have more secure profits are often seen as the best dividend options. Income investors have to be mindful of the fact that high-yielding stocks tend to struggle during periods of rising interest rates. With that in mind, SNA is a compelling investment opportunity. Not only is it a strong dividend play, but the stock currently sits at a Zacks Rank of 3 (Hold).Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Yahoo will also own a stake in Vespa and hold a seat on the spun-out firm's board of directors.Yahoo created Vespa back in 2005 after acquiring paid search service provider Overture, and, through it, a Norwegian search engine called AlltheWeb.com. Working with the e-commerce division within Yahoo, the AllTheWeb team of roughly 30 people retooled their search tech into a more general-purpose tool that Yahoo developers could use internally to compute over large-scale datasets in real time.Over the next decade or so, Yahoo expanded Vespa along several directions, enabling the tool to handle input beyond text strings, personalize content based on users' click-through histories and take direction from machine learning algorithms. Then, in 2017, Yahoo open sourced Vespa, hoping to rally developer support behind the software -- and foster something of an ecosystem both internally and externally.It was arguably Yahoo's biggest open source software release since Hadoop in 2006, involving a substantial rewrite of the Vespa codebase by the Vespa group, still based in Norway. And it evidently paid off. Today, Vespa drives searches and related-article recommendations on Yahoo-owned sites and performs ad targeting on Yahoo-branded web properties such as Yahoo Sports, Yahoo Finance, Yahoo News and Yahoo's advertising network.Yahoo claims that it's using around 150 apps created with Vespa and that these apps collectively serve a user base of a billion people -- processing 800,000 queries per second.Story continuesOutside of Yahoo, thousands of brands, including Spotify, OkCupid and Wix, now use either the open source release of Vespa or the cloud-hosted, fully managed version sold by Yahoo, Vespa Cloud. And Vespa's open source package has been downloaded over 10 million times.While there's a number of open source alternatives to Vespa available, including Solr and Elasticsearch, Yahoo makes the case that Vespa goes ""several steps further"" than what's on the market.""The biggest differentiator stems from our vision of providing for the complete needs of any application that combines data and AI at scale online,"" Bratseth told me via email. ""We have a very experienced team who are all working on improving Vespa to this vision, and a culture of continuously shipping improvements, and -- from what I can see -- we're still moving much faster than any others.""So why spin Vespa out into its own company? Capacity, Bratseth says.""A growing number of companies are asking to deploy their applications to our cloud service, and we’ll have more capacity to build out this functionality as a stand-alone,"" he told me.I wonder whether Yahoo's plan to return to the public markets had something to do with the move, too. But neither Bratseth nor Lara Davis, Yahoo's chief strategy officer, would confirm or deny this. (I tried to reach Yahoo CEO Jim Lanzone for comment through a Yahoo spokesperson, but was told he was traveling.)""Since 2017, Vespa has been helping customers perform a variety of AI-powered tasks: searching millions of documents within a global organization, serving better data-driven online ads or allowing AI-based language apps the ability to scale,"" Davis said. ""We know Vespa is the market-leading technology for doing that at scale, so the opportunity for Yahoo to continue as both an investor and customer, continuing to root for their success, is a phenomenal outcome for everyone. As part of the deal, we are migrating key proprietary and battle-tested platform technology to Vespa and will continue to support many of their systems as they transition to an independent company.""Lanzone did provide a prepared statement more or less echoing what Davis said:""Vespa has been a critical component to Yahoo’s AI and machine learning capabilities across all of our properties for many years,"" he said in a press release. ""While remaining Vespa’s biggest customer and a key investor, we’ll continue to leverage all that Vespa has to offer while simultaneously creating a new business opportunity that allows other companies to harness its technology as an independent entity.""This article originally appeared on TechCrunch at https://techcrunch.com/2023/10/04/yahoo-spins-out-vespa-its-search-tech-into-an-independent-company/]"

The winners are provided with funding and ongoing business support to help scale their solutions and reach more in-need communities.“The Climate Resilience Prize underscores our commitment to support entrepreneurs and change-agents innovating to help limit the impacts of climate change on vulnerable communities, and to foster their creativity in strengthening targeted solutions in the areas of technology, community infrastructure, ecosystems and more,” said Carrie Hughes, Director of Social Innovation for Verizon.The launch of the second Verizon Climate Resilience Prize was announced at the Aspen Ideas: Climate Conference in Miami, Florida in March 2023. Based on an expert-led panel of judges, the below four winners were recognized as creatively and effectively using technology and digital strategies.Story continuesAn overview of each of the winners can be found below:Sesame Solar Inc: As extreme weather increases, Sesame Solar Inc. is breaking the dirty cycle of fossil fuel-powered generators that further contribute to climate change—replacing them with renewable, mobile energy solutions that are durable, easy-to-use, and flexible for a variety of use cases.10Power: 10Power’s renewable energy projects create climate resilience through on-site energy generation, and for many projects, energy storage.Raincoat: Raincoat's mission is to protect every person on the planet from the financial disruption of natural disasters. They collaborate with insurers, financial institutions, nonprofits, and governments to underwrite parametric flood insurance policies.Perimeter: The Perimeter Platform is a solution that supports information sharing and collaboration, making real-time evacuation management software accessible to all types of first responders and the public.The Climate Resilience Prize, which launched in 2021, is part of Citizen Verizon, the company’s responsible business plan for economic, environmental, and social advancement.

Of course, one figure often stands out among the rest: earnings.The earnings figure itself is key, but a beat or miss on the bottom line can sometimes be just as, if not more, important. Therefore, investors should consider paying close attention to these earnings surprises, as a big beat can help a stock climb even higher.2 Stocks to Add to Your WatchlistThe Zacks Expected Surprise Prediction, or ESP, works by locking in on the most up-to-date analyst earnings revisions because they can be more accurate than estimates from weeks or even months before the actual release date. The thinking is pretty straightforward: analysts who provide earnings estimates closer to the report are likely to have more information. With this in mind, the Expected Surprise Prediction compares the Most Accurate Estimate (being the most recent) against the overall Zacks Consensus Estimate. The percentage difference provides the ESP figure.Now that we understand what the ESP is and how beneficial it can be, let's dive into a stock that currently fits the bill. Stanley Black &amp; Decker (SWK) earns a Zacks Rank #3 right now and its Most Accurate Estimate sits at $0.85 a share, just 23 days from its upcoming earnings release on October 27, 2023.SWK has an Earnings ESP figure of 3.2%, which, as explained above, is calculated by taking the percentage difference between the $0.85 Most Accurate Estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $0.82.SWK is part of a big group of Industrial Products stocks that boast a positive ESP, and investors may want to take a look at Cintas (CTAS) as well.Slated to report earnings on December 20, 2023, Cintas holds a #3 (Hold) ranking on the Zacks Rank, and it's Most Accurate Estimate is $3.49 a share 77 days from its next quarterly update.For Cintas, the percentage difference between its Most Accurate Estimate and its Zacks Consensus Estimate of $3.48 is 0.12%.Story continuesBecause both stocks hold a positive Earnings ESP, SWK and CTAS could potentially post earnings beats in their next reports.Find Stocks to Buy or Sell Before They're ReportedUse the Zacks Earnings ESP Filter to turn up stocks with the highest probability of positively, or negatively, surprising to buy or sell before they're reported for profitable earnings season trading.

The stock's performance was ahead of the S&amp;P 500's daily gain of 0.81%. Meanwhile, the Dow gained 0.39%, and the Nasdaq, a tech-heavy index, added 1.35%.Shares of the maker of graphics chips for gaming and artificial intelligence have depreciated by 10.36% over the course of the past month, underperforming the Computer and Technology sector's loss of 6.4% and the S&amp;P 500's loss of 6.19%.Investors will be eagerly watching for the performance of Nvidia in its upcoming earnings disclosure. In that report, analysts expect Nvidia to post earnings of $3.32 per share. This would mark year-over-year growth of 472.41%. Meanwhile, our latest consensus estimate is calling for revenue of $16.04 billion, up 170.46% from the prior-year quarter.Looking at the full year, the Zacks Consensus Estimates suggest analysts are expecting earnings of $10.67 per share and revenue of $54.07 billion. These totals would mark changes of +219.46% and +100.44%, respectively, from last year.It's also important for investors to be aware of any recent modifications to analyst estimates for Nvidia. Such recent modifications usually signify the changing landscape of near-term business trends. Hence, positive alterations in estimates signify analyst optimism regarding the company's business and profitability.Our research demonstrates that these adjustments in estimates directly associate with imminent stock price performance. To benefit from this, we have developed the Zacks Rank, a proprietary model which takes these estimate changes into account and provides an actionable rating system.Ranging from #1 (Strong Buy) to #5 (Strong Sell), the Zacks Rank system has a proven, outside-audited track record of outperformance, with #1 stocks returning an average of +25% annually since 1988. The Zacks Consensus EPS estimate has moved 2.38% higher within the past month. Nvidia is holding a Zacks Rank of #1 (Strong Buy) right now.Story continuesValuation is also important, so investors should note that Nvidia has a Forward P/E ratio of 40.78 right now.

272,adfbbbf7-8000-31b6-af15-1a5ac363de1e,MCK,2023-10-05,Investing in McKesson (NYSE:MCK) five years ago would have delivered you a 235% gain,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/investing-mckesson-nyse-mck-five-125655666.html,1696424215,STORY,['MCK'],"[When you buy a stock there is always a possibility that it could drop 100%. But on a lighter note, a good company can see its share price rise well over 100%. One great example is McKesson Corporation (NYSE:MCK) which saw its share price drive 220% higher over five years. It's down 1.0% in the last seven days.So let's investigate and see if the longer term performance of the company has been in line with the underlying business' progress. View our latest analysis for McKesson To paraphrase Benjamin Graham: Over the short term the market is a voting machine, but over the long term it's a weighing machine. One imperfect but simple way to consider how the market perception of a company has shifted is to compare the change in the earnings per share (EPS) with the share price movement.During the five years of share price growth, McKesson moved from a loss to profitability. That kind of transition can be an inflection point that justifies a strong share price gain, just as we have seen here. Since the company was unprofitable five years ago, but not three years ago, it's worth taking a look at the returns in the last three years, too. We can see that the McKesson share price is up 200% in the last three years. In the same period, EPS is up 74% per year. This EPS growth is higher than the 44% average annual increase in the share price over the same three years. Therefore, it seems the market has moderated its expectations for growth, somewhat.The image below shows how EPS has tracked over time (if you click on the image you can see greater detail).earnings-per-share-growthWe know that McKesson has improved its bottom line over the last three years, but what does the future have in store? You can see how its balance sheet has strengthened (or weakened) over time in this free interactive graphic.What About Dividends?It is important to consider the total shareholder return, as well as the share price return, for any given stock. The TSR is a return calculation that accounts for the value of cash dividends (assuming that any dividend received was reinvested) and the calculated value of any discounted capital raisings and spin-offs. Arguably, the TSR gives a more comprehensive picture of the return generated by a stock. In the case of McKesson, it has a TSR of 235% for the last 5 years. That exceeds its share price return that we previously mentioned. The dividends paid by the company have thusly boosted the total shareholder return.Story continuesA Different PerspectiveIt's nice to see that McKesson shareholders have received a total shareholder return of 24% over the last year. And that does include the dividend. However, the TSR over five years, coming in at 27% per year, is even more impressive. While it is well worth considering the different impacts that market conditions can have on the share price, there are other factors that are even more important. Even so, be aware that  McKesson is showing  1 warning sign in our investment analysis , you should know about...We will like McKesson better if we see some big insider buys.

Children's (aged three to nine years) theme park tickets and dining plans will be half off with the purchase of a non-discounted four-night, four-day Walt Disney Travel Co. package. This package includes a room at a selected Disney Resort hotel, theme park tickets and a dining plan. The offer is valid for stays from Mar 3 to Jun 30, 2024.Starting from Jan 9, 2024, theme park reservations will no longer be required for standard and date-based tickets.

Lightning Lane entrances can be purchased either as part of Disney Genie+ service or individually.Dining plans will be available starting from Jan 9, 2024. These plans offer convenience and peace of mind for guests staying at Disney Resort hotels.

The division's 13% increase in revenues during the third quarter and its consistent growth over the past few quarters are noteworthy.The company has touted that this segment has expanded at a combined annual growth rate of 6% since 2017 and generated $32.3 billion in operating income over the last 12 months.Disney's plans to nearly double its investment in the Parks division, with a $60 billion investment over the next 10 years, show a strong commitment to further developing this part of its business.For the current quarter, this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company estimates revenues between $21.15 billion and $21.53 billion. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Story continuesThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for fourth-quarter fiscal 2023 is pegged at $21.34 billion, indicating year-over-year growth of 5.89%. The consensus estimate for earnings has declined by a couple of cents over the past 30 days to 76 cents per share.Disney is working on updates to existing hotel and resort locations. These updates could involve improvements, renovations, or new theming to enhance the guest experience. Projects, already in motion, include redesigning Splash Mountain at both domestic resorts with a Princess and the Frog theme, as well as updates to existing hotel and resort locations.DIS is set to nearly double the capacity of its cruise line by adding two ships in fiscal 2025 and another in 2026. This expansion aims to meet the growing demand for Disney cruise vacations.Disney unveiled some exciting ""blue sky"" ideas for its parks during the D23 Expo. These projects are still in early development and may or may not come to fruition. Some ideas include revamping Dino Land at Animal Kingdom in Orlando with a Zootopia or Moana theme.The company is exploring new possibilities at Magic Kingdom Park around Disney villains which could provide an exciting contrast to the usual Disney theme of heroes and princesses.These plans and ideas demonstrate Disney's commitment to continuously evolving and expanding its parks and resorts to boost segment revenues by providing magical experiences for guests.However, DIS has suffered from the underwhelming performance of its streaming business, Disney+ and the disappointing theatrical presentation of Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantum Mania and Elemental.Disney shares have underperformed its closest peers like Netflix NFLX, Amazon AMZN and Comcast CMCSA. Shares of Netflix, Amazon and Comcast returned 46.8%, 70.2% and 28.6%, respectively.Stiff competition from Comcast in the theme park business is hurting DIS’ prospects. CMCSA is set to launch Epic Universe opening in the summer of 2025 which will bring the popular Super Nintendo World to Florida while also adding another Wizarding World of Harry Potter land to the company's lineup.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

The report noted that this is the best three-day viewership total in the franchise since an episode of The Bachelorette in 2020.Yahoo Finance's Alexandra Canal, Madison Mills, and Josh Schafer discuss the new series. For more expert insight and the latest market action, click here to watch this full episode of Yahoo Finance Live.Video TranscriptALEXANDRA CANAL: I also like to spend my time watching TV and so do a lot of other Americans because ABC'S ""The Golden Bachelor"" hit a new three-year high for the entire franchise. So this includes ""The Bachelor,"" ""Bachelorette,"" ""Bachelor in Paradise."" So the numbers here, guys, really speak for themselves.In the three days after the premiere, viewership rose to 7.7 million of cross-platform viewing. So that includes streaming, a gain of 3.34 million viewers on streaming, which is almost 77% over its on-air total of 4.36 million. The episode also more than tripled its 18 to 49 rating and was the best three-day total for any installment of the franchise since an episode of ""The Bachelorette"" in November of 2020.And there's that question of whether this is sustainable. Obviously, ""The Golden Bachelor,"" it's a new iteration of ""The Bachelor,"" older cast. There was certainly an allure, a curiosity of how they were going to lay this out, if it was going to be more wholesome, if we weren't going to have as much of the drama that we're normally used to with this franchise.And then of course, within the context of the ongoing actor strike in Hollywood, they're currently in negotiations. We just saw the writers strike. And we haven't had a ton of scripted programming out there, not a ton of new stuff at least.So reality TV really one of the big benefits from-- you know, that can benefit from the double work stoppage that we saw.

I meant to-- no, I wanted to watch an episode.ALEXANDRA CANAL: I've seen clips.

I don't think it's going to have staying power.MADISON MILLS: I just think, Josh, there's so many examples of this reality TV group for people who haven't necessarily always been featured on TV doing really well. I think about ""Queer Ultimatum"" on Netflix, ""Golden Bachelor"" having these incredible numbers, it tells me that there's a market for it. It reminds me of the NFL reaching out to women thing.JOSH SCHAFER: Sure.MADISON MILLS: There's a market for the new consumer that maybe hasn't always been featured.JOSH SCHAFER: Do you think people are sick of the drama of the normal ""Bachelor"" and ""Bachelorette?"" And if this isn't-- because I don't think it's going to be that drama filled. I don't think that's--ALEXANDRA CANAL: They can't. They can't have the little grandmas and grandpas fighting--JOSH SCHAFER: --like you said, so if it is more if it is more wholesome, do you think, like, even the normal ""Bachelor"" consumer is, kind of, ready for that? I could see that, right?ALEXANDRA CANAL: Yes. Especially in this age of social media--JOSH SCHAFER: The fighting's gotten a little ridiculous.ALEXANDRA CANAL: --everyone knows people want to be influencers and people want to be this and that. And we haven't seen a ton of great success rates either for these couples. So I think this is a new refresh of sorts. And what you were saying about bringing in a new demographic to the reality TV space. I also think about the people that watch cable television, it's older people.MADISON MILLS: Yeah.JOSH SCHAFER: Sure.ALEXANDRA CANAL: So in terms of perhaps boosting linear up a little bit, this could be a good opportunity as well. Although we are seeing the streaming side doing well.JOSH SCHAFER: Interesting.ALEXANDRA CANAL: Yeah.JOSH SCHAFER: If I were ABC, I'd probably want younger people to start watching my network though--ALEXANDRA CANAL: That's fair.JOSH SCHAFER: --given all the things going on there.ALEXANDRA CANAL: Yeah, well, Bob Iger is looking to sell it at some point anyway.JOSH SCHAFER: Maybe they'll have a new version of ""The Bachelor"" with some other something else coming up, right?

Some analysts, though were saying, well, it could also be the prices.JULIE HYMAN: The company did see a 13% increase in its parks revenue last quarter. It has been a strong area for them. So that's why it was so interesting to hear these reports that attendance might be seeing a little bit of an issue. So it's interesting.Investors don't seem to be paying that much attention to it today, with the stock only off a half a percent. So it's not necessarily being seen as a serious signal that demand is weakening, and they're trying desperately to get more people in. But it is an interesting thing to continue to watch.

283,08d9ca9d-7bcd-3294-8a66-e1b8949d8bb4,EXC,2023-10-05,Don’t Miss the Boom: 7 Utilities Stocks Set to Explode Higher,InvestorPlace,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/don-t-miss-boom-7-002709181.html,1695947229,STORY,"['EXC', 'NIMC', 'PCG', 'NEE', 'SRE', 'DUK-PA']","[Amid a still-stubbornly high backdrop of inflation, the narrative for utilities stocks to buy stands as a cynical bright spot. Basically, everyone must pay their bills associated with core services. Otherwise, no pay, no play.Fundamentally, utilities stocks benefit from a natural monopoly. Legally speaking, an enterprise could potentially compete with a utility powerhouse. However, the barriers to entry – from the costs involved and the regulatory hoops – prevent would-be rivals from even trying. Therefore, these established giants can almost do whatever they want.Second, there’s no trade-down effect involved with utilities stocks because it’s a binary proposition. Unless you go off the grid completely, you either have the critical service or you don’t. Therefore, folks pay up because they have no choice, which bodes well for the below entities.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsDuke Energy (DUK)The logo for Duke Energy (DUK) is seen on a sign at one of the company's offices.Source: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.comA seemingly top-tier idea among utilities stocks to buy, Duke Energy (NYSE:DUK) theoretically should be performing a lot better than it has. An electric power and natural gas holding firm, Duke provides coverage to compelling regions, such as the Carolinas. With millennials increasingly moving to these places on or near the eastern coastline, Duke operates where the money is going.However, since the January opener, shares have slipped more than 13%. In the trailing one-year period, DUK lost almost 10%, which doesn’t seem congruent with its relevance. However, a look at Fintel’s options flow screener – which targets big block trades likely made by institutions – presents an encouraging canvas.While options trades in September have been decidedly bearish, the most recent transaction provides hope. Basically, a major trader (or traders) sold 10,000 contracts of the Nov 17 ’23 85.00 Put, collecting a $1.06 million premium in the process. In my opinion, that seems aggressively bullish. Also, analysts peg DUK as a moderate buy with a $99.75 target, implying nearly 11% upside potential.Story continuesExelon (EXC)The logo for Exelon (EXC) is visible at the top of an office building.Source: photosounds / Shutterstock.comHeadquartered in Chicago, Illinois, Exelon (NASDAQ:EXC) is the largest electric parent company in the U.S. by revenue, per its public profile. Given its massive footprint, one might expect EXC to perform well. However, the opposite is true. Since the beginning of this year, EXC has fallen a bit over 10%. In the past 365 days, shares have gone nowhere, dipping 2%.Adding to the worries, major options traders in this case seem bearish on Exelon. For example, on Sept. 26, a trader bought 672 contracts of the Nov 17 ’23 36.00 Put, paying a premium of nearly $27,000. On Aug. 22, a trader (or several traders) sold 2,708 contracts of the Oct 20 ’23 42.00 Put, collecting a premium of $144,716.However, the risk for the shorts is that all it takes is a rotation away from speculation and toward more reliable entities. You can’t get much more reliable than massive utilities stocks to buy. If you want to go contrarian, analysts rate EXC a strong buy with a $44.44 price target, implying 15% upside.PG&amp;E (PCG)Numerous electric lines are seen at sunset.Source: Pand P Studio / Shutterstock.comOne of the top utilities stocks, PG&amp;E (NYSE:PCG) provides electricity and natural gas service to much of Northern and Central California. Right there, PG&amp;E deserves a look for its massive relevance. Love it or hate it, the Golden State represents the economic engine of the U.S. Without California, our nation wouldn’t quite be the massive superpower that it is.Sure enough, investors seem to recognize this overwhelming catalyst. Since the start of the year, PCG gained just under 5%. That’s nothing to write home about but relatively speaking, that’s a decent run. Still, investors should be aware of some storms brewing in the derivatives market. Specifically, a major trader sold 2,601 contracts of the Nov 17 ’23 17.00 Call, collecting a $158,539 premium.While that’s distracting, keep in mind that PCG stock closed recently at $16.44. All it needs is an understanding that investors may prefer risk-off assets as opposed to risk-on. Thus, it’s possible that PCG can swing higher, blowing up this apparently bearish trade. Oh yeah, analysts rate shares a strong buy with a $19.33 price target.Sempra Energy (SRE)The logo for Sempra (SRE) is seen at the top of an office building.Source: Michael Vi / Shutterstock.comWhile Sempra Energy (NYSE:SRE) as a business doesn’t get much love from its users, it does plenty to earn the respect of shareholders. Actually, I’m not sure if that’s true in the active sense. Rather, Sempra benefits passively by covering segments of the extremely lucrative Southern California market. As stated earlier with PG&amp;E, California represents an economic powerhouse just by itself. So, SRE is one of the utilities stocks to buy.In fairness, though, it doesn’t seem that way. Since the January opener, SRE slipped almost 10%. In the past 365 days, the security gave up nearly 12% of its equity value. And sure enough, institutional traders seem pessimistic about SRE. For example, an entity sold 1,901 contracts of the Nov 17 ’23 75.00 Call on Sept. 21, collecting a nearly $230,000 premium.With SRE down at $69.41 recently, that might seem like a good trade. But Sempra’s consistent profitability could move the needle to the upside, blowing up this bear trade. Lastly, analysts peg shares as a moderate buy with an $82.15 price target, implying over 18% upside.NiSource (NI)Image of a gas burner with a blue flameSource: ShutterstockA concocting mix between speculation and opportunity, NiSource (NYSE:NI) is one of the largest fully regulated utilities stocks in the U.S. Per its public profile, NiSource services approximately 3.5 million natural gas customers and half a million electric customers across six states. That seems powerfully relevant. Unfortunately, NI shares have fallen more than 8% since the January opener.In the past 365 days, NI dipped 7.5%. And in the trailing five years, shares only gained 1%, reflecting how many investors turned to risk-on assets. Adding to the concerns for NI, major traders have been bearish. For instance, on Sept. 27, an entity (or entities) bought 6,099 contracts of the Oct 20 ’23 25.00 Put, paying a premium of $202,500.With shares trading hands at $25.18 recently, it seems this put will go in the money (ITM). However, implied volatility (IV) runs higher on the far out-the-money (OTM) calls than the OTM puts. In other words, I see a clear risk to the bears that investors will rotate toward more reliable ideas. Finally, analysts rate NI a unanimous strong buy with a $30.80 price target.American Electric Power (AEP)the American Electric Power logo is magnified on a websiteSource: Casimiro PT / Shutterstock.comA major investor-owned electric utility in the U.S., American Electric Power (NASDAQ:AEP) delivers electricity to more than five million customers in 11 states, according to its corporate profile. Also, AEP ranks among the nation’s largest generators of electricity, owning nearly 38,000 megawatts of generating capacity. Sadly, investors don’t seem to care right now.Since the January opener, AEP fell 20%. In the trailing one-year period, AEP gave up about 19% of its equity value. Since the spring doldrums of 2020, AEP has gyrated wildly across the map. In addition, the volatile swings have attracted bearish attention. Looking at Fintel’s options flow screener, the latest major transaction (Sept. 21) involved the selling of 1,000 contracts of the Oct 20 ’23 82.50 Call.Overall, the net profile seems bearish on AEP. However, it appears that the institutional options trades will expire on Oct. 20. It’s possible that without this overhang beginning the following Monday, AEP might move higher. It’s speculation, of course. Still, AEP carries a strong buy rating with a $93.38 target, implying over 23% upside potential.NextEra Energy (NEE)Environmental protection, renewable, sustainable energy sources. Plant growing in the bulb concept. renewable energy stocks to buySource: Proxima Studio / Shutterstock.comOn paper, NextEra Energy (NYSE:NEE) seems a shoo-in for utilities stocks to buy. One of the most popular companies given its focus on renewable energy, NextEra commands about 58 gigawatts (GW) of generating capacity. Per its public profile, the company is the largest electric utility holding company by market capitalization. Sadly, it’s not really looking too special in the charts.Since the start of the year, NEE fell more than 28%. Conspicuously, the security gave up nearly 12% of its equity value just in the past one-month period. And even with the decline in market value, NEE trades at a forward earnings multiple of 17.65x. That’s above the sector median of 13.94x, thus ranking worse than 82.48% of the competition.Interestingly, a major trader appears to have bought 4,110 contracts of the Jan 19 ’24 80.00 Put, paying a premium of $3.65 million. This premium represents 10.86 standard deviations above the mean, which is worrying. Still, if NEE bounces back, it could hurt the bears. Interestingly, analysts rate NEE a strong buy with an average price target of $85.46.On the date of publication, Josh Enomoto did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.A former senior business analyst for Sony Electronics, Josh Enomoto has helped broker major contracts with Fortune Global 500 companies.

WTI traded as high as $84.30 earlier in the session before hitting an intraday bottom of $82.28, its lowest in five weeks.“With WTI failing to find buyers at $84, the decline can extend to $81,” said Sunil Kumar Dixit, a technical chartist for oil at SKCharting.com.London-traded Brent for the most-active December contract settled down $1.74, or 2%, at $84.07. From an intraday high of $86.50, the global crude benchmark went to a five-week low of $83.84.Part of the selloff in crude was due to the broad run-up since July in the dollar and US Treasury yields which had weighed on the international demand for oil denominated in the US currency.“This oil market reversal must be frustrating the Saudis,” said Ed Moya, analyst at online trading platform OANDA. “Brent crude has fallen over $10 since the end of last month as surging global bond yields have crippled the global growth outlook.""“Energy stocks have gone from Wall Street's best trade to it is time to abandon ship. US gasoline demand destruction is intensifying and given how overbought the energy market was in September, momentum oil selling has been fierce.”Huge US gasoline stockpiles defy oil demand narrativeUS gasoline stockpiles jumped by 6.481 million barrels last week, adding to the prior week’s growth of 1.027M. It was the single largest weekly build in gasoline since January 2022. Analysts tracked by Investing.com had anticipated a drop of 0.3M barrels instead last week for gasoline, America’s foremost fuel product..Story continuesAlso weighing on crude prices was talk that global oil production could grow in coming months despite OPEC’s best efforts to fence in output, said Stephen Innes of SPI Asset Management.""Demand destruction always plays a crucial role in eventually easing price pressures,” Innes said. “Increasing chatter about more non-OPEC supply coming to market is not working in the bull market's favor this week,”OPEC+ is made up of the 13-member Saudi-led Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and the 10 independent oil producers, including Russia. At Wednesday’s meeting, the alliance reaffirmed the joint Saudi-Russian pledge to continue removing at least 1.3 million barrels a day from the combined daily production of the two countries until the end of the year.But OPEC+ did not talk about extending those cuts into 2024, something the oil trade had come to expect after Saudi Arabia had created the impression in recent months that it can continue surprising the world with one production squeeze after another.“Oil markets didn't like that,” Innes said, referring to the absence of a new announcement on cuts.Back in August, the Saudi Press Agency first communicated to the market that production cuts could be prolonged and deepened, keeping up with the aspirations of the nation’s energy minister Abdul Aziz bin Salman, who has branded himself as the oil market's “Dirty Harry” — the Hollywood maverick cop known for playing by his own rules with both criminals and his superiors.While crude prices had gained almost 30% in the third quarter, some of the minister's handiwork was being undone now. This week alone, WTI was down 9% and Brent almost 12%, with many analysts admitting they had no idea how long the selloff could last.“When oil prices tank, it is hard to estimate where prices could find support,” Moya said.He didn’t rule out the possibility of the Saudis, who practically control every aspect of OPEC, in trying to return to their game of one-upmanship.“Further bearishness could also trigger further output cuts by OPEC+,” said Moya. “OPEC+ worked hard to get oil back to $90 a barrel and they will likely continue to do whatever it takes to make sure we don’t see prices return to the lows of the year, which is around the $70 level.”(Peter Nurse contributed to this item)Related ArticlesOil down another 2% as non-stop rally turns into non-stop selloff Oil prices extend rapid slide on demand worriesNatural gas hits 9-month high extending $3 pricing on smallish storage build]"

The plunge came after a rally that began in June, founded more on OPEC production maneuvers designed to create maximum fear about short supply than demand sustained by global economic soundness. Crude prices ultimately rose almost 30% for the third quarter.On Wednesday, the floor under that rally gave way like it hadn’t before in those three months.New York-traded West Texas Intermediate, or WTI, crude for delivery in November traded settled down $5.01, or 5.6%, at $84.22 per barrel. The US crude benchmark hit a one-month low of $84.17 earlier and was down 7% on the week.“If WTI at $84 doesn’t attract buyers, the decline can extend to $81,” said Sunil Kumar Dixit, chief technical strategist at SKCharting.com.As WTI settled, London-traded Brent for the most-active December contract was down $5.11, or 5.6%, to $85.91 by 14:30 ET (18:30 GMT), after a one-month low at $85.77. The global crude benchmark was down 10% on the week.Wednesday’s collapse in oil prices came amid several drivers.The primary one was concern about the health of the global economy, particularly Europe’s most vulnerable versus the relatively resilient US economy.But the United States has its own problems too with the energy-price driven inflation of the past three months prodding the Federal Reserve to stay hawkish on interest rates for the foreseeable future. That has pushed the dollar to 11-month highs, further weakening the finances of other nations and international demand for crude and other commodities denominated in the US currency.OPEC show ""hijacked"" by economy, US inventory dataThe other driver for Wednesday’s spectacular price drop in crude was the seasonal slide in U.S. demand — a fact that seemed lost on those betting on the oil rally of the past quarter to continue indefinitely on OPEC market manipulation and promises.Story continues“Today’s oil prices, if anything, show how insanely bulls have been pushing this market up for months, oblivious to the fact that there’s something greater than OPEC — the economy, you know,” said John Kilduff, partner at New York energy hedge fund Again Capital.OPEC and its allies at a meeting on Wednesday reaffirmed the joint Saudi-Russian pledge to continue removing a total of at least 1.3 million barrels a day from the daily production of the two countries until the end of the year.The so-called OPEC+ alliance — made up of the 13-member Saudi-led Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and the 10 independent oil producers aligned to Russia — however, saw its much-hyped show hijacked by the events in global markets and by an inventory report released by the U.S. government.US stockpiles of gasoline jumped almost 6.5 million barrels last week, the biggest build in nearly two years, a government report showed on Wednesday, as refiners optimized processing of oil to capitalize on still-good profit margins despite waning seasonal demand for fuels.Inventories of crude oil, meanwhile, fell by just a third during the week ended Sept 29 -- amid the first rise in two months in volumes at the Cushing, Oklahoma hub that serves as a central delivery and storage point for U.S. crude, according to the Weekly Petroleum Status Report of the U.S. Energy Information Administration, or EIA.Crude inventories overall fell by 2.224M barrels last week, registering a third straight week of draws that kept up with the prior week’s drop of 2.17M. Analysts tracked by Investing.com, on the other hand, did not really expect a change in overall crude inventories last week, forecasting a negligible build of 0.05M.Despite the draw reported for the headline crude number by the EIA, crude volumes at Cushing rose last week for the first time in eight weeks, showing a modest gain of 0.132M versus the previous week’s slide of 0.943M.The build at Cushing is significant for several reasons. For weeks now, traders had been fearful that Cushing inventories would fall to critically low levels that would complicate operations at the storage hub. The hub had seen enormous outflows of crude this year versus inflows, partly because of the pickup in export demand for a heavier type of US crude called West Texas Intermediate Midland, which people in the trade say is somewhat comparable to the viscosity of Saudi and Russian oils.Shipments of US crude reached record highs of more than 5 million barrels per day in recent weeks, boosted by demand for the so-called WTI Midland which made inroads into markets underserved by production cuts in Saudi and Russian crude. Last week, for instance, US crude exports were at 4.96M barrels, up from the prior week’s 4.012M.The build in Cushing despite such high demand for US crude proved there were finally more inflows at the hub than outflows despite the number of actively-deployed domestic oil drilling rigs falling almost non-stop since the start of this year. Despite the drop in oil rigs, the EIA continued to project a daily production of 12.9M barrels for US crude last week.But more than the overall US crude draw and the build at Cushing, the staggering number in the latest weekly EIA inventory report was the build for gasoline stockpiles, which went up by 6.481M barrels last week, adding to the prior week’s growth of 1.027M. It was the single largest weekly build in gasoline since January 2022. Analysts tracked by Investing.com had anticipated a drop of 0.3M barrels instead last week for gasoline, America’s foremost fuel product..While gasoline inventories rose, stockpiles of distillate — a feedstock for diesel and heating fuel — fell by 1.269M barrels last week, after a build of 0.398M in the week prior. Analysts tracked by Investing.com had forecast a 0.068M drop for last week.The changes in gasoline and distillate inventories came amid healthy refining profit margins, known as “cracks”, seen for both now, particularly in distillates.Typically at this time of year, demand for fuels is softer in the United States as fewer families do trip roads with children back in school or college. Yet, refiners seem to be cranking out as much gasoline and diesel as they could, incentivized by the cracks. The EIA said last week's total refined oil product supply to the marketplace -- an indicator of demand -- fell to 8.014M for gasoline versus the prior week's 8.619M.The EIA said refiners actually turned out less gasoline and other fuel products last week compared with the week prior.

CAG is likely to register top-and-bottom-line growth when it reports first-quarter fiscal 2024 earnings on Oct 5. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues is pegged at roughly $3 billion, suggesting a rise of 1.4% from the prior-year quarter’s reported figure.The consensus mark for quarterly earnings has remained unchanged in the past 30 days at 60 cents per share, implying growth of 5.3% from the year-ago quarter’s reported figure. Conagra Brands has a trailing four-quarter earnings surprise of 13.6%, on average.Factors to NoteConagra has been gaining from its frozen and snacks categories. On its fourth-quarter fiscal 2023 earnings call, management stated that the frozen and snacks categories improved 9% and 8%, respectively, over the past four years. Together, these categories form about 70% of the company’s domestic retail dollar sales.Growth in the frozen category reflects the strength of CAG’s brands and the effective execution of the Conagra Way playbook. In fiscal 2023 (a year of considerable pricing), seven out of the company’s top 10 frozen product categories either held or increased unit share. Moving to snacks, Conagra’s two biggest snacking platforms — meat snacks and microwave popcorn — witnessed increased unit share in fiscal 2023. Management expects fiscal 2024 results to benefit from the company’s investments in innovation in these categories. This bodes well for the quarter under review.Conagra’s efficient pricing initiatives have been another driver, offering respite amid cost headwinds. Incidentally, the company has been encountering cost inflation for a while now, though pressure has been easing of late, with inflation-justified pricing actions being a major help. Management expects the net cost of goods sold inflation of nearly 3% in fiscal 2024. It also expects increased investments in A&amp;P as well as SG&amp;A in fiscal 2024 to facilitate innovation.While these costs raise concerns over margins, pricing actions and brand strength are likely to aid results in the quarter to be reported. Our model suggests a pricing gain of 8.8% in the first quarter of fiscal 2024.

Analysts tracked by Investing.com, on the other hand, did not really expect a change in overall crude inventories last week, forecasting a negligible build of 0.05M.Despite the draw reported for the headline crude number by the EIA, crude volumes at Cushing rose last week for the first time in eight weeks, showing a modest gain of 0.132M versus the previous week’s slide of 0.943M.The build at Cushing is significant for several reasons. For weeks now, traders had been fearful that Cushing inventories would fall to critically low levels that would complicate operations at the storage hub. The hub had seen enormous outflows of crude this year versus inflows, partly because of the pickup in export demand for a heavier type of US crude called West Texas Intermediate Midland, which people in the trade say is somewhat comparable to the viscosity of Saudi and Russian oils.Shipments of US crude reached record highs of more than 5 million barrels per day in recent weeks, boosted by demand for the so-called WTI Midland which made inroads into markets underserved by production cuts in Saudi and Russian crude.

However, the study also found that educators lack centralized resources and direct support necessary to successfully overcome barriers to the digital divide. Released to help support this year’s Digital Inclusion Week theme of ""Building Connected Communities,"" key findings include:This press release features multimedia. View the full release here: https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20231003999991/en/New Discovery Education and Comcast Study Highlights Opportunity for United States Schools to Help Students Overcome Digital Divide (Photo: Business Wire)Nearly all educators surveyed feel strongly that digital equity is more important today than ever before.82% of families and 80% of educators surveyed feel strongly that high-speed Internet at home is extremely important to fulfilling learning outcomes.While two-thirds of families and educators acknowledge their school’s interest in closing the digital divide, only one-third are aware of actionable measures being taken by the school district.Only 39% of parents were aware of the ACP, and of those that were aware, just 13% of parents have signed up. What’s more, only 22% of educators surveyed strongly agree that administrators in their school districts are equipped with the necessary information to communicate options for high-speed internet access at home.Data shows multiple disconnects between what parents pointed to as actual barriers to broadband adoption versus what teachers perceived as parents’ barriers to adoption. Addressing these will be critical to ensuring that school districts and digital navigator programs are effective in closing the digital divide for students.There was a 52-percentage-point difference between the share of teachers who thought that cost of service was the primary barrier to adoption for families versus the actual share of parents who pointed to cost as a barrier.Significantly larger shares of teachers thought that families did not live in buildings that were wired for broadband, did not know how to set up the Internet, and did not have devices than the share of parents who raised these barriers.Findings from the study also support a recommendation for school systems to partner with proven and trusted programs such as those that include support from Digital Navigators — to help streamline communication, advocacy, and adoption strategies that lead to equitable opportunities for all students. Ensuring all ACP-eligible families are signed up is equally important in supporting district connectivity goals.Story continuesTo help further address these issues, Comcast is helping school administrators more quickly and easily access additional resources to get more households enrolled in the ACP during the back-to-school season through the Online For All Back to School Challenge, led by the U.S. Department of Education and Civic Nation.A new online tool from Comcast is designed to help administrators quickly and easily assess ACP eligibility in their school districts. They can also learn about which schools have the lowest broadband adoption rates in their area. This valuable data will enable school leaders to better tailor communications around the ACP and direct families to resources that can assist in supporting Internet adoption.""Ensuring every student in America has access to reliable, high-speed Internet in the classroom and at home is a top priority for Comcast’s Project UP. The combination of historic investments in universal broadband, public-private collaboration, and private industry support will together ensure that neither availability nor affordability stand in the way of achieving connectivity for everyone,"" said Broderick Johnson, EVP of Public Policy and EVP of Digital Equity, Comcast Corporation.""At Discovery Education, we are on a mission to prepare learners for tomorrow by creating innovative classrooms connected to today’s world. Today, no matter where learning takes place, access to and adoption of high-speed Internet is an essential ingredient for student success. As Comcast's education partner in this work, we’re proud to support efforts to ensure students and families have the tools necessary to meet the demands of the modern learning environment,"" said Amy Nakamoto, EVP of Social Impact, Discovery Education.""Today, 17 million unconnected households are eligible for low-cost, high-speed Internet under the Affordable Connectivity Program. Civic Nation is partnering with the U.S. Department of Education, school districts, and organizations across the country through Online For All to close this gap and ensure every student and family has equitable access to learning, both at home and in the classroom,"" said Kyle Lierman, CEO of Civic Nation.Additional key findings from the study include:While educators believe their school district leaders are aware of the negative impacts the digital divide has on learning outcomes, there are numerous other factors being prioritized over home Internet adoption.86% of educators surveyed elevated student well-being as the most important issue for schools to address, followed by school safety, and equity and inclusion more broadly. This places more emphasis on policymakers, school officials, institutions, and the private sector to show how digital equity and home broadband adoption facilitate broader equity issues and level the playing field for families seeking opportunities for their children.Further, coupling Internet access and adoption with an ability to address other school concerns, such as providing supports for student well-being and growth, has the ability to keep digital equity as a top priority for school leaders and help them serve broader needs for their students.There is widespread agreement that the pandemic forcefully evolved and rapidly closed gaps in the digital divide as schools moved swiftly to remote learning. This cultural shift was met with success stories of connectivity and technological advancements, but also shined a light on students and families who did not experience equitable access to learning because of lack of connectivity or devices, or other barriers that made remote learning cumbersome.This study and partnerships were made possible by Project UP, Comcast’s comprehensive initiative to advance digital equity and help build a future of unlimited possibilities. Part of Comcast’s $1 billion commitment is prioritizing Internet connectivity and its impact on education. In addition, through providing low-cost broadband through Internet Essentials to families and the Internet Essentials Partner Program (IEPP) for schools, Comcast continues to ensure there are no barriers to home connectivity that could impede learning.To review a full copy of the study, please click here.About Comcast CorporationComcast Corporation (Nasdaq: CMCSA) is a global media and technology company.

295,47bdf808-b91e-3f64-9e04-969e116b27cd,PRU,2023-10-05,"Based On Its ROE, Is Prudential Financial, Inc. (NYSE:PRU) A High Quality Stock?",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/based-roe-prudential-financial-inc-140035406.html,1696428035,STORY,['PRU'],"[Many investors are still learning about the various metrics that can be useful when analysing a stock. This article is for those who would like to learn about Return On Equity (ROE). By way of learning-by-doing, we'll look at ROE to gain a better understanding of Prudential Financial, Inc. (NYSE:PRU).Return on Equity or ROE is a test of how effectively a company is growing its value and managing investors’ money. In short, ROE shows the profit each dollar generates with respect to its shareholder investments. See our latest analysis for Prudential Financial How To Calculate Return On Equity?Return on equity can be calculated by using the formula:Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' EquitySo, based on the above formula, the ROE for Prudential Financial is:6.9% = US$2.0b ÷ US$29b (Based on the trailing twelve months to June 2023).The 'return' is the amount earned after tax over the last twelve months. So, this means that for every $1 of its shareholder's investments, the company generates a profit of $0.07.Does Prudential Financial Have A Good ROE?By comparing a company's ROE with its industry average, we can get a quick measure of how good it is. However, this method is only useful as a rough check, because companies do differ quite a bit within the same industry classification. As is clear from the image below, Prudential Financial has a lower ROE than the average (11%) in the Insurance industry.roeUnfortunately, that's sub-optimal. However, a low ROE is not always bad. If the company's debt levels are moderate to low, then there's still a chance that returns can be improved via the use of financial leverage. A high debt company having a low ROE is a different story altogether and a risky investment in our books.The Importance Of Debt To Return On EquityMost companies need money -- from somewhere -- to grow their profits. That cash can come from retained earnings, issuing new shares (equity), or debt. In the first two cases, the ROE will capture this use of capital to grow. In the latter case, the use of debt will improve the returns, but will not change the equity. In this manner the use of debt will boost ROE, even though the core economics of the business stay the same.Story continuesPrudential Financial's Debt And Its 6.9% ROEIt's worth noting the high use of debt by Prudential Financial, leading to its debt to equity ratio of 1.06. Its ROE is quite low, even with the use of significant debt; that's not a good result, in our opinion. Debt increases risk and reduces options for the company in the future, so you generally want to see some good returns from using it.SummaryReturn on equity is one way we can compare its business quality of different companies. In our books, the highest quality companies have high return on equity, despite low debt. If two companies have around the same level of debt to equity, and one has a higher ROE, I'd generally prefer the one with higher ROE.But ROE is just one piece of a bigger puzzle, since high quality businesses often trade on high multiples of earnings. The rate at which profits are likely to grow, relative to the expectations of profit growth reflected in the current price, must be considered, too.

When compared to the GF Value of $52.09, the stock appears to be modestly undervalued. The following is the income breakdown of Devon Energy:Unveiling Devon Energy (DVN)'s Value: Is It Really Priced Right? A Comprehensive GuideUnderstanding GF ValueThe GF Value is a unique measure that provides an estimation of a stock's intrinsic value. It is calculated based on historical multiples, a GuruFocus adjustment factor based on the company's past returns and growth, and future estimates of the business performance. The GF Value Line on our summary page gives an overview of the fair value that the stock should be traded at.According to the GF Value, Devon Energy (NYSE:DVN) appears to be modestly undervalued. The stock's fair value is estimated based on historical multiples, an internal adjustment based on the company's past business growth, and analyst estimates of future business performance. If the stock's share price is significantly above the GF Value Line, the stock may be overvalued and have poor future returns. Conversely, if the stock's share price is significantly below the GF Value Line, the stock may be undervalued and have high future returns.Story continuesGiven that Devon Energy is relatively undervalued, the long-term return of its stock is likely to be higher than its business growth.Unveiling Devon Energy (DVN)'s Value: Is It Really Priced Right? A Comprehensive GuideLink: These companies may deliver higher future returns at reduced risk.Evaluating Financial StrengthInvesting in companies with low financial strength could result in permanent capital loss. Therefore, it's crucial to review a company's financial strength before deciding whether to buy shares. A good initial perspective on the company's financial strength can be gained by looking at the cash-to-debt ratio and interest coverage. Devon Energy has a cash-to-debt ratio of 0.07, which ranks worse than 83.63% of 1026 companies in the Oil &amp; Gas industry. Based on this, GuruFocus ranks Devon Energy's financial strength as 6 out of 10, suggesting a fair balance sheet.This is the debt and cash of Devon Energy over the past years:Unveiling Devon Energy (DVN)'s Value: Is It Really Priced Right? A Comprehensive GuideProfitability and GrowthInvesting in profitable companies, especially those with consistent profitability over the long term, is typically less risky. A company with high profit margins is usually a safer investment than those with low profit margins. Devon Energy has been profitable 5 over the past 10 years. Over the past twelve months, the company had a revenue of $17 billion and Earnings Per Share (EPS) of $7.31. Its operating margin is 37.06%, which ranks better than 80.49% of 979 companies in the Oil &amp; Gas industry. Overall, the profitability of Devon Energy is ranked 6 out of 10, indicating fair profitability.Growth is probably the most important factor in the valuation of a company.

The 3-year average EBITDA growth rate is 56.9%, which ranks better than 86.68% of 826 companies in the Oil &amp; Gas industry.ROIC vs WACCAnother way to assess a company's profitability is to compare its return on invested capital (ROIC) and the weighted cost of capital (WACC). Return on invested capital (ROIC) measures how well a company generates cash flow relative to the capital it has invested in its business. The weighted average cost of capital (WACC) is the rate that a company is expected to pay on average to all its security holders to finance its assets. Ideally, the return on invested capital should be higher than the weighted cost of capital. For the past 12 months, Devon Energy's return on invested capital is 24.3, and its cost of capital is 11.96.The historical ROIC vs WACC comparison of Devon Energy is shown below:Unveiling Devon Energy (DVN)'s Value: Is It Really Priced Right?

298,85a65571-5316-33fb-8b59-1b78e30fd54b,ORCL,2023-10-05,Oracle Corporation (ORCL) is Attracting Investor Attention: Here is What You Should Know,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/oracle-corporation-orcl-attracting-investor-130010202.html,1696424410,STORY,['ORCL'],"[Oracle (ORCL) has recently been on Zacks.com's list of the most searched stocks. Therefore, you might want to consider some of the key factors that could influence the stock's performance in the near future.Over the past month, shares of this software maker have returned -15.7%, compared to the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's -6.2% change. During this period, the Zacks Computer - Software industry, which Oracle falls in, has lost 6.4%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?While media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.Earnings Estimate RevisionsRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.We essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.Oracle is expected to post earnings of $1.32 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +9.1%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -1.8%.The consensus earnings estimate of $5.54 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of +8.2%. This estimate has changed +0.1% over the last 30 days.Story continuesFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $6.12 indicates a change of +10.5% from what Oracle is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -0.5%.Having a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, Oracle is rated Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPSProjected Revenue GrowthWhile earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.For Oracle, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $13.05 billion indicates a year-over-year change of +6.3%. For the current and next fiscal years, $53.56 billion and $57.7 billion estimates indicate +7.2% and +7.7% changes, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryOracle reported revenues of $12.45 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +8.8%. EPS of $1.19 for the same period compares with $1.03 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $12.45 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of 0%. The EPS surprise was +4.39%.The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates three times over this period.ValuationWithout considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.Comparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.As part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.Oracle is graded D on this front, indicating that it is trading at a premium to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.Bottom LineThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Oracle. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

CMG, Yum! Brands, Inc. YUM and Red Robin Gourmet Burgers, Inc. RRGB.Industry: RestaurantsLink: https://www.zacks.com/commentary/2160061/top-3-restaurant-stocks-to-buy-amid-increasing-industry-salesThe Zacks Retail – Restaurants industry is benefiting from rapid increases in menu prices, average check growth and expansion efforts. The industry participants also benefit from partnerships with delivery channels and digital platforms. Sales have steadily risen, which is a good sign for the industry. However, high wages and food cost inflation woes stay. Stocks like Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc., Yum! Brands, Inc. and Red Robin Gourmet Burgers, Inc. are well-poised to counter the scenario.Industry DescriptionThe Zacks Retail – Restaurants industry comprises several owners and operators of casual, upscale casual, fine dining, full-service and fast-casual restaurants. Some industry participants operate as roasters, marketers and retailers of specialty coffee. Some companies develop, operate, and franchise quick-service restaurants worldwide.A few restaurant operators offer cooked-to-order dishes, which include noodles and pasta, soups, salads and appetizers. Some industry players develop, own, operate, manage, and license restaurants and lounges worldwide. A few companies also operate technology-enabled Japanese restaurants in the United States and provide Japanese cuisine through a revolving sushi service model.4 Trends Shaping the Future of the Restaurant IndustrySales Continue to Increase: Despite facing inflationary pressures, restaurant sales in August saw an uptick, driven by a rapid rise in menu prices, growth in average checks, and ongoing expansion efforts. This marks the sixth consecutive month of sales growth for the industry. Per the U.S. Census Bureau, eating and drinking places recorded total sales of $90.8 billion on a seasonally adjusted basis in August, up 0.3% from July’s downward-revised sales volume of $90.5 billion. The metric increased by 8.2% on a year-over-year basis.Story continuesMost restaurant operators are also gaining from implementing ghost or virtual kitchens. The idea of providing off-premise offerings and a connected curbside service is steadily garnering positive customer feedback.Digitalization to Drive Growth: Restaurant operators’ focus on digital innovation, sales-building initiatives and cost-saving efforts has been a catalyst. With the growing influence of the Internet, digital innovation has become the need of the hour. Restaurant operators constantly partner with delivery channels and digital platforms to drive incremental sales. Partnerships with delivery channels like DoorDash, Grubhub, Postmates and Uber Eats and the rollout of self-service kiosks and loyalty programs continue to drive growth.Off-Premise Sales Acting as a Key Catalyst: The industry has been gaining from the increase in off-premise sales, which primarily include delivery, takeout, drive-thru, catering, meal kits, and off-site options such as kiosks and food trucks. Most restaurant operators have initiated testing of ghost or virtual kitchens. The idea of providing off-premise offerings along with a connected curbside service has been garnering positive customer feedback.Traffic Woes &amp; High Costs Linger: The restaurant industry has been facing declining traffic for quite some time now. A rapid increase in menu prices is the primary reason behind traffic erosion. Restaurant operators are grappling with the high cost of operations. Intense competition, high wages and food cost inflation remain concerns. The industry is persistently bearing increased expenses, which have been affecting margins. Higher pre-opening costs, marketing expenses and costs related to sales-boosting initiatives are exerting pressure on the company’s margins.Zacks Industry Rank Indicates Bright ProspectsThe Zacks Gaming industry is grouped within the broader Retail-Wholesale sector.

Brands (YUM)YUM stock: the yum logo on the side of a buildingSource: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock.comYum! Brands (NYSE:YUM) is a fast-food giant that owns the KFC, Pizza Hut, Taco Bell and The Habit Restaurants chains. It is present in more than 155 countries and has more than 54,000 restaurants, 60% of which are located abroad. KFC generates about half of the total revenue and operating profit of the company. Yum! has increased its dividend for six consecutive years.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsIn early August, Yum! Brands reported financial results for the second quarter of 2023. The company grew its currency-neutral sales 13% over the prior year’s quarter thanks to 9% same-store sales growth and 6% growth of store count. KFC, Taco Bell and Pizza Hut grew their sales 19%, 7% and 7%, respectively. Digital sales rose to a new all-time high of $7 billion and exceeded 45% of total sales. Thanks to the strong business performance, earnings-per-share grew 33%, from $1.06 to $1.41, and exceeded the analysts’ consensus by 17 cents.The company’s recent growth is due to a major organizational change to aggressively increase its franchised store count. It spun off its Chinese segment and refranchised its stores at a fast pace, from 77% in 2016 to 98% currently. Yum! Brands used proceeds from the sale of its stores to franchisees to buy back shares. In addition, thanks to the refranchising, the company has become more efficient, with much lower operating expenses and a wider operating margin.Story continuesYum! Brands has returned to strong growth mode thanks to the growth of its store count and its same-store sales. It has greatly rewarded shareholders with its refranchising and aggressive share repurchases. The company expects to grow its store count by 4%-5% per year in the upcoming years. During the last five years, Yum! has grown its earnings per share (EPS) at approximately 9% per year.The strength of its brands and their appeal to consumers constitute a significant competitive advantage. Thanks to its established brands, the company enjoys reliable free cash flows. As a result, the company is not likely to have issues servicing its debt. It is also worth noting that Yum! Brands has proved markedly resilient during recessions, mostly thanks to its low-priced menu offerings. This allows the company to pay dividends, even during downturns.Mondelez International (MDLZ)The Mondelez website magnified by a magnifying glassSource: ShutterstockMondelez International (NASDAQ:MDLZ) was established in 2012 when Kraft Foods renamed itself Mondelez and retained its snack food business, while its grocery business was spun off to a new company called Kraft Foods Group.

For the quarter, net revenue increased 17% year-over-year, with organic net revenue growth of 15.8%, which was driven by strong volume/mix performance. Adjusted earnings per share rose 16.9% (and 21.5% on a constant currency basis) to 76 cents for the quarter.Organic net revenue growth of 37.7% was the strongest in Latin America, followed by 13.2% growth in Asia, the Middle East, and Africa; 13.1% in Europe; and 12.4% in North America. Emerging markets showed a bit greater growth of 19.7% versus developed markets of 16.2%. Adjusted EPS climbed 13% (and 19.9% on a constant currency basis) to $1.65. Mondelez also increased its quarterly dividend by 10.4% to $0.425. It has increased its dividend for nine consecutive years.Since the Kraft Foods spinoff in 2012, Mondelez has seen steady growth. From 2013 to 2022, it grew EPS by 7.7% per year. Organic growth as well as acquisitions have fueled its earnings-per-share growth, along with share buybacks. Revenue is the primary driver of earnings growth with margins remaining steady in normal market conditions.Mondelez’ dividend payout ratio is about 50%. The payout is safe, even in a recession. It expects to generate free cash flow of more than $3.3 billion for the current year. Given Mondelez’s operating history and the stable sales performance of its core brands, it should be resilient to recessions. Its competitive advantages include its broad assortment of consumer favorites as well as its diverse distribution base and global supply chain.Constellation Brands (STZ)Constellation Brands logo on a phone screen in front of a blue and purple background.

The group holding the most number of shares in the company, around 70% to be precise, is institutions. Put another way, the group faces the maximum upside potential (or downside risk).Given the vast amount of money and research capacities at their disposal, institutional ownership tends to carry a lot of weight, especially with individual investors. Hence, having a considerable amount of institutional money invested in a company is often regarded as a desirable trait.In the chart below, we zoom in on the different ownership groups of McDonald's. See our latest analysis for McDonald's ownership-breakdownWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About McDonald's?Institutions typically measure themselves against a benchmark when reporting to their own investors, so they often become more enthusiastic about a stock once it's included in a major index. We would expect most companies to have some institutions on the register, especially if they are growing.McDonald's already has institutions on the share registry. Indeed, they own a respectable stake in the company. This can indicate that the company has a certain degree of credibility in the investment community. However, it is best to be wary of relying on the supposed validation that comes with institutional investors. They too, get it wrong sometimes. If multiple institutions change their view on a stock at the same time, you could see the share price drop fast. It's therefore worth looking at McDonald's' earnings history below. Of course, the future is what really matters.earnings-and-revenue-growthSince institutional investors own more than half the issued stock, the board will likely have to pay attention to their preferences. We note that hedge funds don't have a meaningful investment in McDonald's. The company's largest shareholder is The Vanguard Group, Inc., with ownership of 9.4%. BlackRock, Inc. is the second largest shareholder owning 7.0% of common stock, and State Street Global Advisors, Inc. holds about 4.7% of the company stock.Story continuesOn studying our ownership data, we found that 25 of the top shareholders collectively own less than 50% of the share register, implying that no single individual has a majority interest.While studying institutional ownership for a company can add value to your research, it is also a good practice to research analyst recommendations to get a deeper understand of a stock's expected performance. There are plenty of analysts covering the stock, so it might be worth seeing what they are forecasting, too.Insider Ownership Of McDonald'sThe definition of an insider can differ slightly between different countries, but members of the board of directors always count. Management ultimately answers to the board. However, it is not uncommon for managers to be executive board members, especially if they are a founder or the CEO.Insider ownership is positive when it signals leadership are thinking like the true owners of the company. However, high insider ownership can also give immense power to a small group within the company. This can be negative in some circumstances.Our most recent data indicates that insiders own less than 1% of McDonald's Corporation. As it is a large company, we'd only expect insiders to own a small percentage of it. But it's worth noting that they own US$234m worth of shares. It is always good to see at least some insider ownership, but it might be worth checking if those insiders have been selling. General Public OwnershipWith a 30% ownership, the general public, mostly comprising of individual investors, have some degree of sway over McDonald's. While this group can't necessarily call the shots, it can certainly have a real influence on how the company is run.Next Steps:It's always worth thinking about the different groups who own shares in a company. But to understand McDonald's better, we need to consider many other factors. For example, we've discovered 2 warning signs for McDonald's that you should be aware of before investing here.If you are like me, you may want to think about whether this company will grow or shrink.

Here’s why the pork sandwich is an undead fan favorite,Fortune,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/mcdonald-mcrib-back-dead-just-214010253.html,1696455610,STORY,['MCD'],"[Witch? More like sandwich. McDonald’s is ringing in spooky season as the seasons grow colder with the announcement of its McRib rising from the ashes like some kind of pork phoenix. Much like the eternal zombie, the pork sandwich is back from the dead, and consumers are clamoring to get their hands on menu item.McDonald’s announced on Saturday it was bringing the McRib back to select chain locations for a limited time on November 1. The fast food chain is known for utilizing a scarcity tactic to keep customers coming back to the cult classic sandwich, having sunsetted the menu item at least four times, only for it to return time and time again. In its 40-year history, the elusive McRib has been the star of numerous viral pop culture moments, like a parody in a 2003 episode of The Simpsons and the dawn of the McRib Locator in 2008.“The McRib is the GOAT of sandwiches on our menu. And so like the GOATs Michael Jordan, Tom Brady, and others, you’re never sure if they’re fully retired or not,” McDonald’s CEO Chris Kempczinski told Restaurant Business, a trade publication, last year during the sandwich’s most recent “farewell tour.”But fans might have a difficult time finding the seasoned, barbecue-slathered pork sandwich: “While it won’t be available nationwide, some lucky fans may find their favorite elusive saucy sandwich at their local McDonald’s restaurants this November,” McDonald’s said in a statement to MarketWatch on Wednesday.That is part of the gimmick, of course. The McRib is hard to find and never around for long. Why? McDonald’s wants customers to “enjoy our famous pork sandwich as if it’s your last,” the promotional materials from the 2022 farewell tour read. This helped McDonald's to a win earlier this year, when it reported fourth quarter same-store sales of 12.6%, beating Wall Street expectations of 8.8%. The McRib can't stay dead because it's big business.Grimace ShakeWhile the McRib seems to latch onto the zeitgeist in every iteration, another factor behind a recent sales boost was a dark and bizarre social media trend involving another undead feature of the brand—the previously retired purple mascot named Grimace.Story continuesIn June, McDonald’s debuted a vanilla-berry flavored milkshake in honor of the 52nd birthday of Grimace, a giant, purple thing introduced in 1971 as ""The Evil Grimace,"" stealing milkshakes from unsuspecting customers. TikTokers would film videos of themselves wishing the mascot a happy birthday and taking a sip of the shake, before pretending to writhe in agony and suffer gruesome fake deaths in horror-movie fashion. The tag #grimaceshake has over 3.7 billion views on TikTok.However, much like the McRib Locator, McDonald’s says it didn’t plant the trend. The company’s social media director, Guillaume Huin, said as much in a LinkedIn post, crediting the success to the “brilliant creativity, unfiltered fun, peak absurdist Gen Z humor” and “the way a new generation of creators and consumers play with brands.”“If you think we planted the Grimace shake trend, thank you. So much. But you think way too highly of us,” Huin wrote.McDonalds' usual play is more that of the McRib style layup than the Grimace shake one-off. The company seemingly found its marketing gold by luring in consumers with limited offers. Sure, the McRib has come and gone a couple times now reading more like an extended Walking Dead-type of zombified run than a short but intense outbreak. But who's to say pork isn't on the menu again next Hallows Eve? The guessing keeps the game going.This story was originally featured on Fortune.com]"

If you want to see more stocks in this selection, go directly to the 5 Best Bear Market Stocks To Buy Now.The US economy successfully avoided a recession owing to its resilient job market. However, it's worth noting that the job market is usually one of the last facets to weaken when interest rates rise. A recurring pattern has emerged in such economic cycles - out of the last nine instances of Federal Reserve rate hikes, seven resulted in an economic recession. The optimism among investors regarding AI's potential to enhance productivity and drive a new phase of growth played a significant role in the stock market's recovery from the severe drop experienced in 2022, particularly in the first half of this year. Despite the Federal Reserve's decision to raise interest rates as a measure to combat inflation, the S&amp;P 500 made an impressive leap of approximately 20%, briefly touching 4600 by the end of July. For Ed Yardeni, the founder of Yardeni Research, this surge was anticipated, albeit arriving ""ahead of schedule,"" indicating an imminent short-term decline.On October 1, Yardeni reflected on his earlier analysis, stating, ""We concluded that the index might fall to its 200-day moving average, which is currently around 4200."" True to that prediction, since that point, the S&amp;P 500 has indeed experienced a decline of about 7%, reaching around 4,280 by midday on October 2. Yardeni suggests that the index could very well decline further to meet their projected 4,200 mark sometime in October. However, beyond that, he foresees a rebound in the market. In recent months, several economists have revised their growth forecasts for the third-quarter GDP, citing the labor market's resilience and strong consumer spending. The economic forecasters on the panel at the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia revised their outlook in August, now anticipating real GDP growth of 1.9% at an annual rate for the third quarter. This represents a significant increase from their initial June forecast of just 0.6%.Story continuesMost Wall Street investors, however, remain unconvinced by the stock market's gains in 2023, fearing a potential further retreat due to looming recession risks. This sentiment was revealed in the recent CNBC Delivering Alpha investor survey, which gathered opinions from approximately 300 key figures in finance, including chief investment officers, equity strategists, portfolio managers, and CNBC contributors. The survey, aimed to gauge investor outlooks on the markets for the remainder of 2023 and beyond, revealed that over 60% of respondents view this year's stock market gain as merely a temporary bounce within a bear market, foreseeing more challenges on the horizon. On the contrary, 39% of investors believe that a new bull market has already begun.As the year progresses into its latter half, the stock market is already displaying signs of the anticipated recession effects, aligning with J.P. Morgan Research's predictions. It foresees a gradual economic downturn in the United States by late 2023 due to the cautious approach taken by the Federal Reserve, resulting in stricter credit conditions that will slowly exert downward pressure on economic growth. While numerous stocks are experiencing a downward trajectory, specific industries are thriving amidst this economic strain, making their respective stocks appealing investment prospects for global investors. Some notable sectors include Utilities, Healthcare, Consumer Staples, Communication Services, DIY, and related industries. These stocks generally possess a safeguarded profitability, less susceptible to economic cycle fluctuations and changes in consumer confidence.Given the situation, investors are actively seeking out top-performing stocks during a bear market to safeguard their investments. Notably, companies such as Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (NYSE:BRK-B), Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG), and Visa Inc. (NYSE:V) are drawing the interest of investors amid the prevailing bearish trend in the markets.Most Promising Tech Stocks According to AnalystsPhoto by Adam Nowakowski on UnsplashOur MethodologyOur list for the best bear market stocks to buy is grounded in hedge fund sentiment towards each stock.

CVS has been moving its portfolio to a more value-based outcome model, and Aetna was a major move in that direction. We were willing to accept the leverage that came with the deal because CVS has a very cash generative model, and we anticipated the free cash flow would enable the company to de-lever fairly quickly.By mid-2022, CVS was in a position to use the free cash flow that had been going to debt repayment to do bolt-on deals to further prepare for the value-based outcome model and/or return more cash to shareholders in the form of higher dividends or share repurchases. However, CVS lost a “star” in its largest Medicare plan in late 2022 and this will adversely impact earnings in 2024. This was a surprise and disappointment to us, but management should be able to regain the “star” in the back half of 2023, which will then give the company a nice tailwind in 2025…” (Click here to read the full text)12.

It is worth considering McDonald's (MCD), which belongs to the Zacks Retail - Restaurants industry.This world's biggest hamburger chain has an established record of topping earnings estimates, especially when looking at the previous two reports. The company boasts an average surprise for the past two quarters of 14.15%.For the most recent quarter, McDonald's was expected to post earnings of $2.77 per share, but it reported $3.17 per share instead, representing a surprise of 14.44%. For the previous quarter, the consensus estimate was $2.31 per share, while it actually produced $2.63 per share, a surprise of 13.85%.For McDonald's, estimates have been trending higher, thanks in part to this earnings surprise history. And when you look at the stock's positive Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction), it's a great indicator of a future earnings beat, especially when combined with its solid Zacks Rank.Our research shows that stocks with the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time. In other words, if you have 10 stocks with this combination, the number of stocks that beat the consensus estimate could be as high as seven.The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is related to change. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.McDonald's has an Earnings ESP of +1.11% at the moment, suggesting that analysts have grown bullish on its near-term earnings potential. When you combine this positive Earnings ESP with the stock's Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), it shows that another beat is possibly around the corner. The company's next earnings report is expected to be released on October 30, 2023.Story continuesInvestors should note, however, that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss, but a negative value does reduce the predictive power of this metric.Many companies end up beating the consensus EPS estimate, but that may not be the sole basis for their stocks moving higher. On the other hand, some stocks may hold their ground even if they end up missing the consensus estimate.Because of this, it's really important to check a company's Earnings ESP ahead of its quarterly release to increase the odds of success.

Meanwhile, the Dow experienced a rise of 0.39%, and the technology-dominated Nasdaq saw an increase of 1.35%.The industrial real estate developer's stock has dropped by 11.92% in the past month, falling short of the Finance sector's loss of 6.45% and the S&amp;P 500's loss of 6.19%.The upcoming earnings release of Prologis will be of great interest to investors. The company's earnings report is expected on October 17, 2023. On that day, Prologis is projected to report earnings of $1.26 per share, which would represent a year-over-year decline of 27.17%. Alongside, our most recent consensus estimate is anticipating revenue of $1.71 billion, indicating a 48.36% upward movement from the same quarter last year.Looking at the full year, the Zacks Consensus Estimates suggest analysts are expecting earnings of $5.59 per share and revenue of $6.74 billion. These totals would mark changes of +8.33% and +37.09%, respectively, from last year.Any recent changes to analyst estimates for Prologis should also be noted by investors. These latest adjustments often mirror the shifting dynamics of short-term business patterns. As a result, we can interpret positive estimate revisions as a good sign for the company's business outlook.Based on our research, we believe these estimate revisions are directly related to near-team stock moves. To take advantage of this, we've established the Zacks Rank, an exclusive model that considers these estimated changes and delivers an operational rating system.The Zacks Rank system, running from #1 (Strong Buy) to #5 (Strong Sell), holds an admirable track record of superior performance, independently audited, with #1 stocks contributing an average annual return of +25% since 1988.

As of now, Prologis holds a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold).Story continuesDigging into valuation, Prologis currently has a Forward P/E ratio of 19.24.

Comparable to the widely accepted P/E ratio, the PEG ratio also accounts for the company's projected earnings growth. The REIT and Equity Trust - Other industry currently had an average PEG ratio of 2.11 as of yesterday's close.The REIT and Equity Trust - Other industry is part of the Finance sector.

Paccar (PCAR), which belongs to the Zacks Automotive - Domestic industry, could be a great candidate to consider.When looking at the last two reports, this truck maker has recorded a strong streak of surpassing earnings estimates. The company has topped estimates by 16.25%, on average, in the last two quarters.For the most recent quarter, Paccar was expected to post earnings of $2.14 per share, but it reported $2.33 per share instead, representing a surprise of 8.88%. For the previous quarter, the consensus estimate was $1.82 per share, while it actually produced $2.25 per share, a surprise of 23.63%.Thanks in part to this history, there has been a favorable change in earnings estimates for Paccar lately. In fact, the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) for the stock is positive, which is a great indicator of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with its solid Zacks Rank.Our research shows that stocks with the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time.

As some of the biggest and most popular enterprises, the blue chips don’t inherently seem a place to look for red flags. However, as the bankruptcy of Hertz (NASDAQ:HTZ) during the Covid-19 pandemic proved, even the alpha dogs can suffer devastating blows.Further, while being an industry giant affords privileges such as a track record and a framework of stability, none of these factors guarantee sustained success. The harsh reality is that the industry can change or consumer habits can evolve, leaving once-storied blue-chip stocks lurching.Now, I’m not about to present a complete doom-and-gloom narrative for the below enterprises. However, it’s also time to address some harsh realities. Here are the blue-chip stocks to sell (or at least to consider doing so).InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsBlue-Chip Stocks: Nordstrom (JWN)A Nordstrom (JWN) storefront in Toronto, Canada.Source: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.comProbably one of the blue-chip stocks to sell that’s likely not catching anyone by surprise, luxury department store stalwart Nordstrom (NYSE:JWN) faces significant challenges. It’s not just that shares are down more than 10% this year, although that’s a serious concern. After all, the benchmark S&amp;P 500 index gained nearly 12% during the same period. Rather, broader dynamics don’t bode well for JWN.With factors such as stubbornly high inflation, mass layoffs and record-breaking credit-card debt converging, fewer people have discretionary funds available. Even if they did, the smart thing to do amid all these problems is to save as much money as possible. If a recession materializes, it’s unlikely that the majority of the workforce will go unscathed.Not surprisingly, the options market has seen some bearish trades. Notably, on Sept. 11, a trader (or traders) bought 3,006 contracts of the Jan 19 ’24 12.50 Put, which seems an aggressively bearish bet. The premium paid for this transaction was $270,000. Also, analysts peg JWN a moderate sell, with only one analyst seeing it as a buy.Story continuesCampbell Soup (CPB)A variety of Campbell's soups in a grocery store. CPB stock.Source: Sheila Fitzgerald / ShutterstockAt first glance, Campbell Soup (NYSE:CPB) doesn’t seem like a natural candidate for blue-chip stocks to sell. As a food producer – and an iconic one at that – Campbell should theoretically perform well during this cycle of ambiguity. After all, everyone needs to eat, with the company providing a cheap but tasty means of feeding this core demand.Unfortunately, investors simply have other ideas. Since the beginning of the year, CPB gave up more than 26% of equity value. Part of that centers on the harsh consumer economy. In June, CPB slumped due to shoppers pulling back because of price hikes. Put another way, the trade-down effect has reared its ugly head against the canned soup maker.To be fair, a major transactions involving bought calls that expire January next year suggests some optimism. However, a main issue with Campbell now is its balance sheet. With a cash-to-debt ratio sitting at only 0.04x, sustainability woes linger. Also, analysts peg CPB a moderate sell. Conspicuously, among 13 experts, not a single one assigned it a buy rating.T. Rowe Price (TROW)T row price (TROW) logo magnified through a lens while displayed on a web browserSource: Pavel Kapysh / Shutterstock.comAlthough T. Rowe Price (NASDAQ:TROW) offers a contrarian angle, the global investment management firm may be best left as one of the blue-chip stocks to avoid. Since the start of the year, TROW lost a bit more than 5% of equity value. In the trailing five years, it’s also down 5%. The problem is that the surge of meme traders has faded, leaving TROW look rather irrelevant.Of course, the contrarian might pop in and say that the best time to be in the market is during a bearish cycle. While that may be true, you must also consider the other side. During downturns, people lose their jobs. So, the idea of collecting massive profits due to short speculation has a clear constraint. To be fair, implied volatility (IV) for TROW options peaks at 73% for far out-the-money (OTM) calls. However, the IV peaks at 71% for far OTM puts, which means that traders may be hedging for downside risk.Finally, analysts rate TROW a moderate sell. Also, the average price target is only $104.20, implying less than 1% upside.On the date of publication, Josh Enomoto did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.A former senior business analyst for Sony Electronics, Josh Enomoto has helped broker major contracts with Fortune Global 500 companies.

From incorporating inventory management systems to predict and analyze inventory levels for logistics service providers to fifth-party logistics partners offering all-in-one logistics solutions, the industry has evolved. On January 13, DHL reported that the company has also been following some of the emerging trends in the market. A prime example of the company’s innovation would be its Logistics Trend Radar which is updated every 2 years and works as a benchmark for innovation in the logistics industry as it shows different social, business, and technological trends that could impact the future of logistics. Customers have also been keen to choose companies that offer sustainable delivery options. This is evident from a survey studying customers in the US, Europe, and Canada where 54% of them expressed willingness to wait for a sustainable delivery process. Back in September 2022, the company led a maiden flight with its first fully electric commuter plane.Story continuesOn June 30, PwC reported that logistics companies resort to acquisitions as a potential way to become less vulnerable to economic shocks by positioning themselves for the long term. Efforts to make supply chains more integrated have been made by logistics companies in the US since this could be their differentiating factor.A Competitive LandscapeThe logistics market in the US is saturated with many market players, while FedEx Corporation (NYSE:FDX), United Parcel Service, Inc. (NYSE:UPS), and Old Dominion Freight Line (NASDAQ:ODFL) hold the biggest market shares. You can also view some of the cheap transportation stocks to buy.FedEx Corporation (NYSE:FDX) is a leading American multinational known for its delivery services across the globe. The company has emerged with the ""when it absolutely positively has to be their overnight"" slogan, focusing on timely deliveries. On September 20, the company reported strong earnings for the first fiscal quarter of 2024. The company reported earnings per share of $4.55, beating EPS estimates by $0.80. The company's revenue for the quarter amounted to $21.68 billion.On September 21, Reuters reported that the strong quarterly earnings can be attributed to the cost-cutting measures taken by FedEx Corporation (NYSE:FDX) to win customers. The company also availed the golden opportunity to pick up 400,000 more packages per day after customers from its main rival, United Parcel Service, Inc. (NYSE:UPS), switched to alternate carriers. The company was also successful in acquiring market share from the Yellow Corporation (NASDAQ:YELL) which recently went bankrupt.United Parcel Service, Inc. (NYSE:UPS) accounts for almost a quarter of parcel deliveries in the United States and spans over the whole country. On October 4, Reuters reported that the company has been offering discounts to capture customers during a low demand season. This demand shrinkage has been since customers have been subject to higher prices for necessities such as food, fuel, and shelter. However, the company said in a statement that these discounts were being offered to attract high-value and high-volume customers. Retail stores in the US which are customers of the company also made savings while negotiating cheaper prices with the parcel delivery market leader.Old Dominion Freight Line (NASDAQ:ODFL) is a major market player in the less-than-truckload (LTL) logistics. The company has also been subject to industry risks. The company reported lower revenues for the fiscal second quarter of 2023. This was due to a decrease in fuel surcharge revenue and declining industry demand. However, the company’s shipments per day increased from 47,000 in July to 50,000 in August. Thus, the company did win market share from its former direct competitor, Yellow Corporation (NASDAQ:YELL). The company has also been trying to mitigate demand fluctuations and reduce costs.Thus, logistic carriers such as FedEx Corporation (NYSE:FDX), United Parcel Service, Inc. (NYSE:UPS), and Old Dominion Freight Line (NASDAQ:ODFL) fulfill the domestic shipping demands of US consumers.

The new ""Return a Package"" function can book drivers to pick up and deliver packages or return orders to postal carriers, like FedEx (FDX) and UPS. Yahoo Finance Live reacts to the new service and the convenience it could offer customers.For more expert insight and the latest market action, click here to watch this full episode of Yahoo Finance Live.Video TranscriptBRAD SMITH: Uber is giving you a new way to ship your packages. The new Return a package feature will allow users to send out up to five packages at once through their Uber driver who will pick up the packages and drop them off at UPS, FedEx, or USPS. Yeah, I think I would opt into this pretty quickly. I mean, I guess the specs around this too-- I guess you have to make sure that it's ready to ship, which is usually my issue. But again, this at least takes out some of the friction of having to go in person yourself.SEANA SMITH: Yeah, I think that this is smart by Uber, right? It seems like a relatively light lift for them, another way just to further diversify their revenue stream and grow their business, make it more of a one-stop-shop for everything regarding transportation, whether that's taking you somewhere, whether that's delivering your food, whether that's returning the packages for you and transporting them to USPS, UPS, or FedEx.It is, though, similar-- these types of offerings are available obviously for those three, for USPS, for FedEx, and also for UPS, but also for DoorDash. So this is Uber just becoming the latest player within this space. And what, it costs, like you said, $5 for pickup. I think it's only $3 if you're a member. It's not too bad. It's very convenient. And we know that people throughout the pandemic have become very reliant on delivery services, on convenience. They want everything at their fingertips. I would think that this would play very well with those that already use Uber.BRAD SMITH: Yeah, indeed. I think this is just another revenue-driving opportunity for them as they try to create more of that ecosystem around the Uber app as it is right now, whether it's food, whether that's mobility either for yourself or for your packages. This is one additional add-on to that.]"

And American Express cards offer attractive perks for international travelers, such as rental car insurance* and no foreign transaction fees.Other options you might consider are travel cards from Chase and from Capital One that currently have intro offers worth over $700. Both cards partner with many airline frequent flyer programs, but not with Delta. So, if Delta is your primary airline, one of the SkyMiles American Express cards profiled here may be your best bet.Delta's recent changes to their SkyMiles Program and restrictions on Delta airport lounge access have left many customers upset. The airline is now calculating loyalty status based on the amount of money spent, rather than through the number of miles flown, and is also increasing the Medallion Qualifying Dollar (MQD) thresholds to reach Medallion status. The changes are slightly different for each card, as we have detailed above.Want more credit card options? Check out our other picks for travel rewards credit cards.

The opportunity to earn a varied set of statement credits and benefits of advanced digital tools is also infused within the upgraded card offering.

325,ed2eaeb0-92b2-3ec2-a559-f84986b13d38,AXP,2023-10-05,Is Trending Stock American Express Company (AXP) a Buy Now?,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/trending-stock-american-express-company-130006274.html,1696424406,STORY,['AXP'],"[American Express (AXP) has recently been on Zacks.com's list of the most searched stocks. Therefore, you might want to consider some of the key factors that could influence the stock's performance in the near future.Over the past month, shares of this credit card issuer and global payments company have returned -9.3%, compared to the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's -6.2% change. During this period, the Zacks Financial - Miscellaneous Services industry, which American Express falls in, has lost 7.6%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?While media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.Revisions to Earnings EstimatesHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.Our analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.American Express is expected to post earnings of $2.98 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +20.7%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed +0.1%.The consensus earnings estimate of $11.13 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of +13%. This estimate has remained unchanged over the last 30 days.Story continuesFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $12.50 indicates a change of +12.3% from what American Express is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has remained unchanged.With an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for American Express.The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPSProjected Revenue GrowthWhile earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.In the case of American Express, the consensus sales estimate of $15.44 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of +13.9%. The $60.82 billion and $66.72 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of +15.1% and +9.7%, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryAmerican Express reported revenues of $15.05 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +12.4%. EPS of $2.89 for the same period compares with $2.57 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $15.42 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of -2.34%. The EPS surprise was +3.21%.Over the last four quarters, American Express surpassed consensus EPS estimates two times. The company topped consensus revenue estimates two times over this period.ValuationWithout considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.Comparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.The Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.American Express is graded B on this front, indicating that it is trading at a discount to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.ConclusionThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about American Express. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

330,08d9ca9d-7bcd-3294-8a66-e1b8949d8bb4,NI,2023-10-05,Don’t Miss the Boom: 7 Utilities Stocks Set to Explode Higher,InvestorPlace,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/don-t-miss-boom-7-002709181.html,1695947229,STORY,"['EXC', 'NIMC', 'PCG', 'NEE', 'SRE', 'DUK-PA']","[Amid a still-stubbornly high backdrop of inflation, the narrative for utilities stocks to buy stands as a cynical bright spot. Basically, everyone must pay their bills associated with core services. Otherwise, no pay, no play.Fundamentally, utilities stocks benefit from a natural monopoly. Legally speaking, an enterprise could potentially compete with a utility powerhouse. However, the barriers to entry – from the costs involved and the regulatory hoops – prevent would-be rivals from even trying. Therefore, these established giants can almost do whatever they want.Second, there’s no trade-down effect involved with utilities stocks because it’s a binary proposition. Unless you go off the grid completely, you either have the critical service or you don’t. Therefore, folks pay up because they have no choice, which bodes well for the below entities.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsDuke Energy (DUK)The logo for Duke Energy (DUK) is seen on a sign at one of the company's offices.Source: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.comA seemingly top-tier idea among utilities stocks to buy, Duke Energy (NYSE:DUK) theoretically should be performing a lot better than it has. An electric power and natural gas holding firm, Duke provides coverage to compelling regions, such as the Carolinas. With millennials increasingly moving to these places on or near the eastern coastline, Duke operates where the money is going.However, since the January opener, shares have slipped more than 13%. In the trailing one-year period, DUK lost almost 10%, which doesn’t seem congruent with its relevance. However, a look at Fintel’s options flow screener – which targets big block trades likely made by institutions – presents an encouraging canvas.While options trades in September have been decidedly bearish, the most recent transaction provides hope. Basically, a major trader (or traders) sold 10,000 contracts of the Nov 17 ’23 85.00 Put, collecting a $1.06 million premium in the process. In my opinion, that seems aggressively bullish. Also, analysts peg DUK as a moderate buy with a $99.75 target, implying nearly 11% upside potential.Story continuesExelon (EXC)The logo for Exelon (EXC) is visible at the top of an office building.Source: photosounds / Shutterstock.comHeadquartered in Chicago, Illinois, Exelon (NASDAQ:EXC) is the largest electric parent company in the U.S. by revenue, per its public profile. Given its massive footprint, one might expect EXC to perform well. However, the opposite is true. Since the beginning of this year, EXC has fallen a bit over 10%. In the past 365 days, shares have gone nowhere, dipping 2%.Adding to the worries, major options traders in this case seem bearish on Exelon. For example, on Sept. 26, a trader bought 672 contracts of the Nov 17 ’23 36.00 Put, paying a premium of nearly $27,000. On Aug. 22, a trader (or several traders) sold 2,708 contracts of the Oct 20 ’23 42.00 Put, collecting a premium of $144,716.However, the risk for the shorts is that all it takes is a rotation away from speculation and toward more reliable entities. You can’t get much more reliable than massive utilities stocks to buy. If you want to go contrarian, analysts rate EXC a strong buy with a $44.44 price target, implying 15% upside.PG&amp;E (PCG)Numerous electric lines are seen at sunset.Source: Pand P Studio / Shutterstock.comOne of the top utilities stocks, PG&amp;E (NYSE:PCG) provides electricity and natural gas service to much of Northern and Central California. Right there, PG&amp;E deserves a look for its massive relevance. Love it or hate it, the Golden State represents the economic engine of the U.S. Without California, our nation wouldn’t quite be the massive superpower that it is.Sure enough, investors seem to recognize this overwhelming catalyst. Since the start of the year, PCG gained just under 5%. That’s nothing to write home about but relatively speaking, that’s a decent run. Still, investors should be aware of some storms brewing in the derivatives market. Specifically, a major trader sold 2,601 contracts of the Nov 17 ’23 17.00 Call, collecting a $158,539 premium.While that’s distracting, keep in mind that PCG stock closed recently at $16.44. All it needs is an understanding that investors may prefer risk-off assets as opposed to risk-on. Thus, it’s possible that PCG can swing higher, blowing up this apparently bearish trade. Oh yeah, analysts rate shares a strong buy with a $19.33 price target.Sempra Energy (SRE)The logo for Sempra (SRE) is seen at the top of an office building.Source: Michael Vi / Shutterstock.comWhile Sempra Energy (NYSE:SRE) as a business doesn’t get much love from its users, it does plenty to earn the respect of shareholders. Actually, I’m not sure if that’s true in the active sense. Rather, Sempra benefits passively by covering segments of the extremely lucrative Southern California market. As stated earlier with PG&amp;E, California represents an economic powerhouse just by itself. So, SRE is one of the utilities stocks to buy.In fairness, though, it doesn’t seem that way. Since the January opener, SRE slipped almost 10%. In the past 365 days, the security gave up nearly 12% of its equity value. And sure enough, institutional traders seem pessimistic about SRE. For example, an entity sold 1,901 contracts of the Nov 17 ’23 75.00 Call on Sept. 21, collecting a nearly $230,000 premium.With SRE down at $69.41 recently, that might seem like a good trade. But Sempra’s consistent profitability could move the needle to the upside, blowing up this bear trade. Lastly, analysts peg shares as a moderate buy with an $82.15 price target, implying over 18% upside.NiSource (NI)Image of a gas burner with a blue flameSource: ShutterstockA concocting mix between speculation and opportunity, NiSource (NYSE:NI) is one of the largest fully regulated utilities stocks in the U.S. Per its public profile, NiSource services approximately 3.5 million natural gas customers and half a million electric customers across six states. That seems powerfully relevant. Unfortunately, NI shares have fallen more than 8% since the January opener.In the past 365 days, NI dipped 7.5%. And in the trailing five years, shares only gained 1%, reflecting how many investors turned to risk-on assets. Adding to the concerns for NI, major traders have been bearish. For instance, on Sept. 27, an entity (or entities) bought 6,099 contracts of the Oct 20 ’23 25.00 Put, paying a premium of $202,500.With shares trading hands at $25.18 recently, it seems this put will go in the money (ITM). However, implied volatility (IV) runs higher on the far out-the-money (OTM) calls than the OTM puts. In other words, I see a clear risk to the bears that investors will rotate toward more reliable ideas. Finally, analysts rate NI a unanimous strong buy with a $30.80 price target.American Electric Power (AEP)the American Electric Power logo is magnified on a websiteSource: Casimiro PT / Shutterstock.comA major investor-owned electric utility in the U.S., American Electric Power (NASDAQ:AEP) delivers electricity to more than five million customers in 11 states, according to its corporate profile. Also, AEP ranks among the nation’s largest generators of electricity, owning nearly 38,000 megawatts of generating capacity. Sadly, investors don’t seem to care right now.Since the January opener, AEP fell 20%. In the trailing one-year period, AEP gave up about 19% of its equity value. Since the spring doldrums of 2020, AEP has gyrated wildly across the map. In addition, the volatile swings have attracted bearish attention. Looking at Fintel’s options flow screener, the latest major transaction (Sept. 21) involved the selling of 1,000 contracts of the Oct 20 ’23 82.50 Call.Overall, the net profile seems bearish on AEP. However, it appears that the institutional options trades will expire on Oct. 20. It’s possible that without this overhang beginning the following Monday, AEP might move higher. It’s speculation, of course. Still, AEP carries a strong buy rating with a $93.38 target, implying over 23% upside potential.NextEra Energy (NEE)Environmental protection, renewable, sustainable energy sources. Plant growing in the bulb concept. renewable energy stocks to buySource: Proxima Studio / Shutterstock.comOn paper, NextEra Energy (NYSE:NEE) seems a shoo-in for utilities stocks to buy. One of the most popular companies given its focus on renewable energy, NextEra commands about 58 gigawatts (GW) of generating capacity. Per its public profile, the company is the largest electric utility holding company by market capitalization. Sadly, it’s not really looking too special in the charts.Since the start of the year, NEE fell more than 28%. Conspicuously, the security gave up nearly 12% of its equity value just in the past one-month period. And even with the decline in market value, NEE trades at a forward earnings multiple of 17.65x. That’s above the sector median of 13.94x, thus ranking worse than 82.48% of the competition.Interestingly, a major trader appears to have bought 4,110 contracts of the Jan 19 ’24 80.00 Put, paying a premium of $3.65 million. This premium represents 10.86 standard deviations above the mean, which is worrying. Still, if NEE bounces back, it could hurt the bears. Interestingly, analysts rate NEE a strong buy with an average price target of $85.46.On the date of publication, Josh Enomoto did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.A former senior business analyst for Sony Electronics, Josh Enomoto has helped broker major contracts with Fortune Global 500 companies.

But the main game is to find enough winners to more than offset the losers At this point some shareholders may be questioning their investment in PPL Corporation (NYSE:PPL), since the last five years saw the share price fall 24%. Furthermore, it's down 14% in about a quarter. That's not much fun for holders.With the stock having lost 5.3% in the past week, it's worth taking a look at business performance and seeing if there's any red flags. See our latest analysis for PPL While the efficient markets hypothesis continues to be taught by some, it has been proven that markets are over-reactive dynamic systems, and investors are not always rational. By comparing earnings per share (EPS) and share price changes over time, we can get a feel for how investor attitudes to a company have morphed over time.During the five years over which the share price declined, PPL's earnings per share (EPS) dropped by 14% each year. The share price decline of 5% per year isn't as bad as the EPS decline. The relatively muted share price reaction might be because the market expects the business to turn around.You can see below how EPS has changed over time (discover the exact values by clicking on the image).earnings-per-share-growthIt might be well worthwhile taking a look at our free report on PPL's earnings, revenue and cash flow.What About Dividends?It is important to consider the total shareholder return, as well as the share price return, for any given stock. The TSR is a return calculation that accounts for the value of cash dividends (assuming that any dividend received was reinvested) and the calculated value of any discounted capital raisings and spin-offs. So for companies that pay a generous dividend, the TSR is often a lot higher than the share price return. As it happens, PPL's TSR for the last 5 years was -4.1%, which exceeds the share price return mentioned earlier. And there's no prize for guessing that the dividend payments largely explain the divergence!Story continuesA Different PerspectiveWhile the broader market gained around 11% in the last year, PPL shareholders lost 11% (even including dividends). Even the share prices of good stocks drop sometimes, but we want to see improvements in the fundamental metrics of a business, before getting too interested. Unfortunately, last year's performance may indicate unresolved challenges, given that it was worse than the annualised loss of 0.8% over the last half decade. We realise that Baron Rothschild has said investors should ""buy when there is blood on the streets"", but we caution that investors should first be sure they are buying a high quality business. It's always interesting to track share price performance over the longer term. But to understand PPL better, we need to consider many other factors. Take risks, for example - PPL has   2 warning signs   we think you should be aware of.Of course PPL may not be the best stock to buy.

Moreover, TSCO has been benefitting from its Life Out Here Strategy, ‘ONETractor’ Strategy, Neighbor’s Club membership program and healthy product demand. Also, the recent acquisition of Orscheln Farm and Home, store-growth initiatives, and comparable store sales growth bode well.Sturdy demand for everyday merchandise, including consumable, usable and edible products, as well as year-round products, have been contributing to comparable store sales (comps) growth. Further, its store growth plans have been aiding the comps performance over the years.The company’s focus on its strategic initiatives has been well-reflected in its share price, with the stock outperforming the industry. Although shares of this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company have lost 9.5% in the year-to-date period, it has outperformed the industry’s decline of 15.8%.Further optimism on the stock is reflected by its forward estimates, which suggest notable growth. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for TSCO’s 2023 sales and earnings suggests growth of 4.7% and 5.6%, respectively, from the year-ago period’s reported numbers. Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment Research Growth StrategiesTractor Supply is on track to build up on its Out Here lifestyle assortment and convenient shopping format to gain customers and market share. The strategy is essentially based on five key pillars —customers, digitization, execution, team members and total shareholder return.As part of the plan, the company has set its long-term financial growth targets for 2022-2026. Management envisions achieving net sales growth of 6-7%, whereas comps are expected to grow 4-5%. The operating margin is expected to be 10.1-10.6% during the said period, with 8-11% growth in earnings per share. The company is also poised to benefit from the launch of Field Activity Support Team (“FAST”), and the implementation of various technology and service enhancements across the enterprise.Additionally, Tractor Supply is focused on integrating its physical and digital operations to offer consumers a seamless shopping experience through its ‘ONETractor’ strategy. The company’s omni-channel investments include curbside pickup, same-day and next-day delivery, a re-launched website, and a new mobile app.Tractor Supply exited the second quarter of 2023 with 31 million Neighbor's Club members, driven by all-time high retention rates and the re-launch of the point-based structure of its Neighbor's Club program. The company’s rebranding of Petsense by Tractor Supply and expansion of its Neighbor's Club program to Petsense stores have received positive customer feedback. This move will enable it to gain pet customers for both banners. Management earlier predicted to reach more than $2 billion in sales by 2026.Tractor Supply is persistently focusing on store growth initiatives, which include the expansion of its store base and the incorporation of technological advancements to induce traffic and drive the top line. As part of its long-term store plan, Tractor Supply targets to reach 3,000 stores in the United States. To achieve this, it anticipates accelerating its annual new store growth to 90 per year in 2025 and 80 stores in 2024. Management intends to open 70 Tractor Supply stores and 10-15 Petsense stores in 2023.Project Fusion is the company’s state-of-the-art space productivity program built to enrich customer experience in the mature store base. Another key component of the company’s space productivity initiatives is the transformation of its Side Lot. It is on track to complete the Orscheln Farm and Home conversions, as well as the Project Fusion remodels and garden center transformations, in 2023.The company’s Project Fusion and Side Lot model transformations have been significant store investments. These investments target achieving higher market share, and boost productivity across the existing and new stores. Notably, TSCO boasts more than 700 Project Fusion stores, accounting for 30% of its store base. It continues to experience a positive halo impact from the garden center to the present store and vice versa. The addition of product categories, greater ease of shopping and modern services help the company serve its customers efficiently.Story continuesHurdles on the WayTractor Supply has been feeling the pinch of inflation woes and rising costs. The company expects consumer spending trends to remain muted through the remainder of 2023. It is also witnessing higher depreciation and amortization, the opening of a distribution center, and the impacts of higher medical claims.Key PicksWe have highlighted three better-ranked stocks from the Consumer Staple sector, namely Abercrombie &amp; Fitch ANF, American Eagle Outfitters AEO and Urban Outfitters URBN.Abercrombie currently sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

Following her 777 album, she also released multiple singles – ""PUSSY,"" a reply to the overturning of Roe v. Wade, her fan-requested ""Another Nasty Song"" and turn-up anthem ""FTCU"" featuring GloRilla &amp; Gangsta Boo.

These investors should also incorporate a company’s future growth potential into their analysis. Investors looking for better returns could consider stocks that might have lower yields today, but stronger long-term growth prospects.The Dividend Challengers are a group of companies with five to nine years of dividend growth. These three Dividend Challengers pay dividends and have future growth potential, meaning they could generate high total returns over the long term.Yum! Brands (YUM)YUM stock: the yum logo on the side of a buildingSource: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock.comYum! Brands (NYSE:YUM) is a fast-food giant that owns the KFC, Pizza Hut, Taco Bell and The Habit Restaurants chains. It is present in more than 155 countries and has more than 54,000 restaurants, 60% of which are located abroad. KFC generates about half of the total revenue and operating profit of the company. Yum! has increased its dividend for six consecutive years.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsIn early August, Yum! Brands reported financial results for the second quarter of 2023. The company grew its currency-neutral sales 13% over the prior year’s quarter thanks to 9% same-store sales growth and 6% growth of store count. KFC, Taco Bell and Pizza Hut grew their sales 19%, 7% and 7%, respectively. Digital sales rose to a new all-time high of $7 billion and exceeded 45% of total sales. Thanks to the strong business performance, earnings-per-share grew 33%, from $1.06 to $1.41, and exceeded the analysts’ consensus by 17 cents.The company’s recent growth is due to a major organizational change to aggressively increase its franchised store count. It spun off its Chinese segment and refranchised its stores at a fast pace, from 77% in 2016 to 98% currently. Yum! Brands used proceeds from the sale of its stores to franchisees to buy back shares. In addition, thanks to the refranchising, the company has become more efficient, with much lower operating expenses and a wider operating margin.Story continuesYum! Brands has returned to strong growth mode thanks to the growth of its store count and its same-store sales. It has greatly rewarded shareholders with its refranchising and aggressive share repurchases. The company expects to grow its store count by 4%-5% per year in the upcoming years. During the last five years, Yum! has grown its earnings per share (EPS) at approximately 9% per year.The strength of its brands and their appeal to consumers constitute a significant competitive advantage. Thanks to its established brands, the company enjoys reliable free cash flows. As a result, the company is not likely to have issues servicing its debt. It is also worth noting that Yum! Brands has proved markedly resilient during recessions, mostly thanks to its low-priced menu offerings. This allows the company to pay dividends, even during downturns.Mondelez International (MDLZ)The Mondelez website magnified by a magnifying glassSource: ShutterstockMondelez International (NASDAQ:MDLZ) was established in 2012 when Kraft Foods renamed itself Mondelez and retained its snack food business, while its grocery business was spun off to a new company called Kraft Foods Group. Mondelez has more than $28 billion in annual revenue. The company has a heavy presence in developing regions — over 60% of total revenue is derived from emerging markets in Asia, the Middle East, Africa and Latin America.Mondelez reported its Q2 2023 results on July 27. For the quarter, net revenue increased 17% year-over-year, with organic net revenue growth of 15.8%, which was driven by strong volume/mix performance. Adjusted earnings per share rose 16.9% (and 21.5% on a constant currency basis) to 76 cents for the quarter.Organic net revenue growth of 37.7% was the strongest in Latin America, followed by 13.2% growth in Asia, the Middle East, and Africa; 13.1% in Europe; and 12.4% in North America. Emerging markets showed a bit greater growth of 19.7% versus developed markets of 16.2%. Adjusted EPS climbed 13% (and 19.9% on a constant currency basis) to $1.65. Mondelez also increased its quarterly dividend by 10.4% to $0.425. It has increased its dividend for nine consecutive years.Since the Kraft Foods spinoff in 2012, Mondelez has seen steady growth. From 2013 to 2022, it grew EPS by 7.7% per year. Organic growth as well as acquisitions have fueled its earnings-per-share growth, along with share buybacks. Revenue is the primary driver of earnings growth with margins remaining steady in normal market conditions.Mondelez’ dividend payout ratio is about 50%. The payout is safe, even in a recession. It expects to generate free cash flow of more than $3.3 billion for the current year. Given Mondelez’s operating history and the stable sales performance of its core brands, it should be resilient to recessions. Its competitive advantages include its broad assortment of consumer favorites as well as its diverse distribution base and global supply chain.Constellation Brands (STZ)Constellation Brands logo on a phone screen in front of a blue and purple background. STZ stock.Source: IgorGolovniov / ShutterstockConstellation Brands (NYSE:STZ) produces and distributes alcoholic beverages including beer, wine and spirits. With over 100 brands in its portfolio, it is the third-largest beer company in the U.S. importing and selling beer brands such as Corona, Modelo Especial, Modelo Negra and Pacifico, along with craft beer brands including Funky Buddha Brewery.In addition, Constellation has many wine brands including Robert Mondavi and Kim Crawford, as well as spirits brands including Svedka Vodka, Casa Noble Tequila and High West Whiskey.The company has increased its dividend for eight consecutive years, including an 11% increase in April 2023.On June 30, Constellation Brands reported first-quarter fiscal 2024 results for the period ending May 31. (Constellation Brands’ fiscal year ends on the last day of February.) For the first quarter, the company recorded $2.5 billion in net sales, a 6% increase compared to the same prior year period, surpassing analysts’ expectations by $40 million. Beer sales improved by 11% year-over-year, while wine and spirits sales declined by -10%.Earnings per share equaled $2.19 for the first quarter, which was a 9% increase compared to fiscal Q1 2023, and 8 cents ahead of analyst estimates. Constellation Brands provided its fiscal 2024 outlook. The company expects adjusted earnings-per-share to be $11.70 to $12.00 for the full fiscal year.Constellation Brands has grown EPS by more than 14% per year in the last decade. In a highly competitive U.S. beer, wine and sprits market, Constellation Brands has differentiated itself with a focus on what the company describes as “premiumization” trends. This means the company is pursuing growth in the high-end of the beer, wine, and spirits categories.Constellation expects to invest $4 billion to $4.5 billion on expanding capacity in Mexico. This will support an additional 25 million to 30 million hectoliters of total capacity. It also includes construction of a new brewery in Southeast Mexico and continued expansion and construction at existing sites in Nava and Obregon. These investments will support future growth for the company’s high-end Mexican beer portfolio.Constellation Brands has several competitive advantages. Its long list of strong brands gives the company pricing power. Its strong distributor network provides an effective route-to-market for the company’s strategy in premium categories. Another benefit of Constellation Brands’ business is that it can withstand downturns very well, as alcoholic beverages are generally resistant to recessions.On the date of publication, Bob Ciura did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

OXY 30-Year Financial DataThe intrinsic value of OXYOccidental Petroleum Corp is an independent exploration and production company with operations in the United States, Latin America, and the Middle East. By the end of 2022, the company reported net proved reserves of 3.8 billion barrels of oil equivalent. Its net production averaged 1,159 thousand barrels of oil equivalent per day in 2022, with a ratio of 75% oil and natural gas liquids and 25% natural gas.With a current stock price of $60.3 per share and a market cap of $53.30 billion, Occidental Petroleum's stock appears to be modestly overvalued when compared to its GF Value of $49.43.Occidental Petroleum (OXY): A Closer Look at its Modest OvervaluationUnderstanding GF ValueThe GF Value is a measure of a stock's intrinsic value, calculated based on historical multiples, a GuruFocus adjustment factor, and future business performance estimates. The GF Value Line represents the fair value at which the stock should ideally be traded. If the stock price is significantly above the GF Value Line, it is overvalued and its future return is likely to be poor. Conversely, if it's significantly below the GF Value Line, its future return will likely be higher.Considering these factors, Occidental Petroleum's stock appears to be modestly overvalued. As a result, the long-term return of its stock is likely to be lower than its business growth.Occidental Petroleum (OXY): A Closer Look at its Modest OvervaluationFinancial StrengthBefore investing in a company, it's crucial to assess its financial strength. Companies with poor financial strength pose a higher risk of permanent loss. The cash-to-debt ratio and interest coverage can provide insights into a company's financial strength. Occidental Petroleum's cash-to-debt ratio is 0.02, which is lower than 92.2% of 1026 companies in the Oil &amp; Gas industry. Overall, the financial strength of Occidental Petroleum is fair, with a score of 5 out of 10.Story continuesOccidental Petroleum (OXY): A Closer Look at its Modest OvervaluationProfitability and GrowthInvesting in profitable companies, especially those with consistent profitability over the long term, is less risky. Occidental Petroleum has been profitable for 6 out of the past 10 years. Over the past twelve months, the company had a revenue of $31.50 billion and Earnings Per Share (EPS) of $5.89. Its operating margin is 29.55%, ranking better than 74.46% of 979 companies in the Oil &amp; Gas industry. Overall, the  profitability  of Occidental Petroleum is fair, with a score of 7 out of 10.Growth is a critical factor in a company's valuation. A faster-growing company creates more value for shareholders, especially if the growth is profitable. The 3-year average annual revenue growth of Occidental Petroleum is 12.3%, which ranks better than 54.3% of 860 companies in the Oil &amp; Gas industry. The 3-year average EBITDA growth rate is 33.1%, ranking better than 71.31% of 826 companies in the Oil &amp; Gas industry.ROIC vs WACCComparing a company's return on invested capital (ROIC) to its weighted average cost of capital (WACC) can help determine its profitability. The ROIC measures how well a company generates cash flow relative to the capital it has invested in its business. The WACC is the rate that a company is expected to pay on average to all its security holders to finance its assets. When the ROIC is higher than the WACC, it implies the company is creating value for shareholders. For the past 12 months, Occidental Petroleum's ROIC is 10.98, and its WACC is 10.29.Occidental Petroleum (OXY): A Closer Look at its Modest OvervaluationConclusionIn summary, the stock of Occidental Petroleum appears to be modestly overvalued.

Not every pick can be a winner, but when you pick the right stock, you can win big. One such superstar is Occidental Petroleum Corporation (NYSE:OXY), which saw its share price soar 517% in three years. In the last week shares have slid back 1.1%. It really delights us to see such great share price performance for investors.Let's take a look at the underlying fundamentals over the longer term, and see if they've been consistent with shareholders returns. Check out our latest analysis for Occidental Petroleum To paraphrase Benjamin Graham: Over the short term the market is a voting machine, but over the long term it's a weighing machine. One imperfect but simple way to consider how the market perception of a company has shifted is to compare the change in the earnings per share (EPS) with the share price movement.During three years of share price growth, Occidental Petroleum moved from a loss to profitability. Given the importance of this milestone, it's not overly surprising that the share price has increased strongly.You can see below how EPS has changed over time (discover the exact values by clicking on the image).earnings-per-share-growthWe know that Occidental Petroleum has improved its bottom line over the last three years, but what does the future have in store? It might be well worthwhile taking a look at our free report on how its financial position has changed over time.What About Dividends?As well as measuring the share price return, investors should also consider the total shareholder return (TSR). Whereas the share price return only reflects the change in the share price, the TSR includes the value of dividends (assuming they were reinvested) and the benefit of any discounted capital raising or spin-off. It's fair to say that the TSR gives a more complete picture for stocks that pay a dividend. As it happens, Occidental Petroleum's TSR for the last 3 years was 528%, which exceeds the share price return mentioned earlier. This is largely a result of its dividend payments!Story continuesA Different PerspectiveOccidental Petroleum shareholders are down 4.6% for the year (even including dividends), but the market itself is up 11%. However, keep in mind that even the best stocks will sometimes underperform the market over a twelve month period. Regrettably, last year's performance caps off a bad run, with the shareholders facing a total loss of 3% per year over five years. Generally speaking long term share price weakness can be a bad sign, though contrarian investors might want to research the stock in hope of a turnaround. While it is well worth considering the different impacts that market conditions can have on the share price, there are other factors that are even more important. Take risks, for example - Occidental Petroleum has   3 warning signs  (and 1 which makes us a bit uncomfortable)  we think you should know about.If you are like me, then you will not want to miss this free list of growing companies that insiders are buying.Please note, the market returns quoted in this article reflect the market weighted average returns of stocks that currently trade on American exchanges.Have feedback on this article?

At the same time, they offer downside protection with their consistent increase in payouts.Additionally, these companies have superior fundamentals like a sustainable business model, a long track of profitability, rising cash flows, good liquidity, a strong balance sheet and some value characteristics.How to Pick Stocks With Solid Dividend Payouts?In order to choose some of the best dividend stocks from the industry, we have run the Zacks Stock Screener to identify stocks with a dividend yield in excess of 2% and a sustainable dividend payout ratio of less than 60%.

If you want to see more stocks in this selection, go directly to the 5 Best Bear Market Stocks To Buy Now.The US economy successfully avoided a recession owing to its resilient job market. However, it's worth noting that the job market is usually one of the last facets to weaken when interest rates rise. A recurring pattern has emerged in such economic cycles - out of the last nine instances of Federal Reserve rate hikes, seven resulted in an economic recession. The optimism among investors regarding AI's potential to enhance productivity and drive a new phase of growth played a significant role in the stock market's recovery from the severe drop experienced in 2022, particularly in the first half of this year. Despite the Federal Reserve's decision to raise interest rates as a measure to combat inflation, the S&amp;P 500 made an impressive leap of approximately 20%, briefly touching 4600 by the end of July. For Ed Yardeni, the founder of Yardeni Research, this surge was anticipated, albeit arriving ""ahead of schedule,"" indicating an imminent short-term decline.On October 1, Yardeni reflected on his earlier analysis, stating, ""We concluded that the index might fall to its 200-day moving average, which is currently around 4200."" True to that prediction, since that point, the S&amp;P 500 has indeed experienced a decline of about 7%, reaching around 4,280 by midday on October 2. Yardeni suggests that the index could very well decline further to meet their projected 4,200 mark sometime in October. However, beyond that, he foresees a rebound in the market. In recent months, several economists have revised their growth forecasts for the third-quarter GDP, citing the labor market's resilience and strong consumer spending. The economic forecasters on the panel at the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia revised their outlook in August, now anticipating real GDP growth of 1.9% at an annual rate for the third quarter. This represents a significant increase from their initial June forecast of just 0.6%.Story continuesMost Wall Street investors, however, remain unconvinced by the stock market's gains in 2023, fearing a potential further retreat due to looming recession risks. This sentiment was revealed in the recent CNBC Delivering Alpha investor survey, which gathered opinions from approximately 300 key figures in finance, including chief investment officers, equity strategists, portfolio managers, and CNBC contributors. The survey, aimed to gauge investor outlooks on the markets for the remainder of 2023 and beyond, revealed that over 60% of respondents view this year's stock market gain as merely a temporary bounce within a bear market, foreseeing more challenges on the horizon. On the contrary, 39% of investors believe that a new bull market has already begun.As the year progresses into its latter half, the stock market is already displaying signs of the anticipated recession effects, aligning with J.P. Morgan Research's predictions. It foresees a gradual economic downturn in the United States by late 2023 due to the cautious approach taken by the Federal Reserve, resulting in stricter credit conditions that will slowly exert downward pressure on economic growth. While numerous stocks are experiencing a downward trajectory, specific industries are thriving amidst this economic strain, making their respective stocks appealing investment prospects for global investors. Some notable sectors include Utilities, Healthcare, Consumer Staples, Communication Services, DIY, and related industries. These stocks generally possess a safeguarded profitability, less susceptible to economic cycle fluctuations and changes in consumer confidence.Given the situation, investors are actively seeking out top-performing stocks during a bear market to safeguard their investments. Notably, companies such as Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (NYSE:BRK-B), Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG), and Visa Inc. (NYSE:V) are drawing the interest of investors amid the prevailing bearish trend in the markets.Most Promising Tech Stocks According to AnalystsPhoto by Adam Nowakowski on UnsplashOur MethodologyOur list for the best bear market stocks to buy is grounded in hedge fund sentiment towards each stock.

CVS has been moving its portfolio to a more value-based outcome model, and Aetna was a major move in that direction. We were willing to accept the leverage that came with the deal because CVS has a very cash generative model, and we anticipated the free cash flow would enable the company to de-lever fairly quickly.By mid-2022, CVS was in a position to use the free cash flow that had been going to debt repayment to do bolt-on deals to further prepare for the value-based outcome model and/or return more cash to shareholders in the form of higher dividends or share repurchases. However, CVS lost a “star” in its largest Medicare plan in late 2022 and this will adversely impact earnings in 2024. This was a surprise and disappointment to us, but management should be able to regain the “star” in the back half of 2023, which will then give the company a nice tailwind in 2025…” (Click here to read the full text)12.

The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Coke has an Earnings ESP of +1.45% at the moment, suggesting that analysts have grown bullish on its near-term earnings potential. When you combine this positive Earnings ESP with the stock's Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), it shows that another beat is possibly around the corner. The company's next earnings report is expected to be released on October 24, 2023.Story continuesWhen the Earnings ESP comes up negative, investors should note that this will reduce the predictive power of the metric. But, a negative value is not indicative of a stock's earnings miss.Many companies end up beating the consensus EPS estimate, but that may not be the sole basis for their stocks moving higher. On the other hand, some stocks may hold their ground even if they end up missing the consensus estimate.Because of this, it's really important to check a company's Earnings ESP ahead of its quarterly release to increase the odds of success.

This preference isn’t just about flavor but has deep roots in the town’s history and its rise of “Coca-Cola millionaires.”In 1919, Coca-Cola made its debut on the public market. Those fortunate enough to purchase a share at its initial price of $40 and continuously reinvest its dividends would be looking at a value of over $10 million today. Such a story highlights the importance of foresight, an eye for recognizing winners, and the patience to hold onto shares over the long term. Just as investing in a then-startup like Coca-Cola offered immense potential, today’s startups present similar opportunities for visionary investors.Until 2016 it was illegal for retail investors to invest in high-growth startups. Thanks to changes in federal law, this Kevin O'Leary-backed startup lets you become a venture capitalist with $100.This startup has already attracted over 1,000 early investors with an impressive 200% year-over-year growth in user engagement. Anyone can get involved.In the early 20th century, Mark “Pat” Munroe, a banker in Quincy, made a key observation that would change the town’s financial landscape. Despite the economic hardships, he noticed that people consistently had money to purchase Coca-Cola. Recognizing an opportunity, Munroe began buying Coca-Cola shares, soon becoming an advocate for the stock within his community. He fervently advised residents to invest, going so far as to underwrite bank loans backed by Coca-Cola stock. Even when shares plummeted by 50% due to a dispute with the sugar industry, Munroe’s confidence in the beverage company did not waver. His resilience would soon be tested further with the onset of the Great Depression.Trending: Airbnb was worth $47 billion at IPO. This Startup Is Automating The Trillion-Dollar Hospitality Market. AI Startup Looks To Put Airbnb Hosting And Property Management On AutopilotStory continuesFrom 1929 to 1932, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average plummeted, losing 89% of its value, Coca-Cola demonstrated its resilience. In 1931, even with unemployment nearing 20%, the sales of Coca-Cola only decreased by a modest 2.3%. Munroe’s earlier observation held true: people were willing to spend their last bit of money on the refreshing drink. The company’s strong financial standing, with $6.5 million in cash and zero debt, ensured it could maintain its dividend payments. For Quincy residents, this meant an essential lifeline during the harshest economic times.Post-recession, Munroe’s faith in Coca-Cola did not sway. He and the town continued their investment journey. The continuous surge in Coca-Cola’s stock value soon brought unparalleled wealth to Quincy. By the late 1940s, this small town had risen to become the richest per capita in the United States.Through Munroe’s advice, Quincy had birthed 67 “Coca-Cola Millionaires.” Many descendants of these early investors potentially still hold onto these shares.Read Next: Warren Buffett once said, ""If you don't find a way to make money while you sleep, you will work until you die.""

352,8b2b218e-f0c8-357d-b3bd-04a15eb54972,KO,2023-10-05,CocaCola Company (The) (KO) is Attracting Investor Attention: Here is What You Should Know,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/cocacola-company-ko-attracting-investor-130010556.html,1696424410,STORY,"['KO', '^GSPC']","[Coca-Cola (KO) has recently been on Zacks.com's list of the most searched stocks. Therefore, you might want to consider some of the key factors that could influence the stock's performance in the near future.Over the past month, shares of this world's largest beverage maker have returned -6.7%, compared to the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's -6.2% change. During this period, the Zacks Beverages - Soft drinks industry, which Coke falls in, has lost 6.6%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?While media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.Earnings Estimate RevisionsHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.We essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.For the current quarter, Coke is expected to post earnings of $0.69 per share, indicating no change from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -0.4% over the last 30 days.The consensus earnings estimate of $2.63 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of +6.1%. This estimate has remained unchanged over the last 30 days.Story continuesFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $2.82 indicates a change of +7% from what Coke is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has remained unchanged.Having a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, Coke is rated Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPSRevenue Growth ForecastEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.For Coke, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $11.48 billion indicates a year-over-year change of +3.8%. For the current and next fiscal years, $45.01 billion and $47.43 billion estimates indicate +4.7% and +5.4% changes, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryCoke reported revenues of $11.97 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +5.7%. EPS of $0.78 for the same period compares with $0.70 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $11.73 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +2.03%. The EPS surprise was +8.33%.Over the last four quarters, Coke surpassed consensus EPS estimates three times. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.ValuationWithout considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.Comparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.As part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.Coke is graded C on this front, indicating that it is trading at par with its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.Bottom LineThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Coke. However, its Zacks Rank #2 does suggest that it may outperform the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

353,c6426932-bd06-3354-bfb9-3f9290cd9489,KO,2023-10-05,"Molson Coors (TAP) Unveils Acceleration Plan, Long-Term Goals",Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/molson-coors-tap-unveils-acceleration-125800309.html,1696424280,STORY,"['TAP-A', 'KO', 'STZ']","[Molson Coors Beverage Company TAP, on its 2023 Strategy Day held in New York, outlined an Acceleration Plan, building on the achievements of its 2019 Revitalization Plan. The company has noted that the Revitalization Plan positioned it to deliver sustainable growth over the past few years. With the success of the Revitalization Plan, TAP is focused on accelerating growth in the years ahead through its new Acceleration Plan.Additionally, the company revealed its long-term financial outlook with expectations of amplified net revenue growth, margin expansion, attractive earnings per share growth and compelling free cash flow generation, which are likely to support reinvestment in value creation.Investors were positive about the company’s announcement of the Acceleration Plan and the resulting long-term financial outlook. Consequently, shares of Molson Coors rose 1.6% in the after-hours trading session on Oct 3, 2023.Moreover, the company’s focus on core competencies has been well-reflected in its share price, with the stock outperforming the industry and the market. Shares of this Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) company have rallied 27.9% in the past year against the industry’s decline of 3%. The stock also fared better than the sector’s fall of 2.7% and the S&amp;P 500’s growth of 13.7% in the same period. Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment Research Key Features of the Acceleration PlanMolson Coors' new growth plan focuses on five key pillars to transform the company and drive sustained success in the global beverage market. These five key pillars focus on growing core brands, aggressively premiumizing its portfolio, expanding in Beyond Beer, building capabilities and efficiencies, and commitment to core values. The company aims to double down on its core strengths while diversifying into new and emerging categories.Firstly, the company is keen on growing revenues of its core power brands. In the United States, its core brands, such as Coors Light, Miller Lite and Coors Banquet, have been witnessing sustained growth in the past several years, positioning them perfectly to capitalize on shifting consumer preferences, particularly in the premium segment in 2023. Similar gains have been observed in other key global markets, such as Molson in Canada and Ozujsko in Croatia, while Carling remains a top brand in the U.K. The company expects to maintain the momentum of these brands.Secondly, Molson Coors is committed to aggressively premiumizing its portfolio, both in the Beer and Beyond Beer categories. Major successes like Madri in the U.K. and Simply Spiked in North America have bolstered net sales from the above-premium portfolio, increasing from 23% in 2019 to an impressive 28% in 2022. The company aims to expand the above-premium segment to approximately one-third of net sales in the medium term. This growth is expected to be driven by building on the current strength of the above-premium portfolio, along with compelling innovations, particularly in Beyond Beer.In its third pillar, the company is focused on scaling and expanding in the Beyond Beer segment, which includes Flavor, Spirits and Non-Alcoholic products. These offerings support the premiumization strategy and emphasize scalable products in high-growth segments. From diverse flavors to acclaimed whiskey brands and energy drinks in partnership with Dwayne Johnson’s ZOA Energy, the Beyond Beer portfolio is poised to drive a substantial portion of the above-premium net sales growth target over the medium term.Furthermore, Molson Coors plans to continue investing in building leading capabilities and efficiencies, including digital transformation, marketing effectiveness, sales execution and sustainability initiatives. These investments, which have already borne fruit since 2019, are expected to drive further growth and margin expansion through productivity improvements, operating efficiencies and cost savings.Lastly, the company reaffirms its commitment to core values, notably putting people first. The contributions of more than 16,000 employees worldwide are acknowledged, along with the foundational principles of the Revitalization Plan. This holistic approach reflects Molson Coors' dedication not only to business growth but also to its employees, communities and the planet.Story continuesLong-Term Financial TargetsMolson Coors provided a comprehensive long-term financial outlook, showcasing its confidence in executing the ambitious growth plan.Over the long term, Molson Coors expects to achieve low-single-digit annual net sales growth on a constant-currency basis. Moreover, the company’s targets indicate its commitment to enhancing its profitability. It expects to deliver mid-single-digit annual underlying income before income tax growth on a constant-currency basis. Additionally, it estimates annual underlying earnings per share growth in the high-single digits for the long term.Molson Coors also expects to maintain a net-debt-to-underlying-EBITDA ratio of under 2.5X over the long term. This reflects a commitment to prudent financial management, including disciplined capital allocation and effective debt management.With provisions for improved financial flexibility, the company also prioritized its capital allocation plan focused on investments in its business, net debt reduction and returning cash to shareholders. As part of the capital allocation plan, the company authorized a new $2-billion share repurchase program, extending for a five-year term.ConclusionBy setting clear objectives across key financial metrics, the company demonstrates its commitment to delivering sustainable growth, enhancing profitability and maximizing shareholder value. With a clear vision and the accelerated growth plan, Molson Coors is poised to navigate the evolving beverage industry landscape and capitalize on emerging opportunities in the global market.Other Key PicksWe have highlighted three other top-ranked stocks from the Consumer Staples sector, namely Constellation Brands STZ, Coca-Cola KO and Compania Cervecerias Unidas CCU.Constellation Brands has a trailing four-quarter earnings surprise of 4.4%, on average.

Developed in collaboration with leading global economist Professor Ufuk Akcigit and his co-authors, the report reveals how macroeconomic pressures like inflation and higher interest rates are affecting small businesses' ability to create jobs and get the funding they need to grow.This press release features multimedia. View the full release here: https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20231005106131/en/Average monthly credit card expenditure (in US dollars) by small business in the US, Canada, and the UK. (Graphic: Business Wire)THE STATE OF SMALL BUSINESSThe report finds that in 2023, while overall employment levels have trended upward in Canada, the US, and UK, small business employment has been less resilient. Using anonymized data from more than 3.4 million Intuit QuickBooks customers and surveys of more than 5,000 small businesses in Canada, the US and the UK, the report looks at how small businesses are responding to these challenges, and examines the relationships between small business growth, access to capital, and use of digital technology. Key findings include:With elevated inflation and high-interest rates, small businesses have increasingly depended on their credit cards, with the current spending being 20% higher, on average, than they were before the pandemic. At the same time, their monthly credit card payments, which include interest charges, are up by 26% on average.These pressures are affecting jobs: small business employment rates declined in seven of the first eight months of 2023 in Canada, and in the first five months of 2023 in the US. Similarly, in the UK, small business job vacancy growth rates declined in all of the first eight months of 2023.The rise of the solopreneur (non-employer businesses) shows entrepreneurship is stronger than ever; however, in Canada and the US, fewer new businesses are creating jobs, a concerning trend because in the US, more than a third of all jobs are with small businesses while in Canada and the UK it’s more than two in five.Access to funding is essential for small business growth, but roughly half of small businesses in Canada, the US and the UK are self-funded by the owner. New businesses and businesses owned by women or members of underrepresented racial groups often face greater funding challenges.Despite inflation declining over the past year, small businesses in Canada, the US and the UK say rising costs are still the number one challenge they face.Story continuesFRESH INSIGHTS ON CANADIAN SMALL BUSINESSESSmall business employment and hiring: In January 2023, Canadian small businesses with 1-19 employees employed 5.2 million people, rebounding to a similar level in August 2023 after several months of declines, before declining again in September (source: Intuit QuickBooks Small Business Index).Small businesses contribute to the economy: In Canada, 99% of all Canadian businesses are small businesses; 47% of all Canadian workers are employed by small businesses.Rise of the solopreneur (non-employer businesses): In 2015, self-employment made up just under 68% of all Canadian businesses. By 2022, this had risen to more than 69%. This rise is significant because it is part of a longer-term trend, similar to the US, where fewer new businesses are creating jobs. The report connects this to the rise of gig work and digital technology.Small business finances: Monthly small business credit card expenditure is currently 18% higher, on average, than before the pandemic, equivalent to $2,700 CAD per business while monthly repayments against credit card account balances are up by 22% on average, again equivalent to $2,700 CAD per business.Small business access to funding: While 51% of Canadian small business owners surveyed have used their own savings to fund their business, only 27% report ever getting funding from a commercial lender. New small businesses (0-5 years old) are more than twice as likely to say ""getting funding"" is their number one challenge compared to older small businesses (21+ years).Adoption of digital tools and technology: Higher use of digital tools and technology (such as software, apps, social media, and e-commerce) correlates with higher growth among small businesses surveyed. Among Canadian small businesses using digital tools to manage 8 or more different areas of their business, 63% report revenue growth and 22% report workforce growth but, among those only managing up to 2 areas with digital tools, this drops to 31% and 5%, respectively.Leading global economist and Arnold C. Harberger Professor of Economics at the University of Chicago, Ufuk Akcigit said: ""We know that small businesses play a significant role in empowering the Canadian economy, in fact, they provide almost half (47%) of jobs in the Canadian economy. In spite of their importance, their size and the challenges accessing capital makes them particularly vulnerable to economic shifts because of inflation and rising interest rates. Despite these challenges, there are reasons for optimism. Using insights from our research, we have developed recommendations that small businesses can take to help ensure their resilience and growth, including staying on top of their cash flow, making smart banking decisions and leveraging the power of digital technology. All of these actions can help small businesses in the face of economic challenges, and the future health of our economy depends on their success today.""Sasan Goodarzi, CEO of Intuit said: ""Becoming an entrepreneur is a bold decision. Given the significant impact new and growing small businesses have on job creation, innovation, and the economy, policymakers and industry leaders should be equally bold in creating an environment where small businesses can grow and thrive. We remain focused on working across the industry to create new and innovative ways to serve our customers and help solve their most pressing challenges.""Based on the research and insights from the report, Intuit has developed a set of recommendations for policymakers, accountants advising their small business clients, and entrepreneurs starting and running small businesses. These concrete, actionable recommendations can help policymakers foster an environment conducive to small business growth and resilience; accountants provide guidance to their clients in responding to the challenges and trends identified in the report; and small business owners set their businesses up for success.For more insights, check out the Intuit QuickBooks Small Business Index Annual Report here.

Similarly, in the UK, small business job vacancy growth rates declined in all of the first eight months of 2023.The rise of the solopreneur (non-employer businesses) shows entrepreneurship is stronger than ever; however, in the US and Canada fewer new businesses are creating jobs, a concerning trend because in the US, more than a third of all jobs are with small businesses while in Canada and the UK it’s more than two in five.Access to funding is essential for small business growth, but roughly half of small businesses in the US, Canada, and the UK are self-funded by the owner. New businesses and businesses owned by women or members of underrepresented racial groups often face greater funding challenges.Despite inflation declining over the past year, small businesses in the US, Canada, and the UK say rising costs are still the number-one challenge they face.Story continuesFRESH INSIGHTS ON US SMALL BUSINESSESSmall business employment/hiring: In January 2023, US small businesses with one to nine employees employed 12.8 million people, but this dropped to 12.7 million by March 2023. Since that low point, employment has rebounded to 13.1 million as of September 2023 (source: Intuit QuickBooks Small Business Index).Small business contributions to the economy: 98% of all US businesses are small businesses; 36% of all US workers are employed by small businesses; new businesses create jobs 1.6 times faster than the national average.Rise of the solopreneur (non-employer businesses): In 2005, there were 2.1 million applications for new businesses in the US; in 2020, there were 4.3 million applications. Over the same period, the number of new businesses with employees fell from 10% in 2005 to roughly 8% in 2020, which could potentially weaken the pipeline for future job creation.Small business finances: Monthly small business credit card spending is currently 20% higher, on average, than before the pandemic, equivalent to $3,000 per business. At the same time, monthly repayments against credit card account balances are 29% higher, equivalent to $4,000 per business.Small business access to funding: While 58% of small business owners surveyed have used their own savings to fund their business, only 22% report ever getting funding from a commercial lender. Small businesses owned by underrepresented racial groups are twice as likely to say ""getting funding"" is their number one challenge. New small businesses (0-5 years old) are 7 times more likely to say ""getting funding"" is their number one challenge compared to older small businesses (21+ years).Higher use of digital tools and technology: Among small businesses using digital tools (such as software, apps, social media, and e-commerce) to manage 8 or more different areas of their business, 55% report revenue growth and 20% report workforce growth while, among those only managing up to two areas with digital tools, this drops to 31% and 7%, respectively.Leading global economist and Arnold C. Harberger Professor of Economics at the University of Chicago, Ufuk Akcigit said: ""The paramount concern for small business owners is the prevailing high inflationary environment. Adding to the challenge, interest rates have reached unprecedented heights. These adverse conditions have compelled business owners to tap into their savings and rely heavily on credit cards, where monthly credit card spending has surged by an average of 20% compared to pre-pandemic levels. When coupled with the increased interest payments on these debts, this translates to thousands of dollars in additional costs each month. Consequently, these shifts are exerting a detrimental effect on small business job creation.""Intuit CEO Sasan Goodarzi said: ""Becoming an entrepreneur is a bold decision. Given the significant impact new and growing small businesses have on job creation, innovation, and the economy, policymakers and industry leaders should be equally bold in creating an environment where small businesses can grow and thrive. We remain focused on working across the industry to create new and innovative ways to serve our customers and help solve their most pressing challenges.""Based on the research and insights from the report, Intuit has developed a set of recommendations for policymakers, accountants advising their small business clients, and entrepreneurs starting and running small businesses. These concrete, actionable recommendations can help policymakers foster an environment conducive to small business growth and resilience; accountants provide guidance to their clients in responding to the challenges and trends identified in the report; and small business owners set their businesses up for success.For more insights, check out the Intuit QuickBooks Small Business Index Annual Report here.

Developed in collaboration with leading global economist Professor Ufuk Akcigit and his co-authors, the report reveals how macroeconomic pressures like inflation and higher interest rates are affecting small businesses' ability to create jobs and get the funding they need to grow.This press release features multimedia. View the full release here: https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20231005420644/en/Intuit QuickBooks Small Business Index Annual Report 2023THE STATE OF SMALL BUSINESSThe report finds that in 2023, while overall employment levels have trended upward in the UK, the US, and Canada, small business employment has been less resilient. Using anonymised data from more than 3.4 million Intuit QuickBooks customers and surveys of more than 5,000 small businesses in the UK, the US and Canada, the report explains how small businesses are responding to these challenges, and examines the relationships between small business growth, access to capital, and use of digital technology. Key findings include:With elevated inflation and high-interest rates, small businesses have increasingly depended on their credit cards, with the current spending being 20% higher, on average, than they were before the pandemic. At the same time, their monthly credit card payments, which include interest charges, are up by 26% on average.These pressures are affecting jobs: in the UK, small business job vacancy growth rates declined in all of the first eight months of 2023. Similarly, small business employment rates declined in the first five months of 2023 in the US and in seven of the first eight months of 2023 in Canada.The rise of the solopreneur (non-employer businesses) shows entrepreneurship is stronger than ever; however, in the US and Canada fewer new businesses are creating jobs, a concerning trend because in the US, more than a third of all jobs are with small businesses while in Canada and the UK it’s more than two in five.Access to funding is essential for small business growth, but roughly half of small businesses in the UK, US, and Canada, are self-funded by the owner. New businesses and businesses owned by women or members of underrepresented racial groups often face greater funding challenges.Despite inflation declining over the past year, small businesses in the UK, US, and Canada say rising costs are still the #1 challenge they face.Story continuesFRESH INSIGHTS ON UK SMALL BUSINESSESThe report also examines the pivotal role of small businesses within the UK economy, evaluating their economic performance, owner characteristics, financing practices, digital transformation efforts, and the diverse array of challenges they encounter. It reveals:Small businesses contribute strongly to the economy: In the UK, nearly 99% of all businesses are small businesses – providing nearly 44% of all jobs (rising 2% between 2011 and 2022). More than 82% of UK firms have less than 10 employees and collectively employ nearly 19% of the country's workforce - in addition to solopreneurs (non-employer businesses) that also contribute a significant proportion of the UK workforce.The rise of the solopreneur (non-employer businesses): The share of non-employee businesses in the UK has increased from 68% in the early 2000s to 74% today. The rise of the gig economy and use of automation tools - which let solopreneurs single-handedly run their operations - could also be facilitating this increase. The UK also has the highest percentage of business owners over 65 – making up 9% of the total group.Self-funding amidst UK small business’ challenges in accessing credit: Nearly half (48%) of small business owners have used personal savings at some point to fund their business. Small businesses in the UK are least likely to have sought funding (with 59% not seeking any) in the past 12 months compared to 48% in the US and 54% in Canada.Cost and availability of funding worsens: About a third (32%) of UK small businesses agree that, over the past 12 months, the cost and availability of financing has deteriorated, rising to 39% amongst the youngest firms aged 0-5 years who are in the crucial early stages.Credit card spending on the rise: At the same time, monthly credit card expenditure has increased 22% since the pandemic - again higher than in the US (20%) and Canada (18%), equivalent to £2,400 per business. Due to the current high-interest rate environment, monthly credit card payments against account balances have risen 25% since pre-pandemic, equivalent to almost £2,000 per business.Going digital to improve resilience: The report indicates a clear correlation between higher use of software, apps, and other digital technologies and better business performance. In the UK – much like the US - a substantial 54% of enterprises that are high users of digital tools (using 8 or more) report positive revenue growth. The report reveals the top three digital tools used by UK small businesses as: social media (51%), business website (50%) and accounting/financial software (45%).Leading global economist, and Arnold C. Harberger Professor of Economics at the University of Chicago, Ufuk Akcigit said: ""The Intuit QuickBooks Small Business Index Annual Report gives unique visibility into the health of small businesses and the issues they are facing today. Inflation rates have been soaring in the UK since 2021, and reached a peak in October 2022. Even now, consumer prices have risen 6.3% in the past 12 months. Against this backdrop, the Annual Report indicates small businesses have been funding their business through their own savings or credit cards - which are incurring extra costs due to higher interest rates. Our goal is for policymakers, industry leaders, and aspiring entrepreneurs to draw valuable conclusions from this in-depth analysis to create policies and foster an environment conducive to the success as well as the resilience of small businesses within these specific sectors and regions. Part of this includes a greater diversity of funding options so small businesses don’t have to struggle with extra costs in today’s high interest environment.""Sasan Goodarzi, CEO of Intuit said: ""Becoming an entrepreneur is a bold decision. Given the significant impact new and growing small businesses have on job creation, innovation, and the economy, policymakers and industry leaders should be equally bold in creating an environment where small businesses can grow and thrive.

This is significantly higher than the industry median, with a price-earnings ratio of 61.31 compared to the industry median of 26.99.

359,7c8fe721-1bce-3ecb-997f-bb9442ec2ec5,SYK,2023-10-05,Reasons to Add Stryker (SYK) Stock to Your Portfolio Now,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/reasons-add-stryker-syk-stock-113900171.html,1696419540,STORY,['SYK'],"[Stryker Corporation SYK is well-poised for growth, backed by a robust robotic arm-assisted surgery platform, Mako, and a diversified product portfolio. However, pricing pressure remains a concern.Shares of this Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) company have risen 8.7% year to date against the industry’s 8.3% decline. The S&amp;P 500 Index has increased 13% in the same time frame.Stryker, with a market capitalization of $104 billion, is one of the world’s largest medical device companies operating in the orthopedic market. It anticipates earnings to improve 10% in the next five years. SYK’s earnings yield of 3.8% compares favorably with the industry’s (2.2%).Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchWhat’s Favoring Stryker’s Growth?Stryker continues to witness strong demand for Mako and a healthy order book amid recovery in procedure-demand following the COVID-19 pandemic. This is due to the platform’s unique and promising features. These developments, in turn, enable the company to sustain the momentum in robotic-treatment sales.SYK is committed to the continued expansion of Mako, with launches in new countries. It remains confident about robust growth in Mako revenues in the second half of 2023, on the back of continued adoption, new launches and software upgrades.The second-quarter results reflected Stryker’s efforts to promote the advanced surgery platform.SYK also boasts a diversified product portfolio. Its wide range of products protects it against any significant sales shortfall during economic turmoil.The company’s significant exposure to robotics and artificial intelligence for healthcare and Medical Mechatronics have helped it stay ahead of the curve in the MedTech space. The company’s portfolio includes Mako as well as products for hip and knee surgeries.On its second-quarter earnings call, Stryker stated that procedural volumes continue to recover in most countries after getting adversely affected last year due to COVID-19. Although hospital staffing pressure remains in certain regions, the company expects this problem to resolve gradually. This improvement, in turn, will likely lead to higher procedures in the rest of 2023.Story continuesPer management, Stryker’s constant support for customers and focus on innovation poise it for growth as the effect of the pandemic subsides. In second-quarter 2023, the company’s adjusted research and development expenses were 6.4% of net sales, highlighting its strong commitment to innovation. According to management, this is likely to drive new product launches.In September 2022, SYK launched a new Spine Guidance Software — Q Guidance System — for spine application. The Q Guidance system has shown promising launch uptake during the first half of 2023. In July, the company commercially launched its Q Guidance system with Cranial Guidance software in the United States.Stryker also launched a fully autonomous guidance system, Ortho Q Guidance, designed specifically for its orthopedic customers the same month. These two developments should bring additional revenues in the rest of 2023.In September, Stryker unveiled the next generation of minimally-invasive surgical cameras, the 1788 platform. The fully-enhanced camera is expected to advance surgery outcomes across multiple specialties. The platform is compatible with the currently-marketed imaging agents and adaptable to new agents and fluorescence modes as they become available.The same month, the FDA granted 510k clearance to its Pangea systems, including Femur, Fibula, Tibia, Humerus and Utility. A potential launch of these two systems is likely to drive top line going forward.Moreover, Stryker’s cost-cutting initiatives to improve margins and lessen inflationary pressure look promising.

But which of these two stocks offers value investors a better bang for their buck right now? We'll need to take a closer look.The best way to find great value stocks is to pair a strong Zacks Rank with an impressive grade in the Value category of our Style Scores system. The Zacks Rank favors stocks with strong earnings estimate revision trends, and our Style Scores highlight companies with specific traits.Right now, DaVita HealthCare is sporting a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy), while Chemed has a Zacks Rank of #4 (Sell). This system places an emphasis on companies that have seen positive earnings estimate revisions, so investors should feel comfortable knowing that DVA is likely seeing its earnings outlook improve to a greater extent. But this is just one factor that value investors are interested in.Value investors also try to analyze a wide range of traditional figures and metrics to help determine whether a company is undervalued at its current share price levels.The Value category of the Style Scores system identifies undervalued companies by looking at a number of key metrics. These include the long-favored P/E ratio, P/S ratio, earnings yield, cash flow per share, and a variety of other fundamentals that help us determine a company's fair value.DVA currently has a forward P/E ratio of 12.69, while CHE has a forward P/E of 25.42. We also note that DVA has a PEG ratio of 1. This figure is similar to the commonly-used P/E ratio, with the PEG ratio also factoring in a company's expected earnings growth rate.

The P/B is a method of comparing a stock's market value to its book value, which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities.

364,1002d0b7-2d1e-38b1-ab72-b1a4f937cd5b,DVA,2023-10-05,Warren Buffett and Ken Griffin Have One Thing in Common: They’re Making a Big Bet on These 3 Stocks,TipRanks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/warren-buffett-ken-griffin-one-141752472.html,1696429072,STORY,"['CHTR', 'DVA', 'SNOW']","[There’s no one way of achieving success in the stock market and different strategies can be used to attain the basic goal: seeing big returns on an investment.Talking of big returns achieved via divergent styles, then we can look at the techniques used by legendary investors such as Warren Buffett and Ken Griffin.Both have had huge success but adhere to different tactics. Buffett made his reputation by favoring value investing, seeking out equities underappreciated at the time and then watching as the market catches up. Meanwhile, making good use of his love of mathematics, Griffin is a proponent of quantitative investment methods.However, that does not mean that both paths do not cross at times. In fact, delving into both market sages’ portfolios, we find that they are both making some big bets on the same names.So, we decided to check out 3 stocks held by both and see why they are such fans. By running these names via the TipRanks database, we can also get an idea for how Wall Street’s cadre of analysts see the future shaping up for these equities. Let’s check the details.Snowflake Inc. (SNOW)For our first Buffett/Griffin favorite, we’ll head to the tech sector, where we find Snowflake, a prominent data warehousing company known for revolutionizing the way organizations store, manage, and analyze their data in the cloud.Snowflake offers a cloud-based data platform that provides businesses with a scalable and flexible solution for their data needs. The company’s key innovation lies in its architecture, which separates data storage from compute resources, allowing users to scale their data warehouses dynamically according to their specific requirements. This unique approach has made Snowflake a preferred choice for organizations looking to harness the power of data analytics without the complexities of traditional on-premises data warehouses.Snowflake’s platform is designed to handle vast amounts of structured and semi-structured data, making it a versatile tool for data analytics, machine learning, and business intelligence applications and its usage has been growing at a fast pace. In the second quarter of fiscal 2024 (July quarter), revenue grew by 35.5% year-over-year to reach $674.02 million, while beating the consensus estimate by $11.74 million. Likewise, adj. EPS of $0.22 outpaced the forecast by $0.12.Story continuesWhile those results exceeded expectations, there have been concerns amongst some investors about growth slowing down. For Q3, the company guided for product revenue between $670 to $675 million, up 28% to 29% compared to the same period a year ago but decelerating sequentially, and the midpoint, below the analyst estimate of $674.9 million.Meanwhile, Buffett has been heavily invested here for a while and currently owns 6,125,375 shares worth $923 million. As for Griffin, he bought the majority of his stack in Q2, and his 838,521 shares command a market value of more than $126 million.HSBC analyst Stephen Bersey has no concerns around slowing growth, and claims Snowflake is set to be a prime beneficiary of AI’s rise.“We believe that Snowflake has demonstrated impressive growth and operating leverage, and we think that the company will deliver turnover and EPS growth above peers for the foreseeable future,” the 5-star analyst said. “The company’s products present a strong value proposition, in our view, as they are focused on an important part of the enterprise technology stack, large dataset management and analysis.”“Notably, we have embedded a tailwind to revenue into our estimates, driven by an increase in global investment spend on AI to capitalize on the recent breakthroughs in the vertical. We see Snowflake as one of the early beneficiaries to this increase in spending as the company’s product portfolio is focused on the critical component of AI, large datasets,” Bersey went on to add.Conveying his confidence, Bersey’s Buy rating is backed by a $201 price target, suggesting SNOW shares will climb ~34% higher over the next 12 months. (To watch Bersey’s track record, click here)Tech names like Snowflake have no trouble catch analyst reviews – and there are 25 such reviews on record for SNOW shares. They break down to 20 Buys and 5 Holds, for a Strong Buy consensus view. At $193.33, the average target implies gains of 28% could be in the cards for the coming year. (See Snowflake stock forecast)DaVita Inc. (DVA)We’ll turn now from tech to healthcare and look at DaVita, one of the largest providers of kidney care services in the United States, serving over 200,000 patients across more than 2,800 dialysis centers. The company also has several hundred others located in 10 countries.DaVita is renowned for its patient-centric approach, focusing on delivering high-quality, personalized care to individuals suffering from chronic kidney disease and end-stage renal disease. The company offers a range of services, including in-center hemodialysis, peritoneal dialysis, home hemodialysis, and nutritional support, with the aim of improving patients’ quality of life and managing their condition effectively.All that combined to deliver a Q2 report boasting beats both on the top-and bottom-line. Revenue of $3 billion represented a 2.4% year-over-year increase and beat Street expectations by $50 million. At the same time, adj. EPS of $1.94 came in ahead of the forecast, by $0.21.Buffett remains long and strong here. He is the owner of 36,095,570 shares, which at the current price are worth $3.36 billion. Griffin’s holdings are more “modest,” with most purchased during Q2. His DVA holdings total 1,286,177 shares, amounting to $120 million.It’s the prospect of growth ahead that UBS analyst Andrew Mok says justifies investors’ attention, even though that seems to go against the Street’s current rhetoric.“We see inflecting treatment growth in 2Q-3Q ahead of accelerating growth in 2024+. Combined with better pricing and a lower cost structure (ESA savings, closed clinics), we see numerous tailwinds that support our Street-high earnings estimates and contrarian Buy rating. Further, our differentiated view that DVA will resume share repurchase in 4Q should serve as a positive catalyst and an accelerant to 2024 EPS not reflected in consensus estimates,” Mok opined.That Buy rating goes alongside a Street-high $142 price target, making room for 12-month returns of 52%. (To watch Mok’s track record, click here)As Mok notes above, his positive thesis is in contrast to others right now. With the 2 additional recent ratings being Holds, the stock manages to eke out a Moderate Buy consensus rating. Nevertheless, even the doubters see the shares as somewhat undervalued; the $123 average target implies shares will appreciate by 32% on the one-year horizon. (See DaVita stock forecast)Charter Communications (CHTR)For our final Buffett/Griffin-backed name, we’ll switch lanes again and turn to the telecom industry to check the details on the US’s second-largest cable operator. That’s the spiel behind Charter Communications, a company primarily known for its provision of cable television, high-speed internet, and telephone services to residential and business customers across the country.Charter’s Spectrum brand extends its services to over 32 million customers across 41 states, leveraging a vast network that covers an impressive distance of over 750,000 miles with the extensive network infrastructure and advanced technology enabling the company to deliver a wide range of digital services, including high-definition television, on-demand video, and broadband internet with competitive speeds.CHTR stock has enjoyed the spoils of 2023’s bull market, gaining 26.5% year-to-date, and that is despite missing expectations in its most recent quarterly readout. In Q2, revenue stayed roughly the same as in the year-ago period, showing a top-line of $13.66 billion, with the figure falling shy of expectations by $180 million. At the other end of the scale, EPS of $8.05 came in $0.05 below the Street’s forecast.Positively, during the quarter, Charter purchased 1.1 million shares of its stock for approximately $378 million. Ken Griffin was also busy buying shares, almost tripling his holdings to 527,699. This holding is currently worth more than $228 million. Buffett made no changes to his stack, which remains substantial. He owns 3,828,941 CHTR shares, worth a massive $1.65 billion.Wells Fargo analyst Steven Cahall is also a fan, laying out why he believes the stock represents a good investment opportunity.“We think CHTR is the clearest expression of a new normal for Cable competition,” the analyst said. “It has a strong converged bundle with Spectrum One, stable net adds due to its expansion in rural and a more aggressive video posture with programmers. We’re comfortable with ~MSD % EBITDA growth, while capex should meaningfully step-down, beginning in 2026. This makes CHTR appealing as a levered cash return story, and we think it can maintain 8-9x EV/EBITDA.”These comments underpin Cahall’s Overweight (i.e., Buy) rating on CHTR, while his $550 price target anticipates investors will be sitting on returns of 27% a year from now. (To watch Cahall’s track record, click here)Overall, of the 15 analyst reviews submitted over the past 3 months, 7 join Cahall in the bull camp and with the addition of 6 Holds and 1 Sell, the analyst consensus rates the stock a Moderate Buy. Going by the $493.31 average target, the stock’s one-year upside potential stands at 14%.

367,08d9ca9d-7bcd-3294-8a66-e1b8949d8bb4,SRE,2023-10-05,Don’t Miss the Boom: 7 Utilities Stocks Set to Explode Higher,InvestorPlace,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/don-t-miss-boom-7-002709181.html,1695947229,STORY,"['EXC', 'NIMC', 'PCG', 'NEE', 'SRE', 'DUK-PA']","[Amid a still-stubbornly high backdrop of inflation, the narrative for utilities stocks to buy stands as a cynical bright spot. Basically, everyone must pay their bills associated with core services. Otherwise, no pay, no play.Fundamentally, utilities stocks benefit from a natural monopoly. Legally speaking, an enterprise could potentially compete with a utility powerhouse. However, the barriers to entry – from the costs involved and the regulatory hoops – prevent would-be rivals from even trying. Therefore, these established giants can almost do whatever they want.Second, there’s no trade-down effect involved with utilities stocks because it’s a binary proposition. Unless you go off the grid completely, you either have the critical service or you don’t. Therefore, folks pay up because they have no choice, which bodes well for the below entities.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsDuke Energy (DUK)The logo for Duke Energy (DUK) is seen on a sign at one of the company's offices.Source: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.comA seemingly top-tier idea among utilities stocks to buy, Duke Energy (NYSE:DUK) theoretically should be performing a lot better than it has. An electric power and natural gas holding firm, Duke provides coverage to compelling regions, such as the Carolinas. With millennials increasingly moving to these places on or near the eastern coastline, Duke operates where the money is going.However, since the January opener, shares have slipped more than 13%. In the trailing one-year period, DUK lost almost 10%, which doesn’t seem congruent with its relevance. However, a look at Fintel’s options flow screener – which targets big block trades likely made by institutions – presents an encouraging canvas.While options trades in September have been decidedly bearish, the most recent transaction provides hope. Basically, a major trader (or traders) sold 10,000 contracts of the Nov 17 ’23 85.00 Put, collecting a $1.06 million premium in the process. In my opinion, that seems aggressively bullish. Also, analysts peg DUK as a moderate buy with a $99.75 target, implying nearly 11% upside potential.Story continuesExelon (EXC)The logo for Exelon (EXC) is visible at the top of an office building.Source: photosounds / Shutterstock.comHeadquartered in Chicago, Illinois, Exelon (NASDAQ:EXC) is the largest electric parent company in the U.S. by revenue, per its public profile. Given its massive footprint, one might expect EXC to perform well. However, the opposite is true. Since the beginning of this year, EXC has fallen a bit over 10%. In the past 365 days, shares have gone nowhere, dipping 2%.Adding to the worries, major options traders in this case seem bearish on Exelon. For example, on Sept. 26, a trader bought 672 contracts of the Nov 17 ’23 36.00 Put, paying a premium of nearly $27,000. On Aug. 22, a trader (or several traders) sold 2,708 contracts of the Oct 20 ’23 42.00 Put, collecting a premium of $144,716.However, the risk for the shorts is that all it takes is a rotation away from speculation and toward more reliable entities. You can’t get much more reliable than massive utilities stocks to buy. If you want to go contrarian, analysts rate EXC a strong buy with a $44.44 price target, implying 15% upside.PG&amp;E (PCG)Numerous electric lines are seen at sunset.Source: Pand P Studio / Shutterstock.comOne of the top utilities stocks, PG&amp;E (NYSE:PCG) provides electricity and natural gas service to much of Northern and Central California. Right there, PG&amp;E deserves a look for its massive relevance. Love it or hate it, the Golden State represents the economic engine of the U.S. Without California, our nation wouldn’t quite be the massive superpower that it is.Sure enough, investors seem to recognize this overwhelming catalyst. Since the start of the year, PCG gained just under 5%. That’s nothing to write home about but relatively speaking, that’s a decent run. Still, investors should be aware of some storms brewing in the derivatives market. Specifically, a major trader sold 2,601 contracts of the Nov 17 ’23 17.00 Call, collecting a $158,539 premium.While that’s distracting, keep in mind that PCG stock closed recently at $16.44. All it needs is an understanding that investors may prefer risk-off assets as opposed to risk-on. Thus, it’s possible that PCG can swing higher, blowing up this apparently bearish trade. Oh yeah, analysts rate shares a strong buy with a $19.33 price target.Sempra Energy (SRE)The logo for Sempra (SRE) is seen at the top of an office building.Source: Michael Vi / Shutterstock.comWhile Sempra Energy (NYSE:SRE) as a business doesn’t get much love from its users, it does plenty to earn the respect of shareholders. Actually, I’m not sure if that’s true in the active sense. Rather, Sempra benefits passively by covering segments of the extremely lucrative Southern California market. As stated earlier with PG&amp;E, California represents an economic powerhouse just by itself. So, SRE is one of the utilities stocks to buy.In fairness, though, it doesn’t seem that way. Since the January opener, SRE slipped almost 10%. In the past 365 days, the security gave up nearly 12% of its equity value. And sure enough, institutional traders seem pessimistic about SRE. For example, an entity sold 1,901 contracts of the Nov 17 ’23 75.00 Call on Sept. 21, collecting a nearly $230,000 premium.With SRE down at $69.41 recently, that might seem like a good trade. But Sempra’s consistent profitability could move the needle to the upside, blowing up this bear trade. Lastly, analysts peg shares as a moderate buy with an $82.15 price target, implying over 18% upside.NiSource (NI)Image of a gas burner with a blue flameSource: ShutterstockA concocting mix between speculation and opportunity, NiSource (NYSE:NI) is one of the largest fully regulated utilities stocks in the U.S. Per its public profile, NiSource services approximately 3.5 million natural gas customers and half a million electric customers across six states. That seems powerfully relevant. Unfortunately, NI shares have fallen more than 8% since the January opener.In the past 365 days, NI dipped 7.5%. And in the trailing five years, shares only gained 1%, reflecting how many investors turned to risk-on assets. Adding to the concerns for NI, major traders have been bearish. For instance, on Sept. 27, an entity (or entities) bought 6,099 contracts of the Oct 20 ’23 25.00 Put, paying a premium of $202,500.With shares trading hands at $25.18 recently, it seems this put will go in the money (ITM). However, implied volatility (IV) runs higher on the far out-the-money (OTM) calls than the OTM puts. In other words, I see a clear risk to the bears that investors will rotate toward more reliable ideas. Finally, analysts rate NI a unanimous strong buy with a $30.80 price target.American Electric Power (AEP)the American Electric Power logo is magnified on a websiteSource: Casimiro PT / Shutterstock.comA major investor-owned electric utility in the U.S., American Electric Power (NASDAQ:AEP) delivers electricity to more than five million customers in 11 states, according to its corporate profile. Also, AEP ranks among the nation’s largest generators of electricity, owning nearly 38,000 megawatts of generating capacity. Sadly, investors don’t seem to care right now.Since the January opener, AEP fell 20%. In the trailing one-year period, AEP gave up about 19% of its equity value. Since the spring doldrums of 2020, AEP has gyrated wildly across the map. In addition, the volatile swings have attracted bearish attention. Looking at Fintel’s options flow screener, the latest major transaction (Sept. 21) involved the selling of 1,000 contracts of the Oct 20 ’23 82.50 Call.Overall, the net profile seems bearish on AEP. However, it appears that the institutional options trades will expire on Oct. 20. It’s possible that without this overhang beginning the following Monday, AEP might move higher. It’s speculation, of course. Still, AEP carries a strong buy rating with a $93.38 target, implying over 23% upside potential.NextEra Energy (NEE)Environmental protection, renewable, sustainable energy sources. Plant growing in the bulb concept. renewable energy stocks to buySource: Proxima Studio / Shutterstock.comOn paper, NextEra Energy (NYSE:NEE) seems a shoo-in for utilities stocks to buy. One of the most popular companies given its focus on renewable energy, NextEra commands about 58 gigawatts (GW) of generating capacity. Per its public profile, the company is the largest electric utility holding company by market capitalization. Sadly, it’s not really looking too special in the charts.Since the start of the year, NEE fell more than 28%. Conspicuously, the security gave up nearly 12% of its equity value just in the past one-month period. And even with the decline in market value, NEE trades at a forward earnings multiple of 17.65x. That’s above the sector median of 13.94x, thus ranking worse than 82.48% of the competition.Interestingly, a major trader appears to have bought 4,110 contracts of the Jan 19 ’24 80.00 Put, paying a premium of $3.65 million. This premium represents 10.86 standard deviations above the mean, which is worrying. Still, if NEE bounces back, it could hurt the bears. Interestingly, analysts rate NEE a strong buy with an average price target of $85.46.On the date of publication, Josh Enomoto did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.A former senior business analyst for Sony Electronics, Josh Enomoto has helped broker major contracts with Fortune Global 500 companies.

Here are today's research calls that investors need to know, as compiled by The Fly. Top 5 Upgrades: Wolfe Research upgraded KeyCorp (KEY) to Peer Perform from Underperform without a price target. The firm says upside from ""higher-for-longer"" interest rates is roughly in balance with the risks associated with the bank's capital shortfall position.Citi upgraded LyondellBasell (LYB) to Buy from Neutral with a price target of $106, up from $104, ahead of the company's Q3 earnings report. The firm notes that recent run-up in oil prices has the firm ""more constructive on cyclical commodity chemical names, especially given recent selloffs.""BofA upgraded Oddity (ODD) to Buy from Neutral with a price target of $37, down from $60. The firm thinks the recent pullback in the shares presents ""an attractive buying opportunity,"" noting that the stock is 16% below its IPO price. Wolfe Research upgraded Hub Group (HUBG) to Outperform from Peer Perform with a $98 price target as part of the firm's Transport Q3 preview report. The firm sees ""a below average multiple on what we think is trough earnings,"" prompting its upgrade.Wolfe Research upgraded Matson (MATX) to Outperform from Peer Perform with a $113 price target as part of the firm's Transport Q3 preview report. The stock is ""materially outperforming,"" providing a ""bit of a better entry point,"" the firm says.Top 5 Downgrades:KeyBanc downgraded Apple (AAPL) to Sector Weight from Overweight without a price target. The firm cites valuation for the downgrade, saying Apple is trading near all-time-high multiples and a large premium to the Nasdaq versus history.Truist downgraded Sunrun (RUN) to Hold from Buy with a price target of $12, down from $30. The firm says that while the company will continue to take share given its strength in TPO financing, equity price response following Q2 results makes it clear that the market is no longer rewarding outsized growth while companies continue to compete in the ""land grab"" U.S. residential space.Truist downgraded Sunnova Energy (NOVA) to Hold from Buy with a price target of $11, down from $35, as part of a broader research note on Solar and Energy Storage ahead of the sector's Q3 results. The sector remains in a phase of valuation rationalization under which balance sheet strength and steady profitability will play an increasingly important role in equity performance, the firm says.Wolfe Research downgraded Ryder (R) to Peer Perform from Outperform without a price target as part of the firm's Q3 Transport preview. While Ryder has managed this downturn quite well so far with tailwinds from strong leasing pricing, Wolfe sees EPS risk into next year with continued muted freight demand, further downside to used truck prices, and potentially moderating leasing pricing gains.Piper Sandler downgraded B&amp;G Foods (BGS) to Underweight from Neutral with a price target of $8, down from $14, telling investors that U.S. measured retail sales trends are running behind the firm's expectations for Q3. Top 5 Initiations: UBS initiated coverage of Fiverr (FVRR) with a Buy rating and $33 price target. The company's volumes lead overall job listings by two or more quarters, and job listings have started stabilizing, the firm says.UBS initiated coverage of Upwork (UPWK) with a Neutral rating and $13 price target. While the company's total addressable market is large, its volume is strongly correlated with job listings which continues to decline, even if the decline has started moderating, the firm argues.UBS initiated coverage of ZipRecruiter (ZIP) with a Neutral rating and $13 price target. The firm says ZipRecruiter's revenues are almost perfectly correlated with job listings, which continues to decline.Stifel initiated coverage of DT Midstream (DTM) with a Buy rating and $60 price target, calling the stock ""a lower risk way to play the growth in natural gas volumes as LNG continues to grow.""TD Cowen initiated coverage of Lithium Argentina (LAAC) with an Outperform rating and $14 price target following its separation from Lithium Americas Corp. BMO Capital also resumed coverage of Lithium Argentina but with a Market Perform rating and $7.50 price target.]"

In the aforementioned survey, nurses who left direct patient care roles within the last 18 months cited feeling undervalued, overwhelming workloads, and insufficient compensation as the primary reasons for their departure.Story continuesWith the growing demand for healthcare professionals, numerous healthcare companies are taking the lead in addressing these trends.

The TSR incorporates the value of any spin-offs or discounted capital raisings, along with any dividends, based on the assumption that the dividends are reinvested. It's fair to say that the TSR gives a more complete picture for stocks that pay a dividend. We note that for Automatic Data Processing the TSR over the last 5 years was 91%, which is better than the share price return mentioned above. This is largely a result of its dividend payments!Story continuesA Different PerspectiveAutomatic Data Processing shareholders gained a total return of 4.3% during the year. But that return falls short of the market. On the bright side, the longer term returns (running at about 14% a year, over half a decade) look better. It may well be that this is a business worth popping on the watching, given the continuing positive reception, over time, from the market. Is Automatic Data Processing cheap compared to other companies? These 3 valuation measures might help you decide.Of course, you might find a fantastic investment by looking elsewhere.

If you want to see more stocks in this selection, go directly to the 5 Best Bear Market Stocks To Buy Now.The US economy successfully avoided a recession owing to its resilient job market. However, it's worth noting that the job market is usually one of the last facets to weaken when interest rates rise. A recurring pattern has emerged in such economic cycles - out of the last nine instances of Federal Reserve rate hikes, seven resulted in an economic recession. The optimism among investors regarding AI's potential to enhance productivity and drive a new phase of growth played a significant role in the stock market's recovery from the severe drop experienced in 2022, particularly in the first half of this year. Despite the Federal Reserve's decision to raise interest rates as a measure to combat inflation, the S&amp;P 500 made an impressive leap of approximately 20%, briefly touching 4600 by the end of July. For Ed Yardeni, the founder of Yardeni Research, this surge was anticipated, albeit arriving ""ahead of schedule,"" indicating an imminent short-term decline.On October 1, Yardeni reflected on his earlier analysis, stating, ""We concluded that the index might fall to its 200-day moving average, which is currently around 4200."" True to that prediction, since that point, the S&amp;P 500 has indeed experienced a decline of about 7%, reaching around 4,280 by midday on October 2. Yardeni suggests that the index could very well decline further to meet their projected 4,200 mark sometime in October. However, beyond that, he foresees a rebound in the market. In recent months, several economists have revised their growth forecasts for the third-quarter GDP, citing the labor market's resilience and strong consumer spending. The economic forecasters on the panel at the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia revised their outlook in August, now anticipating real GDP growth of 1.9% at an annual rate for the third quarter. This represents a significant increase from their initial June forecast of just 0.6%.Story continuesMost Wall Street investors, however, remain unconvinced by the stock market's gains in 2023, fearing a potential further retreat due to looming recession risks. This sentiment was revealed in the recent CNBC Delivering Alpha investor survey, which gathered opinions from approximately 300 key figures in finance, including chief investment officers, equity strategists, portfolio managers, and CNBC contributors. The survey, aimed to gauge investor outlooks on the markets for the remainder of 2023 and beyond, revealed that over 60% of respondents view this year's stock market gain as merely a temporary bounce within a bear market, foreseeing more challenges on the horizon. On the contrary, 39% of investors believe that a new bull market has already begun.As the year progresses into its latter half, the stock market is already displaying signs of the anticipated recession effects, aligning with J.P. Morgan Research's predictions. It foresees a gradual economic downturn in the United States by late 2023 due to the cautious approach taken by the Federal Reserve, resulting in stricter credit conditions that will slowly exert downward pressure on economic growth. While numerous stocks are experiencing a downward trajectory, specific industries are thriving amidst this economic strain, making their respective stocks appealing investment prospects for global investors. Some notable sectors include Utilities, Healthcare, Consumer Staples, Communication Services, DIY, and related industries. These stocks generally possess a safeguarded profitability, less susceptible to economic cycle fluctuations and changes in consumer confidence.Given the situation, investors are actively seeking out top-performing stocks during a bear market to safeguard their investments. Notably, companies such as Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (NYSE:BRK-B), Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG), and Visa Inc. (NYSE:V) are drawing the interest of investors amid the prevailing bearish trend in the markets.Most Promising Tech Stocks According to AnalystsPhoto by Adam Nowakowski on UnsplashOur MethodologyOur list for the best bear market stocks to buy is grounded in hedge fund sentiment towards each stock.

CVS has been moving its portfolio to a more value-based outcome model, and Aetna was a major move in that direction. We were willing to accept the leverage that came with the deal because CVS has a very cash generative model, and we anticipated the free cash flow would enable the company to de-lever fairly quickly.By mid-2022, CVS was in a position to use the free cash flow that had been going to debt repayment to do bolt-on deals to further prepare for the value-based outcome model and/or return more cash to shareholders in the form of higher dividends or share repurchases. However, CVS lost a “star” in its largest Medicare plan in late 2022 and this will adversely impact earnings in 2024. This was a surprise and disappointment to us, but management should be able to regain the “star” in the back half of 2023, which will then give the company a nice tailwind in 2025…” (Click here to read the full text)12.

This 250,000-square-foot retail space, which welcomed first shoppers last Saturday, is poised to significantly boost the traffic of this retail center.The opening of SCHEELS at the Chandler Fashion Center marks a significant milestone for Macerich. This 32nd SCHEELS store replaces a former department store and is roughly 100,000 square feet larger than the prior anchor.The move aligns with Macerich's regional town center strategy, which aims to provide shoppers with more than just traditional retail options. This approach has been met with resounding success as tens of thousands of shoppers flocked to SCHEELS on its opening day, boosting foot traffic at the Chandler Fashion Center by more than 108% for the day.Chandler SCHEELS offers a diverse range of experiences, including a Ferris wheel, a 16,000-gallon saltwater aquarium, a wildlife mountain, Fuzziwig’s Candy Shop, Ginna’s Café, arcade games and sports simulators.

Ed Coppola, the president of Macerich, pointed out “SCHEELS is expected to generate four times what the previous tenant generated and add significant traffic to an already strong center.” This is expected to considerably enhance the shopping center's economic viability. The boost in foot traffic is poised to benefit not only SCHEELS but also other retailers within the Fashion Center, potentially translating into higher lease revenues for MAC.Chandler Fashion Center, already a prominent retail destination, boasts a diverse lineup of more than 180 retailers, including Apple, lululemon, Dillard’s, Macy’s and more. This retail diversity, coupled with the SCHEELS addition, positions the center as a resilient and attractive investment option.In the ever-evolving landscape of retail, adaptability and innovation are the key factors for success, and Macerich has time and again demonstrated these qualities, including the transformation of Kings Plaza in Brooklyn. The recent leasing successes and targeted renovations have not only revitalized the shopping center but also positioned Macerich as a dominant player in the New York City metro area.The highlight of this transformation is the fully remerchandised former Sears space at Kings Plaza, Brooklyn's only enclosed mall. Macerich's strategic leasing decisions have attracted prominent brands, and the stores now open in the former Sears box include a three-level Target, Primark, Zara and Burlington. These new stores are poised to deliver a combined annual sales figure nearly eight times higher than the previous Sears store.The success of Kings Plaza is not solely attributable to leasing changes. Targeted renovations have also played a pivotal role. MAC's commitment to enhancing the customer experience is evident in the complete transformation of the front of Kings Plaza along Flatbush Avenue in 2018. This redevelopment included the former Sears store, and it served as a catalyst for the mall's resurgence.Dwindling footfall, store closures and retailer bankruptcies were bothering the retail real estate industry in the past, and social distancing amid the pandemic further deteriorated the fundamentals, affecting retail REITs like Macerich, Simon Property Group SPG and Federal Realty FRT, among others. However, the renewed enthusiasm of shoppers seeking exclusive in-store shopping experiences after the pandemic has revived the fundamentals of this asset category, and Macerich, Simon Property and Federal Realty remain well-poised to benefit from strategic renovations and remerchandising.Shares of this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company have risen 2.9% in the past six months against its industry’s decline of 7.8%.

385,5de0606a-bbbe-3045-ba59-64af589bf9c5,AAL,2023-10-05,What's Going On With Tesla Shares?,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/whats-going-tesla-shares-223900212.html,1696459140,STORY,"['TSLA', 'AAL', 'PPG']","[The market enjoyed a solid bounce in today’s session, with yields in retreat. It’s undoubtedly a welcomed day of price action following a few weeks of volatility.And today, there were several high-flyers on the move, including Tesla TSLA, PPG Industries PPG, and American Airlines AAL. For those interested in momentum, let’s take a closer look at what’s moving each.Tesla Tesla saw negative coverage following the release of its Q3 EV production and deliveries results despite warning investors of a planned factory shutdown in the prior earnings call. The market has seemed to shrug off the news, with bulls re-taking control of shares.Regardless, the EV leader produced over 430,000 vehicles and delivered roughly 435,000 throughout Q3, reflecting a sequential decline. Still, the company’s 2023 volume target of 1.8 million vehicles remained unchanged, undoubtedly to the likes of investors.Despite the recent bounce, Tesla shares are down roughly 9% over the last three months, providing market participants an opportunity to buy shares at discounted levels.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchKeep an eye out for the company’s upcoming quarterly release expected on October 18th, as the Zacks Consensus EPS Estimate of $0.74 suggests a 30% pullback from the year-ago period. Analysts have taken their expectations lower following the previously announced factory shutdown, with the estimate down 14% since July.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchPPG IndustriesCitigroup maintained its buy rating of PPG shares but lowered its price target to $154 per share. Regardless, the updated PT reflects 16% upside from current levels, and investors shrugged off the cut, with PPG shares seeing positive price action.Still, it’s worth noting that PPG shares have recently broken through the 200-day moving average, a level that shares previously found support.Investors will likely be better off waiting until PPG shares can clear and hold the 200-day moving average, which would reflect a meaningful change in the current trend.Story continuesZacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchIn addition, the company is expected to see solid growth in its current fiscal year (FY23), with Zacks Consensus Estimates suggesting 24% earnings growth on 3% higher sales. Peeking a bit ahead, estimates allude to an additional 12% earnings growth in FY24 paired with a 3% revenue increase.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchAmerican AirlinesAmerican Airlines shares have faced notable selling pressure over the last several months following a hot start to 2023, now flat on a year-to-date basis. The company benefitted from a boom in travel demand, but worries of impending consumer weakness have recently taken hold of shares.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchIn fact, analysts have taken their earnings expectations lower across all timeframes, further reflecting the current negative sentiment.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchThe favorable price action in today’s session likely looks to be due to a technical bounce at previous support, as we can see illustrated below. Still, the negative earnings estimate revisions the company has seen remain a critical piece of the story, likely to continue weighing on near-term share performance.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchBottom LineThe market delivered a strong performance today, with green spread across many areas following a tough stretch over last the few weeks.And throughout the session, several stocks helped lead the general market higher, including Tesla TSLA, PPG Industries PPG, and American Airlines AAL.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

For a quick overview of the 10 most visited cities in the world, read our article 10 Most Visited Cities in the World in 2023.The global tourism industry, which accounted for an estimated 10% of global GDP pre-pandemic, has shown a significant rebound in the first half of 2023, with international arrivals in the APAC region reaching 80% of pre-pandemic levels. This is partly due to a progressive reopening of international borders in 2022, which resulted in over 960 million tourists traveling internationally last year, recovering two-thirds (66%) of pre-pandemic levels. The first three months of 2023 saw an estimated 235 million international tourist arrivals, more than double the same period in 2022.The Middle East led the global tourism in 2023, with arrivals at 83% of pre-pandemic levels. Europe also rebounded strongly, welcoming 585 million visitors, or nearly 80% of its 2019 numbers. Africa and the Americas recovered about 65% of their pre-pandemic tourist arrivals, while Asia and the Pacific lagged at 23% due to strict pandemic-related restrictions.Global Travel Trends in 2023Adventure-seekers are turning to captivating TV locales for their next-big-trip inspiration. According to Expedia (NYSE:EXPE) Travel Trends Report 2023, two-thirds of global travelers have considered, and 39% have booked, destinations after seeing them on streamed shows or movies. Expedia (NYSE:EXPE) stated that this is just 2% less than advice from friends and family, the most influential source of travel inspiration. Travelers today seek spontaneous and affordable three-star hotel stays, moving away from the traditional grand expeditions. Despite having fewer stars, these hotels maintain high standards, offering excellent amenities, stylish interiors, and unique experiences, all at budget-friendly rates. They are particularly suited for last-minute or flexible travel plans. Conforming to Expedia (NYSE:EXPE) in 2023, vacation rentals now place great importance on their kitchens. The top five desired cooking amenities include outdoor kitchens or barbeques (50%), pizza ovens (25%), premium coffee machines (37%), air fryers (30%), and access to gardens with fresh produce (24%).Story continuesBooking Holdings Inc. (NASDAQ:BKNG) is one of the largest online travel agencies with a market cap of  $109.3 billion. Booking Holdings Inc.’s (NASDAQ:BKNG) Travel Predictions revealed that in 2023, nearly nine in ten travelers would be interested in a nostalgic getaway, with 23% wanting to escape to simpler times. Theme parks are a top choice for thoughtful travelers, with 61% planning to visit one in 2023. This is likely because theme parks offer a fun and carefree experience that can transport visitors back to their childhood.Furthermore, Booking Holdings Inc. (NASDAQ:BKNG) reported that multi-generational family reunions are also expected to be popular in 2023, with 54% of travelers planning to take one. Theme parks are ideal for family reunions, as they offer something for everyone of all ages.American Airlines Group Inc. (NASDAQ:AAL), the world's largest airline, operates a vast network of international and domestic flights, as well as regional flights through its regional partners. It is renowned for its extensive reach and reliable service. American Airlines Group Inc. (NASDAQ:AAL) reported record quarterly revenues of $14.1 billion in the second quarter of 2023, driven by continued strong demand and operational performance. The company also raised its profit outlook for the third quarter, citing positive demand trends and a favorable fuel price forecast.Tourism Trends in China in 2023China's tourism sector was poised for a strong comeback in 2023 despite the significant impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic. Domestic tourism revenue is projected to exceed RMB 4 trillion (approximately US$580.96 billion), a 96% increase from 2022. Both outbound and inbound tourism markets have shown impressive vitality in the first half of 2023, surpassing 2019 levels. Average expenditures for outbound travelers have increased significantly, with Hong Kong and Macao leading the resurgence. The total number of inbound and outbound individuals has surged by 170%.According to Forbes, just a few years ago, the United States saw an influx of approximately 3 million Chinese tourists annually, making a significant contribution of over $30 billion to the US economy. Back in 2019, even though Chinese visitors represented just 4% of all foreign travelers coming to the US, they made up a striking 13% of the total spending. However, in the current year of 2023, the landscape has changed considerably, with projections indicating that the number of Chinese tourists visiting the US is expected to drop to fewer than 850,000. China lifts group travel restrictions to the US. Lifting travel restrictions is a positive development for the US tourism industry, which has been struggling to recover from the pandemic. If Chinese tourist arrivals can return to pre-pandemic levels, it would significantly boost the US economy.40 most visited cities in the world in 2023Kamira/Shutterstock.comMethodologyWe scoured the internet to find out the most popular travel destinations.

It is calculated based on three factors: historical multiples (PE Ratio, PS Ratio, PB Ratio, and Price-to-Free-Cash-Flow) that the stock has traded at, GuruFocus adjustment factor based on the company's past returns and growth, and future estimates of the business performance.Is American Airlines Group (AAL) Too Good to Be True? A Comprehensive Analysis of a Potential Value TrapUnderstanding the Risks: A Closer Look at American Airlines GroupDespite its seemingly attractive valuation, certain risk factors associated with American Airlines Group should not be ignored. These risks are primarily reflected through its low Altman Z-score of 0.87, and the company's revenues and earnings have been on a downward trend over the past five years.Decoding the Altman Z-ScoreBefore delving into the details, let's understand what the Altman Z-score entails. Invented by New York University Professor Edward I. Altman in 1968, the Z-Score is a financial model that predicts the probability of a company entering bankruptcy within a two-year time frame. The Altman Z-Score combines five different financial ratios, each weighted to create a final score. A score below 1.8 suggests a high likelihood of financial distress, while a score above 3 indicates a low risk.A Snapshot of American Airlines GroupAmerican Airlines Group is the world's largest airline by aircraft, capacity, and scheduled revenue passenger miles. Its major U.S. hubs are Charlotte, Chicago, Dallas/Fort Worth, Los Angeles, Miami, New York, Philadelphia, Phoenix, and Washington, D.C. It generates over 30% of U.S. airline revenue connecting Latin America with destinations in the United States. After completing a major fleet renewal, the company has the youngest fleet of U.S. legacy carriers.Story continuesIs American Airlines Group (AAL) Too Good to Be True? A Comprehensive Analysis of a Potential Value TrapUnpacking American Airlines Group's Low Altman Z-ScoreA dissection of American Airlines Group's Altman Z-score reveals American Airlines Group's financial health may be weak, suggesting possible financial distress. The Retained Earnings to Total Assets ratio provides insights into a company's capability to reinvest its profits or manage debt. Evaluating American Airlines Group's historical data, 2021: -0.11; 2022: -0.14; 2023: -0.11, we observe a declining trend in this ratio. This downward movement indicates American Airlines Group's diminishing ability to reinvest in its business or effectively manage its debt. Consequently, it exerts a negative impact on its Z-Score.The Bearish Signs: Declining Revenues and EarningsOne of the telltale indicators of a company's potential trouble is a sustained decline in revenues. In the case of American Airlines Group, both the revenue per share (evident from the last five years' TTM data: 2019: 98.91; 2020: 76.68; 2021: 30.98; 2022: 59.35; 2023: 76.58; ) and the 5-year revenue growth rate (-10.7%) have been on a consistent downward trajectory. This pattern may point to underlying challenges such as diminishing demand for American Airlines Group's products, or escalating competition in its market sector. Either scenario can pose serious risks to the company's future performance, warranting a thorough analysis by investors.Is American Airlines Group (AAL) Too Good to Be True? A Comprehensive Analysis of a Potential Value TrapThe Red Flag: Sluggish Earnings GrowthThe company's earnings picture does not look much brighter. The 3-year EPS without NRI growth rate (-63.1%) is sluggish, and the future 3 to 5-year EPS growth estimate (66.42%) does not show a promising uptick. These indicators could suggest the company is struggling to translate sales into profits effectively, a critical element of a successful business model.Conclusion: A Potential Value Trap?Despite its low price-to-fair-value ratio, American Airlines Group's falling revenues and earnings cast a long shadow over its investment attractiveness. A low price relative to intrinsic value can indeed suggest an investment opportunity, but only if the company's fundamentals are sound or improving. In Steelcase's case, the declining revenues, EBITDA, and earnings growth suggest that the company's issues may be more than just cyclical fluctuations. Without a clear turnaround strategy, there's a risk that the company's performance could continue to deteriorate, leading to further price declines. In such a scenario, the low price-to-GF-Value ratio may be more indicative of a value trap than a value opportunity.GuruFocus Premium members can find stocks with high Altman Z-Score using the following Screener: Walter Schloss Screen .Investors can find stocks with good revenue and earnings growth using GuruFocus' Peter Lynch Growth with Low Valuation Screener.This article first appeared on GuruFocus.]"

""It's what you do once you feel it.""Learning to harness self-doubt and use it to her advantage is what has helped Lamarque get comfortable with the uncomfortable-and what ultimately led her to the role of executive vice president and general counsel and secretary at Principal®.Evaluating risks-and harnessing fearsGrowing up in New York City as a child of Haitian immigrants, Lamarque watched her parents face uncertainty head on.""You see people handle really difficult situations with confidence,"" Lamarque says about her parents. ""I'm just wired differently because I grew up with them as role models.""Escaping dictatorship in 1970s after migrating to the U.S., Lamarque's father pursued a career as an accountant. Her mother rose in the ranks as an OGBYN and ultimately ran the obstetrics and gynecology department for New York University hospitals, facing life or death situations every day.Lamarque's father also had a keen interest in law. It was the lawyers in Haiti, after all, who fought for government reform, despite the very real risks. Though his pursuit of a law degree was cut short, he passed down his passion. In the Lamarque household, democracy was never taken for granted-and politics, law, and civics were routine topics of discussion. A deep respect for all three grew in Lamarque, and ultimately led her to pursue a career in law.Story continuesDespite her passion for the job, it did not come without its challenges. Early in her career as a trial lawyer, Lamarque remembers the uncomfortable sensations that flooded her every time she stood up to make an opening statement: A racing heart. Butterflies in her stomach. Pounding in her ears.And although inherently risk averse, Lamarque was never satisfied staying in her comfort zone.""You learn to compose yourself and focus through it,"" Lamarque says. ""You learn to prepare and study more."" And, she adds, you learn to stop fighting your feelings but rather lean into them.""And every time you do, the muscle grows and so does your confidence,"" she says. ""The amount of fear and apprehension decreases and the length of time it takes you to get over that concern shortens.""Building a support systemAll the techniques Lamarque has learned, she emphasizes, come from the network she's built over the years. It was this support system that helped her find the courage to move across the country to join Principal in 2022.""I called on an entire cabinet of people-my husband, my children, my parents, mentors, sponsors, other general counsels, and CEOs who have made similar moves themselves,"" Lamarque says.Leaning on people she can be honest and vulnerable with in times of change is key. But nothing has given her perspective like supporting and mentoring others.It's what she spends a lot of her time doing as general counsel: Ensuring Principal has top talent and then providing the support and guidance they need to feel connected to the mission of the company and do their best work.""You cannot get perspective if you stay in your own box and all you're thinking about is you,"" Lamarque says. ""And you're only talking to other people who look like you, think like you, have the same experiences you have.""It's going to make you see small things as big things and big things as small things, because you need diversity of opinions and perspectives to really understand what you're looking at.""Simply put, Lamarque says, ""I don't believe anyone succeeds alone.

This 250,000-square-foot retail space, which welcomed first shoppers last Saturday, is poised to significantly boost the traffic of this retail center.The opening of SCHEELS at the Chandler Fashion Center marks a significant milestone for Macerich. This 32nd SCHEELS store replaces a former department store and is roughly 100,000 square feet larger than the prior anchor.The move aligns with Macerich's regional town center strategy, which aims to provide shoppers with more than just traditional retail options. This approach has been met with resounding success as tens of thousands of shoppers flocked to SCHEELS on its opening day, boosting foot traffic at the Chandler Fashion Center by more than 108% for the day.Chandler SCHEELS offers a diverse range of experiences, including a Ferris wheel, a 16,000-gallon saltwater aquarium, a wildlife mountain, Fuzziwig’s Candy Shop, Ginna’s Café, arcade games and sports simulators. This is in addition to 75 specialty shops set inside the sporting goods retailer.For investors eyeing Macerich, the addition of SCHEELS at the Chandler Fashion Center represents a promising opportunity. Ed Coppola, the president of Macerich, pointed out “SCHEELS is expected to generate four times what the previous tenant generated and add significant traffic to an already strong center.” This is expected to considerably enhance the shopping center's economic viability. The boost in foot traffic is poised to benefit not only SCHEELS but also other retailers within the Fashion Center, potentially translating into higher lease revenues for MAC.Chandler Fashion Center, already a prominent retail destination, boasts a diverse lineup of more than 180 retailers, including Apple, lululemon, Dillard’s, Macy’s and more. This retail diversity, coupled with the SCHEELS addition, positions the center as a resilient and attractive investment option.In the ever-evolving landscape of retail, adaptability and innovation are the key factors for success, and Macerich has time and again demonstrated these qualities, including the transformation of Kings Plaza in Brooklyn. The recent leasing successes and targeted renovations have not only revitalized the shopping center but also positioned Macerich as a dominant player in the New York City metro area.The highlight of this transformation is the fully remerchandised former Sears space at Kings Plaza, Brooklyn's only enclosed mall. Macerich's strategic leasing decisions have attracted prominent brands, and the stores now open in the former Sears box include a three-level Target, Primark, Zara and Burlington. These new stores are poised to deliver a combined annual sales figure nearly eight times higher than the previous Sears store.The success of Kings Plaza is not solely attributable to leasing changes. Targeted renovations have also played a pivotal role. MAC's commitment to enhancing the customer experience is evident in the complete transformation of the front of Kings Plaza along Flatbush Avenue in 2018. This redevelopment included the former Sears store, and it served as a catalyst for the mall's resurgence.Dwindling footfall, store closures and retailer bankruptcies were bothering the retail real estate industry in the past, and social distancing amid the pandemic further deteriorated the fundamentals, affecting retail REITs like Macerich, Simon Property Group SPG and Federal Realty FRT, among others. However, the renewed enthusiasm of shoppers seeking exclusive in-store shopping experiences after the pandemic has revived the fundamentals of this asset category, and Macerich, Simon Property and Federal Realty remain well-poised to benefit from strategic renovations and remerchandising.Shares of this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company have risen 2.9% in the past six months against its industry’s decline of 7.8%.

This acquisition will add nearly 3,800 customers to the company’s customer base.Timely repairs and maintenance of aging water and wastewater infrastructure are essential to providing high-quality 24x7 services to customers. As part of the acquisition deal, New Jersey American Water plans to invest more than $9.5 million to upgrade the aging sewer infrastructure of the Borough of Somerville in the next ten years to provide high-quality sewer services to customers.New Jersey American Water has been expanding its sewer service business in the state through systematic acquisitions. This latest acquisition is its fourth sewer system acquisition within the company’s water footprint in the last five years, adding more than 11,300 new wastewater customers.Aging Wastewater Industry Needs Investments &amp; ConsolidationThe aging of wastewater infrastructure and delays in essential upgrades are concerns for the sewer service industry. Per the American Society of Civil Engineers (ASCE), at present, nearly 16,000 wastewater treatment systems in the United States are providing water solutions to customers. Some of the service providers are too small and have limited financial strength to carry out the essential, costly repairs on time, which leads to pipeline breakage and disruption of services and increases the possibility of contamination.Fragmentation in the water and wastewater industry is a headwind. Large water utility companies continue to acquire small players to ensure the extension of high-quality services to customers and the investments required to upgrade old and acquired assets.Per the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, an investment of nearly $271 billion is necessary to maintain and expand wastewater services to meet demand over the next 20 years.American Water Works, through its subsidiaries, is making systematic acquisitions and taking essential steps to upgrade the old infrastructure of its acquired assets. AWK has added 7,100 customers till Jun 30, 2023, by acquiring five companies.

In addition, AWK has long-term investment plans to upgrade and expand its water infrastructure and serve customers efficiently.California Water Service Group CWT, is also expanding operations through inorganic routes.

(NASDAQ:PEP)",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/estimating-intrinsic-value-pepsico-inc-120049078.html,1696507249,STORY,['PEP'],"[Key InsightsPepsiCo's estimated fair value is US$203 based on 2 Stage Free Cash Flow to EquityWith US$169 share price, PepsiCo appears to be trading close to its estimated fair value Analyst price target for PEP is US$195 which is 4.0% below our fair value estimateToday we will run through one way of estimating the intrinsic value of PepsiCo, Inc. (NASDAQ:PEP) by taking the expected future cash flows and discounting them to today's value. This will be done using the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model. There's really not all that much to it, even though it might appear quite complex.We generally believe that a company's value is the present value of all of the cash it will generate in the future. However, a DCF is just one valuation metric among many, and it is not without flaws. Anyone interested in learning a bit more about intrinsic value should have a read of the Simply Wall St analysis model. View our latest analysis for PepsiCo Step By Step Through The CalculationWe are going to use a two-stage DCF model, which, as the name states, takes into account two stages of growth. The first stage is generally a higher growth period which levels off heading towards the terminal value, captured in the second 'steady growth' period. In the first stage we need to estimate the cash flows to the business over the next ten years. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.A DCF is all about the idea that a dollar in the future is less valuable than a dollar today, so we discount the value of these future cash flows to their estimated value in today's dollars:Story continues10-year free cash flow (FCF) forecast2024202520262027202820292030203120322033 Levered FCF ($, Millions) US$9.88bUS$10.5bUS$11.2bUS$11.7bUS$12.1bUS$12.4bUS$12.8bUS$13.1bUS$13.4bUS$13.7bGrowth Rate Estimate SourceAnalyst x5Analyst x3Analyst x1Analyst x1Est @ 3.30%Est @ 2.96%Est @ 2.71%Est @ 2.55%Est @ 2.43%Est @ 2.34% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 6.2% US$9.3kUS$9.3kUS$9.4kUS$9.2kUS$9.0kUS$8.7kUS$8.4kUS$8.1kUS$7.8kUS$7.6k(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$87bAfter calculating the present value of future cash flows in the initial 10-year period, we need to calculate the Terminal Value, which accounts for all future cash flows beyond the first stage. For a number of reasons a very conservative growth rate is used that cannot exceed that of a country's GDP growth. In this case we have used the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield (2.2%) to estimate future growth. In the same way as with the 10-year 'growth' period, we discount future cash flows to today's value, using a cost of equity of 6.2%.Terminal Value (TV)= FCF2033 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$14b× (1 + 2.2%) ÷ (6.2%– 2.2%) = US$350bPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$350b÷ ( 1 + 6.2%)10= US$193bThe total value, or equity value, is then the sum of the present value of the future cash flows, which in this case is US$280b. The last step is to then divide the equity value by the number of shares outstanding. Relative to the current share price of US$169, the company appears about fair value at a 17% discount to where the stock price trades currently. Remember though, that this is just an approximate valuation, and like any complex formula - garbage in, garbage out.dcfThe AssumptionsNow the most important inputs to a discounted cash flow are the discount rate, and of course, the actual cash flows. Part of investing is coming up with your own evaluation of a company's future performance, so try the calculation yourself and check your own assumptions. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at PepsiCo as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 6.2%, which is based on a levered beta of 0.800. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.SWOT Analysis for PepsiCoStrengthDebt is well covered by earnings and cashflows.WeaknessEarnings declined over the past year.Dividend is low compared to the top 25% of dividend payers in the Beverage market.OpportunityAnnual earnings are forecast to grow for the next 3 years.Current share price is below our estimate of fair value.ThreatDividends are not covered by cash flow.Annual earnings are forecast to grow slower than the American market.Looking Ahead:Although the valuation of a company is important, it ideally won't be the sole piece of analysis you scrutinize for a company. DCF models are not the be-all and end-all of investment valuation. Instead the best use for a DCF model is to test certain assumptions and theories to see if they would lead to the company being undervalued or overvalued. For instance, if the terminal value growth rate is adjusted slightly, it can dramatically alter the overall result.

We also reviewed year to date performance of 15 stocks billionaire Seth Klarman likes the most now. You can skip our detailed discussion about Seth Klarman and jump directly to 5 Stocks Billionaire Seth Klarman Likes the Most Now.When the S&amp;P 500 was trading at a 52-week high two months ago, billionaire Seth Klarman, a renowned value investor and founder of Baupost Group, predicted that the markets were still in a bubble caused by ultra-low interest rates during pandemic years. His prediction is turning out to be true as the S&amp;P 500 has plunged nearly 7% since Klarman presented a bearish outlook for the US stock market in an interview with Ted Seides of Capital Allocators. The robust uptrend of the US stock market has been halted by the Fed's hawkish stance, an increase in inflation, and lofty valuations.""You had a bubble, it was really a credit bubble, that became an everything bubble. Super-low interest rates, at times zero rates, made capital easily available and incredibly cheap. That led to startup manias and SPACs and meme stocks and crypto, all kinds of speculative activity. I'm not convinced that we've even begun to sort out that bubble,"" the billionaire investor said in an interview with Capital Allocators. After reaching a 2023 high of 4500 points in July and surging 19%, the broader US stock market index fell back to 4200 points in the following two months as investor sentiment was harmed by the Fed's strategy of keeping rates higher for longer in order to keep inflation at 2%. According to the Fed's dot plot, there will be one more rate hike in 2023 and two fewer cuts in 2024, compared to expectations for no rate hikes in 2023 and four cuts in 2024. High interest rates already jolted the financial sector in early 2023, when several regional banks failed. The Fed's strategy of keeping rates higher for a longer time would exacerbate difficulties for the financial sector. Higher rates for a longer time will support deposit flight to market funds with higher yields. High rates also deter the growth potential of the technology and other growth sectors. Story continuesIn another interview following the publication of his edited version of Benjamin Graham's and David Dodd's Security Analysis, widely regarded as the bible of value investing, Klarman advised retail and institutional investors to revisit Security Analysis. He explained in an interview that he edited the book to emphasize how crucial it is to abide by fundamental principles of investing in order to avoid volatility. He added that it is his duty to alert investors about the risks because speculative trading has gained significant traction in the last 15 years. He does, however, think that the largest endowments and pension funds might choose to ignore his advice.“I don’t know how much of this will be read by institutional investors who may think they know it all.”Seth Klarman's investment strategy and principles are worth considering because he grew his small $27 million fund into one of the world's largest hedge funds, earning a compound annual average return of 20% since inception. His hedge fund's stellar performance earned him the title ""the Oracle of Boston."" In fact, Warren Buffett of Berkshire Hathaway once said that one book he reads almost daily is Seth Klarman's ""Margin of Safety."" Klarman’s hedge fund mainly invests in stocks, distressed debt, and foreign securities. The renowned investor typically looks for undervalued securities and then he waits for the price to increase with a long-term horizon. According to the Baupost Group's second quarter 13F Filings, billionaire Seth Klarman's $5.6 billion stock portfolio underwent a number of changes. His fund added four new positions while increasing or decreasing the number of its existing positions. Additionally, the hedge fund unloaded six stocks. The Baupost Group's stock portfolio is well-diversified, with stocks primarily from the communication, technology, healthcare, industrial, and financial sectors. The fund’s largest stock holdings include Union Pacific Corporation (NYSE:UNP), Dollar General Corporation (NYSE:DG), Jazz Pharmaceuticals plc (NASDAQ:JAZZ), Amazon.com, Inc.

Additionally, we saw the negative impacts of lower-than-expected tax refunds and reductions in the Federal Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP). Dollar General remained committed to spending on customer experience and investing in price to help their customers through the tougher economic environment, as a result, reducing the earnings guidance by a greater amount than the sales reductions.”8.

New Oriental Education &amp; Technology Group Inc. (NYSE:EDU) Value of Baupost Group’s 13F Position: $162 million Number of Hedge Fund Shareholders: 26So far in 2023, billionaire Seth Klarman’s Baupost Group benefited from its stake in New Oriental Education &amp; Technology Group Inc.

(NYSE:EDU): We made a new investment in New Oriental last fall. Outside of one-on-one discussions with some partners, I’ve never discussed the investment in-depth before. The reason for this is that I simply because thought there wasn’t much to say.The thesis at the time was extremely simple – the company was trading below the net cash value on its balance sheet, while I believed the on-going operations would soon return to profitable growth. As such, I believed the market was being overly pessimistic about the company’s future prospects, and the shares would re-value once the on-going education business returned to a surer financial footing.Partners will notice that unlike a typical Hayden investment, this is more emblematic of a “special-situations” / event-driven thesis. Our thesis is dependent upon a specific catalyst &amp; subsequent change in the market’s perception, more so than the longer-term attractiveness of the company’s operations. I expect our holding period will be shorter than our typical investments, for this reason…” (Click here to read the full text)5. Garrett Motion Inc.

An In-Depth Exploration,GuruFocus.com,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/gap-gps-true-worth-overpriced-163547249.html,1696437347,STORY,['GPS'],"[Gap Inc (NYSE:GPS) has shown a considerable gain of 2.78% today and a 19.55% increase over the past three months. With an Earnings Per Share (EPS) of 0.29, the question arises: is the stock modestly undervalued? This article seeks to answer this question by conducting an in-depth valuation analysis of Gap (NYSE:GPS). Read on for a comprehensive exploration of Gap's intrinsic value.Company OverviewWarning! GuruFocus has detected 6 Warning Sign with GPS. Click here to check it out. GPS 30-Year Financial DataThe intrinsic value of GPSGap Inc, founded in 1969, is a leading retailer of apparel, accessories, and personal-care products. The company operates under the Gap, Old Navy, Banana Republic, and Athleta brands, with Old Navy generating more than half of Gap's sales. Gap operates approximately 2,600 stores in North America, Europe, and Asia and franchises about 850 more in other regions. Despite a current stock price of $10.53, the GF Value estimates the fair value at $13.91, suggesting that Gap (NYSE:GPS) might be modestly undervalued.Gap (GPS)'s True Worth: Is It Overpriced? An In-Depth ExplorationUnderstanding GF ValueThe GF Value is a unique measure of a stock's intrinsic value. It is calculated based on three factors: historical multiples, a GuruFocus adjustment factor, and future business performance estimates. The GF Value Line gives an overview of the fair value that the stock should ideally be traded at. If the stock price is significantly above the GF Value Line, it is overvalued and its future return is likely to be poor. Conversely, if it is significantly below the GF Value Line, its future return will likely be higher.According to GuruFocus Value calculation, Gap (NYSE:GPS) appears to be modestly undervalued. This implies that the long-term return of its stock is likely to be higher than its business growth, given the current price of $10.53 per share and the market cap of $3.90 billion.Gap (GPS)'s True Worth: Is It Overpriced? An In-Depth ExplorationLink: These companies may deliever higher future returns at reduced risk.Story continuesFinancial Strength AnalysisBefore investing in a company, it is crucial to assess its financial strength. Companies with poor financial strength pose a higher risk of permanent loss. The cash-to-debt ratio and interest coverage are key indicators of a company's financial strength. Gap's cash-to-debt ratio of 0.24 ranks lower than 64.18% of 1097 companies in the Retail - Cyclical industry, indicating fair financial strength.Gap (GPS)'s True Worth: Is It Overpriced? An In-Depth ExplorationProfitability and GrowthInvesting in profitable companies, particularly those with consistent profitability over the long term, poses less risk. Gap has been profitable 8 out of the past 10 years, with a revenue of $15.10 billion and an Earnings Per Share (EPS) of $0.29 in the past twelve months. However, its operating margin of 1.67% ranks lower than 61.66% of 1111 companies in the Retail - Cyclical industry.Growth is a crucial factor in a company's valuation. A faster-growing company creates more value for shareholders, especially if the growth is profitable. However, Gap's 3-year average annual revenue growth of -0.6% and EBITDA growth rate of -24.3% rank lower than most companies in the Retail - Cyclical industry.ROIC vs WACCComparing a company's return on invested capital (ROIC) to the weighted average cost of capital (WACC) can also indicate its profitability. ROIC measures how well a company generates cash flow relative to the capital it has invested in its business. WACC is the rate that a company is expected to pay on average to all its security holders to finance its assets. If the ROIC is higher than the WACC, the company is creating value for shareholders. For the past 12 months, Gap's ROIC is 1.57, and its WACC is 7.08.Gap (GPS)'s True Worth: Is It Overpriced? An In-Depth ExplorationConclusionIn conclusion, the stock of Gap (NYSE:GPS) shows every sign of being modestly undervalued. The company's financial condition is fair, and its profitability is fair.
