When analyzing insider transactions, it is usually more valuable to know whether insiders are buying versus knowing if they are selling, as the latter sends an ambiguous message. However, if numerous insiders are selling, shareholders should investigate more.Although we don't think shareholders should simply follow insider transactions, we do think it is perfectly logical to keep tabs on what insiders are doing. See our latest analysis for Charles Schwab The Last 12 Months Of Insider Transactions At Charles SchwabIn the last twelve months, the biggest single sale by an insider was when the Founder &amp; Co-Chairman, Charles Schwab, sold US$19m worth of shares at a price of US$69.43 per share. That means that even when the share price was below the current price of US$78.26, an insider wanted to cash in some shares. When an insider sells below the current price, it suggests that they considered that lower price to be fair. That makes us wonder what they think of the (higher) recent valuation. However, while insider selling is sometimes discouraging, it's only a weak signal. We note that the biggest single sale was only 0.2% of Charles Schwab's holding.In total, Charles Schwab insiders sold more than they bought over the last year. You can see the insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last year depicted in the chart below. If you want to know exactly who sold, for how much, and when, simply click on the graph below!insider-trading-volumeI will like Charles Schwab better if I see some big insider buys. While we wait, check out this free list of growing companies with considerable, recent, insider buying.Insiders At Charles Schwab Have Sold Stock RecentlyThe last three months saw significant insider selling at Charles Schwab. In total, insiders sold US$46m worth of shares in that time, and we didn't record any purchases whatsoever. This may suggest that some insiders think that the shares are not cheap.Story continuesInsider OwnershipI like to look at how many shares insiders own in a company, to help inform my view of how aligned they are with insiders. Usually, the higher the insider ownership, the more likely it is that insiders will be incentivised to build the company for the long term. It's great to see that Charles Schwab insiders own 6.4% of the company, worth about US$9.3b. Most shareholders would be happy to see this sort of insider ownership, since it suggests that management incentives are well aligned with other shareholders.So What Does This Data Suggest About Charles Schwab Insiders?Insiders sold Charles Schwab shares recently, but they didn't buy any. Zooming out, the longer term picture doesn't give us much comfort. On the plus side, Charles Schwab makes money, and is growing profits. While insiders do own a lot of shares in the company (which is good), our analysis of their transactions doesn't make us feel confident about the company. So these insider transactions can help us build a thesis about the stock, but it's also worthwhile knowing the risks facing this company. Every company has risks, and we've spotted 1 warning sign for Charles Schwab you should know about.Of course Charles Schwab may not be the best stock to buy.

Then you must be worried about the recent 50 basis point hike in the benchmark interest rate this week by the Federal Reserve and the indication that the rates might be kept higher for an extended period of time.However, rather than worrying, a focus on the unique feature of this distinct asset class can fetch you a steady income and help to survive market volatility.In fact, with the roller coaster ride in the stock market this year — thanks to high inflation and a quick rise in interest rates that is weighing on asset prices — the focus has now shifted to investing in quality companies with a consistent track of paying dividends. Obviously, this brings us to the REITs because solid dividend payouts are arguably the biggest enticements for REIT investors.Income-seeking investors still have a large appetite for REIT stocks, as U.S. law requires REITs to distribute 90% of their annual taxable income in the form of dividends. This has enabled the industry to stand out and gain a footing over the last 15-20 years.Ushering in good news for investors, particularly income-seeking ones, recently, a number of REITs declared their dividend hikes. Among them are Realty Income Corp., Alexandria Real Estate Equities, Inc. and Mid-America Apartment Communities, Inc..Story continuesWhat's more to drive you to invest in REITs?What's more encouraging is REITs' characteristic of providing natural protection against inflation. Particularly, both rents and real estate values have a tendency to move north with prices increasing, thereby aiding dividend growth.This hybrid asset class not only provides protection against inflation but also benefits from the improving fundamentals of the underlying asset categories as well as the location of properties. In fact, with the waning of the pandemic-related concerns, REITs, which invest in all types of properties, from residential, industrial, offices and malls to hospitals, hotels, data centers and several others, are experiencing an improvement in a number of these asset categories.Also, according to the third-quarter data from the Nareit Total REIT Industry Tracker Series (T-Tracker) report, even amid a period of high inflation as well as rising rates, REITs' operational performance exhibited strength with 14.9% and 8.1% year-over-year increases in funds from operations and net operating income, respectively.As REITs continue to experience earnings growth, this special hybrid asset class remains well-positioned to deliver a decent stream of dividend income to investors.Now, if REITs' historical dependence on debt makes investors skeptical in a rising rate environment, it needs to be noted that over the years, REITs have managed their balance sheets efficiently and are now well prepared for a rising rate environment. Instead of looking for debt to finance the portfolios, these companies have strategically resorted to equity capital over the past decade.Let's discuss these REIT stocks in detail:Headquartered in San Diego, CA, Realty Income is engaged in the acquisition and management of freestanding commercial properties that reap rental revenues under long-term net lease agreements with commercial clients. This Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock has a market cap of $40.54 billion.

Delighting its shareholders, the company will now pay out 24.85 cents per share in dividend compared with the 24.80 cents paid earlier.The increased dividend will be paid out on Jan 13 to shareholders on record as of Jan 3, 2023.

The company increased its dividend 24 times in the past 5 years, and its payout has grown 2.98% over the same time period.

It derives more than 90% of its annualized retail contractual rental revenues from tenants with a service, non-discretionary and a low-price-point component to their business.Such businesses are less susceptible to economic recessions and competition from Internet retailing and provide more reliable streams of income. Realty Income maintains high occupancy levels consistently, and its diversified tenant base, accretive buyouts and robust balance sheet bode well for its growth.Pasadena, CA-based Alexandria Real Estate Equities, Inc. is an office REIT, focusing particularly on collaborative life science, agtech and technology campuses. This Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock has a market cap of $24.68 billion.On Dec 5, Alexandria Real Estate announced a 2.5% sequential hike in its fourth-quarter 2022 cash dividend payout. Alexandria will now pay out a dividend of $1.21 per share, up from the $1.18 paid out in the third quarter. The increased dividend will be paid out on Jan 13, 2023 to shareholders on record as of Dec 30, 2022.Based on the increased rate, the annual dividend comes to $4.84 per share. For the year ending Dec 31, 2022, the common stock dividend marks an increase of 24 cents or 5% year over year.ARE currently pays investors $4.72 per share, or 3.14%, on an annual basis. The company increased its dividend 11 times in the past 5 years, and its payout has grown 6.11% over the same time period. This is attractive to income investors and represents a steady income stream. Moreover, Alexandria's current payout ratio is 57%. Check Alexandria's dividend history here.The high demand for ARE's Class A properties in AAA locations is boosting the level of occupancy and driving growth in rents. The company is witnessing strong demand for space in key life science markets.Moreover, Alexandria has adequate financial flexibility to enhance its market position and capitalize on long-term growth opportunities. Looking at the company's solid operating platform, balance sheet strength, ability to generate cash flows and payout ratio, it is likely to be able to sustain the hiked dividend.Mid-America Apartment Communities, also known as MAA and based in Germantown, TN, is engaged in owning, managing, acquiring, developing and redeveloping quality apartment communities, mainly in the Southeast, Southwest and Mid-Atlantic regions of the United States. This Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock has a market cap of $19.13 billion.On Dec 13, MAA's board of directors approved an increase in the company's quarterly dividend payment. The company will now pay out $1.40 per share, which reflects a hike of 12% from the prior dividend of $1.25.Based on the increased rate, the annual dividend comes to $5.60 per share, denoting an increase of 60 cents per share from the prior dividend level. The new dividend will be paid out on Jan 31, 2023 to shareholders of record as of Jan 13, 2023. MAA has delivered 13 years of consecutive dividend increases.MAA currently pays investors $5.00 per share, or 3.10%, on an annual basis. The company increased its dividend 7 times in the past 5 years, and its payout has grown 4.95% over the same time period. MAA's payout ratio currently sits at 62% of earnings. Check Mid-America Apartment's dividend history here.MAA's diversified Sunbelt portfolio of suburban-focused communities was less severely affected by the pandemic and the economic shutdown. The pandemic accelerated employment shifts and population inflow into the company's markets as renters sought more business-friendly, lower-taxed and low-density cities.Amid these, MAA is poised to capture recovery in demand and leasing compared with expensive coastal markets. MAA's current cash flow growth is projected at 39.17% compared with 14.86% growth projected for the industry. Looking at its lower dividend payout (compared to its industry), it seems that its dividend distribution is expected to be sustainable.Note: Anything related to earnings presented in this write-up represents funds from operations (FFO) — a widely used metric to gauge the performance of REITs.Why Haven't You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?

The industry has gained 2.5% year to date. Improved pricing, prudent underwriting, increased exposure, streamlined operations, a wider global presence and a solid capital position have helped the industry.Banking on strong fundamentals and benefiting from a favorable macro backdrop, W.R. Berkley Corporation WRB, Unum Group UNM and Kinsale Capital Group Inc. KNSL have not only outperformed the industry but have also crushed the market and the Finance sector. These companies are well-poised to sustain the bull run next year. Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment Research What Helped the Insurers Sail Through This Year?The economy has been growing slowly, as evident from the GDP that increased at an annualized rate of 2.9% in the third quarter of 2022. Per December Economic Projections of the Fed, GDP in 2022 is estimated to improve 0.5%, while the unemployment rate is expected to be 3.7%.Despite an above-average hurricane season, continued increases in pricing, reinsurance programs and favorable reserve development helped non-life insurers sail through.Swiss Re estimated insured losses from natural catastrophes of $35 million for the first half of 2022, while Munich Re estimated losses of $65 billion, with slightly less than half insured. Per a report published in LAW360, AM Best estimated the net income of U.S. property and casualty insurers to decline 17% year over year to $31.4 billion in the first half of 2022.Global commercial insurance prices rose for 20 straight quarters though the magnitude slowed down over the last seven quarters, per Marsh Global Insurance Market Index.Better pricing ensures improved premiums and prudent claims payment. Per Deloitte Insights, gross premiums are estimated to increase sixfold to $722 billion by 2030. China and North America should account for more than two-thirds of the global market, per the report. Per Willis Towers Watson’s 2021 Insurance Marketplace Realities spring update report, except for one, 26 lines should witness a price rise, while seven lines should witness a mix or flat increase.The insurance industry is rate sensitive. The interest rate environment has started to improve. The Fed has already made six hikes in 2022, with more to come. An improving rate environment is a boon for insurers, especially long-tail non-life insurers and life insurers.Increased awareness following the pandemic continues to support the life insurance market. However, according to LIMRA's Second Quarter U.S. Individual Life Insurance Sales Survey, the number of policies sold decreased 9% in the first half of 2022 though the total net premium rose 11%. Concerns over inflation and a slowdown in the economy have likely weighed on the sales figures, per the report.Nevertheless, a solid surplus level continues to aid insurers in pursuing strategic mergers and acquisitions to gain market share, expand in niche areas, and diversify operations into new business lines and geography.The industry is undergoing accelerated digitalization. Increased use of technology like blockchain, artificial intelligence, advanced analytics, telematics, cloud computing robotic process automation, Chatbot and RoboAdvisory, and insurtech solutions continue to expedite business operations and save costs.Story continuesCan These Stocks Retain the Bull Run Next Year?Per December Economic Projections of the Fed, GDP in 2023 is pegged to grow 0.5%, while the unemployment rate is pinned to be 4.6%. As the insurance industry is an important contributor to the country’s GDP, it is well-poised for growth, given the economic expansion.At its December meeting, Fed predicted to take the interest rate to 5.1% in 2023 to combat its expected 3.1% inflation. Insurers, being the beneficiaries of the rising rate environment, are positioned to generate better investment results.The improved pricing environment should continue through 2023, albeit at a slower pace. Better pricing, improved underwriting standards and streamlined operations should continue to fuel premium. Per Deloitte Insights, the life insurance premium is estimated to increase 1.9% in 2023. The report also stated that trends like commercial lines witnessing growth at a faster pace than personal lines, homeowners’ premiums improving better than personal auto are likely to continue in 2023.Insurers should continue to invest heavily in technology to improve scale and efficiencies, while M&amp;A should be on the rise as more insurers seek growth through expansion.Picks for Better ReturnWith the help of the Zacks Stock Screener, we have selected three insurance stocks that rallied this year and are poised to retain the momentum next year. These top-ranked stocks have rallied more than 25% year to date and have an impressive track of increasing dividends.

11,715190f0-15c5-3e01-b7d5-ed0ef10955cf,STT,2022-12-20,Earnings are growing at State Street (NYSE:STT) but shareholders still don't like its prospects,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/earnings-growing-state-street-nyse-142730706.html,1671460050,STORY,['STT'],"[While it may not be enough for some shareholders, we think it is good to see the State Street Corporation (NYSE:STT) share price up 13% in a single quarter. But if you look at the last five years the returns have not been good. In fact, the share price is down 21%, which falls well short of the return you could get by buying an index fund.After losing 3.2% this past week, it's worth investigating the company's fundamentals to see what we can infer from past performance. See our latest analysis for State Street While markets are a powerful pricing mechanism, share prices reflect investor sentiment, not just underlying business performance. By comparing earnings per share (EPS) and share price changes over time, we can get a feel for how investor attitudes to a company have morphed over time.While the share price declined over five years, State Street actually managed to increase EPS by an average of 4.1% per year. So it doesn't seem like EPS is a great guide to understanding how the market is valuing the stock. Alternatively, growth expectations may have been unreasonable in the past.Given that EPS has increased, but the share price has fallen, it's fair to say that market sentiment around the stock has become more negative. Generally speaking, though, if the company can keep growing EPS then the share price will eventually follow.The company's earnings per share (over time) is depicted in the image below (click to see the exact numbers).earnings-per-share-growthBefore buying or selling a stock, we always recommend a close examination of historic growth trends, available here.What About Dividends?As well as measuring the share price return, investors should also consider the total shareholder return (TSR). The TSR incorporates the value of any spin-offs or discounted capital raisings, along with any dividends, based on the assumption that the dividends are reinvested. Arguably, the TSR gives a more comprehensive picture of the return generated by a stock. In the case of State Street, it has a TSR of -8.6% for the last 5 years. That exceeds its share price return that we previously mentioned. This is largely a result of its dividend payments!Story continuesA Different PerspectiveAlthough it hurts that State Street returned a loss of 11% in the last twelve months, the broader market was actually worse, returning a loss of 19%. Given the total loss of 1.7% per year over five years, it seems returns have deteriorated in the last twelve months. Whilst Baron Rothschild does tell the investor ""buy when there's blood in the streets, even if the blood is your own"", buyers would need to examine the data carefully to be comfortable that the business itself is sound. Before spending more time on State Street it might be wise to click here to see if insiders have been buying or selling shares.We will like State Street better if we see some big insider buys. While we wait, check out this free list of growing companies with considerable, recent, insider buying.Please note, the market returns quoted in this article reflect the market weighted average returns of stocks that currently trade on US exchanges.Have feedback on this article?

12,c4540c3c-80ad-36ae-a5da-5a132387dd8f,TMO,2022-12-20,"In the wake of Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc.'s (NYSE:TMO) latest US$16b market cap drop, institutional owners may be forced to take severe actions",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/wake-thermo-fisher-scientific-inc-110059631.html,1671534059,STORY,['TMO'],"[If you want to know who really controls Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc. (NYSE:TMO), then you'll have to look at the makeup of its share registry. The group holding the most number of shares in the company, around 89% to be precise, is institutions. In other words, the group stands to gain the most (or lose the most) from their investment into the company.As a result, institutional investors endured the highest losses last week after market cap fell by US$16b. Needless to say, the recent loss which further adds to the one-year loss to shareholders of 18% might not go down well especially with this category of shareholders. Also referred to as ""smart money"", institutions have a lot of sway over how a stock's price moves. As a result, if the decline continues, institutional investors may be pressured to sell Thermo Fisher Scientific which might hurt individual investors.In the chart below, we zoom in on the different ownership groups of Thermo Fisher Scientific. See our latest analysis for Thermo Fisher Scientific ownership-breakdownWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Thermo Fisher Scientific?Many institutions measure their performance against an index that approximates the local market. So they usually pay more attention to companies that are included in major indices.We can see that Thermo Fisher Scientific does have institutional investors; and they hold a good portion of the company's stock. This suggests some credibility amongst professional investors. But we can't rely on that fact alone since institutions make bad investments sometimes, just like everyone does. When multiple institutions own a stock, there's always a risk that they are in a 'crowded trade'. When such a trade goes wrong, multiple parties may compete to sell stock fast. This risk is higher in a company without a history of growth. You can see Thermo Fisher Scientific's historic earnings and revenue below, but keep in mind there's always more to the story.earnings-and-revenue-growthSince institutional investors own more than half the issued stock, the board will likely have to pay attention to their preferences. We note that hedge funds don't have a meaningful investment in Thermo Fisher Scientific. The Vanguard Group, Inc. is currently the largest shareholder, with 8.2% of shares outstanding. Meanwhile, the second and third largest shareholders, hold 7.8% and 5.7%, of the shares outstanding, respectively.Story continuesA deeper look at our ownership data shows that the top 25 shareholders collectively hold less than half of the register, suggesting a large group of small holders where no single shareholder has a majority.While it makes sense to study institutional ownership data for a company, it also makes sense to study analyst sentiments to know which way the wind is blowing. There are plenty of analysts covering the stock, so it might be worth seeing what they are forecasting, too.Insider Ownership Of Thermo Fisher ScientificThe definition of company insiders can be subjective and does vary between jurisdictions. Our data reflects individual insiders, capturing board members at the very least. Management ultimately answers to the board. However, it is not uncommon for managers to be executive board members, especially if they are a founder or the CEO.Insider ownership is positive when it signals leadership are thinking like the true owners of the company. However, high insider ownership can also give immense power to a small group within the company. This can be negative in some circumstances.Our most recent data indicates that insiders own less than 1% of Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc.. It is a very large company, so it would be surprising to see insiders own a large proportion of the company. Though their holding amounts to less than 1%, we can see that board members collectively own US$296m worth of shares (at current prices). In this sort of situation, it can be more interesting to  see if those insiders have been buying or selling. General Public OwnershipThe general public, who are usually individual investors, hold a 11% stake in Thermo Fisher Scientific. This size of ownership, while considerable, may not be enough to change company policy if the decision is not in sync with other large shareholders.Next Steps:It's always worth thinking about the different groups who own shares in a company. But to understand Thermo Fisher Scientific better, we need to consider many other factors. Be aware that  Thermo Fisher Scientific is showing  2 warning signs in our investment analysis , you should know about...If you would prefer discover what analysts are predicting in terms of future growth, do not miss this free report on analyst forecasts.NB: Figures in this article are calculated using data from the last twelve months, which refer to the 12-month period ending on the last date of the month the financial statement is dated.

And it all started with her grandmother.""My grandmother had seven kids and was left to raise them on her own after my grandfather passed away serving in the U.S. military,"" explained Trevisano Smith, who is a hub manager and works out of the U.S. Bank Fenton, Missouri, branch, in St. Louis County. ""My grandmother used to take my Dad and his siblings to downtown St. Louis and gaze at the Christmas lights in window displays. It was something that everyone looked forward to that didn't cost any money.""So, 30 years ago when Trevisano Smith was a child, her dad felt inspired to create something similar at his house for people to enjoy. ""I remember Santa Night, when my dad would dress up and my siblings and I would be elves. Eventually, a lot of people started coming out to see the lights and they wanted to give my dad something for helping create special holiday memories, so our family started accepting donations and giving the proceeds to charity.""Since 2004, the Trevisano family has donated more than $125,000 to St. Patrick Center to help thousands of people experiencing homelessness. U.S. Bank employees have joined in the spirit of volunteerism by helping Trevisano Smith's family with the Christmas lights display, which sits within a neighborhood in the Crestwood community.""Over the years, several U.S. Bank employees have reached out and signed up as a team to volunteer at Trevisano Teddy Bear Land - sometimes braving the cold, rain, and snow,"" said Katie Joseph, St. Patrick Center's director of philanthropy operations. ""The community has the opportunity to view an amazing display and offer donations to help their neighbors in need. It is also unique because the family has taken pride in this for many years, and really believe in our mission. It is not about them; it's how many people they can help. I hope when people drive by the display they are filled with the joy of the season and inspired to help their community.""Story continuesBranch Manager Jason Craft, who works at the nearby Sunset Hills branch, said it's a heart-warming experience to volunteer at the event and see the smiles and cheer of the visitors.""The whole purpose is to remember those less fortunate during the holiday season and to live out the mantra of giving versus receiving,"" he said. ""The spectacular decorative display attracts onlookers to help bring the holidays to life - even with their own radio station for onlookers to tune into during their visit! I am so inspired by the family's ongoing commitment, effort and sacrifice each and every year to put on such a wonderful charitable event.""Annually, U.S. Bank gives 16 hours of paid time off for eligible employees to volunteer in their communities. Last year, employees volunteered 731 hours per day with nonprofit organizations.""It's exciting to see the company encourage our employees to get out in the community and do good for others who may not be as fortunate,"" Trevisano Smith said. ""It means a lot to me that some of my colleagues have gotten involved to help our community in this way. I've worked for U.S. Bank for 13 years and I feel like it goes back to our core values - and living out what U.S. Bank wants to represent and what I'm passionate about within my family.""Trevisano Smith said her dad spends up to 400 hours putting up the lights and starts in August so he can make everything just right. Today, her own children are involved and dress up as elves.""This is what I am trying to instill in my children - that they are blessed and Christmas isn't about getting, it's about giving. It's about seeing others happy.""Learn more about U.S. Bank here.View additional multimedia and more ESG storytelling from U.S. Bank on 3blmedia.com.Contact Info:Spokesperson: U.S. BankWebsite: https://www.usbank.com/index.html\Email: info@3blmedia.comSOURCE: U.S. BankView source version on accesswire.com: https://www.accesswire.com/732343/Missouri-Employees-Light-Up-St-Louis-Community-for-a-Good-Cause]"

SFBS gained 2.4% in after-hours trading following the announcement of a dividend hike. The company’s board of directors has approved an increase in its quarterly dividend to 28 cents per share, marking a 21.7% hike from the prior payout. The increased amount will be paid out on Jan 6, 2023, to shareholders on record as of Jan 3.Based on the increased rate, the annual dividend came to $1.12 a share, resulting in an annualized yield of 1.68%, considering the company’s closing price of $66.49 as of Dec 20. The yield is not only attractive to income investors but also represents a steady income stream.The company has hiked its dividend every year since 2014. In December 2021, it increased the dividend by 15% to 23 cents per share.ServisFirst’s ability to sustain the hiked dividend depends on earnings growth and the payout ratio. The company’s current payout ratio is 21%, lower than the industry’s average of 41.7%, indicating decent scope for a steady dividend increase.Further, ServisFirst’s performance depicts a robust earnings picture. Over the last five years, the company’s earnings grew at an 18.1% rate, higher than the industry average of 13.2%. The momentum is likely to continue in the upcoming period, as indicated by 19.4% projected earnings growth this year and 5.8% for 2023.Our TakeWe believe that such continuous hikes highlight SFBS’ operational strength and commitment toward rewarding shareholders handsomely. As investors are always on the lookout for companies with a track record of consistent and incremental dividend payments to betting their money on, solid dividend payouts are arguably the biggest enticement for such investors. Such moves also boost shareholders’ confidence in ServisFirst.However, the deteriorating macroeconomic outlook remains a major near-term headwind, which will likely hurt its financials.Shares of SFBS have lost 21.8% over the past year compared with the industry’s decline of 13.5%.Story continuesZacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchSFBS carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) at present.You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Similar Steps by Other Financial FirmsFranklin Resources, Inc.’s BEN board of directors announced a 3.4% hike in its quarterly dividend.

With this in mind, we are always looking at value, growth, and momentum trends to discover great companies.Looking at the history of these trends, perhaps none is more beloved than value investing. This strategy simply looks to identify companies that are being undervalued by the broader market. Value investors rely on traditional forms of analysis on key valuation metrics to find stocks that they believe are undervalued, leaving room for profits.Zacks has developed the innovative Style Scores system to highlight stocks with specific traits. For example, value investors will be interested in stocks with great grades in the ""Value"" category. When paired with a high Zacks Rank, ""A"" grades in the Value category are among the strongest value stocks on the market today.One stock to keep an eye on is Evercore (EVR). EVR is currently sporting a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy), as well as an A grade for Value. The stock holds a P/E ratio of 10.78, while its industry has an average P/E of 12.04. Over the last 12 months, EVR's Forward P/E has been as high as 11.71 and as low as 6.55, with a median of 8.79.Another notable valuation metric for EVR is its P/B ratio of 2.61. Investors use the P/B ratio to look at a stock's market value versus its book value, which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities. EVR's current P/B looks attractive when compared to its industry's average P/B of 2.78. Over the past 12 months, EVR's P/B has been as high as 3.56 and as low as 2.01, with a median of 2.64.Value investors also frequently use the P/S ratio. This metric is found by dividing a stock's price with the company's revenue. This is a popular metric because sales are harder to manipulate on an income statement, so they are often considered a better performance indicator. EVR has a P/S ratio of 1.37. This compares to its industry's average P/S of 1.94.Story continuesFinally, our model also underscores that EVR has a P/CF ratio of 6.53. This metric focuses on a firm's operating cash flow and is often used to find stocks that are undervalued based on the strength of their cash outlook. EVR's current P/CF looks attractive when compared to its industry's average P/CF of 16.20. Over the past 52 weeks, EVR's P/CF has been as high as 8.49 and as low as 4.47, with a median of 5.90.Investors could also keep in mind Raymond James Financial (RJF), an Financial - Investment Bank stock with a Zacks Rank of # 2 (Buy) and Value grade of A.Furthermore, Raymond James Financial holds a P/B ratio of 2.50 and its industry's price-to-book ratio is 2.78. RJF's P/B has been as high as 2.87, as low as 1.94, with a median of 2.42 over the past 12 months.Value investors will likely look at more than just these metrics, but the above data helps show that Evercore and Raymond James Financial are likely undervalued currently. And when considering the strength of its earnings outlook, EVR and RJF sticks out as one of the market's strongest value stocks.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

JWN need to pay close attention to the stock based on moves in the options market lately. That is because the Apr 21, 2023 $5.00 Call had some of the highest implied volatility of all equity options today.What is Implied Volatility?Implied volatility shows how much movement the market is expecting in the future. Options with high levels of implied volatility suggest that investors in the underlying stocks are expecting a big move in one direction or the other. It could also mean there is an event coming up soon that may cause a big rally or a huge sell-off. However, implied volatility is only one piece of the puzzle when putting together an options trading strategy.What do the Analysts Think?Clearly, options traders are pricing in a big move for Nordstrom shares, but what is the fundamental picture for the company? Currently, Nordstrom is a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) in the Retail - Apparel and Shoes industry that ranks in the Bottom 27% of our Zacks Industry Rank. Over the last 60 days, three analysts have increased their earnings estimates for the current quarter, while six have dropped their estimates. The net effect has taken our Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current quarter from $1.50 per share to $1.45 in that period.Given the way analysts feel about Nordstrom right now, this huge implied volatility could mean there’s a trade developing. Oftentimes, options traders look for options with high levels of implied volatility to sell premium. This is a strategy many seasoned traders use because it captures decay. At expiration, the hope for these traders is that the underlying stock does not move as much as originally expected.Looking to Trade Options?Check out the simple yet high-powered approach that Zacks Executive VP Kevin Matras has used to close recent double and triple-digit winners.

The company’s resort portfolio incorporates 30 unique hotel offerings, including some of the most familiar resort brands in the industry such as Bellagio, MGM Grand, Mandalay Bay and The Mirage.About the Company MGM is headquartered in Las Vegas, Nevada. The company was incorporated in 1986 and employs 52,000 people.  MGM operates through three segments: Las Vegas Strip Resorts, Regional Operations, and MGM China.As a percentage of revenue in 2021, the Las Vegas Strip was 49%, Regional Operations was 35% and MGM China was 12.5%. Management and other operations were 3.5%.MGM is valued at $13.5 billion and has a Forward PE of 28. The company holds a Zacks Style Scores of “B” in Value, but “D” in Growth. The stock pays a small dividend of 0.03%.Q3 Earnings The company reported EPS on November 2nd, missing expectations by 732%. EPS came in at -$1.39 v the $0.22 expected. Revenues beat, coming it at $342B v the $326B expected. The loss was due to a $1.2B expense due to new Macau gaming laws.Outside of that charge, the quarter was the company’s best in history. Las Vegas Strip RevPar was $210 vs $148 last year. Occupancy was up to 93% v the 82% last year. However, China Net revenues were down to $87M v the $289M last year.While the company is optimistic about operations like BetMGM and strong domestic bookings into 2023, analyst are dropping their estimates.EstimatesOver the last 60 days, current quarter estimates have fallen from $0.20 to a negative $1.31.

A move above $39 and the bulls take back control of the stock.In SummaryMGM has a great core business, but complications in Macau gaming laws are hitting their numbers. Additionally, China’s zero-COVID polices continue to hamper its business.While the action is Vegas has been strong, margins are starting to look like an issue. If the customer starts to struggle, some of MGM’s resorts might as well.  For those interested in the gaming space, anoption in the sector might be Monarch Casino &amp; Resort (MCRI).

Selling at a small loss before it snowballs into a large loss is the only way to ensure that a devastating drawdown does not occur within the context of a portfolio.Considering the current market mood filled with ambiguity, it's as important to get rid of fundamentally weak toxic stocks as it is to invest in attractively valued companies possessing fundamental strength.Toxic companies are usually characterized by huge debt loads and are vulnerable to external shocks. These stocks might illusively scale lofty heights in a given time period, but the good show doesn't last for these overblown toxic stocks, as their current price is not justified by their fundamental strength. Accurately identifying such bloated stocks and getting rid of them at the right time can protect your portfolio.Overpricing of these toxic stocks can be attributed to either an irrational enthusiasm surrounding them or some serious fundamental drawbacks. If you own such bubble stocks for an inordinate period of time, you are bound to see massive erosion of wealth.Nonetheless, if you can precisely spot such toxic stocks, you may gain by resorting to an investing strategy called short selling. This strategy allows one to sell a stock first and then buy it when the price falls. While short selling excels in bear markets, it typically loses money in bull markets.Story continuesSo, just like identifying stocks with growth potential, pinpointing toxic stocks and offloading them at the right time is crucial to guard one's portfolio against big losses or make profits by short selling them. Icahn Enterprises, Vestas Wind Systems, MGM Resorts International and DASAN Zhone Solutions, Inc are a few such toxic stocks.Here are four of the 19 toxic stocks that showed up on the screen:Icahn Enterprises is a diversified holding company engaged in various businesses, including investment management, metals, real estate and home fashion.

If you want to skip our analysis of these stocks, go directly to the 5 Best Affordable Stocks To Buy Now.The US equity market has been wading through some rocky terrain since the beginning of 2022. Global economic activity is experiencing a broad-based and sharper-than-expected slowdown, with inflation higher than seen in several decades. When it comes to the three major indexes, the S&amp;P 500 has declined by 19.68%, the Dow Jones Industrial Average has retreated by 10.02%, while the Nasdaq index has fallen 32.38% in 2022 as of December 17. Several negative developments like the Russia-Ukraine conflict, the COVID-19-related lockdowns in China, and the rising inflation in the US weigh heavily on the outlook, and according to World Economic Outlook by the IMF, global economic growth is set to slow down from 3.2% to 2.7% in 2023.In such an environment, it makes sense that investors would look towards stocks lucrative, profitable, and affordable stocks to make the most of the grim macroeconomic headwinds. While the market has declined this year, some affordable stocks have outperformed the broader market for various reasons. While such stocks do not offer the security offered by mega-cap firms like Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), and Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), they provide an opportunity for some decent short-term returns on account of their volatility. In that regard, some of the best affordable stocks include Hewlett Packard Enterprise Company (NYSE:HPE), Ford Motor Company (NYSE:F), and Bank of America Corporation (NYSE:BAC), among others listed below.Source:unsplashOur MethodologyFor our list, we picked 15 of the best stocks that had a share price of $50 or under as of December 17. Each stock on this list has earnings growth potential alongside solid business fundamentals. We ranked these stocks based on the number of hedge funds in our database that held shares in them at the end of the third quarter.Story continuesBest Affordable Stocks To Buy Now15. MarineMax, Inc.

(NYSE:HZO) with a Buy rating and $40 price target. According to the analyst, the MarineMax's business is better equipped to endure a recession relative to 15 years ago and has ""a positive bias"" on the longer-term outlook for the U.S. boating industry.For the fiscal fourth quarter of 2022, MarineMax, Inc. (NYSE:HZO) announced that its quarterly revenues came in at $536.76 million, up 16.10% on a year-over-year basis, and outperformed the market by more than $17.76 million.

(NYSE:SNDR) is a provider of truckload, intermodal and logistics services. Some of the company's services include regional, long-haul, expedited, dedicated, bulk, intermodal, brokerage, cross-dock logistics, pool point distribution, supply chain management, and port logistics.Earlier this October, Stifel analyst Bert Subin lowered the price target on Schneider National, Inc. (NYSE:SNDR) to $29 from $31 and maintained a Buy rating on the shares after having met with management and coming away ""more bullish"" on the future prospects for digital brokerage and specialized truckload.

(NYSE:SNDR) and has disclosed a stake of $56.45 million in the company. Overall, 16 out of the 920 hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey reported owning shares of the company at the end of Q3.13. Griffon Corporation (NYSE:GFF)Share Price as of December 17: $34.95Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 26Griffon Corporation (NYSE:GFF) is a multinational conglomerate company that oversees the operations of its subsidiaries, allocates resources among them and manages their capital structures. It conducts its operations through five subsidiaries: The AMES Companies, ClosetMaid, Clopay Building Products, CornellCookson, and Telephonics Corporation.Earlier this September, Raymond James added Griffon Corporation (NYSE:GFF) to the firm's ""Analyst Current Favorites"" list, which contains the current favorite stock ideas from the analysts in Raymond James equity research.At the end of Q3 2022, 26 hedge funds disclosed ownership of stakes in Griffon Corporation (NYSE GFF).

As of September 30, GAMCO Investors is the largest shareholder in Griffon Corporation (NYSE:GFF) and has stakes worth $87.68 million in the company.Voss Capital made the following comment about Griffon Corporation (NYSE:GFF) in its Q3 2022 investor letter:“Griffon Corporation (NYSE:GFF) remains an outsized long position at ~20% of the Fund.Their consumer and professional products (tools) segment, CPP, continues to disappoint this year as retailers became over inventoried, there was generally poor weather for the peak gardening season, and input cost went through the roof. We assume only a ~$950M valuation for CPP in a sale – a 50% discount to the cumulative combined values paid for the various businesses since 2010.More importantly, GFF’s more valuable garage door segment continues to surprise to the upside in a major way. It is still growing 47% and 2022’s full year EBITDA came in &gt;100% higher than expectations at the start of the year. There has been no demand collapse. And contrary to intense skepticism and pushback that we heard all year long, at 31%, HBP’s EBITDA margins continue to tick higher—and that is before the benefits of lower steel prices are felt. With their initial guidance for 2023 for a “modest EBITDA decline” implying recent HBP EBITDA gains are relatively sustainable, we believe potential acquirers’ fears should be assuaged, thus significantly raising the probability of a favorable valuation in a buyout…” (Click here to read the full text)12. Vale S.A. (NYSE:VALE)Share Price as of December 17: $16.07Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 27Vale S.A. (NYSE:VALE), formerly known as Companhia Vale do Rio Doce, is a Brazilian multinational corporation engaged in metals and mining and one of the largest logistics operators in Brazil. The company is known as the largest producer of iron ore and nickel in the world.On December 8, BMO Capital analyst David Gagliano raised his price target on Vale S.A (NYSE:VALE) to $20 from $16 and maintained an Outperform rating on the shares. The analyst said the company's improved 2023-2024 operating visibility reduces risks and uncertainty for the stock.According to Insider Monkey’s data, 27 hedge funds were long Vale S.A. (NYSE:VALE) at the end of the third quarter of 2022, and Rajiv Jain’s GQG Partners held the largest stake in the company, comprising 21.40 million shares worth $285 million.Here is what GMO LLC had to say about Vale S.A. (NYSE:VALE) in its Q1 2022 investor letter:“Let’s look at Vale (NYSE:VALE), the world’s largest iron ore producer, as a case study for how shareholders can be rewarded. Vale’s stock price is about where it was at the beginning of last year. Despite the market’s lack of enthusiasm, the company generated about $20 billion of free cash flow last year. Not bad for a company with a market cap of a little over $100 billion and no substantive debt as of the end of March. 4 What did the company do with all that cash? Last year, Vale paid out about $9 billion in regularly scheduled dividends and distributed another $10 billion between extra dividends and share repurchases. Combined with dividends distributed in the first quarter of this year and a recently announced share repurchase, Vale has returned or announced the return of over $33 billion since the beginning of last year, almost a 32% yield relative to the market cap of the company. Not a bad way to win.”11. Teladoc Health, Inc. (NYSE:TDOC)Share Price as of December 17: $27.02Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 27Teladoc Health, Inc. (NYSE:TDOC) is a multinational telemedicine and virtual healthcare company that provides telehealth, medical opinions, AI and analytics, telehealth devices and licensable platform services.Oppenheimer analyst Michael Wiederhorn lowered the price target on Teladoc Health, Inc. (NYSE:TDCO) to $45 from $55 and kept an Outperform rating on the shares following quarterly results on October 27. According to the analyst, the company's Q3 results reflected its success in expanding margins, with BetterHelp driving gross margin and Tech/Dev savings driving OpEx. The analyst believes Teladoc is righting the ship with a balanced approach toward efficiency and growth, and remains attractively valued at current prices.At the end of the third quarter of 2022, 27 hedge funds in the database of Insider Monkey held stakes worth $906.3 million in Teladoc Health, Inc. (NYSE:TDOC), compared to 32 the preceding quarter worth $1.2 billion.Greenhaven Road Capital made the following comment about Teladoc Health, Inc. (NYSE:TDOC) in its Q3 2022 investor letter:“At the end of last year and the beginning of this year, I sold two of our highest multiple holdings and invested in Teladoc Health, Inc. (NYSE:TDOC), believing that swapping out of the highest multiple holdings into a lower multiple holding would provide protection in the event of multiple compression. However, the reality is that the multiple compression on currently loss-making (unprofitable) companies has been severe regardless of starting multiple, and TDOC’s lower relative starting point afforded us far less protection than I expected. We are no longer shareholders today but continue to follow the business and may return someday given its market size, product portfolio, and valuation.”10. Macy’s, Inc. (NYSE:M)Share Price as of December 17: $20.40Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 31Macy’s, Inc. (NYSE:M) operates as an American chain of high-end department stores founded in 1858 by Rowland Hussey Macy.

(NYSE:M) to $25 from $21 and maintained a Neutral rating on the shares. Lejuez states that the company's Q3 was better than guidance and consensus forecasts, and while it lowered its Q4 guidance, the new range seems achievable. While the mall-based department store sector is structurally challenged, the analyst believes Macy's risk/reward to be balanced currently.According to Insider Monkey’s database, 31 hedge funds held shares of the company at the end of the third quarter of 2022. Arrowstreet Capital was the most bullish fund on the company’s stock at the end of Q3 2022.9.

The company offers a range of edge computing solutions designed to meet the needs of customers in numerous industries, including retail, manufacturing, healthcare, and finance.On December 5, Loop Capital analyst Ananda Baruah raised the price target on Hewlett Packard Enterprise Company (NYSE:HPE) to $17 from $14 and kept a Hold rating on the shares.

This is compared to 37 hedge funds in the previous quarter with stakes worth $709.4 million.

(NYSE:NCLH) with an Overweight rating and price target of $30, down from $35.

(NYSE:NCLH), compared to 28 funds in the prior quarter worth $287.26 million. John W. Rogers’ Ariel Investments is the leading stakeholder of the company, with 6.40 million shares valued at $71.2 million.Ariel Investment made the following comment about Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd. (NYSE:NCLH) in its Q3 2022 investor letter:“Cruise ship operator Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd. (NYSE:NCLH) also aided relative performance in the period. Onboard spending has been stronger than management expectations and forward booking commentary remains encouraging with both trends and pricing for 2023 ahead of pre-pandemic levels. Though questions persist around the macro backdrop, NCLH has an experienced executive management team at its helm, a young average fleet and solid liquidity position. Over the longterm, we believe the current headwinds travel and leisure are experiencing will soften and expect NCLH’s fundamentals will prove resilient in the face of adversity. At today’s valuation, NCLH is currently trading at a -70% discount to our estimate of private market value.”7. FirstEnergy Corp.

The analyst updated his model to reflect the company's Q3 results and recent data points. The analyst's new target represents modestly higher multiples reflecting the company's improved auto free cash flow conversion in 2022.At the end of the third quarter of 2022, 47 hedge funds in the database of Insider Monkey held stakes worth $1.2 billion in Ford Motor Company (NYSE:F), compared to 46 in the preceding quarter worth $608.8 million.In its Q3 2022 investor letter, Leaven Partners, an asset management firm, highlighted a few stocks and Ford Motor Company (NYSE:F) was one of them. Here is what the fund said:“In our last quarterly letter, I briefly mentioned that the consensus estimates for corporate profits appeared to be a bit too sanguine. I referenced a Reuters article that reported, as of June 17, Wall Street expected S&amp;P 500 earnings to grow by 9.6% in 2022, which was up from 8.8% in April and from 8.4% in January. That tune began to change at the end of July and accelerated in August and September, as major players, such as Ford (NYSE:F), have recently issued profit warnings and/or have withdrawn guidance. In response, Wall Street has altered its outlook: lowering third-quarter profit growth to 4.6% [2] from 7.2% in early August and slashing full-year profit growth to 4.5%.” Click to continue reading and see 5 Best Affordable Stocks To Buy Now. Suggested Articles:11 Best Diabetes Stocks To Buy Now15 Best Dividend Stocks of All Time15 Biggest Juice Companies and BrandsDisclosure: None. 15 Best Affordable Stocks To Buy Nowis originally published on Insider Monkey.]"

Here’s what’s happening:Prices: Bitcoin heads lower into Asia hours, though some analysts wonder if the largest cryptocurrency might hold up better than stocks in an earnings recession.Insights: Taiwan's dreams of becoming a crypto hub remain elusive, despite the inevitable chatter that sprang up following a successful Taipei Blockchain Week.PricesBitcoin dropping into Asia trading hoursBy Bradley KeounBitcoin (BTC) was dropping in early Asia hours, down 2% over the past 24 hours, to around $16,439. The CoinDesk Market Index (CMI) was also down about 2%. In a potentially unnerving development, bitcoin addresses tied to the defunct Canadian crypto exchange QuadrigaCX suddenly became active.Trading was mostly anemic during U.S. hours, with equity markets starting to reflect nervousness over the potential for any drop-off in corporate earnings that might come with a recession. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite closed down 1.49%. The S&amp;P 500 slid 0.90% and the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 0.49%.Crypto analysts are starting to wonder if bitcoin might hold up better than stocks if the economy turns down.""The muted beta in crypto aligns with the idea that crypto assets might be less susceptible to a drawdown in equities catalyzed by an earnings recession,"" FundStrat's Sean Farrell wrote Monday in a note to investors.According to the crypto hedge fund BitBull Capital, the $20,000 mark looms as a major resistance point for the bitcoin market. On the downside, the next point to watch would be the November low around $15,500.InsightsTaipei Blockchain Week was a success, but there are reasons Taiwan isn’t a crypto hubBy Sam ReynoldsAfter every successful crypto conference in Taipei, the narrative that Taiwan is the undiscovered blockchain hub of Asia invariably comes up. It never seems to have any legs.Taipei Blockchain Week, a conference put together by Taiwan-focused Bu Zhi Dao (a play on the Chinese term for ‘I don’t know’), wrapped up Saturday. Despite being put together at the last minute because of uncertainty around Covid rules, there were around 1,700 in attendance. It wasn’t quite the star-studded Asia Blockchain Summit, but the energy was optimistic, despite the bear market.Story continuesIt’s hard to say that about Taiwan’s prospects for becoming a blockchain hub. Back in 2018, then KMT-legislator Jason Hsu said Taiwan could become a “blockchain island.” This year, the Hong Kong-based investor Sora Ventures said it was moving its fund to Taiwan. But an attempt to create a Security Token Offering structure to allow crypto firms to raise money in a regulatory-friendly way never really took off, because of a low cap on the amount one can fundraise.While there are many digital nomads in the crypto industry in Taiwan, including projects that purport to be on the island, few are actually incorporated locally as the rules around capital formation make it too difficult. Many business cards given out at Taipei Blockchain Week carried addresses in Singapore, Hong Kong and BVI.“Rarely is Taiwan the place to incorporate a start-up company's parent,” Ross Feingold, special counsel at Taipei-based Titan Attorneys at Law, told CoinDesk. “The traditional corporate structures are not start-up friendly because of limitations on a founder's services as payment for shares and limitations on share transfer restrictions among other issues, as well as the corporate governance requirements.”Authorities in Taiwan created a new company structure in 2015 that tried to address some of these issues but it's complex to understand, Feingold explained, especially for those who can’t read Chinese at the level of an accountant or lawyer.Those that do make the attempt to incorporate in Taiwan complain about the three to four months it takes; a company can be registered in Singapore in an average of 1.5 days and in less than 48 hours in Hong Kong. Both of those jurisdictions use common law, with a share structure more familiar to international investors, and they have more competitive tax regimes than Taiwan’s corporate tax rate and its withholding tax on dividends.At the height of COVID-19, Taiwan’s digital nomad friendly Gold Card, which allowed one to make the move provided they could prove they had an income of $67,000 or more, made things look appealing. Feingold says that’s only the case for digital nomads and freelancers.“The allure waned if the individual really needs to be in a place where the corporate headquarters is sited,” he said. “Some of the same issues that hinder Taiwan as a startup nation existed then and remain unchanged.”Feingold says that while Taiwan’s regulator, the Financial Supervisory Commission, has put in minimal restrictions for now, there’s always the “lingering risk that Taiwan's financial or tax authorities become more proactive in regulating the industry.”For what it’s worth, Thailand, another regional suitor, also has complicated and arcane company formation laws, even though Thailand’s Siam Commercial Bank, the most institutional of all investors in-country, actively invests and supports decentralized finance (DeFi) projects. That might help explain why Thai-based teams also incorporate elsewhere – much like those in Taiwan.Important events11:00 a.m. HKT/SGT(3:00 UTC) Bank of Japan Interest Rate Decision9:30 p.m. HKT/SGT(13:30 UTC) Canada Retail Sales (MoM/Oct)11:00 p.m. HKT/SGT(15:00 UTC) Eurozone Consumer Confidence (Dec) CoinDesk TVIn case you missed it, here is the most recent episode of ""First Mover"" on CoinDesk TV:Sam Bankman-Fried Reportedly Expected to Accept US Extradition; Bitcoin Remains in Tight RangeFTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried has reportedly had a change of heart and won't contest U.S. extradition.

The yellow metal is trading slightly lower for 2022, and is also down substantially from peaks hit during the initial days of the Russia-Ukraine conflict.Spot gold fell 0.1% to $1,785.46 an ounce, while gold futures fell 0.2% to $1,794.60 an ounce by 19:25 ET (00:25 GMT).The latest selling pressure on gold comes from a series of hawkish central bank comments last week, which heralded a continued rise in interest rates in the coming year. The trend spells more pressure on gold and other metals, as rising rates battered the metals market by driving up the opportunity cost of holding non-yielding assets.Investors are now also concerned over a potential recession in 2023, driven chiefly by high inflation and rising interest rates.Focus on slowing economic growth is also expected to define the last two trading weeks of 2022 amid a dearth of other cues. Trading volumes are also expected to be diminished by a series of market holidays.Other precious metals also retreated on Tuesday.Among industrial metals, copper prices were steadier than their peers amid continued bets that an economic recovery in China will fuel copper demand.Copper futures rose 0.1% to $3.7637 a pound.But the red metal’s outlook remains clouded by uncertainty over a global recession, with weakening economic activity across the globe likely to offset a demand recovery in major importer China.Story continuesStill, tightening copper supply, due to political unrest in top producers Chile and Peru, is likely to help support prices in the coming months.Related ArticlesGold prices slip further below $1,800 as rate hike fears weighOil climbs, but uncertainty on China COVID surge caps gainsRainforest-rich nations ensure COP15 deal on nature sticks]"

Zoom Video (ZM): Which Stock is the Better Buy for 2023?,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/salesforce-crm-vs-zoom-video-021202693.html,1671502322,STORY,"['CRM', 'ZM']","[Two of the most popular tech stocks during the pandemic were Salesforce CRM and Zoom Video Communications ZM. Their popularity and notoriety increased as employers heavily relied upon both services for telecommuting and remote work purposes as covid-19 shut down offices.Fast forward to the end of 2022, and both stocks are near their 52-week lows. Let’s see if it’s time to buy Salesforce or Zoom stock in the hopes of a rebound in 2023.Brief Overview Salesforce is the largest customer relationship management vendor in the world, enabling organizations to better manage critical operations. The company’s offerings include sales force automation, customer service and support, marketing automation, document management, analytics, and custom application development.As for Zoom Video, the company went public in 2019 and was very instrumental in remote work during the pandemic as a communications platform that combines video, audio, phone, screen sharing, and chat functionalities.Outside of inflationary concerns challenging the broader market, Zoom Video, in particular, still has much to prove after its usage has naturally declined as we move further away from the pandemic.Recent Performance &amp; Valuation  Salesforce stock is down -49% year to date to slightly outperform Zoom Video’s -62%, but both have lagged the S&amp;P 50’s -20% and the Nasdaq’s -32%. Over the last three years since Zoom went public, ZM is up +11% to outperform CRM’s -17% during this time frame. These performances have also lagged the broader indexes.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchTrading at $129 per share and roughly 51% from its highs, Salesforce has a forward P/E of 26X. In comparison, Zoom Video is now 66% off its high at $69 a share and trades at 17.1X forward earnings.Taking the last three years into account since Zoom went public, ZM trades well below its absurd high of 11,193X and 79% below the median of 81.7X.  When comparing this period, CRM trades nicely below its three-year high of 245.4X and also 79% below its median of 126.4X.Story continuesWith both stocks trading at a 79% discount to their median P/Es, let’s see which companies’ outlook appears better going into 2023.Growth Salesforce earnings are now projected to rise 3% in its current fiscal 2023 and jump 15% in FY24 at $5.65 per share. More impressive, earnings estimate revisions have trended higher for both FY23 and FY24 over the last 90 days.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchOn the top line, sales are forecasted to climb 17% in FY23 and rise another 10% in FY24 to $34.22 billion. FY24 would be a stellar 157% increase from pre-pandemic levels with 2019 sales at $13.28 billion.Pivoting to Zoom Video, its current fiscal 2023 earnings are projected to decline -19% at $4.08 per share. Fiscal 2024 earnings are expected to drop another -9%.This is a clear indication that the tougher operating environment is affecting Zoom Video’s bottom line. Earnings estimates have gone up for FY23 but have slightly declined for FY24. Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchSales are forecasted to be up 7% in FY23 and rise another 5% in FY24 to $4.60 billion. Still, on the top line, FY24 would be an impressive 1,290% increase from 2019 sales of $331 million. Bottom Line The top line growth of Salesforce (CRM) and Zoom Video (ZM) makes both stocks look like viable investments for 2023 and beyond. However, Salesforce’s bottom line looks stronger, with CRM sporting a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) in correlation with rising earnings estimates revisions for FY23 and FY24.CRM is a more diversified cloud software firm while Zoom has mostly remained in the communications space with ZM landing a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) at the moment. Both stocks are starting to look attractive at their current levels, especially from a long-term perspective.The average Zacks Price Target suggests 48% upside for CRM’s stock and 38% upside for ZM, respectively.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

The company’s cost of sales rose 2.1% year over year, and selling, general and administrative expenses increased 2% in the first nine months of 2022. Also, the potential recessionary environment is expected to weaken FLS’ GDP-driven markets, including chemicals and general industries.The company’s high debt level raises a concern. Flowserve’s long-term debt remained high at $1,232.2 million at the end of third-quarter 2022. Fresh issuances of debt instruments in the quarters ahead might inflate the company’s financial obligations and hurt profitability.Though Flowserve’s realignment plans are expected to provide benefits in the long run, the same is fuelling its expenses and adversely impacting its profitability. FLS’ net income might be affected by realignment expenses in the near term. The bottom line might also be hurt by incremental expenses.Due to its significant presence in the international markets, Flowserve is exposed to unfavorable foreign currency movement. In third-quarter 2022, foreign exchange headwinds adversely impacted its sales by $1.1 million. A stronger U.S. dollar might depress its overseas business's results in the quarters ahead.The negativity surrounding the stock is evident from the Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2022 earnings being revised downward by 33.1% in the past 60 days. Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment Research Due to the above-mentioned woes, the stock has lost 4.8% compared with the industry’s 16.8% decline in the year-to-date period.Story continuesStocks to ConsiderSome better-ranked companies from the Industrial Products sector are discussed below:Applied Industrial Technologies, Inc.

If you want to see more stocks in this selection, check out 5 Best Medical Technology Stocks To Buy. The global medical devices market is expected to grow from $495.46 billion in 2022 to $718.92 billion by 2029 at a CAGR of 5.5% during the forecast period. Increasing investments in research and development by medical technology firms, combined with favorable policies and regulations, are anticipated to advance the medical device industry over the next few years. Following the pandemic years, digital healthcare has become indispensable, and the medical technology industry has seen meaningful demand for online medical and AI-powered technology services. Companies in the digital healthcare space have witnessed their stocks rally despite economic turbulence. During the pandemic, seeing the accelerating demand for medtech treatment options, many conventional healthcare companies transformed themselves and offered technology-led health solutions to survive and gain market share. Some of the most popular medtech solutions include telemedicine, robotic surgery, medical imaging technologies, wearable medical devices, and AI-led healthcare management options. Investors seeking exposure to the medical technology sector can pick up stocks like DexCom, Inc. (NASDAQ:DXCM), Intuitive Surgical, Inc. (NASDAQ:ISRG), and Danaher Corporation (NYSE:DHR). Our Methodology We selected the following medical technology stocks based on positive analyst coverage, strong business fundamentals, and market visibility. We have assessed the hedge fund sentiment from Insider Monkey’s database of 920 elite hedge funds tracked as of the end of the third quarter of 2022. The list is arranged according to the number of hedge fund holders in each firm. Best Medical Technology Stocks to Buy11. Stryker Corporation (NYSE:SYK)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 34Stryker Corporation (NYSE:SYK) is a Michigan-based medical technology company that operates through two segments – MedSurg and Neurotechnology, and Orthopaedics and Spine. The company offers implants for use in joint replacements and trauma surgeries. Stryker Corporation (NYSE:SYK) also provides surgical equipment and surgical navigation systems, endoscopic and communications systems, emergency medical equipment, intensive care disposable products, and reprocessed and remanufactured medical devices. Story continuesOn December 7, Stryker Corporation (NYSE:SYK) declared a $0.75 per share quarterly dividend, a 7.9% increase from its prior dividend of $0.695. The dividend is payable on January 31, 2023 to shareholders of record on December 30. The dividend yield on December 19 came in at 1.25%. Cowen analyst Joshua Jennings on December 14 raised the price target on Stryker Corporation (NYSE:SYK) to $283 from $233 and kept an Outperform rating on the shares. The analyst said the company looks positioned to provide positive 2023 revenue guidance on the back of a strong fourth quarter.According to Insider Monkey’s data, 34 hedge funds were bullish on Stryker Corporation (NYSE:SYK) at the end of September 2022, compared to 46 funds in the prior quarter. Terry Smith’s Fundsmith LLP is the largest stakeholder of the company, with 5.6 million shares worth $1.14 billion.Like DexCom, Inc. (NASDAQ:DXCM), Intuitive Surgical, Inc. (NASDAQ:ISRG), and Danaher Corporation (NYSE:DHR), Stryker Corporation (NYSE:SYK) is one of the premier medical technology stocks to consider. Diamond Hill Capital made the following comment about Stryker Corporation (NYSE:SYK) in its Q3 2022 investor letter:“Stryker Corporation (NYSE:SYK) was the only new addition to the portfolio in Q3. It is one of the largest medical device manufacturers with a track record of consistently outgrowing its end markets and competitors. Stryker has a highly performance driven culture with a decentralized operating model that results in strong incentive alignment within the company. We believe the management team has executed well, making small but meaningful decisions that have positioned the firm well among competitors. Management operates with a market share gain mentality and strives to be a category leader in the market they are in. Stryker also benefits from its broad portfolio of surgical tools, small and large cap hospital equipment, waste management products, etc., which enables it to address all the needs of a hospital operating room and be a one-stop shop for health care facilities. This is particularly appealing to hospitals, and it positions Stryker to be the supplier of all operating room equipment versus a single product, thus enabling the company to gain market share.”10. Inspire Medical Systems, Inc. (NYSE:INSP)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 37Inspire Medical Systems, Inc. (NYSE:INSP) is a Minnesota-based medical technology company focused on the development and commercialization of minimally invasive solutions for patients with obstructive sleep apnea in the United States and internationally. It is one of the best medical technology stocks to invest in. On November 1, Inspire Medical Systems, Inc. (NYSE:INSP) reported a revenue of $109.2 million, up 77.0% year-over-year, beating Wall Street estimates by $14.59 million. Inspire Medical Systems, Inc. (NYSE:INSP) raised its full-year 2022 revenue guidance to between $384 million to $388 million, which would represent growth of 65% to 66% over the 2021 revenue of $233.4 million. This compares to the prior revenue guidance of $354 million to $362 million and a Wall Street estimate of $361.29 million.Goldman Sachs analyst Amit Hazan upgraded Inspire Medical Systems, Inc. (NYSE:INSP) on December 13 to Buy from Neutral with a price target of $308, up from $245. Given ""strong visibility"" and the company's ""track record of execution,"" the analyst sees upside to present consensus and expects ""strong"" upcoming 2023 guidance. Given multiple compression over the last six months relative to the group, the shares now offer improved better risk/reward, added the analyst, who categorized Inspire Medical Systems, Inc. (NYSE:INSP) as his top Medtech midcap for 2023.According to Insider Monkey’s data, Inspire Medical Systems, Inc. (NYSE:INSP) was part of 37 hedge fund portfolios at the end of Q3 2022, compared to 31 in the prior quarter. Andreas Halvorsen’s Viking Global held the largest stake in the company, comprising 633,572 shares worth $112.3 million. Here is what Alger Capital specifically said about Inspire Medical Systems, Inc. (NYSE:INSP) in its Q2 2022 investor letter:“Inspire Medical Systems, Inc. (NYSE:INSP) markets the only FDA-approved implantable neuromodulation device used to treat obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). Inspire’s device monitors a patient’s breathing and delivers electrical stimulation to the hypoglossal nerve in order to maintain an open airway.We believe the second quarter underperformance of Inspire shares is primarily attributable to the rotation away from high-growth, high-valuation health care names that are currently unprofitable. Additionally, we think the underperformance was compounded by Inspire being one of the best-performing medical device stocks in the first quarter. We believe many investors have been “selling the winners” in a risk-off environment. Looking ahead, we continue to believe that Inspire is one of the best growth opportunities in medical devices with no anticipated immediate competition. We also believe its market is highly underpenetrated.”9. Align Technology, Inc. (NASDAQ:ALGN)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 38Align Technology, Inc. (NASDAQ:ALGN) is an Arizona-based medical device company that designs, manufactures, and markets Invisalign clear aligners and iTero intraoral scanners and services for restorative and aesthetic dentistry. On October 31, Align Technology, Inc. (NASDAQ:ALGN) announced an accelerated stock repurchase agreement with Goldman Sachs to repurchase $200 million of its common stock as part of the $1 billion share repurchase program disclosed in May. The transaction will be funded with cash on hand and is expected to conclude by February 1, 2023. Align Technology, Inc. (NASDAQ:ALGN) is one of the premier medical technology stocks to monitor. On October 27, Stifel analyst Jonathan Block maintained a Buy recommendation on Align Technology, Inc. (NASDAQ:ALGN) but lowered the price target on the shares to $265 from $325. Following the company's Q3 results and guidance, 2022 and 2023 EBITDA and EPS estimates are likely to ""come toppling down,"" said the analyst. Now, investors ""will have to decide if the tables could turn in coming quarters,"" noted Block, who added that comps will ease, innovation should improve, and that Align Technology, Inc. (NASDAQ:ALGN)’s market share ""seems to be relatively resilient.""According to Insider Monkey’s data, 38 hedge funds were bullish on Align Technology, Inc. (NASDAQ:ALGN) at the end of September 2022, compared to 33 funds in the last quarter. Brian Bares’ Bares Capital Management is the largest position holder in the company, with 913,324 shares worth over $189 million. Here is what Polen Global Growth has to say about Align Technology, Inc. (NASDAQ:ALGN) in its Q2 2022 investor letter:“Align Technology shares declined significantly during the second quarter when management reported a meaningful deceleration in growth. Management cited a host of challenges, including COVID19 impacts, especially in China with restrictions and lockdowns under their zero-COVID policy, a weaker economic environment, inflationary pressures, supply chain disruptions, and the war in Ukraine, to name a few. Tough comparisons were also a reality — Invisalign case starts in 1Q22 were roughly flat, having lapped the 66% growth from the prior year. It’s not completely surprising that growth is slowing on such tough comparisons, but the company’s shares declined on the news.By looking at Align’s three-year compound average growth rate (CAGR) to smooth out the ups and downs through COVID, key metrics like Invisalign case shipment, clear aligner revenue, and earnings per share have all grown ~20% during the trailing three years. We think this is quite respectable given the challenges during this period, but the lack of near-term momentum or visibility has not been well received in the current environment. According to our research, Align is the clear market leader, has global scale, a superior product, and still very modest market penetration. While growth may be challenged near term, we remain confident in the long-term growth opportunity.”8. Veeva Systems Inc. (NYSE:VEEV)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 42Veeva Systems Inc. (NYSE:VEEV) is a California-based company that provides cloud-based software for the life sciences industry in North America, Europe, the Asia Pacific, the Middle East, Africa, and Latin America. The company offers customer relationship management and data management applications for the medical industry. It is one of the premier medical technology stocks to monitor. On December 1, Veeva Systems Inc. (NYSE:VEEV) reported a Q3 non-GAAP EPS of $1.13 and a revenue of $552.35 million, outperforming Wall Street estimates by $0.06 and $6.29 million, respectively. Non-GAAP operating income for the third quarter was $219.5 million, compared to $199.4 million a year ago, representing an increase of 10% year-over-year.KeyBanc analyst Scott Schoenhaus on December 5 maintained an Overweight rating on Veeva Systems Inc. (NYSE:VEEV) but lowered the price target on the shares to $210 from $220 to reflect some multiple impairment as the company works toward moving its CRM business from Salesforce to its Vault Platform when the contract expires in September 2025. The analyst noted the company posted a strong quarter with top and bottom-line beats, but guided slightly below expectations on Q4 billings, revenue, and operating profits.According to Insider Monkey’s third quarter database, 42 hedge funds were long Veeva Systems Inc. (NYSE:VEEV), compared to 45 funds in the prior quarter. Greg Poole’s Echo Street Capital Management is the largest position holder in the company, with 899,876 shares worth $148.3 million. Here is what Artisan Partners specifically said about Veeva Systems Inc. (NYSE:VEEV) in its Q2 2022 investor letter:“Veeva Systems Inc. (NYSE:VEEV) is one of the highest quality franchises in our portfolio. The company has the dominant CRM platform for pharmaceutical sales and marketing organizations, and it is replicating that success with the rollout of numerous other modules focused on pharmaceutical customers’ manufacturing, quality, safety and clinical operations. Growth has temporarily slowed over the past year as the company laps difficult YoY comparisons caused by the rapid adoption of their virtual sales call solution during the pandemic. Several large deals also encountered unexpected delays in late 2021. Despite these short-term headwinds, we remain confident in Veeva’s future growth prospects and high-quality business model (~40% free cash flow margins supported by largely recurring subscription revenues). Meanwhile, we believe the defensive nature of its end market (health care) and strategic importance of cloud IT driven transformations could help buffer the company against a weaker global economy. As shares declined in Q2 along with other software stocks, we added to our position.”7. Bio-Rad Laboratories, Inc. (NYSE:BIO)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 45Bio-Rad Laboratories, Inc. (NYSE:BIO) is one of the best medical technology stocks to consider buying. The California-based company manufactures and distributes life science research and clinical diagnostic products in the United States, Europe, Asia, Canada, and Latin America. Bio-Rad Laboratories, Inc. (NYSE:BIO) focuses on selected segments of the life sciences market such as proteomics, genomics, biopharmaceutical production, cellular biology, and food safety. It is one of the leading medical technology stocks to buy. On December 6, RBC Capital analyst Conor McNamara initiated coverage of Bio-Rad Laboratories, Inc. (NYSE:BIO) with an Outperform rating and a $565 price target. He believes shareholders will benefit from ""an extended period of multiple expansion"" as the company continues to deliver revenue acceleration and margin improvement. The stock trades at a 60%-70% discount to peers and with $200 per share in cash and investments has ""the most balance sheet optionality of any company in our sector,"" the analyst noted.According to Insider Monkey’s data, 45 hedge funds were bullish on Bio-Rad Laboratories, Inc. (NYSE:BIO) at the end of the third quarter of 2022, compared to 43 funds in the prior quarter. Israel Englander’s Millennium Management is the biggest position holder in the company, with 458,645 shares worth $191.3 million. 6. Medtronic plc (NYSE:MDT)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 55Medtronic plc (NYSE:MDT) develops, manufactures, and commercializes device-based medical therapies to healthcare systems, physicians, clinicians, and patients worldwide. The company operates through Cardiovascular Portfolio, Medical Surgical Portfolio, Neuroscience Portfolio, and Diabetes Operating Unit segments. On December 8, Medtronic plc (NYSE:MDT) declared a quarterly dividend of $0.68 per share, in line with previous. The dividend is payable on January 13, 2022 to shareholders of record on December 21. The dividend yield on December 19 came in at 3.55%. On November 30, Wells Fargo analyst Larry Biegelsen maintained an Equal Weight rating on Medtronic plc (NYSE:MDT) and trimmed the firm's price target on the shares to $77 from $82. The analyst updated his 2024 and forward EPS forecast for Medtronic plc (NYSE:MDT), as he factored in the FX impact on EPS.According to Insider Monkey’s third quarter database, 55 hedge funds were bullish on Medtronic plc (NYSE:MDT), compared to 54 funds in the earlier quarter. Peter Rathjens, Bruce Clarke, and John Campbell’s Arrowstreet Capital is the largest stakeholder of the company, with 7.16 million shares worth $578.30 million. Like DexCom, Inc. (NASDAQ:DXCM), Intuitive Surgical, Inc. (NASDAQ:ISRG), and Danaher Corporation (NYSE:DHR), Medtronic plc (NYSE:MDT) is one of the best medical technology stocks to invest in. Here is what Artisan Partners specifically said about Medtronic plc (NYSE:MDT) in its Q2 2022 investor letter:“While Medtronic plc (NYSE:MDT)’s procedure volumes recovered to pre-COVID levels, foreign exchange headwinds overshadowed underlying business value growth, and supply chain issues, including those related to China’s lockdowns, impacted the surgical innovations business. The downdraft in the market during the quarter led to a pile-on. We are being patient with our investment in Medtronic because the company continues to be a strong free cash flow generator and is attractively priced, with a FCF yield of 5% on trailing one-year numbers and a dividend yield of 3%. Medtronic is under new management that is focused on growing the company’s top line, reinvesting in R&amp;D, returning cash to shareholders and growing operating profits. We like new management’s strategy and believe new product launches, increased surgery visits, sound M&amp;A transactions and a shareholder returns focus, should reinvigorate the business. We added to our positions in these health care names during the quarter.” Click to continue reading and see 5 Best Medical Technology Stocks To Buy.  Suggested articles:12 Dividend Stocks That Outperform S&amp;P 50010 Stocks Under $5 With High Potential10 Best Performing Technology ETFs in 2022 Disclosure: None. 11 Best Medical Technology Stocks To Buy is originally published on Insider Monkey.]"

The Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model is the tool we will apply to do this. Models like these may appear beyond the comprehension of a lay person, but they're fairly easy to follow.We would caution that there are many ways of valuing a company and, like the DCF, each technique has advantages and disadvantages in certain scenarios. For those who are keen learners of equity analysis, the Simply Wall St analysis model here may be something of interest to you. View our latest analysis for Microsoft The CalculationWe're using the 2-stage growth model, which simply means we take in account two stages of company's growth. In the initial period the company may have a higher growth rate and the second stage is usually assumed to have a stable growth rate. In the first stage we need to estimate the cash flows to the business over the next ten years. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.A DCF is all about the idea that a dollar in the future is less valuable than a dollar today, so we discount the value of these future cash flows to their estimated value in today's dollars:10-year free cash flow (FCF) forecast2023202420252026202720282029203020312032 Levered FCF ($, Millions) US$66.0bUS$78.0bUS$92.1bUS$104.2bUS$116.9bUS$126.2bUS$134.0bUS$140.6bUS$146.3bUS$151.3bGrowth Rate Estimate SourceAnalyst x23Analyst x22Analyst x10Analyst x6Analyst x4Est @ 7.98%Est @ 6.18%Est @ 4.92%Est @ 4.04%Est @ 3.42% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 7.6% US$61.3kUS$67.4kUS$74.0kUS$77.8kUS$81.1kUS$81.4kUS$80.3kUS$78.3kUS$75.8kUS$72.8k(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$750bStory continuesThe second stage is also known as Terminal Value, this is the business's cash flow after the first stage. The Gordon Growth formula is used to calculate Terminal Value at a future annual growth rate equal to the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield of 2.0%. We discount the terminal cash flows to today's value at a cost of equity of 7.6%.Terminal Value (TV)= FCF2032 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$151b× (1 + 2.0%) ÷ (7.6%– 2.0%) = US$2.8tPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$2.8t÷ ( 1 + 7.6%)10= US$1.3tThe total value is the sum of cash flows for the next ten years plus the discounted terminal value, which results in the Total Equity Value, which in this case is US$2.1t. In the final step we divide the equity value by the number of shares outstanding. Relative to the current share price of US$240, the company appears about fair value at a 14% discount to where the stock price trades currently. Remember though, that this is just an approximate valuation, and like any complex formula - garbage in, garbage out.dcfThe AssumptionsWe would point out that the most important inputs to a discounted cash flow are the discount rate and of course the actual cash flows. Part of investing is coming up with your own evaluation of a company's future performance, so try the calculation yourself and check your own assumptions. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Microsoft as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 7.6%, which is based on a levered beta of 1.006. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.SWOT Analysis for MicrosoftStrengthEarnings growth over the past year exceeded the industry.Debt is not viewed as a risk.Dividends are covered by earnings and cash flows.WeaknessEarnings growth over the past year is below its 5-year average.Dividend is low compared to the top 25% of dividend payers in the Software market.OpportunityAnnual revenue is forecast to grow faster than the American market.Good value based on P/E ratio and estimated fair value.ThreatAnnual earnings are forecast to grow slower than the American market.Next Steps:Valuation is only one side of the coin in terms of building your investment thesis, and it shouldn't be the only metric you look at when researching a company. The DCF model is not a perfect stock valuation tool. Preferably you'd apply different cases and assumptions and see how they would impact the company's valuation. If a company grows at a different rate, or if its cost of equity or risk free rate changes sharply, the output can look very different. For Microsoft, there are three essential aspects you should further examine:Risks: To that end, you should be aware of the   1 warning sign  we've spotted with Microsoft .Management:Have insiders been ramping up their shares to take advantage of the market's sentiment for MSFT's future outlook?

No one wants to be ""the first to say it,"" but the math shows it's no longer within reach, Gates said in a video interview with Reuters.The software-developer-turned-philanthropist was nevertheless upbeat about climate innovation - ticking off numerous areas advancing low-carbon technologies with funding from the Breakthrough Energy Group, which Gates founded in 2015.Gates has invested more than $2 billion toward climate technologies, including direct air capture, solar energy and nuclear fission. The 14-year-old fission company under the Breakthrough umbrella, TerraPower, aims to have a demo reactor running by 2030.These things take time, said Gates, co-founder of Microsoft Corp.Gates spoke with Reuters ahead of the release of his annual letter - reflecting on 2022 and describing what he's most excited about in the year ahead.He transferred $20 billion of his funds to the Gates Foundation's endowment, which plans to increase philanthropic spending on public health and education from $6 billion to $9 billion in coming years.He also praised Warren Buffett for his contribution, which Gates said totaled $45 billion since 2006, counting Berkshire Hathaway stock appreciation.Breakthrough Energy, however, operates separately from the Gates Foundation charity. In his letter to shareholders, Gates explains that the climate problem is too enormous for philanthropy alone to tackle.""There's not enough money, and so you have to have some innovation,"" he told Reuters. ""The idea that it can be done by brute force, there's just no chance.""Story continuesCompanies need investment and technical support to prove their low-carbon ideas beyond the pilot phase - and then to scale up manufacturing, he says. But any Breakthrough Energy profits are funneled back into the group or to the foundation.Some of the companies under Breakthrough that are developing Direct Air Capture (DAC) - technology designed to pull CO2 straight from the atmosphere - have their sights set on some $3.5 billion in newly announced U.S. contracts to build DAC plants and fund research grants.""We have a number of Direct Air Capture companies that will bid on being a part of those projects,"" he said, noting that the recent Inflation Reduction Act legislation has boosted prospects for climate innovation.

According to Financial Times, the once thriving market is set to decline for the very first time since the beginning of the smart phone era.The cards have changedWe might know mobile games since Nokia’s snake from the late 90s and Nintendo, but Apple’s App Store launched them to unforeseen heights when it was created in 2008, fueling the industry to its $100 billion value and making it accountable for half of the gaming industry’s overall revenues. Even the streaming pioneer Netflix took part in the game with two more games to be launched soon and bringing the total number of games available on its platform to 48. August data of Netflix showed that less than 1% of its streaming subscriber base is playing these games on a daily basis, even Netflix is determined to position itself in the gaming universe.But after more than a decade of extraordinary growth for Netflix, once a fast-growing industry is now facing limitations such as rising advertising costs, weakened customer power and the end of the pandemic that boosted player engagement to unforeseen heights. Many fear that the industry is maturing and even reaching saturation as the pace of innovation has also slowed down.A wakeup call for the industryAccording to the forecast made by gaming data company Newzoo, this year’s revenues are forecasted to fall by 6.4 per cent to $92.2 billion, making a sharp reversal from last year’s 7.3 percent growth and 2020’s impressive 25.6 percent rise owed to lockdowns that made inhouse entertainment the center of our lives. Besides setting a high bar in user engagement, COVID-19 also brought on major supply chain issues that hampered sales of Sony Group’s (NYSE: SONY) eagerly awaited PlayStation 5 console that was the most popular this year, both in terms of units and dollar value. Last month, Ampere Analysis, another research group, also downgraded its revenue forecast, targeting $6 billion less than 2021, due to drops in the world’s biggest markets, namely the US, China and Japan.Story continuesEven the leaders behind the mobile gaming revolution have seen their income from app purchases of virtual outfits and in-game currencies drop by as much as 20%, according to the Financial Times.Changes are on the horizon for Big TechLast year, 97% of mobile web browsing was on browsers that are powered by Apple or Google's software, but their dominance will be investigated by the UK’s competition regulator, potentially bringing changes to the industry, along with new limitations.Last year, Apple’s new restrictions on targeted advertising erased billions of dollars from advertising revenues on largest platforms including Facebook, Twitter, Snapchat and YouTube, with the gaming industry still grappling with this blow. Many developers that thrived on using behavioral data to target players who were likely to spend significant funds in their gaming universe literally lost this income source altogether.A different set of rulesUnlike in other industries, VR or AI is not as important in the world of mobile gaming because only quality content can keep gamers engaged. Market players know this which is why Nintendo (OTC: NTDOY) has released generous amounts of content this year despite delays and component shortages that harmed the console sales of Nintendo. Unfortunately for Nintendo, content alone is not enough to protect the bottom line.OutlookAlthough FIFA and the holiday season always help to boost sales, it’s usually only the top sellers like Microsoft who get to benefit. Microsoft reported that gaming revenues increased 4% with Xbox hardware sales rising 13% in the first quarter of fiscal 2023. But turning the fortune of the industry is a different matter even for Microsoft.Positive news are always a good sign for the holiday season and not only for Microsoft as in the case of Activision Blizzard (NASDAQ: ATVI) whose Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 (2022) instantly became the top game of the month. Electronic Arts' sales have been getting a boost from FIFA 23.But financial figures are what matters at the end of the day and numbers don’t lie. Even Roblox (NASDAQ: RBLX)’s November update showed slowing growth as revenue declined YoY due to the strength of the U.S. dollar.Although new releases always give the top line a boost, the gaming industry altogether is facing a broader weakness and an entirely new set of factors shaping its macroenvironment. Only time will show its ability to play the new “game” that is in the making.See more from BenzingaGlobal Semiconductor Race Is Turning Into a WarLegacy Automakers Keep Taking Pages From Tesla's Playbook Despite CEO ControversyDon't miss real-time alerts on your stocks - join Benzinga Pro for free!

(NASDAQ:WBA) can tell us which group is most powerful. We can see that institutions own the lion's share in the company with 59% ownership. Put another way, the group faces the maximum upside potential (or downside risk).And institutional investors endured the highest losses after the company's share price fell by 4.9% last week. The recent loss, which adds to a one-year loss of 16% for stockholders, may not sit well with this group of investors. Institutions or ""liquidity providers"" control large sums of money and therefore, these types of investors usually have a lot of influence over stock price movements. As a result, if the downtrend continues, institutions may face pressures to sell Walgreens Boots Alliance, which might have negative implications on individual investors.Let's delve deeper into each type of owner of Walgreens Boots Alliance, beginning with the chart below. View our latest analysis for Walgreens Boots Alliance ownership-breakdownWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Walgreens Boots Alliance?Institutions typically measure themselves against a benchmark when reporting to their own investors, so they often become more enthusiastic about a stock once it's included in a major index. We would expect most companies to have some institutions on the register, especially if they are growing.We can see that Walgreens Boots Alliance does have institutional investors; and they hold a good portion of the company's stock. This implies the analysts working for those institutions have looked at the stock and they like it. But just like anyone else, they could be wrong. If multiple institutions change their view on a stock at the same time, you could see the share price drop fast. It's therefore worth looking at Walgreens Boots Alliance's earnings history below. Of course, the future is what really matters.earnings-and-revenue-growthInstitutional investors own over 50% of the company, so together than can probably strongly influence board decisions. Walgreens Boots Alliance is not owned by hedge funds. The company's largest shareholder is Newcip S.A., with ownership of 17%. The Vanguard Group, Inc. is the second largest shareholder owning 7.3% of common stock, and BlackRock, Inc. holds about 6.8% of the company stock.Story continuesA closer look at our ownership figures suggests that the top 16 shareholders have a combined ownership of 50% implying that no single shareholder has a majority.While it makes sense to study institutional ownership data for a company, it also makes sense to study analyst sentiments to know which way the wind is blowing. There are a reasonable number of analysts covering the stock, so it might be useful to find out their aggregate view on the future.Insider Ownership Of Walgreens Boots AllianceThe definition of company insiders can be subjective and does vary between jurisdictions. Our data reflects individual insiders, capturing board members at the very least. Management ultimately answers to the board. However, it is not uncommon for managers to be executive board members, especially if they are a founder or the CEO.Most consider insider ownership a positive because it can indicate the board is well aligned with other shareholders. However, on some occasions too much power is concentrated within this group.Our information suggests that Walgreens Boots Alliance, Inc. insiders own under 1% of the company. But they may have an indirect interest through a corporate structure that we haven't picked up on. It is a very large company, so it would be surprising to see insiders own a large proportion of the company. Though their holding amounts to less than 1%, we can see that board members collectively own US$174m worth of shares (at current prices). In this sort of situation, it can be more interesting to  see if those insiders have been buying or selling. General Public OwnershipThe general public, who are usually individual investors, hold a 24% stake in Walgreens Boots Alliance. While this group can't necessarily call the shots, it can certainly have a real influence on how the company is run.Private Company OwnershipOur data indicates that Private Companies hold 17%, of the company's shares. It's hard to draw any conclusions from this fact alone, so its worth looking into who owns those private companies. Sometimes insiders or other related parties have an interest in shares in a public company through a separate private company.Next Steps:I find it very interesting to look at who exactly owns a company. But to truly gain insight, we need to consider other information, too. To that end, you should learn about the   3 warning signs  we've spotted with Walgreens Boots Alliance (including 1 which is significant) .If you are like me, you may want to think about whether this company will grow or shrink.

76,e82502a0-1a21-30cb-9215-39520403034b,SBUX,2022-12-20,12 Countries That Produce the Best Coffee in the World,Insider Monkey,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/12-countries-produce-best-coffee-211749048.html,1671484669,STORY,"['KC=F', 'SJM', 'SBUX', 'MNST', 'MCD', 'KHC']","[In this piece, we will take a look at the twelve countries that produce the best coffee in the world. For more companies, head on over to 5 Countries That Produce the Best Coffee in the World. Coffee is one of the most popular beverages in the world, and one with a long history, with the first mention of the drink tracing its way back to the tenth century CE. Since then, it has been used for its medicinal properties that helped with concentration and as a social activity to allow people to congregate at coffee shops. Global coffee consumption is booming, and according to estimates by the International Coffee Organization (ICO) consumption in the twelve months that ended in September 2022 is slated to sit at a whopping 170.3 million bags. However, despite this, a global coffee shortfall will continue, with a production of 167.2 million bags expected to stay behind the consumption.Automation and industrial engineering are changing the way farmers plant, monitor, and harvest their products, and the coffee industry is no exception. For instance, coffee farmers in Brazil are employing automation throughout the planting and harvesting processes. The machines that harvest coffee use the global positioning system (GPS) to allow farmers to keep track of the equipment and cameras to analyze the plant. Of course, this is just rudimentary technology compared to today's standards, and leading edge research into coffee production is now studying hyperspectral imaging for a variety of purposes. For instance, researchers have shown that a visible near (VIS-NIR) infrared sensor can be used to map out coffee plants to inspect them for insect damage.What's more is that this research also uses algorithms to let computers pick out the relevant damage patterns through just three image bands, with the initial subset of bands being selected through principle component analysis (PCA) - a basic type of machine learning. The same imaging processes can also be used to map out different coffee bean varieties, removing a large burden from farmers who previously had to crush the bean to find out its type and kind. In fact, coffee bean spectral imaging has been shown to achieve an 80% accuracy in identifying the right kind of bean. The use of technology to aid farmers with their quality gauging needs has also been commercialized, with Colombian firm Demetria providing farmers the tools to map out their bean profile with infrared light and then determine which bean they have come across through using an artificial intelligence platform. The company also provides technology that allows farmers to sift out high quality coffee bean stems by using handheld gadgets. The firm raised $3 million in 2021 to allow it to develop an automated platform for mapping out coffee beans based on acidity, flavor, and aroma by creating digital footprints.Story continuesAs far as the overall market goes, ICO estimates that global coffee exports stood at 9.7 million bags in October this year, marking a drop from the 9.87 bags exported in October 2021. According to Expert Market Research, the global coffee market was worth $114 billion in 2020 and it will grow at a compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) of 4.8% between 2018 to 2022. Out of the different product categories, the research firm estimates that instant coffee will hold the greatest market share, not only because it is easy and less time consuming to prepare, but also because it is good for metabolism and contains relatively lower amounts of caffeine. The research firm further outlines that increasing awareness of coffee's health benefits and a shift toward sustainable innovations for delivery will stimulate growth. Leading coffee producers and sellers are Starbucks Corporation (NASDAQ:SBUX), Monster Beverage Corporation (NASDAQ:MNST), McDonald’s Corporation (NYSE:MCD), The Kraft Heinz Company (NASDAQ:KHC), The J.M. Smucker Company (NYSE:SJM), and Nestlé S.A. (SWX:NESN.SW).Our Methodology We used global trade data segregated on the basis of the harmonized tariff schedule to see which countries export the best coffee. Overall, this data agrees with the ICO's assessment that coffee exports are declining, with the $36 billion of exports in 2021 falling by $144 million annually.Countries That Produce the Best Coffee in the World12. Netherlands Coffee Exports in 2021: $906 millionThe Netherlands is a European country with a $10.6 billion coffee market in 2020. The largest portion of the Dutch coffee market is the filtered coffee market with coffee capsules coming in second place. Additionally, the Dutch coffee market is expected to grow to $13 billion in 2027. The country is also known for its popular coffee shops, which are known globally for allowing visitors to legally consume cannabis in addition to coffee as well. Perhaps the most famous Dutch coffee brand is JDE Peet's N.V. (AMS:JDEP.AS)'s Douwe Egberts coffee. Douwe Egberts is one of the oldest coffee brands in the world, as it was initially set up in 1753 in the Netherlands. The Dutch have also played a vital role in the globalization of coffee, as they were one of the first to sell it out of the Middle East despite governments trying their best to prevent exports. The Netherlands exported $906 million of coffee in 2021, for 127,077 tons.11. Republic of Guatemala Coffee Exports in 2021: $928 millionThe Republic of Guatemala is a Central American country that is also the most populous in the region. Coffee plays a vital role in the country's economy, as it often ranks as its second largest export. The industry itself consists mostly of small farmers so much so that large growers often find themselves squeezed out due to poor profit margins. 96% of Guatemalan production in 2021 was of Arabica coffee beans. Some top coffee producing regions in the country are Nueva Oriente, San Marcos, and Huehuetenango - with the last being one of the highest coffee producing regions in the world at an altitude of 6,500 feet. Guatemalan coffee is used by big brands such as Starbucks Corporation (NASDAQ:SBUX) at its locations, particularly in the United States.10. Kingdom of Belgium Coffee Exports in 2021: $1 billionThe Kingdom of Belgium, or simply Belgium, is one of the most prosperous nations in the world with high standards of living. According to research from the European Union, the country was Europe's third largest importer of green coffee as of 2021. This is coffee that is an extract from unroasted coffee beans. Belgium's Port of Antwerp is capable of storing a whopping 250,000 tons of coffee - unsurprising since Belgium alone exported 296,050 tons of coffee in 2021. The country's coffee industry was worth $3.5 billion in 2022, and it is expected to grow at a CAGR of 8.34% by 2025. One of Belgium's largest and oldest coffee companies is the Miko NV (EBR:MIKO.BR), which traces its roots back to the 1900s and is headquartered in Turnhout.As coffee consumption in Europe grows, companies like Starbucks Corporation (NASDAQ:SBUX), Monster Beverage Corporation (NASDAQ:MNST), McDonald’s Corporation (NYSE:MCD), The Kraft Heinz Company (NASDAQ:KHC) and The J.M. Smucker Company (NYSE:SJM) are set to profit from this segment of the industry.9. Federal Democratic Republic of Ethiopia Coffee Exports in 2021: $1.19 billionThe Federal Democratic Republic of Ethiopia is a landlocked Eastern European country that is often called the 'motherland' of coffee. This is due to the fact that the popular Arabica coffee bean is thought to have originated in the country. Coffee is grown in Ethiopia in primarily four regions. These are the Harrar, Sidama, Yirgacheffe, and Southwest regions. Out of these, Sidama is often called the birthplace of coffee. Ethiopian coffee beans include Longberry, Shortberry, and Mocha - with Longberry being the highest quality bean. Like other African coffee producers, Ethiopia is known for its private distributors instead of brands that sell the drink to consumers. Coffee from these companies is used by Starbucks, Forest Coffee, and others. Some top Ethiopian coffee distributors are Ambassa Enterprises, Shecha Coffee, and Garden of Coffee.8. Republic of Honduras Coffee Exports in 2021: $1.29 billionThe Republic of Honduras is a Central American country with a $49 billion economy and one that is rich in mineral resources. Agriculture is the backbone of the Honduran economy, with coffee exports often accounting for a large chunk of its foreign currency earnings. The country has six coffee growing regions, which are Opalaca, Comayagua, Montecillos, Agalta, El Paraiso, and Copan. Honduran coffee packaging often features pictures of the region where it was grown, and some coffee companies are Beneficio De Cafe Montecristo S.A., Cafes Finos De Exportacion S. De R.L., Beneficio De Cafe Inloher S. De, and Lurvin Radames Ventura Sagastume.7. French Republic Coffee Exports in 2021: $1.4 billionThe French Republic is a European country that is one of the most prosperous nations in the world. The French coffee industry is worth $12 billion in 2022, and it is expected to grow at a 4.4% CAGR between 2022 to 2025. Since France was one of the old colonial powers,  it also played a central role in spreading coffee all over the world. Additionally, one of the first coffee makers was invented in France in the 1800s. Some well known French coffee roasters are Café Lomi, Hexagone Café, Partisan Café Artisanal, and The Beans on Fire.6. Italian Republic Coffee Exports in 2021: $2 billionThe Italian Republic is another European country with a large economy and one that is known for a strong food industry. Like Italian wine and cheese, Italian coffee has also made its mark on the world. The country's coffee industry was worth $3.7 billion in 2020, and it is expected to grow and sit at $4.4 billion in 2024. Italy is also home to one of the oldest and largest coffee companies in the world, Luigi Lavazza S.p.A. Like other Italian businesses, Lavazza is also a family run enterprise. Some famous Italian coffee roasters are His Majesty the Coffee and Picapau Coffee Roastery. Due to a rise in coffee consumption, coffee sellers like Starbucks Corporation (NASDAQ:SBUX), Monster Beverage Corporation (NASDAQ:MNST), McDonald’s Corporation (NYSE:MCD), The Kraft Heinz Company (NASDAQ:KHC) and The J.M. Smucker Company (NYSE:SJM) are seeing high coffee sales all over the world. Click to continue reading and see 5 Countries That Produce the Best Coffee in the World.  Suggested Articles:12 Countries That Produce the Best Cheese in the World12 Dividend stocks That Outperform S&amp;P 50013 Biggest Meat Processing Companies in the USDisclosure: None. 12 Countries That Produce the Best Coffee in the World is originally published on Insider Monkey.]"

The company’s diversified business has also been a driver. The impact of these upsides was visible in the company’s first-quarter fiscal 2023 results, wherein the top and bottom lines grew year over year and the former came ahead of the Zacks Consensus Estimate.The company saw a double-digit rise in earnings and sales as it efficiently managed inflation and witnessed a case volume increase and higher market share. On its first-quarter earnings call, management stated that it remains optimistic about its business while remaining cautious of the macroeconomic landscape.Factors Backing SyscoSysco has been focused on its Recipe for Growth, which is strengthening the company’s capacities across sales and the supply chain. The program involves five strategic priorities aimed at enabling SYY to grow 1.5 times faster than the market by FY24 end. The five strategic pillars include enhancing customers’ experience via digital tools. In this regard, the company’s Sysco Shop platform and the new pricing software are working well.Further, Sysco is focused on improving the supply chain to cater to customers efficiently and consistently with better delivery and omnichannel inventory management. Next, Sysco aims at providing customer-oriented merchandising and marketing solutions to augment sales.The company also targets team-based selling, with an emphasis on important cuisines. Finally, Sysco is focused on cultivating new capacities, channels and segments alongside sponsoring investments via cost-saving initiatives.Sysco Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS SurpriseSysco Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS SurpriseSysco Corporation price-consensus-eps-surprise-chart | Sysco Corporation QuoteSysco is a diversified company, which covers every part of the food away from home market. The company’s operations are diversified across different customer types, product categories and geographies.Sysco caters to restaurants of all price-point spectrums and types. It also caters to health care and education facilities, alongside travel and recreation facilities in office buildings. Travel and recreation facilities are seeing a continued revival and are likely to be a growth area in the coming years.Moreover, Sysco has been carrying out various acquisitions over the years to grow its distribution network and customer base and boost long-term growth. In February 2022, the company concluded the acquisition of The Coastal Companies, which operates under Sysco’s specialty produce business – FreshPoint. Before this, SYY acquired Greco and Sons in the first quarter of fiscal 2022. We note that these acquisitions go in tandem with Sysco’s Recipe for Growth.Story continuesCost Woes PersistSysco has been encountering product cost inflation in the U.S. Foodservice unit for a while now. In the first quarter of fiscal 2023, the company witnessed product cost inflation of 9.7%, which was measured by estimated changes in product costs, mainly in the dairy and frozen categories. The U.S. Broadline saw 12% product cost inflation, which was measured by estimated changes in product costs, mainly in the dairy and frozen categories. The persistence of such trends poses threats to margins.For fiscal 2023, management earlier projected inflation in the mid-single digits across all categories. Sysco also expects increased operating costs in the fiscal year due to transformation investments and a tough hiring landscape.The Bottom LineWe believe that the abovementioned upsides are likely to help Sysco tide over cost hurdles. On its last earnings call, management reiterated its adjusted earnings per share guidance range of $4.09-$4.39 for fiscal 2023, suggesting 26-35% growth from the year-ago period. Sysco remains on track to grow more than 1.35 times the market in fiscal 2023.Shares of this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company have dipped 1.1% in the past three months against the industry’s growth of 8.6%.Looking for Consumer Staple Stocks?

Even for these last few days, market participants are not sure in which direction the U.S. stock markets will move. Investors are skeptical of a year-end rally — popularly known as Santa Claus Rally — for this year.These negative sentiments arise as recession fears grip markets resulting from the fact that the Fed has so far failed to cool inflation to an acceptable level despite hiking the benchmark interest rate by 4.25% in 2022 along with other monetary tightening measures like termination of the $120 billion per month quantitative easing program and gradual shrinking of the $9 trillion balance sheet.At this stage, it would be prudent to pick value stocks with a favorable Zacks Rank to cushion the portfolio as well as make some gains from the upside potential. These stocks could prove to be valuable once the rally resumes. Five of them are Archer-Daniels-Midland Co. ADM, H&amp;E Equipment Services Inc. HEES, Veritiv Corp. VRTV, U.S. Silica Holdings Inc. SLCA and Barrett Business Services Inc. BBSI.Recession Fears Grip MarketsU.S. stocks continued to suffer in the last two weeks after the Fed announced a 50-basis point rate hike, with losses deepening. Stocks took a further hit as disappointing retail sales for November sparked fears of a slowing economy.On Dec 14, the Fed increased interest rates by another 50 basis points. Fed Chair Jerome Powell had earlier hinted that the central bank could slow down its pace of rate hikes after increasing interest rates by 75 basis points for the fourth consecutive time since June.The Fed did slow down the pace but Powell did not paint a rosy picture for the future. In fact, Powell indicated that the central bank would continue increasing interest rates at regular intervals through 2023.Wednesday’s hike took the benchmark range of 4.25% to 4.50%, and the Fed projected it to top out at 5.25% before it takes a call on pausing the hikes. This is higher than the September forecast of 4.75%.    Story continuesRecession fears were further ignited after central banks in Europe also hinted at hiking interest rates through 2023. Both the Bank of England and the European Central Bank slowed down their pace of rate hikes but increased interest rates by 50 basis points. Investors were once again alarmed by this as they believe that the ongoing rate increases could push the UK and Eurozone into a recession, setting the tone for a panic sell-off.Our Top PicksAt this juncture, investors should be prepared to minimize fluctuations in their portfolio and consequently rebalance it with suitable financial assets to maintain stability.

82,e82502a0-1a21-30cb-9215-39520403034b,MNST,2022-12-20,12 Countries That Produce the Best Coffee in the World,Insider Monkey,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/12-countries-produce-best-coffee-211749048.html,1671484669,STORY,['MNST'],"[In this piece, we will take a look at the twelve countries that produce the best coffee in the world. For more companies, head on over to 5 Countries That Produce the Best Coffee in the World. Coffee is one of the most popular beverages in the world, and one with a long history, with the first mention of the drink tracing its way back to the tenth century CE. Since then, it has been used for its medicinal properties that helped with concentration and as a social activity to allow people to congregate at coffee shops. Global coffee consumption is booming, and according to estimates by the International Coffee Organization (ICO) consumption in the twelve months that ended in September 2022 is slated to sit at a whopping 170.3 million bags. However, despite this, a global coffee shortfall will continue, with a production of 167.2 million bags expected to stay behind the consumption.Automation and industrial engineering are changing the way farmers plant, monitor, and harvest their products, and the coffee industry is no exception. For instance, coffee farmers in Brazil are employing automation throughout the planting and harvesting processes. The machines that harvest coffee use the global positioning system (GPS) to allow farmers to keep track of the equipment and cameras to analyze the plant. Of course, this is just rudimentary technology compared to today's standards, and leading edge research into coffee production is now studying hyperspectral imaging for a variety of purposes. For instance, researchers have shown that a visible near (VIS-NIR) infrared sensor can be used to map out coffee plants to inspect them for insect damage.What's more is that this research also uses algorithms to let computers pick out the relevant damage patterns through just three image bands, with the initial subset of bands being selected through principle component analysis (PCA) - a basic type of machine learning. The same imaging processes can also be used to map out different coffee bean varieties, removing a large burden from farmers who previously had to crush the bean to find out its type and kind. In fact, coffee bean spectral imaging has been shown to achieve an 80% accuracy in identifying the right kind of bean. The use of technology to aid farmers with their quality gauging needs has also been commercialized, with Colombian firm Demetria providing farmers the tools to map out their bean profile with infrared light and then determine which bean they have come across through using an artificial intelligence platform. The company also provides technology that allows farmers to sift out high quality coffee bean stems by using handheld gadgets. The firm raised $3 million in 2021 to allow it to develop an automated platform for mapping out coffee beans based on acidity, flavor, and aroma by creating digital footprints.Story continuesAs far as the overall market goes, ICO estimates that global coffee exports stood at 9.7 million bags in October this year, marking a drop from the 9.87 bags exported in October 2021. According to Expert Market Research, the global coffee market was worth $114 billion in 2020 and it will grow at a compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) of 4.8% between 2018 to 2022. Out of the different product categories, the research firm estimates that instant coffee will hold the greatest market share, not only because it is easy and less time consuming to prepare, but also because it is good for metabolism and contains relatively lower amounts of caffeine. The research firm further outlines that increasing awareness of coffee's health benefits and a shift toward sustainable innovations for delivery will stimulate growth. Leading coffee producers and sellers are Starbucks Corporation (NASDAQ:SBUX), Monster Beverage Corporation (NASDAQ:MNST), McDonald’s Corporation (NYSE:MCD), The Kraft Heinz Company (NASDAQ:KHC), The J.M. Smucker Company (NYSE:SJM), and Nestlé S.A. (SWX:NESN.SW).Our Methodology We used global trade data segregated on the basis of the harmonized tariff schedule to see which countries export the best coffee. Overall, this data agrees with the ICO's assessment that coffee exports are declining, with the $36 billion of exports in 2021 falling by $144 million annually.Countries That Produce the Best Coffee in the World12. Netherlands Coffee Exports in 2021: $906 millionThe Netherlands is a European country with a $10.6 billion coffee market in 2020. The largest portion of the Dutch coffee market is the filtered coffee market with coffee capsules coming in second place. Additionally, the Dutch coffee market is expected to grow to $13 billion in 2027. The country is also known for its popular coffee shops, which are known globally for allowing visitors to legally consume cannabis in addition to coffee as well. Perhaps the most famous Dutch coffee brand is JDE Peet's N.V. (AMS:JDEP.AS)'s Douwe Egberts coffee. Douwe Egberts is one of the oldest coffee brands in the world, as it was initially set up in 1753 in the Netherlands. The Dutch have also played a vital role in the globalization of coffee, as they were one of the first to sell it out of the Middle East despite governments trying their best to prevent exports. The Netherlands exported $906 million of coffee in 2021, for 127,077 tons.11. Republic of Guatemala Coffee Exports in 2021: $928 millionThe Republic of Guatemala is a Central American country that is also the most populous in the region. Coffee plays a vital role in the country's economy, as it often ranks as its second largest export. The industry itself consists mostly of small farmers so much so that large growers often find themselves squeezed out due to poor profit margins. 96% of Guatemalan production in 2021 was of Arabica coffee beans. Some top coffee producing regions in the country are Nueva Oriente, San Marcos, and Huehuetenango - with the last being one of the highest coffee producing regions in the world at an altitude of 6,500 feet. Guatemalan coffee is used by big brands such as Starbucks Corporation (NASDAQ:SBUX) at its locations, particularly in the United States.10. Kingdom of Belgium Coffee Exports in 2021: $1 billionThe Kingdom of Belgium, or simply Belgium, is one of the most prosperous nations in the world with high standards of living. According to research from the European Union, the country was Europe's third largest importer of green coffee as of 2021. This is coffee that is an extract from unroasted coffee beans. Belgium's Port of Antwerp is capable of storing a whopping 250,000 tons of coffee - unsurprising since Belgium alone exported 296,050 tons of coffee in 2021. The country's coffee industry was worth $3.5 billion in 2022, and it is expected to grow at a CAGR of 8.34% by 2025. One of Belgium's largest and oldest coffee companies is the Miko NV (EBR:MIKO.BR), which traces its roots back to the 1900s and is headquartered in Turnhout.As coffee consumption in Europe grows, companies like Starbucks Corporation (NASDAQ:SBUX), Monster Beverage Corporation (NASDAQ:MNST), McDonald’s Corporation (NYSE:MCD), The Kraft Heinz Company (NASDAQ:KHC) and The J.M. Smucker Company (NYSE:SJM) are set to profit from this segment of the industry.9. Federal Democratic Republic of Ethiopia Coffee Exports in 2021: $1.19 billionThe Federal Democratic Republic of Ethiopia is a landlocked Eastern European country that is often called the 'motherland' of coffee. This is due to the fact that the popular Arabica coffee bean is thought to have originated in the country. Coffee is grown in Ethiopia in primarily four regions. These are the Harrar, Sidama, Yirgacheffe, and Southwest regions. Out of these, Sidama is often called the birthplace of coffee. Ethiopian coffee beans include Longberry, Shortberry, and Mocha - with Longberry being the highest quality bean. Like other African coffee producers, Ethiopia is known for its private distributors instead of brands that sell the drink to consumers. Coffee from these companies is used by Starbucks, Forest Coffee, and others. Some top Ethiopian coffee distributors are Ambassa Enterprises, Shecha Coffee, and Garden of Coffee.8. Republic of Honduras Coffee Exports in 2021: $1.29 billionThe Republic of Honduras is a Central American country with a $49 billion economy and one that is rich in mineral resources. Agriculture is the backbone of the Honduran economy, with coffee exports often accounting for a large chunk of its foreign currency earnings. The country has six coffee growing regions, which are Opalaca, Comayagua, Montecillos, Agalta, El Paraiso, and Copan. Honduran coffee packaging often features pictures of the region where it was grown, and some coffee companies are Beneficio De Cafe Montecristo S.A., Cafes Finos De Exportacion S. De R.L., Beneficio De Cafe Inloher S. De, and Lurvin Radames Ventura Sagastume.7. French Republic Coffee Exports in 2021: $1.4 billionThe French Republic is a European country that is one of the most prosperous nations in the world. The French coffee industry is worth $12 billion in 2022, and it is expected to grow at a 4.4% CAGR between 2022 to 2025. Since France was one of the old colonial powers,  it also played a central role in spreading coffee all over the world. Additionally, one of the first coffee makers was invented in France in the 1800s. Some well known French coffee roasters are Café Lomi, Hexagone Café, Partisan Café Artisanal, and The Beans on Fire.6. Italian Republic Coffee Exports in 2021: $2 billionThe Italian Republic is another European country with a large economy and one that is known for a strong food industry. Like Italian wine and cheese, Italian coffee has also made its mark on the world. The country's coffee industry was worth $3.7 billion in 2020, and it is expected to grow and sit at $4.4 billion in 2024. Italy is also home to one of the oldest and largest coffee companies in the world, Luigi Lavazza S.p.A. Like other Italian businesses, Lavazza is also a family run enterprise. Some famous Italian coffee roasters are His Majesty the Coffee and Picapau Coffee Roastery. Due to a rise in coffee consumption, coffee sellers like Starbucks Corporation (NASDAQ:SBUX), Monster Beverage Corporation (NASDAQ:MNST), McDonald’s Corporation (NYSE:MCD), The Kraft Heinz Company (NASDAQ:KHC) and The J.M. Smucker Company (NYSE:SJM) are seeing high coffee sales all over the world. Click to continue reading and see 5 Countries That Produce the Best Coffee in the World.  Suggested Articles:12 Countries That Produce the Best Cheese in the World12 Dividend stocks That Outperform S&amp;P 50013 Biggest Meat Processing Companies in the USDisclosure: None. 12 Countries That Produce the Best Coffee in the World is originally published on Insider Monkey.]"

But every investor is virtually certain to have both over-performing and under-performing stocks. At this point some shareholders may be questioning their investment in Host Hotels &amp; Resorts, Inc. (NASDAQ:HST), since the last five years saw the share price fall 16%.If the past week is anything to go by, investor sentiment for Host Hotels &amp; Resorts isn't positive, so let's see if there's a mismatch between fundamentals and the share price. View our latest analysis for Host Hotels &amp; Resorts In his essay The Superinvestors of Graham-and-Doddsville Warren Buffett described how share prices do not always rationally reflect the value of a business. One flawed but reasonable way to assess how sentiment around a company has changed is to compare the earnings per share (EPS) with the share price.During five years of share price growth, Host Hotels &amp; Resorts moved from a loss to profitability. Most would consider that to be a good thing, so it's counter-intuitive to see the share price declining. Other metrics might give us a better handle on how its value is changing over time.Arguably, the revenue drop of 16% a year for half a decade suggests that the company can't grow in the long term. This has probably encouraged some shareholders to sell down the stock.You can see below how earnings and revenue have changed over time (discover the exact values by clicking on the image).earnings-and-revenue-growthHost Hotels &amp; Resorts is well known by investors, and plenty of clever analysts have tried to predict the future profit levels. You can see what analysts are predicting for Host Hotels &amp; Resorts in this interactive graph of future profit estimates.What About Dividends?As well as measuring the share price return, investors should also consider the total shareholder return (TSR). Whereas the share price return only reflects the change in the share price, the TSR includes the value of dividends (assuming they were reinvested) and the benefit of any discounted capital raising or spin-off. Arguably, the TSR gives a more comprehensive picture of the return generated by a stock. As it happens, Host Hotels &amp; Resorts' TSR for the last 5 years was -3.4%, which exceeds the share price return mentioned earlier. And there's no prize for guessing that the dividend payments largely explain the divergence!Story continuesA Different PerspectiveWe're pleased to report that Host Hotels &amp; Resorts shareholders have received a total shareholder return of 11% over one year. Of course, that includes the dividend. There's no doubt those recent returns are much better than the TSR loss of 0.7% per year over five years. We generally put more weight on the long term performance over the short term, but the recent improvement could hint at a (positive) inflection point within the business. While it is well worth considering the different impacts that market conditions can have on the share price, there are other factors that are even more important.

86,410d03e6-05ce-327e-8a44-8d9276a6ce0c,LUV,2022-12-20,3 Stocks Worth a Look From the Promising Airline Industry,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/3-stocks-worth-look-promising-130901560.html,1671455341,STORY,"['LUV', 'DAL', 'UAL', '^GSPC']","[Stocks in the Zacks Airline industry are being well served by a buoyant scenario backed by air-travel demand. Air-travel demand made a stronger-than-expected recovery as people are again booking flights, thereby boosting passenger revenues, which account for the bulk of most airlines’ top lines. Airline players like Southwest Airlines LUV, Delta Air Lines DAL and United Airlines UAL are likely to benefit from robust demand for air travel.However, high fuel costs are limiting bottom-line growth. Moreover, the labor crunch that is currently being faced by the airline industry is another woe.About the IndustryAbout the IndustryThe Zacks Airline industry includes players engaged in transporting passengers and cargo to various destinations globally. Most operators maintain a fleet of multiple mainline jets in addition to several regional planes. Operations are aided by their regional airline subsidiaries and third-party regional carriers. Additionally, industry players utilize their respective cargo divisions to offer a wide range of freight and mail services. The players invest substantially to upgrade technology. The industry, apart from comprising legacy carriers, includes low-cost players. The well-being of companies in this group is linked to the health of the overall economy. For example, the aviation space was one of the worst pandemic-hit corners, with passenger revenues taking a severe beating. However, air-travel demand is rosy now.The focus on boosting cargo revenues is an added positive.Key Themes Governing the Airline IndustryIATA’s Bullish Forecast: Following the removal of coronavirus-induced restrictions, pent-up demand is driving traffic for the airlines. Despite inflationary pressures and supply-chain woes, there is a wave of optimism surrounding air-travel demand. The buoyant scenario with respect to air-travel demand is expected to improve further in 2023. As a result, airlines are expected to return to profitability next year. Per the International Air Transport Association (IATA), net profits for airlines across the globe are likely to be $4.7 billion in 2023. The top line next year is anticipated to be $779 billion compared with the current-year estimate of $727 billion.Story continuesWith people again taking to the skies, the greatest driver of top-line improvement is passenger revenues. Per IATA, passenger revenues for the next year are anticipated to be $522 billion (85.5% of 2019 [pre-coronavirus] levels). The 2023 projection is higher than the current-year estimate of $438 billion, despite economic uncertainties.Bottom Line Suffers Due to Oil Price Increase: Even though oil price declined from its multi-year highs due to recession fears, it remains high. Notably, oil prices increased 5.7% in the first nine months of 2022, induced by the Russia-Ukraine war. Per IATA’s December forecast, the current-year fuel bill for the industry is projected at $222 billion, higher than the forecast of $192 billion made in June.Focus on Cargo Revenues: An Added Positive: The focus of airlines on boosting cargo revenues bodes well for top-line growth, especially in the current scenario where passenger revenues are rebounding strongly from the pandemic lows. Per IATA’s forecast, cargo revenues are expected to be $201.4 billion. That is an improvement in 2022, which is way above the 2019 actual of $100.8 billion. Cargo revenues in 2023 are expected to be $149.4 billion, which is lower than the current-year projection but still $48.6 billion higher than the 2019 actuals.Staffing Crunch a Bane: The airline industry in the United States is being plagued by tensions on the labor front. With airlines trimming their labor force substantially during the peak of the pandemic, the industry is grappling with a staff crunch as demand bounces back. Due to labor scarcity, many U.S. airlines trimmed their capacity, which in turn, is likely to drain profitability. Reduced capacity is pushing up non-fuel unit costs. IATA expects total costs in 2023 to increase 5.3% to 5.3% to $776 billion. The increase is likely to be mainly due to labor, skill and capacity shortages.Zacks Industry Rank Indicates Sunny ProspectsThe Zacks Airline industry is a 29-stock group within the broader Zacks Transportation sector.

Fleet-modernization efforts of LUV are encouraging as well. Following the lifting of restrictions under the CARES Act, which prohibited airlines from paying dividends till Sep 30, 2022, Southwest Airlines’ management reinstated its quarterly dividend of 18 cents per share. With the carrier returning to profitability in March 2022 and expecting to be profitable for full-year 2022 as well, the decision was hugely expected. The dividend will be paid on Jan 31, 2023 to its shareholders of record at the close of business on Jan 10.Southwest Airlines’ earnings outshined the Zacks Consensus Estimate in each of the last four quarters. The average beat is 54.7%. Over the past 60 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2022 earnings has moved 3.1% north at LUV.

Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: Amazon.com, Inc. AMZN, Novartis AG NVS, Philip Morris International Inc. PM, Automatic Data Processing, Inc. ADP and Live Nation Entertainment, Inc. LYV.Here are highlights from Friday’s Analyst Blog:Top Analyst Reports for Amazon, Novartis and Philip MorrisThe Zacks Research Daily presents the best research output of our analyst team. Today's Research Daily features new research reports on 16 major stocks, including Amazon.com, Inc., Novartis AG and Philip Morris International Inc. These research reports have been hand-picked from the roughly 70 reports published by our analyst team today.You can see all of today's research reports here &gt;&gt;&gt;Amazon.com shares have been big laggards this year, on account primarily of two distinct factors.First, Amazon's growth outlook has gotten cloudier as a result of the uncertain macroeconomic backdrop resulting from the Fed's extraordinary tightening policy that has raised recessionary risks for the U.S. economy. Second, Amazon's near-term growth outlook is weighed down by the pulled-forward growth during Covid. The company heavily invested in human and physical capacity during Covid that has produced somewhat of a mismatch between 'capacity' and demand growth that they are currently in the process of rationalizing through lay-offs and facility shutdowns.The stock is down -47.9% this year vs. the -17.2% decline for the S&amp;P 500 index and the Zacks Retail sector's -26.5% pullback. Amazon's main Retail sector rival Walmart is up +4.8% this year. Nevertheless, Amazon's third quarter results were driven by Prime and AWS momentum. Strengthening AWS services portfolio and its growing adoption rate contributed well.Ultrafast delivery services and expanding content portfolio were beneficial. Strengthening relationship with third-party sellers was a positive. Robust advertising business contributed well. Improving Alexa skills along with robust smart home products offerings were tailwinds.Amazon's strong global presence and solid momentum among the small and medium businesses remain positives. Growing capabilities in grocery, pharmacy, Amazon Care, Kuiper and Zoox are other positives. Considering the abovementioned facts, the Zacks analyst expects 2022 revenue to be up 8.3% from 2021.(You can read the full research report on Amazon.com here &gt;&gt;&gt;)Novartis' shares have gained +5.9% over the past year against the Zacks Large Cap Pharmaceuticals industry's gain of +15.1%. The company's performance in the third quarter was pretty ho-hum, as earnings beat by a penny but revenues lagged due to generic competition.With the planned spin off of Sandoz, Novartis is looking to become a pure-play pharmaceutical company. Novartis has a strong and diverse portfolio. Solid momentum in key brands like psoriasis drug Cosentyx, cardiovascular drug Entresto, gene therapy Zolgensma, the oncology portfolio and the launch of Kesimpta continue to boost performance.The launch of additional drugs like Pluvicto, Piqray, Leqvio and Mayzent and the label expansion of key drugs should also boost performance further. Management's focus on cost savings should boost the bottom line as well. However, generic competition for key drugs and pipeline setbacks are concerns.(You can read the full research report on Novartis here &gt;&gt;&gt;)Philip Morris' shares have outperformed the Zacks Tobacco industry over the past year (+8.4% vs. +3.7%). The company has been benefiting from its strong pricing power. Also, focus on reduced risk products, especially IQOS has been working well for the company, which is witnessing continued product mix shift from cigarettes to smoke-free products. However, Philip Morris has been battling cost-related headwinds. In third-quarter 2022, the proforma adjusted operating income margin fell 1 point on an organic basis.Management lowered its proforma adjusted operating margin organic growth view for 2022, wherein it expects gross margin contraction due to a considerable rise in IQOS device volumes, the increased initial cost of IQOS ILUMA, elevated logistic costs, growth-oriented investments in the smoke-free space, raw material and energy cost inflation and incremental supply-chain costs.(You can read the full research report on Philip Morris here &gt;&gt;&gt;)Other noteworthy reports we are featuring today include Automatic Data Processing, Inc. and Live Nation Entertainment, Inc.Why Haven't You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?

GLOV is managed by Goldman Sachs Funds. Before fees and expenses, GLOV seeks to match the performance of the GOLDMAN SACHS ACTBT WORLD LW VL PL EQ ID.The Goldman Sachs ActiveBeta World Low Vol Plus Equity Index delivers exposure to large and mid-capitalization equity securities of developed market issuers, including the United States.Cost &amp; Other ExpensesInvestors should also pay attention to an ETF's expense ratio. Lower cost products will produce better results than those with a higher cost, assuming all other metrics remain the same.Operating expenses on an annual basis are 0.25% for GLOV, making it one of the cheaper products in the space.Story continuesIt has a 12-month trailing dividend yield of 1.21%.Sector Exposure and Top HoldingsWhile ETFs offer diversified exposure, which minimizes single stock risk, a deep look into a fund's holdings is a valuable exercise. And, most ETFs are very transparent products that disclose their holdings on a daily basis.Taking into account individual holdings, Apple Inc (AAPL) accounts for about 2.95% of the fund's total assets, followed by Microsoft Corp (MSFT) and Oreilly Automotive Inc (ORLY).GLOV's top 10 holdings account for about 14.13% of its total assets under management.Performance and RiskThe ETF has lost about -7.98% so far this year.With about 389 holdings, it effectively diversifies company-specific risk.AlternativesGoldman Sachs ActiveBeta World Low Vol Plus Equity ETF is a reasonable option for investors seeking to outperform the Broad Developed World ETFs segment of the market. However, there are other ETFs in the space which investors could consider.IShares MSCI ACWI ETF (ACWI) tracks MSCI All Country World Index and the Vanguard Total World Stock ETF (VT) tracks FTSE Global All Cap Index. IShares MSCI ACWI ETF has $17.64 billion in assets, Vanguard Total World Stock ETF has $23.49 billion.

GS plans to lay off thousands of employees to survive the current uncertain economic conditions. Per a source familiar with the matter, the number of jobs that will be affected is being discussed and further details will be finalized early next year.According to the source, the move includes hundreds of employees that are being eliminated from the company’s consumer business. GS wants to step back from its consumer business and, hence, has been planning to eliminate at least 400 jobs from its loss-making retail banking operations.In addition to this, the bank plans to stop originating unsecured consumer loans.In October, GS signaled that it was scaling back its ambitions for Marcus, the loss-making consumer unit. Notably, Marcus was moved into Goldman Sachs’ wealth management arm as part of a reorganization of the company’s main business units.The bank’s latest job cut plans come after it cut about 500 employees in September, after pausing the annual practice for two years during the pandemic.With the latest move, Goldman Sachs joins Wall Street firms like Citigroup C and Morgan Stanley MS, who are also slashing jobs as the overall investment banking performance has become weak amid a decline in total deal volume and deal values because of the constant rise in interest rates, the war between Russia and Ukraine, and the red-hot inflation.This year witnessed a slowdown in mergers and acquisitions, and share offerings, which have negatively impacted investment banking revenues.In addition to eliminating dozens of jobs across its investment banking division, Citigroup has been emphasizing growth in core businesses through streamlining operations internationally.Likewise, Morgan Stanley has been trying to restructure operations and focus more on less volatile revenue sources, which have started bearing fruits. MS is focusing more on the wealth management and investment management segments as these are less dependent on the capital markets.Over the past year, shares of Goldman Sachs have lost 6.8% compared with a decline of 7.9% recorded by the industry.Story continues Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment Research Currently, GS carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

A reduction in rates is not seen as likely.""While we believe there is downside risk from fundamentals, we see upside potential from likely improved investor sentiment, ""said Northern Trust Chief Investment Officer Angelo Manioudakis. ""Financial markets will have to balance the immediacy of disappointing global growth against the backdrop of greater certainty on central bank policy, a reduction in interest-rate volatility and the potential of a return to growth later in the year.""Change Among ConstantsThese changing conditions are behind the main message of Northern Trust’s 2023 Outlook being that it will be a ""pivotal"" year, although some conditions will persist.The firm expects growth to continue to be constrained globally, with some regions arguably already in recession and others on the precipice. It also believes that China’s pandemic-to-endemic transition will continue to materially impact the outlook for global economic demand.Investment Themes Drive OutlookNorthern Trust’s 2023 Outlook builds off the firm’s long-term Capital Market Assumptions (CMA) report, a forward-looking, historically aware five-year forecast that guides the firm’s strategic asset allocation recommendations. At the core of the CMA are investment themes, typically five or six, based on forces that Northern Trust identifies as driving markets over the next five years. The six themes from the most recent (August 2022) CMA are reflected throughout the 2023 Outlook. Among them are: ""Slow Growth Transitions,"" ""Inflation Recalibration"" and ""Monetary Drought.""Story continuesThe 2023 Outlook also includes forecasts on a range of asset classes.High Yield Favored in Fixed IncomeNorthern Trust expects the bulk of the increase in interest rates is behind us and notes that the pace at which inflation falls will largely determine the rate path going forward. The firm maintains a neutral bias on duration risk, given limited upside and ongoing interest rate volatility. It prefers credit risk, particularly in the high yield space, given solid yields and decent fundamentals, even in the face of a shallow recession. In fact, high yield remains the firm’s highest conviction tactical overweight in its Global Policy Model, which presents the firms asset allocation recommendations. Investment grade bonds are the largest underweight, despite an expectation that their returns will turn positive in 2023.Equities Reset Amid Weakening of Economic Growth""Equity valuations should be less of a headwind in 2023,"" said Chris Shipley, Northern Trust Asset Management’s chief investment strategist for North America. ""However, we still expect 2023 to be a volatile year for equities across the globe as economic growth and corporate profits disappoint, but sentiment improves as inflation trends lower and central banks eventually pause their rate hike campaigns. Those cross-currents leave us equal-weight developed market equities in our Global Policy Model, but underweight emerging market equities as intermediate-term challenges outweigh a bumpy and uneven reopening of China.""Natural Resources Continue to Play Important RoleJust as real assets did in 2022, Northern Trust expects them to provide valuable diversification benefits to investors. This was especially true for natural resources. ""Specific to natural resources, we have reasserted an overweight given their solid fundamental outlook and the way in which they can act as a hedge against an emerging market equities rebound,"" said Wouter Sturkenboom, Northern Trust Asset Management’s chief investment strategist for Europe, the Middle East, Africa, and the Asia-Pacific region. ""Natural resources seized the day in 2022, and we think they will play an important role in 2023 as well.""The full Northern Trust 2023 Outlook is available at CapitalMarketAssumptions.com/1year.Forward-looking statements and assumptions are Northern Trust’s current estimates or expectations of future events or future results based upon proprietary research and should not be construed as an estimate or promise of results that a portfolio may achieve.

In order to improve the ESG profile and reduce the carbon intensity of a fixed income portfolio, both of the funds apply distinct ESG approaches; one to corporate bonds and another to government bonds. The strategies leverage the same investment process but have different duration targets, giving investors the flexibility they need when managing bond portfolios in a rising interest rate environment.Marie Dzanis, head of NTAM in EMEA, said: ""We're delighted to build on more than 30 years of experience in managing socially responsible portfolios, and combine it with our robust fixed income capabilities, to meet investors' demand for ESG investment solutions that move beyond equity. At NTAM, we believe investors should be compensated for the risks they take - in all market environments and, as we see investors increasingly look to integrate sustainability characteristics into their bond portfolios, we have partnered with Solactive to offer strategies that we believe are a compelling solution to meet their needs.""Timo Pfeiffer, chief markets officer of Solactive, comments: ""In Partnering with NTAM, we designed indices that may offer suitable ways to diversify portfolios in all market environments with indices that target high sustainability standards. This demonstrates our expertise in incorporating cutting-edge exclusion standards into our fixed-income indices, taking us to the next level in sustainable investing. We are pleased to establish this partnership with NTAM.""Story continuesThe NT Global Bond ESG Climate Index Fund and the NT Global 1-5 Years Bond ESG Climate Index Funds, used as benchmarks for the strategies, measure the performance of a global investment grade bond universe and integrates ESG scores and climate data into the government and corporate bonds within the index.

The report, based on the survey conducted in third quarter of 2022, provides an inside view across four key themes on how business owners and entrepreneurs are deploying their wealth and what drives them as they look to the future.The ""New"" RetirementWhile many business owners may be looking forward to downshifting as they approach retirement age, a third of the survey’s respondents (32%) indicated that they are not interested in retiring and plan to be actively involved in their business as long as they can. A full 19% indicated that they do not plan to retire at all and instead intend to work just as hard starting something new, such as building a new business or creating a family foundation.""This shift in what retirement looks like reflects the pursuit of purpose and impact that many business owners value beyond just the drive to create wealth,"" said Eric Czepyha, Northern Trust’s Director of Business Services. ""To prepare for this second phase, business owners should consider implementing a formulaic approach to evaluating new private investment opportunities, exploring various sources of capital for funding their ‘next big thing’ and making sure that their heirs are prepared to inherit the unique and complex assets they invest in.""Inheritance: Who Gets What, and Why?Although over 90% of survey respondents indicated that they have some sort of estate plan in place, one in three have not updated their estate plans over the past year, and 11% have not done so for at least the past three years. The top three drivers that led respondents to create their estate plans were achieving a certain level of wealth (52%), encouragement from their advisors (46%), and having a child (33%).Story continuesWhile major life events tend to be the main catalysts for motivating business owners to make estate planning a priority, estate plans should be reviewed at least every few years absent a change in circumstances. This is particularly true for entrepreneurs, whose business and wealth may change rapidly in size and complexity. ""These findings underscore the need for entrepreneurs to shift away from a ‘set it and forget it’ mentality and instead take a more proactive approach to their wealth plan,"" Czepyha said.The Emotional Rollercoaster of Selling a BusinessFor most business owners, selling their business is a life-changing event that has profound, multi-generational financial implications and may also impact the business owner’s family dynamics and even their overall outlook on life. Although survey respondents who have sold one or more businesses reported experiencing a range of positive and negative emotions after the sale, 37% reported that their lives had become better since the sale, and 47% reported that their lives had become much better.Nonetheless, many respondents reported having certain regrets post-sale. For instance, more than half (59%) felt concerned about how the buyer was treating their former employees, 43% felt they had walked away before the full potential of their business had been realized, and 36% admitted they were not entirely on board with the buyer’s vision for the company.""Between the insights from this research and my own observations from working with entrepreneurial clients, it is clear that selling a business is more than just a financial transaction—it’s almost always personal, too,"" said Czepyha. ""That is why pre-transaction planning is so critical–from creating a ‘post-exit checklist’ to negotiating the deal with a view toward your long-term financial plans. Discipline before the sale will help minimize regrets thereafter.""Finding Purpose Post-SaleBusiness owners tend to keep busy after the sale of their business. Survey respondents spend an average of a third of their time (29%) on starting a new business, 14% on consulting and sitting on boards, and 13% on pursuing philanthropic endeavors.""Without the ‘centerpiece’ of a business to run and an office to visit, the task of reorganizing life after the sale and pursuing your various interests can often feel disjointed and even overwhelming,"" said Czepyha. ""It’s important to get ahead of this transition by employing strategies such as establishing a post-exit infrastructure for how you will deploy and manage your newfound liquidity, and reimagining how you will make an impact on the world beyond your business.""The Northern Trust Institute is a research center dedicated to advising affluent families.

""The game has changed. It used to be just subscribers at all cost...but now [investors] need these services to be profitable.""Bart Spiegel, partner of global entertainment &amp; media deals at PwC, added: ""We're entering a chapter two of the streaming wars.""""Only time will tell, but I think everything's on the table to try to improve profitability and make the platforms more creative to their overall business,"" he continued.Deal volumes and values in the media and telecommunications sector slowed in 2022 compared to last year's record, according to PwC's biannual U.S. Deals Outlook.Over the past 12 months ending in November, there have been 3,772 deals — a 26% year-over-year decrease — with announced deal value totaling $624 billion, an 18% dip versus 2021.This content is not available due to your privacy preferences.Update your settings here to see it.The firm attributed the slowdown to higher interest rates and inflation, coupled with growing geopolitical tensions and regulatory oversight.The FTC's recent antitrust lawsuit against Microsoft (MSFT) and its $69 billion acquisition of “Call of Duty” publisher Activision Blizzard (ATVI) and Paramount's (PARA) blocked sale of Simon and Schuster serve as the latest examples of this more combative regulatory environment.The Microsoft-Activision deal, along with Elon Musk's $44 billion Twitter takeover, were the two largest deals announced in the media and telecom space this year.The report included all deals announced in 2022 — regardless of whether or not they closed. Amazon's $8.5 billion acquisition of MGM and WarnerMedia's $43 billion merger with Discovery did not count toward this year's total as they were announced prior to 2022.Story continues'Consolidation will happen'Paramount CEO Bob Bakish doubled down on consolidation, more M&amp;A in mediaAmid this shifting landscape, media executives have floated merger and consolidation possibilities.Paramount CEO Bob Bakish recently revealing during a UBS media conference earlier this month: ""Consolidation has been the rule in business for a long time, certainly been the rule in media. So, it’s hard for me to bet on anything other than consolidation will happen in the future.""Jason Kilar, former CEO of WarnerMedia and the founding CEO of Hulu, wrote in a Wall Street Journal op-ed published earlier this month he expects, ""two or three major mergers and/or acquisitions involving entertainment companies in the coming 24 months"" as cash flow challenges deepen.Streaming losses have mounted in recent years as the cost of content continues to skyrocket.Disney's (DIS) direct-to-consumer division shed a whopping $4 billion-plus in its fiscal 2022, which ended on October 1, while Paramount guided streaming losses would total about $1.8 billion this year — higher than Wall Street expectations.Warner Bros. Discovery (WBD), which has slashed its market cap in half amid its messy restructuring efforts, reported free cash flow of negative $192 million in the third quarter, compared to $705 million in the year prior. The company now plans to take on $3.5 billion in content impairment and development write-offs by 2024.As WBD struggles for direction, many industry insiders believe the embattled company will sell again — making it a possible acquisition target in 2023 and beyond.Another asset for sale will be Lionsgate's film and TV studio, which the entertainment giant plans to spin off into a separate company, while AMC Networks (AMCX) continues to undergo a restructuring that could result in a sale.Needham's Laura Martin wrote in a recent client note Paramount could be attractive to unload, while smaller players like WWE (WWE), Curiosity Stream (CURIW), and Chicken Soup for the Soul (CSSE) will likely sell due to their size.Disney CEO Bob Iger will also face a slew of decisions — including what to do with notable assets like Hulu (sell it to Comcast?) and ESPN (spin it off?).Disney's Chief Executive Officer Bob Iger speaks during the Bloomberg Global Business Forum in New York City, New York, U.S., September 25, 2019. REUTERS/Shannon Stapleton""There's definitely going to be assets for sale in the market,"" Mary Ann Halford, partner at Altman Solon, said. ""The bigger question is: What do we see coming out of the very large media companies? And we've also seen that the tech giants have been rather slow to scoop up these assets.""As for tech behemoth Amazon (AMZN), Amazon CEO Andy Jassy said in an interview at The New York Times' Dealbook Summit last month, ""I do think over time we have opportunities to make our Prime Video business a standalone business with very attractive economics.""""Customers would like to go to a place and find everything they want, they don’t want to go to 5 or 6 different places,"" Jassy said.What will drive M&amp;A?PwC noted demand for live sports, including sports-adjacent industries like sports gambling, will likely drive future M&amp;A activity.""There is so much money in sports, and getting live sports onto the streaming platforms is an area that is still not completely tapped,"" Qvest's Christian said. ""The question there is: Can they put a pencil to it? Because the price is so high for the content. Are they now going to be able to get the subscribers necessary to be profitable in that business?""Spiegel agreed that rising content costs will likely pressure future dealmaking, although more disciplined content spend could force platforms to partner up in order to offset production risks.Amazon Thursday Night Football analysts prepare for a pregame live shot before the football game between the Philadelphia Eagles and Houston Texans at NRG Stadium on November 3, 2022 in Houston, TX.

""More traditional video game companies have that IP [and] also have the engines and technologies that help in the content creation process.""Overall, though, the biggest M&amp;A opportunity will be content — especially as consumers become more choosy with their subscription plans.""Content and IP will always be attractive, because, not only is there a direct ability to monetize that existing content, IP, or library, but also the tangential opportunities to monetize through sequels or other types of storylines,"" Spiegel said.""You can look at so many different things, but you need to have quality content,"" Christian added. ""Content is always going to be king.""'It's a tough world for financing'As recession concerns weigh on investor sentiment heading into the new year, PwC predicated a negative impact on valuations.""It's a tough world for financing so [private equity] is more sitting on the sidelines right now,"" Spiegel said.""There's likely going to be a gap between what sellers expect for the valuation of their properties, versus what buyers are willing to pay, because you have a diminished buyer pool and the access to financing is much more expensive,"" he said.Still, ""I do expect private equity will return — they're sitting on a significant amount of dry powder, but we just have to wait for the markets to come back in their favor.""Altman Solon's Halford added higher interest rates will fuel macro challenges after the Federal Reserve delivered investors its seventh and final interest rate increase of 2022.""When people are looking to buy out something with equity and debt, the interest rate environment is definitely a headwind,"" Halford said.However, Halford said there will still be assets for sale next year, even with these challenges: ""Wall Street is going to be on [these companies'] tails.""This content is not available due to your privacy preferences.Update your settings here to see it.Alexandra is a Senior Entertainment and Media Reporter at Yahoo Finance.

Some of the most well-known companies had a tough 2022, with Disney DIS and Netflix NFLX being two that stuck out.Let’s see what’s going on with the entertainment titans as we move closer to the new year.Recent Developments Long-term Disney CEO Bob Iger returned to the helms in November after briefly retiring from the company. Before retirement, Iger more recently served as Executive Chairman but came back to his more active CEO role at the request of the board of directors.Iger returned after fears that the company and stock would continue falling in his absence. Even amid the surprising but very welcome return for Wall Street, Disney stock is back near its 52-week lows seen in November.Meanwhile, Netflix has seen some recent volatility as well with the launch of its much-anticipated paid ad service not going as well as planned. News of Netflix missing 20% of its ad targets caused the stock to sell off last week after advertisers reportedly asked that the company return some of the money already paid for advertising slots.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchPerformance &amp; Valuation Year to date, Disney’s stock is down -44% Vs. Netflix’s -52%. DIS and NFLX stock has underperformed the S&amp;P 500’s -19% and the Media Conglomerate Markets -37%. Over the last decade, NFLX is still up an astonishing +2,105% to crush DIS’s +71% and the benchmark. Both stocks have outperformed their Zacks Subindustry’s +9%, but Disney lagged the broader market.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchTrading around $85 per share and roughly 46% from its highs, Disney has a forward P/E of 22.1X. In comparison, Netflix is 53% off its high at around $288 a share and trades at 28.2X forward earnings.Disney trades 83% below its decade high of 134.43X and slightly above its median of 19.7X. When comparing this period, Netflix looks much more attractive trading well below its decade high of 2,585X and also at a 74% discount to its median of 110.1X.Story continuesGrowthDisney earnings are now expected to jump 15% in its current fiscal year 2023 and climb another 31% in FY24 at $5.34 per share. However, earnings estimate revisions have largely gone down over the last 90 days attributed to operating losses among its streaming segments Disney+ and ESPN+.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchSales are forecasted to rise 10% in FY23 and another 6% in FY24 to $96.61 billion. Fiscal 2024 would be a 25% increase from pre-pandemic levels with 2019 sales at $69.57 billion.Look at Netflix, earnings are projected to drop -8% in 2022 and rise 3% in fiscal 2023 at $10.67 per share. Earnings estimates are slightly up for FY22 but have trended down for FY23.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchOn the top line, Netflix’s sales are expected to be up 6% this year and jump another 7% in FY23 to $33.92 billion. FY23 would represent 68% growth from pre-pandemic levels with 2019 sales at $20.15 billion.Bottom Line &amp; Takeaway Netflix’s historical performance and valuation could be an indication that the stock is more poised for a 2023 rebound than Disney. Despite Disney’s expected bottom line growth in its FY23 and FY24, earnings estimate revisions have continued to largely trend down for both years landing the stock a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) at the moment.On the other hand, earnings estimate revisions have started to go up in Netflix’s FY22 with the stock currently landing a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). Netflix also appears to be the better long-term choice at the moment for 2023 and beyond as indicated in its top-line growth despite short-term headwinds with its paid ad business.

According to the research firm Ampere Analysis, TV networks and streaming companies are buying far fewer adult scripted series, down 24% for the second half of the year.Yahoo Finance reporter Allie Canal is here with what's next for the industry as a whole. Allie, where are we headed?ALEXANDRA CANAL: Yeah, where we're heading, it's going to be interesting to see what happens in 2023 because 2022 was a much slower year for media M&amp;A. That's due to a variety of reasons, one being the fact that the Fed hiked interest rates seven times so far this year. That's automatically going to pressure dealmaking.We did see the closing of some pretty big deals like Warner Brothers Discovery, Amazon's acquisition of MGM. But moving ahead into 2023, there is this expectation that, although there will be less, there is certainly going to be a lot of activity.I spoke with a few experts. There's also a new report out from PwC, and they really elaborated on what's going to drive media M&amp;A, one being sports rights and sports-adjacent industries like sports gambling. The issue there, though, is that sports rights are very competitively priced, and a lot of these media giants, they are pulling back spending. Wall Street wants to make sure that you're profitable. They're not spending nearly as much as they did in years past. So that's going to be an interesting story to watch in 2023.Some other things, other types of media M&amp;A could include video games. That proven intellectual property going a long way there.Also repurposed theaters. Could a streaming giant potentially buy a theater chain? That's something that could be possible.And we've heard from these prominent media executives-- Paramount CEO Bob Bakish, Jason Kilar, former head of WarnerMedia-- they all agree that consolidation is happening. The question is the timeline, and Kilar hinted that that timeline is pretty quick. He said in two years, we're really going to have three major players.Story continuesSo it's something that we're going to have to watch. We've heard rumblings that potentially Warner Brothers Discovery could sell itself again or perhaps sell more parts of itself. We also have some of those smaller players like WWE, Chicken Soup for the Soul. Maybe some of the bigger players will gobble them up. And then with Disney, ESPN. Do you spin it off? Do you sell Hulu to Comcast?So I do think Wall Street is going to be on these companies' tails. You want to be profitable. M&amp;A one of the more practical ways to get there, and a lot of question marks for a lot of these media companies.DAVE BRIGGS: Everybody kind of standing around looking for a dance partner in that awkward -ALEXANDRA CANAL: Exactly.DAVE BRIGGS: --moment in time. Allie Canal, good stuff. Thank you.]"

(NASDAQ:AMGN) insiders sold a substantial stake in the company which may have sparked shareholders' attention. Knowing whether insiders are buying is usually more helpful when evaluating insider transactions, as insider selling can have various explanations. However, shareholders should take a deeper look if several insiders are selling stock over a specific time period.While insider transactions are not the most important thing when it comes to long-term investing, logic dictates you should pay some attention to whether insiders are buying or selling shares. Check out our latest analysis for Amgen The Last 12 Months Of Insider Transactions At AmgenIn the last twelve months, the biggest single sale by an insider was when the Executive VP, Jonathan Graham, sold US$3.3m worth of shares at a price of US$242 per share. That means that even when the share price was below the current price of US$266, an insider wanted to cash in some shares. When an insider sells below the current price, it suggests that they considered that lower price to be fair. That makes us wonder what they think of the (higher) recent valuation. However, while insider selling is sometimes discouraging, it's only a weak signal. We note that the biggest single sale was only 40% of Jonathan Graham's holding.Amgen insiders didn't buy any shares over the last year. The chart below shows insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last year. If you click on the chart, you can see all the individual transactions, including the share price, individual, and the date!insider-trading-volumeIf you like to buy stocks that insiders are buying, rather than selling, then you might just love this free list of companies. (Hint: insiders have been buying them).Insiders At Amgen Have Sold Stock RecentlyThe last quarter saw substantial insider selling of Amgen shares. In total, insiders dumped US$273k worth of shares in that time, and we didn't record any purchases whatsoever. Overall this makes us a bit cautious, but it's not the be all and end all.Story continuesDoes Amgen Boast High Insider Ownership?I like to look at how many shares insiders own in a company, to help inform my view of how aligned they are with insiders. I reckon it's a good sign if insiders own a significant number of shares in the company. It's great to see that Amgen insiders own 0.2% of the company, worth about US$226m. I like to see this level of insider ownership, because it increases the chances that management are thinking about the best interests of shareholders.What Might The Insider Transactions At Amgen Tell Us?Insiders sold Amgen shares recently, but they didn't buy any. And even if we look at the last year, we didn't see any purchases. On the plus side, Amgen makes money, and is growing profits. It is good to see high insider ownership, but the insider selling leaves us cautious. In addition to knowing about insider transactions going on, it's beneficial to identify the risks facing Amgen.

The yellow metal is trading slightly lower for 2022, and is also down substantially from peaks hit during the initial days of the Russia-Ukraine conflict.Spot gold fell 0.1% to $1,785.46 an ounce, while gold futures fell 0.2% to $1,794.60 an ounce by 19:25 ET (00:25 GMT).The latest selling pressure on gold comes from a series of hawkish central bank comments last week, which heralded a continued rise in interest rates in the coming year. The trend spells more pressure on gold and other metals, as rising rates battered the metals market by driving up the opportunity cost of holding non-yielding assets.Investors are now also concerned over a potential recession in 2023, driven chiefly by high inflation and rising interest rates.Focus on slowing economic growth is also expected to define the last two trading weeks of 2022 amid a dearth of other cues. Trading volumes are also expected to be diminished by a series of market holidays.Other precious metals also retreated on Tuesday.Among industrial metals, copper prices were steadier than their peers amid continued bets that an economic recovery in China will fuel copper demand.Copper futures rose 0.1% to $3.7637 a pound.But the red metal’s outlook remains clouded by uncertainty over a global recession, with weakening economic activity across the globe likely to offset a demand recovery in major importer China.Story continuesStill, tightening copper supply, due to political unrest in top producers Chile and Peru, is likely to help support prices in the coming months.Related ArticlesGold prices slip further below $1,800 as rate hike fears weighOil climbs, but uncertainty on China COVID surge caps gainsRainforest-rich nations ensure COP15 deal on nature sticks]"

The sol rose 0.3% after Peruvian President Dina Boluarte, who is leading a transitional government following the ouster of her predecessor, said she will replace the prime minister as part of a reshuffling of her Cabinet. ""The move is Boluarte's attempt to seek support in order to approve early elections amid ongoing protests,"" Citi strategists wrote in a client note. ""She declared the reshuffling aims to build a 'political team' to facilitate dialogue in the country, and said the new elections cannot be held without new political reforms."" Currencies of oil exporters Mexico and Colombia added 0.4% and 0.2% respectively as crude prices rose on hopes of a recovery in demand. Mexico's economy likely contracted by 0.1% in November compared with the previous month, a preliminary estimate from national statistics agency INEGI showed. The dollar retreated from a rally supported by hawkish tones from major central banks last week. Brazil's real reversed losses and climbed 0.3% as President-elect Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva scored two key victories after the Supreme Court granted an injunction allowing him to increase social investment, while also outlawing an opaque congressional spending program. Investors are still awaiting a decision by Brazil's lower house to increase the spending cap by 145 billion reais ($27.8 billion) for each year to cover payments of 600 reais a month under the Bolsa Familia welfare program. It was approved by the Senate in early December. ""There is a really good story developing in Brazil,"" said Edmund Shing, chief investment officer at BNP Paribas Wealth Management. ""You have a very strong commodity backdrop, with both mining and oil; secondly, you have a government that has been successful before, the market may see that the political climate will be more stable than it was under Bolsonaro; and thirdly, interest rates are already incredibly high in Brazil."" Still, gains in most Latin American currencies were limited after China officially reported its first coronavirus-related deaths since unwinding some of its strictest pandemic control measures earlier this month. Chile's peso dipped 0.4% as concerns about China's efforts to exit from its zero-COVID strategies outweighed a rise in prices of copper, the South American country's main export. Latin American economies, which rely heavily on China as a trading partner, have been bogged down by worries that Beijing's rapid easing of COVID-19 control measures could lead to more infections and further disruptions to demand. Still, the MSCI's index for Latam stocks has fared relatively better compared to others for the year, falling about 2.6% compared to a much steeper 22.3% slide in the broader emerging markets equities index.

The Naval Sea Systems Command, Washington, DC. awarded the deal.Details of the DealValued at $302.2 million, the contract includes manufacture, production, spares, production support material and engineering support for components related to the MK 48 heavyweight torpedo. The contract will serve the U.S. Navy and the Royal Australian Navy.The work related to this deal will be carried out at multiple locations across the United States, with the majority in Liverpool, NY. The work is scheduled to be completed by October 2026.What’s Favoring Lockheed Martin?The MK 48 Mod 7 CBASS torpedo is the U.S. Navy’s most capable and potent anti-surface and anti-submarine weapon in use aboard U.S. Navy and allied submarines. Moreover, it has been designed to be exceedingly lethal and effective against threats operating in deep and shallow waters.Additionally, broadband sonar enhancement makes the torpedo more effective against emerging submarine classes in the harshest acoustic environments. The CBASS torpedo also has the ability of multiband operation.Due to the advanced features provided by the weapon, the torpedo has been enjoying significant demand, resulting in multiple contracts wins for Lockheed Martin. The latest contract is a bright example of this.Going forward, LMT expects production orders for the torpedo to be more than 250 over the next five years for the U.S. Navy. Such a strong demand expectation is likely to benefit the company with a steady inflow of orders, like the latest one, thereby bolstering its top line in the days ahead.Growth ProspectsNations are increasing defense spending to strengthen their defense structure.

122,9cb74535-462e-3292-aafe-fbefd342fecb,NRG,2022-12-20,5 Stocks With Impressive EV-to-EBITDA Ratios to Scoop Up,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/5-stocks-impressive-ev-ebitda-112511492.html,1671535511,STORY,"['NRG', 'GLP-PB', 'CAAS', 'GPI']","[The price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio is broadly considered as the yardstick for evaluating the fair market value of a stock. It is preferred by many investors while handpicking stocks trading at attractive prices. However, even this universally used valuation multiple is not without its limitations.While P/E enjoys huge popularity among value investors, a less-used and more-complicated metric called EV-to-EBITDA is sometimes viewed as a better alternative. EV-to-EBITDA gives the true picture of a company’s valuation and earnings potential. It has a more comprehensive approach to valuation.  Global Partners LP GLP, China Automotive Systems, Inc. CAAS, Sterling Infrastructure, Inc. STRL, Group 1 Automotive, Inc. GPI and NRG Energy, Inc. NRG are some stocks with attractive EV-to-EBITDA ratios.EV-to-EBITDA is a Better Option, Here’s WhyEV-to-EBITDA is essentially the enterprise value (EV) of a stock divided by its earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA). EV is the sum of a company’s market capitalization, its debt and preferred stock minus cash and cash equivalents.EBITDA, the other element of the multiple, gives a better idea of a company’s profitability as it removes the impact of non-cash expenses like depreciation and amortization that reduce net earnings. It is also often used as a proxy for cash flows.Just like P/E, the lower the EV-to-EBITDA ratio, the more attractive it is. A low EV-to-EBITDA ratio could signal that a stock is potentially undervalued.  Unlike the P/E ratio, EV-to-EBITDA takes debt on a company’s balance sheet into account. For this reason, it is typically used to value potential acquisition targets. The ratio shows the amount of debt that the acquirer has to bear. Stocks flaunting a low EV-to-EBITDA multiple could be seen as attractive takeover candidates.Moreover, P/E can’t be used to value a loss-making firm. A firm’s earnings are also subject to accounting estimates and management manipulation. In contrast, EV-to-EBITDA is harder to manipulate and can be used to value companies that have negative net earnings but are positive on the EBITDA front.EV-to-EBITDA is also a useful tool in measuring the value of firms that are highly leveraged and have a high degree of depreciation. Moreover, it can be used to compare companies with different levels of debt.However, EV-to-EBITDA is not devoid of shortcomings and alone cannot conclusively determine a stock’s inherent potential and future performance. The multiple varies across industries and is usually not appropriate while comparing stocks in different industries, given their diverse capital expenditure requirements.Therefore, instead of just relying on EV-to-EBITDA, you can club it with the other major ratios such as price-to-book (P/B), P/E and price-to-sales (P/S) to achieve the desired results.Story continuesScreening CriteriaHere are the parameters to screen for value stocks:EV-to-EBITDA 12 Months-Most Recent less than X-Industry Median: A lower EV-to-EBITDA ratio represents a cheaper valuation.P/E using (F1) less than X-Industry Median: This metric screens stocks that are trading at a discount to their peers.P/B less than X-Industry Median: A lower P/B compared with the industry average implies that the stock is undervalued.P/S less than X-Industry Median: The lower the P/S ratio, the more attractive the stock is, as investors will have to pay a smaller price for the same amount of sales generated by the company.Estimated One-Year EPS Growth F(1)/F(0) greater than or equal to X-Industry Median: This parameter will help in screening stocks that have growth rates higher than the industry median.

The more challenging matter is figuring out how to make the goals realistic to avoid over-promising and under-delivering.If your business is considering a sustainability plan, you've likely heard about ""net-zero"" carbon emissions. The Biden administration hopes to achieve a net-zero U.S. economy by 2050, and many businesses are establishing their own net-zero carbon commitments, mostly in keeping with the Science Based Target initiative (SBTi).Net-zero emissions might be the right goal for your business, but true zero means eliminating what are known as Scope 1, Scope 2, and Scope 3 emissions. Scope 1 emissions are those that come directly from your operations. An industrial manufacturer may have significant Scope 1 emissions while a chain of retail stores may have almost none.Scope 2 emissions are those created by the production of electricity, heating and cooling that is purchased by a company, while Scope 3 are indirect emissions that occur along a company's value chain, either upstream or downstream of it. Essentially every business starting a sustainability journey needs to cut these types of emissions.The nature of your operation should inform the scale and timing of your sustainable energy goals. An industrial manufacturer might have to wait for new technology before it can cut its Scope 1 emissions, while a chain of retail stores may simply need to procure renewable electricity to eliminate its Scope 1 and 2 emissions.Calculation comes firstIt's impossible to set realistic sustainable energy goals without a detailed understanding of how your operations use energy. Yet, businesses often do not have that knowledge at their disposal.We strongly suggest starting with an audit across locations and equipment which will allow you to calculate your energy use at a granular level. And don't stop there. Set up a system for continued measurement so that this process of addressing carbon mitigation efforts is replicable from one reporting period to the next. This will give you the information needed to create a plan to reduce emissions and track progress.Story continuesGranted, this isn't always an easy task to do on your own. Many businesses benefit from partnering with a trusted energy advisor who can aggregate their energy use and calculate the emissions it creates and then set up a system for future tracking.Now or laterNext, determine timeframes to reach milestones and goals that are in keeping with the best practices for collective action to mitigate emissions. This is perhaps the most important step to create a realistic sustainability plan.It might seem harmless - or even motivating - to set aggressive sustainable energy goals, but if they are unrealistic and you fall short, you risk losing the trust of customers, employees, and investors. However, setting goals that are not ambitious enough can also result in reputational risk.Getting the timing right starts with assessing what actions your business can take in the short term to reduce energy-related emissions and what actions are reasonable to pursue later.In the near term, many businesses have opportunities to reduce energy use through energy efficiency and weatherization projects. Flexible demand is another near-term opportunity, allowing companies to tap the full potential of smart appliances to control when and where they use energy to reduce energy demand or shift it, such as to peak daylight hours to maximize the use of solar power.Cost-saving opportunities from load shifting and Demand Response programs are available in certain regions and states. Many companies look to renewable energy credits (RECs) or carbon offsets as a simple way to reduce reportable emissions from operations, quickly and affordably. These measures can be part of an effective start to a sustainable energy plan.In the longer term, businesses should consider new technologies on the horizon and how the cost of existing technologies is expected to change.For example, a company with a fleet of delivery vehicles might decide fleet electrification is a desirable path to lower emissions. Should they start buying that electric fleet today or wait five years? To make the best decision, it's important to understand how the market for electric vehicles will change, and how that fits with other actions your business could prioritize first.""Do your own research"" is a popular phrase these days, and any smart business does just that. But sometimes a business needs a trusted partner to guide the research process.Find a partner with sustainability planning knowledge and experienceAs a large energy company with a track record of success, NRG has the experience and expertise to evaluate energy opportunities for a wide range of businesses. And as an early leader in sustainable energy, we bring deep insights about emerging technologies and market developments that will help you see into the uncertain future with more clarity.Setting sustainable energy goals as part of a sustainability plan is complex.

126,c1ad247c-483d-33ff-919c-63b141e69357,BK,2022-12-20,7 Stocking Stuffer Stocks That Warren Buffett Loves,InvestorPlace,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/7-stocking-stuffer-stocks-warren-131837263.html,1671196717,STORY,"['BRK-A', 'CVX', 'BRK-B', 'BK', 'BAC', 'AAPL', 'HPQ', 'DEO']","[As we near the holiday season, investors looking for stocking stuffer stocks for their loved ones have come to the right place. In compiling such a list, the best place to start would be with the portfolio of one of the greatest investors of all time.Indeed, most investors sit up and pay attention whenever Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRK-B) CEO Warren Buffett buys or sells a stock. This company’s 13-F filings are among the most-watched in the market for a good reason. Buffett is among the best leading indicators to watch for long-term investors looking at where the smart money is investing in this market.Accordingly, it’s not surprising to note that Berkshire has been loading up on energy stocks over the past year, with continued purchases of both Occidental Petroleum (NYSE:OXY) and Chevron (NYSE:CVX). Sticking to industries he knows, Buffett has carved out a compelling portfolio of quality companies trading at reasonable prices.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsAdditionally, Buffett’s tech exposure (which I’ll get to in a minute) has also outperformed. His picks across various sectors within his realm of expertise are all holdings I have on my watch list right now.With that said, let’s dive into seven stocks to put in one’s holiday stockings as we head into a new year.AAPLApple$143.25BACBank of America$32.69BKBank of New York Mellon$45.04CVXChevron$172.99CCitigroup$46.54DEODiageo$188.49HPQHP Inc.$28.46Apple (AAPL)Apple (AAPL) logo brand and text sign on entrance facade store American multinational boutique corporation dealership shopSource: sylv1rob1 / Shutterstock.comOne of the best-performing stocks over the past decade, Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) has become one of Warren Buffett’s most successful investments. The Oracle of Omaha began building a massive stake in the world’s largest company in early 2016. Since then, this company has continued to surge to new highs.Apple’s ability to maintain high gross profit margins via selling high-valued products to a loyal consumer base can’t be understated. Apple remains among the most valuable brands in the world due mainly to its closed-loop ecosystem. Accordingly, many investors continue to hold Apple as a very long-term investment, even at these levels (Buffett included).Story continuesNow down more than 20% from its all-time high, Apple is (finally) trading at a discount for value investors. While Buffett has done some trimming in the past, this holding is by and far the largest in his portfolio. As of writing, Berkshire Hathaway currently holds more than 915 million shares of AAPL stock, valued at more than $131 billion. That’s good for a 39.4% weighting in his portfolio.Bank of America (BAC)Bank of America (BAC) logo on top of a retail office building.Source: 4kclips / Shutterstock.comOne of the world’s largest banks, Bank of America (NYSE:BAC), is in the second-largest position in Warren Buffett’s portfolio. Berkshire’s stake, worth more than $33 billion, makes up around 10% of the company’s holdings. Thus, this is a logical stocking stuffer idea for those interested in gaining exposure to the banking sector.Bank of America’s diversified business model focuses on the individual/retail banking market, institutional investors, corporations of all sizes, and government lines of business. The mega-cap multinational lender is a systemically important bank, providing investors with a floor in worst-case scenarios (remember the whole “too big to fail” discussion during the last financial crisis?). This obviously bodes well for investors concerned about what could be a painful recession on the horizon.On a monthly basis alone, BAC stock is down roughly 10%, giving investors looking for exposure a nice entry point here. As we head into the holiday season, Bank of America is one gift worth considering.Bank of New York Mellon (BK)Sign of BNY Mellon Wealth Management. The Bank of New York Mellon Corporation (BK) is an American banking and financial services holding company.Sticking with the financial space for a minute, Bank of New York Mellon (NYSE:BK) makes this list of top stocking stuffer stocks to buy for a good reason.The Bank of New York Mellon offers financial services in both the U.S. market and globally. Thus, unlike its name suggests, the Bank of New York Mellon is much more than a small regional bank.This lender’s focus on the securities, wealth management and investment markets is why Buffett is so keen on this bank. These areas of the lending world tend to be less cyclical than retail or corporate banking, for example. Generally speaking, the rich find a way to keep their capital, even during difficult times. Thus, this is a more recession-resistant name worth considering for defensive investors.Buffett’s stake of 62.5 million shares is worth around $2.8 billion.Chevron (CVX)a Chevron gas stationSource: Trong Nguyen / Shutterstock.comThe only energy stock to make this list of top stocking stuffer stocks is Chevron, and that’s not taking anything away from the aforementioned Occidental Petroleum. Aside from being a company I think is an incredible long-term investment, Chevron has also found its way into Warren Buffett’s portfolio, no small feat.Indeed, Warren Buffett received plenty of flack for his investment in Chevron and other energy names over the past couple of years. Of course, Berkshire is already a big player in this space via its energy division, and the company is doing plenty of great things in building out high-power transmission lines, which will accelerate the electrification movement. Thus, if anything, Mr. Buffett puts his money where his mouth is, and the profits will be.That said, his bet on Chevron appears to be both a smart medium-term bet, as well as a market hedge. If inflation continues to soar, Chevron’s gains can soften the blow from his other positions. Thus, this is a stock worth considering.With just under 170 million shares, Buffett’s stake in Chevron is worth $29.3 billion.Citigroup (C)A Citibank (C) sign hangs on a Citibank office in Hong Kong.Source: TungCheung / Shutterstock.comThere’s a trend building with this list of stocking stuffer stocks. Indeed, investors who know Warren Buffett know his affinity toward financial companies. Citigroup (NYSE:C) is yet another holding in this category within Berkshire Hathaway’s portfolio worth considering.However, the lender’s performance over the past year has not been great. So, why has this stock made this list?Well, perhaps the most globally-centric bank on this list, Citigroup, is an option for investors looking for ex-U.S. exposure to this sector. Given the relative outperformance of the U.S. market during this previous bull run, investors may start to focus in on international exposure from here. With most investors focused on the U.S. market, Citigroup’s valuation may be overlooked. Thus, this is among Buffett’s more sleepy holdings I like.Currently, Berkshire holds a little more than 55 million shares of C stock, worth $2.5 billion.Diageo (DEO)a line up of black label whiskey to represent DEO stockSource: IgorGolovniov / Shutterstock.comAmong the smallest positions in Warren Buffett’s portfolio, Diageo (NYSE:DEO) is a company that I’ve noted has been a Buffett holding in the past. That said, with only 227,750 shares of DEO stock, Berkshire’s position in this liquor maker sits at “only” $43 million. Thus, given the size of Berkshire Hathaway’s overall portfolio, this amounts to far less than 0.1% of the company’s overall holdings.So, why is this stock worth putting on investors’ radars this holiday season? Well, alcohol consumption tends to remain relatively inelastic relative to economic conditions. In good times or bad, people will drink. Many will argue that when times are tough, the desire for a glass of Johnny Walker whiskey will increase, not decrease.The company’s various brands, which include Johnny Walker and others, provide Diageo with a moat in this highly-competitive space. The company believes that it can achieve an organic compound annual growth rate between 6% and 9% for the next three fiscal years. That’s certainly not a dire outlook, considering how quickly many other companies drop guidance.HP Inc. (HPQ)Source: Tomasz Wozniak / Shutterstock.comAn old-school technology company to make this list, HP Inc. (NYSE:HPQ), rounds out this list of stocking stuffer stocks to buy. This stock is last on the list because it’s one that I’m not personally interested in. However, I see the thesis as to why some long-term investors may want to consider this company at these levels.Like most tech or tech-adjacent stocks, HP’s stock price has been hit very hard this year. Down more than 25% on a year-to-date basis alone, HPQ stock is one that’s not necessarily a momentum stock investor may want to hold in this environment. Should the economy slow, the PC and hardware market may continue to decline.That said, this is a company that’s also trading at less than 10 times earnings, with intriguing exposure to the IT, hybrid cloud, and software solutions markets.Buffett’s holdings of HPQ account for roughly 1% of his portfolio, worth around $3.4 billion.On the date of publication, Chris MacDonald has a position in AAPL. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.Chris MacDonald’s love for investing led him to pursue an MBA in Finance and take on a number of management roles in corporate finance and venture capital over the past 15 years.

However, energy has reentered the market at a time when the sector's shares are up substantially for the year,"" said Howard Silverblatt, Senior Index Analyst at S&amp;P Dow Jones Indices. ""The math of lower stock prices has resulted in more shares repurchased with 21.2% of the companies in the S&amp;P 500 increasing their earnings-per-share by at least 4% thanks to their newly lowered share counts. The impact is expected to increase in Q4 2022 as companies appear to have accelerated their buybacks from Q1 2023 to Q4 2022 to avoid the new buyback tax.""1% Buyback Excise Tax for 2023:On a proforma basis, the new 1% excise tax on net buybacks would have reduced Q3 2022 operating earnings by 0.46%, down from the proforma 0.48% for Q3 2021, with as reported GAAP earnings being reduced by 0.52%, up from the proforma 0.50% for Q3 2021. For the proforma 12-months period ending in September 2022, the tax would have cost S&amp;P 500 companies $9.0 billion, and would have reduced operating earnings by 0.53% and as reported GAAP earnings by 0.57%.Silverblatt added: ""While going from zero to anything is the biggest increase, the 1% tax is an additional cost, but it is still not significant enough to impact overall buybacks at this point. However, some buybacks planned for 2023 appear to have been moved into Q4 2022. The buyback tax had bipartisan support, so there is a good possibility that the 1% level is only the opening rate, which if increased enough could shift some of the shareholder returns to dividends.""Q3 2022 GICS® Sector Analysis:Information Technology continued to lead in buybacks, as its percentage of buybacks and aggregate expenditures decreased. In Q3 2022, IT's share decreased to 28.8% of all S&amp;P 500 buybacks compared to Q2 2022's 32.8% and Q3 2021's 28.2%, as expenditures decreased (15.5%) to $60.8 billion from the prior quarter's $72.0 billion and were 8.0% lower than the Q3 2021 expenditure of $66.1 billion. For the 12-months ending September 2022, the sector spent $279.2 billion, representing 28.4% of all S&amp;P buybacks, compared to the 2021 12-month $241.3 billion expenditure, which represented 32.5% of all buybacks. For the 10-years, the sector spent $1.857 trillion, representing 29.0% of the expenditures.Financials increased their buybacks after last quarter's significant pull back, as their Q3 2022 expenditures increased 8.5% to $23.0 billion, representing 10.9% of the buybacks, from the Q2 2022 $21.2 billion, which represented 9.7% of all buybacks, but was 62.8% less than their Q3 2021 expenditure of $61.9 billion.Energy continued to increase their buybacks, as they increased their expenditures by 64.5% for the quarter, to $22.0 billion (on a sector basis, second only to its Q4 2007 $25.3 billion expenditure), from the prior quarter's $13.4 billion and were up 640% from the Q3 2021 $3.0 billion. For the 12-months, buybacks were $51.6 billion compared to the prior period's $5.4 billion, an 853% increase.Health Care buybacks increased 17.2% (after decreasing 58.2% last quarter), spending $20.2 billion in Q3 2022, representing 9.6% of all buybacks, up from the Q2 2022 $17.2 billion, which accounted for 7.8% of the buybacks, and were 24.6% higher than the Q3 2021 expenditure of $16.2 billion.Issues:The five issues with the highest total buybacks for Q3 2022 are:Apple (AAPL): continued to be the poster child for buybacks as it once again spent the most of any issue, with its Q3 2022 expenditure ranking as the third highest in S&amp;P 500 history. For the quarter, the company spent $24.7 billion, up 0.7% from Q2 2022's $24.6 billion. Apple holds 18 of the top 20 record quarters (Meta Platforms holds #11 and QUALCOMM holds #12). For the 12-months ending September 2022, Apple spent $95.6 billion on buybacks, up from the prior 12-month's $92.5 billion. Over the five-year period, they have spent $409.1 billion and $582.0 billion over the ten-year period.Alphabet (GOOG/L): was next with $15.4 billion for Q3 2022, up from $15.2 billion in Q2 2022; the 12-month September 2022 expenditure was $57.4 billion versus the 12-month September 2021 expenditure of $44.7 billion.Meta Platforms (META): $7.4 billion for Q3 2022, up from $6.2 billion in Q2 2022; the 12-month September 2022 expenditure was $45.6 billion versus $31.5 billion.Microsoft (MSFT): $5.6 billion for Q3 2022, down from $8.8 billion in Q2 2022; the 12-month September 2022 expenditure was $30.6 billion versus $28.3 billion.Exxon Mobile (XOM): returning to the top five for the first time since Q3 2014, the former poster child of buybacks spent $4.5 billion in Q3 2022, up from $3.9 billion in Q2 2022 and nothing in Q3 2021; the 12-month September 2022 expenditure was $10.6 billion versus $0.1 billion.For more information about S&amp;P Dow Jones Indices, please visit www.spdji.com.

Specifically, 86% of dog parents and 78% of cat parents.Pet Parents spend on average 8.5-9.5 hours per day with their pet.

Now that the Sam Bankman-Fried news is beginning to subside, Fed Chair Jerome Powell is reemerging as crypto’s primary antagonist, even if unintentionally so.The takeaway is that crypto assets prices will largely be driven by inflation figures, the size of the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet and market interpretations of Fed officials’ statements.

The yellow metal is trading slightly lower for 2022, and is also down substantially from peaks hit during the initial days of the Russia-Ukraine conflict.Spot gold fell 0.1% to $1,785.46 an ounce, while gold futures fell 0.2% to $1,794.60 an ounce by 19:25 ET (00:25 GMT).The latest selling pressure on gold comes from a series of hawkish central bank comments last week, which heralded a continued rise in interest rates in the coming year. The trend spells more pressure on gold and other metals, as rising rates battered the metals market by driving up the opportunity cost of holding non-yielding assets.Investors are now also concerned over a potential recession in 2023, driven chiefly by high inflation and rising interest rates.Focus on slowing economic growth is also expected to define the last two trading weeks of 2022 amid a dearth of other cues. Trading volumes are also expected to be diminished by a series of market holidays.Other precious metals also retreated on Tuesday.Among industrial metals, copper prices were steadier than their peers amid continued bets that an economic recovery in China will fuel copper demand.Copper futures rose 0.1% to $3.7637 a pound.But the red metal’s outlook remains clouded by uncertainty over a global recession, with weakening economic activity across the globe likely to offset a demand recovery in major importer China.Story continuesStill, tightening copper supply, due to political unrest in top producers Chile and Peru, is likely to help support prices in the coming months.Related ArticlesGold prices slip further below $1,800 as rate hike fears weighOil climbs, but uncertainty on China COVID surge caps gainsRainforest-rich nations ensure COP15 deal on nature sticks]"

The sol rose 0.3% after Peruvian President Dina Boluarte, who is leading a transitional government following the ouster of her predecessor, said she will replace the prime minister as part of a reshuffling of her Cabinet. ""The move is Boluarte's attempt to seek support in order to approve early elections amid ongoing protests,"" Citi strategists wrote in a client note. ""She declared the reshuffling aims to build a 'political team' to facilitate dialogue in the country, and said the new elections cannot be held without new political reforms."" Currencies of oil exporters Mexico and Colombia added 0.4% and 0.2% respectively as crude prices rose on hopes of a recovery in demand. Mexico's economy likely contracted by 0.1% in November compared with the previous month, a preliminary estimate from national statistics agency INEGI showed. The dollar retreated from a rally supported by hawkish tones from major central banks last week. Brazil's real reversed losses and climbed 0.3% as President-elect Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva scored two key victories after the Supreme Court granted an injunction allowing him to increase social investment, while also outlawing an opaque congressional spending program. Investors are still awaiting a decision by Brazil's lower house to increase the spending cap by 145 billion reais ($27.8 billion) for each year to cover payments of 600 reais a month under the Bolsa Familia welfare program. It was approved by the Senate in early December. ""There is a really good story developing in Brazil,"" said Edmund Shing, chief investment officer at BNP Paribas Wealth Management. ""You have a very strong commodity backdrop, with both mining and oil; secondly, you have a government that has been successful before, the market may see that the political climate will be more stable than it was under Bolsonaro; and thirdly, interest rates are already incredibly high in Brazil."" Still, gains in most Latin American currencies were limited after China officially reported its first coronavirus-related deaths since unwinding some of its strictest pandemic control measures earlier this month. Chile's peso dipped 0.4% as concerns about China's efforts to exit from its zero-COVID strategies outweighed a rise in prices of copper, the South American country's main export. Latin American economies, which rely heavily on China as a trading partner, have been bogged down by worries that Beijing's rapid easing of COVID-19 control measures could lead to more infections and further disruptions to demand. Still, the MSCI's index for Latam stocks has fared relatively better compared to others for the year, falling about 2.6% compared to a much steeper 22.3% slide in the broader emerging markets equities index. Among other emerging market currencies, South Africa's rand jumped 1.9% as investors cheered Ramaphosa's re-election, as he beat out Zweli Mkhize, a former health minister, in the race.

Meanwhile, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenue is projecting net sales of $9.6 billion, down 10.32% from the year-ago period.QCOM's full-year Zacks Consensus Estimates are calling for earnings of $10.19 per share and revenue of $40.07 billion. These results would represent year-over-year changes of -18.68% and -9.34%, respectively.It is also important to note the recent changes to analyst estimates for Qualcomm.

So, it might be a good idea to review some of the factors that might affect the near-term performance of the stock.Over the past month, shares of this homebuilder have returned +8.1%, compared to the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's -2.7% change. During this period, the Zacks Building Products - Home Builders industry, which PulteGroup falls in, has gained 7.3%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?Although media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.Revisions to Earnings EstimatesRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.We essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.PulteGroup is expected to post earnings of $2.90 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +15.5%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -0.6%.For the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $10.14 points to a change of +38.9% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has changed -0.2%.For the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $7.05 indicates a change of -30.5% from what PulteGroup is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -0.6%.Story continuesWith an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) for PulteGroup.The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPS12-month consensus EPS estimate for PHM _12MonthEPSChartUrlRevenue Growth ForecastEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.For PulteGroup, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $4.6 billion indicates a year-over-year change of +5.6%. For the current and next fiscal years, $15.66 billion and $14.53 billion estimates indicate +12.5% and -7.3% changes, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryPulteGroup reported revenues of $3.94 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +13.4%. EPS of $2.69 for the same period compares with $1.82 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $4.04 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of -2.49%. The EPS surprise was -1.47%.Over the last four quarters, PulteGroup surpassed consensus EPS estimates three times. The company topped consensus revenue estimates two times over this period.ValuationNo investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.Comparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.As part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.PulteGroup is graded D on this front, indicating that it is trading at a premium to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.ConclusionThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about PulteGroup. However, its Zacks Rank #5 does suggest that it may underperform the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

153,9b203d36-2e78-3c3a-8649-7fe83d5a92b6,PHM,2022-12-20,5 Homebuilder Stocks to Buy for Bottom Fishing Investors,InvestorPlace,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/5-homebuilder-stocks-buy-bottom-193806851.html,1671219486,STORY,"['DHI', 'LEN-B', 'TOL', 'PHM', 'MTH']","[The housing market is a mess. Homebuilder stocks are suffering.There are many reasons for this. Boomers refuse to move out. Millennial buyers can’t move in. So-called “starter homes” that brought generations into the market are now unaffordable for many.The problem is homebuyers don’t just buy houses. We also buy the money to buy houses. For the first time in decades, that debt costs a lot, with interest rates for 30-year mortgages now well over 6%.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsWhen was the last time the market was this bad? It was when I bought my first house. I paid $49,500 in 1984. That’s the equivalent of $142,000 today. But I also paid 13% to finance the purchase. In terms of affordability, we’re in the same place we were back then.Housing stocks are now super-cheap, most selling for price-to-earnings ratios around 5-times. But many analysts are still warning investors away. They see falling sales, rising costs, and big trouble ahead.Why would anyone consider investing in the stock of a company that builds houses? Because recessions end, interest rates fluctuate, and this, too, shall pass. Because, in many cases, investors are fearing the future and ignoring the present.I am not the only one who believes this. Warren Buffett of Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRK-A) believes it, too. Why else would he buy 7% of building supplier Louisiana-Pacific (NYSE:LP)?Those who are bullish on housing say the builders are a lot like Louisiana-Pacific. No one wants them, so now is the time to look at them.On the theory that the harder they fall the faster they rise, here are five homebuilders to put on your radar. Those that have fallen hardest in 2022 are listed first, and those that have fallen the least are listed last.TOLToll Brothers$50.08MTHMeritage Homes$92.29LENLennar$91.99PHMPulte Group$45.83DRID.R. Horton$87.97Toll Brothers (TOL)Toll Brothers Home construction company logo seen displayed on smart phoneSource: IgorGolovniov / Shutterstock.comStory continuesToll Brothers (NYSE:TOL), based north of Philadelphia in Fort Washington, has lost one-third of its value in 2022. Shares opened the year near $70 and will likely close near $50. But if you think the high end of the housing market will rebound first in 2023, this may be among the homebuilder stocks you’re looking for.Business at Toll Brothers isn’t bad. It’s quite good. For the three months ending in October, the company handily beat estimates with earnings of $640.5 million, or $5.63 per share, on revenue of $3.58 billion. It sold 3,765 homes with an average price near $1 million during the quarter. Additionally, the company reported a backlog of nearly 8,100 homes at the end of the period. Deliveries for the current quarter were estimated at 1,750-1,850 homes, or 8,000-9,000 for the coming fiscal year.However, Toll Brothers’ stock keeps getting hammered. It’s now trading right at its book value. The company’s price-to-earnings ratio is below 4.5. Its modest dividend of 19 cents per share still yields 1.58%. Yet, the average price target at Tipranks is just $55.20, 13% ahead of where it traded December 12.There is ample evidence for the short-term slowdown Toll Brothers expects. This is especially true for infill projects inside cities. A project around the corner from me is being slow-walked, the construction loan kept open in hopes a higher-interest mortgage won’t be needed. But the company is also still announcing larger suburban projects, like a 290-unit development in suburban Chamblee due for completion in 2024.The bear case for Toll Brothers stock is based on fear. High-priced homes and high-priced money are a wicked combination. But luxury homes are often bought for cash, by people who already own homes. Toll doubled-down on the infill segment in 2020, buying Sharp Homes and then Thrive Residential.If the coming recession doesn’t become a depression, Toll’s careful planning in 2022 should pay dividends for stockholders in what I view as one of the best homebuilder stocks out there.Meritage Homes (MTH)homebuildersSource: ©iStock.com/SashickIf the thesis behind Toll Brothers intrigues you, you can double down on it with a small bet on Meritage Homes (NYSE:MTH). The stock is down nearly 26% in 2022, but was recently rising off October lows of under $67.That’s because the Scottsdale, Arizona-based company has grown steadily for years, and is consistently profitable. Investors’ fears about the future has it selling at just $93 per share on December 13, or 3.6-times earnings. Additionally, the company’s market cap of $3.4 billion is just 60% of 2022’s sales. Those are the numbers of a low-margin retailer, not a company that brought 14% of revenue to its net income line last year.Even inside Meritage, confidence is low. Independent director Peter Axe sold $500,000 of stock recently, but most other insiders are hanging in. Like everyone else, they’re worried about plunging sales in the face of declining supply.The reason for the worry is interest rates. With rates at up to 7.5% on a 30-year mortgage, even for those who put 20% down, qualified buyers are hard to find.The question is, what if we’ve hit the peak in interest rates, as recent inflation data suggests? Inflation was 7.1% for the year ending in November, but up just 0.1% month-over month. Prices are falling for energy, rents, and many commodities. Maybe the market gets a spring thaw.If we do get a soft landing, the high end of the market should get help first. You’re highly leveraged to that on Meritage stock. Some analysts are already raising their ratings on Meritage. Zacks calls it a top momentum stock for the long term.Lennar (LEN)Lennar (LEN) website homepage. Lennar logo visible on the phone screenSource: madamF via ShutterstockLennar (NYSE:LEN) is the second-largest company among homebuilder stocks on this list, with a market cap of $26 billion. That’s down 21% for 2022, but the trend has been up since October, when it bottomed at $71. The stock was trading December 13 at over $91.Lennar is four-times bigger than Meritage, large enough to have sophisticated financial management. It also has imagination, evidenced by a small community of homes outside Austin, Texas it is building using 3D printing technologies.As the market seized up this fall, Lennar publicly offered to sell 5,000 new homes to big landlords, selling entire subdivisions at once. The average Lennar home sells for $500,000, but buying in bulk can bring big discounts.Those buyers may not exist, however. Blackstone (NYSE:BX) recently limited withdrawals from its residential housing fund. Some sales contracts have been cancelled.Lennar’s most recent earnings report showed net earnings per share up 11% and home deliveries up 13%. But that included 1,000 sales to rental operators, including its own operation, which has $1.25 billion in loans committed for such purchases. The company’s total long-term debt was nearly unchanged from a year earlier at $5.7 billion, with $13 billion in finished homes in inventory and cash of $1.5 billion.Anyone interested in buying a housing stock should look closely at Lennar’s November quarter numbers, which were due to be released December 15. These will give a good indication of the sector’s health.If Lennar’s numbers are better than feared, the stock should rise. The stock’s price-to-earnings ratio is just 6-times, and you get a 37.5 cent per share dividend that yields 1.7%. Most analysts seem to be holding their breath, maintaining their ratings, but with one-year price targets that are all over the map, from a low of $72 to a high of $133.PulteGroup (PHM)the PulteGroup logo seen displayed on a smartphoneSource: rafapress / Shutterstock.comPulteGroup (NYSE:PHM) stock was selling in mid-December for just 4.7-times earnings, after increasing its dividend for the fifth year in a row. Pulte’s target market is millennials and their boomer parents, with 43% of homes aimed at first-time buyers and 25% “active adult” communities under the DelWebb and DiVosta brands.The is among the homebuilder stocks with a bullish chart pattern that can’t get any love. Zacks recently rated the stock a strong sell because of what it called a “challenging housing market” in 2023.Their evidence comes from Pulte’s third quarter report. The company posted a miss on earnings at $2.69 per share, on revenue of $3.94 billion. But the miss was by just 4 cents per share. Earnings were up 48% year-over-year, with gross margins rising to over 30%.Management isn’t acting like a hard recession is coming. The cash balance of most homebuilder stocks is something to watch. In this case, company’s cash balance is down $1.5 billion in 2022. It all went into inventories of homes and land. That may be because Pulte is five years past a very public spat between founder Bill Pulte and William Dugas, who moved the company to Atlanta from Detroit. Dugas was pushed out in 2017 and replaced by current CEO James Marshall. Pulte died in 2018 and his grandson, who acted as his spokesman during the fight, is now building a new company as The Pulte Family. I believe the aggressive growth plan being pursued by Marshall today is a Pulte legacy.If the coming recession is worse than now feared, and if car-oriented suburbs are on the way out, then Pulte does have problems. But I don’t think that’s the way to bet.D.R. Horton (DHI)In this photo illustration the D.R. Horton (DRI) logo seen displayed on a smartphone.Source: Casimiro PT / Shutterstock.comIf you’re going to bet big, you’ll want to consider the biggest player among homebuilder stocks, D.R. Horton (NYSE:DHI). That’s the way Wall Street looks at it, too. The stock is down 19% in 2022, but that’s just slightly below the year’s fall in the average S&amp;P stock, which was down 16% in mid-December.Horton stands tall in terms of its financial strength. The Arlington, Texas company has a market cap of $30 billion, but that’s just 5.3-times last year’s earnings. Even if the company hits current estimates of a drop to $9.70 per share in earnings, it would have a price-earnings ratio of less than 9-times next year.Analysts worried about the sector insist DHI stock could fall 50% this year, but the company seems aware of the risks. In September, it held $2.57 billion in cash against an inventory of $21.66 billion in houses and land.As I wrote nearly three years ago, when DHI stock was 47% cheaper than today, Horton is a bet on the durability of American suburbs, the idea of “driving until you qualify” for a place to raise your kids. The model seemed under threat in the last decade, as young people flocked to cities, but the pandemic has given it new life.D.R. Horton builds homes for varying price points. They’re often of cookie-cutter construction, a problem when the environment won’t cooperate. The company and its critics are known for playing hardball, sometimes to a humorous extent. But it usually wins.Someday, the D.R. Horton model of suburbs far from jobs will stop working. But today is not that day. Barclay’s (NYSE:BCS) recently boosted its target on the stock to $108. If the coming housing recession is mild, it could easily clear that.On the date of publication, Dana Blankenhorn held no positions in any companies mentioned in this article.

They provide a low-cost, convenient and transparent way of replicating market returns.If you're the kind of investor who would rather try and beat the market through good stock selection, then smart beta funds are your best choice; this fund class is known for tracking non-cap weighted strategies.Based on specific fundamental characteristics, or a combination of such, these indexes attempt to pick stocks that have a better chance of risk-return performance.The smart beta space gives investors many different choices, from equal-weighting, one of the simplest strategies, to more complicated ones like fundamental and volatility/momentum based weighting. However, not all of these methodologies have been able to deliver remarkable returns.Fund Sponsor &amp; IndexBecause the fund has amassed over $760.88 million, this makes it one of the average sized ETFs in the Style Box - Large Cap Value. OUSA is managed by Alps. Before fees and expenses, this particular fund seeks to match the performance of the FTSE US Qual / Vol / Yield Factor 5% Capped Index.The OShares U.S. Quality Dividend Index measures the performance of publicly-listed large-capitalization and mid-capitalization dividend-paying issuers in the United States.Cost &amp; Other ExpensesInvestors should also pay attention to an ETF's expense ratio. Lower cost products will produce better results than those with a higher cost, assuming all other metrics remain the same.Story continuesAnnual operating expenses for OUSA are 0.48%, which makes it on par with most peer products in the space.Sector Exposure and Top HoldingsMost ETFs are very transparent products, and disclose their holdings on a daily basis. ETFs also offer diversified exposure, which minimizes single stock risk, though it's still important for investors to research a fund's holdings.This ETF has heaviest allocation in the Healthcare sector - about 23.10% of the portfolio. Information Technology and Financials round out the top three.Taking into account individual holdings, Johnson &amp; Johnson (JNJ) accounts for about 5.84% of the fund's total assets, followed by Procter &amp; Gamble Co. (PG) and Verizon Communications Inc. (VZ).OUSA's top 10 holdings account for about 40.03% of its total assets under management.Performance and RiskThe ETF has lost about -16.44% and is down about -4.26% so far this year and in the past one year (as of 12/20/2022), respectively. OUSA has traded between $38.45 and $46.65 during this last 52-week period.With about 100 holdings, it effectively diversifies company-specific risk.AlternativesALPS O'Shares U.S. Quality Dividend ETF is a reasonable option for investors seeking to outperform the Style Box - Large Cap Value segment of the market. However, there are other ETFs in the space which investors could consider.IShares Russell 1000 Value ETF (IWD) tracks Russell 1000 Value Index and the Vanguard Value ETF (VTV) tracks CRSP U.S. Large Cap Value Index. IShares Russell 1000 Value ETF has $52.87 billion in assets, Vanguard Value ETF has $97.08 billion. IWD has an expense ratio of 0.18% and VTV charges 0.04%.Investors looking for cheaper and lower-risk options should consider traditional market cap weighted ETFs that aim to match the returns of the Style Box - Large Cap Value.Bottom LineTo learn more about this product and other ETFs, screen for products that match your investment objectives and read articles on latest developments in the ETF investing universe, please visit Zacks ETF Center.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

This change was narrower than the S&amp;P 500's 0.9% loss on the day. At the same time, the Dow lost 0.5%, and the tech-heavy Nasdaq lost 0.27%.Heading into today, shares of the world's biggest maker of health care products had lost 0.3% over the past month, lagging the Medical sector's gain of 2.93% and outpacing the S&amp;P 500's loss of 2.66% in that time.Wall Street will be looking for positivity from Johnson &amp; Johnson as it approaches its next earnings report date. This is expected to be January 24, 2023. In that report, analysts expect Johnson &amp; Johnson to post earnings of $2.22 per share. This would mark year-over-year growth of 4.23%. Meanwhile, our latest consensus estimate is calling for revenue of $23.79 billion, down 4.1% from the prior-year quarter.Looking at the full year, our Zacks Consensus Estimates suggest analysts are expecting earnings of $10.04 per share and revenue of $95.02 billion. These totals would mark changes of +2.45% and +1.33%, respectively, from last year.Any recent changes to analyst estimates for Johnson &amp; Johnson should also be noted by investors. These recent revisions tend to reflect the evolving nature of short-term business trends. As such, positive estimate revisions reflect analyst optimism about the company's business and profitability.Our research shows that these estimate changes are directly correlated with near-term stock prices. To benefit from this, we have developed the Zacks Rank, a proprietary model which takes these estimate changes into account and provides an actionable rating system.The Zacks Rank system ranges from #1 (Strong Buy) to #5 (Strong Sell). It has a remarkable, outside-audited track record of success, with #1 stocks delivering an average annual return of +25% since 1988. The Zacks Consensus EPS estimate has moved 0.03% lower within the past month. Johnson &amp; Johnson is holding a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold) right now.Story continuesInvestors should also note Johnson &amp; Johnson's current valuation metrics, including its Forward P/E ratio of 17.5. Its industry sports an average Forward P/E of 14.9, so we one might conclude that Johnson &amp; Johnson is trading at a premium comparatively.Investors should also note that JNJ has a PEG ratio of 3.48 right now. The PEG ratio is similar to the widely-used P/E ratio, but this metric also takes the company's expected earnings growth rate into account. JNJ's industry had an average PEG ratio of 2.15 as of yesterday's close.The Large Cap Pharmaceuticals industry is part of the Medical sector.

The Chief Inclusion &amp; Diversity Officer at Medtronic has overseen inclusion, diversity, and equity (ID&amp;E) at Medtronic since 2020.Having a leader who can drive the strategic work of both the Medtronic Foundation and inclusion, diversity, and equity (ID&amp;E) at Medtronic and will help us take on the toughest equity challenges and take our employee engagement in community to the next level.We caught up with Dr. Saba to hear why this approach matters - and how it will work.Q: What does the Medtronic Foundation do?A: When I think of the sixth tenet of the Medtronic Mission to be a good corporate citizen, I can't help but think about the Medtronic Foundation because they envision a world where there are no barriers to achieving health, wellbeing, and prosperity. It exemplifies our commitment as a purpose driven company.Q: Combining leadership for these two areas seems like an innovative approach. How will it advance equity?A: I think it's important to understand the ID&amp;E strategy at Medtronic to see the commonalities. Our approach to ID&amp;E is based on three things - what we can each do as an individual, what our company is doing, and how we show up in community. Under the community pillar, one thing we're working on is advancing diversity in STEM.In fact, GIDE and the Medtronic Foundation have already worked together to establish several multi-year, multi-million dollar efforts with groups like Thurgood Marshall Fund and Society for Hispanic Professional Engineers that are helping to ensure diverse talent has access (scholarships funded by the Medtronic Foundation) and opportunity (internships formalized with the company). This is just one example of the impact we can have through partnership.While each group still has important, independent work it needs to and will continue to drive, I'm excited to unleash the full potential of what's possible.Story continuesQ: What is the key takeaway for our readers?A: The most important thing for people to know is that our commitment to ID&amp;E is unwavering, and this change only reinforces that. We know equity starts beyond our workplace and systemic inequities can't be solved by one entity alone. They require all stakeholders to come together in earnest partnership to solve our communities' biggest challenges. This foundation enables us to be deeply involved in our communities and envision a future where every member of our diverse communities can thrive and reach their fullest potential.Our unwavering commitment to inclusion, diversity, and equity (ID&amp;E) means working toward zero barriers to opportunity.

Increasing investments in research and development by medical technology firms, combined with favorable policies and regulations, are anticipated to advance the medical device industry over the next few years. Following the pandemic years, digital healthcare has become indispensable, and the medical technology industry has seen meaningful demand for online medical and AI-powered technology services. Companies in the digital healthcare space have witnessed their stocks rally despite economic turbulence. During the pandemic, seeing the accelerating demand for medtech treatment options, many conventional healthcare companies transformed themselves and offered technology-led health solutions to survive and gain market share. Some of the most popular medtech solutions include telemedicine, robotic surgery, medical imaging technologies, wearable medical devices, and AI-led healthcare management options. Investors seeking exposure to the medical technology sector can pick up stocks like DexCom, Inc. (NASDAQ:DXCM), Intuitive Surgical, Inc. (NASDAQ:ISRG), and Danaher Corporation (NYSE:DHR). Our Methodology We selected the following medical technology stocks based on positive analyst coverage, strong business fundamentals, and market visibility. We have assessed the hedge fund sentiment from Insider Monkey’s database of 920 elite hedge funds tracked as of the end of the third quarter of 2022. The list is arranged according to the number of hedge fund holders in each firm. Best Medical Technology Stocks to Buy11. Stryker Corporation (NYSE:SYK)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 34Stryker Corporation (NYSE:SYK) is a Michigan-based medical technology company that operates through two segments – MedSurg and Neurotechnology, and Orthopaedics and Spine. The company offers implants for use in joint replacements and trauma surgeries. Stryker Corporation (NYSE:SYK) also provides surgical equipment and surgical navigation systems, endoscopic and communications systems, emergency medical equipment, intensive care disposable products, and reprocessed and remanufactured medical devices. Story continuesOn December 7, Stryker Corporation (NYSE:SYK) declared a $0.75 per share quarterly dividend, a 7.9% increase from its prior dividend of $0.695. The dividend is payable on January 31, 2023 to shareholders of record on December 30. The dividend yield on December 19 came in at 1.25%. Cowen analyst Joshua Jennings on December 14 raised the price target on Stryker Corporation (NYSE:SYK) to $283 from $233 and kept an Outperform rating on the shares. The analyst said the company looks positioned to provide positive 2023 revenue guidance on the back of a strong fourth quarter.According to Insider Monkey’s data, 34 hedge funds were bullish on Stryker Corporation (NYSE:SYK) at the end of September 2022, compared to 46 funds in the prior quarter. Terry Smith’s Fundsmith LLP is the largest stakeholder of the company, with 5.6 million shares worth $1.14 billion.Like DexCom, Inc. (NASDAQ:DXCM), Intuitive Surgical, Inc. (NASDAQ:ISRG), and Danaher Corporation (NYSE:DHR), Stryker Corporation (NYSE:SYK) is one of the premier medical technology stocks to consider. Diamond Hill Capital made the following comment about Stryker Corporation (NYSE:SYK) in its Q3 2022 investor letter:“Stryker Corporation (NYSE:SYK) was the only new addition to the portfolio in Q3. It is one of the largest medical device manufacturers with a track record of consistently outgrowing its end markets and competitors. Stryker has a highly performance driven culture with a decentralized operating model that results in strong incentive alignment within the company. We believe the management team has executed well, making small but meaningful decisions that have positioned the firm well among competitors. Management operates with a market share gain mentality and strives to be a category leader in the market they are in. Stryker also benefits from its broad portfolio of surgical tools, small and large cap hospital equipment, waste management products, etc., which enables it to address all the needs of a hospital operating room and be a one-stop shop for health care facilities. This is particularly appealing to hospitals, and it positions Stryker to be the supplier of all operating room equipment versus a single product, thus enabling the company to gain market share.”10. Inspire Medical Systems, Inc. (NYSE:INSP)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 37Inspire Medical Systems, Inc. (NYSE:INSP) is a Minnesota-based medical technology company focused on the development and commercialization of minimally invasive solutions for patients with obstructive sleep apnea in the United States and internationally. It is one of the best medical technology stocks to invest in. On November 1, Inspire Medical Systems, Inc. (NYSE:INSP) reported a revenue of $109.2 million, up 77.0% year-over-year, beating Wall Street estimates by $14.59 million. Inspire Medical Systems, Inc. (NYSE:INSP) raised its full-year 2022 revenue guidance to between $384 million to $388 million, which would represent growth of 65% to 66% over the 2021 revenue of $233.4 million. This compares to the prior revenue guidance of $354 million to $362 million and a Wall Street estimate of $361.29 million.Goldman Sachs analyst Amit Hazan upgraded Inspire Medical Systems, Inc. (NYSE:INSP) on December 13 to Buy from Neutral with a price target of $308, up from $245. Given ""strong visibility"" and the company's ""track record of execution,"" the analyst sees upside to present consensus and expects ""strong"" upcoming 2023 guidance. Given multiple compression over the last six months relative to the group, the shares now offer improved better risk/reward, added the analyst, who categorized Inspire Medical Systems, Inc. (NYSE:INSP) as his top Medtech midcap for 2023.According to Insider Monkey’s data, Inspire Medical Systems, Inc. (NYSE:INSP) was part of 37 hedge fund portfolios at the end of Q3 2022, compared to 31 in the prior quarter. Andreas Halvorsen’s Viking Global held the largest stake in the company, comprising 633,572 shares worth $112.3 million. Here is what Alger Capital specifically said about Inspire Medical Systems, Inc. (NYSE:INSP) in its Q2 2022 investor letter:“Inspire Medical Systems, Inc. (NYSE:INSP) markets the only FDA-approved implantable neuromodulation device used to treat obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). Inspire’s device monitors a patient’s breathing and delivers electrical stimulation to the hypoglossal nerve in order to maintain an open airway.We believe the second quarter underperformance of Inspire shares is primarily attributable to the rotation away from high-growth, high-valuation health care names that are currently unprofitable. Additionally, we think the underperformance was compounded by Inspire being one of the best-performing medical device stocks in the first quarter. We believe many investors have been “selling the winners” in a risk-off environment. Looking ahead, we continue to believe that Inspire is one of the best growth opportunities in medical devices with no anticipated immediate competition. We also believe its market is highly underpenetrated.”9. Align Technology, Inc. (NASDAQ:ALGN)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 38Align Technology, Inc. (NASDAQ:ALGN) is an Arizona-based medical device company that designs, manufactures, and markets Invisalign clear aligners and iTero intraoral scanners and services for restorative and aesthetic dentistry. On October 31, Align Technology, Inc. (NASDAQ:ALGN) announced an accelerated stock repurchase agreement with Goldman Sachs to repurchase $200 million of its common stock as part of the $1 billion share repurchase program disclosed in May. The transaction will be funded with cash on hand and is expected to conclude by February 1, 2023. Align Technology, Inc. (NASDAQ:ALGN) is one of the premier medical technology stocks to monitor. On October 27, Stifel analyst Jonathan Block maintained a Buy recommendation on Align Technology, Inc. (NASDAQ:ALGN) but lowered the price target on the shares to $265 from $325. Following the company's Q3 results and guidance, 2022 and 2023 EBITDA and EPS estimates are likely to ""come toppling down,"" said the analyst. Now, investors ""will have to decide if the tables could turn in coming quarters,"" noted Block, who added that comps will ease, innovation should improve, and that Align Technology, Inc. (NASDAQ:ALGN)’s market share ""seems to be relatively resilient.""According to Insider Monkey’s data, 38 hedge funds were bullish on Align Technology, Inc. (NASDAQ:ALGN) at the end of September 2022, compared to 33 funds in the last quarter. Brian Bares’ Bares Capital Management is the largest position holder in the company, with 913,324 shares worth over $189 million. Here is what Polen Global Growth has to say about Align Technology, Inc. (NASDAQ:ALGN) in its Q2 2022 investor letter:“Align Technology shares declined significantly during the second quarter when management reported a meaningful deceleration in growth. Management cited a host of challenges, including COVID19 impacts, especially in China with restrictions and lockdowns under their zero-COVID policy, a weaker economic environment, inflationary pressures, supply chain disruptions, and the war in Ukraine, to name a few. Tough comparisons were also a reality — Invisalign case starts in 1Q22 were roughly flat, having lapped the 66% growth from the prior year. It’s not completely surprising that growth is slowing on such tough comparisons, but the company’s shares declined on the news.By looking at Align’s three-year compound average growth rate (CAGR) to smooth out the ups and downs through COVID, key metrics like Invisalign case shipment, clear aligner revenue, and earnings per share have all grown ~20% during the trailing three years. We think this is quite respectable given the challenges during this period, but the lack of near-term momentum or visibility has not been well received in the current environment. According to our research, Align is the clear market leader, has global scale, a superior product, and still very modest market penetration. While growth may be challenged near term, we remain confident in the long-term growth opportunity.”8. Veeva Systems Inc. (NYSE:VEEV)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 42Veeva Systems Inc. (NYSE:VEEV) is a California-based company that provides cloud-based software for the life sciences industry in North America, Europe, the Asia Pacific, the Middle East, Africa, and Latin America. The company offers customer relationship management and data management applications for the medical industry. It is one of the premier medical technology stocks to monitor. On December 1, Veeva Systems Inc. (NYSE:VEEV) reported a Q3 non-GAAP EPS of $1.13 and a revenue of $552.35 million, outperforming Wall Street estimates by $0.06 and $6.29 million, respectively. Non-GAAP operating income for the third quarter was $219.5 million, compared to $199.4 million a year ago, representing an increase of 10% year-over-year.KeyBanc analyst Scott Schoenhaus on December 5 maintained an Overweight rating on Veeva Systems Inc. (NYSE:VEEV) but lowered the price target on the shares to $210 from $220 to reflect some multiple impairment as the company works toward moving its CRM business from Salesforce to its Vault Platform when the contract expires in September 2025. The analyst noted the company posted a strong quarter with top and bottom-line beats, but guided slightly below expectations on Q4 billings, revenue, and operating profits.According to Insider Monkey’s third quarter database, 42 hedge funds were long Veeva Systems Inc. (NYSE:VEEV), compared to 45 funds in the prior quarter. Greg Poole’s Echo Street Capital Management is the largest position holder in the company, with 899,876 shares worth $148.3 million. Here is what Artisan Partners specifically said about Veeva Systems Inc. (NYSE:VEEV) in its Q2 2022 investor letter:“Veeva Systems Inc. (NYSE:VEEV) is one of the highest quality franchises in our portfolio. The company has the dominant CRM platform for pharmaceutical sales and marketing organizations, and it is replicating that success with the rollout of numerous other modules focused on pharmaceutical customers’ manufacturing, quality, safety and clinical operations. Growth has temporarily slowed over the past year as the company laps difficult YoY comparisons caused by the rapid adoption of their virtual sales call solution during the pandemic. Several large deals also encountered unexpected delays in late 2021. Despite these short-term headwinds, we remain confident in Veeva’s future growth prospects and high-quality business model (~40% free cash flow margins supported by largely recurring subscription revenues). Meanwhile, we believe the defensive nature of its end market (health care) and strategic importance of cloud IT driven transformations could help buffer the company against a weaker global economy. As shares declined in Q2 along with other software stocks, we added to our position.”7. Bio-Rad Laboratories, Inc. (NYSE:BIO)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 45Bio-Rad Laboratories, Inc. (NYSE:BIO) is one of the best medical technology stocks to consider buying. The California-based company manufactures and distributes life science research and clinical diagnostic products in the United States, Europe, Asia, Canada, and Latin America.

It is one of the leading medical technology stocks to buy. On December 6, RBC Capital analyst Conor McNamara initiated coverage of Bio-Rad Laboratories, Inc. (NYSE:BIO) with an Outperform rating and a $565 price target. He believes shareholders will benefit from ""an extended period of multiple expansion"" as the company continues to deliver revenue acceleration and margin improvement. The stock trades at a 60%-70% discount to peers and with $200 per share in cash and investments has ""the most balance sheet optionality of any company in our sector,"" the analyst noted.According to Insider Monkey’s data, 45 hedge funds were bullish on Bio-Rad Laboratories, Inc. (NYSE:BIO) at the end of the third quarter of 2022, compared to 43 funds in the prior quarter. Israel Englander’s Millennium Management is the biggest position holder in the company, with 458,645 shares worth $191.3 million. 6.

The analyst updated his 2024 and forward EPS forecast for Medtronic plc (NYSE:MDT), as he factored in the FX impact on EPS.According to Insider Monkey’s third quarter database, 55 hedge funds were bullish on Medtronic plc (NYSE:MDT), compared to 54 funds in the earlier quarter. Peter Rathjens, Bruce Clarke, and John Campbell’s Arrowstreet Capital is the largest stakeholder of the company, with 7.16 million shares worth $578.30 million. Like DexCom, Inc. (NASDAQ:DXCM), Intuitive Surgical, Inc. (NASDAQ:ISRG), and Danaher Corporation (NYSE:DHR), Medtronic plc (NYSE:MDT) is one of the best medical technology stocks to invest in. Here is what Artisan Partners specifically said about Medtronic plc (NYSE:MDT) in its Q2 2022 investor letter:“While Medtronic plc (NYSE:MDT)’s procedure volumes recovered to pre-COVID levels, foreign exchange headwinds overshadowed underlying business value growth, and supply chain issues, including those related to China’s lockdowns, impacted the surgical innovations business. The downdraft in the market during the quarter led to a pile-on. We are being patient with our investment in Medtronic because the company continues to be a strong free cash flow generator and is attractively priced, with a FCF yield of 5% on trailing one-year numbers and a dividend yield of 3%. Medtronic is under new management that is focused on growing the company’s top line, reinvesting in R&amp;D, returning cash to shareholders and growing operating profits. We like new management’s strategy and believe new product launches, increased surgery visits, sound M&amp;A transactions and a shareholder returns focus, should reinvigorate the business. We added to our positions in these health care names during the quarter.” Click to continue reading and see 5 Best Medical Technology Stocks To Buy.  Suggested articles:12 Dividend Stocks That Outperform S&amp;P 50010 Stocks Under $5 With High Potential10 Best Performing Technology ETFs in 2022 Disclosure: None. 11 Best Medical Technology Stocks To Buy is originally published on Insider Monkey.]"

The respective sBLAs are supported by efficacy and safety data from the phase 1b/2 EV-103 trial (NCT03288545, also known as KEYNOTE-869) Dose Escalation/Cohort A and Cohort K. Results from Dose Escalation/Cohort A were published in the Journal of Clinical Oncology.1 Results from Cohort K were presented in a late-breaking session at the 2022 European Society for Medical Oncology (ESMO) Congress.2Story continues""Urothelial cancer, the most common type of bladder cancer, is associated with poor survival in the advanced stage,"" said Marjorie Green, M.D., Senior Vice President and Head of Late-Stage Development, Seagen. ""The investigational results from our clinical development program support the combination of PADCEV and KEYTRUDA as a potential treatment for this patient population.""Please see Important Safety Information at the end of this press release for both drugs, including a warning and precaution for immune-mediated adverse reactions for pembrolizumab and BOXED WARNING for PADCEV (enfortumab vedotin-ejfv) for serious skin reactions.""Despite advancements in treatment options, approximately half of advanced bladder cancer patients in the U.S. are ineligible for cisplatin-based chemotherapy, and these patients need new options. We are encouraged by the investigational results of the combination of PADCEV and KEYTRUDA for this patient population and are fully committed to work to bring this new approach forward to patients,"" said Dr. Eliav Barr, Senior Vice President, Head of Global Clinical Development and Chief Medical Officer, Merck Research Laboratories.Seagen, Astellas and Merck are further investigating enfortumab vedotin plus pembrolizumab in the ongoing phase 3 EV-302 study (NCT04223856, also known as KEYNOTE-A39), evaluating the clinical benefit for the investigational treatment combination in patients with previously untreated advanced urothelial cancer. The trial is intended to serve as the confirmatory trial for the potential accelerated approval in the U.S. and serve as the basis for global registration.The studies are part of an extensive program evaluating this combination in multiple stages of urothelial cancer, including two phase 3 clinical trials in muscle-invasive bladder cancer in EV-304 (NCT04700124, also known as KEYNOTE-B15) and EV-303 (NCT03924895, also known as KEYNOTE-905).About Bladder and Urothelial CancerIt is estimated that approximately 81,180 people in the U.S. were diagnosed with bladder cancer in 2022.3 Urothelial cancer accounts for 90% of all bladder cancers and can also be found in the renal pelvis, ureter and urethra.4 Approximately 12% of cases are locally advanced or metastatic urothelial cancer at diagnosis.5 Globally, approximately 573,000 new cases of bladder cancer and 212,000 deaths are reported annually.6About the EV-103/KEYNOTE-869 TrialThe EV-103 trial (NCT03288545) is an ongoing, multi-cohort, open-label, multicenter phase 1b/2 study of enfortumab vedotin alone or in combination with pembrolizumab and/or chemotherapy in first- or second-line settings in patients with locally advanced or metastatic urothelial cancer (la/mUC) and in patients with muscle-invasive bladder cancer.About PADCEVPADCEV (enfortumab vedotin-ejfv) is a first-in-class antibody-drug conjugate (ADC) that is directed against Nectin-4, a protein located on the surface of cells and highly expressed in bladder cancer.7 Nonclinical data suggest the anticancer activity of PADCEV is due to its binding to Nectin-4-expressing cells followed by the internalization and release of the anti-tumor agent monomethyl auristatin E (MMAE) into the cell, which result in the cell not reproducing (cell cycle arrest) and in programmed cell death (apoptosis).8PADCEV (enfortumab vedotin-ejfv) U.S. Indication &amp; Important Safety InformationBOXED WARNING: SERIOUS SKIN REACTIONSPADCEV can cause severe and fatal cutaneous adverse reactions including Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS) and Toxic Epidermal Necrolysis (TEN), which occurred predominantly during the first cycle of treatment, but may occur later.Closely monitor patients for skin reactions.Immediately withhold PADCEV and consider referral for specialized care for suspected SJS or TEN or severe skin reactions.Permanently discontinue PADCEV in patients with confirmed SJS or TEN; or Grade 4 or recurrent Grade 3 skin reactions.IndicationPADCEV® is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with locally advanced or metastatic urothelial cancer (mUC) who:have previously received a programmed death receptor-1 (PD-1) or programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) inhibitor and platinum-containing chemotherapy, orare ineligible for cisplatin-containing chemotherapy and have previously received one or more prior lines of therapy.8Important Safety InformationWarnings and PrecautionsSkin reactions Severe cutaneous adverse reactions, including fatal cases of SJS or TEN, occurred in patients treated with PADCEV. SJS and TEN occurred predominantly during the first cycle of treatment but may occur later. Skin reactions occurred in 55% of the 680 patients treated with PADCEV in clinical trials. Twenty-three percent (23%) of patients had maculo-papular rash and 33% had pruritus. Grade 3-4 skin reactions occurred in 13% of patients, including maculo-papular rash, rash erythematous, rash or drug eruption, symmetrical drug-related intertriginous and flexural exanthema (SDRIFE), dermatitis bullous, dermatitis exfoliative, and palmar-plantar erythrodysesthesia. In clinical trials, the median time to onset of severe skin reactions was 0.6 months (range: 0.1 to 6.4 months). Among patients experiencing a skin reaction leading to dose interruption who then restarted PADCEV (n=59), 24% of patients restarting at the same dose and 16% of patients restarting at a reduced dose experienced recurrent severe skin reactions. Skin reactions led to discontinuation of PADCEV in 2.6% of patients. Monitor patients closely throughout treatment for skin reactions. Consider topical corticosteroids and antihistamines, as clinically indicated. For persistent or recurrent Grade 2 skin reactions, consider withholding PADCEV until Grade ≤1. Withhold PADCEV and refer for specialized care for suspected SJS, TEN or for Grade 3 skin reactions. Permanently discontinue PADCEV in patients with confirmed SJS or TEN, or for Grade 4 or recurrent Grade 3 skin reactions.Hyperglycemia and diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA), including fatal events, occurred in patients with and without pre-existing diabetes mellitus, treated with PADCEV. Patients with baseline hemoglobin A1C ≥8% were excluded from clinical trials. In clinical trials, 14% of the 680 patients treated with PADCEV developed hyperglycemia; 7% of patients developed Grade 3-4 hyperglycemia. The incidence of Grade 3-4 hyperglycemia increased consistently in patients with higher body mass index and in patients with higher baseline A1C. Five percent (5%) of patients required initiation of insulin therapy for treatment of hyperglycemia. The median time to onset of hyperglycemia was 0.6 months (range: 0.1 to 20.3). Hyperglycemia led to discontinuation of PADCEV in 0.6% of patients. Closely monitor blood glucose levels in patients with, or at risk for, diabetes mellitus or hyperglycemia. If blood glucose is elevated (&gt;250 mg/dL), withhold PADCEV.Pneumonitis Severe, life-threatening or fatal pneumonitis occurred in patients treated with PADCEV. In clinical trials, 3.1% of the 680 patients treated with PADCEV had pneumonitis of any grade and 0.7% had Grade 3-4. In clinical trials, the median time to onset of pneumonitis was 2.9 months (range: 0.6 to 6 months). Monitor patients for signs and symptoms indicative of pneumonitis, such as hypoxia, cough, dyspnea or interstitial infiltrates on radiologic exams. Evaluate and exclude infectious, neoplastic and other causes for such signs and symptoms through appropriate investigations. Withhold PADCEV for patients who develop persistent or recurrent Grade 2 pneumonitis and consider dose reduction. Permanently discontinue PADCEV in all patients with Grade 3 or 4 pneumonitis.Peripheral neuropathy (PN) occurred in 52% of the 680 patients treated with PADCEV in clinical trials, including 39% with sensory neuropathy, 7% with muscular weakness and 6% with motor neuropathy; 4% experienced Grade 3-4 reactions. PN occurred in patients treated with PADCEV with or without pre-existing PN. The median time to onset of Grade ≥2 PN was 4.6 months (range: 0.1 to 15.8 months). Neuropathy led to treatment discontinuation in 5% of patients. Monitor patients for symptoms of new or worsening peripheral neuropathy and consider dose interruption or dose reduction of PADCEV when PN occurs. Permanently discontinue PADCEV in patients who develop Grade ≥3 PN.Ocular disorders were reported in 40% of the 384 patients treated with PADCEV in clinical trials in which ophthalmologic exams were scheduled. The majority of these events involved the cornea and included events associated with dry eye such as keratitis, blurred vision, increased lacrimation, conjunctivitis, limbal stem cell deficiency, and keratopathy. Dry eye symptoms occurred in 34% of patients, and blurred vision occurred in 13% of patients, during treatment with PADCEV. The median time to onset to symptomatic ocular disorder was 1.6 months (range: 0 to 19.1 months). Monitor patients for ocular disorders. Consider artificial tears for prophylaxis of dry eyes and ophthalmologic evaluation if ocular symptoms occur or do not resolve. Consider treatment with ophthalmic topical steroids, if indicated after an ophthalmic exam. Consider dose interruption or dose reduction of PADCEV for symptomatic ocular disorders.Infusion site extravasation Skin and soft tissue reactions secondary to extravasation have been observed after administration of PADCEV. Of the 680 patients, 1.6% of patients experienced skin and soft tissue reactions, including 0.3% who experienced Grade 3-4 reactions. Reactions may be delayed. Erythema, swelling, increased temperature, and pain worsened until 2-7 days after extravasation and resolved within 1-4 weeks of peak. Two patients (0.3%) developed extravasation reactions with secondary cellulitis, bullae, or exfoliation. Ensure adequate venous access prior to starting PADCEV and monitor for possible extravasation during administration. If extravasation occurs, stop the infusion and monitor for adverse reactions.Embryo-fetal toxicity PADCEV can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Advise patients of the potential risk to the fetus. Advise female patients of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during PADCEV treatment and for 2 months after the last dose.

Closely monitor patients for signs of toxicity when PADCEV is given concomitantly with dual P-gp and strong CYP3A4 inhibitors.Specific PopulationsLactation Advise lactating women not to breastfeed during treatment with PADCEV and for at least 3 weeks after the last dose.Hepatic impairment Avoid the use of PADCEV in patients with moderate or severe hepatic impairment.For more information, please see the full Prescribing Information including BOXED WARNING for PADCEV here.About KEYTRUDA® (pembrolizumab) injection, 100 mgKEYTRUDA is an anti-programmed death receptor-1 (PD-1) therapy that works by increasing the ability of the body’s immune system to help detect and fight tumor cells. KEYTRUDA is a humanized monoclonal antibody that blocks the interaction between PD-1 and its ligands, PD-L1 and PD-L2, thereby activating T lymphocytes which may affect both tumor cells and healthy cells.Merck has the industry’s largest immuno-oncology clinical research program. There are currently more than 1,600 trials studying KEYTRUDA across a wide variety of cancers and treatment settings. The KEYTRUDA clinical program seeks to understand the role of KEYTRUDA across cancers and the factors that may predict a patient's likelihood of benefitting from treatment with KEYTRUDA, including exploring several different biomarkers.Selected KEYTRUDA® (pembrolizumab) Indications in the U.S.Urothelial CarcinomaKEYTRUDA is indicated for the treatment of patients with locally advanced or metastatic urothelial carcinoma (mUC):who are not eligible for any platinum-containing chemotherapy, orwho have disease progression during or following platinum-containing chemotherapy or within 12 months of neoadjuvant or adjuvant treatment with platinum-containing chemotherapy.Non-muscle Invasive Bladder CancerKEYTRUDA is indicated for the treatment of patients with Bacillus Calmette-Guerin-unresponsive, high-risk, non-muscle invasive bladder cancer (NMIBC) with carcinoma in situ with or without papillary tumors who are ineligible for or have elected not to undergo cystectomy.See additional selected indications for KEYTRUDA in the U.S. after the Selected Important Safety Information.Selected Important Safety Information for KEYTRUDASevere and Fatal Immune-Mediated Adverse ReactionsKEYTRUDA is a monoclonal antibody that belongs to a class of drugs that bind to either the PD-1 or the PD-L1, blocking the PD-1/PD-L1 pathway, thereby removing inhibition of the immune response, potentially breaking peripheral tolerance and inducing immune-mediated adverse reactions. Immune-mediated adverse reactions, which may be severe or fatal, can occur in any organ system or tissue, can affect more than one body system simultaneously, and can occur at any time after starting treatment or after discontinuation of treatment. Important immune-mediated adverse reactions listed here may not include all possible severe and fatal immune-mediated adverse reactions.Monitor patients closely for symptoms and signs that may be clinical manifestations of underlying immune-mediated adverse reactions. Early identification and management are essential to ensure safe use of anti–PD-1/PD-L1 treatments. Evaluate liver enzymes, creatinine, and thyroid function at baseline and periodically during treatment. For patients with TNBC treated with KEYTRUDA in the neoadjuvant setting, monitor blood cortisol at baseline, prior to surgery, and as clinically indicated. In cases of suspected immune-mediated adverse reactions, initiate appropriate workup to exclude alternative etiologies, including infection. Institute medical management promptly, including specialty consultation as appropriate.Withhold or permanently discontinue KEYTRUDA depending on severity of the immune-mediated adverse reaction. In general, if KEYTRUDA requires interruption or discontinuation, administer systemic corticosteroid therapy (1 to 2 mg/kg/day prednisone or equivalent) until improvement to Grade 1 or less. Upon improvement to Grade 1 or less, initiate corticosteroid taper and continue to taper over at least 1 month. Consider administration of other systemic immunosuppressants in patients whose adverse reactions are not controlled with corticosteroid therapy.Immune-Mediated PneumonitisKEYTRUDA can cause immune-mediated pneumonitis. The incidence is higher in patients who have received prior thoracic radiation. Immune-mediated pneumonitis occurred in 3.4% (94/2799) of patients receiving KEYTRUDA, including fatal (0.1%), Grade 4 (0.3%), Grade 3 (0.9%), and Grade 2 (1.3%) reactions. Systemic corticosteroids were required in 67% (63/94) of patients. Pneumonitis led to permanent discontinuation of KEYTRUDA in 1.3% (36) and withholding in 0.9% (26) of patients. All patients who were withheld reinitiated KEYTRUDA after symptom improvement; of these, 23% had recurrence. Pneumonitis resolved in 59% of the 94 patients.Pneumonitis occurred in 8% (31/389) of adult patients with cHL receiving KEYTRUDA as a single agent, including Grades 3-4 in 2.3% of patients. Patients received high-dose corticosteroids for a median duration of 10 days (range: 2 days to 53 months). Pneumonitis rates were similar in patients with and without prior thoracic radiation. Pneumonitis led to discontinuation of KEYTRUDA in 5.4% (21) of patients. Of the patients who developed pneumonitis, 42% interrupted KEYTRUDA, 68% discontinued KEYTRUDA, and 77% had resolution.Immune-Mediated ColitisKEYTRUDA can cause immune-mediated colitis, which may present with diarrhea. Cytomegalovirus infection/reactivation has been reported in patients with corticosteroid-refractory immune-mediated colitis. In cases of corticosteroid-refractory colitis, consider repeating infectious workup to exclude alternative etiologies. Immune-mediated colitis occurred in 1.7% (48/2799) of patients receiving KEYTRUDA, including Grade 4 (&lt;0.1%), Grade 3 (1.1%), and Grade 2 (0.4%) reactions. Systemic corticosteroids were required in 69% (33/48); additional immunosuppressant therapy was required in 4.2% of patients. Colitis led to permanent discontinuation of KEYTRUDA in 0.5% (15) and withholding in 0.5% (13) of patients. All patients who were withheld reinitiated KEYTRUDA after symptom improvement; of these, 23% had recurrence. Colitis resolved in 85% of the 48 patients.Hepatotoxicity and Immune-Mediated HepatitisKEYTRUDA as a Single AgentKEYTRUDA can cause immune-mediated hepatitis. Immune-mediated hepatitis occurred in 0.7% (19/2799) of patients receiving KEYTRUDA, including Grade 4 (&lt;0.1%), Grade 3 (0.4%), and Grade 2 (0.1%) reactions.

Hepatitis resolved in 79% of the 19 patients.KEYTRUDA With AxitinibKEYTRUDA in combination with axitinib can cause hepatic toxicity. Monitor liver enzymes before initiation of and periodically throughout treatment. Consider monitoring more frequently as compared to when the drugs are administered as single agents. For elevated liver enzymes, interrupt KEYTRUDA and axitinib, and consider administering corticosteroids as needed. With the combination of KEYTRUDA and axitinib, Grades 3 and 4 increased alanine aminotransferase (ALT) (20%) and increased aspartate aminotransferase (AST) (13%) were seen at a higher frequency compared to KEYTRUDA alone. Fifty-nine percent of the patients with increased ALT received systemic corticosteroids. In patients with ALT ≥3 times upper limit of normal (ULN) (Grades 2-4, n=116), ALT resolved to Grades 0-1 in 94%. Among the 92 patients who were rechallenged with either KEYTRUDA (n=3) or axitinib (n=34) administered as a single agent or with both (n=55), recurrence of ALT ≥3 times ULN was observed in 1 patient receiving KEYTRUDA, 16 patients receiving axitinib, and 24 patients receiving both.

Severe or fatal cases have been reported for some of these adverse reactions. Cardiac/Vascular: Myocarditis, pericarditis, vasculitis; Nervous System: Meningitis, encephalitis, myelitis and demyelination, myasthenic syndrome/myasthenia gravis (including exacerbation), Guillain-Barré syndrome, nerve paresis, autoimmune neuropathy; Ocular: Uveitis, iritis and other ocular inflammatory toxicities can occur. Some cases can be associated with retinal detachment. Various grades of visual impairment, including blindness, can occur. If uveitis occurs in combination with other immune-mediated adverse reactions, consider a Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada-like syndrome, as this may require treatment with systemic steroids to reduce the risk of permanent vision loss; Gastrointestinal: Pancreatitis, to include increases in serum amylase and lipase levels, gastritis, duodenitis; Musculoskeletal and Connective Tissue: Myositis/polymyositis, rhabdomyolysis (and associated sequelae, including renal failure), arthritis (1.5%), polymyalgia rheumatica; Endocrine: Hypoparathyroidism; Hematologic/Immune: Hemolytic anemia, aplastic anemia, hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis, systemic inflammatory response syndrome, histiocytic necrotizing lymphadenitis (Kikuchi lymphadenitis), sarcoidosis, immune thrombocytopenic purpura, solid organ transplant rejection.Infusion-Related ReactionsKEYTRUDA can cause severe or life-threatening infusion-related reactions, including hypersensitivity and anaphylaxis, which have been reported in 0.2% of 2799 patients receiving KEYTRUDA. Monitor for signs and symptoms of infusion-related reactions. Interrupt or slow the rate of infusion for Grade 1 or Grade 2 reactions. For Grade 3 or Grade 4 reactions, stop infusion and permanently discontinue KEYTRUDA.Complications of Allogeneic Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation (HSCT)Fatal and other serious complications can occur in patients who receive allogeneic HSCT before or after anti–PD-1/PD-L1 treatments. Transplant-related complications include hyperacute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), acute and chronic GVHD, hepatic veno-occlusive disease after reduced intensity conditioning, and steroid-requiring febrile syndrome (without an identified infectious cause). These complications may occur despite intervening therapy between anti–PD-1/PD-L1 treatment and allogeneic HSCT. Follow patients closely for evidence of these complications and intervene promptly. Consider the benefit vs risks of using anti–PD-1/PD-L1 treatments prior to or after an allogeneic HSCT.Increased Mortality in Patients With Multiple MyelomaIn trials in patients with multiple myeloma, the addition of KEYTRUDA to a thalidomide analogue plus dexamethasone resulted in increased mortality. Treatment of these patients with an anti–PD-1/PD-L1 treatment in this combination is not recommended outside of controlled trials.Embryofetal ToxicityBased on its mechanism of action, KEYTRUDA can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Advise women of this potential risk.

We are encouraged by the investigational results of the combination of PADCEV and KEYTRUDA for this patient population and are fully committed to work to bring this new approach forward to patients,"" said Dr. Eliav Barr, Senior Vice President, Head of Global Clinical Development and Chief Medical Officer, Merck Research Laboratories.Astellas, Seagen and Merck are further investigating enfortumab vedotin plus pembrolizumab in the ongoing phase 3 EV-302 study (NCT04223856, also known as KEYNOTE-A39), evaluating the clinical benefit for the investigational treatment combination in patients with previously untreated advanced urothelial cancer. The trial is intended to serve as the confirmatory trial for the potential accelerated approval in the U.S. and serve as the basis for global registration.The studies are part of an extensive program evaluating this combination in multiple stages of urothelial cancer, including two phase 3 clinical trials in muscle-invasive bladder cancer in EV-304 (NCT04700124, also known as KEYNOTE-B15) and EV-303 (NCT03924895, also known as KEYNOTE-905).About Bladder and Urothelial CancerIt is estimated that approximately 81,180 people in the U.S. were diagnosed with bladder cancer in 2022.3 Urothelial cancer accounts for 90% of all bladder cancers and can also be found in the renal pelvis, ureter and urethra.4 Approximately 12% of cases are locally advanced or metastatic urothelial cancer at diagnosis.5 Globally, approximately 573,000 new cases of bladder cancer and 212,000 deaths are reported annually.6About the EV-103/KEYNOTE-869 Trial The EV-103 trial (NCT03288545) is an ongoing, multi-cohort, open-label, multicenter phase 1b/2 study of enfortumab vedotin alone or in combination with pembrolizumab and/or chemotherapy in first- or second-line settings in patients with locally advanced or metastatic urothelial cancer (la/mUC) and in patients with muscle-invasive bladder cancer.About PADCEVPADCEV (enfortumab vedotin-ejfv) is a first-in-class antibody-drug conjugate (ADC) that is directed against Nectin-4, a protein located on the surface of cells and highly expressed in bladder cancer.7 Nonclinical data suggest the anticancer activity of PADCEV is due to its binding to Nectin-4-expressing cells followed by the internalization and release of the anti-tumor agent monomethyl auristatin E (MMAE) into the cell, which result in the cell not reproducing (cell cycle arrest) and in programmed cell death (apoptosis).8PADCEV (enfortumab vedotin-ejfv) U.S. Indication &amp; Important Safety InformationBOXED WARNING: SERIOUS SKIN REACTIONSPADCEV can cause severe and fatal cutaneous adverse reactions including Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS) and Toxic Epidermal Necrolysis (TEN), which occurred predominantly during the first cycle of treatment, but may occur later.Closely monitor patients for skin reactions.Immediately withhold PADCEV and consider referral for specialized care for suspected SJS or TEN or severe skin reactions.Permanently discontinue PADCEV in patients with confirmed SJS or TEN; or Grade 4 or recurrent Grade 3 skin reactions.IndicationPADCEV® is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with locally advanced or metastatic urothelial cancer (mUC) who:have previously received a programmed death receptor-1 (PD-1) or programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) inhibitor and platinum-containing chemotherapy, orare ineligible for cisplatin-containing chemotherapy and have previously received one or more prior lines of therapy.8Important Safety Information Warnings and PrecautionsSkin reactions Severe cutaneous adverse reactions, including fatal cases of SJS or TEN, occurred in patients treated with PADCEV. SJS and TEN occurred predominantly during the first cycle of treatment but may occur later. Skin reactions occurred in 55% of the 680 patients treated with PADCEV in clinical trials. Twenty-three percent (23%) of patients had maculo-papular rash and 33% had pruritus. Grade 3-4 skin reactions occurred in 13% of patients, including maculo-papular rash, rash erythematous, rash or drug eruption, symmetrical drug-related intertriginous and flexural exanthema (SDRIFE), dermatitis bullous, dermatitis exfoliative, and palmar-plantar erythrodysesthesia. In clinical trials, the median time to onset of severe skin reactions was 0.6 months (range: 0.1 to 6.4 months). Among patients experiencing a skin reaction leading to dose interruption who then restarted PADCEV (n=59), 24% of patients restarting at the same dose and 16% of patients restarting at a reduced dose experienced recurrent severe skin reactions. Skin reactions led to discontinuation of PADCEV in 2.6% of patients. Monitor patients closely throughout treatment for skin reactions. Consider topical corticosteroids and antihistamines, as clinically indicated. For persistent or recurrent Grade 2 skin reactions, consider withholding PADCEV until Grade ≤1. Withhold PADCEV and refer for specialized care for suspected SJS, TEN or for Grade 3 skin reactions. Permanently discontinue PADCEV in patients with confirmed SJS or TEN, or for Grade 4 or recurrent Grade 3 skin reactions.Hyperglycemia and diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA), including fatal events, occurred in patients with and without pre-existing diabetes mellitus, treated with PADCEV. Patients with baseline hemoglobin A1C ≥8% were excluded from clinical trials. In clinical trials, 14% of the 680 patients treated with PADCEV developed hyperglycemia; 7% of patients developed Grade 3-4 hyperglycemia. The incidence of Grade 3-4 hyperglycemia increased consistently in patients with higher body mass index and in patients with higher baseline A1C. Five percent (5%) of patients required initiation of insulin therapy for treatment of hyperglycemia. The median time to onset of hyperglycemia was 0.6 months (range: 0.1 to 20.3). Hyperglycemia led to discontinuation of PADCEV in 0.6% of patients. Closely monitor blood glucose levels in patients with, or at risk for, diabetes mellitus or hyperglycemia. If blood glucose is elevated (&gt;250 mg/dL), withhold PADCEV.Pneumonitis Severe, life-threatening or fatal pneumonitis occurred in patients treated with PADCEV. In clinical trials, 3.1% of the 680 patients treated with PADCEV had pneumonitis of any grade and 0.7% had Grade 3-4. In clinical trials, the median time to onset of pneumonitis was 2.9 months (range: 0.6 to 6 months). Monitor patients for signs and symptoms indicative of pneumonitis, such as hypoxia, cough, dyspnea or interstitial infiltrates on radiologic exams. Evaluate and exclude infectious, neoplastic and other causes for such signs and symptoms through appropriate investigations. Withhold PADCEV for patients who develop persistent or recurrent Grade 2 pneumonitis and consider dose reduction. Permanently discontinue PADCEV in all patients with Grade 3 or 4 pneumonitis.Peripheral neuropathy (PN) occurred in 52% of the 680 patients treated with PADCEV in clinical trials, including 39% with sensory neuropathy, 7% with muscular weakness and 6% with motor neuropathy; 4% experienced Grade 3-4 reactions. PN occurred in patients treated with PADCEV with or without pre-existing PN. The median time to onset of Grade ≥2 PN was 4.6 months (range: 0.1 to 15.8 months). Neuropathy led to treatment discontinuation in 5% of patients. Monitor patients for symptoms of new or worsening peripheral neuropathy and consider dose interruption or dose reduction of PADCEV when PN occurs. Permanently discontinue PADCEV in patients who develop Grade ≥3 PN.Ocular disorders were reported in 40% of the 384 patients treated with PADCEV in clinical trials in which ophthalmologic exams were scheduled. The majority of these events involved the cornea and included events associated with dry eye such as keratitis, blurred vision, increased lacrimation, conjunctivitis, limbal stem cell deficiency, and keratopathy. Dry eye symptoms occurred in 34% of patients, and blurred vision occurred in 13% of patients, during treatment with PADCEV. The median time to onset to symptomatic ocular disorder was 1.6 months (range: 0 to 19.1 months). Monitor patients for ocular disorders. Consider artificial tears for prophylaxis of dry eyes and ophthalmologic evaluation if ocular symptoms occur or do not resolve. Consider treatment with ophthalmic topical steroids, if indicated after an ophthalmic exam. Consider dose interruption or dose reduction of PADCEV for symptomatic ocular disorders.Infusion site extravasation Skin and soft tissue reactions secondary to extravasation have been observed after administration of PADCEV. Of the 680 patients, 1.6% of patients experienced skin and soft tissue reactions, including 0.3% who experienced Grade 3-4 reactions. Reactions may be delayed. Erythema, swelling, increased temperature, and pain worsened until 2-7 days after extravasation and resolved within 1-4 weeks of peak. Two patients (0.3%) developed extravasation reactions with secondary cellulitis, bullae, or exfoliation. Ensure adequate venous access prior to starting PADCEV and monitor for possible extravasation during administration. If extravasation occurs, stop the infusion and monitor for adverse reactions.Embryo-fetal toxicity PADCEV can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Advise patients of the potential risk to the fetus. Advise female patients of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during PADCEV treatment and for 2 months after the last dose. Advise male patients with female partners of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with PADCEV and for 4 months after the last dose.Adverse ReactionsMost Common Adverse Reactions, Including Laboratory Abnormalities (≥20%) Rash, aspartate aminotransferase (AST) increased, glucose increased, creatinine increased, fatigue, PN, lymphocytes decreased, alopecia, decreased appetite, hemoglobin decreased, diarrhea, sodium decreased, nausea, pruritus, phosphate decreased, dysgeusia, alanine aminotransferase (ALT) increased, anemia, albumin decreased, neutrophils decreased, urate increased, lipase increased, platelets decreased, weight decreased and dry skin.EV-301 Study: 296 patients previously treated with a PD-1/L1 inhibitor and platinum-based chemotherapy. Serious adverse reactions occurred in 47% of patients treated with PADCEV; the most common (≥2%) were urinary tract infection, acute kidney injury (7% each) and pneumonia (5%).

Closely monitor patients for signs of toxicity when PADCEV is given concomitantly with dual P-gp and strong CYP3A4 inhibitors.Specific Populations Lactation Advise lactating women not to breastfeed during treatment with PADCEV and for at least 3 weeks after the last dose.Hepatic impairment Avoid the use of PADCEV in patients with moderate or severe hepatic impairment.For more information, please see the full Prescribing Information including BOXED WARNING for PADCEV here. About KEYTRUDA® (pembrolizumab) injection, 100 mgKEYTRUDA is an anti-programmed death receptor-1 (PD-1) therapy that works by increasing the ability of the body's immune system to help detect and fight tumor cells. KEYTRUDA is a humanized monoclonal antibody that blocks the interaction between PD-1 and its ligands, PD-L1 and PD-L2, thereby activating T lymphocytes which may affect both tumor cells and healthy cells.Merck has the industry's largest immuno-oncology clinical research program. There are currently more than 1,600 trials studying KEYTRUDA across a wide variety of cancers and treatment settings. The KEYTRUDA clinical program seeks to understand the role of KEYTRUDA across cancers and the factors that may predict a patient's likelihood of benefitting from treatment with KEYTRUDA, including exploring several different biomarkers.Selected KEYTRUDA® (pembrolizumab) Indications in the U.S.Urothelial CarcinomaKEYTRUDA is indicated for the treatment of patients with locally advanced or metastatic urothelial carcinoma (mUC):who are not eligible for any platinum-containing chemotherapy, orwho have disease progression during or following platinum-containing chemotherapy or within 12 months of neoadjuvant or adjuvant treatment with platinum-containing chemotherapy.Non-muscle Invasive Bladder CancerKEYTRUDA is indicated for the treatment of patients with Bacillus Calmette-Guerin-unresponsive, high-risk, non-muscle invasive bladder cancer (NMIBC) with carcinoma in situ with or without papillary tumors who are ineligible for or have elected not to undergo cystectomy.See additional selected indications for KEYTRUDA in the U.S. after the Selected Important Safety Information.Selected Important Safety Information for KEYTRUDASevere and Fatal Immune-Mediated Adverse ReactionsKEYTRUDA is a monoclonal antibody that belongs to a class of drugs that bind to either the PD-1 or the PD-L1, blocking the PD-1/PD-L1 pathway, thereby removing inhibition of the immune response, potentially breaking peripheral tolerance and inducing immune-mediated adverse reactions. Immune-mediated adverse reactions, which may be severe or fatal, can occur in any organ system or tissue, can affect more than one body system simultaneously, and can occur at any time after starting treatment or after discontinuation of treatment. Important immune-mediated adverse reactions listed here may not include all possible severe and fatal immune-mediated adverse reactions.Monitor patients closely for symptoms and signs that may be clinical manifestations of underlying immune-mediated adverse reactions. Early identification and management are essential to ensure safe use of anti–PD-1/PD-L1 treatments. Evaluate liver enzymes, creatinine, and thyroid function at baseline and periodically during treatment. For patients with TNBC treated with KEYTRUDA in the neoadjuvant setting, monitor blood cortisol at baseline, prior to surgery, and as clinically indicated. In cases of suspected immune-mediated adverse reactions, initiate appropriate workup to exclude alternative etiologies, including infection. Institute medical management promptly, including specialty consultation as appropriate.Withhold or permanently discontinue KEYTRUDA depending on severity of the immune-mediated adverse reaction. In general, if KEYTRUDA requires interruption or discontinuation, administer systemic corticosteroid therapy (1 to 2 mg/kg/day prednisone or equivalent) until improvement to Grade 1 or less. Upon improvement to Grade 1 or less, initiate corticosteroid taper and continue to taper over at least 1 month. Consider administration of other systemic immunosuppressants in patients whose adverse reactions are not controlled with corticosteroid therapy.Immune-Mediated PneumonitisKEYTRUDA can cause immune-mediated pneumonitis. The incidence is higher in patients who have received prior thoracic radiation. Immune-mediated pneumonitis occurred in 3.4% (94/2799) of patients receiving KEYTRUDA, including fatal (0.1%), Grade 4 (0.3%), Grade 3 (0.9%), and Grade 2 (1.3%) reactions. Systemic corticosteroids were required in 67% (63/94) of patients. Pneumonitis led to permanent discontinuation of KEYTRUDA in 1.3% (36) and withholding in 0.9% (26) of patients. All patients who were withheld reinitiated KEYTRUDA after symptom improvement; of these, 23% had recurrence. Pneumonitis resolved in 59% of the 94 patients.Pneumonitis occurred in 8% (31/389) of adult patients with cHL receiving KEYTRUDA as a single agent, including Grades 3-4 in 2.3% of patients. Patients received high-dose corticosteroids for a median duration of 10 days (range: 2 days to 53 months). Pneumonitis rates were similar in patients with and without prior thoracic radiation. Pneumonitis led to discontinuation of KEYTRUDA in 5.4% (21) of patients. Of the patients who developed pneumonitis, 42% interrupted KEYTRUDA, 68% discontinued KEYTRUDA, and 77% had resolution.Immune-Mediated ColitisKEYTRUDA can cause immune-mediated colitis, which may present with diarrhea. Cytomegalovirus infection/reactivation has been reported in patients with corticosteroid-refractory immune-mediated colitis. In cases of corticosteroid-refractory colitis, consider repeating infectious workup to exclude alternative etiologies. Immune-mediated colitis occurred in 1.7% (48/2799) of patients receiving KEYTRUDA, including Grade 4 (&lt;0.1%), Grade 3 (1.1%), and Grade 2 (0.4%) reactions. Systemic corticosteroids were required in 69% (33/48); additional immunosuppressant therapy was required in 4.2% of patients. Colitis led to permanent discontinuation of KEYTRUDA in 0.5% (15) and withholding in 0.5% (13) of patients. All patients who were withheld reinitiated KEYTRUDA after symptom improvement; of these, 23% had recurrence. Colitis resolved in 85% of the 48 patients.Hepatotoxicity and Immune-Mediated HepatitisKEYTRUDA as a Single AgentKEYTRUDA can cause immune-mediated hepatitis. Immune-mediated hepatitis occurred in 0.7% (19/2799) of patients receiving KEYTRUDA, including Grade 4 (&lt;0.1%), Grade 3 (0.4%), and Grade 2 (0.1%) reactions.

All patients who were withheld reinitiated KEYTRUDA after symptom improvement; of these, none had recurrence. Hepatitis resolved in 79% of the 19 patients.KEYTRUDA With AxitinibKEYTRUDA in combination with axitinib can cause hepatic toxicity. Monitor liver enzymes before initiation of and periodically throughout treatment. Consider monitoring more frequently as compared to when the drugs are administered as single agents. For elevated liver enzymes, interrupt KEYTRUDA and axitinib, and consider administering corticosteroids as needed. With the combination of KEYTRUDA and axitinib, Grades 3 and 4 increased alanine aminotransferase (ALT) (20%) and increased aspartate aminotransferase (AST) (13%) were seen at a higher frequency compared to KEYTRUDA alone. Fifty-nine percent of the patients with increased ALT received systemic corticosteroids. In patients with ALT ≥3 times upper limit of normal (ULN) (Grades 2-4, n=116), ALT resolved to Grades 0-1 in 94%. Among the 92 patients who were rechallenged with either KEYTRUDA (n=3) or axitinib (n=34) administered as a single agent or with both (n=55), recurrence of ALT ≥3 times ULN was observed in 1 patient receiving KEYTRUDA, 16 patients receiving axitinib, and 24 patients receiving both. All patients with a recurrence of ALT ≥3 ULN subsequently recovered from the event.Immune-Mediated EndocrinopathiesAdrenal InsufficiencyKEYTRUDA can cause primary or secondary adrenal insufficiency.

The reactions resolved in 79% of the 38 patients.Other Immune-Mediated Adverse ReactionsThe following clinically significant immune-mediated adverse reactions occurred at an incidence of &lt;1% (unless otherwise noted) in patients who received KEYTRUDA or were reported with the use of other anti–PD-1/PD-L1 treatments. Severe or fatal cases have been reported for some of these adverse reactions. Cardiac/Vascular: Myocarditis, pericarditis, vasculitis; Nervous System: Meningitis, encephalitis, myelitis and demyelination, myasthenic syndrome/myasthenia gravis (including exacerbation), Guillain-Barré syndrome, nerve paresis, autoimmune neuropathy; Ocular: Uveitis, iritis and other ocular inflammatory toxicities can occur. Some cases can be associated with retinal detachment. Various grades of visual impairment, including blindness, can occur. If uveitis occurs in combination with other immune-mediated adverse reactions, consider a Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada-like syndrome, as this may require treatment with systemic steroids to reduce the risk of permanent vision loss; Gastrointestinal: Pancreatitis, to include increases in serum amylase and lipase levels, gastritis, duodenitis; Musculoskeletal and Connective Tissue: Myositis/polymyositis, rhabdomyolysis (and associated sequelae, including renal failure), arthritis (1.5%), polymyalgia rheumatica; Endocrine: Hypoparathyroidism; Hematologic/Immune: Hemolytic anemia, aplastic anemia, hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis, systemic inflammatory response syndrome, histiocytic necrotizing lymphadenitis (Kikuchi lymphadenitis), sarcoidosis, immune thrombocytopenic purpura, solid organ transplant rejection.Infusion-Related ReactionsKEYTRUDA can cause severe or life-threatening infusion-related reactions, including hypersensitivity and anaphylaxis, which have been reported in 0.2% of 2799 patients receiving KEYTRUDA. Monitor for signs and symptoms of infusion-related reactions. Interrupt or slow the rate of infusion for Grade 1 or Grade 2 reactions. For Grade 3 or Grade 4 reactions, stop infusion and permanently discontinue KEYTRUDA.Complications of Allogeneic Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation (HSCT)Fatal and other serious complications can occur in patients who receive allogeneic HSCT before or after anti–PD-1/PD-L1 treatments. Transplant-related complications include hyperacute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), acute and chronic GVHD, hepatic veno-occlusive disease after reduced intensity conditioning, and steroid-requiring febrile syndrome (without an identified infectious cause). These complications may occur despite intervening therapy between anti–PD-1/PD-L1 treatment and allogeneic HSCT. Follow patients closely for evidence of these complications and intervene promptly. Consider the benefit vs risks of using anti–PD-1/PD-L1 treatments prior to or after an allogeneic HSCT.Increased Mortality in Patients With Multiple MyelomaIn trials in patients with multiple myeloma, the addition of KEYTRUDA to a thalidomide analogue plus dexamethasone resulted in increased mortality. Treatment of these patients with an anti–PD-1/PD-L1 treatment in this combination is not recommended outside of controlled trials.Embryofetal ToxicityBased on its mechanism of action, KEYTRUDA can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Advise women of this potential risk. In females of reproductive potential, verify pregnancy status prior to initiating KEYTRUDA and advise them to use effective contraception during treatment and for 4 months after the last dose.Adverse ReactionsIn KEYNOTE-006, KEYTRUDA was discontinued due to adverse reactions in 9% of 555 patients with advanced melanoma; adverse reactions leading to permanent discontinuation in more than one patient were colitis (1.4%), autoimmune hepatitis (0.7%), allergic reaction (0.4%), polyneuropathy (0.4%), and cardiac failure (0.4%).

Congress is expected to approve the legislation this week.Reuters first reported the plan on Monday. Boeing has logged more than 1,000 orders for the two new versions of its best-selling MAX. Boeing shares rose 2% on Tuesday.Some aviation unions had warned Congress in recent days that a failure to lift the deadline could threaten the new planes and cost jobs, while families of those killed in the two crashes and ""Miracle on the Hudson"" pilot Sully Sullenberger were among those opposed to it as did House Transportation Committee Chair Peter DeFazio.Cantwell's language requires retrofitting existing MAX planes with a synthetic enhanced angle-of-attack (AOA) system and the ability to shut off stall warning and overspeed alerts. It gives airline operators three years from the time the 737 MAX 10 is certified to retrofit existing MAX planes and says Boeing must bear those costs.""The safety-first alternative is much stronger than the no-strings-attached approach that was first offered. Passengers need to know that the entire MAX fleet will be uniform and safer,"" Cantwell said in a statement.Story continuesFaulty data from a single sensor erroneously activated a software function called MCAS and played critical roles in both fatal 737 MAX crashes, investigations found.The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) in 2020 required Boeing to retrofit planes to ensure MCAS would activate only if it received data from two AOA sensors. The new synthetic sensor will provide additional data to help prevent an erroneous MCAS activation, officials said.Boeing declined to comment on Monday, but Boeing Commercial Airplanes Chief Executive Stan Deal said last week the planemaker supported Cantwell's safety retrofit proposal.Without action by Congress, after Dec. 27 all planes must have modern cockpit alerting systems in order to be certified by the FAA, which could jeopardize the futures of the MAX 7 and 10 or mean significant delays for the new aircrafts’ deployment.The bill will allow the new MAX variants to have the same alerting systems as the MAX 8 and MAX 9 currently in service. The alerting requirement in the 2020 law that reformed aircraft certification does not apply to in-service MAX airplanes previously certified by the FAA.Boeing said in October it expects the 737 MAX 7 to be certified this year or in 2023, and last week Boeing's Deal said he thinks the MAX 10 could receive certification in late 2023 or early 2024.

Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: Realty Income Corp. O, Alexandria Real Estate Equities, Inc. ARE and Mid-America Apartment Communities, Inc. MAA.Here are highlights from Friday’s Analyst Blog:3 REITs with Recent Dividend Hikes to Help Survive Market VolatilityAre you planning to pour your hard-earned money into the real estate investment trust (REIT) sector, or have already invested in it? Then you must be worried about the recent 50 basis point hike in the benchmark interest rate this week by the Federal Reserve and the indication that the rates might be kept higher for an extended period of time.However, rather than worrying, a focus on the unique feature of this distinct asset class can fetch you a steady income and help to survive market volatility.In fact, with the roller coaster ride in the stock market this year — thanks to high inflation and a quick rise in interest rates that is weighing on asset prices — the focus has now shifted to investing in quality companies with a consistent track of paying dividends. Obviously, this brings us to the REITs because solid dividend payouts are arguably the biggest enticements for REIT investors.Income-seeking investors still have a large appetite for REIT stocks, as U.S. law requires REITs to distribute 90% of their annual taxable income in the form of dividends. This has enabled the industry to stand out and gain a footing over the last 15-20 years.Ushering in good news for investors, particularly income-seeking ones, recently, a number of REITs declared their dividend hikes. Among them are Realty Income Corp., Alexandria Real Estate Equities, Inc. and Mid-America Apartment Communities, Inc..Story continuesWhat's more to drive you to invest in REITs?What's more encouraging is REITs' characteristic of providing natural protection against inflation. Particularly, both rents and real estate values have a tendency to move north with prices increasing, thereby aiding dividend growth.This hybrid asset class not only provides protection against inflation but also benefits from the improving fundamentals of the underlying asset categories as well as the location of properties. In fact, with the waning of the pandemic-related concerns, REITs, which invest in all types of properties, from residential, industrial, offices and malls to hospitals, hotels, data centers and several others, are experiencing an improvement in a number of these asset categories.Also, according to the third-quarter data from the Nareit Total REIT Industry Tracker Series (T-Tracker) report, even amid a period of high inflation as well as rising rates, REITs' operational performance exhibited strength with 14.9% and 8.1% year-over-year increases in funds from operations and net operating income, respectively.As REITs continue to experience earnings growth, this special hybrid asset class remains well-positioned to deliver a decent stream of dividend income to investors.Now, if REITs' historical dependence on debt makes investors skeptical in a rising rate environment, it needs to be noted that over the years, REITs have managed their balance sheets efficiently and are now well prepared for a rising rate environment. Instead of looking for debt to finance the portfolios, these companies have strategically resorted to equity capital over the past decade.Let's discuss these REIT stocks in detail:Headquartered in San Diego, CA, Realty Income is engaged in the acquisition and management of freestanding commercial properties that reap rental revenues under long-term net lease agreements with commercial clients. This Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock has a market cap of $40.54 billion. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.This week, Realty Income announced its 118th common stock monthly dividend hike since the company's NYSE listing in 1994. Delighting its shareholders, the company will now pay out 24.85 cents per share in dividend compared with the 24.80 cents paid earlier.The increased dividend will be paid out on Jan 13 to shareholders on record as of Jan 3, 2023. The latest dividend rate marks an annualized amount of $2.982 per share compared with the prior rate of $2.976.O currently pays investors $2.98 per share, or 4.60%, on an annual basis. The company increased its dividend 24 times in the past 5 years, and its payout has grown 2.98% over the same time period. Check Realty Income's dividend history here.The latest hike reflects Realty Income's ability to generate decent cash flow through its operating platform and high-quality portfolio. It derives more than 90% of its annualized retail contractual rental revenues from tenants with a service, non-discretionary and a low-price-point component to their business.Such businesses are less susceptible to economic recessions and competition from Internet retailing and provide more reliable streams of income. Realty Income maintains high occupancy levels consistently, and its diversified tenant base, accretive buyouts and robust balance sheet bode well for its growth.Pasadena, CA-based Alexandria Real Estate Equities, Inc. is an office REIT, focusing particularly on collaborative life science, agtech and technology campuses. This Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock has a market cap of $24.68 billion.On Dec 5, Alexandria Real Estate announced a 2.5% sequential hike in its fourth-quarter 2022 cash dividend payout. Alexandria will now pay out a dividend of $1.21 per share, up from the $1.18 paid out in the third quarter. The increased dividend will be paid out on Jan 13, 2023 to shareholders on record as of Dec 30, 2022.Based on the increased rate, the annual dividend comes to $4.84 per share. For the year ending Dec 31, 2022, the common stock dividend marks an increase of 24 cents or 5% year over year.ARE currently pays investors $4.72 per share, or 3.14%, on an annual basis. The company increased its dividend 11 times in the past 5 years, and its payout has grown 6.11% over the same time period. This is attractive to income investors and represents a steady income stream. Moreover, Alexandria's current payout ratio is 57%. Check Alexandria's dividend history here.The high demand for ARE's Class A properties in AAA locations is boosting the level of occupancy and driving growth in rents. The company is witnessing strong demand for space in key life science markets.Moreover, Alexandria has adequate financial flexibility to enhance its market position and capitalize on long-term growth opportunities. Looking at the company's solid operating platform, balance sheet strength, ability to generate cash flows and payout ratio, it is likely to be able to sustain the hiked dividend.Mid-America Apartment Communities, also known as MAA and based in Germantown, TN, is engaged in owning, managing, acquiring, developing and redeveloping quality apartment communities, mainly in the Southeast, Southwest and Mid-Atlantic regions of the United States. This Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock has a market cap of $19.13 billion.On Dec 13, MAA's board of directors approved an increase in the company's quarterly dividend payment. The company will now pay out $1.40 per share, which reflects a hike of 12% from the prior dividend of $1.25.Based on the increased rate, the annual dividend comes to $5.60 per share, denoting an increase of 60 cents per share from the prior dividend level. The new dividend will be paid out on Jan 31, 2023 to shareholders of record as of Jan 13, 2023. MAA has delivered 13 years of consecutive dividend increases.MAA currently pays investors $5.00 per share, or 3.10%, on an annual basis. The company increased its dividend 7 times in the past 5 years, and its payout has grown 4.95% over the same time period. MAA's payout ratio currently sits at 62% of earnings. Check Mid-America Apartment's dividend history here.MAA's diversified Sunbelt portfolio of suburban-focused communities was less severely affected by the pandemic and the economic shutdown. The pandemic accelerated employment shifts and population inflow into the company's markets as renters sought more business-friendly, lower-taxed and low-density cities.Amid these, MAA is poised to capture recovery in demand and leasing compared with expensive coastal markets. MAA's current cash flow growth is projected at 39.17% compared with 14.86% growth projected for the industry. Looking at its lower dividend payout (compared to its industry), it seems that its dividend distribution is expected to be sustainable.Note: Anything related to earnings presented in this write-up represents funds from operations (FFO) — a widely used metric to gauge the performance of REITs.Why Haven't You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?

Excess inventory the issue looming over that report after ending Q1 up 44% in inventory from the prior year. The result, a likely hit to margins after widespread markdowns at Nike. Said Morgan Stanley, quote, ""we expect Nike likely takes advantage of potentially stronger than expected North American sportswear demand to clear through excess apparel inventory."" So they're a little bit upbeat there.Consider this note. Tail one-- one tailwind to consider-- holiday season will be impacted by the absence of Adidas branded Yeezy products, gone now after cutting ties with Kanye West in October. Also the reopening of China will certainly help them a bit. Analysts expect EPS of $0.65 revenue, 12.57 billion. Shares are down ahead of this report about 3% and down 37% this year.I think, Seana, this is really a short-term, long-term story. It looks like they're going to have to continue to work through those inventory issues, discounting, but the long run, you really got to like the equity, the brand identification and loyalty that Nike has.SEANA SMITH: Yeah, certainly. I think it's more of a longer term play because when you take into account some of the issues facing them, you mentioned inventory, supply chain, China, the weakness over there. Revenue expectations are for $1.8 billion. I think a number of analysts want to get a little bit more commentary from Nike executives just in terms of what they see playing out in China more specifically over the next quarter or two.And then, more broadly, what we're seeing here amid higher inflation and whether or not people have been starting to pull back on spending. Any early reads that we're getting of the holiday season, I think, could potentially really move this name tomorrow night.PRAS SUBRAMANIAN: And you mentioned the fact that it's such a great franchise.

There's another turn in the ongoing battle between the European Union and big tech. The bloc's executive arm escalating a probe into Meta, saying it's distorting competition in the market for classified ads. The EU says the company breached antitrust rules by unfairly tying the use of its ad service to the Facebook social network.Though only a preliminary view, Meta could face a fine of up to 10% of its annual global revenue. Last year it brought in roughly $118 billion.Following the departure of CEO Steve Rendle and a full-year forecast downgrade, VF Corp is now exploring the sale of its JanSport backpack business. That's according to a report from Bloomberg. A deal could value the company at about $500 million, though it hasn't made a final decision on pursuing a sale. VF Corp, by the way, also owns Supreme, Vans, Timberland, and North Face. Its stock is down over 60% so far this year, and it's not getting a boost from this report today.And ""Fortnite"" maker Epic Games has been fined half a billion dollars by the FTC. The agency says the video-game developer violated online privacy protections by collecting personal information from ""Fortnite"" players under the age of 13 without proper consent. The lawsuit also accuses the company of illegally enabling real-time voice and text chat communications for children. The agency adding Epic Games tricked players of all ages into making unintended purchases.Epic has not admitted or denied the FTC's allegations, but it will pay $245 million in consumer refunds to resolve the second of those complaints.

(NYSE:VFC) shareholders might want to reconsider their positions.  CEO Steve Rendle stepped down as CEO of the apparel conglomerate on Dec. 5. The move, which came as a surprise to many industry experts, suggests that the board increasingly was growing disenchanted with the company’s fundamentals, especially in North America. Rendle had been CEO for nearly six years and spent almost 25 years with the company. To step aside without a succession plan in place sounds like a leader who was pushed out rather than a traditional retirement.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsWith economic uncertainty factoring into corporate decisions, VF can’t be the only consumer discretionary name struggling. According to Yardeni Research, the S&amp;P 500 consumer discretionary sector was down 32.7% year-to-date through Dec. 12. A quick screen of consumer discretionary stocks gives me 132 names to choose from. Of those, I’ll only consider stocks down at least 20% YTD. That brings the total down to 42 names.Here are my three consumer discretionary stocks to sell heading into 2023.LYVLive Nation Entertainment$70.23SWKStanley Black &amp; Decker78.07NWLNewell Brands$13.20Live Nation Entertainment (LYV)Live Nation website displayed on smartphone hidden in jeans pocket.Source: Piotr Swat / ShutterstockLive Nation Entertainment (NYSE:LYV) is down over 40% YTD. When you combine terrible public relations from the Taylor Swift ticket-buying fiasco at its Ticketmaster subsidiary with a Department of Justice (DOJ) antitrust investigation that reportedly opened before November’s brouhaha, Live Nation shareholders might be wise to head for the exits before the Feds decide to crack down on Ticketmaster’s monopoly. It’s not a good look.Ticketmaster and Taylor Swift did say that the pre-sale for her Eras tour sold 2.4 million tickets, the most ever sold for an artist in a single day. Further, the company said that there were 90% fewer tickets sold on secondary resale websites. Story continuesAnalysts believe that a DOJ investigation won’t solve the problem of secondary markets.“From a big picture perspective, the fact that people are wanting to go see live music with this much enthusiasm should be really good for Live Nation in the long term,” stated William Blair analyst Ryan Sundby.The biggest problem is if the DOJ forces Live Nation to break apart from Ticketmaster because they’ve become completely intertwined.In Q3 2022, the company’s concert segment generated $5.29 billion in revenue, up from $2.15 billion a year earlier. While concerts accounted for 86% of its overall revenue, it relies on Ticketmaster to handle ticketing for many of its concerts. Ticketing accounted for 8.6% of its overall revenue in the third quarter. The company’s third segment is sponsorship &amp; advertising. It accounted for 5.6% of Live Nation’s overall revenue. It works with the other two segments to generate revenue. A breakup would hurt all three of the company’s operating segments. Until this issue is sorted, LYV stock will face downward pressure. I would sell before then.Stanley Black &amp; Decker (SWK)Stanley Black and Decker (SWK) is a manufacturer of industrial tools and household hardware and provider of security productsSource: ricochet64 / Shutterstock.comMy wife’s business partner’s favorite power tool brand is DeWalt, which has been owned by Black &amp; Decker since 1960 when it acquired the company from AMF, a conglomerate of the times.In November 2009, Black &amp; Decker was acquired by Stanley Works for $4.5 billion, and the global tool company following the merger was called Stanley Black &amp; Decker (NYSE:SWK). The all-stock deal saw Stanley shareholders owning 50.5% of the combined company, with Black &amp; Decker’s shareholders owning 49.5%.In the 12 years since, SWK stock has gained just 36%. Over the same period, the index is up 233%, a more than four-fold gain. Value investors will point to the fact that SWK has fallen 63% from its May 2021 all-time high of $225, suggesting the company’s stock is severely oversold. Dividend investors will argue that this dividend king — any stock that has increased its dividend for 50 consecutive years or more — has an exceptional 3.9% yield, higher than it’s been since the financial crisis.   The problem with yield chasing is that it doesn’t fix the main issue with Stanley Black &amp; Decker, which is that its margins are terrible. In the trailing 12 months ended Oct. 1, its gross and operating margins were 27.55% and 5.12%, considerably lower than their five-year averages of 33.90% and 10.43%, respectively.SWK stock is cheap because its business is a mess. Of 19 analysts covering the company, 15 rate it as hold or worse, a sign that Wall Street isn’t convinced the company can fix what ails it. The median target price of $81 is above where it’s currently trading. This is not a stock I’d want to own heading into a possible recession. Newell Brands (NWL)A photo of a sign showing the Newell Brands (NWL) logo outside a building.Source: JHVEPhoto/Shutterstock.comOn two occasions in Newell Brands’ (NASDAQ:NWL) long and sometimes illustrious history, NWL stock has traded higher than $50. The first time was in 1998-1999. The second was in 2016-2017, not too long after announcing their purchase of Jarden in late 2015.It’s been a miserable time for long-term, buy-and-hold shareholders. It did make a brief recovery midway through 2021, but it’s down 51% since. In early December, I suggested that the company still had too many brands on its roster, and that a new CEO is a must if it is to recover from the depths it currently finds itself. In 2022, through the first nine months of the fiscal year, Newell’s sales are down 7.8%, while its operating income is off nearly 27%. The situation in the third quarter has accelerated its woes, with revenue and operating income falling 19.2% and 87.5%, respectively.Worse still, it’s burning through cash. Through the first nine months of 2021, Newell had positive cash flow of $490 million. In 2022, its cash flow is -$567 million through the end of the third quarter. This is nearly $1.1 billion worse than a year ago. So, to solve some of its operational deficiencies, it hired a new CFO. His name is Mark Erceg, and he served as CFO for at least four public companies in his 30-year business career. The man relishes a challenge. The argument for a conglomerate-style business such as Newell has always been that its heft of brands gives it more sway with the Walmarts (NYSE:WMT) and Targets (NYSE:TGT) of the world. However, the truth is that these discount retailers would gladly deal with a standalone Rubbermaid business if that’s what the customers wanted. A quick look at Newell’s 10-Q suggests that one or both of its commercial solutions (Rubbermaid) and learning and development (Sharpie, Papermate, EXPO) segments ought to be spun out into their own independent public companies. You can own Conglomerate A (Berkshire Hathaway) (NYSE:BRK-A, NYSE:BRK-B) or Conglomerate B (Newell Brands).I know which one I’d own.On the date of publication, Will Ashworth did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

The company's market valuation decreased by US$6.4b after the stock price dropped 3.9% over the past week, but insiders were spared from painful losses.While we would never suggest that investors should base their decisions solely on what the directors of a company have been doing, we do think it is perfectly logical to keep tabs on what insiders are doing. See our latest analysis for Wells Fargo Wells Fargo Insider Transactions Over The Last YearOver the last year, we can see that the biggest insider sale was by the insider, Kleber Santos, for US$1.0m worth of shares, at about US$44.44 per share. That means that an insider was selling shares at around the current price of US$41.19. While insider selling is a negative, to us, it is more negative if the shares are sold at a lower price. In this case, the big sale took place at around the current price, so it's not too bad (but it's still not a positive). Kleber Santos was the only individual insider to sell shares in the last twelve months.The chart below shows insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last year. By clicking on the graph below, you can see the precise details of each insider transaction!insider-trading-volumeIf you are like me, then you will not want to miss this free list of growing companies that insiders are buying.Insider Ownership Of Wells FargoLooking at the total insider shareholdings in a company can help to inform your view of whether they are well aligned with common shareholders. Usually, the higher the insider ownership, the more likely it is that insiders will be incentivised to build the company for the long term. Insiders own 0.06% of Wells Fargo shares, worth about US$91m. While this is a strong but not outstanding level of insider ownership, it's enough to indicate some alignment between management and smaller shareholders.Story continuesSo What Does This Data Suggest About Wells Fargo Insiders?It doesn't really mean much that no insider has traded Wells Fargo shares in the last quarter. Our analysis of Wells Fargo insider transactions leaves us cautious. But we do like the fact that insiders own a fair chunk of the company. While we like knowing what's going on with the insider's ownership and transactions, we make sure to also consider what risks are facing a stock before making any investment decision.

STYAX has a Zacks Mutual Fund Rank of 2 (Buy), which is based on nine forecasting factors like size, cost, and past performance.History of Fund/ManagerAllspring is based in San Francisco, CA, and is the manager of STYAX. Since Wells Fargo Core Plus Bond A made its debut in July of 1998, STYAX has garnered more than $239.08 million in assets. A team of investment professionals is the fund's current manager.PerformanceObviously, what investors are looking for in these funds is strong performance relative to their peers. STYAX has a 5-year annualized total return of 0.9% and it sits in the top third among its category peers. Investors who prefer analyzing shorter time frames should look at its 3-year annualized total return of -1.28%, which places it in the top third during this time-frame.When looking at a fund's performance, it is also important to note the standard deviation of the returns. The lower the standard deviation, the less volatility the fund experiences. The standard deviation of STYAX over the past three years is 6.74% compared to the category average of 14.59%. Looking at the past 5 years, the fund's standard deviation is 5.55% compared to the category average of 12.75%. This makes the fund less volatile than its peers over the past half-decade.With a beta of 0.87, this fund is less volatile than a broad market index of fixed income securities. Taking this into account, STYAX has a positive alpha of 0.74, which measures performance on a risk-adjusted basis.RatingsInvestors should also consider a bond's rating, which is a grade ( 'AAA' to 'D' ) given to a bond that indicates its credit quality. With this letter scale in mind, STYAX has 57.43% in high quality bonds rated at least 'AA' or higher, while 29.3% are of medium quality, with ratings of 'A' to 'BBB'. The fund has an average quality of AA, and focuses on high quality securities.Story continuesExpensesAs competition heats up in the mutual fund market, costs become increasingly important.

Many of those elements appear to be lacking in China, they say.President Xi Jinping has long insisted that the country's one party-system is best suited to handle the disease, and that Chinese vaccines are superior to western counterparts, despite some evidence to the contrary.Democratic governments find themselves in a difficult spot diplomatically, wanting to help stem a burgeoning crisis with global and domestic health and economic implications in a way that the Chinese government might be willing to accept.""China's vaccine nationalism is deeply tied to Xi's pride, and accepting Western assistance would not only embarrass Xi, it would also pierce his oft-propagandized narrative that China's governance model is superior,"" said Craig Singleton, deputy director of the China program at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies.European and U.S. officials are conducting careful behind-the scenes talks with Chinese counterparts, while issuing deliberately worded public statements intended to make clear that the ball is in Beijing's court.Story continuesWashington and Beijing officials discussed how to handle COVID earlier this month in talks in China to prepare for Secretary of State Antony Blinken's visit early next year, U.S. national security adviser Jake Sullivan said last week. He refused to give details, citing ""sensitive diplomatic channels.""One area of potential Western assistance involves whether China would accept BioNTech's updated mRNA vaccine designed to target currently circulating Omicron-related virus variants, which many experts believe is more effective than China's shots.German chancellor Olaf Scholz discussed the issue in a visit to Beijing last month along with BioNTech Chief Executive Ugur Sahin.However, the United States and other Western countries are not openly encouraging China to accept Western-made mRNA vaccines, White House coronavirus response coordinator Dr. Ashish Jha told reporters on Thursday. ""We stand ready to help any country in the world with vaccines, treatments, anything else that we can be helpful with,"" he said.Beijing has said ""institutional advantages"" will help it get through the epidemic without foreign assistance, and China's estimated COVID death toll is still lower than the 1.1 million U.S. deaths and Europe's 2.1 million.But U.S. drugmaker Pfizer last week reached an agreement to export its COVID antiviral treatment Paxlovid to China through a local company, saying it was working with all stakeholders to secure adequate supply.""Whether China asks or not, as a citizen of Beijing, I welcome the attitude of the US government,"" Hu Xijin, former editor of party tabloid the Global Times, said on Twitter, adding that he hopes the U.S. government will push Pfizer to lower Paxlovid's price.'RISKY SITUATION'The rivalry between the United States and China, the world's two largest economies, has intensified in recent months, with the Biden administration trying to kneecap China's semiconductor sector and elbow Beijing out politically in Asia and Africa.President Joe Biden has described the state of global politics as an inflection point between democracy and autocracies.But the two countries remain deeply intertwined, with China the largest U.S. trade partner and top customer for many American companies.""We want China to get COVID right,"" Blinken said earlier this month. ""It’s in the interests of the Chinese people first and foremost, but it’s also in the interests of people around the world.""China-exposed luxury firms such as France-based LVMH and industrial indices have traded down recently on COVID concerns, and Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell signaled his worries last week.“China faces a very challenging system in reopening,” Powell said, adding that its manufacturing, exporting and supply chain remain critical. ""It’s a risky situation.""Health experts outside China despair that it may be too late to stave off a tragedy.""What do you do for a Category 5 hurricane when it's an hour and a half offshore? If you haven't done it by now, it's too late,"" said Michael Osterholm, director of the Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy at the University of Minnesota.""This pandemic is just going to blow through (China) in the next weeks,"" he said. “It's unfortunate they didn't think about this six or 10 months ago. They could have bought themselves time to be in a better position.”More than 160 million people in China are believed to have diabetes, and there are eight million unvaccinated Chinese over age 80, Yanzhong Huang, a senior fellow for global health at the Council on Foreign Relations said. Those are risk factors for severe COVID.South Korea, which has one of the lowest COVID mortality rates of any large country, managed the pandemic by vaccinating as many people as possible, shoring up hospitals before reopening, and communicating with the public about the disease, said Dr. Jerome Kim, director general of the Seoul-based International Vaccine Institute.Officials set up health centers and apps that told people with symptoms how to avoid infecting others, he said.""Is that set up in China now? We don’t know.""(Reporting by Trevor Hunnicutt in Washington, Julie Steenhuysen in Chicago and Andreas Rinke in Berlin; Additional reporting by Marisa Taylor, Hyunsu Yim, Jeff Mason and Michael Martina; Writing by Heather Timmons; Editing by Bill Berkrot)]"

The non-insurance businesses are delivering improved results with increased revenues over the past few years. A sturdy capital level provides further impetus.However, exposure to catastrophe loss induces earnings volatility and also affects the property and casualty underwriting results of Berkshire. Huge capital expenditure remains a headwind for the company.(You can read the full research report on Berkshire Hathaway here &gt;&gt;&gt;)Exxon Mobil shares have outperformed the Zacks Oil and Gas - Integrated - International industry over the past year (+77.0% vs. +46.8%).

The company is facing currency headwinds and pricing pressure that are key top-line headwinds. Although no company is as strongly placed in the COVID vaccines/treatment market as Pfizer, concerns remain about its long-term growth drivers beyond its COVID-related products due to competitive pressure and the impact of the pandemic receding.Nevertheless, Pfizer boasts a diversified portfolio of innovative drugs and vaccines, including Ibrance and Prevnar. Its COVID-19 vaccine has become a key contributor to the top line.

Both bivalent vaccines are currently authorized for adults and adolescents aged 12 years and older.The latest CHMP recommendation is supported by data based on clinical studies which evaluated a third/booster dose of Spikevax in participants aged between six through 11 years who already had completed a primary series of Moderna’s COVID vaccine. The recommendation is also based on data from a phase II/III study that evaluated mRNA-1273.214 in adults aged 18 years and older. Last month, management announced that this phase II/III study achieved its primary endpoint of generating a superior antibody response in study participants compared with the booster dose of Spikevax. The bivalent vaccine also met non-inferiority immunogenicity criteria to the original strain.Moderna is also advancing a phase II/III study evaluating mRNA-1273.214 as booster and primary series in children six months through five years. Initial data from the study are expected in early 2023.Shares of Moderna have declined 23.9% so far this year compared with the industry’s 19.7% fall.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchThe bivalent vaccine contains an mRNA encoding the spike protein in the original/monovalent vaccine and an mRNA encoding the spike protein common in the Omicron variants. While mRNA-1273.222 contains the spike protein in the BA.4/5 Omicron subvariants, mRNA-1273.214 contains the spike protein in the BA.1 Omicron subvariant.Story continuesModerna faces stiff competition from Pfizer PFE/BioNTech BNTX, who also market their bivalent COVID-19 vaccines in the European Union. Pfizer/BioNTech currently markets two COVID-19 bivalent vaccines — one targeting the BA.1 subvariant and another targeting the BA.4/5 subvariant. While Pfizer/BioNTech’s BA.1 targeting bivalent vaccine is authorized for use in individuals aged 12 years and older, their BA.4/5 vaccine is authorized for use in people aged five years and older.In the United States, Moderna and Pfizer/BioNTech’s respective bivalent Omicron BA.4/5-targeting COVID vaccines are authorized for use in individuals aged six months and older.Moderna, Inc.

So, it might be a good idea to review some of the factors that might affect the near-term performance of the stock.Over the past month, shares of this technology platform and digital payments company have returned -18.4%, compared to the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's -2.7% change. During this period, the Zacks Internet - Software industry, which Paypal falls in, has lost 2.8%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?Although media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.Revisions to Earnings EstimatesRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.We essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.Paypal is expected to post earnings of $1.19 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +7.2%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -0.3%.For the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $4.08 points to a change of -11.3% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has changed +1%.For the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $4.79 indicates a change of +17.3% from what Paypal is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed +0.2%.Story continuesWith an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for Paypal.The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPS12-month consensus EPS estimate for PYPL _12MonthEPSChartUrlRevenue Growth ForecastEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.For Paypal, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $7.39 billion indicates a year-over-year change of +6.8%. For the current and next fiscal years, $27.52 billion and $29.88 billion estimates indicate +8.5% and +8.6% changes, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryPaypal reported revenues of $6.85 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +10.7%. EPS of $1.08 for the same period compares with $1.11 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $6.82 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +0.4%. The EPS surprise was +13.68%.Over the last four quarters, Paypal surpassed consensus EPS estimates two times. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.ValuationNo investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.Comparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.As part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.Paypal is graded B on this front, indicating that it is trading at a discount to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.ConclusionThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Paypal. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

The company's stock saw a double-digit share price rise of over 10% in the past couple of months on the NYSE. As a large-cap stock with high coverage by analysts, you could assume any recent changes in the company’s outlook is already priced into the stock. However, could the stock still be trading at a relatively cheap price? Let’s examine International Business Machines’s valuation and outlook in more detail to determine if there’s still a bargain opportunity. View our latest analysis for International Business Machines Is International Business Machines Still Cheap?Great news for investors – International Business Machines is still trading at a fairly cheap price. According to my valuation, the intrinsic value for the stock is $217.75, but it is currently trading at US$139 on the share market, meaning that there is still an opportunity to buy now. What’s more interesting is that, International Business Machines’s share price is theoretically quite stable, which could mean two things: firstly, it may take the share price a while to move to its intrinsic value, and secondly, there may be less chances to buy low in the future once it reaches that value. This is because the stock is less volatile than the wider market given its low beta.Can we expect growth from International Business Machines?earnings-and-revenue-growthFuture outlook is an important aspect when you’re looking at buying a stock, especially if you are an investor looking for growth in your portfolio. Although value investors would argue that it’s the intrinsic value relative to the price that matter the most, a more compelling investment thesis would be high growth potential at a cheap price. International Business Machines' earnings over the next few years are expected to double, indicating a very optimistic future ahead. This should lead to stronger cash flows, feeding into a higher share value.Story continuesWhat This Means For YouAre you a shareholder? Since IBM is currently undervalued, it may be a great time to increase your holdings in the stock. With a positive outlook on the horizon, it seems like this growth has not yet been fully factored into the share price. However, there are also other factors such as capital structure to consider, which could explain the current undervaluation.Are you a potential investor? If you’ve been keeping an eye on IBM for a while, now might be the time to enter the stock. Its prosperous future outlook isn’t fully reflected in the current share price yet, which means it’s not too late to buy IBM. But before you make any investment decisions, consider other factors such as the track record of its management team, in order to make a well-informed investment decision.With this in mind, we wouldn't consider investing in a stock unless we had a thorough understanding of the risks.

This move lagged the S&amp;P 500's daily loss of 0.9%. At the same time, the Dow lost 0.5%, and the tech-heavy Nasdaq lost 0.27%.Prior to today's trading, shares of the technology and consulting company had lost 5.07% over the past month. This has lagged the Computer and Technology sector's loss of 4.11% and the S&amp;P 500's loss of 2.66% in that time.IBM will be looking to display strength as it nears its next earnings release. On that day, IBM is projected to report earnings of $3.57 per share, which would represent year-over-year growth of 6.57%. Meanwhile, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenue is projecting net sales of $15.49 billion, down 7.24% from the year-ago period.IBM's full-year Zacks Consensus Estimates are calling for earnings of $9.12 per share and revenue of $59.32 billion. These results would represent year-over-year changes of +15.01% and -16.2%, respectively.It is also important to note the recent changes to analyst estimates for IBM. These revisions help to show the ever-changing nature of near-term business trends. With this in mind, we can consider positive estimate revisions a sign of optimism about the company's business outlook.Based on our research, we believe these estimate revisions are directly related to near-team stock moves. To benefit from this, we have developed the Zacks Rank, a proprietary model which takes these estimate changes into account and provides an actionable rating system.The Zacks Rank system, which ranges from #1 (Strong Buy) to #5 (Strong Sell), has an impressive outside-audited track record of outperformance, with #1 stocks generating an average annual return of +25% since 1988. The Zacks Consensus EPS estimate remained stagnant within the past month. IBM currently has a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold).Digging into valuation, IBM currently has a Forward P/E ratio of 15.37. Its industry sports an average Forward P/E of 15.37, so we one might conclude that IBM is trading at a no noticeable deviation comparatively.Story continuesInvestors should also note that IBM has a PEG ratio of 2.31 right now. The PEG ratio is similar to the widely-used P/E ratio, but this metric also takes the company's expected earnings growth rate into account. The Computer - Integrated Systems industry currently had an average PEG ratio of 1.78 as of yesterday's close.The Computer - Integrated Systems industry is part of the Computer and Technology sector. This group has a Zacks Industry Rank of 206, putting it in the bottom 19% of all 250+ industries.The Zacks Industry Rank gauges the strength of our individual industry groups by measuring the average Zacks Rank of the individual stocks within the groups.

Here at IBM, our focus continues to be how we turn ambition into action-in sustainability, ESG and beyond.Over the next year, we expect to see businesses across the globe advance important sustainability policies and practices. In fact, according to a recent Morning Consult poll commissioned by IBM, 61% of global business leaders said that their business will be investing in sustainability programs and initiatives to meet their ESG goals in the next 12 months. Interestingly, the poll also found that among the top sustainability investments planned are energy-efficient computing and IT, with 30% of companies planning to invest in green IT solutions.As companies increase investments and strengthen their sustainability practices in an effort to transform their operations, they are wise to harness the power of technology to meet their ESG goals efficiently and make a profound impact on our planet.That's exactly what we aim to do at IBM. Through groundbreaking technology, including hybrid cloud and AI, IBM is not only supporting global companies in building successful ESG programs but is also consistently reaching its own ESG goals by investing in critical sustainability initiatives. Here are some examples:IBM Sustainability AcceleratorThis year IBM launched its Sustainability Accelerator, a pro bono social impact program that applies IBM technologies, such as hybrid cloud and AI, and an ecosystem of experts to enhance and scale non-profit and government organization interventions, helping populations vulnerable to environmental threats including climate change, extreme weather, and pollution. With the launch, the company announced the first group of partners to work on sustainable agriculture, including Plan 21 Foundation, The Nature Conservancy India, Heifer International, Texas A&amp;M AgriLife and Deltares.Story continuesThe second cohort of the IBM Sustainability Accelerator was announced during COP27, with five organizations focused on clean energy projects selected to receive end-to-end support and a technical roadmap to scale long-term impacts and drive key societal outcomes. The local and regional organizations selected were the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), Sustainable Energy for All, the Miyakojima City Government, the Environment Without Borders Foundation and Net Zero Atlantic.IBM will work closely with the organizations to use sustainability technology to effectively scale positive climate outcomes.Tech Solutions for SustainabilityThis fall, IBM Global Real Estate won multiple awards for its cutting-edge sustainability initiatives, which included using sustainability software to embed insights into daily operating decisions for more sustainable facilities management. IBM reduced its carbon emissions by nearly 62% from 2010 to 2011 and reduced sustainability reporting costs by 30% by replacing multiple tools with a single, automated platform.As a big global company, IBM has over 50 million square feet of space under management in 100 countries, so increasing the sustainability efficiency of those facilities is crucial to meet our commitments, including achieving Net Zero GHG Emissions by 2030 and diverting 90% of nonhazardous waste (by weight) from landfill and incineration by 2025.These are just some examples of IBM harnessing the power of data and good tech to make a lasting, positive impact in the communities where we work and live.A Shifting CultureThrough powerful data and tech, businesses are developing robust sustainability initiatives to meet their ESG goals and strengthen supply chain operations, saving money and reducing carbon emissions in the process.IBM believes that having strong ESG principles and practices, including working towards sustainability goals, is good for business as well as the planet. Business leaders are paying attention to this, and IBM aspires to lead the way.View additional multimedia and more ESG storytelling from IBM on 3blmedia.com.Contact Info:Spokesperson: IBMWebsite: profiles/ibmEmail: info@3blmedia.comSOURCE: IBMView source version on accesswire.com: https://www.accesswire.com/732355/2023-Look-Ahead-ESG-Policies-Are-Good-Not-Just-for-the-Planet-but-for-Business]"

Just ahead of the holidays, investors are in for a hectic economic and earnings lineup, actually, in the week ahead. We've got PCE on deck and earnings from Nike, FedEx, Micron, and General Mills to consider as well. On the economic front, obviously, that PCE number, which comes out later in the week, is the one that the Fed does watch most closely. You know, and that's going to be the personal consumptions expenditures deflator.BRAD SMITH: No, no, no, no.JULIE HYMAN: You know, we are-- listen, it's probably going to confirm what we've been seeing already, that there is going to be a slowdown in the increase of inflation, slowdown in the rate of inflation. But still, that's something that the market is going to be cuing in on, even as we're likely to have a relatively low volume week because people are just kind of sewing up their portfolios on the year and getting away for the holidays.BRIAN SOZZI: Yeah, I love that calendar we're showing of things coming up. Nike, that'll actually be my take, a little preview a little later on in the show. Some concerns on how that quarter shook out. General Mills, a lot of the results, earnings results from the food players, like Campbell's Soup, have been very strong, have pushed through price increases. General Mills might also echo that as well.FedEx, we've been talking about FedEx a lot the past six months. They've put up a series of real dud type quarters and outlooks. It's proving time for them. Also will give a great read into how the holiday season has been shaping up. Good to hear from FedEx, Micron. They've been warning the past two quarters as well, chip supply considerations.The wild card here might be a Rite Aid. They have not been performing well, but this flu season has been absolutely awful. And I have seen all of these. CVS, Rite Aid, Walgreens, these stores have been absolutely packed from people going in there and getting these flu shots.Story continuesBRAD SMITH: Yeah, I'll just follow up on two of those, FedEx primarily. The reduction in forecasts that they had noted at the end of last quarter for air freight and ground shipping, that caught a lot of investors' attention. So we'll see if they can bounce back from what was a dud, as I believe you mentioned.BRIAN SOZZI: Dud, dud, a zero.BRAD SMITH: A zero.BRIAN SOZZI: An egg.BRAD SMITH: And then Nike as well.BRIAN SOZZI: A nothing.BRAD SMITH: Just--JULIE HYMAN: [LAUGHS]BRAD SMITH: I was looking at some web traffic results as well for Nike. Web traffic has decreased month over month, and particularly for the most recent month that we have results for, which is November. So depending upon how December shapes out and some of the big drops, the big releases, and that expected to drive even more of the fanfare of the traffic that is cyclical year over year for Nike, we'll see how that shakes out for this-- actually, well-- actually, it won't be in this quarter's results because we're current month, so.BRIAN SOZZI: Oh, cool. I mean, yeah, I wasn't impressed by anything by Nike. I was at the mall this weekend, just nothing really, like, mm, I need this. I need this in my life.BRAD SMITH: Well, most of the impressive stuff has already dropped on the sneakers app. It's unavailable. You can't get it. You had to beat the bots. You weren't able to do that. Or if it did make it into store, you had to stand in line to go get it. And I know where you're at most Mondays through Fridays, so.BRIAN SOZZI: No time for that.BRAD SMITH: Yeah, exactly.JULIE HYMAN: Yeah, definitely not prioritizing the drops these days. I'm also going to be watching Micron this week, by the way-- that's another one that's out-- just as another measure of where we are in this chip cycle. We know that things are not good within the chip industry. And if you look at the company's forecast for the first quarter, its fiscal first quarter, its forecast is above where most analysts are at this point. So expectations are pretty low. And this will be a good barometer as to what's going on in that industry.BRAD SMITH: All right, time to keep an eye on this week here and some light volume here that we're expecting, too.]"

The company’s diversified business has also been a driver. The impact of these upsides was visible in the company’s first-quarter fiscal 2023 results, wherein the top and bottom lines grew year over year and the former came ahead of the Zacks Consensus Estimate.The company saw a double-digit rise in earnings and sales as it efficiently managed inflation and witnessed a case volume increase and higher market share. On its first-quarter earnings call, management stated that it remains optimistic about its business while remaining cautious of the macroeconomic landscape.Factors Backing SyscoSysco has been focused on its Recipe for Growth, which is strengthening the company’s capacities across sales and the supply chain. The program involves five strategic priorities aimed at enabling SYY to grow 1.5 times faster than the market by FY24 end. The five strategic pillars include enhancing customers’ experience via digital tools. In this regard, the company’s Sysco Shop platform and the new pricing software are working well.Further, Sysco is focused on improving the supply chain to cater to customers efficiently and consistently with better delivery and omnichannel inventory management. Next, Sysco aims at providing customer-oriented merchandising and marketing solutions to augment sales.The company also targets team-based selling, with an emphasis on important cuisines. Finally, Sysco is focused on cultivating new capacities, channels and segments alongside sponsoring investments via cost-saving initiatives.Sysco Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS SurpriseSysco Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS SurpriseSysco Corporation price-consensus-eps-surprise-chart | Sysco Corporation QuoteSysco is a diversified company, which covers every part of the food away from home market. The company’s operations are diversified across different customer types, product categories and geographies.Sysco caters to restaurants of all price-point spectrums and types. It also caters to health care and education facilities, alongside travel and recreation facilities in office buildings. Travel and recreation facilities are seeing a continued revival and are likely to be a growth area in the coming years.Moreover, Sysco has been carrying out various acquisitions over the years to grow its distribution network and customer base and boost long-term growth. In February 2022, the company concluded the acquisition of The Coastal Companies, which operates under Sysco’s specialty produce business – FreshPoint. Before this, SYY acquired Greco and Sons in the first quarter of fiscal 2022. We note that these acquisitions go in tandem with Sysco’s Recipe for Growth.Story continuesCost Woes PersistSysco has been encountering product cost inflation in the U.S. Foodservice unit for a while now. In the first quarter of fiscal 2023, the company witnessed product cost inflation of 9.7%, which was measured by estimated changes in product costs, mainly in the dairy and frozen categories. The U.S. Broadline saw 12% product cost inflation, which was measured by estimated changes in product costs, mainly in the dairy and frozen categories. The persistence of such trends poses threats to margins.For fiscal 2023, management earlier projected inflation in the mid-single digits across all categories. Sysco also expects increased operating costs in the fiscal year due to transformation investments and a tough hiring landscape.The Bottom LineWe believe that the abovementioned upsides are likely to help Sysco tide over cost hurdles. On its last earnings call, management reiterated its adjusted earnings per share guidance range of $4.09-$4.39 for fiscal 2023, suggesting 26-35% growth from the year-ago period. Sysco remains on track to grow more than 1.35 times the market in fiscal 2023.Shares of this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company have dipped 1.1% in the past three months against the industry’s growth of 8.6%.Looking for Consumer Staple Stocks?

Air travel is exceptionally busy around the world this week due to the winter holidays.The Hawaiian Airlines flight departed Phoenix and was nearing Honolulu around 10:35 a.m. HST (2035 GMT) on Sunday when it hit the turbulence, according to the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA).On Monday, the U.S. National Transportation Safety Board announced it would investigate the incident.Hawaiian Airlines said in a statement on Monday that 36 people had been evaluated at the airport upon landing, and that it was ""continuing to support"" the 17 passengers and three crewmembers who were transported to area hospitals for treatment, 11 with serious injuries.Meanwhile, two passengers and three crewmembers on a United Airlines flight from Rio de Janeiro were injured early on Monday by turbulence en route to Houston, Texas.

So there's the opening bell here on this Monday morning with the holidays upon us. Hanukkah began last night. Happy Hanukkah--BRIAN SOZZI: Thank you.JULIE HYMAN: --to everyone who celebrates.BRIAN SOZZI: You as well. I'm looking at MasterBrand. It looks like a brand that I may want to shop. Hopefully, it's a retail brand.BRAD SMITH: What?JULIE HYMAN: OK.BRIAN SOZZI: Cabinets? Cabinets?JULIE HYMAN: I don't know.BRIAN SOZZI: Cabinets. Yeah, cabinets.JULIE HYMAN: OK, MasterBrand cabinets. Are you in the market for new-- you have a-- you have a nice kitchen.BRIAN SOZZI: I do, I mean, they've been around for seven years. Good for them getting some play on the New York Stock Exchange.JULIE HYMAN: Good for them, indeed. All right, Brad is checking out what's going on the YFi Interactive over there Brad, you doing OK there as we get underway this morning?BRAD SMITH: I was just waiting for some things to calibrate so that we could put together a full view of what's going on for our viewers here. So taking a look at the Dow, out the gate, flat but barely to the upside here.Let's take a look at the year-to-date. How about that, because we're gonna be entering into some low volume periods as traders get some of the vacation. Of course, that could lead to some volatility, some volatile swings. Not here today. We're just kind of muddling along here. Flat to the downside now for the Dow Jones Industrial Average. So you've got the early makings of a waffle activity there.And then additionally here checking in on the NASDAQ Composite. Let's take a look at that major average for the tech-heavy average. You're seeing that flat just barely to the downside as well. S&amp;P 500, same case there. I sound like a broken record.Story continuesBut let's check in on some of the sectors. Perhaps we got some interesting activity playing out there. As of right now, you've got more laggards than advancers. Really, just energy. Energy, and now you've got some entrance into that party, the positive gains party, with materials flat barely to the upside.And financials deciding to get in on the chat, too. So and you're seeing communication services actually move lower by about 7/10 of percent. Bringing up the caboose here, we're gonna break down some deal activity that's taking place in that sector in just a hot second.And then lastly here, I did want to take a look at some of the travel names, as we've seen for TSA Travel throughput numbers, I noted down that we had seen 2.35 million people travel over this week-- or over this weekend-- yesterday, actually, to really kick off some of that holiday travel.And so keep a close eye on some of the airline names. You have also got a deal between the United airlines and Mesa Airlines for regional flights. That as they move away from their previous partner, which was American Airlines. And so American Airlines, you're seeing them actually fractionally higher right now by about 3/10 of a percent. While United Airlines is up by about 6/10 of a percent.So we'll keep a close eye on everything from the booking names all the way into the hotel, the travel and accommodation space. Going to be interesting to watch over the course of this week as we see even more of those throughput numbers given-- giving us some kind of real time-- real-time insight into how people are moving about the country this holiday season.JULIE HYMAN: Yeah, we always have our [INAUDIBLE] data as well.

Of course, one figure often stands out among the rest: earnings.The earnings figure itself is key, but a beat or miss on the bottom line can sometimes be just as, if not more, important. Therefore, investors should consider paying close attention to these earnings surprises, as a big beat can help a stock climb even higher.2 Stocks to Add to Your WatchlistThe Zacks Earnings ESP is more formally known as the Expected Surprise Prediction, and it aims to grab the inside track on the latest analyst estimate revisions ahead of a company's report. The idea is relatively intuitive as a newer projection might be based on more complete information. The ESP is calculated by comparing the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate, with the percentage difference between the two giving us the Zacks ESP figure.The final step today is to look at a stock that meets our ESP qualifications. United Airlines (UAL) earns a Zacks Rank #2 30 days from its next quarterly earnings release on January 18, 2023, and its Most Accurate Estimate comes in at $2.16 a share.United Airlines' Earnings ESP sits at 1.57%, which, as explained above, is calculated by taking the percentage difference between the $2.16 Most Accurate Estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.13.UAL is part of a big group of Transportation stocks that boast a positive ESP, and investors may want to take a look at Alaska Air Group (ALK) as well.Alaska Air Group, which is readying to report earnings on January 26, 2023, sits at a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) right now. It's Most Accurate Estimate is currently $0.94 a share, and ALK is 38 days out from its next earnings report.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Alaska Air Group is $0.94, and when you take the percentage difference between that number and its Most Accurate Estimate, you get the Earnings ESP figure of 0.49%.Story continuesUAL and ALK's positive ESP figures tell us that both stocks have a good chance at beating analyst expectations in their next earnings report.Find Stocks to Buy or Sell Before They're ReportedUse the Zacks Earnings ESP Filter to turn up stocks with the highest probability of positively, or negatively, surprising to buy or sell before they're reported for profitable earnings season trading.

One of the principal ways that many companies choose to accomplish these goals - whether in the real estate industry or not - is through strategic, sustainable finance efforts.PNC Bank client, NETSTREIT, specializes in acquiring single-tenant net lease retail properties and recently made the decision to double down on its sustainability commitments by setting aggressive goals that go further than any of its current competitors.Commitment to SustainabilityThe Dallas-based company, whose tenants include national discount retail, auto parts, pharmacy, grocery stores and convenience store chains, already had a fairly robust corporate ESG strategy leading up to and following its initial public offering but realized there was room to make more of an impact.""As a young company, we wanted to be intentional with our ESG goals. We have done well with the social and governance aspects, but we had been trying to figure out what more we could do in the environmental space,"" says Andy Blocher, NETSTREIT's chief financial officer and treasurer. ""We can pretend that carbon emissions aren't having an impact on our way of life, but problems do exist, and it should be important for companies to address them.""As with most real estate investment trusts (REITs), NETSTREIT's corporate footprint is rather small, consisting of its headquarters location that already had been renovated and optimized from a sustainability perspective in 2016. The location received a LEED Gold certification for operations and management and achieved an Energy Star rating. The company also addressed the carbon footprint of its employees by providing walkable options with close proximity to public transportation. Additionally, NETSTREIT installed a rooftop beehive this year to help preserve bee habitats.Story continues""Previously we felt optimizing our headquarters was the largest opportunity that we had from a sustainability perspective,"" Blocher says. ""But we realized that our headquarters actually represents a very small portion of our overall environmental impact, including our portfolio emissions, and there was an opportunity to create a larger impact.""When NETSTREIT recently decided to recast its credit facility, it saw the opportunity to take action and make a bigger environmental difference through its tenants. As part of its recent closing of a $600 million sustainability-linked senior unsecured credit facility that includes term and revolving loans, the company also announced its efforts to identify opportunities to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.PNC helped the company not only structure the upsized financing as administrative agent and lead arranger, but also helped NETSTREIT create metrics that incentivize the company to evaluate the carbon footprints of its tenants as Sustainability Structuring Agent under PNC Capital Markets.Developing the Metrics for SuccessPNC Capital Markets' Sustainable Finance practice worked alongside NETSTREIT to develop a sustainability reporting system with key performance indicators (KPIs) centered around leveraging Science-Based Targets initiative (SBTi) metrics. The SBTi is a partnership between CDP, which runs the global environmental disclosures system; United Nations Global Compact; World Resources Institute; and the World Wide Fund for Nature. The initiative works with the private sector to drive climate action by defining best practices in emissions reductions and aiding companies in setting science-based targets in line with the latest climate science.NETSTREIT's new credit transaction contain sustainability-linked pricing terms that allow NETSTREIT to receive interest rate adjustments determined by performance against the KPI based on SBTi standards. Currently, 18 of NETSTREIT's top 20 tenants, have their own ESG commitments.[3] However, the new KPI opens NETSTREIT's door to facilitate more strategic conversations about emissions with its current and prospective tenants, as well as more control of its own emissions portfolio by incorporating SBTi into their property purchasing and leasing decisions.""We'd never considered leveraging the SBTi framework until PNC brought the idea to us,"" Blocher says. ""It was clear from the beginning that PNC was fully willing to help us create something new, innovative and impactful that our industry had not seen before.""Viewed as the most aggressive and rigorous sustainability-focused performance reporting system, SBTi helps companies identify a path to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions through a regimented five-step process to align a company's emissions trajectory with the Paris Agreement goals. SBTi does not allow companies to lean on carbon offsets in achieving their science-based target. It, instead, requires companies to reduce emissions through direct action within their own boundaries or their value chains.[4]""What impresses me about NETSTREIT is its willingness to think creatively about its footprint and what levers they have available to drive impact,"" says Evan Matzen, director of PNCCM's Sustainable Finance practice. ""NETSTREIT owns the properties but generally doesn't pay the utility bills of its tenants and doesn't manage the tenants' operations. So, the company has very little direct control over the carbon footprint of its tenants. The company's approach with SBTi preference helps address that through incentives that sets it apart from other REITs.""Blocher says the aggressive approach is the ""line in the sand"" his company was looking to draw for a deeper impact.NETSTREIT selected the SBTi reporting system as a central piece of its credit facility's KPIs. The move underscores the importance the company has placed on making an aggressive impact in the environmental space. This also demonstrates its focus on leading the real estate industry into a new era of ESG and sustainable efforts.Power of Relationship BankingPrior to joining NETSTREIT in 2020, Blocher worked for other Mid-Atlantic REITs that were banked by PNC. The relationship grew over the years and continued after he took on his role at NETSTREIT.""At its core, PNC really is a relationship bank, and we were able to show NETSTREIT that we could provide strong coverage and bring them all the financial solutions that they needed,"" says Katie Chowdhry, senior vice president and relationship manager with PNC Real Estate in the Greater Washington Area Market. ""From talking to Andy, I knew that sustainability was a big focus for NETSTREIT. So early on, we included members of our sustainable finance practice in discussions.""Blocher appreciated the collaborative nature of the work.""The PNC team was really willing to enter into a conversation with us about what we wanted to accomplish. We don't have a sustainability officer, so we did a lot of listening. There were a number of internal discussions and questions that allowed PNC to effectively advise and understand our objectives,"" Blocher says. ""It was incredible how we worked together to come up with a mutually beneficial solution.""PNC Financial Services Group, Monday, December 19, 2022, Press release pictureView additional multimedia and more ESG storytelling from PNC Financial Services Group on 3blmedia.com.Contact Info:Spokesperson: PNC Financial Services GroupWebsite: https://www.pnc.com/en/personal-banking.htmlEmail: info@3blmedia.comSOURCE: PNC Financial Services GroupView source version on accesswire.com: https://www.accesswire.com/732351/NETSTREITs-ESG-Journey-Supported-by-Sustainability-Linked-Credit-Facility]"

228,e7d739fe-a279-30c1-af12-c140b2e6ef12,TGT,2022-12-20,Institutional owners may take dramatic actions as Target Corporation's (NYSE:TGT) recent 4.1% drop adds to one-year losses,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/institutional-owners-may-dramatic-actions-120147537.html,1671537707,STORY,['TGT'],"[If you want to know who really controls Target Corporation (NYSE:TGT), then you'll have to look at the makeup of its share registry. We can see that institutions own the lion's share in the company with 81% ownership. Put another way, the group faces the maximum upside potential (or downside risk).As a result, institutional investors endured the highest losses last week after market cap fell by US$2.9b. This set of investors may especially be concerned about the current loss, which adds to a one-year loss of 33% for shareholders. Institutions or ""liquidity providers"" control large sums of money and therefore, these types of investors usually have a lot of influence over stock price movements. Hence, if weakness in Target's share price continues, institutional investors may feel compelled to sell the stock, which might not be ideal for individual investors.Let's delve deeper into each type of owner of Target, beginning with the chart below. View our latest analysis for Target ownership-breakdownWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Target?Institutions typically measure themselves against a benchmark when reporting to their own investors, so they often become more enthusiastic about a stock once it's included in a major index. We would expect most companies to have some institutions on the register, especially if they are growing.As you can see, institutional investors have a fair amount of stake in Target. This can indicate that the company has a certain degree of credibility in the investment community. However, it is best to be wary of relying on the supposed validation that comes with institutional investors. They too, get it wrong sometimes. When multiple institutions own a stock, there's always a risk that they are in a 'crowded trade'. When such a trade goes wrong, multiple parties may compete to sell stock fast. This risk is higher in a company without a history of growth. You can see Target's historic earnings and revenue below, but keep in mind there's always more to the story.Story continuesearnings-and-revenue-growthSince institutional investors own more than half the issued stock, the board will likely have to pay attention to their preferences. Hedge funds don't have many shares in Target. The Vanguard Group, Inc. is currently the largest shareholder, with 9.3% of shares outstanding. Meanwhile, the second and third largest shareholders, hold 8.2% and 7.4%, of the shares outstanding, respectively.A closer look at our ownership figures suggests that the top 25 shareholders have a combined ownership of 51% implying that no single shareholder has a majority.While studying institutional ownership for a company can add value to your research, it is also a good practice to research analyst recommendations to get a deeper understand of a stock's expected performance. There are a reasonable number of analysts covering the stock, so it might be useful to find out their aggregate view on the future.Insider Ownership Of TargetWhile the precise definition of an insider can be subjective, almost everyone considers board members to be insiders. Company management run the business, but the CEO will answer to the board, even if he or she is a member of it.I generally consider insider ownership to be a good thing. However, on some occasions it makes it more difficult for other shareholders to hold the board accountable for decisions.Our most recent data indicates that insiders own less than 1% of Target Corporation. As it is a large company, we'd only expect insiders to own a small percentage of it. But it's worth noting that they own US$149m worth of shares. Arguably recent buying and selling is just as important to consider. You can  click here to see if insiders have been buying or selling. General Public OwnershipThe general public-- including retail investors -- own 19% stake in the company, and hence can't easily be ignored. While this group can't necessarily call the shots, it can certainly have a real influence on how the company is run.Next Steps:I find it very interesting to look at who exactly owns a company. But to truly gain insight, we need to consider other information, too.

If you want to see more stocks in this selection, check out 5 Best Medical Technology Stocks To Buy. The global medical devices market is expected to grow from $495.46 billion in 2022 to $718.92 billion by 2029 at a CAGR of 5.5% during the forecast period. Increasing investments in research and development by medical technology firms, combined with favorable policies and regulations, are anticipated to advance the medical device industry over the next few years. Following the pandemic years, digital healthcare has become indispensable, and the medical technology industry has seen meaningful demand for online medical and AI-powered technology services. Companies in the digital healthcare space have witnessed their stocks rally despite economic turbulence. During the pandemic, seeing the accelerating demand for medtech treatment options, many conventional healthcare companies transformed themselves and offered technology-led health solutions to survive and gain market share. Some of the most popular medtech solutions include telemedicine, robotic surgery, medical imaging technologies, wearable medical devices, and AI-led healthcare management options. Investors seeking exposure to the medical technology sector can pick up stocks like DexCom, Inc. (NASDAQ:DXCM), Intuitive Surgical, Inc. (NASDAQ:ISRG), and Danaher Corporation (NYSE:DHR). Our Methodology We selected the following medical technology stocks based on positive analyst coverage, strong business fundamentals, and market visibility. We have assessed the hedge fund sentiment from Insider Monkey’s database of 920 elite hedge funds tracked as of the end of the third quarter of 2022. The list is arranged according to the number of hedge fund holders in each firm. Best Medical Technology Stocks to Buy11. Stryker Corporation (NYSE:SYK)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 34Stryker Corporation (NYSE:SYK) is a Michigan-based medical technology company that operates through two segments – MedSurg and Neurotechnology, and Orthopaedics and Spine. The company offers implants for use in joint replacements and trauma surgeries. Stryker Corporation (NYSE:SYK) also provides surgical equipment and surgical navigation systems, endoscopic and communications systems, emergency medical equipment, intensive care disposable products, and reprocessed and remanufactured medical devices. Story continuesOn December 7, Stryker Corporation (NYSE:SYK) declared a $0.75 per share quarterly dividend, a 7.9% increase from its prior dividend of $0.695. The dividend is payable on January 31, 2023 to shareholders of record on December 30. The dividend yield on December 19 came in at 1.25%. Cowen analyst Joshua Jennings on December 14 raised the price target on Stryker Corporation (NYSE:SYK) to $283 from $233 and kept an Outperform rating on the shares. The analyst said the company looks positioned to provide positive 2023 revenue guidance on the back of a strong fourth quarter.According to Insider Monkey’s data, 34 hedge funds were bullish on Stryker Corporation (NYSE:SYK) at the end of September 2022, compared to 46 funds in the prior quarter. Terry Smith’s Fundsmith LLP is the largest stakeholder of the company, with 5.6 million shares worth $1.14 billion.Like DexCom, Inc. (NASDAQ:DXCM), Intuitive Surgical, Inc. (NASDAQ:ISRG), and Danaher Corporation (NYSE:DHR), Stryker Corporation (NYSE:SYK) is one of the premier medical technology stocks to consider. Diamond Hill Capital made the following comment about Stryker Corporation (NYSE:SYK) in its Q3 2022 investor letter:“Stryker Corporation (NYSE:SYK) was the only new addition to the portfolio in Q3. It is one of the largest medical device manufacturers with a track record of consistently outgrowing its end markets and competitors. Stryker has a highly performance driven culture with a decentralized operating model that results in strong incentive alignment within the company. We believe the management team has executed well, making small but meaningful decisions that have positioned the firm well among competitors. Management operates with a market share gain mentality and strives to be a category leader in the market they are in. Stryker also benefits from its broad portfolio of surgical tools, small and large cap hospital equipment, waste management products, etc., which enables it to address all the needs of a hospital operating room and be a one-stop shop for health care facilities. This is particularly appealing to hospitals, and it positions Stryker to be the supplier of all operating room equipment versus a single product, thus enabling the company to gain market share.”10. Inspire Medical Systems, Inc. (NYSE:INSP)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 37Inspire Medical Systems, Inc. (NYSE:INSP) is a Minnesota-based medical technology company focused on the development and commercialization of minimally invasive solutions for patients with obstructive sleep apnea in the United States and internationally. It is one of the best medical technology stocks to invest in. On November 1, Inspire Medical Systems, Inc. (NYSE:INSP) reported a revenue of $109.2 million, up 77.0% year-over-year, beating Wall Street estimates by $14.59 million. Inspire Medical Systems, Inc. (NYSE:INSP) raised its full-year 2022 revenue guidance to between $384 million to $388 million, which would represent growth of 65% to 66% over the 2021 revenue of $233.4 million. This compares to the prior revenue guidance of $354 million to $362 million and a Wall Street estimate of $361.29 million.Goldman Sachs analyst Amit Hazan upgraded Inspire Medical Systems, Inc. (NYSE:INSP) on December 13 to Buy from Neutral with a price target of $308, up from $245. Given ""strong visibility"" and the company's ""track record of execution,"" the analyst sees upside to present consensus and expects ""strong"" upcoming 2023 guidance. Given multiple compression over the last six months relative to the group, the shares now offer improved better risk/reward, added the analyst, who categorized Inspire Medical Systems, Inc. (NYSE:INSP) as his top Medtech midcap for 2023.According to Insider Monkey’s data, Inspire Medical Systems, Inc. (NYSE:INSP) was part of 37 hedge fund portfolios at the end of Q3 2022, compared to 31 in the prior quarter. Andreas Halvorsen’s Viking Global held the largest stake in the company, comprising 633,572 shares worth $112.3 million. Here is what Alger Capital specifically said about Inspire Medical Systems, Inc. (NYSE:INSP) in its Q2 2022 investor letter:“Inspire Medical Systems, Inc. (NYSE:INSP) markets the only FDA-approved implantable neuromodulation device used to treat obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). Inspire’s device monitors a patient’s breathing and delivers electrical stimulation to the hypoglossal nerve in order to maintain an open airway.We believe the second quarter underperformance of Inspire shares is primarily attributable to the rotation away from high-growth, high-valuation health care names that are currently unprofitable. Additionally, we think the underperformance was compounded by Inspire being one of the best-performing medical device stocks in the first quarter. We believe many investors have been “selling the winners” in a risk-off environment. Looking ahead, we continue to believe that Inspire is one of the best growth opportunities in medical devices with no anticipated immediate competition. We also believe its market is highly underpenetrated.”9. Align Technology, Inc. (NASDAQ:ALGN)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 38Align Technology, Inc. (NASDAQ:ALGN) is an Arizona-based medical device company that designs, manufactures, and markets Invisalign clear aligners and iTero intraoral scanners and services for restorative and aesthetic dentistry. On October 31, Align Technology, Inc. (NASDAQ:ALGN) announced an accelerated stock repurchase agreement with Goldman Sachs to repurchase $200 million of its common stock as part of the $1 billion share repurchase program disclosed in May. The transaction will be funded with cash on hand and is expected to conclude by February 1, 2023. Align Technology, Inc. (NASDAQ:ALGN) is one of the premier medical technology stocks to monitor. On October 27, Stifel analyst Jonathan Block maintained a Buy recommendation on Align Technology, Inc. (NASDAQ:ALGN) but lowered the price target on the shares to $265 from $325. Following the company's Q3 results and guidance, 2022 and 2023 EBITDA and EPS estimates are likely to ""come toppling down,"" said the analyst. Now, investors ""will have to decide if the tables could turn in coming quarters,"" noted Block, who added that comps will ease, innovation should improve, and that Align Technology, Inc. (NASDAQ:ALGN)’s market share ""seems to be relatively resilient.""According to Insider Monkey’s data, 38 hedge funds were bullish on Align Technology, Inc. (NASDAQ:ALGN) at the end of September 2022, compared to 33 funds in the last quarter. Brian Bares’ Bares Capital Management is the largest position holder in the company, with 913,324 shares worth over $189 million. Here is what Polen Global Growth has to say about Align Technology, Inc. (NASDAQ:ALGN) in its Q2 2022 investor letter:“Align Technology shares declined significantly during the second quarter when management reported a meaningful deceleration in growth. Management cited a host of challenges, including COVID19 impacts, especially in China with restrictions and lockdowns under their zero-COVID policy, a weaker economic environment, inflationary pressures, supply chain disruptions, and the war in Ukraine, to name a few. Tough comparisons were also a reality — Invisalign case starts in 1Q22 were roughly flat, having lapped the 66% growth from the prior year. It’s not completely surprising that growth is slowing on such tough comparisons, but the company’s shares declined on the news.By looking at Align’s three-year compound average growth rate (CAGR) to smooth out the ups and downs through COVID, key metrics like Invisalign case shipment, clear aligner revenue, and earnings per share have all grown ~20% during the trailing three years. We think this is quite respectable given the challenges during this period, but the lack of near-term momentum or visibility has not been well received in the current environment. According to our research, Align is the clear market leader, has global scale, a superior product, and still very modest market penetration. While growth may be challenged near term, we remain confident in the long-term growth opportunity.”8. Veeva Systems Inc. (NYSE:VEEV)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 42Veeva Systems Inc. (NYSE:VEEV) is a California-based company that provides cloud-based software for the life sciences industry in North America, Europe, the Asia Pacific, the Middle East, Africa, and Latin America. The company offers customer relationship management and data management applications for the medical industry. It is one of the premier medical technology stocks to monitor. On December 1, Veeva Systems Inc. (NYSE:VEEV) reported a Q3 non-GAAP EPS of $1.13 and a revenue of $552.35 million, outperforming Wall Street estimates by $0.06 and $6.29 million, respectively. Non-GAAP operating income for the third quarter was $219.5 million, compared to $199.4 million a year ago, representing an increase of 10% year-over-year.KeyBanc analyst Scott Schoenhaus on December 5 maintained an Overweight rating on Veeva Systems Inc. (NYSE:VEEV) but lowered the price target on the shares to $210 from $220 to reflect some multiple impairment as the company works toward moving its CRM business from Salesforce to its Vault Platform when the contract expires in September 2025. The analyst noted the company posted a strong quarter with top and bottom-line beats, but guided slightly below expectations on Q4 billings, revenue, and operating profits.According to Insider Monkey’s third quarter database, 42 hedge funds were long Veeva Systems Inc. (NYSE:VEEV), compared to 45 funds in the prior quarter. Greg Poole’s Echo Street Capital Management is the largest position holder in the company, with 899,876 shares worth $148.3 million. Here is what Artisan Partners specifically said about Veeva Systems Inc. (NYSE:VEEV) in its Q2 2022 investor letter:“Veeva Systems Inc. (NYSE:VEEV) is one of the highest quality franchises in our portfolio. The company has the dominant CRM platform for pharmaceutical sales and marketing organizations, and it is replicating that success with the rollout of numerous other modules focused on pharmaceutical customers’ manufacturing, quality, safety and clinical operations. Growth has temporarily slowed over the past year as the company laps difficult YoY comparisons caused by the rapid adoption of their virtual sales call solution during the pandemic. Several large deals also encountered unexpected delays in late 2021. Despite these short-term headwinds, we remain confident in Veeva’s future growth prospects and high-quality business model (~40% free cash flow margins supported by largely recurring subscription revenues). Meanwhile, we believe the defensive nature of its end market (health care) and strategic importance of cloud IT driven transformations could help buffer the company against a weaker global economy. As shares declined in Q2 along with other software stocks, we added to our position.”7. Bio-Rad Laboratories, Inc. (NYSE:BIO)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 45Bio-Rad Laboratories, Inc. (NYSE:BIO) is one of the best medical technology stocks to consider buying. The California-based company manufactures and distributes life science research and clinical diagnostic products in the United States, Europe, Asia, Canada, and Latin America. Bio-Rad Laboratories, Inc. (NYSE:BIO) focuses on selected segments of the life sciences market such as proteomics, genomics, biopharmaceutical production, cellular biology, and food safety. It is one of the leading medical technology stocks to buy. On December 6, RBC Capital analyst Conor McNamara initiated coverage of Bio-Rad Laboratories, Inc. (NYSE:BIO) with an Outperform rating and a $565 price target. He believes shareholders will benefit from ""an extended period of multiple expansion"" as the company continues to deliver revenue acceleration and margin improvement. The stock trades at a 60%-70% discount to peers and with $200 per share in cash and investments has ""the most balance sheet optionality of any company in our sector,"" the analyst noted.According to Insider Monkey’s data, 45 hedge funds were bullish on Bio-Rad Laboratories, Inc. (NYSE:BIO) at the end of the third quarter of 2022, compared to 43 funds in the prior quarter. Israel Englander’s Millennium Management is the biggest position holder in the company, with 458,645 shares worth $191.3 million. 6. Medtronic plc (NYSE:MDT)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 55Medtronic plc (NYSE:MDT) develops, manufactures, and commercializes device-based medical therapies to healthcare systems, physicians, clinicians, and patients worldwide. The company operates through Cardiovascular Portfolio, Medical Surgical Portfolio, Neuroscience Portfolio, and Diabetes Operating Unit segments. On December 8, Medtronic plc (NYSE:MDT) declared a quarterly dividend of $0.68 per share, in line with previous. The dividend is payable on January 13, 2022 to shareholders of record on December 21. The dividend yield on December 19 came in at 3.55%. On November 30, Wells Fargo analyst Larry Biegelsen maintained an Equal Weight rating on Medtronic plc (NYSE:MDT) and trimmed the firm's price target on the shares to $77 from $82. The analyst updated his 2024 and forward EPS forecast for Medtronic plc (NYSE:MDT), as he factored in the FX impact on EPS.According to Insider Monkey’s third quarter database, 55 hedge funds were bullish on Medtronic plc (NYSE:MDT), compared to 54 funds in the earlier quarter. Peter Rathjens, Bruce Clarke, and John Campbell’s Arrowstreet Capital is the largest stakeholder of the company, with 7.16 million shares worth $578.30 million. Like DexCom, Inc. (NASDAQ:DXCM), Intuitive Surgical, Inc. (NASDAQ:ISRG), and Danaher Corporation (NYSE:DHR), Medtronic plc (NYSE:MDT) is one of the best medical technology stocks to invest in. Here is what Artisan Partners specifically said about Medtronic plc (NYSE:MDT) in its Q2 2022 investor letter:“While Medtronic plc (NYSE:MDT)’s procedure volumes recovered to pre-COVID levels, foreign exchange headwinds overshadowed underlying business value growth, and supply chain issues, including those related to China’s lockdowns, impacted the surgical innovations business. The downdraft in the market during the quarter led to a pile-on. We are being patient with our investment in Medtronic because the company continues to be a strong free cash flow generator and is attractively priced, with a FCF yield of 5% on trailing one-year numbers and a dividend yield of 3%. Medtronic is under new management that is focused on growing the company’s top line, reinvesting in R&amp;D, returning cash to shareholders and growing operating profits. We like new management’s strategy and believe new product launches, increased surgery visits, sound M&amp;A transactions and a shareholder returns focus, should reinvigorate the business. We added to our positions in these health care names during the quarter.” Click to continue reading and see 5 Best Medical Technology Stocks To Buy.  Suggested articles:12 Dividend Stocks That Outperform S&amp;P 50010 Stocks Under $5 With High Potential10 Best Performing Technology ETFs in 2022 Disclosure: None. 11 Best Medical Technology Stocks To Buy is originally published on Insider Monkey.]"

(NASDAQ:ROST)?",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/too-consider-buying-ross-stores-160141475.html,1671465701,STORY,['ROST'],"[Ross Stores, Inc. (NASDAQ:ROST) received a lot of attention from a substantial price increase on the NASDAQGS over the last few months. With many analysts covering the large-cap stock, we may expect any price-sensitive announcements have already been factored into the stock’s share price. However, could the stock still be trading at a relatively cheap price? Let’s examine Ross Stores’s valuation and outlook in more detail to determine if there’s still a bargain opportunity. Check out our latest analysis for Ross Stores Is Ross Stores Still Cheap?The stock seems fairly valued at the moment according to my valuation model. It’s trading around 18% below my intrinsic value, which means if you buy Ross Stores today, you’d be paying a reasonable price for it. And if you believe the company’s true value is $138.22, then there isn’t much room for the share price grow beyond what it’s currently trading. So, is there another chance to buy low in the future? Given that Ross Stores’s share is fairly volatile (i.e. its price movements are magnified relative to the rest of the market) this could mean the price can sink lower, giving us an opportunity to buy later on. This is based on its high beta, which is a good indicator for share price volatility.What kind of growth will Ross Stores generate?earnings-and-revenue-growthFuture outlook is an important aspect when you’re looking at buying a stock, especially if you are an investor looking for growth in your portfolio. Although value investors would argue that it’s the intrinsic value relative to the price that matter the most, a more compelling investment thesis would be high growth potential at a cheap price. With profit expected to grow by 45% over the next couple of years, the future seems bright for Ross Stores. It looks like higher cash flow is on the cards for the stock, which should feed into a higher share valuation.What This Means For YouAre you a shareholder? It seems like the market has already priced in ROST’s positive outlook, with shares trading around its fair value. However, there are also other important factors which we haven’t considered today, such as the financial strength of the company. Have these factors changed since the last time you looked at the stock? Will you have enough confidence to invest in the company should the price drop below its fair value?Story continuesAre you a potential investor? If you’ve been keeping tabs on ROST, now may not be the most optimal time to buy, given it is trading around its fair value. However, the optimistic prospect is encouraging for the company, which means it’s worth further examining other factors such as the strength of its balance sheet, in order to take advantage of the next price drop.In light of this, if you'd like to do more analysis on the company, it's vital to be informed of the risks involved.

Price and Consensus Amazon.com, Inc. Price and ConsensusAmazon.com, Inc. price-consensus-chart | Amazon.com, Inc. Quote Disruption at AmazonThe workers’ strike at the time of Christmas – the busiest shopping period, for an online retailer is a matter of grave concern. This is likely to affect the e-commerce giant’s pre-Christmas business.Hence, such a broad strike by Amazon employees in Germany, the company’s second-largest market, is expected to jeopardize its holiday season prospects.We note that the shipment and fulfillment centers aid AMZN in storing and shipping products and handling returns quickly.

It may not have been easy to hold on to ROST for all that time, but if you did, how much would your investment be worth today?Ross Stores' Business In-DepthWith that in mind, let's take a look at Ross Stores' main business drivers.Based in Dublin, CA, Ross Stores Inc. operates as an off-price retailer of apparel and home accessories, primarily in the United States. The company operates its stores under the Ross Dress for Less (Ross) and dd’s DISCOUNTS names. The company’s stores are located mostly in community and neighborhood shopping centers in heavily populated urban and suburban areas.Ross Stores primarily offers in-season, branded, and designer apparel, footwear, accessories and other home-related merchandise for everyone in the family. This format primarily targets middle-income households. Prices offered at Ross are generally 20% to 60% below the regular prices of most department and specialty stores.dd’s DISCOUNTS features more moderately-priced first-quality, in-season, name brand apparel, accessories, footwear, and home fashions for the entire family. These stores target moderate-income households. The dd’s DISCOUNTS stores offer products at a 20% to 70% lesser price than the moderate department and discount stores.Ross Stores remains focused with its store expansion initiatives over the years. Further, the company’s efforts to expand base by making efforts to increase penetration in the existing as well as new markets. In this regard, it opened 26 stores across nine different states in February and March.Story continuesAs of Sep 30, 2022, Ross Stores operated 2,019 outlets, including 1,696 Ross stores across 40 states, the District of Columbia and Guam, and 323 dd’s DISCOUNTS stores in 21 states.Bottom LineWhile anyone can invest, building a lucrative investment portfolio takes research, patience, and a little bit of risk. If you had invested in Ross Stores ten years ago, you're probably feeling pretty good about your investment today.A $1000 investment made in December 2012 would be worth $4,283.83, or a gain of 328.38%, as of December 19, 2022, according to our calculations. This return excludes dividends but includes price appreciation.In comparison, the S&amp;P 500 gained 172.53% and the price of gold went up 3.15% over the same time frame.Looking ahead, analysts are expecting more upside for ROST.Ross Stores has outpaced the industry in the past three months, courtesy of improved SG&amp;A expense, sequential gains at dd’s DISCOUNTS and favorable traffic trends, which aided third-quarter fiscal 2022 results. The company reported top and bottom line beat in the fiscal third quarter. The decline in incentive costs resulted in lower SG&amp;A expense during the quarter. It has been benefiting from the execution of its store expansion plans over the years. It provided an upbeat view for Q4 and fiscal 2022. However, the company’s fiscal third quarter results were impacted by ongoing financial pressures on dd’s customers and increased markdowns, resulting in year over year decline in sales and earnings. In Q4, it expects the highly promotional holiday season and inflationary costs to put pressure on low-to-moderate income customers.The stock has jumped 5.91% over the past four weeks. Additionally, no earnings estimate has gone lower in the past two months, compared to 9 higher, for fiscal 2023; the consensus estimate has moved up as well.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

However, it's crucial to keep an eye toward the future and continue to save - even during more challenging economic times. The key to staying on track is thinking through your retirement wants and needs so that you can chart your course of action.Here are five tips to help you create your roadmap.Take Stock of Your PrioritiesIt's important to take a moment and consider what you want out of your retirement. This is the part of the planning process where you consider all the top priorities in your life. Think about short-term goals, like buying a new car or taking an international trip, mid-term goals, such as contributing to your grandkid's college education - and don't forget long-term goals. This might include having enough money to leave your kids and grandkids with money for their future. These goals all represent different destinations along your retirement roadmap. It also helps to have an estimated retirement age in mind.The point of this exercise is to help you approach each goal with a critical lens - what does a successful retirement look like to you and what is the cost? By looking at your list of goals you can more easily focus your time, energy and money on the things that are most important.Assess Your FinancesOnce you have a better idea of your retirement goals, it's time to assess where you stand financially and understand your future retirement spending needs.Your retirement savings plan will largely be driven by how much you've saved thus far and how much you can save going forward. This includes assets, income and investments. Your investments may include equity in a home, Social Security benefits, individual retirement plan investments, savings accounts and more. To help give you an estimate of how much money you'll need to retire, try this online Regions calculator.Story continuesThis step is particularly important in today's environment. Taking the time to closely review your finances will help you to be more aware of where your money is going and any adjustments that need to be made. For example, you may find that you're able to save less than you had previously because that money is now going to the increased costs for necessities. Just remember, even saving a little bit each month or from each paycheck for your retirement will add up over time.Anticipate Bumps and Forks in the RoadKeep in mind when planning for retirement that there will be unexpected events or changes in your plans. This can include anything from a new marriage, divorce, death of a loved one or unexpected illness.It's also important not to overlook potential economic shifts like inflation. As we've seen this year, the cost of goods and services will go up, so make sure to account for this in the planning process.Keep in mind, financial priorities look different for everyone and may continue to shift throughout the years. The best thing you can do is anticipate that your plan will change - no matter how early you begin the process!Work with a ProfessionalWorking with a wealth advisor or financial professional is another great way to get a better idea of where you currently stand and what your long-term financial picture might look like. Financial professionals can help you factor in things like expenses, unexpected costs and life events, and how market performance could impact your future. They can also help you make adjustments and get back on course when unexpected events occur along the way.Don't Forget to Enjoy the PresentAs you think about retirement, it's important to keep in mind that planning for the future shouldn't take away from enjoying the present when you can. A good retirement plan balances a fulfilling lifestyle now with progress towards milestones in the years ahead. Starting the process early, evaluating your goals and keeping stock of your finances are all key steps that will help you on the road to retirement.If you're looking to learn more about planning for retirement, check out Next Step's Retirement Savings and Planning Resource Center.Regions Bank, Monday, December 19, 2022, Press release pictureView additional multimedia and more ESG storytelling from Regions Bank on 3blmedia.com.Contact Info:Spokesperson: Regions BankWebsite: profiles/regions-bankEmail: info@3blmedia.comSOURCE: Regions BankView source version on accesswire.com: https://www.accesswire.com/732334/Creating-a-Roadmap-for-Your-Retirement-Goals]"

Typically, we'll want to notice a trend of growing return on capital employed (ROCE) and alongside that, an expanding base of capital employed. Put simply, these types of businesses are compounding machines, meaning they are continually reinvesting their earnings at ever-higher rates of return. With that in mind, the ROCE of Visa (NYSE:V) looks great, so lets see what the trend can tell us.What Is Return On Capital Employed (ROCE)?Just to clarify if you're unsure, ROCE is a metric for evaluating how much pre-tax income (in percentage terms) a company earns on the capital invested in its business. To calculate this metric for Visa, this is the formula:Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)0.31 = US$20b ÷ (US$86b - US$21b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to September 2022).Therefore, Visa has an ROCE of 31%. That's a fantastic return and not only that, it outpaces the average of 12% earned by companies in a similar industry. See our latest analysis for Visa roceAbove you can see how the current ROCE for Visa compares to its prior returns on capital, but there's only so much you can tell from the past. If you're interested, you can view the analysts predictions in our free report on analyst forecasts for the company.How Are Returns Trending?Visa has not disappointed with their ROCE growth. More specifically, while the company has kept capital employed relatively flat over the last five years, the ROCE has climbed 43% in that same time. So our take on this is that the business has increased efficiencies to generate these higher returns, all the while not needing to make any additional investments. The company is doing well in that sense, and it's worth investigating what the management team has planned for long term growth prospects.What We Can Learn From Visa's ROCEIn summary, we're delighted to see that Visa has been able to increase efficiencies and earn higher rates of return on the same amount of capital. And investors seem to expect more of this going forward, since the stock has rewarded shareholders with a 87% return over the last five years. With that being said, we still think the promising fundamentals mean the company deserves some further due diligence.Story continuesOne more thing to note, we've identified   1 warning sign  with Visa and understanding this should be part of your investment process.Visa is not the only stock earning high returns.

The company proposed deploying the system on the Ethereum layer 2 network StarkNet.Currently, there are two types of accounts on the Ethereum network: Externally Owned Accounts (EOA) controlled by a private key, and Contract Accounts (CA), which are essentially smart contracts.EOAs can initiate transactions, but CAs cannot. However, by using Account Abstraction it is possible to create a smart contract that can initiate transactions on behalf of an EOA, enabling the creation of a self-custodial wallet that can make automatic recurring payments, Visa said.Account Abstraction (AA) is a proposal that aims to combine user accounts and smart contracts into a single type of account on the Ethereum blockchain. This is possible by allowing for the creation of validity rules for individual transactions.One use case for AA is the creation of ""delegable accounts,"" which allow for the automation of payments through the use of smart contracts.With a delegable account, a user can delegate the ability to initiate a payment to a pre-approved smart contract, known as an ""auto payment contract,” Visa said.Here’s how it could hypothetically work: When a user visits a merchant's website and agrees to allow for auto payments, the auto payment contract's address is added to the user's allow list.The merchant could then trigger a payment by calling the charge function of the auto payment contract, causing the user's account to initiate a payment that will be valid due to its presence on the allow list.As of Tuesday, Visa did not reveal any plans to use the system as part of its offered services.]"

Now that the Sam Bankman-Fried news is beginning to subside, Fed Chair Jerome Powell is reemerging as crypto’s primary antagonist, even if unintentionally so.The takeaway is that crypto assets prices will largely be driven by inflation figures, the size of the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet and market interpretations of Fed officials’ statements.

The yellow metal is trading slightly lower for 2022, and is also down substantially from peaks hit during the initial days of the Russia-Ukraine conflict.Spot gold fell 0.1% to $1,785.46 an ounce, while gold futures fell 0.2% to $1,794.60 an ounce by 19:25 ET (00:25 GMT).The latest selling pressure on gold comes from a series of hawkish central bank comments last week, which heralded a continued rise in interest rates in the coming year. The trend spells more pressure on gold and other metals, as rising rates battered the metals market by driving up the opportunity cost of holding non-yielding assets.Investors are now also concerned over a potential recession in 2023, driven chiefly by high inflation and rising interest rates.Focus on slowing economic growth is also expected to define the last two trading weeks of 2022 amid a dearth of other cues. Trading volumes are also expected to be diminished by a series of market holidays.Other precious metals also retreated on Tuesday.Among industrial metals, copper prices were steadier than their peers amid continued bets that an economic recovery in China will fuel copper demand.Copper futures rose 0.1% to $3.7637 a pound.But the red metal’s outlook remains clouded by uncertainty over a global recession, with weakening economic activity across the globe likely to offset a demand recovery in major importer China.Story continuesStill, tightening copper supply, due to political unrest in top producers Chile and Peru, is likely to help support prices in the coming months.Related ArticlesGold prices slip further below $1,800 as rate hike fears weighOil climbs, but uncertainty on China COVID surge caps gainsRainforest-rich nations ensure COP15 deal on nature sticks]"

The sol rose 0.3% after Peruvian President Dina Boluarte, who is leading a transitional government following the ouster of her predecessor, said she will replace the prime minister as part of a reshuffling of her Cabinet. ""The move is Boluarte's attempt to seek support in order to approve early elections amid ongoing protests,"" Citi strategists wrote in a client note. ""She declared the reshuffling aims to build a 'political team' to facilitate dialogue in the country, and said the new elections cannot be held without new political reforms."" Currencies of oil exporters Mexico and Colombia added 0.4% and 0.2% respectively as crude prices rose on hopes of a recovery in demand. Mexico's economy likely contracted by 0.1% in November compared with the previous month, a preliminary estimate from national statistics agency INEGI showed. The dollar retreated from a rally supported by hawkish tones from major central banks last week. Brazil's real reversed losses and climbed 0.3% as President-elect Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva scored two key victories after the Supreme Court granted an injunction allowing him to increase social investment, while also outlawing an opaque congressional spending program. Investors are still awaiting a decision by Brazil's lower house to increase the spending cap by 145 billion reais ($27.8 billion) for each year to cover payments of 600 reais a month under the Bolsa Familia welfare program. It was approved by the Senate in early December. ""There is a really good story developing in Brazil,"" said Edmund Shing, chief investment officer at BNP Paribas Wealth Management. ""You have a very strong commodity backdrop, with both mining and oil; secondly, you have a government that has been successful before, the market may see that the political climate will be more stable than it was under Bolsonaro; and thirdly, interest rates are already incredibly high in Brazil."" Still, gains in most Latin American currencies were limited after China officially reported its first coronavirus-related deaths since unwinding some of its strictest pandemic control measures earlier this month. Chile's peso dipped 0.4% as concerns about China's efforts to exit from its zero-COVID strategies outweighed a rise in prices of copper, the South American country's main export. Latin American economies, which rely heavily on China as a trading partner, have been bogged down by worries that Beijing's rapid easing of COVID-19 control measures could lead to more infections and further disruptions to demand.

For the 20th year, the elves at Verizon are partnering with the North American Aerospace Defense Command (NORAD) to provide a toll-free hotline for children to track Santa’s whereabouts as he and his reindeer travel across the globe to spread holiday cheer.The elves at Verizon have been busy in the workshop this year to enable children around the globe to connect with NORAD volunteers on all their burning questions, from Santa’s location to the names of the reindeer and the best cookies to leave out for that special visit. This year, Verizon has rapidly expanded 5G service across the nation and now covers more than 175 million people with 5G Ultra Wideband service, allowing NORAD volunteers to connect faster and with more people including an advanced 5G on-site network, and an enhanced tracker to monitor call volume for Santa.“For 20 years, our elves at Verizon have been honored to provide the network America relies on for the NORAD Tracks Santa initiative that delights millions of children,” said Maggie Hallbach, senior vice president, Public Sector at Verizon Business. “There is no greater joy than being able to support our partners at NORAD to bring the magical Santa tracking tradition to life.”The Interactive Voice Response System (IVR) allows the children who call in to interact with the system and learn exactly where Santa is in his flight. Also, to ensure that every call is a positive experience for the children, should an elf not be available, Verizon Business Consulting Services engineers designed and deployed a call management system with error handling software (failover logic). This means that even if the child cannot reach a call center volunteer, they will be told where Santa is at that point in time.Story continues“From the very beginning, 20 years ago, the Verizon Business Consulting Services team has and continues to play a critical role in the initial design and deployment of the Interactive Voice Response System (IVR) that is so critical to connecting children with Santa,” said Tara Sunderraj, Vice President for Verizon Business Consulting Services. “Through the years, as technology has evolved, so have our roles, from development to assisting with the overall design and audio messages that let the children actually interact with Santa’s elves.”Meanwhile, after almost a year of planning, the U.S. Capitol Christmas Tree, a 78-foot red spruce affectionately called “Ruby,” was harvested from the Pisgah National Forest near Asheville, N.C. The harvest ceremony took place November 2, and the Verizon Frontline Crisis Response Team provided critical connectivity to the U.S. Forest Service during the event to help ensure Ruby could be safely cut down and placed on a specialized tractor trailer for its long journey to the U.S. Capitol lawn.In addition to connecting and supporting the NORAD Tracks Santa hotline and operations center, nearly 900 in-person and over 200 virtual volunteers, which include Verizon employees, military personnel and other government and corporate partners, will come together to make the magic of NORAD Tracks Santa possible again this year. Thousands of children will be able to contact NORAD on Dec. 24 for answers to important questions such as:Where is Santa?When will Santa come to my house?Where is Mrs. Claus during the journey?What are Santa's favorite cookies?How many elves are helping Santa?Which reindeer is helping to lead the journey this year?Tools to help track St. NickVolunteers will be onsite in NORAD's call center. Here is information on the hotline along with other methods children and their families are encouraged to utilize to track Santa:Phone: The toll-free hotline – 1-877-Hi-NORAD (1-877-446-6723) – will be in operation for calls beginning at 6AM (Eastern Standard Time) on Dec. 24. Program the hotline number into your Verizon phone as “NORAD Call Center.” On Christmas Eve, have your child use the voice command to call the NORAD Call Center, and enjoy NORAD’s Santa Tracker as volunteers do their best to answer your child’s pressing questions.Online: On Dec. 24, families can also visit the NORAD Tracks Santa website with links to several ‘SantaCams’ on NORAD Tracks Santa’s social media pages that capture Santa’s flight through various locations around the world. To experience the magic throughout the day, visit the website www.noradsanta.org on desktop or mobile for more fun activities. While Santa is in flight, children can see his whereabouts, play games, learn about holiday traditions around the world and dive deeper on how NORAD tracks Santa.For more information on Santa’s whereabouts, visit https://www.noradsanta.org/ or track via Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, and YouTube.

Thousands of southwest Florida small businesses were affected by the storm. To aid in the recovery, Verizon partnered with Collaboratory, a local nonprofit community-problem solving organization in Southwest Florida, and Florida TaxWatch, a trusted nonprofit organization that serves as the ‘eyes and ears’ of Florida taxpayers and promotes economic development across the state, to create the $10,000 grant program.Collaboratory and Florida TaxWatch worked with community leaders to select the final 25 small businesses from the hundreds of deserving applicants and nominees.“We are thrilled to have received this grant as these funds will help us invest in sales channels to grow outside of Southwest Florida while our community focuses on rebuilding,” said grant recipient and CEO of Flying Eagle Kombucha, Maddy Eagle. “It will also assist us in strengthening our impact here at home, while we continue to support our local farms, community gardens, and their missions for a sustainable region.”Story continuesThe full list of small business grant recipients includes:Captain Josh GreerCaptain Ozzie Lessinger Chocolattés Roasting, LLC Cracker Box RestaurantD &amp; D Matlacha Bait &amp; Tackle Exclusive Affair Party RentalsF.I.S.H of Sanibel-Captiva, Inc.

259,783113c9-647d-30eb-ba83-f2d23ed96fad,SWK,2022-12-20,3 Consumer Discretionary Stocks to Sell on Failing Fundamentals,InvestorPlace,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/3-consumer-discretionary-stocks-sell-135508201.html,1671198908,STORY,"['SWK', 'LYV', 'NWL', 'VFC']","[If you’re looking for consumer discretionary stocks to sell, VF Corp. (NYSE:VFC) shareholders might want to reconsider their positions.  CEO Steve Rendle stepped down as CEO of the apparel conglomerate on Dec. 5. The move, which came as a surprise to many industry experts, suggests that the board increasingly was growing disenchanted with the company’s fundamentals, especially in North America. Rendle had been CEO for nearly six years and spent almost 25 years with the company. To step aside without a succession plan in place sounds like a leader who was pushed out rather than a traditional retirement.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsWith economic uncertainty factoring into corporate decisions, VF can’t be the only consumer discretionary name struggling. According to Yardeni Research, the S&amp;P 500 consumer discretionary sector was down 32.7% year-to-date through Dec. 12. A quick screen of consumer discretionary stocks gives me 132 names to choose from. Of those, I’ll only consider stocks down at least 20% YTD. That brings the total down to 42 names.Here are my three consumer discretionary stocks to sell heading into 2023.LYVLive Nation Entertainment$70.23SWKStanley Black &amp; Decker78.07NWLNewell Brands$13.20Live Nation Entertainment (LYV)Live Nation website displayed on smartphone hidden in jeans pocket.Source: Piotr Swat / ShutterstockLive Nation Entertainment (NYSE:LYV) is down over 40% YTD. When you combine terrible public relations from the Taylor Swift ticket-buying fiasco at its Ticketmaster subsidiary with a Department of Justice (DOJ) antitrust investigation that reportedly opened before November’s brouhaha, Live Nation shareholders might be wise to head for the exits before the Feds decide to crack down on Ticketmaster’s monopoly. It’s not a good look.Ticketmaster and Taylor Swift did say that the pre-sale for her Eras tour sold 2.4 million tickets, the most ever sold for an artist in a single day. Further, the company said that there were 90% fewer tickets sold on secondary resale websites. Story continuesAnalysts believe that a DOJ investigation won’t solve the problem of secondary markets.“From a big picture perspective, the fact that people are wanting to go see live music with this much enthusiasm should be really good for Live Nation in the long term,” stated William Blair analyst Ryan Sundby.The biggest problem is if the DOJ forces Live Nation to break apart from Ticketmaster because they’ve become completely intertwined.In Q3 2022, the company’s concert segment generated $5.29 billion in revenue, up from $2.15 billion a year earlier. While concerts accounted for 86% of its overall revenue, it relies on Ticketmaster to handle ticketing for many of its concerts. Ticketing accounted for 8.6% of its overall revenue in the third quarter. The company’s third segment is sponsorship &amp; advertising. It accounted for 5.6% of Live Nation’s overall revenue. It works with the other two segments to generate revenue. A breakup would hurt all three of the company’s operating segments. Until this issue is sorted, LYV stock will face downward pressure. I would sell before then.Stanley Black &amp; Decker (SWK)Stanley Black and Decker (SWK) is a manufacturer of industrial tools and household hardware and provider of security productsSource: ricochet64 / Shutterstock.comMy wife’s business partner’s favorite power tool brand is DeWalt, which has been owned by Black &amp; Decker since 1960 when it acquired the company from AMF, a conglomerate of the times.In November 2009, Black &amp; Decker was acquired by Stanley Works for $4.5 billion, and the global tool company following the merger was called Stanley Black &amp; Decker (NYSE:SWK). The all-stock deal saw Stanley shareholders owning 50.5% of the combined company, with Black &amp; Decker’s shareholders owning 49.5%.In the 12 years since, SWK stock has gained just 36%. Over the same period, the index is up 233%, a more than four-fold gain. Value investors will point to the fact that SWK has fallen 63% from its May 2021 all-time high of $225, suggesting the company’s stock is severely oversold. Dividend investors will argue that this dividend king — any stock that has increased its dividend for 50 consecutive years or more — has an exceptional 3.9% yield, higher than it’s been since the financial crisis.   The problem with yield chasing is that it doesn’t fix the main issue with Stanley Black &amp; Decker, which is that its margins are terrible. In the trailing 12 months ended Oct. 1, its gross and operating margins were 27.55% and 5.12%, considerably lower than their five-year averages of 33.90% and 10.43%, respectively.SWK stock is cheap because its business is a mess. Of 19 analysts covering the company, 15 rate it as hold or worse, a sign that Wall Street isn’t convinced the company can fix what ails it. The median target price of $81 is above where it’s currently trading. This is not a stock I’d want to own heading into a possible recession. Newell Brands (NWL)A photo of a sign showing the Newell Brands (NWL) logo outside a building.Source: JHVEPhoto/Shutterstock.comOn two occasions in Newell Brands’ (NASDAQ:NWL) long and sometimes illustrious history, NWL stock has traded higher than $50. The first time was in 1998-1999. The second was in 2016-2017, not too long after announcing their purchase of Jarden in late 2015.It’s been a miserable time for long-term, buy-and-hold shareholders. It did make a brief recovery midway through 2021, but it’s down 51% since. In early December, I suggested that the company still had too many brands on its roster, and that a new CEO is a must if it is to recover from the depths it currently finds itself. In 2022, through the first nine months of the fiscal year, Newell’s sales are down 7.8%, while its operating income is off nearly 27%. The situation in the third quarter has accelerated its woes, with revenue and operating income falling 19.2% and 87.5%, respectively.Worse still, it’s burning through cash. Through the first nine months of 2021, Newell had positive cash flow of $490 million. In 2022, its cash flow is -$567 million through the end of the third quarter. This is nearly $1.1 billion worse than a year ago. So, to solve some of its operational deficiencies, it hired a new CFO. His name is Mark Erceg, and he served as CFO for at least four public companies in his 30-year business career. The man relishes a challenge. The argument for a conglomerate-style business such as Newell has always been that its heft of brands gives it more sway with the Walmarts (NYSE:WMT) and Targets (NYSE:TGT) of the world. However, the truth is that these discount retailers would gladly deal with a standalone Rubbermaid business if that’s what the customers wanted. A quick look at Newell’s 10-Q suggests that one or both of its commercial solutions (Rubbermaid) and learning and development (Sharpie, Papermate, EXPO) segments ought to be spun out into their own independent public companies. You can own Conglomerate A (Berkshire Hathaway) (NYSE:BRK-A, NYSE:BRK-B) or Conglomerate B (Newell Brands).I know which one I’d own.On the date of publication, Will Ashworth did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

However, the industry is going through a contraction period, and many former leaders are now becoming laggards.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchPictured: The big name semiconductors are beginning to lag.In the semiconductor space, there could be many reasons for such a weak period, including:1.   Macroeconomic factors:A slowing economy can lead to weakening demand.2.   Supply chain issues:In 2022, supply chain issues caused higher input costs for some semis,3.   China Lockdowns: Lockdowns in China have led to weakened global demand and production issues.Overall, the industry is subject to various factors that can impact performance. Investors can get a clearer picture of what stocks are leading and which are lagging by looking at the Zacks Ranking, consulting a chart, and sizing up the performance of the stock relative to the group.Laggards:Micron MU: After several quarters of double-digit earnings and sales growth, the semiconductor memory solutions provider saw a big slowdown in growth. Last quarter, Micron reported -40% EPS growth on -20% revenue growth. Financial results were negatively impacted by weakening consumer demand and significant inventory adjustments across all end markets. Recent EPS Estimate Revisions continue to be dropped lower, and consensus estimates anticipate the company will lose money in 2023.  Micron holds a lowly Zacks Ranking of 4 and is part of the Semiconductor Memory Industry Group which is ranked in the bottom 4% of all groups tracked by Zacks. The company is set to report earnings Wednesday.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchPictured: Recent earnings revisions have trended downward.Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) is a provider of microprocessors, media, and graphics chip sets on a similar path to Micron. In the most recent report, AMD saw its first EPS slowdown in 12 quarters. The stock holds a Zacks Rank of 3 and is stuck in a multi-month downtrend. AMD is part of the Zack’s Electronics – Semiconductors Group, which is ranked 175 out of 248. On the recent earnings call CEO Lisa Su confirmed the soft environment by saying, “Third quarter results came in below our expectations due to the softening PC market and Substantial inventory reduction actions across the PC supply chain”.Story continuesZacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchPictured: AMD's multi-year growth phase has come to an end and the stock has suffered as a result.Nvidia (NVDA) is a producer of visual computing technologies, and GPUs has unquestionably been the leader in the semiconductor industry in recent years. However, eventually, all companies succumb to higher and higher expectations – at least in the short term. While NVDA has outperformed Micron and AMD from a price-performance perspective, earnings have been disappointing. The last two quarters showed NVDA’s EPS growth slowing by 50%. NVDA currently has a Zacks ranking of 4 and failed at its 200-day moving average.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchPictured: NVDA bumped its head on the 200-day moving average and failed.Leaders:Broadcom (AVGO) isa premier designer, developer, and global supplier of a broad range of semiconductor devices. Recently AVGO reported fourth-quarter fiscal non-GAAP earnings of $10.45 per share, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimates and improving 33.8% year over year. AVGO also reported strong top-line performance, growing full-year revenues by 25.9%. Unlike the laggards mentioned above, AVGO sees strong, and consistent top and bottom-line growth, and the stock is above its 200-day moving average. Broadcom is growing at a healthier pace than its peer group, but also remains attractive on a valuation basis. Broadcom’s P/E for the trailing 12 months is 15.93, roughly in line with the 13.23 P/E for its peer group.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchPictured: AVGO has a good combination of growth and value.Impinj (PI) is a provider of referral and information network radio frequency identification solutions to retail, pharmaceutical, healthcare, food, beverage other industries. Unlike most semiconductor companies, Impinj’s technology is not primarily used in computers. Companies such as Delta Airlines (DAL), use its tiny RFID tag technology to track items (in Delta’s case, it is used to track luggage and ensure it does not get lost. Impinj holds a Zack’s Ranking of 2 and is pulling into its 50-day moving average. The stock has drastically outperformed its peer group over the past year.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchPictured: Recent EPS revisions for PI have skyrocketed as demand for its unique product offering increases.Lattice Semiconductor LSCC designs, develops, and markets high-performance programmable logic devices and related system software. Lattice’s chip technology focuses on Artificial Intelligence, a segment that is expected to see tremendous growth in the coming years. Applications for the technology include smart homes, cars, and factories. While AI is still in its infancy, the company is already producing impressive growth. EPS has grown at an impressive clip of more than 60% for three straight quarters. While LSCC holds a mediocre Zack’s Ranking of 3, it makes up for it with its ability to consistently produce upside surprises on earnings.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchPictured: LSCC has consitently beat EPS estimates and the stock has benefitted as a result.Mobileye Global Inc MBLY isthe most recent stock to go public in the semiconductor space. Mobileye’s technology looks to prevent automotive accidents, one of the leading causes of death in the United States each year. The Israel-based company has been in business for more than 20 years and is gaining momentum by inking partnerships with several leading automakers, including General Motors GM, Toyota Motor (TM), and Nio Inc NIO. The company is at the forefront of autonomous driving technology. Though MBLY is extended in price, the new issue has shown tremendous relative strength in a weak market for IPOs.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchPictured: Despite a rough market environment, MBLY has provided strong outperformance.ConclusionFor now, the semiconductor industry is a tale of the “haves” and “have-nots”. Newer, innovative companies are taking the baton from older industry stalwarts. Investors should gravitate toward companies with solid growth, expectations, and relative price strength.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

And in our experience, buying the right stocks can give your wealth a significant boost. To wit, the Air Products and Chemicals share price has climbed 92% in five years, easily topping the market return of 36% (ignoring dividends). On the other hand, the more recent gains haven't been so impressive, with shareholders gaining just 8.8% , including dividends .While the stock has fallen 3.5% this week, it's worth focusing on the longer term and seeing if the stocks historical returns have been driven by the underlying fundamentals. Check out our latest analysis for Air Products and Chemicals In his essay The Superinvestors of Graham-and-Doddsville Warren Buffett described how share prices do not always rationally reflect the value of a business. One way to examine how market sentiment has changed over time is to look at the interaction between a company's share price and its earnings per share (EPS).Over half a decade, Air Products and Chemicals managed to grow its earnings per share at 14% a year. This EPS growth is remarkably close to the 14% average annual increase in the share price. Therefore one could conclude that sentiment towards the shares hasn't morphed very much. In fact, the share price seems to largely reflect the EPS growth.The company's earnings per share (over time) is depicted in the image below (click to see the exact numbers).earnings-per-share-growthWe know that Air Products and Chemicals has improved its bottom line lately, but is it going to grow revenue? You could check out this free report showing analyst revenue forecasts.What About Dividends?As well as measuring the share price return, investors should also consider the total shareholder return (TSR). Whereas the share price return only reflects the change in the share price, the TSR includes the value of dividends (assuming they were reinvested) and the benefit of any discounted capital raising or spin-off. It's fair to say that the TSR gives a more complete picture for stocks that pay a dividend. As it happens, Air Products and Chemicals' TSR for the last 5 years was 117%, which exceeds the share price return mentioned earlier. The dividends paid by the company have thusly boosted the total shareholder return.Story continuesA Different PerspectiveIt's good to see that Air Products and Chemicals has rewarded shareholders with a total shareholder return of 8.8% in the last twelve months. Of course, that includes the dividend. Having said that, the five-year TSR of 17% a year, is even better. The pessimistic view would be that be that the stock has its best days behind it, but on the other hand the price might simply be moderating while the business itself continues to execute. It's always interesting to track share price performance over the longer term. But to understand Air Products and Chemicals better, we need to consider many other factors.

The European Union (“EU”) passenger vehicle market soared 16.3% last month to 829,527 units, marking the fourth straight month of growth this year. Registrations in Italy, Germany, Spain and France witnessed a year-over-year rise of 14.7%, 31.4%, 10.3% and 9.8%, respectively. During the first 11 months of 2022, new car registrations contracted 6.1% from the prior-year period, owing to declining registrations from January to July. During the first 11 months, all the major EU markets witnessed a decline in registrations, including Italy (11.6%), France (8.7%), Spain (4.4%) and Germany (2.4%).Leading truck engine maker Cummins Inc. CMI inked an agreement with chemical firm Linde to supply the latter 35-megawatt (MW) electrolyzer. Auto retailer AutoNation AN is set to buy RepairSmith in a $190 million deal which will enhance the former’s speed to frontline readiness and expedite deliveries to customers. AN’s close peer Lithia Motors LAD continued with its buyout spree and purchased a Stellantis dealership in Kentucky. Meanwhile, recreational vehicle (RV) maker Winnebago Industries WGO reported first-quarter fiscal 2023 results, wherein earnings fell year over year but surpassed estimates. Finally, auto equipment solutions provider Allison Transmission ALSN also made it to the top stories with its new business win in the Defense unit.Last Week’s Top StoriesCummins collaborated with Linde to supply a 35-MW proton exchange membrane (PEM) electrolyzer system to the latter’s hydrogen production plant in Niagara Falls, NY. Linde is a leader in the production and distribution of hydrogen, boasting the world’s largest liquid hydrogen capacity and distribution system. The PEM electrolyzer will be powered by hydropower to create green hydrogen for the North American market.Once operational by 2025, this hydrogen plant will be Linde’s largest in the United States.Story continuesCummins’ New Power segment president said, “This project is not only a milestone for Cummins, but also for the energy transition in the U.S.Adding the 35MW of this Linde plant to our electrolyzer project footprint highlights our commitment to scaling the green hydrogen economy and our ability to support large-scale renewable hydrogen production with market-leading innovation.” Cummins is fast adapting to the changing dynamics of the auto space. The company’s efforts to ramp up its capabilities in electrification, fuel cell and hydrogen production technology are praiseworthy.AutoNation inked a deal to acquire RepairSmith for $190 million in a bid to strengthen its after-sales business. Los Angeles-based RepairSmith is a full-service mobile solution for automotive repair and maintenance, carrying operations in the southeastern and western United States. The buyout will add another channel to AN’s after-sales business, which would not just provide service to existing customers but also introduce additional vehicle owners who have not purchased vehicles from the AutoNation dealerships. RepairSmith will offer repair and services at the customer’s preferred place, be it home, workplace or on-site.Subject to satisfactory closing conditions and regulatory approvals, the deal is scheduled to close in first-quarter 2023. The company is actively focused on expanding its business to boost its top-and bottom-line growth. This year, the company added captive financing capabilities and commenced the development of mobility solutions to bolster offerings. AN’s CEO Mike Manley said, “RepairSmith is the next step in our plan. It expands AutoNation's ability to penetrate the extensive After-Sales service market and conveniently respond to our customers’ needs by broadening the reach of our existing After-Sales network.""Lithia forayed into Kentucky with the purchase of Glenn’s Freedom CJDR (Chrysler, Dodge, Jeep, Ram) dealership in Lexington. This marks the 33rd store Lithia bought this year. It expects the dealership to generate around $140 million in annualized revenues. The acquisition is part of LAD's nationwide network expansion initiative under the company's 2025 plan, wherein it targets $50 billion in revenues and EPS in the range of $55-$60.Lithia’s strategic buyouts are helping the auto retailer increase its market share and boost its portfolio. The spree of acquisitions brought the firm’s total expected annualized revenues acquired to $7 billion in 2021, keeping it ahead of schedule laid out in the five-year plan rolled out in July 2020. Its total expected annualized revenues acquired in 2022 have reached $3.5 billion. LAD currently carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell.).You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks Rank #1 (Strong) stocks here.Winnebago reported adjusted earnings of $2.07 per share in first-quarter fiscal 2023 (ended Nov 26, 2022), which topped the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.83 on share higher-than-anticipated revenues and EBITDA from the Marine segment. The bottom line, however, plunged 41% year over year. The RV giant reported revenues of $952.2 million in the quarter under review, crossing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $899 million. Nonetheless, the top line fell 17.6% year over year.Winnebago had cash and cash equivalents of $203 million as of Nov 26, 2022. The long-term debt (excluding current maturities) increased to $590.4 million from $545.9 million recorded on Aug 27, 2022. The company approved a dividend of 27 cents a share, to be paid on Jan 25, 2023, to shareholders of record at the close of business on Jan 11, 2023.Allison clinched a contract for the X1100-3B1 transmission and tech support for the Abrams Main Battle Tank used by the U.S. Army. The value of the contract is estimated at $51 million. The agreement also entails support for Foreign Military Sales customers.Deliveries and technical support under the scope of this contract will commence in January 2023 and continue through March 2024.In recent times, Allison has recorded unprecedented growth in the global defense market. Its Defense Program vice-president Dana Pittard said, “Our internal investments have led to growth in the defense end market, with new contracts in the last six months for Abrams, the US Army’s newest light tank, mobile protected firepower, M88A3 HERCULES, and India’s future infantry combat vehicle.”Allison has long been in a niche position in developing defense propulsion solutions that function efficiently in the toughest conditions. The multiple partnerships make the company poised to provide a premium customer experience in the future.Price PerformanceThe following table shows the price movement of some of the major auto players over the last week and six-month period.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchWhat's Next in the Auto Space?Industry watchers will keep a tab on November commercial vehicle registrations to be released by the ACEA soon.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

""The game has changed. It used to be just subscribers at all cost...but now [investors] need these services to be profitable.""Bart Spiegel, partner of global entertainment &amp; media deals at PwC, added: ""We're entering a chapter two of the streaming wars.""""Only time will tell, but I think everything's on the table to try to improve profitability and make the platforms more creative to their overall business,"" he continued.Deal volumes and values in the media and telecommunications sector slowed in 2022 compared to last year's record, according to PwC's biannual U.S. Deals Outlook.Over the past 12 months ending in November, there have been 3,772 deals — a 26% year-over-year decrease — with announced deal value totaling $624 billion, an 18% dip versus 2021.This content is not available due to your privacy preferences.Update your settings here to see it.The firm attributed the slowdown to higher interest rates and inflation, coupled with growing geopolitical tensions and regulatory oversight.The FTC's recent antitrust lawsuit against Microsoft (MSFT) and its $69 billion acquisition of “Call of Duty” publisher Activision Blizzard (ATVI) and Paramount's (PARA) blocked sale of Simon and Schuster serve as the latest examples of this more combative regulatory environment.The Microsoft-Activision deal, along with Elon Musk's $44 billion Twitter takeover, were the two largest deals announced in the media and telecom space this year.The report included all deals announced in 2022 — regardless of whether or not they closed. Amazon's $8.5 billion acquisition of MGM and WarnerMedia's $43 billion merger with Discovery did not count toward this year's total as they were announced prior to 2022.Story continues'Consolidation will happen'Paramount CEO Bob Bakish doubled down on consolidation, more M&amp;A in mediaAmid this shifting landscape, media executives have floated merger and consolidation possibilities.Paramount CEO Bob Bakish recently revealing during a UBS media conference earlier this month: ""Consolidation has been the rule in business for a long time, certainly been the rule in media. So, it’s hard for me to bet on anything other than consolidation will happen in the future.""Jason Kilar, former CEO of WarnerMedia and the founding CEO of Hulu, wrote in a Wall Street Journal op-ed published earlier this month he expects, ""two or three major mergers and/or acquisitions involving entertainment companies in the coming 24 months"" as cash flow challenges deepen.Streaming losses have mounted in recent years as the cost of content continues to skyrocket.Disney's (DIS) direct-to-consumer division shed a whopping $4 billion-plus in its fiscal 2022, which ended on October 1, while Paramount guided streaming losses would total about $1.8 billion this year — higher than Wall Street expectations.Warner Bros. Discovery (WBD), which has slashed its market cap in half amid its messy restructuring efforts, reported free cash flow of negative $192 million in the third quarter, compared to $705 million in the year prior. The company now plans to take on $3.5 billion in content impairment and development write-offs by 2024.As WBD struggles for direction, many industry insiders believe the embattled company will sell again — making it a possible acquisition target in 2023 and beyond.Another asset for sale will be Lionsgate's film and TV studio, which the entertainment giant plans to spin off into a separate company, while AMC Networks (AMCX) continues to undergo a restructuring that could result in a sale.Needham's Laura Martin wrote in a recent client note Paramount could be attractive to unload, while smaller players like WWE (WWE), Curiosity Stream (CURIW), and Chicken Soup for the Soul (CSSE) will likely sell due to their size.Disney CEO Bob Iger will also face a slew of decisions — including what to do with notable assets like Hulu (sell it to Comcast?) and ESPN (spin it off?).Disney's Chief Executive Officer Bob Iger speaks during the Bloomberg Global Business Forum in New York City, New York, U.S., September 25, 2019. REUTERS/Shannon Stapleton""There's definitely going to be assets for sale in the market,"" Mary Ann Halford, partner at Altman Solon, said. ""The bigger question is: What do we see coming out of the very large media companies? And we've also seen that the tech giants have been rather slow to scoop up these assets.""As for tech behemoth Amazon (AMZN), Amazon CEO Andy Jassy said in an interview at The New York Times' Dealbook Summit last month, ""I do think over time we have opportunities to make our Prime Video business a standalone business with very attractive economics.""""Customers would like to go to a place and find everything they want, they don’t want to go to 5 or 6 different places,"" Jassy said.What will drive M&amp;A?PwC noted demand for live sports, including sports-adjacent industries like sports gambling, will likely drive future M&amp;A activity.""There is so much money in sports, and getting live sports onto the streaming platforms is an area that is still not completely tapped,"" Qvest's Christian said. ""The question there is: Can they put a pencil to it? Because the price is so high for the content. Are they now going to be able to get the subscribers necessary to be profitable in that business?""Spiegel agreed that rising content costs will likely pressure future dealmaking, although more disciplined content spend could force platforms to partner up in order to offset production risks.Amazon Thursday Night Football analysts prepare for a pregame live shot before the football game between the Philadelphia Eagles and Houston Texans at NRG Stadium on November 3, 2022 in Houston, TX. (Photo by Ken Murray/Icon Sportswire via Getty Images)Other M&amp;A opportunities could revolve around movie theaters, as box office ticket sales struggle to reach pre-pandemic levels, and video games, which provide lucrative monetization opportunities through franchise intellectual property (IP).""A lot of these media companies are relying on their existing IP to monetize in the market across geographies and windows, as opposed to investing heavily and creating new IP,"" Spiegel said, citing profitability concerns. ""More traditional video game companies have that IP [and] also have the engines and technologies that help in the content creation process.""Overall, though, the biggest M&amp;A opportunity will be content — especially as consumers become more choosy with their subscription plans.""Content and IP will always be attractive, because, not only is there a direct ability to monetize that existing content, IP, or library, but also the tangential opportunities to monetize through sequels or other types of storylines,"" Spiegel said.""You can look at so many different things, but you need to have quality content,"" Christian added. ""Content is always going to be king.""'It's a tough world for financing'As recession concerns weigh on investor sentiment heading into the new year, PwC predicated a negative impact on valuations.""It's a tough world for financing so [private equity] is more sitting on the sidelines right now,"" Spiegel said.""There's likely going to be a gap between what sellers expect for the valuation of their properties, versus what buyers are willing to pay, because you have a diminished buyer pool and the access to financing is much more expensive,"" he said.Still, ""I do expect private equity will return — they're sitting on a significant amount of dry powder, but we just have to wait for the markets to come back in their favor.""Altman Solon's Halford added higher interest rates will fuel macro challenges after the Federal Reserve delivered investors its seventh and final interest rate increase of 2022.""When people are looking to buy out something with equity and debt, the interest rate environment is definitely a headwind,"" Halford said.However, Halford said there will still be assets for sale next year, even with these challenges: ""Wall Street is going to be on [these companies'] tails.""This content is not available due to your privacy preferences.Update your settings here to see it.Alexandra is a Senior Entertainment and Media Reporter at Yahoo Finance.

Some of the most well-known companies had a tough 2022, with Disney DIS and Netflix NFLX being two that stuck out.Let’s see what’s going on with the entertainment titans as we move closer to the new year.Recent Developments Long-term Disney CEO Bob Iger returned to the helms in November after briefly retiring from the company. Before retirement, Iger more recently served as Executive Chairman but came back to his more active CEO role at the request of the board of directors.Iger returned after fears that the company and stock would continue falling in his absence. Even amid the surprising but very welcome return for Wall Street, Disney stock is back near its 52-week lows seen in November.Meanwhile, Netflix has seen some recent volatility as well with the launch of its much-anticipated paid ad service not going as well as planned. News of Netflix missing 20% of its ad targets caused the stock to sell off last week after advertisers reportedly asked that the company return some of the money already paid for advertising slots.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchPerformance &amp; Valuation Year to date, Disney’s stock is down -44% Vs. Netflix’s -52%. DIS and NFLX stock has underperformed the S&amp;P 500’s -19% and the Media Conglomerate Markets -37%. Over the last decade, NFLX is still up an astonishing +2,105% to crush DIS’s +71% and the benchmark. Both stocks have outperformed their Zacks Subindustry’s +9%, but Disney lagged the broader market.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchTrading around $85 per share and roughly 46% from its highs, Disney has a forward P/E of 22.1X. In comparison, Netflix is 53% off its high at around $288 a share and trades at 28.2X forward earnings.Disney trades 83% below its decade high of 134.43X and slightly above its median of 19.7X. When comparing this period, Netflix looks much more attractive trading well below its decade high of 2,585X and also at a 74% discount to its median of 110.1X.Story continuesGrowthDisney earnings are now expected to jump 15% in its current fiscal year 2023 and climb another 31% in FY24 at $5.34 per share. However, earnings estimate revisions have largely gone down over the last 90 days attributed to operating losses among its streaming segments Disney+ and ESPN+.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchSales are forecasted to rise 10% in FY23 and another 6% in FY24 to $96.61 billion. Fiscal 2024 would be a 25% increase from pre-pandemic levels with 2019 sales at $69.57 billion.Look at Netflix, earnings are projected to drop -8% in 2022 and rise 3% in fiscal 2023 at $10.67 per share. Earnings estimates are slightly up for FY22 but have trended down for FY23.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchOn the top line, Netflix’s sales are expected to be up 6% this year and jump another 7% in FY23 to $33.92 billion. FY23 would represent 68% growth from pre-pandemic levels with 2019 sales at $20.15 billion.Bottom Line &amp; Takeaway Netflix’s historical performance and valuation could be an indication that the stock is more poised for a 2023 rebound than Disney. Despite Disney’s expected bottom line growth in its FY23 and FY24, earnings estimate revisions have continued to largely trend down for both years landing the stock a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) at the moment.On the other hand, earnings estimate revisions have started to go up in Netflix’s FY22 with the stock currently landing a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). Netflix also appears to be the better long-term choice at the moment for 2023 and beyond as indicated in its top-line growth despite short-term headwinds with its paid ad business.

The funds will help MEEA further collaborate with ComEd, Nicor Gas, Peoples Gas and North Shore Gas on an ongoing program to rehabilitate the homes of low-income residents so that they can receive energy-efficiency improvements and services that can lower monthly energy bills.""MEEA is honored to partner with the Federal Home Loan Bank, Providence Bank and Illinois utilities to address a problem facing so many homeowners. This braided funding will help make these homes safer and more energy efficient, so the residents can save money on their utility bills,"" said Stacey Paradis, MEEA Executive Director.Cook County homeowners who qualify for upgrades must have total household incomes at or below 60% of the Area Median Income which for a family of four is $62,520. The homes must also have identified structural or health and safety issues that need to be addressed before energy-efficiency improvements and services can be safely completed.For ComEd customers, improvements and services are part of the award-winning ComEd Energy Efficiency program which, since 2008, has saved participating families and businesses more than $7 billion on their electric bills and helped remove the same amount of carbon emissions from the air equivalent to planting more than 30 million acres of trees.""The ability to assist more low-income homes supports ComEd’s focus on equity for all customers,"" said Melissa Washington, ComEd's chief customer officer and senior vice president of customer operations. ""These homes tend to be older in design, with structural, health and safety issues, such as water leaks, that must be addressed before energy-efficiency technologies can be installed. Improvements to these homes means more families can take advantage of programs that help them save energy and manage bills through the life of their homes.""Story continuesThe FHLBank Chicago grants awarded to MEEA, in partnership with Providence Bank, are among 35 totaling $20.6 million. They are designed to support the acquisition, rehabilitation and new construction of more than 1,600 housing units across Illinois and Wisconsin. MEEA’s application was submitted in partnership with ComEd, Nicor Gas, Peoples Gas and North Shore Gas.With the FHLBank Chicago grants, MEEA and the utilities will be able to invest approximately $20,000 in services to each low-income home.

But others argue splitting the jobs can cause confusion over who is in charge.California Public Employees' Retirement System, the largest U.S. pension fund, objects to combining the roles, while BlackRock, the world's largest asset manager, does not, said securities law professor Ann Lipton of Tulane University School of Law.When the roles are combined, Blackrock would also like boards to have a lead independent director with certain substantive powers, she said.Around 45% of public companies have dual CEO/chairperson roles, said Yale School of Management professor Jeffrey Sonnenfeld.Story continues""Despite public media discussion, there is NO research that indicates that the separation of roles led to superior performance or better governance,"" he said in an email.Intercontinental Exchange Inc, CME Group Inc and Cboe Global Markets Inc also have CEOs holding chairperson titles.(Reporting by Niket Nishant and Anirban Chakroborti in Bengaluru and John McCrank in New York; Editing by Anil D'Silva, Richard Chang and David Evans)]"

Typically, we'll want to notice a trend of growing return on capital employed (ROCE) and alongside that, an expanding base of capital employed. Basically this means that a company has profitable initiatives that it can continue to reinvest in, which is a trait of a compounding machine. Looking at Colgate-Palmolive (NYSE:CL), it does have a high ROCE right now, but lets see how returns are trending.Return On Capital Employed (ROCE): What Is It?Just to clarify if you're unsure, ROCE is a metric for evaluating how much pre-tax income (in percentage terms) a company earns on the capital invested in its business. The formula for this calculation on Colgate-Palmolive is:Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)0.31 = US$3.6b ÷ (US$16b - US$4.5b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to September 2022).Thus, Colgate-Palmolive has an ROCE of 31%.  That's a fantastic return and not only that, it outpaces the average of 14% earned by companies in a similar industry. Check out our latest analysis for Colgate-Palmolive roceIn the above chart we have measured Colgate-Palmolive's prior ROCE against its prior performance, but the future is arguably more important. If you're interested, you can view the analysts predictions in our free report on analyst forecasts for the company.The Trend Of ROCEIn terms of Colgate-Palmolive's historical ROCE movements, the trend isn't fantastic. While it's comforting that the ROCE is high, five years ago it was 44%. On the other hand, the company has been employing more capital without a corresponding improvement in sales in the last year, which could suggest these investments are longer term plays. It's worth keeping an eye on the company's earnings from here on to see if these investments do end up contributing to the bottom line.What We Can Learn From Colgate-Palmolive's ROCETo conclude, we've found that Colgate-Palmolive is reinvesting in the business, but returns have been falling. And with the stock having returned a mere 16% in the last five years to shareholders, you could argue that they're aware of these lackluster trends. So if you're looking for a multi-bagger, the underlying trends indicate you may have better chances elsewhere.Story continuesIf you want to continue researching Colgate-Palmolive, you might be interested to know about the 1 warning sign that our analysis has discovered.If you'd like to see other companies earning high returns, check out our free list of companies earning high returns with solid balance sheets here.Have feedback on this article?

Although, it's not wise to just take the P/E at face value as there may be an explanation why it's so lofty.Comcast hasn't been tracking well recently as its declining earnings compare poorly to other companies, which have seen some growth on average. One possibility is that the P/E is high because investors think this poor earnings performance will turn the corner. If not, then existing shareholders may be extremely nervous about the viability of the share price. See our latest analysis for Comcast peKeen to find out how analysts think Comcast's future stacks up against the industry? In that case, our free report is a great place to start.Is There Enough Growth For Comcast?There's an inherent assumption that a company should far outperform the market for P/E ratios like Comcast's to be considered reasonable.Retrospectively, the last year delivered a frustrating 62% decrease to the company's bottom line. As a result, earnings from three years ago have also fallen 54% overall. So unfortunately, we have to acknowledge that the company has not done a great job of growing earnings over that time.Turning to the outlook, the next three years should generate growth of 51% per year as estimated by the analysts watching the company. Meanwhile, the rest of the market is forecast to only expand by 9.2% each year, which is noticeably less attractive.With this information, we can see why Comcast is trading at such a high P/E compared to the market. It seems most investors are expecting this strong future growth and are willing to pay more for the stock.The Final WordIt's argued the price-to-earnings ratio is an inferior measure of value within certain industries, but it can be a powerful business sentiment indicator.Story continuesAs we suspected, our examination of Comcast's analyst forecasts revealed that its superior earnings outlook is contributing to its high P/E. Right now shareholders are comfortable with the P/E as they are quite confident future earnings aren't under threat. It's hard to see the share price falling strongly in the near future under these circumstances.Plus, you should also learn about these   4 warning signs we've spotted with Comcast.Of course, you might also be able to find a better stock than Comcast. So you may wish to see this free collection of other companies that sit on P/E's below 20x and have grown earnings strongly.Have feedback on this article? Concerned about the content?

(NYSE:PRU) down to US$36b market cap, but institutional owners may not be as affected after a year of 0.8% returns",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/prudential-financial-inc-nyse-pru-143539445.html,1671460539,STORY,['PRU'],"[If you want to know who really controls Prudential Financial, Inc. (NYSE:PRU), then you'll have to look at the makeup of its share registry. With 59% stake, institutions possess the maximum shares in the company. Put another way, the group faces the maximum upside potential (or downside risk).Institutional investors endured the highest losses after the company's market cap fell by US$1.7b last week. However, the 0.8% one-year return to shareholders might have softened the blow. They should, however, be mindful of further losses in the future.Let's take a closer look to see what the different types of shareholders can tell us about Prudential Financial. See our latest analysis for Prudential Financial ownership-breakdownWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Prudential Financial?Many institutions measure their performance against an index that approximates the local market. So they usually pay more attention to companies that are included in major indices.Prudential Financial already has institutions on the share registry. Indeed, they own a respectable stake in the company. This implies the analysts working for those institutions have looked at the stock and they like it. But just like anyone else, they could be wrong. If multiple institutions change their view on a stock at the same time, you could see the share price drop fast. It's therefore worth looking at Prudential Financial's earnings history below. Of course, the future is what really matters.earnings-and-revenue-growthInstitutional investors own over 50% of the company, so together than can probably strongly influence board decisions. Prudential Financial is not owned by hedge funds. Our data shows that BlackRock, Inc. is the largest shareholder with 9.0% of shares outstanding. Meanwhile, the second and third largest shareholders, hold 8.6% and 4.8%, of the shares outstanding, respectively.On studying our ownership data, we found that 25 of the top shareholders collectively own less than 50% of the share register, implying that no single individual has a majority interest.Story continuesWhile it makes sense to study institutional ownership data for a company, it also makes sense to study analyst sentiments to know which way the wind is blowing. Quite a few analysts cover the stock, so you could look into forecast growth quite easily.Insider Ownership Of Prudential FinancialWhile the precise definition of an insider can be subjective, almost everyone considers board members to be insiders. Company management run the business, but the CEO will answer to the board, even if he or she is a member of it.Most consider insider ownership a positive because it can indicate the board is well aligned with other shareholders. However, on some occasions too much power is concentrated within this group.Our data suggests that insiders own under 1% of Prudential Financial, Inc. in their own names. Being so large, we would not expect insiders to own a large proportion of the stock. Collectively, they own US$45m of stock. It is good to see board members owning shares, but it might be worth checking if those insiders have been buying. General Public OwnershipThe general public-- including retail investors -- own 41% stake in the company, and hence can't easily be ignored. While this group can't necessarily call the shots, it can certainly have a real influence on how the company is run.Next Steps:While it is well worth considering the different groups that own a company, there are other factors that are even more important. Case in point: We've spotted   4 warning signs for Prudential Financial  you should be aware of.If you are like me, you may want to think about whether this company will grow or shrink. Luckily, you can check this free report showing analyst forecasts for its future.NB: Figures in this article are calculated using data from the last twelve months, which refer to the 12-month period ending on the last date of the month the financial statement is dated.

The stock has been one of the primary breadwinners for energy investors since the turn of the year after capitalizing on global energy shortages with its streamlined, vertically integrated business model. However, times have clearly changed, and as a result, investors have backed out of stock abruptly.Warning! GuruFocus has detected 2 Warning Sign with DVN. Click here to check it out. DVN 15-Year Financial DataThe intrinsic value of DVNPeter Lynch Chart of DVNTop to bottom outlookA top to bottom analysis reveals Devon Energy's vulnerability. The company operates in a cyclical industry, meaning its stock exhibits excess volatility to the economic cycle. There's a strong possibility that we might enter a recession during 2023. Features such as resilient inflation, unstable monetary policy, the war in Ukraine, stagnating industrial production in Europe and hyperinflation in emerging markets such as Turkey and Argentina could ignite an economic spiral. Moreover, the yield curve's inversion suggests the financial markets anticipate a recession as the curve implies that spot rates will need to settle below equilibrium to reignite long-term economic growth.Will Devon Energy Recover After Its Recent Drawdown?The oil and gas space has started feeling the symptoms of economic troubles already now that the temporary price boom from Russia sanctions has faded. For example, during the past week, U.S. drillers have cut the most rigs since September. In addition, oil prices have touched January lows, suggesting the market expects a gross supply surplus to surface sometime in 2023.Operational updateDevon Energy beat its third-quarter earnings target by five cents per share. However, a 20 cents per share dividend cut squandered the good news. The financial markets usually interpret dividend cuts as bad news because of the belief that dividend policies are a primary indicator of a company's future financial performance.Story continuesThe company's third-quarter earnings reached $1.9 billion due to a production increase of 1% year-over-year. In addition, the company's operating cash flows grew by 32% year-over-year. Lastly, the fourth-quarter guidance calls for between 640,000 and 660,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, which is 2% lower than Cohen's midpoint estimate.All in all, Devon Energy is struggling with rising input costs and potential demand destruction, which is a normal occurrence for a cyclical enterprise.Gurus and insidersGuruFocus' Guru Trades and Insider Trades features paint a contrasting picture. The Guru Trades page suggests Wall Street's whales are bullish on the stock as the likes of Joel Greenblatt (Trades, Portfolio) and Ken Fisher (Trades, Portfolio) have recently added the asset to their portfolios. Observing Guru Trades is a helpful indicator from a short to medium-term vantage point but should always be looked at in collaboration with other variables. Moreover, it comes from the backwards-looking 13F documents.Investors should be aware that 13F reports do not provide a complete picture of a gurus holdings. They include only a snapshot of long equity positions in U.S.-listed stocks and American depository receipts as of the quarters end. They do not include short positions, non-ADR international holdings or other types of securities. However, even this limited filing can provide valuable information.Will Devon Energy Recover After Its Recent Drawdown?On the other end of the spectrum, Devon Energy's insider trading pattern is pointing downward. The company's insider sells exhibit dominance, which could suggest one of two things. Firstly, management might be pessimistic about the company's near-term financial prospects. Or alternatively, contingent claims were triggered, causing a mass insider sell-off. However, investors should also note that insiders could just be selling because they want to take the cash for personal use. What's more concerning is the lack of recent insider buys.Will Devon Energy Recover After Its Recent Drawdown?Valuation, dividend and volatility analysisGuruFocus' free cash flow-based discounted cash flow calculation indicates that Devon Energy is marginally undervalued when using a discount rate of 10%, a 10-year growth rate of 5% and a terminal growth rate of 4%. The company's discount rate has likely peaked amid a potential interest rate pivot and receding credit spreads. However, economic uncertainty going into 2023 could sustain its elevated equity risk premium.Will Devon Energy Recover After Its Recent Drawdown?Assessing a natural resource company's value requires consideration of its book value. Natural resource companies' book values are considered more accurate as their inventory is quoted and traded on public exchanges. In addition, they often host many long-life assets, which are regularly tested for impairment.Devon Energy's stock is trading at 3.61 times its book value, which poses a concern if you're a value-orientated investor. Moreover, the stock is trading at an enterprise-to-forward-revenue premium of 3.25, which is substantially higher than its normalized number of 1.37.As previously mentioned, Devon Energy recently decided to trim its dividend payout due to elevated cost concerns. Nonetheless, the stock's forward dividend yield remains at 8.98%, which is better than 81.56% of its sector peers. Furthermore, the company's 65.32% return on equity indicates it can deliver dividends with minimal effort.Devon Energy's dividend profile could be a significant value-add to total returns, in turn luring a larger investor base. However, investors must consider that high dividend payouts won't necessarily phase out price risk if a recession were to unfold.Concluding thoughtsAs a long-time Devon Energy bull, I've changed my narrative to a more cautious outlook, as recession risk could alter the stock's medium-term prospects.Devon Energy's dividend cut signals unwanted convergence between the top line and costs. Furthermore, the stock is trading at a significant premium to its book value, indicating it has reached a cyclical peak.Will Devon Energy resume its recent drawdown? Nothing is for sure in the financial markets; however, the stock's prospects look increasingly undesirable to me.This article first appeared on GuruFocus.]"

The rotary rig count, issued by BKR, is usually published in major newspapers and trade publications.Baker Hughes’ data, issued at the end of every week since 1944, helps energy service providers gauge the overall business environment of the oil and gas industry. The number of active rigs and its comparison with the prior-week figure indicates the demand trajectory for Baker Hughes’ oilfield services from exploration and production companies.DetailsTotal U.S. Rig Count Falls: The count of rigs engaged in the exploration and production of oil and natural gas in the United States was 776 for the week ended Dec 16. The figure is lower thanthe prior week's count of 780. Thus, the tally increased in six of the prior 10 weeks. The current national rig count is higher than the year-ago level of 579.The onshore rigs in the week ended Dec 16 totaled 759, lower than the prior-week count of 760. In offshore resources, 15 rigs were operating, lower than the prior week’s count of 18.U.S. Oil Rig Count Declines: The oil rig count was 620 for the week ended Dec 16, lower than the prior-week figure of 625. The current number of oil rigs — far from the peak of 1,609 attained in October 2014 — is, however, up from the year-ago figure of 475.U.S. Natural Gas Rig Count Rises: Natural gas rig count of 154 was higher than the prior-week figure of 153. The count of rigs exploring the commodity is higher than the prior-year week’s tally of 104. Per the latest report, the number of natural gas-directed rigs is 90.4% lower than the all-time high of 1,606 recorded in 2008.Rig Count by Type: The number of vertical drilling rigs totaled 26 units, in line with the prior-week count. The horizontal/directional rig count (encompassing new drilling technology with the ability to drill and extract gas from dense rock formations, also known as shale formations) of 750 is lower than the prior-week level of 754.Story continuesGulf of Mexico (GoM) Rig Count Declines: GoM rig count was 15 units, all oil-directed. The count was lower than the prior-week number of 18.Rig Count in the Most Prolific BasinPermian — the most prolific basin in the United States — recorded a weekly oil rig tally of 347, higher than the prior week's count of 346. The tally increased in five of the prior 10 weeks.OutlookThe West Texas Intermediate crude price is trading at more than the $70-per-barrel mark, which is still highly favorable for exploration and production activities. Solid oil prices will likely pave the way for rig additions despite a slowdown in drilling activities, as upstream players mainly focus on stockholder returns rather than boosting output.Investors may keep a close eye on energy stocks like EOG Resources EOG and Devon Energy Corporation DVN, as these companies are expected to benefit from the current healthy oil price scenario.EOG Resources, currently carrying a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), is a leading oil and natural gas exploration and production company. It is well-placed to capitalize on the promising business scenario. It has an estimated 11,500 net undrilled premium locations, resulting in a brightened production outlook. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.EOG Resources is strongly committed to returning capital to shareholders. Since it transitioned to premium drilling, the company has returned $10.4 billion in cash to stockholders. With the employment of premium drilling, EOG can reduce its cash operating costs per barrel of oil equivalent, thereby aiding its bottom line.Devon Energy is a well-known upstream energy firm with a strong multi-basin portfolio. Delaware basin is among the basins that contribute significant oil equivalent production to DVN.The Zacks Rank #3 firm, Devon Energy, has a prolific multi-decade inventory, posing a solid production outlook.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the bottom line stands at a loss of 2 cents per share and has been revised downward by a couple of cents in the past seven days. The consensus mark indicates a drastic decline from the year-ago quarter’s earnings of $2.16 per share.Meanwhile, Micron estimates revenues of $4.25 billion (+/- $250 million). The consensus mark for revenues is pegged at $4.08 billion, suggesting a 46.9% decrease from the year-earlier period’s revenues of $7.69 billion.The company’s earnings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in the trailing four quarters, the average surprise being 5.6%.Let’s see how things have shaped up before this announcement.Micron Technology, Inc. Price and EPS SurpriseMicron Technology, Inc. Price and EPS SurpriseMicron Technology, Inc. price-eps-surprise | Micron Technology, Inc. QuoteFactors at PlayMicron’s overall first-quarter performance is likely to have been negatively impacted by soft consumer spending due to rising inflationary pressure and growing concerns over the global economic slowdown. Softened consumer spending has resulted in weak memory chip demand from the smartphone and personal computer end markets.Substantial customer inventory adjustments across end markets are expected to have hurt the overall financial performance in the first quarter. Data center operators are adjusting their memory and storage purchases due to the shortage of other components as well as reducing their inventories amid ongoing macroeconomic uncertainties.Industry-wide component supply constraints across the automotive and industrial end markets are expected to have hurt Micron’s top and bottom lines in the first quarter. The company expects a slowdown in its automotive end market demand as customers are rebalancing DRAM and NAND inventory levels to deal with non-memory semiconductor shortages and production challenges.Story continuesMoreover, MU’s industrial end market customers are adjusting their DRAM and NAND memory chip purchases amid soft macroeconomic conditions.The memory chip maker’s heavy dependence on China is a headwind due to the ongoing tit-for-tat trade spat between the United States and China. Additionally, a higher mix of lower-margin NAND, coupled with low memory prices and a minimal decline in manufacturing costs, is expected to have strained margins.What Our Model SaysOur proven model does not conclusively predict an earnings beat for Micron this season. The combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) increases the chances of an earnings beat. However, that’s not the case here.Micron currently carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) and has an Earnings ESP of -350.00%.

(Nasdaq: AVDX), a leading provider of accounts payable (AP) automation software and payment solutions for middle market businesses and their suppliers, today announced the appointment of two new Board members: Sonali Sambhus and Asif Ramji. The addition of these two seasoned executives with a broad portfolio of experience across software and payments complexes enhances the Board’s insights around product, platform and automation initiatives.“I am delighted to welcome such high caliber talent as Sonali and Asif join the distinguished AvidXchange Board. As we continue to execute on our product and platform roadmap, we look forward to leveraging their industry knowledge and insights in driving AvidXchange forward and seeking to unlock shareholder value for our investors,” said Co-founder, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Michael Praeger.Asif brings a wealth of experience through his various senior leadership roles across the payments and software ecosystem. He is currently the Founder and Chief Executive Officer at Venture Worx (a private advisory and investment management firm) and previously served as the Chief Growth Officer and Chief Product Officer at FIS (NYSE: FIS). Prior to joining FIS, he led teams in an executive capacity at Worldpay, Vantiv, and Paymetric where he served as president &amp; CEO. Asif has also been recognized by EY as a national Entrepreneur of the Year award recipient for financial services.“In my two decades of seeing various business models in the payments and software space, I am truly impressed with what AvidXchange has created. It has become a leader in the mid-market accounts payable automation and payments solutions space,” remarked Asif Ramji.Sonali is a technology innovator and has over two-decades-plus experience in spearheading technology strategies and innovations across diverse industries. Until recently, she served as head of the Developer &amp; ML (machine learning) Platform at Block, Inc. (formerly Square) driving industry leading transformation and platform growth. Previously, she held executive roles at relator.com and Vuclip, Inc. (acquired by PCCW Limited). Sonali was also the co-founder of 10jumps Inc., a data analytics startup which was acquired by Saggezza Inc.

Sonali received her MS in Computer Engineering from Rutgers University in 1999 and has earned a graduate certificate from the George Washington University School of Business and a Fintech Frameworks certification from the University of California, Berkley.Story continues“Based on my diligence, AvidXchange is a truly scarce asset, targeting the mid-market B2B AP automation and payments space. Its differentiated business model, solid balance sheet and strong financial performance distinguish it from its peers. With a deep understanding of what it takes to stand and drive a scalable technology platform, I believe that AvidXchange has the technology, talent, roadmap and scale to capitalize on the huge opportunity in the underserved middle market accounts payable automation and payments solutions area,” said Sonali Sambhus.Concurrent with the aforementioned additions, AvidXchange announced that Nigel Morris and Hans Morris (no relation) have resigned from the Board and any committees on which they served, effective December 15, 2022. The resignations were motivated, in part, by achievement of the Company’s initial public offering milestone and, in part, to provide them with additional time to pursue their other business interests. Both joined the AvidXchange Board in 2015 in connection with their investment in the Company’s institutional capital raise.Neither Nigel Morris’ nor Hans Morris’ resignation is the result of any disagreement with the Company on any matter related to the Company’s operations, policies or practices.“On behalf of the Board of Directors, I want to thank Nigel and Hans for their insight, dedication and impactful contributions. Since joining in 2015, their knowledge and credibility enabled us to raise capital, execute our product focus, pursue inorganic growth and execute our Initial Public Offering. Nigel’s domain expertise in the area of vendor financing led to the first generation of our invoice accelerator product. While Hans was instrumental in providing the insight and foundational guidance in pursuing mergers and acquisitions as well as preparing for our public markets debut. Both played a major role in the success that is AvidXchange today, and I am forever grateful to them for their support,” commented Michael Praeger.About AvidXchange™AvidXchange is a leading provider of accounts payable (“AP”) automation software and payment solutions for middle market businesses and their suppliers.

For more companies, head on over to 5 Countries That Produce the Best Coffee in the World. Coffee is one of the most popular beverages in the world, and one with a long history, with the first mention of the drink tracing its way back to the tenth century CE. Since then, it has been used for its medicinal properties that helped with concentration and as a social activity to allow people to congregate at coffee shops. Global coffee consumption is booming, and according to estimates by the International Coffee Organization (ICO) consumption in the twelve months that ended in September 2022 is slated to sit at a whopping 170.3 million bags. However, despite this, a global coffee shortfall will continue, with a production of 167.2 million bags expected to stay behind the consumption.Automation and industrial engineering are changing the way farmers plant, monitor, and harvest their products, and the coffee industry is no exception. For instance, coffee farmers in Brazil are employing automation throughout the planting and harvesting processes. The machines that harvest coffee use the global positioning system (GPS) to allow farmers to keep track of the equipment and cameras to analyze the plant. Of course, this is just rudimentary technology compared to today's standards, and leading edge research into coffee production is now studying hyperspectral imaging for a variety of purposes. For instance, researchers have shown that a visible near (VIS-NIR) infrared sensor can be used to map out coffee plants to inspect them for insect damage.What's more is that this research also uses algorithms to let computers pick out the relevant damage patterns through just three image bands, with the initial subset of bands being selected through principle component analysis (PCA) - a basic type of machine learning. The same imaging processes can also be used to map out different coffee bean varieties, removing a large burden from farmers who previously had to crush the bean to find out its type and kind. In fact, coffee bean spectral imaging has been shown to achieve an 80% accuracy in identifying the right kind of bean. The use of technology to aid farmers with their quality gauging needs has also been commercialized, with Colombian firm Demetria providing farmers the tools to map out their bean profile with infrared light and then determine which bean they have come across through using an artificial intelligence platform. The company also provides technology that allows farmers to sift out high quality coffee bean stems by using handheld gadgets. The firm raised $3 million in 2021 to allow it to develop an automated platform for mapping out coffee beans based on acidity, flavor, and aroma by creating digital footprints.Story continuesAs far as the overall market goes, ICO estimates that global coffee exports stood at 9.7 million bags in October this year, marking a drop from the 9.87 bags exported in October 2021. According to Expert Market Research, the global coffee market was worth $114 billion in 2020 and it will grow at a compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) of 4.8% between 2018 to 2022. Out of the different product categories, the research firm estimates that instant coffee will hold the greatest market share, not only because it is easy and less time consuming to prepare, but also because it is good for metabolism and contains relatively lower amounts of caffeine. The research firm further outlines that increasing awareness of coffee's health benefits and a shift toward sustainable innovations for delivery will stimulate growth. Leading coffee producers and sellers are Starbucks Corporation (NASDAQ:SBUX), Monster Beverage Corporation (NASDAQ:MNST), McDonald’s Corporation (NYSE:MCD), The Kraft Heinz Company (NASDAQ:KHC), The J.M. Smucker Company (NYSE:SJM), and Nestlé S.A. (SWX:NESN.SW).Our Methodology We used global trade data segregated on the basis of the harmonized tariff schedule to see which countries export the best coffee. Overall, this data agrees with the ICO's assessment that coffee exports are declining, with the $36 billion of exports in 2021 falling by $144 million annually.Countries That Produce the Best Coffee in the World12. Netherlands Coffee Exports in 2021: $906 millionThe Netherlands is a European country with a $10.6 billion coffee market in 2020. The largest portion of the Dutch coffee market is the filtered coffee market with coffee capsules coming in second place. Additionally, the Dutch coffee market is expected to grow to $13 billion in 2027. The country is also known for its popular coffee shops, which are known globally for allowing visitors to legally consume cannabis in addition to coffee as well. Perhaps the most famous Dutch coffee brand is JDE Peet's N.V. (AMS:JDEP.AS)'s Douwe Egberts coffee. Douwe Egberts is one of the oldest coffee brands in the world, as it was initially set up in 1753 in the Netherlands. The Dutch have also played a vital role in the globalization of coffee, as they were one of the first to sell it out of the Middle East despite governments trying their best to prevent exports. The Netherlands exported $906 million of coffee in 2021, for 127,077 tons.11. Republic of Guatemala Coffee Exports in 2021: $928 millionThe Republic of Guatemala is a Central American country that is also the most populous in the region. Coffee plays a vital role in the country's economy, as it often ranks as its second largest export. The industry itself consists mostly of small farmers so much so that large growers often find themselves squeezed out due to poor profit margins. 96% of Guatemalan production in 2021 was of Arabica coffee beans. Some top coffee producing regions in the country are Nueva Oriente, San Marcos, and Huehuetenango - with the last being one of the highest coffee producing regions in the world at an altitude of 6,500 feet. Guatemalan coffee is used by big brands such as Starbucks Corporation (NASDAQ:SBUX) at its locations, particularly in the United States.10. Kingdom of Belgium Coffee Exports in 2021: $1 billionThe Kingdom of Belgium, or simply Belgium, is one of the most prosperous nations in the world with high standards of living. According to research from the European Union, the country was Europe's third largest importer of green coffee as of 2021. This is coffee that is an extract from unroasted coffee beans. Belgium's Port of Antwerp is capable of storing a whopping 250,000 tons of coffee - unsurprising since Belgium alone exported 296,050 tons of coffee in 2021. The country's coffee industry was worth $3.5 billion in 2022, and it is expected to grow at a CAGR of 8.34% by 2025. One of Belgium's largest and oldest coffee companies is the Miko NV (EBR:MIKO.BR), which traces its roots back to the 1900s and is headquartered in Turnhout.As coffee consumption in Europe grows, companies like Starbucks Corporation (NASDAQ:SBUX), Monster Beverage Corporation (NASDAQ:MNST), McDonald’s Corporation (NYSE:MCD), The Kraft Heinz Company (NASDAQ:KHC) and The J.M. Smucker Company (NYSE:SJM) are set to profit from this segment of the industry.9. Federal Democratic Republic of Ethiopia Coffee Exports in 2021: $1.19 billionThe Federal Democratic Republic of Ethiopia is a landlocked Eastern European country that is often called the 'motherland' of coffee. This is due to the fact that the popular Arabica coffee bean is thought to have originated in the country. Coffee is grown in Ethiopia in primarily four regions. These are the Harrar, Sidama, Yirgacheffe, and Southwest regions. Out of these, Sidama is often called the birthplace of coffee. Ethiopian coffee beans include Longberry, Shortberry, and Mocha - with Longberry being the highest quality bean. Like other African coffee producers, Ethiopia is known for its private distributors instead of brands that sell the drink to consumers. Coffee from these companies is used by Starbucks, Forest Coffee, and others. Some top Ethiopian coffee distributors are Ambassa Enterprises, Shecha Coffee, and Garden of Coffee.8. Republic of Honduras Coffee Exports in 2021: $1.29 billionThe Republic of Honduras is a Central American country with a $49 billion economy and one that is rich in mineral resources. Agriculture is the backbone of the Honduran economy, with coffee exports often accounting for a large chunk of its foreign currency earnings. The country has six coffee growing regions, which are Opalaca, Comayagua, Montecillos, Agalta, El Paraiso, and Copan. Honduran coffee packaging often features pictures of the region where it was grown, and some coffee companies are Beneficio De Cafe Montecristo S.A., Cafes Finos De Exportacion S. De R.L., Beneficio De Cafe Inloher S. De, and Lurvin Radames Ventura Sagastume.7. French Republic Coffee Exports in 2021: $1.4 billionThe French Republic is a European country that is one of the most prosperous nations in the world. The French coffee industry is worth $12 billion in 2022, and it is expected to grow at a 4.4% CAGR between 2022 to 2025. Since France was one of the old colonial powers,  it also played a central role in spreading coffee all over the world. Additionally, one of the first coffee makers was invented in France in the 1800s. Some well known French coffee roasters are Café Lomi, Hexagone Café, Partisan Café Artisanal, and The Beans on Fire.6. Italian Republic Coffee Exports in 2021: $2 billionThe Italian Republic is another European country with a large economy and one that is known for a strong food industry. Like Italian wine and cheese, Italian coffee has also made its mark on the world. The country's coffee industry was worth $3.7 billion in 2020, and it is expected to grow and sit at $4.4 billion in 2024. Italy is also home to one of the oldest and largest coffee companies in the world, Luigi Lavazza S.p.A. Like other Italian businesses, Lavazza is also a family run enterprise. Some famous Italian coffee roasters are His Majesty the Coffee and Picapau Coffee Roastery. Due to a rise in coffee consumption, coffee sellers like Starbucks Corporation (NASDAQ:SBUX), Monster Beverage Corporation (NASDAQ:MNST), McDonald’s Corporation (NYSE:MCD), The Kraft Heinz Company (NASDAQ:KHC) and The J.M. Smucker Company (NYSE:SJM) are seeing high coffee sales all over the world. Click to continue reading and see 5 Countries That Produce the Best Coffee in the World.  Suggested Articles:12 Countries That Produce the Best Cheese in the World12 Dividend stocks That Outperform S&amp;P 50013 Biggest Meat Processing Companies in the USDisclosure: None. 12 Countries That Produce the Best Coffee in the World is originally published on Insider Monkey.]"

Investors can't control the latter, but they can focus on a company's earnings results every quarter.Life and the stock market are both about expectations, and rising above what is expected is often rewarded, while falling short can come with negative consequences. Investors might want to try to capture stronger returns by finding positive earnings surprises.2 Stocks to Add to Your WatchlistThe Zacks Earnings ESP is more formally known as the Expected Surprise Prediction, and it aims to grab the inside track on the latest analyst estimate revisions ahead of a company's report. The idea is relatively intuitive as a newer projection might be based on more complete information.

314,783113c9-647d-30eb-ba83-f2d23ed96fad,NWL,2022-12-20,3 Consumer Discretionary Stocks to Sell on Failing Fundamentals,InvestorPlace,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/3-consumer-discretionary-stocks-sell-135508201.html,1671198908,STORY,"['SWK', 'LYV', 'NWL', 'VFC']","[If you’re looking for consumer discretionary stocks to sell, VF Corp. (NYSE:VFC) shareholders might want to reconsider their positions.  CEO Steve Rendle stepped down as CEO of the apparel conglomerate on Dec. 5. The move, which came as a surprise to many industry experts, suggests that the board increasingly was growing disenchanted with the company’s fundamentals, especially in North America. Rendle had been CEO for nearly six years and spent almost 25 years with the company. To step aside without a succession plan in place sounds like a leader who was pushed out rather than a traditional retirement.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsWith economic uncertainty factoring into corporate decisions, VF can’t be the only consumer discretionary name struggling. According to Yardeni Research, the S&amp;P 500 consumer discretionary sector was down 32.7% year-to-date through Dec. 12. A quick screen of consumer discretionary stocks gives me 132 names to choose from. Of those, I’ll only consider stocks down at least 20% YTD. That brings the total down to 42 names.Here are my three consumer discretionary stocks to sell heading into 2023.LYVLive Nation Entertainment$70.23SWKStanley Black &amp; Decker78.07NWLNewell Brands$13.20Live Nation Entertainment (LYV)Live Nation website displayed on smartphone hidden in jeans pocket.Source: Piotr Swat / ShutterstockLive Nation Entertainment (NYSE:LYV) is down over 40% YTD. When you combine terrible public relations from the Taylor Swift ticket-buying fiasco at its Ticketmaster subsidiary with a Department of Justice (DOJ) antitrust investigation that reportedly opened before November’s brouhaha, Live Nation shareholders might be wise to head for the exits before the Feds decide to crack down on Ticketmaster’s monopoly. It’s not a good look.Ticketmaster and Taylor Swift did say that the pre-sale for her Eras tour sold 2.4 million tickets, the most ever sold for an artist in a single day. Further, the company said that there were 90% fewer tickets sold on secondary resale websites. Story continuesAnalysts believe that a DOJ investigation won’t solve the problem of secondary markets.“From a big picture perspective, the fact that people are wanting to go see live music with this much enthusiasm should be really good for Live Nation in the long term,” stated William Blair analyst Ryan Sundby.The biggest problem is if the DOJ forces Live Nation to break apart from Ticketmaster because they’ve become completely intertwined.In Q3 2022, the company’s concert segment generated $5.29 billion in revenue, up from $2.15 billion a year earlier. While concerts accounted for 86% of its overall revenue, it relies on Ticketmaster to handle ticketing for many of its concerts. Ticketing accounted for 8.6% of its overall revenue in the third quarter. The company’s third segment is sponsorship &amp; advertising. It accounted for 5.6% of Live Nation’s overall revenue. It works with the other two segments to generate revenue. A breakup would hurt all three of the company’s operating segments. Until this issue is sorted, LYV stock will face downward pressure. I would sell before then.Stanley Black &amp; Decker (SWK)Stanley Black and Decker (SWK) is a manufacturer of industrial tools and household hardware and provider of security productsSource: ricochet64 / Shutterstock.comMy wife’s business partner’s favorite power tool brand is DeWalt, which has been owned by Black &amp; Decker since 1960 when it acquired the company from AMF, a conglomerate of the times.In November 2009, Black &amp; Decker was acquired by Stanley Works for $4.5 billion, and the global tool company following the merger was called Stanley Black &amp; Decker (NYSE:SWK). The all-stock deal saw Stanley shareholders owning 50.5% of the combined company, with Black &amp; Decker’s shareholders owning 49.5%.In the 12 years since, SWK stock has gained just 36%. Over the same period, the index is up 233%, a more than four-fold gain. Value investors will point to the fact that SWK has fallen 63% from its May 2021 all-time high of $225, suggesting the company’s stock is severely oversold. Dividend investors will argue that this dividend king — any stock that has increased its dividend for 50 consecutive years or more — has an exceptional 3.9% yield, higher than it’s been since the financial crisis.   The problem with yield chasing is that it doesn’t fix the main issue with Stanley Black &amp; Decker, which is that its margins are terrible. In the trailing 12 months ended Oct. 1, its gross and operating margins were 27.55% and 5.12%, considerably lower than their five-year averages of 33.90% and 10.43%, respectively.SWK stock is cheap because its business is a mess. Of 19 analysts covering the company, 15 rate it as hold or worse, a sign that Wall Street isn’t convinced the company can fix what ails it. The median target price of $81 is above where it’s currently trading. This is not a stock I’d want to own heading into a possible recession. Newell Brands (NWL)A photo of a sign showing the Newell Brands (NWL) logo outside a building.Source: JHVEPhoto/Shutterstock.comOn two occasions in Newell Brands’ (NASDAQ:NWL) long and sometimes illustrious history, NWL stock has traded higher than $50. The first time was in 1998-1999. The second was in 2016-2017, not too long after announcing their purchase of Jarden in late 2015.It’s been a miserable time for long-term, buy-and-hold shareholders. It did make a brief recovery midway through 2021, but it’s down 51% since. In early December, I suggested that the company still had too many brands on its roster, and that a new CEO is a must if it is to recover from the depths it currently finds itself. In 2022, through the first nine months of the fiscal year, Newell’s sales are down 7.8%, while its operating income is off nearly 27%. The situation in the third quarter has accelerated its woes, with revenue and operating income falling 19.2% and 87.5%, respectively.Worse still, it’s burning through cash. Through the first nine months of 2021, Newell had positive cash flow of $490 million. In 2022, its cash flow is -$567 million through the end of the third quarter. This is nearly $1.1 billion worse than a year ago. So, to solve some of its operational deficiencies, it hired a new CFO. His name is Mark Erceg, and he served as CFO for at least four public companies in his 30-year business career. The man relishes a challenge. The argument for a conglomerate-style business such as Newell has always been that its heft of brands gives it more sway with the Walmarts (NYSE:WMT) and Targets (NYSE:TGT) of the world. However, the truth is that these discount retailers would gladly deal with a standalone Rubbermaid business if that’s what the customers wanted. A quick look at Newell’s 10-Q suggests that one or both of its commercial solutions (Rubbermaid) and learning and development (Sharpie, Papermate, EXPO) segments ought to be spun out into their own independent public companies. You can own Conglomerate A (Berkshire Hathaway) (NYSE:BRK-A, NYSE:BRK-B) or Conglomerate B (Newell Brands).I know which one I’d own.On the date of publication, Will Ashworth did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

View our latest analysis for United Parcel Service United Parcel Service Insider Transactions Over The Last YearOver the last year, we can see that the biggest insider sale was by the Executive VP &amp; Chief Marketing Officer, Kevin Warren, for US$2.5m worth of shares, at about US$192 per share. That means that an insider was selling shares at around the current price of US$178. While we don't usually like to see insider selling, it's more concerning if the sales take place at a lower price. We note that this sale took place at around the current price, so it isn't a major concern, though it's hardly a good sign. Kevin Warren was the only individual insider to sell over the last year.You can see a visual depiction of insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last 12 months, below.

View current credit card offerings from our partners at CardCritics Here or on the issuer’s website.According to a Federal Trade Commission report, annual fees on credit cards have been increasing steadily over the years. The average annual fee in 2020 was $94 per card, according to the FTC report.Higher fees might be more and more difficult for some cardholders to justify. But despite the upward trend in annual fees, many credit cards come with some excellent perks. In fact, credit cards can have such lucrative benefits that an annual fee might be worth it.Explore: GOBankingRates’ Best Credit Cards for 2023More: 3 Easy Tips To Turn Your Credit Woes Into WowsYou might wonder how credit cards can possibly offer benefits that are potentially more valuable than the annual fee. It’s a fair question, but the answer is straightforward.Credit cards primarily make their money from interest charges to cardholders. By offering attractive sign-up bonuses and other benefits, credit card issuers can attract new customers who might end up paying more interest charges than the value of any benefits the card offers.Thus, in order to “erase” your credit card’s annual fees, it’s important to completely repay your balances every month and not carry them over. In that context, we’ll take a look at how you can use credit card benefits to offset annual partly or even entirely.Lucrative Sign-Up BonusesOne of the best ways to erase your credit card’s annual fee is with sign-up bonuses. Typically, more valuable signup bonuses are paired with high annual fee credit cards. “Credit cards with the best features and rewards typically impose annual fees on cardholders. In many cases, these benefits can offset the cost of the fees,” says Nirit Rubenstein, co-founder &amp; CEO at Dovly.Rubenstein continued, adding that you should work the numbers to see if the fee is worth it. “Before jumping on an offer, make sure to do the math, considering how much you’ll spend and how many rewards you’ll capture over the course of the year, and then weigh those benefits against the annual cost.”Story continuesSign-up bonuses also require cardholders to spend a certain amount within a given timeframe, such as $500 in the first three months. The amount of time varies, as does the spending requirement; some cards require you to spend several thousand dollars. Thus, you will have to ensure you can meet the spending requirement to take advantage of the bonus.Ongoing PerksIn addition to sign-up bonuses, credit cards offer perks that continue as long as you keep using them. If sign-up bonuses are what tempt people to sign up for credit cards, ongoing perks are what keep them onboard.Different credit cards have different kinds of perks, so you should look for ones that best fit your preferences and spending habits. For example, some credit cards are ideal for travelers, says Lyle Solomon, bankruptcy attorney at Oak View Law Group. “For example, if you travel often, many cards include travel protection and offer supplemental insurance for rental cars. As anyone who travels knows, the insurance costs can add up. Even less than a week per year with a rental car can more than pay for many annual fees.”Pre-Pay Purchases and BillsIs there a credit card that has all of the benefits you want, but the sign-up bonus spend is high for your spending habits? If so, one option is to pre-pay purchases. For instance, some rewards hackers use their new credit cards to pay for things like utilities, cable, and internet bills for the next six months.Of course, this only works if you pay a flat rate, which isn’t always the case for utilities. Nevertheless, you can ask your various service providers if pre-paying is an option for those flat-rate charges.If that won’t quite allow you to reach your minimum spend amount, you might also be able to pay your bills with your credit card. That includes car insurance, car payments, and even rent. In some cases, paying with a credit card isn’t permitted, but there are third-party services that allow you to pay for a fee. The fee can be significant but might still be worth it if the sign-up bonus is lucrative enough and you are having trouble meeting your minimum spend.Benefits for TravelersThe COVID-19 pandemic brought travel to a screeching halt in many cases. But people are starting to travel again at nearly the levels they did before the pandemic. If you are in that category, a travel credit card can quickly become more valuable than its fee.“The American Express Platinum card is usually considered quite expensive at $695 [a] year. While the benefits of the card are slanted toward people that travel, you can quickly cover the cost of this card with the credits offered,” says Faron Daugs, founder and CEO at Harrison Wallace Financial Group.Daugs noted several perks of the Platinum card that on their own can pay for the annual fee. These include a $200 per year airline bag credit, $200 per year in hotel credits, $240 per year Sirius XM credit, and $180 per year Uber credit.More From GOBankingRates25 Sneaky Car Dealership Tricks To Avoid at All CostsSocial Security Payment Schedule 2023: What Dates To Watch Out ForThe 10 Best Balance Transfer Credit Cards for 20237 Ways To Know You're Ready To Start InvestingAll information about American Express Platinum Card has been collected independently by GOBankingRates.

Estimates for utilities stocks also rose 0.9% over that period.Two sectors witnessed an increase in their bottom-up EPS estimate for CY 2023 between Sept. 30 and Nov. 30, led by the Energy (+4.4%) sector. (Source: FactSet)The upward changes to estimates for energy come even as the sector is poised to face difficult year-over-year comparisons in 2023, with an expected revenue decline of -7.3% next year after a blowout 2022, per FactSet data.Energy has also been the largest contributor to earnings growth for the S&amp;P 500 this year. Excluding energy's 5.1% earnings growth, the index would be set to report an earnings decline of -1.8%.Strategists also point out that oil companies have been prudent despite this year's surge in oil prices and optimism about persistently higher prices.Story continuesCIBC Private Wealth U.S. Sr. Energy Trader Rebecca Babin told Yahoo Finance Live that companies “are not making rash decisions about increasing production” based on swings in oil prices.“They are less levered,” Babin said. “They are more disciplined, and they are super focused on returning to cash.”This content is not available due to your privacy preferences.Update your settings here to see it.Not only has energy surged nearly 55% year-to-date in 2022, but it has no competition — the other 10 sectors in the S&amp;P 500 are negative this year, while the broader benchmark index is down roughly 19% this year.Shares of Exxon Mobil (XOM), the largest oil and gas company in the U.S., are up about 65% this year. Chevron (CVX), the second-largest, is up more than 40% in 2022.Meanwhile, Occidental Petroleum (OXY), a star performer this year, with shares more than doubling as Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway increased its stake in the company throughout the year, now holding a 20.9% position in the company.Oil prices, meanwhile, have reversed all of their gains this year after touching a high north of $120 per barrel in June. Supply-and-demand concerns related to rising interest rates, inflation, COVID lockdowns in China, and Russia's war in Ukraine have all contributed to extreme volatility in energy this year.While Wall Street has lowered its expectations for a spike in prices next year, strategists still largely expect oil to move higher in 2023, particularly due to predictions of higher demand as China reopens its economy after three years of COVID closures.Economists at Goldman Sachs last week said the bank sees Brent crude oil — the international benchmark price — averaging $98 per barrel and WTI, the U.S. benchmark price, at $92 a barrel. Previous forecasts saw targets of $110 for Brent and $105 a barrel for WTI.Emanuel, however, argued the comparison of energy stocks to oil prices is ""misplaced.”“If it weren't misplaced, we would have never bought an oil stock again in 2020 when the price of WTI turned negative,"" Emanuel said.—Alexandra Semenova is a reporter for Yahoo Finance.

332,bde72788-3874-3e1d-8434-a56b79ee3e98,OXY,2022-12-20,Occidental Petroleum Corporation (OXY) Is a Trending Stock: Facts to Know Before Betting on It,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/occidental-petroleum-corporation-oxy-trending-140002527.html,1671458402,STORY,['OXY'],"[Occidental Petroleum (OXY) has been one of the most searched-for stocks on Zacks.com lately. So, you might want to look at some of the facts that could shape the stock's performance in the near term.Shares of this oil and gas exploration and production company have returned -12.2% over the past month versus the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's -2.7% change. The Zacks Oil and Gas - Integrated - United States industry, to which Occidental belongs, has lost 12.9% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?Although media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.Revisions to Earnings EstimatesRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.Our analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.Occidental is expected to post earnings of $1.93 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +30.4%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -9.2%.The consensus earnings estimate of $9.68 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of +279.6%. This estimate has changed -2.5% over the last 30 days.Story continuesFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $7.26 indicates a change of -25% from what Occidental is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -7.9%.Having a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, Occidental is rated Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPS12-month consensus EPS estimate for OXY _12MonthEPSChartUrlProjected Revenue GrowthWhile earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.In the case of Occidental, the consensus sales estimate of $8.94 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of +11.6%. The $37.53 billion and $33.77 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of +42.6% and -10%, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryOccidental reported revenues of $9.5 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +39.4%. EPS of $2.44 for the same period compares with $0.87 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $9.35 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +1.58%. The EPS surprise was -1.61%.Over the last four quarters, Occidental surpassed consensus EPS estimates three times. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.ValuationWithout considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.Comparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.As part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.Occidental is graded A on this front, indicating that it is trading at a discount to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.ConclusionThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Occidental. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

But which of these two stocks is more attractive to value investors? We'll need to take a closer look to find out.There are plenty of strategies for discovering value stocks, but we have found that pairing a strong Zacks Rank with an impressive grade in the Value category of our Style Scores system produces the best returns.

For more companies, head on over to 5 Countries That Produce the Best Coffee in the World. Coffee is one of the most popular beverages in the world, and one with a long history, with the first mention of the drink tracing its way back to the tenth century CE. Since then, it has been used for its medicinal properties that helped with concentration and as a social activity to allow people to congregate at coffee shops. Global coffee consumption is booming, and according to estimates by the International Coffee Organization (ICO) consumption in the twelve months that ended in September 2022 is slated to sit at a whopping 170.3 million bags. However, despite this, a global coffee shortfall will continue, with a production of 167.2 million bags expected to stay behind the consumption.Automation and industrial engineering are changing the way farmers plant, monitor, and harvest their products, and the coffee industry is no exception. For instance, coffee farmers in Brazil are employing automation throughout the planting and harvesting processes. The machines that harvest coffee use the global positioning system (GPS) to allow farmers to keep track of the equipment and cameras to analyze the plant. Of course, this is just rudimentary technology compared to today's standards, and leading edge research into coffee production is now studying hyperspectral imaging for a variety of purposes. For instance, researchers have shown that a visible near (VIS-NIR) infrared sensor can be used to map out coffee plants to inspect them for insect damage.What's more is that this research also uses algorithms to let computers pick out the relevant damage patterns through just three image bands, with the initial subset of bands being selected through principle component analysis (PCA) - a basic type of machine learning. The same imaging processes can also be used to map out different coffee bean varieties, removing a large burden from farmers who previously had to crush the bean to find out its type and kind. In fact, coffee bean spectral imaging has been shown to achieve an 80% accuracy in identifying the right kind of bean. The use of technology to aid farmers with their quality gauging needs has also been commercialized, with Colombian firm Demetria providing farmers the tools to map out their bean profile with infrared light and then determine which bean they have come across through using an artificial intelligence platform. The company also provides technology that allows farmers to sift out high quality coffee bean stems by using handheld gadgets. The firm raised $3 million in 2021 to allow it to develop an automated platform for mapping out coffee beans based on acidity, flavor, and aroma by creating digital footprints.Story continuesAs far as the overall market goes, ICO estimates that global coffee exports stood at 9.7 million bags in October this year, marking a drop from the 9.87 bags exported in October 2021. According to Expert Market Research, the global coffee market was worth $114 billion in 2020 and it will grow at a compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) of 4.8% between 2018 to 2022. Out of the different product categories, the research firm estimates that instant coffee will hold the greatest market share, not only because it is easy and less time consuming to prepare, but also because it is good for metabolism and contains relatively lower amounts of caffeine. The research firm further outlines that increasing awareness of coffee's health benefits and a shift toward sustainable innovations for delivery will stimulate growth. Leading coffee producers and sellers are Starbucks Corporation (NASDAQ:SBUX), Monster Beverage Corporation (NASDAQ:MNST), McDonald’s Corporation (NYSE:MCD), The Kraft Heinz Company (NASDAQ:KHC), The J.M. Smucker Company (NYSE:SJM), and Nestlé S.A. (SWX:NESN.SW).Our Methodology We used global trade data segregated on the basis of the harmonized tariff schedule to see which countries export the best coffee. Overall, this data agrees with the ICO's assessment that coffee exports are declining, with the $36 billion of exports in 2021 falling by $144 million annually.Countries That Produce the Best Coffee in the World12. Netherlands Coffee Exports in 2021: $906 millionThe Netherlands is a European country with a $10.6 billion coffee market in 2020. The largest portion of the Dutch coffee market is the filtered coffee market with coffee capsules coming in second place. Additionally, the Dutch coffee market is expected to grow to $13 billion in 2027. The country is also known for its popular coffee shops, which are known globally for allowing visitors to legally consume cannabis in addition to coffee as well. Perhaps the most famous Dutch coffee brand is JDE Peet's N.V. (AMS:JDEP.AS)'s Douwe Egberts coffee. Douwe Egberts is one of the oldest coffee brands in the world, as it was initially set up in 1753 in the Netherlands. The Dutch have also played a vital role in the globalization of coffee, as they were one of the first to sell it out of the Middle East despite governments trying their best to prevent exports. The Netherlands exported $906 million of coffee in 2021, for 127,077 tons.11. Republic of Guatemala Coffee Exports in 2021: $928 millionThe Republic of Guatemala is a Central American country that is also the most populous in the region. Coffee plays a vital role in the country's economy, as it often ranks as its second largest export. The industry itself consists mostly of small farmers so much so that large growers often find themselves squeezed out due to poor profit margins. 96% of Guatemalan production in 2021 was of Arabica coffee beans. Some top coffee producing regions in the country are Nueva Oriente, San Marcos, and Huehuetenango - with the last being one of the highest coffee producing regions in the world at an altitude of 6,500 feet. Guatemalan coffee is used by big brands such as Starbucks Corporation (NASDAQ:SBUX) at its locations, particularly in the United States.10. Kingdom of Belgium Coffee Exports in 2021: $1 billionThe Kingdom of Belgium, or simply Belgium, is one of the most prosperous nations in the world with high standards of living. According to research from the European Union, the country was Europe's third largest importer of green coffee as of 2021. This is coffee that is an extract from unroasted coffee beans. Belgium's Port of Antwerp is capable of storing a whopping 250,000 tons of coffee - unsurprising since Belgium alone exported 296,050 tons of coffee in 2021. The country's coffee industry was worth $3.5 billion in 2022, and it is expected to grow at a CAGR of 8.34% by 2025. One of Belgium's largest and oldest coffee companies is the Miko NV (EBR:MIKO.BR), which traces its roots back to the 1900s and is headquartered in Turnhout.As coffee consumption in Europe grows, companies like Starbucks Corporation (NASDAQ:SBUX), Monster Beverage Corporation (NASDAQ:MNST), McDonald’s Corporation (NYSE:MCD), The Kraft Heinz Company (NASDAQ:KHC) and The J.M. Smucker Company (NYSE:SJM) are set to profit from this segment of the industry.9. Federal Democratic Republic of Ethiopia Coffee Exports in 2021: $1.19 billionThe Federal Democratic Republic of Ethiopia is a landlocked Eastern European country that is often called the 'motherland' of coffee. This is due to the fact that the popular Arabica coffee bean is thought to have originated in the country. Coffee is grown in Ethiopia in primarily four regions. These are the Harrar, Sidama, Yirgacheffe, and Southwest regions. Out of these, Sidama is often called the birthplace of coffee. Ethiopian coffee beans include Longberry, Shortberry, and Mocha - with Longberry being the highest quality bean. Like other African coffee producers, Ethiopia is known for its private distributors instead of brands that sell the drink to consumers. Coffee from these companies is used by Starbucks, Forest Coffee, and others. Some top Ethiopian coffee distributors are Ambassa Enterprises, Shecha Coffee, and Garden of Coffee.8. Republic of Honduras Coffee Exports in 2021: $1.29 billionThe Republic of Honduras is a Central American country with a $49 billion economy and one that is rich in mineral resources. Agriculture is the backbone of the Honduran economy, with coffee exports often accounting for a large chunk of its foreign currency earnings. The country has six coffee growing regions, which are Opalaca, Comayagua, Montecillos, Agalta, El Paraiso, and Copan. Honduran coffee packaging often features pictures of the region where it was grown, and some coffee companies are Beneficio De Cafe Montecristo S.A., Cafes Finos De Exportacion S. De R.L., Beneficio De Cafe Inloher S. De, and Lurvin Radames Ventura Sagastume.7. French Republic Coffee Exports in 2021: $1.4 billionThe French Republic is a European country that is one of the most prosperous nations in the world. The French coffee industry is worth $12 billion in 2022, and it is expected to grow at a 4.4% CAGR between 2022 to 2025. Since France was one of the old colonial powers,  it also played a central role in spreading coffee all over the world. Additionally, one of the first coffee makers was invented in France in the 1800s. Some well known French coffee roasters are Café Lomi, Hexagone Café, Partisan Café Artisanal, and The Beans on Fire.6. Italian Republic Coffee Exports in 2021: $2 billionThe Italian Republic is another European country with a large economy and one that is known for a strong food industry. Like Italian wine and cheese, Italian coffee has also made its mark on the world. The country's coffee industry was worth $3.7 billion in 2020, and it is expected to grow and sit at $4.4 billion in 2024. Italy is also home to one of the oldest and largest coffee companies in the world, Luigi Lavazza S.p.A. Like other Italian businesses, Lavazza is also a family run enterprise. Some famous Italian coffee roasters are His Majesty the Coffee and Picapau Coffee Roastery. Due to a rise in coffee consumption, coffee sellers like Starbucks Corporation (NASDAQ:SBUX), Monster Beverage Corporation (NASDAQ:MNST), McDonald’s Corporation (NYSE:MCD), The Kraft Heinz Company (NASDAQ:KHC) and The J.M. Smucker Company (NYSE:SJM) are seeing high coffee sales all over the world. Click to continue reading and see 5 Countries That Produce the Best Coffee in the World.  Suggested Articles:12 Countries That Produce the Best Cheese in the World12 Dividend stocks That Outperform S&amp;P 50013 Biggest Meat Processing Companies in the USDisclosure: None. 12 Countries That Produce the Best Coffee in the World is originally published on Insider Monkey.]"

For more countries, head on over to 5 Countries That Produce the Best Cosmetics in the World. Cosmetics, commonly known as makeup, are among the oldest products in the world. The industry has evolved massively over the past few decades and now uses advanced research to produce products for skin care, hair care, makeup, and a laundry list of other uses.Naturally, these use cases also make the cosmetics industry one of the largest in the world. Overall, the sector is dominated by a couple of large multinational players who spend billions of dollars on product development and marketing. According to the research firm Allied Market Research, the global cosmetics industry was worth $380 billion in 2019 and it will grow at a compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) of 5.3% to be worth $463 billion by the end of 2027. The industry is undergoing important shifts these days, with the focus on health, sustainability, and environmental friendliness compelling firms to move to recyclable packaging and natural ingredients. The research firm estimates that the skin and sun care market was the largest segment in 2019 and it will retain this share over the course of the forecast period. However, in terms of growth, the fragrance market is thought to be the strongest segment. Additionally, changing views about gender will also impact the cosmetics industry, with Allied Market Research estimating that the unisex cosmetics segment will outpace the broader market and grow at a 6.6% CAGR.Another report, this time from Fortune Business Insights, has similar estimates for the industry. It values the market at $284 billion in 2021 and pegs it with a CAGR of 5% for the time period between 2021 and 2028 for a final worth of $415 billion. It segregates the market geographically to outline that Asia Pacific was the largest segment in 2020, as it was worth roughly half of the entire market or $105 billion. However, Fortune Business Insights adds that North America will grow strongly due to higher purchasing power and a growth of salons in the region.Story continuesThe cosmetics industry is also making use of advanced technologies such as artificial intelligence (AI). For instance, L'Occitane International (SEHK:973.HK) allows its customers to use an AI powered countertop device to figure out their skin type. Once the type has been determined, the machine then provides the customer with a suitable skin cream that is freshly blended. Additionally, L'Oréal S.A. (EPA:OR.PA)'s subsidiary Lancôme uses a foundation machine to create a skin tone profile with the help of a colorimeter. This profile is then run through an algorithm to sift the right foundation from 20,000 different types in Lancôme's database. A machine mixes the right foundation right at the shop, just like L'Occitane's skin cream machine.Taiwan's New Kinpo Group has a smart mirror that provides users with a 'skin age'. This metric includes details such as pore density and wrinkles and is used to recommend products to customers. These uses are only a handful that is used in the cosmetics industry since it is heavily focused on improving personal appearance and therefore have a strong potential for interactions between the customer and the company.In terms of research going on in the industry right now, these days it is all about using stem cells to either reverse hair loss or improve hair growth. Researchers have shown that there is hope for using stem cells to regrow hair, and several companies offer products along these lines. These include Stemson Therapeutics, LLC, which uses induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) to create cells that lie at the very start of hair growth. Another stem cell solution maker is Italian firm Framesi Milan whose stem cell hair serums use apple and other stem cells to increase the blood flow in the scalp.Some notable names in the cosmetics and beauty industry include The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG), Ulta Beauty, Inc. (NASDAQ:ULTA), and The Estée Lauder Companies Inc. (NYSE:EL).Sorbis/Shutterstock.comOur Methodology We consulted global trade data to sift out which countries export the most makeup products.

Although, it's not wise to just take the P/E at face value as there may be an explanation why it's so lofty.With earnings growth that's superior to most other companies of late, Vertex Pharmaceuticals has been doing relatively well. It seems that many are expecting the strong earnings performance to persist, which has raised the P/E. You'd really hope so, otherwise you're paying a pretty hefty price for no particular reason. Check out our latest analysis for Vertex Pharmaceuticals peKeen to find out how analysts think Vertex Pharmaceuticals' future stacks up against the industry? In that case, our free report is a great place to start.Is There Enough Growth For Vertex Pharmaceuticals?There's an inherent assumption that a company should far outperform the market for P/E ratios like Vertex Pharmaceuticals' to be considered reasonable.If we review the last year of earnings growth, the company posted a terrific increase of 52%. The latest three year period has also seen an excellent 52% overall rise in EPS, aided by its short-term performance. Therefore, it's fair to say the earnings growth recently has been superb for the company.Shifting to the future, estimates from the analysts covering the company suggest earnings should grow by 9.1% per year over the next three years. Meanwhile, the rest of the market is forecast to expand by 9.2% per annum, which is not materially different.In light of this, it's curious that Vertex Pharmaceuticals' P/E sits above the majority of other companies. It seems most investors are ignoring the fairly average growth expectations and are willing to pay up for exposure to the stock. Although, additional gains will be difficult to achieve as this level of earnings growth is likely to weigh down the share price eventually.Story continuesWhat We Can Learn From Vertex Pharmaceuticals' P/E?While the price-to-earnings ratio shouldn't be the defining factor in whether you buy a stock or not, it's quite a capable barometer of earnings expectations.Our examination of Vertex Pharmaceuticals' analyst forecasts revealed that its market-matching earnings outlook isn't impacting its high P/E as much as we would have predicted. When we see an average earnings outlook with market-like growth, we suspect the share price is at risk of declining, sending the high P/E lower. Unless these conditions improve, it's challenging to accept these prices as being reasonable.There are also other vital risk factors to consider before investing and we've discovered 1 warning sign for Vertex Pharmaceuticals that you should be aware of.If you're unsure about the strength of Vertex Pharmaceuticals' business, why not explore our interactive list of stocks with solid business fundamentals for some other companies you may have missed.Have feedback on this article?

An uptick in M&amp;A deals, strong earnings performance, new drug approvals, a favorable regulatory environment and pipeline successes helped the sector turn around.While the broader market is grappling with rising interest rates and inflation, innovation — the sector's driving force — continues to take place, with the trend expected to continue in 2023. M&amp;A in the drug and biotech sector is also expected to pick up noticeably.It is a defensive sector to invest in the present environment of rising interest rates and economic uncertainty.Several companies in the drug and biotech sector have returned 40% or more in 2022 so far and have room for more growth in 2023. Here we discuss four such companies, Merck, Vertex Pharmaceuticals, Immunocore Holdings and Immunovant.MerckBased in Kenilworth, NJ, Merck boasts more than six blockbuster drugs in its portfolio, with PD-L1 inhibitor, Keytruda, approved for several types of cancer and alone accounting for around 40% of the company's pharmaceutical sales. An ongoing recovery from the disruptions related to the pandemic and strong global underlying demand across its business, particularly for Keytruda and Gardasil vaccines to prevent HPV-related cancers, are boosting Merck's sales performance.Story continuesKeytruda is continuously growing and expanding into new indications and markets globally. With continued label expansion into new indications &amp; early-stage settings, Keytruda is expected to remain a key top-line driver. Merck's Animal Health business has been a key contributor to its top-line growth, with the company recording above-market growth. The trend is expected to continue in 2023. Merck boasts a strong cancer pipeline, including Keytruda, which should help drive long-term growth.Merck's stock has risen 43.0% this year so far. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2022 has risen from $7.31 per share to $7.38 per share while that for 2023 has gone up from $7.21 per share to $7.34 per share over the past 60 days. Merck has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Vertex PharmaceuticalsVertex's main area of focus is cystic fibrosis (CF). With its four CF medicines, Vertex treats the majority of the 83,000 patients living with CF in the United States, Europe, Canada and Australia. Vertex's CF sales continue to grow driven by its triple therapy, Trikafta/Kaftrio. New reimbursement agreements in ex-U.S. markets and label expansions to younger age groups in the United States are driving Trikafta/Kaftrio sales higher. Vertex faces only minimal competition in its core CF franchise.While Vertex's main focus is the development and strengthening of its CF franchise, the company also has a rapidly advancing mid- to late-stage pipeline in seven additional diseases like acute pain, sickle cell disease, beta-thalassemia, APOL1-mediated kidney diseases, alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency and cell therapy for type I diabetes.Many of these candidates represent multibillion-dollar opportunities. Programs in five disease areas are now entering or progressing through late-stage clinical development. Multiple late-stage projects have established proof of concept. Several data readouts are scheduled for 2023 that can be important catalysts for the stock.Vertex Pharmaceuticals' stock has risen 40.4% this year so far. Estimates for Vertex's 2022 earnings have gone up from $14.21 to $14.65 per share, while that for 2023 have increased from $15.10 to $15.62 per share over the past 60 days. Vertex has a Zacks Rank of 3.Immunocore HoldingsImmunocore has made the world's first soluble TCR therapy, KIMMTRAK, which has been approved for the treatment of unresectable or metastatic uveal melanoma, a rare and aggressive form of melanoma, which affects the eye, in several countries, including the United States. KIMMTRAK has witnessed strong uptake in academic and community treatment centers. Immunocore, also at a recent medical meeting, announced promising clinical data on its first molecule to target the PRAME antigen, IMC-F106C-101.In July, Immunicore announced a private investment in public equity (""PIPE"") financing with four existing investors for net proceeds of $139.6 million. This PIPE financing, along with the strong commercial performance of KIMMTRAK, boosts the company's growth prospects.Immunocore's stock has risen 73.5% this year so far. Loss estimates for 2022 have narrowed from $1.25 to 54 cents per share, while that for 2023 have improved from $1.69 to 70 cents per share over the past 60 days. Immunocare has a Zacks Rank of 2.ImmunovantImmunovant is progressing well with the development of its lead pipeline candidate, batoclimab (formerly IMVT-1401), for the treatment of several types of autoimmune diseases. Immunovant is developing batoclimab, with an initial focus on the treatment of myasthenia gravis, thyroid eye disease and warm autoimmune hemolytic anemia.The company believes that, if approved, the candidate will become a cornerstone therapy for treating many auto-antibody-driven diseases and would be a unique treatment, different from the currently available ones that are more invasive for advanced immunoglobulin G-mediated autoimmune diseases.Immunovant's stock has risen 78.5% this year so far. Loss estimates for 2022 have narrowed from $1.64 to $1.56 per share, while that for 2023 have improved from $1.83 to $1.60 per share over the past 60 days.

But don't panic — here are 3 stocks to help protect you from the pain,MoneyWise,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/bloomberg-now-expects-2023-one-200000187.html,1671480000,STORY,"['KR', 'KO']","[Bloomberg now expects 2023 to be one of the worst years for the world economy since 1993. But don't panic — here are 3 stocks to help protect you from the painThe world economy has largely bounced back from the COVID-19 pandemic, but dark times could lie ahead according to Bloomberg.Economist Scott Johnson at Bloomberg Economics forecasts that the world economy will grow 2.4% in 2023, marking a slowdown from the 3.2% growth expected for this year. 2.4% would be the slowest growth since 1993 — except for the crisis years of 2009 and 2020.His analysis also shows the U.S. economy entering a recession at the end of 2023. For the euro area, a recession is expected at the start of the year.“In the US, with wage gains set to keep inflation above target, we think the Fed is headed toward a terminal rate of 5%, and will stay there till 1Q24,” Johnson writes. “In the euro area, meanwhile, a more rapid decline in inflation will mean a lower terminal rate and the possibility of cuts at the end of 2023.”The prospect of a recession does not bode well for stocks. U.S. GDP demonstrated growth in Q3 and the S&amp;P 500 is still down 19% year-to-date.Of course, some businesses are more resilient than others. Here’s a look at three companies capable of making money through thick and thin. Wall Street also sees significant upside in this trio.Don't missUBS says 61% of millionaire collectors allocate up to 30% of their overall portfolio to this exclusive asset classYou could be the landlord of Walmart, Whole Foods and Kroger (and collect fat grocery store-anchored income on a quarterly basis)The average home insurance policy is nearly 40% higher than it was 12 years ago — here's how to spend less on peace of mindSouthern CoSouthern (NYSE:SO) is a gas and electric utility holding company headquartered in Atlanta. It serves about nine million customers.The utility sector is known for being a defensive play. No matter how many times the Fed raises interest rates — and how bad next year turns out to be — people still need to heat their homes in the winter and turn the lights on at night.The recession-proof nature of the business also means Southern can pay reliable dividends.Story continuesIn April, the company boosted its quarterly payout by 2 cents per share to 68 cents per share, marking the 21st consecutive year that Southern has increased its dividend.Look further back, and you’ll see that the company has paid steady or increasing dividends since 1948.In the first nine months of 2022, Southern earned an adjusted profit of $3.35 per share, up 9.8% from the same period last year.Last Wednesday, Wells Fargo analyst Neil Kalton raised his price target on Southern from $70 to $77. While he kept an Equal Weight rating on the shares, the new price target implies a potential upside of 11%.KrogerThe economy moves in cycles, but people always need to shop for food. As a result, Kroger (NYSE:KR) can make money through our economy’s ups and downs.That’s one of the reasons why in an era where physical stores are under serious threat from online merchants, Kroger remains a brick-and-mortar beast.Read more: The 10 best investing apps for 'once-in-a-generation' opportunities (even if you're a beginner)The company has expanded its online presence, too. Kroger’s digital sales in 2021 clocked in 113% higher compared to two years ago.You can see Kroger’s resilience in its dividend history: the company has increased its payout to shareholders for 16 consecutive years.Evercore ISI analyst Michael Montani recently upgraded Kroger from ‘in line’ to ‘outperform’ with a price target of $56 — implying a potential upside of 26% from where the stock sits today.Coca-ColaLet’s round out the list with Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO) — a classic example of a recession-resistant business. Whether the economy is booming or struggling, a can of Coke is affordable for most people.The company’s entrenched market position, massive scale, and portfolio of iconic brands — including names like Sprite, Fresca, Dasani and Smartwater — give it plenty of pricing power.Add solid geographic diversification — its products are sold in more than 200 countries and territories around the globe — and it’s clear that Coca-Cola can thrive under all circumstances. After all, the company went public more than 100 years ago.More impressively, Coca-Cola has increased its dividend for 60 consecutive years. The stock currently yields 2.8%.UBS analyst Peter Grom has a ‘buy’ rating on Coca-Cola and a price target of $68 — roughly 9% above where the stock sits today.What to read next'Hold onto your money': Jeff Bezos says you might want to rethink buying a 'new automobile, refrigerator, or whatever' — here are 3 better recession-proof buysWant to invest your spare change but don't know where to start?

But as Peter Lynch said in One Up On Wall Street, 'Long shots almost never pay off.' While a well funded company may sustain losses for years, it will need to generate a profit eventually, or else investors will move on and the company will wither away.If this kind of company isn't your style, you like companies that generate revenue, and even earn profits, then you may well be interested in Waste Management (NYSE:WM). Now this is not to say that the company presents the best investment opportunity around, but profitability is a key component to success in business. View our latest analysis for Waste Management How Quickly Is Waste Management Increasing Earnings Per Share?Generally, companies experiencing growth in earnings per share (EPS) should see similar trends in share price. So it makes sense that experienced investors pay close attention to company EPS when undertaking investment research. We can see that in the last three years Waste Management grew its EPS by 9.8% per year. That's a pretty good rate, if the company can sustain it.Top-line growth is a great indicator that growth is sustainable, and combined with a high earnings before interest and taxation (EBIT) margin, it's a great way for a company to maintain a competitive advantage in the market. While we note Waste Management achieved similar EBIT margins to last year, revenue grew by a solid 12% to US$19b. That's a real positive.The chart below shows how the company's bottom and top lines have progressed over time.

While crystal balls don't exist, you can check our visualization of consensus analyst forecasts for Waste Management's future EPS 100% free.Story continuesAre Waste Management Insiders Aligned With All Shareholders?We would not expect to see insiders owning a large percentage of a US$65b company like Waste Management. But thanks to their investment in the company, it's pleasing to see that there are still incentives to align their actions with the shareholders. Notably, they have an enviable stake in the company, worth US$109m. This comes in at 0.2% of shares in the company, which is a fair amount of a business of this size. This still shows shareholders there is a degree of alignment between management and themselves.Does Waste Management Deserve A Spot On Your Watchlist?One positive for Waste Management is that it is growing EPS. That's nice to see. To add an extra spark to the fire, significant insider ownership in the company is another highlight. The combination definitely favoured by investors so consider keeping the company on a watchlist. We don't want to rain on the parade too much, but we did also find 1 warning sign for Waste Management that you need to be mindful of.There's always the possibility of doing well buying stocks that are not growing earnings and do not have insiders buying shares.

Let’s take a closer look at each one.Raytheon TechnologiesRaytheon Technologies provides advanced systems and services worldwide for commercial, military, and government customers. Just recently, the company authorized a $6 billion share buyback program.RTX sports a favorable growth profile; earnings are forecasted to climb more than 11% in its current fiscal year (FY22) and a further 9.3% in FY23.The projected earnings growth comes on top of forecasted Y/Y revenue upticks of 4.3% in FY22 and 8% in FY23.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchIn addition, for those with an appetite for income, RTX has that covered; the company’s annual dividend currently yields a solid 2.2%, well above its Zacks Aerospace sector average.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchWaste ManagementWaste Management is a leading provider of comprehensive waste management services in North America. Earlier in December, the company’s board approved a $1.5 billion share buyback program.Waste Management has consistently posted better-than-expected quarterly results as of late, exceeding earnings and revenue estimates in four consecutive quarters.Story continuesIn its latest release, WM exceeded the Zacks Consensus EPS Estimate by 4% and posted a marginal revenue surprise. Below is a chart illustrating the company’s revenue on a quarterly basis.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchFurther, WM rewards its shareholders via its annual dividend, currently yielding a respectable 1.6%. Impressively, the company has upped its payout five times over the last five years, translating to an 8.2% five-year annualized growth rate.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchKellogg’sKellogg’s manufactures and markets ready-to-eat convenience foods, carrying a balanced portfolio of cereal and snack products. In early December, the company unveiled that its board approved a new $1.5 billion share repurchase program.Like WM, Kellogg’s has been on an impressive earnings streak, exceeding earnings and revenue estimates in eight consecutive quarters.

The work they are doing with our students in the Charlotte community is paramount,"" said Ashleigh Anderson, Head of HR and Talent at Credit Karma. ""Credit Karma’s mission is to help consumers achieve financial progress, and financial progress often hinges on a person's access to resources and opportunities, like going to college. In fact, we did a study at Credit Karma that found nearly half of the Gen Z respondents felt uncomfortable with the idea of taking on student loan debt. By helping students who lack the necessary resources to excel in their education, we hope to put them on a clearer path to financial progress.""""Right now, there are 3,000 students who are eligible for our services in Charlotte Mecklenburg Schools and we only have the resources to support 200 of those students. This donation from Credit Karma will enable us to triple the number of students we are able to support over the next three years and will fund our College Persistence Program,"" said Ian Joyce, Executive Director of GenOne. ""Around 33% of low-income students that enroll in college or university don’t show up for their first day of classes, known as the ‘Summer Melt’.

If you want to see more stocks in this selection, check out 5 Best Medical Technology Stocks To Buy. The global medical devices market is expected to grow from $495.46 billion in 2022 to $718.92 billion by 2029 at a CAGR of 5.5% during the forecast period. Increasing investments in research and development by medical technology firms, combined with favorable policies and regulations, are anticipated to advance the medical device industry over the next few years. Following the pandemic years, digital healthcare has become indispensable, and the medical technology industry has seen meaningful demand for online medical and AI-powered technology services. Companies in the digital healthcare space have witnessed their stocks rally despite economic turbulence. During the pandemic, seeing the accelerating demand for medtech treatment options, many conventional healthcare companies transformed themselves and offered technology-led health solutions to survive and gain market share. Some of the most popular medtech solutions include telemedicine, robotic surgery, medical imaging technologies, wearable medical devices, and AI-led healthcare management options. Investors seeking exposure to the medical technology sector can pick up stocks like DexCom, Inc. (NASDAQ:DXCM), Intuitive Surgical, Inc. (NASDAQ:ISRG), and Danaher Corporation (NYSE:DHR). Our Methodology We selected the following medical technology stocks based on positive analyst coverage, strong business fundamentals, and market visibility. We have assessed the hedge fund sentiment from Insider Monkey’s database of 920 elite hedge funds tracked as of the end of the third quarter of 2022. The list is arranged according to the number of hedge fund holders in each firm. Best Medical Technology Stocks to Buy11. Stryker Corporation (NYSE:SYK)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 34Stryker Corporation (NYSE:SYK) is a Michigan-based medical technology company that operates through two segments – MedSurg and Neurotechnology, and Orthopaedics and Spine. The company offers implants for use in joint replacements and trauma surgeries. Stryker Corporation (NYSE:SYK) also provides surgical equipment and surgical navigation systems, endoscopic and communications systems, emergency medical equipment, intensive care disposable products, and reprocessed and remanufactured medical devices. Story continuesOn December 7, Stryker Corporation (NYSE:SYK) declared a $0.75 per share quarterly dividend, a 7.9% increase from its prior dividend of $0.695. The dividend is payable on January 31, 2023 to shareholders of record on December 30. The dividend yield on December 19 came in at 1.25%. Cowen analyst Joshua Jennings on December 14 raised the price target on Stryker Corporation (NYSE:SYK) to $283 from $233 and kept an Outperform rating on the shares. The analyst said the company looks positioned to provide positive 2023 revenue guidance on the back of a strong fourth quarter.According to Insider Monkey’s data, 34 hedge funds were bullish on Stryker Corporation (NYSE:SYK) at the end of September 2022, compared to 46 funds in the prior quarter. Terry Smith’s Fundsmith LLP is the largest stakeholder of the company, with 5.6 million shares worth $1.14 billion.Like DexCom, Inc. (NASDAQ:DXCM), Intuitive Surgical, Inc. (NASDAQ:ISRG), and Danaher Corporation (NYSE:DHR), Stryker Corporation (NYSE:SYK) is one of the premier medical technology stocks to consider. Diamond Hill Capital made the following comment about Stryker Corporation (NYSE:SYK) in its Q3 2022 investor letter:“Stryker Corporation (NYSE:SYK) was the only new addition to the portfolio in Q3. It is one of the largest medical device manufacturers with a track record of consistently outgrowing its end markets and competitors. Stryker has a highly performance driven culture with a decentralized operating model that results in strong incentive alignment within the company. We believe the management team has executed well, making small but meaningful decisions that have positioned the firm well among competitors. Management operates with a market share gain mentality and strives to be a category leader in the market they are in. Stryker also benefits from its broad portfolio of surgical tools, small and large cap hospital equipment, waste management products, etc., which enables it to address all the needs of a hospital operating room and be a one-stop shop for health care facilities. This is particularly appealing to hospitals, and it positions Stryker to be the supplier of all operating room equipment versus a single product, thus enabling the company to gain market share.”10. Inspire Medical Systems, Inc. (NYSE:INSP)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 37Inspire Medical Systems, Inc. (NYSE:INSP) is a Minnesota-based medical technology company focused on the development and commercialization of minimally invasive solutions for patients with obstructive sleep apnea in the United States and internationally. It is one of the best medical technology stocks to invest in. On November 1, Inspire Medical Systems, Inc. (NYSE:INSP) reported a revenue of $109.2 million, up 77.0% year-over-year, beating Wall Street estimates by $14.59 million. Inspire Medical Systems, Inc. (NYSE:INSP) raised its full-year 2022 revenue guidance to between $384 million to $388 million, which would represent growth of 65% to 66% over the 2021 revenue of $233.4 million. This compares to the prior revenue guidance of $354 million to $362 million and a Wall Street estimate of $361.29 million.Goldman Sachs analyst Amit Hazan upgraded Inspire Medical Systems, Inc. (NYSE:INSP) on December 13 to Buy from Neutral with a price target of $308, up from $245. Given ""strong visibility"" and the company's ""track record of execution,"" the analyst sees upside to present consensus and expects ""strong"" upcoming 2023 guidance. Given multiple compression over the last six months relative to the group, the shares now offer improved better risk/reward, added the analyst, who categorized Inspire Medical Systems, Inc. (NYSE:INSP) as his top Medtech midcap for 2023.According to Insider Monkey’s data, Inspire Medical Systems, Inc. (NYSE:INSP) was part of 37 hedge fund portfolios at the end of Q3 2022, compared to 31 in the prior quarter. Andreas Halvorsen’s Viking Global held the largest stake in the company, comprising 633,572 shares worth $112.3 million. Here is what Alger Capital specifically said about Inspire Medical Systems, Inc. (NYSE:INSP) in its Q2 2022 investor letter:“Inspire Medical Systems, Inc. (NYSE:INSP) markets the only FDA-approved implantable neuromodulation device used to treat obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). Inspire’s device monitors a patient’s breathing and delivers electrical stimulation to the hypoglossal nerve in order to maintain an open airway.We believe the second quarter underperformance of Inspire shares is primarily attributable to the rotation away from high-growth, high-valuation health care names that are currently unprofitable. Additionally, we think the underperformance was compounded by Inspire being one of the best-performing medical device stocks in the first quarter. We believe many investors have been “selling the winners” in a risk-off environment. Looking ahead, we continue to believe that Inspire is one of the best growth opportunities in medical devices with no anticipated immediate competition. We also believe its market is highly underpenetrated.”9. Align Technology, Inc. (NASDAQ:ALGN)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 38Align Technology, Inc. (NASDAQ:ALGN) is an Arizona-based medical device company that designs, manufactures, and markets Invisalign clear aligners and iTero intraoral scanners and services for restorative and aesthetic dentistry. On October 31, Align Technology, Inc. (NASDAQ:ALGN) announced an accelerated stock repurchase agreement with Goldman Sachs to repurchase $200 million of its common stock as part of the $1 billion share repurchase program disclosed in May. The transaction will be funded with cash on hand and is expected to conclude by February 1, 2023. Align Technology, Inc. (NASDAQ:ALGN) is one of the premier medical technology stocks to monitor. On October 27, Stifel analyst Jonathan Block maintained a Buy recommendation on Align Technology, Inc. (NASDAQ:ALGN) but lowered the price target on the shares to $265 from $325. Following the company's Q3 results and guidance, 2022 and 2023 EBITDA and EPS estimates are likely to ""come toppling down,"" said the analyst. Now, investors ""will have to decide if the tables could turn in coming quarters,"" noted Block, who added that comps will ease, innovation should improve, and that Align Technology, Inc. (NASDAQ:ALGN)’s market share ""seems to be relatively resilient.""According to Insider Monkey’s data, 38 hedge funds were bullish on Align Technology, Inc. (NASDAQ:ALGN) at the end of September 2022, compared to 33 funds in the last quarter. Brian Bares’ Bares Capital Management is the largest position holder in the company, with 913,324 shares worth over $189 million. Here is what Polen Global Growth has to say about Align Technology, Inc. (NASDAQ:ALGN) in its Q2 2022 investor letter:“Align Technology shares declined significantly during the second quarter when management reported a meaningful deceleration in growth. Management cited a host of challenges, including COVID19 impacts, especially in China with restrictions and lockdowns under their zero-COVID policy, a weaker economic environment, inflationary pressures, supply chain disruptions, and the war in Ukraine, to name a few. Tough comparisons were also a reality — Invisalign case starts in 1Q22 were roughly flat, having lapped the 66% growth from the prior year. It’s not completely surprising that growth is slowing on such tough comparisons, but the company’s shares declined on the news.By looking at Align’s three-year compound average growth rate (CAGR) to smooth out the ups and downs through COVID, key metrics like Invisalign case shipment, clear aligner revenue, and earnings per share have all grown ~20% during the trailing three years. We think this is quite respectable given the challenges during this period, but the lack of near-term momentum or visibility has not been well received in the current environment. According to our research, Align is the clear market leader, has global scale, a superior product, and still very modest market penetration. While growth may be challenged near term, we remain confident in the long-term growth opportunity.”8. Veeva Systems Inc. (NYSE:VEEV)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 42Veeva Systems Inc. (NYSE:VEEV) is a California-based company that provides cloud-based software for the life sciences industry in North America, Europe, the Asia Pacific, the Middle East, Africa, and Latin America. The company offers customer relationship management and data management applications for the medical industry. It is one of the premier medical technology stocks to monitor. On December 1, Veeva Systems Inc. (NYSE:VEEV) reported a Q3 non-GAAP EPS of $1.13 and a revenue of $552.35 million, outperforming Wall Street estimates by $0.06 and $6.29 million, respectively. Non-GAAP operating income for the third quarter was $219.5 million, compared to $199.4 million a year ago, representing an increase of 10% year-over-year.KeyBanc analyst Scott Schoenhaus on December 5 maintained an Overweight rating on Veeva Systems Inc. (NYSE:VEEV) but lowered the price target on the shares to $210 from $220 to reflect some multiple impairment as the company works toward moving its CRM business from Salesforce to its Vault Platform when the contract expires in September 2025. The analyst noted the company posted a strong quarter with top and bottom-line beats, but guided slightly below expectations on Q4 billings, revenue, and operating profits.According to Insider Monkey’s third quarter database, 42 hedge funds were long Veeva Systems Inc. (NYSE:VEEV), compared to 45 funds in the prior quarter. Greg Poole’s Echo Street Capital Management is the largest position holder in the company, with 899,876 shares worth $148.3 million. Here is what Artisan Partners specifically said about Veeva Systems Inc. (NYSE:VEEV) in its Q2 2022 investor letter:“Veeva Systems Inc. (NYSE:VEEV) is one of the highest quality franchises in our portfolio. The company has the dominant CRM platform for pharmaceutical sales and marketing organizations, and it is replicating that success with the rollout of numerous other modules focused on pharmaceutical customers’ manufacturing, quality, safety and clinical operations. Growth has temporarily slowed over the past year as the company laps difficult YoY comparisons caused by the rapid adoption of their virtual sales call solution during the pandemic. Several large deals also encountered unexpected delays in late 2021. Despite these short-term headwinds, we remain confident in Veeva’s future growth prospects and high-quality business model (~40% free cash flow margins supported by largely recurring subscription revenues). Meanwhile, we believe the defensive nature of its end market (health care) and strategic importance of cloud IT driven transformations could help buffer the company against a weaker global economy. As shares declined in Q2 along with other software stocks, we added to our position.”7. Bio-Rad Laboratories, Inc. (NYSE:BIO)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 45Bio-Rad Laboratories, Inc. (NYSE:BIO) is one of the best medical technology stocks to consider buying. The California-based company manufactures and distributes life science research and clinical diagnostic products in the United States, Europe, Asia, Canada, and Latin America. Bio-Rad Laboratories, Inc. (NYSE:BIO) focuses on selected segments of the life sciences market such as proteomics, genomics, biopharmaceutical production, cellular biology, and food safety. It is one of the leading medical technology stocks to buy. On December 6, RBC Capital analyst Conor McNamara initiated coverage of Bio-Rad Laboratories, Inc. (NYSE:BIO) with an Outperform rating and a $565 price target. He believes shareholders will benefit from ""an extended period of multiple expansion"" as the company continues to deliver revenue acceleration and margin improvement. The stock trades at a 60%-70% discount to peers and with $200 per share in cash and investments has ""the most balance sheet optionality of any company in our sector,"" the analyst noted.According to Insider Monkey’s data, 45 hedge funds were bullish on Bio-Rad Laboratories, Inc. (NYSE:BIO) at the end of the third quarter of 2022, compared to 43 funds in the prior quarter. Israel Englander’s Millennium Management is the biggest position holder in the company, with 458,645 shares worth $191.3 million. 6. Medtronic plc (NYSE:MDT)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 55Medtronic plc (NYSE:MDT) develops, manufactures, and commercializes device-based medical therapies to healthcare systems, physicians, clinicians, and patients worldwide. The company operates through Cardiovascular Portfolio, Medical Surgical Portfolio, Neuroscience Portfolio, and Diabetes Operating Unit segments. On December 8, Medtronic plc (NYSE:MDT) declared a quarterly dividend of $0.68 per share, in line with previous. The dividend is payable on January 13, 2022 to shareholders of record on December 21. The dividend yield on December 19 came in at 3.55%. On November 30, Wells Fargo analyst Larry Biegelsen maintained an Equal Weight rating on Medtronic plc (NYSE:MDT) and trimmed the firm's price target on the shares to $77 from $82. The analyst updated his 2024 and forward EPS forecast for Medtronic plc (NYSE:MDT), as he factored in the FX impact on EPS.According to Insider Monkey’s third quarter database, 55 hedge funds were bullish on Medtronic plc (NYSE:MDT), compared to 54 funds in the earlier quarter. Peter Rathjens, Bruce Clarke, and John Campbell’s Arrowstreet Capital is the largest stakeholder of the company, with 7.16 million shares worth $578.30 million. Like DexCom, Inc. (NASDAQ:DXCM), Intuitive Surgical, Inc. (NASDAQ:ISRG), and Danaher Corporation (NYSE:DHR), Medtronic plc (NYSE:MDT) is one of the best medical technology stocks to invest in. Here is what Artisan Partners specifically said about Medtronic plc (NYSE:MDT) in its Q2 2022 investor letter:“While Medtronic plc (NYSE:MDT)’s procedure volumes recovered to pre-COVID levels, foreign exchange headwinds overshadowed underlying business value growth, and supply chain issues, including those related to China’s lockdowns, impacted the surgical innovations business. The downdraft in the market during the quarter led to a pile-on. We are being patient with our investment in Medtronic because the company continues to be a strong free cash flow generator and is attractively priced, with a FCF yield of 5% on trailing one-year numbers and a dividend yield of 3%. Medtronic is under new management that is focused on growing the company’s top line, reinvesting in R&amp;D, returning cash to shareholders and growing operating profits. We like new management’s strategy and believe new product launches, increased surgery visits, sound M&amp;A transactions and a shareholder returns focus, should reinvigorate the business. We added to our positions in these health care names during the quarter.” Click to continue reading and see 5 Best Medical Technology Stocks To Buy.  Suggested articles:12 Dividend Stocks That Outperform S&amp;P 50010 Stocks Under $5 With High Potential10 Best Performing Technology ETFs in 2022 Disclosure: None. 11 Best Medical Technology Stocks To Buy is originally published on Insider Monkey.]"

That is because the Jan 20, 2023 $95.00 Call had some of the highest implied volatility of all equity options today.What is Implied Volatility?Implied volatility shows how much movement the market is expecting in the future. Options with high levels of implied volatility suggest that investors in the underlying stocks are expecting a big move in one direction or the other. It could also mean there is an event coming up soon that may cause a big rally or a huge sell-off. However, implied volatility is only one piece of the puzzle when putting together an options trading strategy.What do the Analysts Think?Clearly, options traders are pricing in a big move for Whirlpool shares, but what is the fundamental picture for the company? Currently, Whirlpool is a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) in the Household Appliances industry that ranks in the Bottom 33% of our Zacks Industry Rank. Over the last 30 days, no analysts have increased their earnings estimates for the current quarter, while one analyst has revised the estimate downward. The net effect has taken our Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current quarter from $3.28 per share to $3.20 in that period.Given the way analysts feel about Whirlpool right now, this huge implied volatility could mean there’s a trade developing. Oftentimes, options traders look for options with high levels of implied volatility to sell premium. This is a strategy many seasoned traders use because it captures decay. At expiration, the hope for these traders is that the underlying stock does not move as much as originally expected.Looking to Trade Options?Check out the simple yet high-powered approach that Zacks Executive VP Kevin Matras has used to close recent double and triple-digit winners.

At first, an inflation print, which came in below the consensus forecast emboldened the market. However, with the Federal Reserve again raising rates, the specter of a recession rings loudly.Fundamentally, while price spikes may have cooled in intensity, inflation still took its toll on consumers. Evidence came in the form of a disappointing sales report. Therefore, consumers appear intent on battening down the hatches. So, how does this affect the top utility stock picks for 2023? Simply, utilities represent must-have expenditures.Start cutting into critical services such as electrical power and it’s practically game over. Therefore, households will sacrifice just about every item on the budget before thinking about necessary services. While cynical, it’s the overriding reality that may boost the top utility stock picks for 2023.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsDUKDuke Energy$99.78SRESempra Energy$157.96NGGNational Grid$60.68OGEOGE Energy$39.19UGIUGI Corp.$36.57OTTROtter Tail$57.14SPHSuburban Propane Partners$15.70Duke Energy (DUK)The logo for Duke Energy (DUK) is seen on a sign at one of the company's offices.Source: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.comBased in Charlotte, North Carolina, Duke Energy (NYSE:DUK) offers one of the most compelling arguments for the top utility stock picks for 2023: geographic advantages. Per its website, Duke provides energy services to approximately 7.4 million customers in the Carolinas, Florida, Ohio, Kentucky and Indiana and retail natural gas services to more than 1.5 million customers in the Carolinas, Ohio, Kentucky and Tennessee.As macroeconomic conditions worsen, people (particularly younger folks) find living in overhyped metropolitan areas not worth the price. Instead, several states – particularly in the Midwest and along the southeastern coastline – offer attractive alternatives. For instance, the Carolinas consistently attract millennials. Since this is now the power-spending demographic, Duke is positioned where the money will be, not where it was.Story continuesOn a year-to-date basis, DUK finds itself down about 1%. However, near-term momentum has been fairly strong. In the trailing month, shares gained nearly 5%. Given longer-term trends, if you’re patient, DUK ranks among the top utility stock picks for 2023.Sempra Energy (SRE)The logo for Sempra (SRE) is seen at the top of an office building.Source: Michael Vi / Shutterstock.comSpeaking from both personal observation and from reading various news reports, Sempra Energy (NYSE:SRE) has a checkered past regarding the Southern Californian regions it serves. Headquartered in San Diego, America’s Finest City may not have America’s finest utility company. This year, protestors called out Sempra for environmental degradation. Despite the weather cooling in recent months, protestors remain fired up.Now, I’m mentioning this not to pour salt on Sempra’s wounds but rather to demonstrate its cynical resilience. No matter how much outrage targets Sempra, SRE stock still chugs along. Since the start of the year, shares gained nearly 23% of equity value. Further, in the market fallout of Dec. 15, SRE only lost a little more than 1%. In contrast, the benchmark equities index slipped 2.5%.Love it or hate it, California represents the economic engine of this country. Further, the latest data suggests that the Golden State alone stands poised to become the fourth-largest economy, surpassing Germany. Sempra isn’t going anywhere. This makes it one of the top utility stock picks for 2023.National Grid (NGG)A concept image of electricity flowing between two disconnected electric cables.Source: ESB Professional / Shutterstock.comWhen it comes to deciphering the top utility stock picks for 2023, it’s probably best for investors to bulk up on domestic players. To paraphrase the legendary Warren Buffett, invest in what you know. Nevertheless, if you want to get a bit adventurous in this otherwise boring sector, you may consider National Grid (NYSE:NGG).Based in the U.K., National Grid owns and operates electricity and natural gas transmission networks. However, it also operates transmission networks in the northwestern region of the U.S. Since the beginning of this year, NGG slipped 14%. However, in the trailing month, shares gained nearly 4%, possibly reflecting a recovery initiative.Better yet, for those seeking discounts in their top utility stock picks for 2023, National Grid rates as undervalued. Currently, the market prices NGG at 13.85 times forward earnings. In contrast, the sector median value is 16.5 times.OGE Energy (OGE)Person holding the glowing world in their hands with icons with different types of energy. Energy stocks; energy storageSource: PopTika / ShutterstockHeadquartered in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, OGE Energy (NYSE:OGE) is a holding company that investments in energy and energy services providers. Per its website, OGE offers physical delivery and related services for electricity in its home state and western Arkansas. At time of writing, the company commands a market capitalization of just under $8 billion.On a technical level, OGE ranks among the top utility stock picks for 2023 due to its underlying stability. Since its Jan. opener, OGE gained over 5% of equity value. Further, momentum has been strong in the back half of the year. In the trailing six-month period, OGE returned shareholders almost 14%. As well, it’s worth noting that the company carries a forward yield of 4.13%.On a fundamental level, OGE is undervalued. Presently, the market prices shares at 8.7 times trailing-12-month earnings. In contrast, the sector median value is 16.5 times. Also, OGE’s return on equity pings at 22.4%, reflecting superior capacity in converting equity financing into profits.UGI Corp (UGI)Large tanker ship carrying natural gas at dusk in harborSource: shutterstock.com/Wojciech WrzesienOperating out of King of Prussia, Pennsylvania, UGI Corp (NYSE:UGI) is a natural gas and electric power distribution company. Per its website, UGI owns AmeriGas, the largest propane marketer in the United States. UGI also owns AvantiGas, Antargaz and Flaga in Europe. Currently, the company carries a market cap of nearly $8 billion.On paper, UGI may represent one of the top utility stock picks for 2023 but for contrarians. Since the start of this year, shares gave up nearly 17% of market value. To be sure, the second half has been more auspicious for UGI, losing only half a percent. Also, in the trailing month, UGI actually gained a hair over 3%.It’s the fundamentals, though, that should attract the most attention. At the moment, the market prices UGI at 12-times forward earnings. This compares favorably to the industry median of 16.5 times. In addition, UGI’s Shiller price-earnings ratio is only 11 times, ranking favorably below nearly 68% of the competition.Otter Tail (OTTR)a hand holding a lightbulb on a green background to represent renewable energy stocksSource: ShutterstockHeadquartered in Fergus Falls, Minnesota, Otter Tail (NASDAQ:OTTR) is an energy firm whose main subsidiary is the Otter Tail Power Company. Per its public profile, this subsidiary serves at least 423 towns at retail and delivers power to about 14 municipal utilities.Fundamentally, as a small regional player, Otter Tail carries a high-risk, high-reward profile. For example, OTTR shares slipped nearly 18% of equity value since the start of the year. Also, it’s been a volatile ride in the back half of 2022 when other top utility stock picks for 2023 performed much better. Still, it started to show some signs of life recently. In the trailing month, OTTR gained nearly 4%.While some might overlook Otter Tail, it would be a mistake. For one thing, the market prices OTTR at only 8.2-times trailing earnings, below 78% of the competition. Second, the company features solid revenue growth in the past three years at 7.6% (relative to the industry). Finally, its ROE of nearly 28% reflects a very high-quality business.Suburban Propane Partners (SPH)image of businessman holding a fiery arrow that's heading in an upward trajectorySource: ShutterstockHeadquartered in Whippany, New Jersey, Suburban Propane Partners (NYSE:SPH) is a nationwide marketer and distributor of a diverse array of products to meet the energy needs of its customers. Specifically, Suburban Propane specializes in heating oil, refined fuels and of course its namesake energy commodity. In addition, the company markets natural gas and electricity in deregulated markets.At the moment, SPH features a market cap of just over $1 billion, making it one of the small-cap players among the top utility stock picks for 2023. Since the January opener, shares gained 5%, a very respectable figure given the circumstances. Over the trailing year, SPH returned 12% of equity value for shareholders, suggesting a steadily brewing bullish narrative.As with many of the other names on this list of top utility stock picks for 2023, SPH rates as undervalued. In particular, the market prices SPH at 7.3-times trailing earnings. In contrast, the sector median value is 16.5 times or below roughly 84% of the competition.On the date of publication, Josh Enomoto did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.A former senior business analyst for Sony Electronics, Josh Enomoto has helped broker major contracts with Fortune Global 500 companies.

Even after accounting for the recent loss, the US$5.5m worth of stock purchased by them is now worth US$5.7m or in other words, their investment continues to give good returns.While we would never suggest that investors should base their decisions solely on what the directors of a company have been doing, we do think it is perfectly logical to keep tabs on what insiders are doing. See our latest analysis for General Electric General Electric Insider Transactions Over The Last YearOver the last year, we can see that the biggest insider purchase was by Chairman &amp; CEO H. Culp for US$4.8m worth of shares, at about US$75.26 per share. That implies that an insider found the current price of US$78.06 per share to be enticing. While their view may have changed since the purchase was made, this does at least suggest they have had confidence in the company's future. If someone buys shares at well below current prices, it's a good sign on balance, but keep in mind they may no longer see value. Happily, the General Electric insiders decided to buy shares at close to current prices.In the last twelve months insiders purchased 73.54k shares for US$5.5m. On the other hand they divested 1.44k shares, for US$107k. Overall, General Electric insiders were net buyers during the last year.

You probably do not want to miss this free list of growing companies that insiders are buying.Insider Ownership Of General ElectricAnother way to test the alignment between the leaders of a company and other shareholders is to look at how many shares they own. I reckon it's a good sign if insiders own a significant number of shares in the company. General Electric insiders own about US$209m worth of shares (which is 0.2% of the company). Most shareholders would be happy to see this sort of insider ownership, since it suggests that management incentives are well aligned with other shareholders.Story continuesWhat Might The Insider Transactions At General Electric Tell Us?The fact that there have been no General Electric insider transactions recently certainly doesn't bother us. But insiders have shown more of an appetite for the stock, over the last year.

For more companies, head on over to Top 5 3D Printing Companies in the World. If there is one technology that would appear like magic to prehistoric humans, or even dwellers of the 19th century, it is 3D printing. The sight of a printer simply producing metal objects that would previously take painstaking forging to manufacture is nothing short of astounding. Therefore, it is natural that the 3D printing industry is one of the most lucrative and fastest growing in the world.For instance, a research report from Strategic Market Research estimates that the industry was worth $14 billion in 2021 and it will grow at a whopping compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) of 21% to sit at $77 billion by the end of 2030. Dividing the market in terms of printers and materials, the research firm reveals that industrial printers held the dominating position by accounting for 70% of the market and that metals were the most widely used material as they accounted for more than 50% of all the materials used. Additionally, Strategic Market Research also shares that the automotive industry is the largest user of 3D printing and that most of the overall use of the machines involves manufacturing prototypes. As is the case with most advanced technologies markets, such as biotechnology and artificial intelligence, North America was the largest 3D printing market in 2021 as it represented roughly 30% of the total market.Another report, this time from Fortune Business Insights, has an even stronger growth rate for 3D printing. It believes that the industry was worth $15 billion in 2021, and from then until 2029, the sector will grow at an unbelievable 24.3% CAGR to sit at $83.9 billion. This report concurs with the previous one to claim that prototyping was the largest use for 3D printers and that North America is a global leader. Fortune Business Insights also outlines that new age technologies such as robotics, the Internet of Things (IoT), and artificial intelligence will simulate the industrial adoption of 3D printers.Story continuesA heavy user of 3D printing is the aerospace industry. Modern day jet engines have thousands of components, and some of these, such as the turbine blades, need to be built to exacting specifications and with a single mold of material. Some engine components that use 3D printing are turbocharger impellers, blades, fuel nozzles, and other parts.

363,c4c337d8-333e-32c4-963e-a83b2f55bcd4,UNH,2022-12-20,"‘Load Up,’ Says Jim Cramer About These 2 ‘Strong Buy’ Healthcare Stocks",TipRanks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/load-says-jim-cramer-2-174130039.html,1671471690,STORY,['UNH'],"[Against a backdrop of soaring inflation, a slowing economy and persistent rate hikes, assessing the playbook for the coming year, CNBC’s Jim Cramer says it’s more important than ever to look at the past year and see what worked. Basically, which stocks have managed to overcome the bear conditions.Within the components of the S&amp;P 500, energy and utilities have been segments that have beaten the broader market, and generally speaking, so have those of the healthcare sector.But healthcare stocks, of course, are a varied bunch, and run the gamut from Big Pharma to hospital operators to medical device makers to small biotechs yet to notch any sales. Right now, however, says the Mad Money host, of all the stocks on offer, it’s clear what the market wants.“Wall Street likes profitable companies with consistent results, nice dividends and reasonably valued stocks,” he said. And the healthcare sector has some of those; “boring, consistent operators with cheap stocks” - these have been 2022’s winners. And such names are going to keep outperforming, according to Cramer.With this in mind, let’s look at two big, dependable names Cramer thinks investors should be loading up on right now. We’ve used the TipRanks database to see whether the Street’s analysts agree with these picks. As it turns out, each stock has received enough bullish calls over the last three months to give it a “Strong Buy” consensus rating.Humana Inc. (HUM)If you are looking for big, profitable, healthcare giants, then look no further. Humana, the first Cramer pick, took the 41st spot last year on the Fortune 500 list and is currently the U.S.’s fourth biggest health insurance provider.It also helps in the current climate that the bulk of Humana's revenues are generated from government-sponsored programs, which provide the company with a regular and reliable income stream few can match. And in the difficult current climate that has been a real boon, as was clear to see in the latest earnings report.Story continuesQ3 revenue grew by 10.16% year-over-year to $22.80 billion, boosted by an uptick in Medicare Advantage members and premiums. The bottom-line performance was especially impressive; adj. EPS climbed by 42% compared to the same period last year, coming in at $6.88, far above the $6.28 expected by the analysts. Humana also announced an accelerated $1 billion share buyback program, which is set to conclude in Q4.Cramer calls HUM stock a “great turnaround story,” and he's not alone in his bullish outlook. Morgan Stanley analyst Michael Ha also sees the company in a strong position heading into 2023.""We believe Humana's investments into 2023 has led to an unprecedented improvement in benefit richness we have not historically seen from any traditional MA plan (w/ market share of at least 5%)... Looking forward, we do not see any swing factors material enough to knock Humana off course on 2023G EPS and believe 2023 membership growth marks the beginning of an increasingly powerful multi-year earnings growth story,"" Ha opined.To this end, Ha rates HUM shares an Overweight (i.e., Buy), backed by a $620 price target. How does this translate to investors? There’s upside of ~26% from current levels. (To watch Ha’s track record, click here)Overall, the Street is confident in Humana’s ongoing success; one analyst prefers sitting this one out, but all 14 other recent reviews are positive, naturally providing the stock with a Strong Buy consensus rating. At $622.73, the average target represents one-year returns of ~23%. (See Humana stock forecast on TipRanks)UnitedHealth Group (UNH)Hardly any come bigger or more dependable than the next Cramer-endorsed healthcare stock, which not for nothing he calls “best-of-breed.”UnitedHealth is one of the world’s biggest revenue generators with a market cap of $489 billion. Offering healthcare products and insurance services, its operations are divided into two distinct segments; UnitedHealthcare, which provides health insurance, and Optum, a provider of data and technology services.As the leading player in a growing worldwide health insurance industry, it’s no surprise to learn the stock has been able to outperform the S&amp;P 500 in nine out of the last 10 years, 2022 included.In the most recently reported quarter, for Q3, revenue grew by 12% year-over-year to $80.9 billion, with both Optum and UnitedHealthcare displaying double-digit growth. Adj. EPS of $5.79 increased by 28% from the same period a year ago, while also beating the Street’s $5.43 forecast. The company also raised its full year 2022 net earnings outlook.On the dividend front, the current quarterly $1.65 payout yields a modest 1.26%, but the dividend payout ratio will be roughly only 30% this year. This gives the company plenty of cash for potential future expansion projects and to settle its debt. It could also enable the company to hike the dividend over the next few years.This stock has caught the attention of 5-star analyst George Hill, from Deutsche Bank, who writes, ""UNH has a long track record of under-promising and over-delivering... We continue to see the company as the high-quality defensive name in the large cap healthcare services space given UNH’s increasing diversification into complementary businesses and the continued erosion of regulatory risks, which is reflected in the premium we granted in our target multiple.”All told, Hill rates UNH stock as a Buy while his $615 price target suggests shares will climb 17% higher over the coming year. (To watch Hill’s track record, click here)In general, other analysts also like what they’re seeing. 11 Buys and 3 Holds add up to a Strong Buy consensus rating. Based on the $602.64 average price target, the upside potential comes in at ~15%.

For more countries, head on over to 5 Countries That Produce the Best Cosmetics in the World. Cosmetics, commonly known as makeup, are among the oldest products in the world. The industry has evolved massively over the past few decades and now uses advanced research to produce products for skin care, hair care, makeup, and a laundry list of other uses.Naturally, these use cases also make the cosmetics industry one of the largest in the world. Overall, the sector is dominated by a couple of large multinational players who spend billions of dollars on product development and marketing. According to the research firm Allied Market Research, the global cosmetics industry was worth $380 billion in 2019 and it will grow at a compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) of 5.3% to be worth $463 billion by the end of 2027. The industry is undergoing important shifts these days, with the focus on health, sustainability, and environmental friendliness compelling firms to move to recyclable packaging and natural ingredients. The research firm estimates that the skin and sun care market was the largest segment in 2019 and it will retain this share over the course of the forecast period. However, in terms of growth, the fragrance market is thought to be the strongest segment. Additionally, changing views about gender will also impact the cosmetics industry, with Allied Market Research estimating that the unisex cosmetics segment will outpace the broader market and grow at a 6.6% CAGR.Another report, this time from Fortune Business Insights, has similar estimates for the industry. It values the market at $284 billion in 2021 and pegs it with a CAGR of 5% for the time period between 2021 and 2028 for a final worth of $415 billion. It segregates the market geographically to outline that Asia Pacific was the largest segment in 2020, as it was worth roughly half of the entire market or $105 billion. However, Fortune Business Insights adds that North America will grow strongly due to higher purchasing power and a growth of salons in the region.Story continuesThe cosmetics industry is also making use of advanced technologies such as artificial intelligence (AI). For instance, L'Occitane International (SEHK:973.HK) allows its customers to use an AI powered countertop device to figure out their skin type. Once the type has been determined, the machine then provides the customer with a suitable skin cream that is freshly blended. Additionally, L'Oréal S.A. (EPA:OR.PA)'s subsidiary Lancôme uses a foundation machine to create a skin tone profile with the help of a colorimeter. This profile is then run through an algorithm to sift the right foundation from 20,000 different types in Lancôme's database. A machine mixes the right foundation right at the shop, just like L'Occitane's skin cream machine.Taiwan's New Kinpo Group has a smart mirror that provides users with a 'skin age'. This metric includes details such as pore density and wrinkles and is used to recommend products to customers. These uses are only a handful that is used in the cosmetics industry since it is heavily focused on improving personal appearance and therefore have a strong potential for interactions between the customer and the company.In terms of research going on in the industry right now, these days it is all about using stem cells to either reverse hair loss or improve hair growth. Researchers have shown that there is hope for using stem cells to regrow hair, and several companies offer products along these lines. These include Stemson Therapeutics, LLC, which uses induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) to create cells that lie at the very start of hair growth. Another stem cell solution maker is Italian firm Framesi Milan whose stem cell hair serums use apple and other stem cells to increase the blood flow in the scalp.Some notable names in the cosmetics and beauty industry include The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG), Ulta Beauty, Inc. (NASDAQ:ULTA), and The Estée Lauder Companies Inc. (NYSE:EL).Sorbis/Shutterstock.comOur Methodology We consulted global trade data to sift out which countries export the most makeup products.

367,e556b1d1-68bd-3e37-b5bd-d453646e7649,PG,2022-12-20,12 Countries That Produce the Best Cosmetics in the World,Insider Monkey,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/12-countries-produce-best-cosmetics-204242581.html,1671482562,STORY,"['PG', 'ULTA', 'EL']","[In this piece, we will take a look at the 12 countries that produce the best cosmetics in the world. For more countries, head on over to 5 Countries That Produce the Best Cosmetics in the World. Cosmetics, commonly known as makeup, are among the oldest products in the world. The industry has evolved massively over the past few decades and now uses advanced research to produce products for skin care, hair care, makeup, and a laundry list of other uses.Naturally, these use cases also make the cosmetics industry one of the largest in the world. Overall, the sector is dominated by a couple of large multinational players who spend billions of dollars on product development and marketing. According to the research firm Allied Market Research, the global cosmetics industry was worth $380 billion in 2019 and it will grow at a compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) of 5.3% to be worth $463 billion by the end of 2027. The industry is undergoing important shifts these days, with the focus on health, sustainability, and environmental friendliness compelling firms to move to recyclable packaging and natural ingredients. The research firm estimates that the skin and sun care market was the largest segment in 2019 and it will retain this share over the course of the forecast period. However, in terms of growth, the fragrance market is thought to be the strongest segment. Additionally, changing views about gender will also impact the cosmetics industry, with Allied Market Research estimating that the unisex cosmetics segment will outpace the broader market and grow at a 6.6% CAGR.Another report, this time from Fortune Business Insights, has similar estimates for the industry. It values the market at $284 billion in 2021 and pegs it with a CAGR of 5% for the time period between 2021 and 2028 for a final worth of $415 billion. It segregates the market geographically to outline that Asia Pacific was the largest segment in 2020, as it was worth roughly half of the entire market or $105 billion. However, Fortune Business Insights adds that North America will grow strongly due to higher purchasing power and a growth of salons in the region.Story continuesThe cosmetics industry is also making use of advanced technologies such as artificial intelligence (AI). For instance, L'Occitane International (SEHK:973.HK) allows its customers to use an AI powered countertop device to figure out their skin type. Once the type has been determined, the machine then provides the customer with a suitable skin cream that is freshly blended. Additionally, L'Oréal S.A. (EPA:OR.PA)'s subsidiary Lancôme uses a foundation machine to create a skin tone profile with the help of a colorimeter. This profile is then run through an algorithm to sift the right foundation from 20,000 different types in Lancôme's database. A machine mixes the right foundation right at the shop, just like L'Occitane's skin cream machine.Taiwan's New Kinpo Group has a smart mirror that provides users with a 'skin age'. This metric includes details such as pore density and wrinkles and is used to recommend products to customers. These uses are only a handful that is used in the cosmetics industry since it is heavily focused on improving personal appearance and therefore have a strong potential for interactions between the customer and the company.In terms of research going on in the industry right now, these days it is all about using stem cells to either reverse hair loss or improve hair growth. Researchers have shown that there is hope for using stem cells to regrow hair, and several companies offer products along these lines. These include Stemson Therapeutics, LLC, which uses induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) to create cells that lie at the very start of hair growth. Another stem cell solution maker is Italian firm Framesi Milan whose stem cell hair serums use apple and other stem cells to increase the blood flow in the scalp.Some notable names in the cosmetics and beauty industry include The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG), Ulta Beauty, Inc. (NASDAQ:ULTA), and The Estée Lauder Companies Inc. (NYSE:EL).Sorbis/Shutterstock.comOur Methodology We consulted global trade data to sift out which countries export the most makeup products.

Wall Street clearly dives into all of the other metrics and management's input, but the EPS figure helps cut through all the noise.We know earnings results are vital, but how a company performs compared to bottom line expectations can be even more important when it comes to stock prices, especially in the near-term. This means that investors might want to take advantage of these earnings surprises.2 Stocks to Add to Your WatchlistThe Zacks Expected Surprise Prediction, or ESP, works by locking in on the most up-to-date analyst earnings revisions because they can be more accurate than estimates from weeks or even months before the actual release date. The thinking is pretty straightforward: analysts who provide earnings estimates closer to the report are likely to have more information. With this in mind, the Expected Surprise Prediction compares the Most Accurate Estimate (being the most recent) against the overall Zacks Consensus Estimate. The percentage difference provides the ESP figure.Now that we understand what the ESP is and how beneficial it can be, let's dive into a stock that currently fits the bill. Procter &amp; Gamble (PG) earns a Zacks Rank #3 right now and its Most Accurate Estimate sits at $1.58 a share, just 30 days from its upcoming earnings release on January 18, 2023.By taking the percentage difference between the $1.58 Most Accurate Estimate and the $1.57 Zacks Consensus Estimate, Procter &amp; Gamble has an Earnings ESP of 0.25%.PG is one of just a large database of Consumer Staples stocks with positive ESPs. Another solid-looking stock is Anheuser-Busch Inbev (BUD).Anheuser-Busch Inbev is a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock, and is getting ready to report earnings on February 23, 2023. BUD's Most Accurate Estimate sits at $0.98 a share 66 days from its next earnings release.For Anheuser-Busch Inbev, the percentage difference between its Most Accurate Estimate and its Zacks Consensus Estimate of $0.86 is 14.62%.Story continuesBecause both stocks hold a positive Earnings ESP, PG and BUD could potentially post earnings beats in their next reports.Find Stocks to Buy or Sell Before They're ReportedUse the Zacks Earnings ESP Filter to turn up stocks with the highest probability of positively, or negatively, surprising to buy or sell before they're reported for profitable earnings season trading.

370,e7a95b35-f170-3d33-aa98-a8b3559e5ae2,SLG,2022-12-20,Analysts Just Downgraded These 2 REITs,Benzinga,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/analysts-just-downgraded-2-reits-172528912.html,1671470728.0,STORY,"['AVB', 'SLG-PI']","[Analyst downgrades hurt.Investors can awaken any morning to find one of their stocks down heavily following an analyst downgrade. The stock may retreat even further as word spreads.Often it’s a reaction to a stock that has run up and seems overbought. But other times, as with many real estate investment trusts (REITs) in 2022, the downgrades come after a stock has already been clobbered.The two REITs below received downgrades from multiple analysts within the past few weeks. But are these downgrades deserved? Take a look and decide for yourself.AvalonBay Communities Inc. (NYSE: AVB) is a residential REIT that acquires, develops and manages multifamily communities. As of Sept. 30, 2022, AvalonBay Communities owned directly or indirectly 88,405 apartments in 293 communities across 12 states and Washington, D.C. The 52-week range is $158.35 to $259.05, and the most recent closing price was $168.79.AvalonBay Communities has had a successful 24 years, averaging 8.5% total returns annually. Despite this worthy record, it’s had several recent analyst downgrades.On Dec. 7, analyst Adam Kramer of Aperture Investors downgraded AvalonBay Communities from Overweight to Equal-Weight, while lowering his price target from $225 to $187. The next day, Goldman Sachs analyst Chandni Luthra downgraded AvalonBay Communities from Buy to Neutral, while lowering its price target from $197 to $187.On Dec. 16, JPMorgan downgraded AvalonBay Communities from Neutral to Underweight and lowered the price target from $206 to $197.These downgrades were initiated despite AvalonBay Communities having posted third-quarter funds from operations (FFO) of $2.50, an increase of 21% from the third quarter of 2021. Revenue also increased by 14.5% from the third quarter of 2021.Looking ahead, analysts are worried about the Federal Reserve creating a recession in 2023 from the ongoing increases in interest rates. Rental rates have already begun to soften, but that’s following a major increase over the past two years.Story continuesAnother factor for the downgrades was that AvalonBay Communities revised its 2022 core FFO from its previous $9.76 to $9.96 to a lower range of $9.74 to $9.84.AvalonBay Communities has been able to shrug off these analyst downgrades with its share price up about $2 since the Dec. 7 downgrade.SL Green Realty Corp. (NYSE: SLG) is the largest owner and landlord of New York City office buildings, holding an interest in 62 buildings totaling 33.6 million square feet.SL Green Realty recently cut its monthly dividend 12.9%, from $0.3108 to $0.2708, but the annual yield is still 9.1% and the dividend/FFO payout ratio is only about 55%. Recent third-quarter earnings and revenue were also well below the third quarter 2021.SL Green Realty had already lost almost half its value in 2022, but that didn’t stop multiple analysts from recently downgrading it further.On Dec. 6, John Kim of BMO Capital Markets downgraded SL Green Realty from Outperform to Market Perform and lowered his price target from $47 to $41. The same day, Nicholas Yulico of Scotiabank downgraded SL Green Realty from Sector Perform to Sector Underperform and lowered the price target from $43 to $34. Yulico said that given high leverage and downside earnings risk, he expects future dividend cuts are likely.Within two days of the downgrades, SL Green Realty dropped another 8%. So unlike AvalonBay Communities, SL Green was unable to shrug off the analyst downgrades.On Dec. 13, Nicholas Joseph of Citigroup also downgraded SL Green Realty from Neutral to Sell, while lowering the price target from $35 to $30.But SL Green Realty has some positive news of late. It recently celebrated the topping out —when the last beam is placed on a building during construction — of One Madison Avenue. The building is 55% preleased, with construction expected to be completed next November.SL Green Realty recently partnered with Caesars Entertainment to bid on redeveloping a 54-story building in Times Square to house a new casino and theater. If SL Green Realty wins that bid, it could propel the stock price much higher.Investors should keep in mind that analysts are not always right, but they can have an effect upon share prices.Weekly REIT Report: REITs are one of the most misunderstood investment options, making it difficult for investors to spot incredible opportunities until it’s too late.

To keep the lesson grounded in practicality, we'll use ROE to better understand UDR, Inc. (NYSE:UDR).Return on Equity or ROE is a test of how effectively a company is growing its value and managing investors’ money. In simpler terms, it measures the profitability of a company in relation to shareholder's equity. Check out our latest analysis for UDR How Do You Calculate Return On Equity?Return on equity can be calculated by using the formula:Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' EquitySo, based on the above formula, the ROE for UDR is:3.5% = US$171m ÷ US$4.9b (Based on the trailing twelve months to September 2022).The 'return' refers to a company's earnings over the last year. That means that for every $1 worth of shareholders' equity, the company generated $0.04 in profit.Does UDR Have A Good ROE?Arguably the easiest way to assess company's ROE is to compare it with the average in its industry. Importantly, this is far from a perfect measure, because companies differ significantly within the same industry classification. As shown in the graphic below, UDR has a lower ROE than the average (6.9%) in the REITs industry classification.roeThat's not what we like to see. However, a low ROE is not always bad. If the company's debt levels are moderate to low, then there's still a chance that returns can be improved via the use of financial leverage. When a company has low ROE but high debt levels, we would be cautious as the risk involved is too high. You can see the 4 risks we have identified for UDR by visiting our risks dashboard for free  on our platform here.Why You Should Consider Debt When Looking At ROEMost companies need money -- from somewhere -- to grow their profits. The cash for investment can come from prior year profits (retained earnings), issuing new shares, or borrowing. In the case of the first and second options, the ROE will reflect this use of cash, for growth. In the latter case, the debt used for growth will improve returns, but won't affect the total equity. Thus the use of debt can improve ROE, albeit along with extra risk in the case of stormy weather, metaphorically speaking.Story continuesUDR's Debt And Its 3.5% ROEIt's worth noting the high use of debt by UDR, leading to its debt to equity ratio of 1.16. Its ROE is quite low, even with the use of significant debt; that's not a good result, in our opinion. Debt increases risk and reduces options for the company in the future, so you generally want to see some good returns from using it.SummaryReturn on equity is a useful indicator of the ability of a business to generate profits and return them to shareholders. In our books, the highest quality companies have high return on equity, despite low debt. All else being equal, a higher ROE is better.But when a business is high quality, the market often bids it up to a price that reflects this. It is important to consider other factors, such as future profit growth -- and how much investment is required going forward.

Homebuilder stocks are suffering.There are many reasons for this. Boomers refuse to move out. Millennial buyers can’t move in. So-called “starter homes” that brought generations into the market are now unaffordable for many.The problem is homebuyers don’t just buy houses. We also buy the money to buy houses. For the first time in decades, that debt costs a lot, with interest rates for 30-year mortgages now well over 6%.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsWhen was the last time the market was this bad? It was when I bought my first house. I paid $49,500 in 1984. That’s the equivalent of $142,000 today. But I also paid 13% to finance the purchase. In terms of affordability, we’re in the same place we were back then.Housing stocks are now super-cheap, most selling for price-to-earnings ratios around 5-times. But many analysts are still warning investors away. They see falling sales, rising costs, and big trouble ahead.Why would anyone consider investing in the stock of a company that builds houses? Because recessions end, interest rates fluctuate, and this, too, shall pass. Because, in many cases, investors are fearing the future and ignoring the present.I am not the only one who believes this. Warren Buffett of Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRK-A) believes it, too. Why else would he buy 7% of building supplier Louisiana-Pacific (NYSE:LP)?Those who are bullish on housing say the builders are a lot like Louisiana-Pacific. No one wants them, so now is the time to look at them.On the theory that the harder they fall the faster they rise, here are five homebuilders to put on your radar. Those that have fallen hardest in 2022 are listed first, and those that have fallen the least are listed last.TOLToll Brothers$50.08MTHMeritage Homes$92.29LENLennar$91.99PHMPulte Group$45.83DRID.R.

Shares opened the year near $70 and will likely close near $50. But if you think the high end of the housing market will rebound first in 2023, this may be among the homebuilder stocks you’re looking for.Business at Toll Brothers isn’t bad. It’s quite good. For the three months ending in October, the company handily beat estimates with earnings of $640.5 million, or $5.63 per share, on revenue of $3.58 billion. It sold 3,765 homes with an average price near $1 million during the quarter. Additionally, the company reported a backlog of nearly 8,100 homes at the end of the period. Deliveries for the current quarter were estimated at 1,750-1,850 homes, or 8,000-9,000 for the coming fiscal year.However, Toll Brothers’ stock keeps getting hammered. It’s now trading right at its book value. The company’s price-to-earnings ratio is below 4.5. Its modest dividend of 19 cents per share still yields 1.58%. Yet, the average price target at Tipranks is just $55.20, 13% ahead of where it traded December 12.There is ample evidence for the short-term slowdown Toll Brothers expects. This is especially true for infill projects inside cities. A project around the corner from me is being slow-walked, the construction loan kept open in hopes a higher-interest mortgage won’t be needed. But the company is also still announcing larger suburban projects, like a 290-unit development in suburban Chamblee due for completion in 2024.The bear case for Toll Brothers stock is based on fear. High-priced homes and high-priced money are a wicked combination. But luxury homes are often bought for cash, by people who already own homes. Toll doubled-down on the infill segment in 2020, buying Sharp Homes and then Thrive Residential.If the coming recession doesn’t become a depression, Toll’s careful planning in 2022 should pay dividends for stockholders in what I view as one of the best homebuilder stocks out there.Meritage Homes (MTH)homebuildersSource: ©iStock.com/SashickIf the thesis behind Toll Brothers intrigues you, you can double down on it with a small bet on Meritage Homes (NYSE:MTH). The stock is down nearly 26% in 2022, but was recently rising off October lows of under $67.That’s because the Scottsdale, Arizona-based company has grown steadily for years, and is consistently profitable. Investors’ fears about the future has it selling at just $93 per share on December 13, or 3.6-times earnings. Additionally, the company’s market cap of $3.4 billion is just 60% of 2022’s sales. Those are the numbers of a low-margin retailer, not a company that brought 14% of revenue to its net income line last year.Even inside Meritage, confidence is low. Independent director Peter Axe sold $500,000 of stock recently, but most other insiders are hanging in. Like everyone else, they’re worried about plunging sales in the face of declining supply.The reason for the worry is interest rates. With rates at up to 7.5% on a 30-year mortgage, even for those who put 20% down, qualified buyers are hard to find.The question is, what if we’ve hit the peak in interest rates, as recent inflation data suggests? Inflation was 7.1% for the year ending in November, but up just 0.1% month-over month. Prices are falling for energy, rents, and many commodities. Maybe the market gets a spring thaw.If we do get a soft landing, the high end of the market should get help first. You’re highly leveraged to that on Meritage stock. Some analysts are already raising their ratings on Meritage. Zacks calls it a top momentum stock for the long term.Lennar (LEN)Lennar (LEN) website homepage. Lennar logo visible on the phone screenSource: madamF via ShutterstockLennar (NYSE:LEN) is the second-largest company among homebuilder stocks on this list, with a market cap of $26 billion. That’s down 21% for 2022, but the trend has been up since October, when it bottomed at $71. The stock was trading December 13 at over $91.Lennar is four-times bigger than Meritage, large enough to have sophisticated financial management. It also has imagination, evidenced by a small community of homes outside Austin, Texas it is building using 3D printing technologies.As the market seized up this fall, Lennar publicly offered to sell 5,000 new homes to big landlords, selling entire subdivisions at once. The average Lennar home sells for $500,000, but buying in bulk can bring big discounts.Those buyers may not exist, however. Blackstone (NYSE:BX) recently limited withdrawals from its residential housing fund. Some sales contracts have been cancelled.Lennar’s most recent earnings report showed net earnings per share up 11% and home deliveries up 13%. But that included 1,000 sales to rental operators, including its own operation, which has $1.25 billion in loans committed for such purchases. The company’s total long-term debt was nearly unchanged from a year earlier at $5.7 billion, with $13 billion in finished homes in inventory and cash of $1.5 billion.Anyone interested in buying a housing stock should look closely at Lennar’s November quarter numbers, which were due to be released December 15. These will give a good indication of the sector’s health.If Lennar’s numbers are better than feared, the stock should rise. The stock’s price-to-earnings ratio is just 6-times, and you get a 37.5 cent per share dividend that yields 1.7%. Most analysts seem to be holding their breath, maintaining their ratings, but with one-year price targets that are all over the map, from a low of $72 to a high of $133.PulteGroup (PHM)the PulteGroup logo seen displayed on a smartphoneSource: rafapress / Shutterstock.comPulteGroup (NYSE:PHM) stock was selling in mid-December for just 4.7-times earnings, after increasing its dividend for the fifth year in a row. Pulte’s target market is millennials and their boomer parents, with 43% of homes aimed at first-time buyers and 25% “active adult” communities under the DelWebb and DiVosta brands.The is among the homebuilder stocks with a bullish chart pattern that can’t get any love. Zacks recently rated the stock a strong sell because of what it called a “challenging housing market” in 2023.Their evidence comes from Pulte’s third quarter report. The company posted a miss on earnings at $2.69 per share, on revenue of $3.94 billion. But the miss was by just 4 cents per share. Earnings were up 48% year-over-year, with gross margins rising to over 30%.Management isn’t acting like a hard recession is coming. The cash balance of most homebuilder stocks is something to watch. In this case, company’s cash balance is down $1.5 billion in 2022. It all went into inventories of homes and land. That may be because Pulte is five years past a very public spat between founder Bill Pulte and William Dugas, who moved the company to Atlanta from Detroit. Dugas was pushed out in 2017 and replaced by current CEO James Marshall. Pulte died in 2018 and his grandson, who acted as his spokesman during the fight, is now building a new company as The Pulte Family. I believe the aggressive growth plan being pursued by Marshall today is a Pulte legacy.If the coming recession is worse than now feared, and if car-oriented suburbs are on the way out, then Pulte does have problems. But I don’t think that’s the way to bet.D.R. Horton (DHI)In this photo illustration the D.R. Horton (DRI) logo seen displayed on a smartphone.Source: Casimiro PT / Shutterstock.comIf you’re going to bet big, you’ll want to consider the biggest player among homebuilder stocks, D.R. Horton (NYSE:DHI). That’s the way Wall Street looks at it, too. The stock is down 19% in 2022, but that’s just slightly below the year’s fall in the average S&amp;P stock, which was down 16% in mid-December.Horton stands tall in terms of its financial strength. The Arlington, Texas company has a market cap of $30 billion, but that’s just 5.3-times last year’s earnings. Even if the company hits current estimates of a drop to $9.70 per share in earnings, it would have a price-earnings ratio of less than 9-times next year.Analysts worried about the sector insist DHI stock could fall 50% this year, but the company seems aware of the risks. In September, it held $2.57 billion in cash against an inventory of $21.66 billion in houses and land.As I wrote nearly three years ago, when DHI stock was 47% cheaper than today, Horton is a bet on the durability of American suburbs, the idea of “driving until you qualify” for a place to raise your kids. The model seemed under threat in the last decade, as young people flocked to cities, but the pandemic has given it new life.D.R. Horton builds homes for varying price points. They’re often of cookie-cutter construction, a problem when the environment won’t cooperate. The company and its critics are known for playing hardball, sometimes to a humorous extent. But it usually wins.Someday, the D.R. Horton model of suburbs far from jobs will stop working. But today is not that day. Barclay’s (NYSE:BCS) recently boosted its target on the stock to $108. If the coming housing recession is mild, it could easily clear that.On the date of publication, Dana Blankenhorn held no positions in any companies mentioned in this article.

Happy Hanukkah--BRIAN SOZZI: Thank you.JULIE HYMAN: --to everyone who celebrates.BRIAN SOZZI: You as well. I'm looking at MasterBrand. It looks like a brand that I may want to shop.

Good for them getting some play on the New York Stock Exchange.JULIE HYMAN: Good for them, indeed. All right, Brad is checking out what's going on the YFi Interactive over there Brad, you doing OK there as we get underway this morning?BRAD SMITH: I was just waiting for some things to calibrate so that we could put together a full view of what's going on for our viewers here. So taking a look at the Dow, out the gate, flat but barely to the upside here.Let's take a look at the year-to-date. How about that, because we're gonna be entering into some low volume periods as traders get some of the vacation. Of course, that could lead to some volatility, some volatile swings. Not here today. We're just kind of muddling along here. Flat to the downside now for the Dow Jones Industrial Average. So you've got the early makings of a waffle activity there.And then additionally here checking in on the NASDAQ Composite. Let's take a look at that major average for the tech-heavy average. You're seeing that flat just barely to the downside as well. S&amp;P 500, same case there. I sound like a broken record.Story continuesBut let's check in on some of the sectors. Perhaps we got some interesting activity playing out there. As of right now, you've got more laggards than advancers. Really, just energy. Energy, and now you've got some entrance into that party, the positive gains party, with materials flat barely to the upside.And financials deciding to get in on the chat, too. So and you're seeing communication services actually move lower by about 7/10 of percent. Bringing up the caboose here, we're gonna break down some deal activity that's taking place in that sector in just a hot second.And then lastly here, I did want to take a look at some of the travel names, as we've seen for TSA Travel throughput numbers, I noted down that we had seen 2.35 million people travel over this week-- or over this weekend-- yesterday, actually, to really kick off some of that holiday travel.And so keep a close eye on some of the airline names. You have also got a deal between the United airlines and Mesa Airlines for regional flights. That as they move away from their previous partner, which was American Airlines. And so American Airlines, you're seeing them actually fractionally higher right now by about 3/10 of a percent. While United Airlines is up by about 6/10 of a percent.So we'll keep a close eye on everything from the booking names all the way into the hotel, the travel and accommodation space. Going to be interesting to watch over the course of this week as we see even more of those throughput numbers given-- giving us some kind of real time-- real-time insight into how people are moving about the country this holiday season.JULIE HYMAN: Yeah, we always have our [INAUDIBLE] data as well.

However, as a result of recent losses, their initial investment is now only worth US$721k, which is not what they expected.While insider transactions are not the most important thing when it comes to long-term investing, we would consider it foolish to ignore insider transactions altogether. Check out our latest analysis for Sherwin-Williams The Last 12 Months Of Insider Transactions At Sherwin-WilliamsOver the last year, we can see that the biggest insider purchase was by Chairman &amp; CEO John Morikis for US$519k worth of shares, at about US$260 per share. So it's clear an insider wanted to buy, even at a higher price than the current share price (being US$240). While their view may have changed since the purchase was made, this does at least suggest they have had confidence in the company's future. We always take careful note of the price insiders pay when purchasing shares. It is generally more encouraging if they paid above the current price, as it suggests they saw value, even at higher levels.In the last twelve months insiders purchased 3.00k shares for US$773k. But they sold 1.54k shares for US$401k. Overall, Sherwin-Williams insiders were net buyers during the last year.

We usually like to see fairly high levels of insider ownership. It's great to see that Sherwin-Williams insiders own 0.3% of the company, worth about US$173m. I like to see this level of insider ownership, because it increases the chances that management are thinking about the best interests of shareholders.Story continuesWhat Might The Insider Transactions At Sherwin-Williams Tell Us?There haven't been any insider transactions in the last three months -- that doesn't mean much. On a brighter note, the transactions over the last year are encouraging. It would be great to see more insider buying, but overall it seems like Sherwin-Williams insiders are reasonably well aligned (owning significant chunk of the company's shares) and optimistic for the future.

The rate change request, which was filed in Feb. 2022, was driven primarily by over $1.1 billion in completed or planned investment, reflecting approximately $948 million in water system improvements and $204 million in wastewater system improvements in Illinois from 2018 through 2023.The rate order will result in a total annualized revenue increase of approximately $67 million. The additional revenues will support continued investment in critical water and wastewater infrastructure throughout the state, including the replacement, lining and installation of approximately 141 miles of aging water and wastewater pipelines. Investments would also include, among others, upgrading water and wastewater treatment plants, storage tanks, wells, pumping stations, fire hydrants, meters and manholes across the state.""By making prudent, ongoing investments to maintain and upgrade our water and wastewater systems, Illinois American Water is committed to the safety and reliability of our systems in the communities we serve,"" said Rebecca Losli, Illinois American Water president.The last change in Illinois American Water base rates for water and wastewater service occurred in 2017. The amount of the rate change customers will experience will vary among the company’s operating districts. The monthly water service bill for the typical residential customer using 3,500 gallons per month with a 5/8-inch meter will increase between $3 and $16 per month, depending on the service area. The typical residential wastewater bill will increase between $25 and $36 per month, depending on the service area. Customers will receive communication in their Illinois American Water bill further explaining the rate change.Story continuesIn addition to the rate adjustment, the ICC approved Illinois American Water’s request for a low-income discount tariff. A combined wastewater collection and treatment bill for the typical qualifying residential customer could decrease by about $13 to $26 a month, depending on the service area. A typical qualifying residential water service bill could decrease by about $12 to $24 a month, depending on the service area.""The low-income discount tariff reflects our commitment to affordability for our customers, in addition to the critical investments in our systems to maintain public health,"" said Losli.

Customers in Southern California, and throughout the state, are encouraged to continue using water responsibly and make water conservation an important part of their every day.California American Water customers in Southern California did a great job this year, reducing water use when compared to November of 2020. The company’s Ventura County and Los Angeles County customers used about 32 percent less and 22 percent less water in November than during the same period in 2020, respectively. And its San Diego County customers, who are among the lowest water users in the region, also reported savings in November.""I want to acknowledge the great work and thank our customers who responded and reduced their water use,"" said Director of Operations Jessica Taylor. ""I would also like to remind all our customers to continue to adopt good water habits, as MWD has signaled that imported water supplies are likely to be limited in 2023 which would potentially require water utilities and customers to reduce their water use.""While strides have been made to reduce water usage by more than 20 percent, California American Water wants to help customers achieve further water savings.

(FCX) is a Trending Stock,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/know-beyond-why-freeportmcmoran-inc-140002401.html,1671458402,STORY,['FCX'],"[Freeport-McMoRan (FCX) is one of the stocks most watched by Zacks.com visitors lately. So, it might be a good idea to review some of the factors that might affect the near-term performance of the stock.Shares of this mining company have returned +5.6% over the past month versus the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's -2.7% change. The Zacks Mining - Non Ferrous industry, to which Freeport-McMoRan belongs, has gained 1.8% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?Although media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.Earnings Estimate RevisionsRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.Our analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.For the current quarter, Freeport-McMoRan is expected to post earnings of $0.36 per share, indicating a change of -62.5% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -13.9% over the last 30 days.For the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $2.28 points to a change of -27.2% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has changed -2.4%.Story continuesFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $1.68 indicates a change of -26% from what Freeport-McMoRan is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -1.2%.With an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for Freeport-McMoRan.The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPS12-month consensus EPS estimate for FCX _12MonthEPSChartUrlProjected Revenue GrowthWhile earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.In the case of Freeport-McMoRan, the consensus sales estimate of $5.39 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of -12.6%. The $22.46 billion and $22.62 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of -1.7% and +0.7%, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryFreeport-McMoRan reported revenues of $5 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -17.8%. EPS of $0.26 for the same period compares with $0.89 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $5.2 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of -3.75%. The EPS surprise was -23.53%.Over the last four quarters, the company surpassed EPS estimates just once. The company topped consensus revenue estimates just once over this period.ValuationNo investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.While comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.The Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.Freeport-McMoRan is graded B on this front, indicating that it is trading at a discount to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.Bottom LineThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Freeport-McMoRan. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

385,4d5c8c0e-6bcc-35c7-8483-5ee7508e25e3,FCX,2022-12-20,10 Cheapest Stocks With Biggest Upside,Insider Monkey,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/10-cheapest-stocks-biggest-upside-131751594.html,1671455871,STORY,"['BEST', 'AMD', 'NMM', 'GLBS', 'ACRX', 'FCX', 'STG', 'NVDA']","[In this article, we discuss the 10 cheapest stocks with the biggest upside. If you want to read about some more cheapest stocks with the biggest upside, go directly to 5 Cheapest Stocks With Biggest Upside.According to the advance estimate released by the Bureau of Economic Analysis in late October 2022, the real gross domestic product (GDP) in the US increased at an annual rate of 2.6 percent in the third quarter of 2022. The increase in real GDP reflected increases in exports, consumer spending, nonresidential fixed investment, federal government spending, and state and local government spending, which were partly offset by decreases in residential fixed investment and private inventory investment. The stock market has been witnessing high volumes as the latest numbers from the Bureau of Economic Analysis indicate that the US economy grew an annualized 2.9% at the end of 2022, better than the initial estimate of 2.6%, and beating forecasts of 2.7%. The performance reflects the upward revisions to consumer and business spending and net trade. The biggest positive contribution came from net trade, as imports sank more while exports rose more. The nonresidential investment jumped at a faster 5.1% which is better than the expected 3.7%. Considering the expenditure side, personal consumption expenditures account for 68% of total GDP, out of which purchases of goods constitute 23% and services 45%. Moreover, private investment accounts for 16% of GDP and government consumption and investment for 18%. The figures paint a warmer picture for the US economy considering the slowdown witnessed in the first two quarters of the year, boosting stocks like NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD), and Freeport-McMoRan Inc. (NYSE:FCX). As far as the global economy is concerned, it is still adjusting to the pandemic shock and the subsequent policy response. In 2023, the US economy will continue to face a rather different set of risks, according to a recent Bloomberg report which shows that a recession is effectively certain in the next 12 months. Likewise, analysis published by Financial Times shows that economists are thinking about a recession likely to happen in the US, with the probability of such a recession being more than 60%.  Story continuesMoreover, tightening financial conditions, persistent inflation and expectations of a hawkish Federal Reserve are raising the risk of a contraction as well. These uncertainties are fanning the flames of inflation and nudging the Fed toward an even more aggressive policy path. However, there is hope that the cyclical sector of the US market still contains plausible soft-landing potential, a combination of an outcome where job openings are falling while the unemployment rate remains low. As the stock market recovers from a dismal 2022 and prepares for an uncertain 2023, investors eager for an entry point into the stock world should consider investing in some cheap stocks that have explosive growth potential. These options can provide investors with some balanced risk/reward profiles in a market where investments in value stocks are soaring and putting money into prominent growth stocks carries much higher levels of risk. Some of these options are discussed below. Investing in the US market is also advisable since it is the largest and the most accessible market in the world.  No other market is as liquid as the US stock market. The number of listed companies in the US far outnumber those in other parts of the world. The NASDAQ and the New York Stock Exchange also represent one of the single biggest concentrations of money in global history. This means that they have a large market capitalization and high transaction volumes, boosting chances of solid returns.Photo by Ruben Sukatendel on UnsplashOur MethodologyThe companies that have upcoming growth catalysts and were priced under $50 per share, as of December 18, were selected for the list.

If approved in Europe, Dupixent will become the first and only targeted medicine indicated for people aged 12 years and older with eosinophilic esophagitis in the country.Dupixent was approved by the FDA for the treatment of eosinophilic esophagitis in patients aged 12 years and above in May 2022. It is the only medicine currently approved for treating eosinophilic esophagitis in the United States.The latest CHMP opinion considers patients aged 12 years and above, weighing at least 40 kg, whose disease is inadequately controlled by, are intolerant to or who are not candidates for conventional therapy.The CHMP’s recommendation was based on data from a pivotal phase III study, which showed that treatment with Dupixent 300 mg weekly significantly improved patients’ ability to swallow and achieved histological disease remission compared to placebo.Shares of Sanofi have declined 6.2% so far this year against the industry’s rally of 11.1%.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchIn Europe, Dupixent is presently approved to treat atopic dermatitis, asthma and chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyposis (CRSwNP). Last week, the European Commission approved Dupixent for the treatment of adult patients with moderate-to-severe prurigo nodularis.If approved for eosinophilic esophagitis, it would be Dupixent’s fifth approved indication in Europe.Dupixent is already approved in the United States for five indications — severe CRSwNP, severe asthma, moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis, eosinophilic esophagitis and prurigo nodularis.Dupixent is being jointly marketed by REGN and SNY under a global collaboration agreement. Sanofi records global net product sales of Dupixent while Regeneron records its share of profits/losses in connection with the global sales of the drug.Story continuesDupixent’s frequent label expansion approvals are driving Sanofi’s sales. The drug generated sales worth €5.89 billion in the first nine months of 2022, reflecting an increase of 44.5% at CER year over year.In a separate press release, Sanofi announced that it has expanded the ongoing collaboration with France-based biotech, Innate Pharma SA IPHA for natural killer cell therapeutics in oncology.Per the latest deal, SNY will gain an exclusive license to IPHA’s B7H3 ANKET program and will have options for up to two additional targets.Sanofi and Innate signed their first NK cell engagers collaboration in 2016 for developing up to two bispecific NK cell engagers, which are currently being evaluated by Sanofi.

The company's shares saw a decent share price growth in the teens level on the NYSE over the last few months. As a large-cap stock with high coverage by analysts, you could assume any recent changes in the company’s outlook is already priced into the stock. However, what if the stock is still a bargain? Let’s examine Union Pacific’s valuation and outlook in more detail to determine if there’s still a bargain opportunity. Check out our latest analysis for Union Pacific What's The Opportunity In Union Pacific?According to my valuation model, Union Pacific seems to be fairly priced at around 19.32% above my intrinsic value, which means if you buy Union Pacific today, you’d be paying a relatively reasonable price for it. And if you believe that the stock is really worth $172.98, then there isn’t really any room for the share price grow beyond what it’s currently trading. Although, there may be an opportunity to buy in the future. This is because Union Pacific’s beta (a measure of share price volatility) is high, meaning its price movements will be exaggerated relative to the rest of the market. If the market is bearish, the company’s shares will likely fall by more than the rest of the market, providing a prime buying opportunity.What kind of growth will Union Pacific generate?earnings-and-revenue-growthInvestors looking for growth in their portfolio may want to consider the prospects of a company before buying its shares. Buying a great company with a robust outlook at a cheap price is always a good investment, so let’s also take a look at the company's future expectations. With profit expected to grow by a double-digit 15% over the next couple of years, the outlook is positive for Union Pacific. It looks like higher cash flow is on the cards for the stock, which should feed into a higher share valuation.What This Means For YouAre you a shareholder? It seems like the market has already priced in UNP’s positive outlook, with shares trading around its fair value. However, there are also other important factors which we haven’t considered today, such as the financial strength of the company. Have these factors changed since the last time you looked at the stock? Will you have enough conviction to buy should the price fluctuates below the true value?Story continuesAre you a potential investor? If you’ve been keeping tabs on UNP, now may not be the most advantageous time to buy, given it is trading around its fair value. However, the positive outlook is encouraging for the company, which means it’s worth diving deeper into other factors such as the strength of its balance sheet, in order to take advantage of the next price drop.With this in mind, we wouldn't consider investing in a stock unless we had a thorough understanding of the risks.

In a perfect world, we'd like to see a company investing more capital into its business and ideally the returns earned from that capital are also increasing. This shows us that it's a compounding machine, able to continually reinvest its earnings back into the business and generate higher returns. Speaking of which, we noticed some great changes in Cisco Systems' (NASDAQ:CSCO) returns on capital, so let's have a look.Understanding Return On Capital Employed (ROCE)Just to clarify if you're unsure, ROCE is a metric for evaluating how much pre-tax income (in percentage terms) a company earns on the capital invested in its business. To calculate this metric for Cisco Systems, this is the formula:Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)0.21 = US$14b ÷ (US$93b - US$25b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to October 2022).Thus, Cisco Systems has an ROCE of 21%.  That's a fantastic return and not only that, it outpaces the average of 8.7% earned by companies in a similar industry. View our latest analysis for Cisco Systems roceIn the above chart we have measured Cisco Systems' prior ROCE against its prior performance, but the future is arguably more important. If you're interested, you can view the analysts predictions in our free report on analyst forecasts for the company.What Can We Tell From Cisco Systems' ROCE Trend?Cisco Systems has not disappointed in regards to ROCE growth. We found that the returns on capital employed over the last five years have risen by 68%. The company is now earning US$0.2 per dollar of capital employed. In regards to capital employed, Cisco Systems appears to been achieving more with less, since the business is using 33% less capital to run its operation. A business that's shrinking its asset base like this isn't usually typical of a soon to be multi-bagger company.Story continuesThe Bottom Line On Cisco Systems' ROCEIn the end, Cisco Systems has proven it's capital allocation skills are good with those higher returns from less amount of capital. And with a respectable 43% awarded to those who held the stock over the last five years, you could argue that these developments are starting to get the attention they deserve. With that being said, we still think the promising fundamentals mean the company deserves some further due diligence.While Cisco Systems looks impressive, no company is worth an infinite price.
