Some of these companies have been around for nearly 100 years and are well-known household names. In their heyday, they led technological advances that transformed our lives and pushed society into the future. From personal computers and software applications to microchips and wireless internet. However, now that they are mature, established, and entrenched, many of these once-leading names have fallen out of favor with investors who are preoccupied with the new, shiny thing in tech. This is a shame as many legacy tech companies continue to be great businesses. It wouldn’t take much for their stocks to turn around and rise again. Here are seven legacy tech stocks primed for a comeback.ORCLOracle$96.55TXNTexas Instruments$161.18AMTAmerican Tower$195.63IBMIBM.$121.17TAT&amp;T$16.92HPQHP. Inc.$29.54INTCIntel$29.56Oracle (ORCL)Tech stocks: Double exposure of man's hands holding and using a phone and financial graph drawing.Source: Peshkova / ShutterstockLet’s begin with Oracle (NYSE:ORCL). Co-founded in 1977 by Larry Ellison, Oracle is a software company whose products help companies manage their human resources departments and supply chains, as well as other areas of their business. The company may have gotten a little long in the tooth, but it remains the third biggest software company in the world with annual revenues of more than $40 billion. Additionally, Oracle continues to issue strong earnings reports.Yet, the stock does not get as much love from investors as competing software concerns. So far in 2023, ORCL stock has gained 15%, which is half the 30% advance seen in shares of Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT). Long-term, Oracle’s stock performance appears better, with the share price doubling over the past five years. More recently, the stock has struggled a bit due to Wall Street’s negative views of its $28 billion acquisition of electronic medical records company Cerner. However, it may not be long before Oracle’s stock has a big breakout.Story continuesInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsTexas Instruments (TXN)A concept image of robot hands with stock information in between themSource: Blue Planet Studio / ShutterstockMany people still think about calculators when they hear the name Texas Instruments (NASDAQ:TXN). And for good reason. Calculators were the company’s bread-and-butter for much of its 93-year history. However, Texas Instruments today has gone well beyond the calculators it sells to middle and high school students. The company is now a major manufacturer of semiconductors and integrated circuits. In fact, Texas Instruments is one of the top 10 semiconductor concerns in the world.With more than 30,000 employees worldwide and annual revenues north of $20 billion, Texas Instruments is a formidable technology company. It also has more than 45,000 patents to its name and is a major holder of intellectual property rights. Yet TXN stock continues to drift sideways for the most part. In the last 12 months, the stock has declined 2%. While the stock has risen 50% in the past five years, it continues to trail other tech names.In addition, TXN stock offers a robust quarterly dividend that pays $1.24 a share for a yield of 3.05%. The shares look undervalued with a price-earnings ratio of 18. Most tech stocks the size of Texas Instruments trade at 25 times future earnings, or more, and offer no dividend payout.American Tower (AMT)Close up of phone with creative forex chart on blue background. Trade, finance, technology and communication concept. 3D Rendering. Tech Stocks to Buy Before the Bull Market ReturnsSource: Golden Dayz / Shutterstock.comAmerican Tower (NYSE:AMT) is technically a real estate investment trust. However, it is also a major technology company given that it owns the largest portfolio of wireless Internet towers in the U.S. American Tower is now adapting its infrastructure and towers to handle fifth-generation (5G) wireless as demand for the most powerful Internet skyrockets across the U.S. In business since 1995, American Tower today has more than 6,000 employees and revenues of nearly $10 billion.Despite the essential nature of its business, AMT stock has struggled. The share price is down 16% over the past year, including a 10% pullback so far in 2023. Through five years, the share price has gained a tepid 39%. As with Texas Instruments, American Tower pays a strong quarterly dividend that yields 3.22% or $1.56 per share. So what’s holding the stock back? Analysts claim it is the slow adoption of 5G wireless outside the U.S. That and higher debt servicing costs due to rising interest rates are expected to grow by $315 million in 2023.IBM (IBM)Photo of IBM (IBM) building as seen through the canopy of a tree. IBM logo is in large letters on side of building.Source: shutterstock.com/LCVBig Blue could be the poster child for legacy technology companies. In continuous operation since 1911, investors would be hard-pressed to find an older technology stock. Yet International Business Machines Corp. (NYSE:IBM) has undergone quite a bit of restructuring in recent years in an effort to improve its financial and stock performance. Changes have included the spin-off of its managed infrastructure business into Kyndryl (NYSE:KD), and the repositioning of the core IBM business as a cloud computing firm.IBM also continues to focus on the development of supercomputers through its quantum computing division which is focused on both commercial and scientific applications. Interest in the company’s quantum capabilities is growing with the rise of artificial intelligence. Yet all the changes have not been enough to move the needle on IBM stock. The company’s share price is down 10% over the past 12 months, bringing its five-year decline to 12%. A renewed focus on AI might be just the thing to finally push IBM stock higher.AT&amp;T (T)Graphic of side view of virtual financial charts with tech aesthetic, symbolizing fintechSource: shutterstock.com/whiteMoccaAT&amp;T (NYSE:T) is another technology company that is a household name in the U.S. but has struggled to gain traction with investors in recent years. The legacy company, which was founded in 1983, recently reported abysmal quarterly results that caused its share price to plunge 10%, marking the biggest one-day drop in T stock since the technology bubble burst back in 2000. Poor subscriber numbers hurt AT&amp;T’s earnings and led to a big selloff in the shares.However, T stock has been on the downslope for many years. In the past five years, the company’s share price has declined 30%. Alternating business strategies in recent years have sowed confusion among investors. The company first prioritized diversification, then shed its non-core assets, including WarnerMedia, to focus on growing its wireless internet service. But now, AT&amp;T says high inflation and rising interest rates have made consumers reluctant to spend money on 5G wireless. The good news is that T stock may have finally bottomed.HP Inc. (HPQ)Picture of Hewlett Packard Enterprise offices in Palo Alto, CA. HPE stock.Source: Sundry Photography / ShutterstockTechnology company HP Inc. (NYSE:HPQ) is a personal computer company that is best known for making printers. In business since 1939 and formerly known as “Hewlett-Packard,” the home where HP was founded in Palo Alto, California, has been labeled a historical landmark and marked with a plaque that reads: “Birthplace of Silicon Valley.” Now that’s a legacy tech company! Today, HP is still involved in its core business of computer hardware and printers, though it is increasingly focused on cutting-edge 3D printers.HP stock is another one that has lagged behind its peers in recent years. Over the last 12 months, HPQ stock has slumped 18%. Its five-year gain is only 33%. Yet HP is another old tech company that pays a very attractive dividend to its stockholders. Currently, the dividend yield on HPQ stock is 3.47%, which is high for any stock but exceptional among tech securities. Also, HP’s shares look significantly undervalued trading at a P/E ratio of only 12. Again, most tech companies the size of HP trade at more than double that rate.Intel (INTC)An Army soldier using a laptop representing BBAI Stock.Source: Gorodenkoff / Shutterstock.comIf any legacy technology stock is due for a rebound, it is microchip and semiconductor company Intel (NASDAQ:INTC). The company has been struggling mightily as it moves to transform its business to fabricating chips and semiconductors for other companies. Intel is spending more than $20 billion to reposition its chip factories as foundries. The effort is seriously impacting the company’s bottom line, resulting in Intel reporting the biggest loss in its 55-year history for this year’s first quarter.Specifically, Intel announced a 133% annual reduction in its Q1 earnings per share and reported that its revenue in Q1 fell 36% from a year earlier to $11.7 billion. This year’s first quarter marked the fifth consecutive quarter of falling sales at Intel. Owing to its big investments aimed at a turnaround, and the poor earnings, INTC stock has declined 45% in the last five years, including a 32% decrease in the past 12 months. However, once the transition to manufacturing microchips is complete, Intel could end up being a winner.On the date of publication, Joel Baglole held a long position in MSFT.

Combining their flash memory businesses could boost competitiveness against rivals like South Korea's Samsung Electronics.Under the plan now being worked out, the merged entity would be 43% owned by Kioxia, 37% by Western Digital and the rest by existing shareholders of the companies, one of the sources said.Both sources declined to be identified as the talks are private.No decision has been made and the details could change, the sources said. The planned merger is also likely to draw anti-trust scrutiny in several countries, including the United States and China.A Kioxia spokesperson declined to comment on speculation. Western Digital did not respond immediately to a request for comment.Activist investor Elliott Management, which owns convertible preferred shares in Western Digital, has been pushing the U.S. company to split off its flash-memory business from its hard-drive division since making an initial stock investment last year.Such a split would precede the flash memory combination with Kioxia, one of the sources said, adding that the merged company might pursue a listing after the deal.Kioxia, previously Toshiba Memory, was sold by Toshiba Corp in 2018 to a consortium led by Bain Capital for $18 billion. It has shelved plans for an initial public offering due to the deteriorating flash-memory market. Toshiba still owns 40.6% of Kioxia.Elliott is also a shareholder of Toshiba, and one of the investor's executives serves on the board of the Japanese company.Toshiba itself is also undergoing an overhaul. A group led by private equity firm Japan Industrial Partners (JIP) has launched a $15 billion buyout offer for Toshiba, although the company's board has stopped short of recommending the deal to shareholders, citing concerns the price was too low.Story continuesKioxia's falling valuation is one of the factors that dragged down JIP's offer price, according to a Toshiba filing.It was not immediately clear what Toshiba would do with its stake in Kioxia if the merger with Western Digital's flash memory business proceeded or how the deal would impact JIP's bid for Toshiba, the sources said.Kioxia and Western Digital were in merger talks in 2021 before the negotiations stalled over a series of issues including valuation discrepancies. Bloomberg reported the revival of the merger talks in January.In Japan, the two companies jointly produce NAND flash memory chips, which do not need power to retain data and are used in smartphones, personal computers and data centre servers.A combined Kioxia-Western Digital would control a third of the global NAND flash market, putting it on par with Samsung, the biggest player.Analysts say Kioxia and Western Digital have been more vulnerable to NAND flash market volatility than Samsung and SK Hynix Inc, which are also main players in the more consolidated DRAM chip market.(Reporting by Maki Shiraki and Makiko Yamazaki; Editing by David Dolan and Jamie Freed)]"

The busy week of retail earnings will also include results from Target and TJX (TJX) on Wednesday, with Walmart and Alibaba (BABA) reporting Thursday.Outside retail numbers and housing data headlined by existing home sales and homebuilder sentiment, the week will be relatively quiet on the economic data front.In Washington, D.C., debt ceiling deliberations between President Joe Biden and House Speaker Kevin McCarthy are expected to continue early in the week as the government approaches the so-called ""X-date"" when the government would run out of borrowing capacity.Elsewhere in Washington, former top executives at Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank are expected to testify before the Senate on Tuesday.The benchmark S&amp;P 500 (^GSPC) finished last week lower despite inflation rising at its slowest annual rate in 2 years. Weak consumer sentiment and ongoing banking concerns pushed stocks lower into the weekend.Year to date, the Nasdaq is up more than 17%, while the S&amp;P 500 has risen 7% and the Dow Jones Industrial Average is clinging to gains just below 0.5% on the year.Trade downs from higher income consumers, inventory levels, and current-quarter trends will be the focus for investors during retail earnings reports this week.

""This means our customers are looking to stretch their budgets further, and are focused on value.""Data from Bank of America last week also signaled a slowdown, with total retail excluding auto spending down 2.3% on yearly basis according to the firm's credit card data.""We expect a benefit from trade-down will occur this year as inflationary pressures persist, especially given rising unemployment among the higher-income cohort,"" Bank of America's data analytics team wrote in a note to clients on Friday.A Walmart sign is seen inside its department store in West Haven, Connecticut, U.S., February 17, 2021.

Through its operations, supplier and sector-wide partnerships, and green finance offerings, Xylem aims to advance water security by reducing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, building watershed stewardship and resilience to climate change, and advancing equitable access to Water, Sanitation and Hygiene (WASH).The results, captured in Xylem’s latest Sustainability Report, saw the company achieve its 2025 CO2e emissions reduction goal well ahead of schedule. The reduction was enabled by the deployment of high-efficiency technologies and digital solutions. Xylem also made notable progress in reducing its own emissions, with Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions down 21% year-on-year, while also continuing to make strides on water and waste footprint reductions across its operations.""The stakes have never been higher in our work to tackle the world’s water challenges,"" Patrick Decker, President and CEO of Xylem, said.

The overall state of the industry can’t be characterized as being strong. Yet, there are still companies performing well despite overall headwinds. Some semiconductor firms continue to post stellar results that best not only industry averages but also recent performance.That isn’t easy given that global semiconductor sales fell by 8.7% sequentially in the first quarter of 2023. Year-over-year declines were even more drastic with global Q1 revenues falling 21.3% compared to Q1 ‘22. So companies that continue to grow in this current climate deserve real attention for their strong operations and results. InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsKLACKLA Corp. $386.38ONON Semiconductor $79.87MCHPMicrochip Technology $74.17ASMLASML $657.14AMDAMD $97.02AVGOBroadcom$626.27NXPINXP Semiconductors $165.20KLA Corp. (KLAC)A hexagonal grid with different tech-related icons; Tech stocks illustrationSource: whiteMocca / ShutterstockKLA Corp. (NASDAQ:KLAC) is a chip stock that doesn’t garner tons of attention despite being a solid company. The firm provides technology and devices that use advanced inspection tools, measurement systems, and analytics for semiconductors. It isn’t a well-known fabless manufacturer grabbing constant headlines but remains important nonetheless.What’s important about KLA for the purposes of this discussion is the fact that the company performed exceptionally well overall. While industry-wide revenues fell globally KLA managed to grow. Its most recent earnings report shows the company has increased its revenues by 6.2% year-over-year to $2.433 billion. Those results were stellar relative to the overall landscape and KLA’s internal performance also. The $2.43 billion in sales were near the top of the guidance range of $2.20 to $2.50 billion. The process controls firm expects that next quarter’s revenues could range as high as $2.375 billion giving investors a reasonable expectation of continued strong performance. Story continuesON Semiconductor (ON) Close-up Presentation of a New Generation Microchip. Gloved Hand Holding Piece of Technological Wonder. Semiconductor stocks are in the news.Source: ShutterstockBy now, investors should understand well that ON Semiconductor (NASDAQ:ON) is a very respectable chip stock. It has made a strong name for itself over the past years and become synonymous with the emergence of the automotive chip market. That association put ON into the limelight earlier in the pandemic where it continues to shine. In fact, the automotive and industrial end markets contributed to 79% of ON Semi’s revenues in Q1. The company posted revenues that increased by a modest 1%, rising to $1.9597 billion. That said, the company bested expectations overall which is what matters to the markets. ON shares have responded in kind moving up in the days following the May 1 earnings announcement. ON Semiconductor expects Q2 revenues to be within $50 million of $2.025 billion so growth will remain muted for the next few months. Performance exceeding the industry and EV growth potential will continue to keep ON stock among highly relevant chip stocks moving forward. Microchip Technology (MCHP) Microchip (MCHP) logo at HQ in Silicon Valley. Microchip Technology Inc. manufactures microcontrollers, mixed-signal, analog and Flash-IP integrated circuitsSource: Michael Vi / Shutterstock.comMicrochip Technology (NADSAQ:MCHP) stock is clearly among chip companies currently posting stellar results: The company’s Q4 ended March 31 and saw revenues increase by 21.1% on a year-over-year basis. Sales grew by 2.9% over the last quarter. All of the data points to a clear conclusion that Microchip Technology is bucking the overall downtrend. March 31 ended Microchip Technology’s fiscal year which resulted in record revenues of $8.439 billion. Breaking records is the story of Microchip Technology in the fiscal year and most recent quarter. Operating income, net income, per-share earnings, and other metrics all reached record levels at the company. The company provides smart connected control solutions. In other words, it’s an Internet of Things (IoT) chip firm. IoT industry growth projections remain very strong through 2030 and beyond with annual growth rates exceeding 25%. All of this means that Microchip Technology is performing well and should reasonably be expected to continue to perform well in the mid term and beyond. ASML (ASML) Closeup of mobile phone screen with ASML logo on computer keyboardSource: Ralf Liebhold / ShutterstockASML (NASDAQ:ASML) remains a vitally important firm in the semiconductor industry and a stock worth investing in based on recent performance. The company manufactures ultra-expensive lithography machines costing upwards of $200 million a piece. The machines are said to be some of the most complex ever built and are utilized in the production of leading-edge chips at the 5 and 3-nanometer scale. ASML is currently the only firm capable of producing EUV machines. Current estimates are that China may be next to crack the technology but that might take 5 years. In short, ASML maintains a massive advantage over an incredibly important industry. Q1 results were strong with continued sales increase on a sequential basis. YoY increases were even more impressive but the market doesn’t seem to be judging ASML on its results from a year ago. System sales more than doubled on a YoY basis in Q1 reaching $5.34 billion. Overall revenues nearly doubled, reaching $6.746 billion.  The good news is that ASML stock still has massive upside for investors currently. AMD (AMD) Sign of AMD office in Markham, Ontario, Canada. Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. is an American multinational semiconductor company.Source: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock.comAMD (NASDAQ:AMD) didn’t actually post stellar results in the first quarter. Not relative to global growth metrics anyway. The 9% decline in sales at the company was right in line with the global sales decline for the first quarter. Nor were AMD’s per-share earnings particularly strong either, at -$0.09. In fact, they were far worse than the $0.56 EPS the company posted a year earlier. Losses at AMD were substantial and drastically different than those a year prior. But none of that seems to matter to the market as share prices only temporarily fell following the May 2 announcement. Two days later it was as of nothing had happened and prices had fully rebounded. The market believes in AMD perhaps based on its performance over the past 3 years as revenue per share has grown by 35.7% even including recent problems. Investors care more about continuing Cloud business potential and AI prospects than metrics. Broadcom (AVGO) broadcom (AVGO) logo outside office buildingSource: Sasima / Shutterstock.comBroadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO) won’t release earnings again until early June. So it’s not technically a chip stock that’s on fire after posting stellar results. In fact, Broadcom last released earnings back in early March. Results were strng with revenues increasing by 16%. Further, earnings grew impressively, increasing by $1.302 billion on a year-over-year basis. If that weren’t enough, free cash flows jumped up by $548 million. In short, there was a lot of data to support the notion that AVGO stock was one to purchase. All of that said, it’s more about future performance than the past in the stock market. AVGO is expected report an EPS of approximately $8.23 this quarter. A year prior EPS reached $8.39. Any surprise would surely help. But what will really help Broadcom’s share price is any positive news related to its planned acquisition of VMWare. If the company can persuade regulators that its planned takeover is pro-competitive expect AVGO shares to jump. NXP Semiconductors (NXPI)A sign on a brick well for NXP Semiconductor. NXPI stock.Source: Lukassek / Shutterstock.comNXP Semiconductors (NASDAQ:NXPI) performed better than anticipated upon releasing results on May 1. The $3.12 billion in first-quarter sales for the company were better than anticipated and above the high end of guidance. Overall, NXP Semiconductor’s sales declined, falling 0.5% in the quarter YoY. Yet the results were strong given context. First, those sales exceeded guidance. Second, they were far better than industry-wide sales averages. And perhaps most importantly, NXP showed real progress in its strongest lines of business. Automotive revenues accounted for $1.828 billion of the company’s $3.12 billion in first-quarter sales growing 17% YoY. Mobile and IoT sales declined drastically during the quarter, falling 26% and 35%, respectively. However, NXP still managed to do better than expected indicating it has the ability to leverage its strength in automotive. If the company can improve those other businesses, especially IoT, expect it to really appreciate in price moving forward. On the date of publication, Alex Sirois did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude settled at $71.11 a barrel, up $1.07, or 1.5%.Wildfires raged in Alberta, Canada, shutting in large amounts of crude supply, and prices rose on fears they could worsen, said Mizuho analyst Robert Yawger.At least 300,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day (boepd) production was shut in last week in Alberta. In 2016, wildfires knocked more than a million boepd of production offline there.Global crude supplies could also tighten in the second half as OPEC+ - the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and allies including Russia - plan additional output cuts.""The OPEC+ cuts are likely to have a greater impact as we move through the summer, as previous attempts to balance the markets were offset by seasonal weakness and the release of strategic reserves,"" said Third Bridge analyst Peter McNally.The U.S. could start repurchasing oil for the Strategic Petroleum Reserve after completing a congressionally mandated sale in June, Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm told lawmakers on Thursday.Fears of a slowdown in the global economy limited gains in oil prices.Last week, oil benchmarks fell for a fourth consecutive week, the longest streak of weekly declines since September 2022, over fears of a U.S. recession and risks of a historic default on government debt in early June.""If credit conditions ease over the coming months, allaying economic fears for the world's largest economy, oil prices could bounce back without assistance but it seems a little premature at this point,"" said OANDA analyst Craig Erlam.(Additional reporting by Noah Browning, Florence Tan and Mohi Narayan; Editing by Kirsten Donovan, Mark Potter, David Gregorio and Sharon Singleton)]"

If you want to see more stocks in this selection, go to Billionaire Ken Fisher's Top 5 Stock Picks.Ken Fisher, the founder and co-chief investment officer of Fisher Asset Management, is widely known for his contributions to various financial publications as an author. Fisher is known for his contrarian investment strategies and his outspoken personality, which has sometimes landed him in controversy. Fisher said earlier this year that investors can strategically position their portfolios to benefit from the start of a new bull market by investing in categories that suffered the most during the bear market. Fisher believes that the market entered a new bull phase in October 2022 and expects growth-oriented sectors like information technology, which struggled last year, to perform well in the early stages of this phase.Ken Fisher discussed the ""pessimism of disbelief"" in a recent video. According to Fisher, this pessimism occurs when investors reject positive news, assuming it will eventually turn negative. He sees this type of pessimism as a positive sign for stocks since it's common at the beginning of bull market cycles.Billionaire Ken Fisher's top 10 stock picksFisher’s 13F portfolio value increased from about $148 billion in Q4 2022 to $165 billion in Q1 2023. During the first quarter, the fund added 181 new investments to its portfolio, increased its holdings in 377 existing stocks, divested from 52 equities, and decreased its positions in 510 stocks. The top ten stock positions add up to 26.02 % of the portfolio. Some of the most popular companies included in Ken Fisher's Q1 portfolio include Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), and Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL).Our MethodologyFor this article we picked the top 10 stocks from Ken Fisher's hedge fund portfolio for the first quarter of 2023.Billionaire Ken Fisher's top stock picks10. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (NYSE:TSM)Fisher Asset Management’s Holdings: $2,346,771,000 Story continuesPercentage of Fisher Asset Management’s Portfolio: 1.42%Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (NYSE:TSM) is the world's largest chip manufacturer.In the first quarter, Ken Fisher increased his stake in Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (NYSE:TSM) by 4%, and his 1.42% stake in the company is now worth about $2.35 billion. The most prominent shareholder in Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (NYSE:TSM) is Rajiv Jain’s GQG Partners, with 9,197,003 shares.Like Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), and Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (NYSE:TSM) is one of the top stock picks of billionaire Ken Fisher.Wedgewood Partners commented on Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (NYSE:TSM) in its investor letter for the Q1 of 2023.“Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (NYSE:TSM) contributed to performance as revenues grew +27% (in USD) from the year ago quarter. Despite this strength, the Company’s customers have seen near-term weakness in demand due to Covid-19 normalization as well as the launch timing of new products. However, the Company is well-positioned to continue a long-term growth trajectory because its leading-edge capacity is being absorbed by high-performance computing applications, particularly at nontraditional integrated circuit (IC) design houses, such as Apple, Alphabet and Amazon, which have become IC-design powerhouses over the past decade. Importantly, the Company’s aggressive investment in leading-edge equipment, tight development with fabless IC designers, and embrace of open development libraries, should continue to foster a superior competitive position and attractive long-term growth.”9. The Home Depot, Inc. (NYSE:HD)Fisher Asset Management’s Holdings: $2,478,511,000 Percentage of Fisher Asset Management’s Portfolio: 1.5%The Home Depot, Inc. (NYSE:HD) is a leading home improvement retailer with over 2,300 stores and a strong omnichannel network.Fisher Asset Management started building its position in The Home Depot, Inc. (NYSE:HD) in the first quarter of 2012 and, in the first quarter of 2023, holds over 8.40 million shares in the company, valued at $2.49 billion. The company represents 1.5% of the hedge fund’s 13F portfolio.In its Q1 2023 investor letter, Madison Investments provided a comment regarding The Home Depot, Inc. (NYSE:HD):“The Home Depot, Inc. (NYSE:HD) provided an update on reducing the environmental impact of its stores. Since 2010, the company has reduced U.S. store electricity use by 50% by implementing LED lighting across all of its stores, buying electricity from large-scale commercial solar farms, and installing rooftop solar farms. The company is now applying its experience to other parts of its operations, including reducing electricity use in its supply chain and water use in store irrigation. Home Depot was also recognized by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency for being one of the nation’s largest green power users.”8. Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD)Fisher Asset Management’s Holdings: $2,579,321,000 Percentage of Fisher Asset Management’s Portfolio: 1.56%Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) is a semiconductor company that makes chips for various applications, including PCs, gaming, cloud services, and automotive.On May 3, Truist analyst William Stein increased Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD)'s price target to $84 from $79, but maintained a ‘Hold’ rating on the stock. Despite the company's revenue exceeding expectations due to the upside in Gaming and Embedded segments, the analyst is concerned about AMD's weaker Q2 guidance and increasing investments in AI.Fisher's hedge fund also strengthened its position in Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) by buying 431,867 additional shares in Q1.In its investor letter for Q1 2023, White Falcon Capital Management provided a comment regarding Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD).“Last quarter we added Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) to the portfolio at 18x earnings and quickly made it into a top 5 position. At that time, Mr. Market was worried about earnings revisions for semiconductor stocks. In Q1 2023, it has been one of our best performing positions with the stock up 50%! In just three months, the market realized that Artificial Intelligence (AI) and related technologies require a lot of semiconductors. Mr. Market really is manic depressive but this volatility can give the enterprising investor just enough of a window to pick stocks with attractive risk rewards.”7. NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) Fisher Asset Management’s Holdings: $2,798,969,000 Percentage of Fisher Asset Management’s Portfolio: 1.69%NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) provides graphics, compute, and networking solutions globally.Ken Fisher is also bullish on NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) as of the end of the first quarter of 2023. His fund increased its holding in NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) by 1% in the first quarter, ending the period with over 10.08 million shares of the company.GQG Partners, with 8,247,311 shares, is the biggest stakeholder in the company.Baron Funds made the following comment about NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) in its Q1 2023 investor letter:“NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) is a semiconductor mega-cap company and global leader in gaming cards and accelerated computing hardware and software. Shares of NVIDIA rose over 90% during the first quarter because of material developments in generative AI evidenced by the release of ChatGPT and other competitive models. On its fourth quarter fiscal 2023 earnings call on February 22, Colette Kress, NVIDIA’s CFO said, “AI adoption is at an inflection point.… The opportunity is significant and driving strong growth in data center that will accelerate through the year.” On the same call, Jensen Huang, NVIDIA’s CEO emphasized: “The accumulation of technology breakthroughs has brought AI to an inflection point. Generative AI’s versatility and capability has triggered a sense of urgency at enterprises around the world to develop and deploy AI strategies.… NVIDIA AI is essentially the operating system of AI systems today.… The activity around AI infrastructures…has just gone through the roof in the last 60 days. And so there’s no question that whatever our views [were] of this year as we enter[ed] this year has fairly dramatically changed as a result over the last 60, 90 days.” Indeed, our research indicates that shortages of NVIDIA GPUs3 are the biggest gating factor for AI adoption and that about 90% of AI-model training runs are performed on their GPUs. During its annual GTC conference4 in March, NVIDIA announced new products and services that expand its addressable market and together form a full AI computing platform. These included: (1) new AI training systems (where it is dominant) and inferencing systems (where the field is more wide open), such as specialized chips in the areas of large language models and recommender systems, simulation and graphics rendering, and video use cases; (2) new fully managed AI services in partnership with the major cloud service providers, called NVIDIA DGX Cloud and NVDIA Omniverse Cloud; (3) new domain-specific generative AI foundational models, branded NVIDIA AI Foundations, which NVIDIA customers can harness to build and train custom language models with their own proprietary data to develop differentiated offerings; and (4) industry-specific accelerator libraries, spanning such diverse verticals as genomics analysis and computational lithography. We continue to believe NVIDIA’s end-to-end AI platform and leading market share in gaming, data centers, and robotics (including automotive), along with the size of these markets, will enable the company to drive durable growth for years to come.”6. Salesforce, Inc. (NYSE:CRM)Fisher Asset Management’s Holdings: $2,801,441,000 Percentage of Fisher Asset Management’s Portfolio: 1.69%Salesforce, Inc. (NYSE:CRM) provides global Customer Relationship Management (CRM) technology.Based on the 13F holdings for the first quarter of 2023, Fisher Asset Management owns 14.02 million shares in Salesforce, Inc.

(NASDAQ:AMZN), Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), and Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), Salesforce, Inc. (NYSE:CRM) is one of the top stocks on the radar of billionaire Ken Fisher.In its investor letter for Q1 2023, Vulcan Value Partners shared a comment about Salesforce, Inc. (NYSE:CRM):“Salesforce, Inc. (NYSE:CRM) was a material contributor during the quarter. The company has taken numerous positive steps to increase profitability more quickly than expected. Salesforce also improved its corporate governance by recommending three new board members. The company is focused on improving margins, deemphasizing acquisitions, and has expanded its stock buyback plan from $10 billion to $20 billion. We believe Salesforce can pursue these opportunities while continuing to increase its competitive position.” Click to continue reading and see Billionaire Ken Fisher's Top 5 Stock Picks. Suggested articles:12 Best Information Technology Services Stocks to Buy16 Most Profitable Value Stocks Now12 Best Household and Personal Care Stocks To BuyDisclosure: None. Billionaire Ken Fisher's Top 10 Stock Picks is originally published on Insider Monkey.]"

If you want to see more stocks in this selection, go to Billionaire Ken Fisher's Top 5 Stock Picks.Ken Fisher, the founder and co-chief investment officer of Fisher Asset Management, is widely known for his contributions to various financial publications as an author. Fisher is known for his contrarian investment strategies and his outspoken personality, which has sometimes landed him in controversy. Fisher said earlier this year that investors can strategically position their portfolios to benefit from the start of a new bull market by investing in categories that suffered the most during the bear market. Fisher believes that the market entered a new bull phase in October 2022 and expects growth-oriented sectors like information technology, which struggled last year, to perform well in the early stages of this phase.Ken Fisher discussed the ""pessimism of disbelief"" in a recent video. According to Fisher, this pessimism occurs when investors reject positive news, assuming it will eventually turn negative. He sees this type of pessimism as a positive sign for stocks since it's common at the beginning of bull market cycles.Billionaire Ken Fisher's top 10 stock picksFisher’s 13F portfolio value increased from about $148 billion in Q4 2022 to $165 billion in Q1 2023. During the first quarter, the fund added 181 new investments to its portfolio, increased its holdings in 377 existing stocks, divested from 52 equities, and decreased its positions in 510 stocks. The top ten stock positions add up to 26.02 % of the portfolio. Some of the most popular companies included in Ken Fisher's Q1 portfolio include Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), and Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL).Our MethodologyFor this article we picked the top 10 stocks from Ken Fisher's hedge fund portfolio for the first quarter of 2023.Billionaire Ken Fisher's top stock picks10. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (NYSE:TSM)Fisher Asset Management’s Holdings: $2,346,771,000 Story continuesPercentage of Fisher Asset Management’s Portfolio: 1.42%Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (NYSE:TSM) is the world's largest chip manufacturer.In the first quarter, Ken Fisher increased his stake in Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (NYSE:TSM) by 4%, and his 1.42% stake in the company is now worth about $2.35 billion. The most prominent shareholder in Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (NYSE:TSM) is Rajiv Jain’s GQG Partners, with 9,197,003 shares.Like Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), and Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (NYSE:TSM) is one of the top stock picks of billionaire Ken Fisher.Wedgewood Partners commented on Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (NYSE:TSM) in its investor letter for the Q1 of 2023.“Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (NYSE:TSM) contributed to performance as revenues grew +27% (in USD) from the year ago quarter. Despite this strength, the Company’s customers have seen near-term weakness in demand due to Covid-19 normalization as well as the launch timing of new products. However, the Company is well-positioned to continue a long-term growth trajectory because its leading-edge capacity is being absorbed by high-performance computing applications, particularly at nontraditional integrated circuit (IC) design houses, such as Apple, Alphabet and Amazon, which have become IC-design powerhouses over the past decade. Importantly, the Company’s aggressive investment in leading-edge equipment, tight development with fabless IC designers, and embrace of open development libraries, should continue to foster a superior competitive position and attractive long-term growth.”9. The Home Depot, Inc. (NYSE:HD)Fisher Asset Management’s Holdings: $2,478,511,000 Percentage of Fisher Asset Management’s Portfolio: 1.5%The Home Depot, Inc. (NYSE:HD) is a leading home improvement retailer with over 2,300 stores and a strong omnichannel network.Fisher Asset Management started building its position in The Home Depot, Inc. (NYSE:HD) in the first quarter of 2012 and, in the first quarter of 2023, holds over 8.40 million shares in the company, valued at $2.49 billion. The company represents 1.5% of the hedge fund’s 13F portfolio.In its Q1 2023 investor letter, Madison Investments provided a comment regarding The Home Depot, Inc. (NYSE:HD):“The Home Depot, Inc. (NYSE:HD) provided an update on reducing the environmental impact of its stores. Since 2010, the company has reduced U.S. store electricity use by 50% by implementing LED lighting across all of its stores, buying electricity from large-scale commercial solar farms, and installing rooftop solar farms. The company is now applying its experience to other parts of its operations, including reducing electricity use in its supply chain and water use in store irrigation. Home Depot was also recognized by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency for being one of the nation’s largest green power users.”8. Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD)Fisher Asset Management’s Holdings: $2,579,321,000 Percentage of Fisher Asset Management’s Portfolio: 1.56%Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) is a semiconductor company that makes chips for various applications, including PCs, gaming, cloud services, and automotive.On May 3, Truist analyst William Stein increased Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD)'s price target to $84 from $79, but maintained a ‘Hold’ rating on the stock. Despite the company's revenue exceeding expectations due to the upside in Gaming and Embedded segments, the analyst is concerned about AMD's weaker Q2 guidance and increasing investments in AI.Fisher's hedge fund also strengthened its position in Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) by buying 431,867 additional shares in Q1.In its investor letter for Q1 2023, White Falcon Capital Management provided a comment regarding Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD).“Last quarter we added Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) to the portfolio at 18x earnings and quickly made it into a top 5 position. At that time, Mr. Market was worried about earnings revisions for semiconductor stocks. In Q1 2023, it has been one of our best performing positions with the stock up 50%! In just three months, the market realized that Artificial Intelligence (AI) and related technologies require a lot of semiconductors. Mr. Market really is manic depressive but this volatility can give the enterprising investor just enough of a window to pick stocks with attractive risk rewards.”7. NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) Fisher Asset Management’s Holdings: $2,798,969,000 Percentage of Fisher Asset Management’s Portfolio: 1.69%NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) provides graphics, compute, and networking solutions globally.Ken Fisher is also bullish on NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) as of the end of the first quarter of 2023. His fund increased its holding in NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) by 1% in the first quarter, ending the period with over 10.08 million shares of the company.GQG Partners, with 8,247,311 shares, is the biggest stakeholder in the company.Baron Funds made the following comment about NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) in its Q1 2023 investor letter:“NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) is a semiconductor mega-cap company and global leader in gaming cards and accelerated computing hardware and software. Shares of NVIDIA rose over 90% during the first quarter because of material developments in generative AI evidenced by the release of ChatGPT and other competitive models. On its fourth quarter fiscal 2023 earnings call on February 22, Colette Kress, NVIDIA’s CFO said, “AI adoption is at an inflection point.… The opportunity is significant and driving strong growth in data center that will accelerate through the year.” On the same call, Jensen Huang, NVIDIA’s CEO emphasized: “The accumulation of technology breakthroughs has brought AI to an inflection point. Generative AI’s versatility and capability has triggered a sense of urgency at enterprises around the world to develop and deploy AI strategies.… NVIDIA AI is essentially the operating system of AI systems today.… The activity around AI infrastructures…has just gone through the roof in the last 60 days. And so there’s no question that whatever our views [were] of this year as we enter[ed] this year has fairly dramatically changed as a result over the last 60, 90 days.” Indeed, our research indicates that shortages of NVIDIA GPUs3 are the biggest gating factor for AI adoption and that about 90% of AI-model training runs are performed on their GPUs. During its annual GTC conference4 in March, NVIDIA announced new products and services that expand its addressable market and together form a full AI computing platform. These included: (1) new AI training systems (where it is dominant) and inferencing systems (where the field is more wide open), such as specialized chips in the areas of large language models and recommender systems, simulation and graphics rendering, and video use cases; (2) new fully managed AI services in partnership with the major cloud service providers, called NVIDIA DGX Cloud and NVDIA Omniverse Cloud; (3) new domain-specific generative AI foundational models, branded NVIDIA AI Foundations, which NVIDIA customers can harness to build and train custom language models with their own proprietary data to develop differentiated offerings; and (4) industry-specific accelerator libraries, spanning such diverse verticals as genomics analysis and computational lithography. We continue to believe NVIDIA’s end-to-end AI platform and leading market share in gaming, data centers, and robotics (including automotive), along with the size of these markets, will enable the company to drive durable growth for years to come.”6. Salesforce, Inc. (NYSE:CRM)Fisher Asset Management’s Holdings: $2,801,441,000 Percentage of Fisher Asset Management’s Portfolio: 1.69%Salesforce, Inc. (NYSE:CRM) provides global Customer Relationship Management (CRM) technology.Based on the 13F holdings for the first quarter of 2023, Fisher Asset Management owns 14.02 million shares in Salesforce, Inc.

(NYSE:CRM):“Salesforce, Inc. (NYSE:CRM) was a material contributor during the quarter. The company has taken numerous positive steps to increase profitability more quickly than expected. Salesforce also improved its corporate governance by recommending three new board members. The company is focused on improving margins, deemphasizing acquisitions, and has expanded its stock buyback plan from $10 billion to $20 billion. We believe Salesforce can pursue these opportunities while continuing to increase its competitive position.” Click to continue reading and see Billionaire Ken Fisher's Top 5 Stock Picks. Suggested articles:12 Best Information Technology Services Stocks to Buy16 Most Profitable Value Stocks Now12 Best Household and Personal Care Stocks To BuyDisclosure: None. Billionaire Ken Fisher's Top 10 Stock Picks is originally published on Insider Monkey.]"

29,b706ac39-8bdc-3737-a67a-c246841dda5c,SYY,2023-05-15,Investing in Sysco (NYSE:SYY) three years ago would have delivered you a 53% gain,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/investing-sysco-nyse-syy-three-120027955.html,1684152027,STORY,['SYY'],"[Vanguard founder Jack Bogle helped spearhead the low-cost index fund, putting average returns within reach of every investor. But if you pick the right individual stocks, you could make more than that. Notably, the Sysco Corporation (NYSE:SYY) share price has gained 42% in three years, which is better than the average market return. In contrast, the stock is actually down 12% in the last year, suggesting a lack of positive momentum.Let's take a look at the underlying fundamentals over the longer term, and see if they've been consistent with shareholders returns. View our latest analysis for Sysco To quote Buffett, 'Ships will sail around the world but the Flat Earth Society will flourish. There will continue to be wide discrepancies between price and value in the marketplace...' One imperfect but simple way to consider how the market perception of a company has shifted is to compare the change in the earnings per share (EPS) with the share price movement.Sysco was able to grow its EPS at 4.5% per year over three years, sending the share price higher. In comparison, the 12% per year gain in the share price outpaces the EPS growth. This suggests that, as the business progressed over the last few years, it gained the confidence of market participants. It's not unusual to see the market 're-rate' a stock, after a few years of growth.The graphic below depicts how EPS has changed over time (unveil the exact values by clicking on the image).earnings-per-share-growthWe know that Sysco has improved its bottom line lately, but is it going to grow revenue? If you're interested, you could check this free report showing consensus revenue forecasts.What About Dividends?As well as measuring the share price return, investors should also consider the total shareholder return (TSR). The TSR is a return calculation that accounts for the value of cash dividends (assuming that any dividend received was reinvested) and the calculated value of any discounted capital raisings and spin-offs. It's fair to say that the TSR gives a more complete picture for stocks that pay a dividend. As it happens, Sysco's TSR for the last 3 years was 53%, which exceeds the share price return mentioned earlier. The dividends paid by the company have thusly boosted the total shareholder return.Story continuesA Different PerspectiveInvestors in Sysco had a tough year, with a total loss of 9.5% (including dividends), against a market gain of about 2.6%. However, keep in mind that even the best stocks will sometimes underperform the market over a twelve month period. Longer term investors wouldn't be so upset, since they would have made 6%, each year, over five years. It could be that the recent sell-off is an opportunity, so it may be worth checking the fundamental data for signs of a long term growth trend. While it is well worth considering the different impacts that market conditions can have on the share price, there are other factors that are even more important. Consider risks, for instance. Every company has them, and we've spotted   1 warning sign for Sysco   you should know about.We will like Sysco better if we see some big insider buys.

30,cfef03ec-b70a-3d0d-ac68-e5e866b10e17,TDG,2023-05-15,"At US$796, Is It Time To Put TransDigm Group Incorporated (NYSE:TDG) On Your Watch List?",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/us-796-time-put-transdigm-110043375.html,1684148443,STORY,['TDG'],"[Today we're going to take a look at the well-established TransDigm Group Incorporated (NYSE:TDG). The company's stock saw a double-digit share price rise of over 10% in the past couple of months on the NYSE. With many analysts covering the large-cap stock, we may expect any price-sensitive announcements have already been factored into the stock’s share price. However, what if the stock is still a bargain? Let’s take a look at TransDigm Group’s outlook and value based on the most recent financial data to see if the opportunity still exists. See our latest analysis for TransDigm Group Is TransDigm Group Still Cheap?TransDigm Group is currently expensive based on my price multiple model, where I look at the company's price-to-earnings ratio in comparison to the industry average. In this instance, I’ve used the price-to-earnings (PE) ratio given that there is not enough information to reliably forecast the stock’s cash flows. I find that TransDigm Group’s ratio of 45.62x is above its peer average of 24.28x, which suggests the stock is trading at a higher price compared to the Aerospace &amp; Defense industry. But, is there another opportunity to buy low in the future? Given that TransDigm Group’s share is fairly volatile (i.e. its price movements are magnified relative to the rest of the market) this could mean the price can sink lower, giving us another chance to buy in the future. This is based on its high beta, which is a good indicator for share price volatility.What kind of growth will TransDigm Group generate?earnings-and-revenue-growthFuture outlook is an important aspect when you’re looking at buying a stock, especially if you are an investor looking for growth in your portfolio. Buying a great company with a robust outlook at a cheap price is always a good investment, so let’s also take a look at the company's future expectations. With profit expected to grow by 84% over the next couple of years, the future seems bright for TransDigm Group. It looks like higher cash flow is on the cards for the stock, which should feed into a higher share valuation.Story continuesWhat This Means For YouAre you a shareholder? TDG’s optimistic future growth appears to have been factored into the current share price, with shares trading above industry price multiples. However, this brings up another question – is now the right time to sell? If you believe TDG should trade below its current price, selling high and buying it back up again when its price falls towards the industry PE ratio can be profitable. But before you make this decision, take a look at whether its fundamentals have changed.Are you a potential investor? If you’ve been keeping tabs on TDG for some time, now may not be the best time to enter into the stock. The price has surpassed its industry peers, which means it is likely that there is no more upside from mispricing. However, the positive outlook is encouraging for TDG, which means it’s worth diving deeper into other factors in order to take advantage of the next price drop.So if you'd like to dive deeper into this stock, it's crucial to consider any risks it's facing. Be aware that TransDigm Group is showing 3 warning signs in our investment analysis and 2 of those are a bit unpleasant...If you are no longer interested in TransDigm Group, you can use our free platform to see our list of over 50 other stocks with a high growth potential.Have feedback on this article?

""Is it building a fantastic product, a fantastic service, or is it about trying to reshape the world? When companies decide that social and political issues are their most important thing, that's when they get into trouble.""Atkins floated Netflix (NFLX) as an example.""They had such a unified view and were on one side of the political spectrum that their creative teams created content for only one side,"" Atkins said. ""Finally, they realized they were losing half the market. So they had to go back and say, at Netflix, we're going to create content for all.""This Jan. 29, 2010, file photo shows the company logo and view of Netflix headquarters in Los Gatos, Calif. (AP Photo/Marcio Jose Sanchez, File) (ASSOCIATED PRESS)On the other hand, Atkins – who has served on more than two dozen corporate boards in her career – expressed concern about software provider Salesforce (CRM) and how its activism has left it vulnerable.""The problem where you get too focused on social issues... is that you unfortunately divide your employees because, by their nature, politics is divisive,"" Atkins added. ""It's not inclusive, it's not unifying, and you want every mental calorie to be dedicated to the company's business. You want an open environment where all views are welcome and you don't demonize your colleagues. You want the broadest set of views, but also the most diverse and inclusive.""She stressed that political stands can affect the bottom line, so they should be done thoughtfully.""I think we make sure we get all the best ideas that we create a great environment for,"" Atkins said. ""Everybody has a voice, but ... our business is our business.""Story continuesSo, what should companies do? How should they approach speaking out on political issues, when they do?""The best way to do it is to create a policy and, with that policy, say when you speak as a company, why you speak,"" Atkins said.""I would actually put the principles out there to your employee base and through your leadership team,"" she continued. ""We're going to create a policy on what are our beliefs, what are our values, and when we opine, when we engage, why do we engage? Is it relevant for us as a company?

Because synergy estimates reflect differences between certain actual costs incurred and management estimates of costs that would have been incurred in the absence of the integration of Newmont’s and Newcrest’s businesses, such estimates are necessarily imprecise and are based on numerous judgments and assumptions. Synergies are ""forward-looking statements"" subject to risks, uncertainties and other factors which could cause actual value creation to differ from expected or past synergies.B.Portfolio Optimization. Portfolio optimization as used in this press release is a management estimate provided for illustrative purposes and should not be considered a GAAP or non-GAAP financial measure. Because the enhancement to cash flow estimates the differences between certain actual cash flows and management estimates of cash flows in the absence of the integration of Newmont’s and Newcrest’s businesses, such estimates are necessarily imprecise and are based on numerous judgments and assumptions. Portfolio optimization to enhance cash flows is a ""forward-looking statement"" subject to risks, uncertainties and other factors which could cause enhanced cash flows to differ from expectations.C.Past Performance. Past performance metrics and figures included in this presentation are given for illustrative purposes only and should not be relied upon as (and are not) an indication of Newmont’s views on its or Newcrest’s future production, financial performance or condition or prospects (including on a consolidated basis). Investors should note that past performance of Newmont, including in relation to the past value returned to stockholders and past value creation and annual synergies, and other historical financial information cannot be relied upon as an indicator of (and provide no guidance, assurance or guarantee as to) future production or performance.D.Full Potential. Full Potential improvement value creation is considered an operating measure provided for illustrative purposes, and should not be considered GAAP or non-GAAP financial measures. Full Potential amounts are estimates utilized by management that represent estimated cumulative incremental value realized as a result of Full Potential projects implemented and are based upon both cost savings and efficiencies that have been monetized for purposes of the estimation. Because Full Potential improvement estimates reflect differences between certain actual costs incurred and management estimates of costs that would have been incurred in the absence of the Full Potential program, such estimates are necessarily imprecise and are based on numerous judgments and assumptions. Expectations of the results of Full Potential savings, synergies or improvements are forward-looking statements and subject to risks and uncertainties.E.Dividend. Our future dividends have not yet been approved or declared by the Board of Directors. An annualized dividend payout level has not been declared by the Board and is non-binding. The Company’s dividend framework and expected 2023 dividend payout ranges are non-binding. Management’s expectations with respect to future dividends, annualized dividends, payout ranges or dividend yield are ""forward-looking statements."" The declaration and payment of future dividends remain at the discretion of the Board of Directors and will be determined based on Newmont’s financial results, balance sheet strength, cash and liquidity requirements, future prospects, gold and commodity prices, and other factors deemed relevant by the Board. The duration, scope and impact of COVID-19 presents additional uncertainties with respect to future dividends and no assurance is being provided that the Company will pay future dividends at the increased payment level. The Board of Directors reserves all powers related to the declaration and payment of dividends. Consequently, in determining the dividend to be declared and paid on the common stock of the Company, the Board of Directors may revise or terminate the payment level at any time without prior notice.F.Cautionary Statement Regarding the Newcrest Historical Reserves Estimates: The mineral resource and mineral reserve estimates stated herein with respect to Newcrest (the ""Newcrest Historical Reserves Estimates"") were prepared to meet the reporting requirements of the Australian Securities Exchange (""ASX"") Listing Rules Chapter 5, December 2019; the Australasian Code for Reporting of Exploration Results, Mineral Resources and Ore Reserves, December 2012 (""JORC Code""), and were prepared in accordance with National Instrument 43-101 – Standards of Disclosure for Mineral Projects (""NI 43-101"") of the Canadian Securities Administrators, June 2011, Canadian Institute of Mining, Metallurgy and Petroleum Definition Standards on Mineral Resources and Mineral Reserves, May 2014 and the rules of the Toronto Stock Exchange (""TSX""). Investors should note that the requirements of the JORC Code and NI 43-101 differ from the requirements of Subpart 1300 of Regulation S-K. Reserves and resources prepared under the JORC Code and NI-43-101 are normally not permitted to be used in reports and registration statements filed with the SEC. Certain of the Newcrest Historical Reserves Estimates include inferred resources, which would not be permitted under Subpart 1300 of Regulation S-K. Inferred resources involve a great amount of uncertainty as to their existence and their economic and legal feasibility. A significant amount of exploration must be completed in order to determine whether an inferred resource may be upgraded to a higher category. US investors are cautioned not to assume that all or any part of an inferred resource exists or is economically or legally mineable. Accordingly, there is no assurance that the Newcrest Historical Reserves Estimates or any other mineral reserves or mineral resources that Newcrest may report under JORC or NI 43-101 will be the same as the mineral reserve or mineral resource estimates prepared under Subpart 1300 of Regulation S-K. The Newcrest Historical Reserves Estimates are subject to review and adjustment following closing of the pending Transaction, in accordance with Subpart 1300 of Regulation S-K adopted by the SEC, including to meet required study levels, price assumptions, for future divestments and acquisitions and other factors. No assurances can be made that all historical Newcrest mineral reserves or mineral resources will be recognized as Newmont mineral reserves or mineral resources. Under Subpart 1300 of Regulation S-K, a registrant’s disclosure of exploration results, mineral resources or mineral reserves must be based on and accurately reflect information and supporting documentation prepared by a qualified person. Newmont has not been involved in the preparation of Newcrest’s historical mining reserve or mining resource estimates. Accordingly, Newmont assumes no responsibility for such estimates. Expectations regarding future reserves and resource declarations should be considered ""forward-looking statements"" within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, which are intended to be covered by the safe harbor created by such sections and other applicable laws.G.Tier 1 Asset.

46,a82417e9-eec0-33b8-a3f3-a67433b7c7ea,GD,2023-05-15,General Dynamics' (NYSE:GD) investors will be pleased with their favorable 73% return over the last three years,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/general-dynamics-nyse-gd-investors-130025940.html,1684069225,STORY,['GD'],"[By buying an index fund, you can roughly match the market return with ease. But if you buy good businesses at attractive prices, your portfolio returns could exceed the average market return. For example, the General Dynamics Corporation (NYSE:GD) share price is up 60% in the last three years, clearly besting the market return of around 40% (not including dividends).Now it's worth having a look at the company's fundamentals too, because that will help us determine if the long term shareholder return has matched the performance of the underlying business. See our latest analysis for General Dynamics To quote Buffett, 'Ships will sail around the world but the Flat Earth Society will flourish. There will continue to be wide discrepancies between price and value in the marketplace...' One flawed but reasonable way to assess how sentiment around a company has changed is to compare the earnings per share (EPS) with the share price.General Dynamics was able to grow its EPS at 1.2% per year over three years, sending the share price higher. In comparison, the 17% per year gain in the share price outpaces the EPS growth. So it's fair to assume the market has a higher opinion of the business than it did three years ago. That's not necessarily surprising considering the three-year track record of earnings growth.The image below shows how EPS has tracked over time (if you click on the image you can see greater detail).earnings-per-share-growthIt's probably worth noting we've seen significant insider buying in the last quarter, which we consider a positive. On the other hand, we think the revenue and earnings trends are much more meaningful measures of the business. It might be well worthwhile taking a look at our free report on General Dynamics' earnings, revenue and cash flow.What About Dividends?It is important to consider the total shareholder return, as well as the share price return, for any given stock. Whereas the share price return only reflects the change in the share price, the TSR includes the value of dividends (assuming they were reinvested) and the benefit of any discounted capital raising or spin-off. Arguably, the TSR gives a more comprehensive picture of the return generated by a stock. As it happens, General Dynamics' TSR for the last 3 years was 73%, which exceeds the share price return mentioned earlier. This is largely a result of its dividend payments!Story continuesA Different PerspectiveInvestors in General Dynamics had a tough year, with a total loss of 5.1% (including dividends), against a market gain of about 2.6%. However, keep in mind that even the best stocks will sometimes underperform the market over a twelve month period. On the bright side, long term shareholders have made money, with a gain of 3% per year over half a decade. It could be that the recent sell-off is an opportunity, so it may be worth checking the fundamental data for signs of a long term growth trend. While it is well worth considering the different impacts that market conditions can have on the share price, there are other factors that are even more important. For example, we've discovered 1 warning sign for General Dynamics that you should be aware of before investing here.There are plenty of other companies that have insiders buying up shares. You probably do not want to miss this free list of growing companies that insiders are buying.Please note, the market returns quoted in this article reflect the market weighted average returns of stocks that currently trade on American exchanges.Have feedback on this article?

Worryingly, the AP reported recently that the banking crisis isn’t over yet. It’s just a matter of how much pain we may incur.If that’s the case, you don’t want to mess around with too many risk-on assets. Instead, you should consider recession-proof stocks to buy now. Thanks to their resilient profile or their business models’ emerging relevancies during rising troubles, these stout enterprises may fare better (perhaps even much better) than others. In addition, as circumstances become more ambiguous, investors may assign a premium toward wealth protection over outright wealth accumulation. Therefore, market participants may want to target the below safe haven stocks in volatile market.DLTRDollar Tree$155.17KOCoca-Cola$63.39CLColgate-Palmolive$80.64TJXTJX Companies$78.59NEENextEra Energy$75.58KELYAKelly Services$16.25MCYMercury General$29.87InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsDollar Tree (DLTR)man's hand holding wads of cash. stocks to buySource: Vova Shevchuk / Shutterstock.comWe’re just going to get right into it with the technical performance of Dollar Tree (NASDAQ:DLTR). On a year-to-date basis through May 5, DLTR gained nearly 11% of equity value. During the same period, the benchmark S&amp;P 500 index gained a bit over 8%. That’s a conspicuous gap over the broad index, implying greater demand for discount retailers. Of course, that’s a mixed bag for the economy.Nevertheless, for investors, DLTR easily ranks within the best safe stocks for market crash list. Financially, Dollar Tree doesn’t offer the sturdiest books, I must say. However, it gets the job done. For example, its Altman Z-Score comes in at 3.6, which slightly rides into the safe zone.Operationally, Dollar Tree features a three-year revenue growth rate of 8.5%, above 69.47% of defensive retail players. Also, its trailing-year net margin impresses at a lofty 5.7%. Finally, Wall Street analysts peg DLTR as a consensus moderate buy. Their average price target is a modest $158.83, implying over 2% upside potential. Still, for recession-proof stocks to buy now, it’s difficult to ignore.Story continuesCoca-Cola (KO)An image of a street sign post with directions labeled ""Buy"", ""Hold"", and ""Sell""Source: PX Media / ShutterstockFor much of this year, shares of Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO) fell into negative territory. However, in the past month, KO gained over 2% of equity value. Fundamentally, Coca-Cola should move higher as the trade-down effect takes hold. Basically, consumers may start trading down their caffeine addiction from pricey coffeeshops to soda cans at the grocery store.Financially, KO doesn’t make for the most remarkable name within the best safe stocks for market crash list. However, it does enjoy high fiscal stability and low risk of bankruptcy, as evidenced by its Altman Z-Score of 4.33. Operationally, though, its three-year revenue growth rate of 4.6% is just above average for the non-alcoholic beverages industry.However, Coca-Cola’s strength centers on consistent profitability. Presently, its trailing-year net margin stands at 22.69%, above 95.33% of its rivals. Thus, it’s a strong idea for the safe haven stocks in volatile market list. Lastly, analysts peg KO as a consensus strong buy. Their average price target hits $69.44, implying over 8% upside potential.Colgate-Palmolive (CL)Man holding stacks of money. millionaire stocks.Source: Epic Cure / ShutterstockAs with Coca-Cola above, Colgate-Palmolive (NYSE:CL) fell into negative territory in the charts for much of this year. But in the trailing one-month period, CL gained over 7% of market value. Therefore, since the beginning of this year, CL poked its head above parity by nearly 2%. Fundamentally, investors should have confidence that this recovery will continue. Basically, no matter how bad the economy gets, everyone needs to brush their teeth.Just from the perspective of common sense, CL should make the best safe stocks for market crash list. That said, the financials present somewhat of a mixed bag. Regarding stability, Colgate brings it in spades, according to the Altman Z-Score of 6.38. Operationally, though, the company’s three-year revenue growth rate is only 50.23%, just a bit above average for the consumer packaged goods industry.Nevertheless, CL intrigues because the underlying enterprise commands consistent profitability. Also, its trailing-year net margin is 8.71%, above 76.25% of its peers. To close out, analysts peg CL a consensus moderate buy. Their average price target lands at $87.46, implying almost 9% upside potential.TJX Companies (TJX)A person draws a stock chart on a chalkboard.Source: Zurijeta / Shutterstock.comOn paper, TJX Companies (NYSE:TJX) doesn’t seem particularly encouraging because its shares slipped roughly 1% YTD. However, TJX attempts to rank within the best safe stocks for market crash list with its recent performance. Since March 13, TJX shot up nearly 7%. Fundamentally, as companies start normalizing their workplace environment (i.e. recalling workers), people will look to upgrade their wardrobe for cheap.Naturally, TJX off-price department store business should be relevant for this endeavor. Thus, it ranks within the safe haven stocks in volatile market list. Financially, the company offers a decent canvas. First, TJX’s Altman Z-Score hits a credible 5.16, indicating stability and low bankruptcy risk. Operationally, its three-year revenue growth rate pings at 7.6%, above 65.36% of the competition.On the bottom line, TJX enjoys consistent profitability (10 consecutive years of net income). Also, its net margin is 7%, above 76.26% of sector players. Turning to Wall Street, analysts peg TJX a unanimous strong buy. On average, their price target stands at $90.73, implying almost 16% upside potential. Thus, it’s one of the low-risk high-reward stocks to consider.NextEra Energy (NEE)hands at desk near laptop computer, with one hand holding a pile of hundred dollar bills. Bank stocksSource: shutterstock.com/CC7Admittedly, shares of the American energy firm NextEra Energy (NYSE:NEE) don’t seem particularly helpful under the context of best safe stocks for market crash. Down nearly 10% for the year through the May 5 session, NEE will require patience. However, the company also commands enormous relevancies for its renewable infrastructure network. Plus, power companies tend to enjoy natural monopolies.Over the past 365 days, NEE did return shareholders almost 7%; thus, it’s not a completely speculative idea. Now, like other regulated utilities, NextEra doesn’t command the greatest financial stats if we’re being honest. For instance, its three-year revenue growth rate is only 2.3%, which is poor compared to the wider industry. However, NextEra benefits from consistent profitability. Also, its net margin smokes the field at 26.97%, above 90.85% of its peers. With a return on equity of 17.31%, it’s also one of the high-quality defensive stocks to consider.Looking to the Street, analysts peg NEE as a consensus strong buy. Their average price target comes out to $89.64, implying nearly 19% upside potential.Kelly Services (KELYA)tree growing on coin of stacking with green bokeh background; growth stocksSource: Freedom365day / Shutterstock.comWhile keeping in the spirit of best safe stocks for market crash, I’m going to dial up the risk-reward factor with the last two ideas. First, staffing agency Kelly Services (NASDAQ:KELYA) might be a compelling idea to consider. Sure, since the beginning of this year, KELYA slipped more than 4%. Also, in the past month, it dipped 1%, which seemingly doesn’t offer much confidence.However, I’m almost certain that KELYA deserves to be one of the recession-proof stocks to buy now because of layoffs. With pink slips flying across other industries besides technology, desperation should make Kelly Services interesting. Also, the company differs from other staffing firms in that it covers a wide footprint, including manufacturing and logistics.Financially, investors will point to Kelly’s three-year revenue growth rate of 1.6% below zero. However, the company suffered disproportionately during the Covid-19 crisis. With the pandemic fading but worker desperation rising, Kelly stands ready to rock and roll. Lastly, analysts peg KELYA as a moderate buy. Their average price target hits $24, implying nearly 48% upside potential. Thus, the experts believe it’s one of the low-risk high-reward stocks.Mercury General (MCY)Stocks to buy: smartphone with the words ""buy"" and ""sell"" displayed on the screen. The user's finger is about to press buy. Stock charts are in the background of the image.Source: Chompoo Suriyo / Shutterstock.comUnderstandably, investors have less-volatile options for best safe stocks for market crash than Mercury General (NYSE:MCY). However, as you’ll see later, the upside for MCY may be phenomenal. Nevertheless, investors shouldn’t ignore the risk. Since the Jan. opener, MCY fell slightly more than 14%. In the trailing one-year period, it’s down a staggering 41%. Of course, I have some explaining to do.Fundamentally, I appreciate Mercury’s auto insurance business. Let’s face it – the roadways aren’t getting any safer. And people just seem to be on edge these days, meaning that financial protection is a must. Also, for the vast majority of states in the Union, auto insurance is the law. Therefore, Mercury benefits from a captive audience. To be sure, Mercury suffered from the Covid-19 crisis. For instance, its three-year revenue growth rate sits at 2.9% below zero. Also, its book growth rate is 5.4% below breakeven.Nevertheless, well-respected Raymond James analyst Charles Peters pegs MCY a buy. Also, the expert forecasts a price target of $45, implying over 52% upside potential.On the date of publication, Josh Enomoto did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.A former senior business analyst for Sony Electronics, Josh Enomoto has helped broker major contracts with Fortune Global 500 companies.

The dividend yield will be 2.2% based on this payment which is still above the industry average. View our latest analysis for Masco Masco's Payment Has Solid Earnings CoverageIf the payments aren't sustainable, a high yield for a few years won't matter that much. Before making this announcement, Masco was easily earning enough to cover the dividend. As a result, a large proportion of what it earned was being reinvested back into the business.Over the next year, EPS is forecast to expand by 22.1%. If the dividend continues along recent trends, we estimate the payout ratio will be 30%, which is in the range that makes us comfortable with the sustainability of the dividend.historic-dividendMasco Has A Solid Track RecordThe company has an extended history of paying stable dividends. The annual payment during the last 10 years was $0.30 in 2013, and the most recent fiscal year payment was $1.14. This means that it has been growing its distributions at 14% per annum over that time. We can see that payments have shown some very nice upward momentum without faltering, which provides some reassurance that future payments will also be reliable.The Dividend Looks Likely To GrowInvestors who have held shares in the company for the past few years will be happy with the dividend income they have received. Masco has seen EPS rising for the last five years, at 16% per annum. With a decent amount of growth and a low payout ratio, we think this bodes well for Masco's prospects of growing its dividend payments in the future.Masco Looks Like A Great Dividend StockIn summary, it is good to see that the dividend is staying consistent, and we don't think there is any reason to suspect this might change over the medium term. The company is easily earning enough to cover its dividend payments and it is great to see that these earnings are being translated into cash flow. Taking this all into consideration, this looks like it could be a good dividend opportunity.Story continuesMarket movements attest to how highly valued a consistent dividend policy is compared to one which is more unpredictable. However, there are other things to consider for investors when analysing stock performance. To that end, Masco has 2 warning signs (and 1 which can't be ignored) we think you should know about.

Number of passenger cars to hit lowest point since 1978; aftermarket repair opportunities to surge with more light trucks on road SOUTHFIELD, Mich., May 15, 2023 /PRNewswire/ -- With more than 284 million vehicles in operation (VIO) on U.S. roads, the average age of cars and light trucks in the US has risen again this year to a new record of 12.5 years, up by more than three months over 2022, according to the latest analysis from S&amp;P Global Mobility. The growth is in line with the firm's prediction from last year that constrained new vehicle sales would continue to impact and put upward pressure on the average age. In addition, the continued rise of light trucks/utilities means the number of passenger cars on the road will fall beneath 100 million for the first time since 1978.This is the sixth straight year of increase in the average vehicle age of the U.S. fleet.  It also reflects the highest yearly increase since the 2008-2009 recession, which caused acceleration in average age beyond its traditional rate due to the sharp decline in new-vehicle sales demand.In 2022, the average age experienced upward pressure initially due to supply constraints that caused low levels of new vehicle inventory, and then by slowing demand as interest rates and inflation reduced consumer demand in the second half of the year. The combined effect caused retail and fleet sales of new light vehicles in the US to drop 8% from 2021's 14.6 million units to 13.9 million units in 2022, the lowest level recorded in over a decade.Average age by vehicle type, Source: S&amp;P Global Mobility""We expected the confluence of factors impacting the fleet coming out of 2021 would provide further upward pressure on average vehicle age.  But the pressure was amplified in the back half of 2022 as interest rates and inflation began to take their toll,"" said Todd Campau, associate director of aftermarket solutions for S&amp;P Global Mobility.Story continuesDespite economic headwinds, new vehicle sales are projected to surpass 14.5 million units in 2023, according to S&amp;P Global Mobility forecasts, which is expected to curb the rate of average age growth in the coming year. ""While pressure will remain on average age in 2023, we expect the curve to begin to flatten this year as we look toward returning to historical norms for new vehicle sales in 2024,"" said Campau.Favorable business pipeline for the aftermarketThe increased pace of growth of the average light vehicle age benefits the vehicle service industry. An older fleet means vehicles will continue to need repair work and service to perform correctly.The aftermarket sector trajectory typically follows growth in average vehicle age, as consumers invest more to keep their aging vehicles running, barring some exceptions. As a result, the most recent S&amp;P Global Channel Forecast conducted jointly with Auto Care Association and MEMA Aftermarket Suppliers, estimates revenues of the U.S. light duty aftermarket in 2022 have grown to $356.5 billion, up more than 8.5% over 2021, For this year, early indications from the same forecast estimate a potential revenue increase in 2023 of 5% or more, prior to adjustments for inflation and other factors. The newest Channel Forecast is set to be published in June.According to S&amp;P Global Mobility, the volumes of vehicles ages 6-14 will grow by another 10 million units by 2028, adding to an already favorable volume of vehicles in the aftermarket target range.""Traditionally, the 'sweet spot' for aftermarket repair was considered 6-11 years of age, but with average age at 12.5 years, the sweet spot for aftermarket repair is growing,"" said Campau. ""There are almost 122 million vehicles in operation over 12 years old.""In total, vehicles older than six years will account for more than 74% of the vehicle fleet in 2028, according to S&amp;P Global Mobility estimates. These vehicles drive the most repair opportunities, and should serve as a positive trend for the independent aftermarket.New vehicle market skews further in favor of light trucks Light truck/utility growth has trended upward for several years, and in 2022, 78% of all new vehicles registered in the US last year were in this category. Given the exponential growth of the sport-utility segment, VIO has shifted as well – with light trucks/utilities representing nearly 63% of the population.Strong consumer preference for light trucks over cars points to a growing business potential for the vehicle service industry, as light trucks/utilities generally cost more to maintain than cars, and people also tend to keep them longer. Our analysis shows that within the next 18-24 months, the total volume of passenger cars – sedans, coupes, wagons, hatchbacks – on the road in the US could drop below 100 million for the first time since 1978. By 2028, we expect at least 70% of VIO in the U.S. to be light trucks/utilities.Volume of VIO by vehicle type, Source: S&amp;P Global MobilityBEV average age remains under pressureThe average age of battery electric vehicles (BEVs) in the US is 3.6 years this year, down from 3.7 years last year. The average age has been hovering between 3 and 4 years since 2017 and is largely compressed as the new BEV registrations continue to grow. According to S&amp;P Global Mobility estimates, new BEV registrations achieved a 58% gain year over year, to nearly 758,000 units in 2022.However, the average age of BEVs is under pressure as BEVs are leaving the fleet more rapidly than their ICE and diesel counterparts.According to S&amp;P Global Mobility analysis, of the nearly 2.3 million BEV's registered in the U.S. from 2013 to 2022, about 2.12 million are still on the road today – about 6.6% have left the fleet. When it comes to other fuel types excluding BEVs, of the roughly 158 million sold in the same timeframe, are around 149.8 million vehicles on the road today – reflecting that 5.2% have left the fleet over the time horizon.About S&amp;P Global MobilityAt S&amp;P Global Mobility, we provide invaluable insights derived from unmatched automotive data, enabling our customers to anticipate change and make decisions with conviction.

While there are more than 24,000 cryptocurrencies in the world, Bitcoin dominates the industry by having a share of 46% of the market capitalization. Meanwhile, the top 10 cryptocurrencies take up over 85% of the total market capitalization. According to Statista, the cryptocurrency industry is forecasted to generate a total revenue of $37.87 billion in 2023. The topline is expected to compound at an annual rate of 14.40% by 2027 to reach a total sum of $64.87 billion. As of 2023, the number of cryptocurrency users stands at 673 million globally, and this is expected to rise to 994.3 million by 2027.Binance, a leading cryptocurrency exchange, has been known for maintaining its dominance over other popular cryptocurrency exchanges. However, after implementing a recent policy change that discontinued zero-fee trading, Binance experienced a significant decline in its dominance in the spot trading market. Data provided by reputable analytics firm Kaiko revealed that Binance's share of spot trading declined from 73% to 51% following the policy alteration. As of May 6, the data indicates that Binance's reduced market share has benefited exchanges based in Asia, such as Huobi and OKX. These exchanges have gained 8% and 4% in trading volume, respectively. Additionally, South Korean exchanges saw substantial growth, collectively increasing their market share from 8% to 14%. This shift in the competitive landscape of the cryptocurrency market is significant and has caused many to reassess their strategies.One of the major trends in the cryptocurrency industry is its adoption by institutions like banks, hedge funds, and corporations. This has resulted in an influx of capital into the industry, which has contributed to the growth of the market. US financial services firms are actively developing their own blockchain-based platforms, which include digital currencies, to facilitate business-to-business (B2B) cryptocurrency transactions. In October 2020, PayPal Holdings Inc (NASDAQ:PYPL) unveiled its initiative enabling customers to purchase, sell, and hold Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies through their PayPal accounts. This integration allowed customers to utilize their cryptocurrency assets for purchases from the vast network of 26 million PayPal Holdings Inc's (NASDAQ:PYPL) merchants. Similarly, companies like Mastercard Inc (NYSE:MA) and Visa Inc (NYSE:V) have also forged relationships with crypto exchanges like Gemini and Binance to issue crypto-linked payment cards.Story continuesAt the same time, regulatory scrutiny on the digital currency industry has intensified following the downfall of FTX, a crypto exchange, in the previous year. In March, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission cautioned Coinbase, an American crypto exchange, regarding potential violations of securities laws. In response, Coinbase's CEO, Brian Armstrong, stated that the company is bracing itself for a protracted legal dispute with the SEC. Similarly, the Commodity Futures and Trading Commission accused Binance, a crypto exchange, of contravening trading regulations in March. These instances act as a reminder of the constantly changing environment and the necessity for cryptocurrency exchanges to adhere to regulatory guidelines.Best Cryptocurrency Exchanges and Apps in May 2023bitcoin mining Our MethodologyWe used a consensus opinion-based methodology to shortlist the best cryptocurrency exchanges and apps in May 2023.

59,a9a1f6ab-1545-305a-8646-3bd7669fe47d,EXPE,2023-05-15,Interview: Expedia CEO on How Its AI Rollouts Would Be Impossible for Prior Regimes,Skift,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/interview-expedia-ceo-ai-rollouts-063000664.html,1684132200,STORY,"['EXPE', 'ABNB']","[Expedia Group CEO Peter Kern spoke at its partner conference at headquarters in Seattle on May 9, 2023. In an interview with Skift, Kern discussed generative AI and the competitive landscape. Source: Expedia GroupExpedia Group CEO Peter Kern, who’s been working on revamping the company since April 2020, said “it would’ve been impossible for the old us, three years ago,” to have been nimble enough to be among the first movers in generative AI among online travel companies.Expedia’s iOS app now has a ChatGPT chatbot, and the company rolled out a plug-in for OpenAI’s ChatGPT platform. Booking Holdings’ Kayak and Opentable have plug-ins, as well.It’s impossible to know if ex-Expedia CEOs Dara Khosrowshahi (2005-2017) and Mark Okerstrom (2017-2019) could have introduced ChatGPT tools as fast as the company did under Kern, and he wasn’t looking to disparage his predecessors. You can make an argument that the two former CEOs could have done it, as well.But Kern, who thinks the toughest big lifts are behind him other than a loyalty program launch coming in July and getting vacation rental brand Vrbo onto the Expedia tech stack, has been busy remaking Expedia over the last three years. He has shed brands, prioritized the big three Expedia, Hotels.com and Vrbo among formerly a couple dozen units, and consolidated teams across the company so they aren’t focused on one particular brand or another.In a Skift interview last week, Kern discussed the promise and hype of generative AI, and how he doesn’t count out Google from eventually delivering a viable tool.However, he hopes Bing will gain ground with its investment in OpenAI to ensure a more competitive search engine environment.Kern scoffed at a statement from Airbnb CEO Brian Chesky that Airbnb will be a transformed company in another year because of generative AI.“In a year? We’ve been at this a long time,” Kern said. Airbnb isn’t a newbie, though, to artificial intelligence, either.Kern also had some good things to say about app-only online travel agency Hopper, but disparaged some of its fintech products — Kern called them “insure-tech” — as being a ripoff to consumers.As people return to big cities, Expedia will start to focus on urban short-term rental inventory, which is not Vrbo’s strength. However, don’t expect to find private rooms on Expedia, Hotels.com or Vrbo.Story continuesRead the interview, which has been edited for clarity and trimmed, below. Dennis Schaal: Did you get an advantage with ChatGPT because OpenAi CEO Sam Altman is on your board?Peter Kern: Look, Sam’s obviously a thought leader in the space, but we didn’t have any inside track to what was happening, or when it was coming. We didn’t know anything.”Schaal: He wasn’t at the board meetings saying “Guys, wait until you see this?”Kern: No, he was saying, “We’re working on this great stuff, it’s going to change everything.” But he was saying that to the world. It wasn’t any secret. And then when it came, we just reacted quickly. But as I’ve said a couple times, I said it in earnings, we’ve been on our own AI/ML (artificial intelligence/machine learning) journey for awhile.Schaal: For years and years?Kern: I think it was Brian Chesky who said, “In a year, the product’s going to be so different because of AI.” I said, “In a year? We’ve been at this a long time.” Other companies got in the game. We weren’t the only ones. But we have a commitment to this. We’ve come a long way, technologically. So it wasn’t easy, but it would’ve been impossible for the old us, three years ago. We went after it. I think we’ve done a really good job. I think we’ve stayed on our front foot about how we can use it. But again, I think it’s too early to say it’s going to change everything for partners, for customers, and for service. We’re going to have to see how the customer reacts to it.I was with somebody yesterday where I said, “It’s like Alexa, it was the coolest thing in the world.” And we were all talking about audio commerce. That didn’t really happen. I’m a doubter. And we don’t really have a horse in the race. We don’t want it to work, or not work. We just want to put the best stuff in front of our customers, to make the experience as good as it can be. And as a betting man, I’ll say half the stuff we try will be beneficial, and the other half won’t be. And it will end up in the middle somewhere.Schaal: Are you buying the argument that Google will be the biggest loser of generative AI, namely Google search?Kern: I think if ChatGPT were the last word on generative AI, and nobody else could build it? Maybe. I think Google will have theirs. Amazon will have theirs, Facebook will have one. All these big guys are going to build generative AI. And I don’t know whose is going to be better or worse. I think it’s probably hasty to assume that they will lose because of it. hope and think that it can and should make Bing more competitive than it has been. And we would love a more competitive market for search.Schaal: What has been the feedback from hotels about your new loyalty program One Key (slated to debut July 6)? Don’t some hotels, particularly say smaller hotel groups, see this as a threat to their own loyalty programs?Kern: We haven’t seen that. Listen, I think everybody, anytime you start talking about loyalty, everybody gets very parochial. There are Bonvoy super users, or Hilton Honors super users, or American Airline super users. And then there’s everybody else. In the everybody else of it all, there are a lot of people. A lot of people never earn much of anything. And as a result, you’re not really engendering loyalty. You might sign them up, you might give them free wi-fi at the hotel, but they’re not making purchase decisions there.So for us, we’re trying to help with all the unloyal, if you will. We’re bringing way more new customers to all our partners. So they get a shot on goal.So we are there to help. And we think our loyalty program’s the best thing, and will be the best in class. It will certainly be better than any other OTA (online travel agency). Airbnb doesn’t have it. Booking (Holdings) has discounting.Schaal: Airbnb might not need it.Kern: You play the hand that you have. So I’m not saying we will therefore dominate Airbnb. I’m just saying, if you have a choice between us and them, and you can find a comparable property, I’d like to think you’d choose us. Because then you could use your points to go buy an airline ticket, and take it on your next trip. And Booking has a different model with discounting and other stuff. We’re going to have all the member discounts. But we will go the extra mile and put some points and value in your account. So I think it’s a good program that helps everybody. There may still be some misgivings floating around, but I hope we’ve done a good job of convincing everyone. We’re not assuming we’re going to steal all your best customers and make them permanent users of us. We’re just trying to make sure we are the best marketplace for them.Schaal: So one thing I didn’t understand. You know how Booking is always bragging that it’s the hotels that fund their loyalty program? And then you guys have said that “unlike some competitors,” who I assume is Booking, that you fund all the cash back. So what does that mean exactly?Kern: So there are a plethora of benefits. They are different. So when you think about a member discount, we are going to have silver and gold tiers. So they will be larger bigger discounts. And those will be hotel supplied.Schaal: So the hotels are basically paying for that?Kern: The whole crux of Booking’s Genius Program since its beginning essentially is the idea of a closed universe of customers with special prices. And they did a really aggressive job, and it was earlier than us, of leveraging the long tail of hotels to get these discounts, and have very competitive pricing, all funded by the suppliers. We do that, but we also give value in the form of loyalty points or what will be One Key Cash. They did a great job of promoting their discount model. They got everybody to pay for it. We didn’t do as good a job of promoting what were very pervasive discounts. And now we will make it more prominent, and give people more value.Schaal: If somebody asks you, how much bigger is Expedia’s B2B segment than Booking’s? Do you have any kind of idea how much bigger Expedia’s is?Kern: I don’t know. They acquired Getaroom in 2021.Schaal: But they’re a way distant second, aren’t they, would you say?Kern: Yes, I would say so. I’m not even 100 percent positive they’re second. But yes, we are a much bigger business than them.Schaal:  I was speaking to someone at Hopper about its B2B partnerships and they were saying that one of the advantages that Hopper has is that players like you have older technology, and Hopper can customize better. They can roll out new partnerships much faster.Kern: Did they tell you about all those partnerships?Schaal: They told me about a couple (Capital One, Uber, Agoda, and Marriott).Kern: They got to build their technology later. I think Hopper’s an interesting company. We do business with Hopper with our supply. Their biggest partner’s obviously Capital One, which invested in them. The other partnerships, from what I’ve heard, are pretty modest. They have some interesting products. But I think, as I said earlier, if you’re a bank or an airline, you spend all of this money acquiring a customer that you think is a loyal customer, and then do you want to go risk your business on their technology. We think our technology’s great, but I’m not saying their technology isn’t interesting. And all of their “insure-tech?” OK. We do certain Insure-tech things, but we don’t believe in a lot of the products they sell as a customer experience. So that’s a difference. But I don’t think anyone is doing more to innovate the shopping experience than us. So I think it’s a choice about certainty.Schaal: So you were saying, some of their so-called insure-tech products you don’t believe in? What are some of those products?Kern: I think they have a lot of products around insuring against every little thing. It’s going to rain, it’s going to do this, it’s going to do that. And to me, if you can afford to sell those products, then the customer’s not winning in that trade. It doesn’t mean customers won’t pay for it. It doesn’t mean maybe some won’t be happy with it. But it reminds me of the days back when you and I used to travel, when there was the box you put the envelope in for air insurance. So if you were afraid to get on the plane, you’d put $20 in the box, and then just in case the plane went down, your family would get a million dollars.Do they (Hopper) offer some things that people buy? Sure. Do the customers really benefit from that? Do you really want to sell them that stuff? They have some good product, don’t get me wrong. I’m just saying there are a lot of things they do that we we choose not to do. We don’t think it’s a good consumer experience.Schaal: I think you said in the earnings call that demand for Vrbo was flattening a little bit, with people returning to cities. So do you see Vrbo’s all-star status declining somewhat compared to how it took off during the pandemic?Kern: Vrbo is a great product. Vrbo got a step function improvement in people experiencing it during Covid, just like Airbnb did. That’s all great for us. But when the market cycles to people returning to Paris then Vrbo has some Paris exposure. But it doesn’t compare to our hotel exposure. So there are rebalancing things that happened there. We’re not trying to make one business grow at the expense of another. We’re trying to make the whole business grow. And if we are net up a lot, and Vrbo is a little slower, and hotels are really good, that’s OK for us.Schaal: You said you had some urban short-term rental inventory on Expedia as opposed to it being on Vrbo? Will there be any kind of a new focus on urban inventory or multifamily buildings?Kern: Yeah, we’re starting to focus on urban, but again, we’re focusing on it through our lens. We’re not, certainly not yet, and maybe never, in the shared rental space where you’d get a private room in somebody’s place. And, of course, we want to grow where there’s demand. We won’t hit every $80 room. But we will get the guests who say, “Oh, I’m going to rent a whole apartment for my family for $600 per night, instead of a two hotel rooms, or a three-bed hotel.” Yes, we’ll do that.Note: This story was updated and edited after initial publication to improve the flow of the conversation.

However, a closer look at its sound financials might cause you to think again. Given that fundamentals usually drive long-term market outcomes, the company is worth looking at. Specifically, we decided to study Johnson &amp; Johnson's  ROE in this article.ROE or return on equity is a useful tool to assess how effectively a company can generate returns on the investment it received from its shareholders. In other words, it is a profitability ratio which measures the rate of return on the capital provided by the company's shareholders. See our latest analysis for Johnson &amp; Johnson How Do You Calculate Return On Equity?Return on equity can be calculated by using the formula:Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' EquitySo, based on the above formula, the ROE for Johnson &amp; Johnson is:18% = US$13b ÷ US$71b (Based on the trailing twelve months to April 2023).The 'return' refers to a company's earnings over the last year. One way to conceptualize this is that for each $1 of shareholders' capital it has, the company made $0.18 in profit.Why Is ROE Important For Earnings Growth?So far, we've learned that ROE is a measure of a company's profitability. We now need to evaluate how much profit the company reinvests or ""retains"" for future growth which then gives us an idea about the growth potential of the company. Assuming all else is equal, companies that have both a higher return on equity and higher profit retention are usually the ones that have a higher growth rate when compared to companies that don't have the same features.A Side By Side comparison of Johnson &amp; Johnson's Earnings Growth And 18% ROETo start with, Johnson &amp; Johnson's ROE looks acceptable. Further, the company's ROE is similar to the industry average of 18%. Consequently, this likely laid the ground for the decent growth of 18% seen over the past five years by Johnson &amp; Johnson.Story continuesNext, on comparing with the industry net income growth, we found that Johnson &amp; Johnson's growth is quite high when compared to the industry average growth of 12% in the same period, which is great to see.past-earnings-growthEarnings growth is an important metric to consider when valuing a stock. What investors need to determine next is if the expected earnings growth, or the lack of it, is already built into the share price. Doing so will help them establish if the stock's future looks promising or ominous. What is JNJ worth today? The  intrinsic value infographic in our free research report  helps visualize whether JNJ is currently mispriced by the market.Is Johnson &amp; Johnson Using Its Retained Earnings Effectively?Johnson &amp; Johnson has a significant three-year median payout ratio of 61%, meaning that it is left with only 39% to reinvest into its business. This implies that the company has been able to achieve decent earnings growth despite returning most of its profits to shareholders.Besides, Johnson &amp; Johnson has been paying dividends for at least ten years or more. This shows that the company is committed to sharing profits with its shareholders. Existing analyst estimates suggest that the company's future payout ratio is expected to drop to 45% over the next three years. As a result, the expected drop in Johnson &amp; Johnson's payout ratio explains the anticipated rise in the company's future ROE to 34%, over the same period.SummaryOn the whole, we feel that Johnson &amp; Johnson's performance has been quite good. In particular, its high ROE is quite noteworthy and also the probable explanation behind its considerable earnings growth. Yet, the company is retaining a small portion of its profits. Which means that the company has been able to grow its earnings in spite of it, so that's not too bad. That being so, a study of the latest analyst forecasts show that the company is expected to see a slowdown in its future earnings growth.

Many cancers are considered most treatable and potentially curable in their earliest stage of disease. Building on the strong understanding of the role of KEYTRUDA in later-stage cancers, Merck is studying KEYTRUDA in earlier disease states, with approximately 20 ongoing registrational studies across multiple types of cancer.About KEYTRUDA® (pembrolizumab) injection, 100 mgKEYTRUDA is an anti-programmed death receptor-1 (PD-1) therapy that works by increasing the ability of the body’s immune system to help detect and fight tumor cells. KEYTRUDA is a humanized monoclonal antibody that blocks the interaction between PD-1 and its ligands, PD-L1 and PD-L2, thereby activating T lymphocytes which may affect both tumor cells and healthy cells.Merck has the industry’s largest immuno-oncology clinical research program. There are currently more than 1,600 trials studying KEYTRUDA across a wide variety of cancers and treatment settings. The KEYTRUDA clinical program seeks to understand the role of KEYTRUDA across cancers and the factors that may predict a patient's likelihood of benefitting from treatment with KEYTRUDA, including exploring several different biomarkers.Selected KEYTRUDA (pembrolizumab) Indications in the U.S.MelanomaKEYTRUDA is indicated for the treatment of patients with unresectable or metastatic melanoma.KEYTRUDA is indicated for the adjuvant treatment of adult and pediatric (12 years and older) patients with stage IIB, IIC, or III melanoma following complete resection.Non-Small Cell Lung CancerKEYTRUDA, in combination with pemetrexed and platinum chemotherapy, is indicated for the first-line treatment of patients with metastatic nonsquamous non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), with no EGFR or ALK genomic tumor aberrations.KEYTRUDA, in combination with carboplatin and either paclitaxel or paclitaxel protein-bound, is indicated for the first-line treatment of patients with metastatic squamous NSCLC.KEYTRUDA, as a single agent, is indicated for the first-line treatment of patients with NSCLC expressing PD-L1 [tumor proportion score (TPS) ≥1%] as determined by an FDA-approved test, with no EGFR or ALK genomic tumor aberrations, and is:stage III where patients are not candidates for surgical resection or definitive chemoradiation, ormetastatic.KEYTRUDA, as a single agent, is indicated for the treatment of patients with metastatic NSCLC whose tumors express PD-L1 (TPS ≥1%) as determined by an FDA-approved test, with disease progression on or after platinum-containing chemotherapy. Patients with EGFR or ALK genomic tumor aberrations should have disease progression on FDA-approved therapy for these aberrations prior to receiving KEYTRUDA.KEYTRUDA, as a single agent, is indicated as adjuvant treatment following resection and platinum-based chemotherapy for adult patients with Stage IB (T2a ≥4 cm), II, or IIIA NSCLC.Classical Hodgkin LymphomaKEYTRUDA is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with relapsed or refractory classical Hodgkin lymphoma (cHL).KEYTRUDA is indicated for the treatment of pediatric patients with refractory cHL, or cHL that has relapsed after 2 or more lines of therapy.Primary Mediastinal Large B-Cell LymphomaKEYTRUDA is indicated for the treatment of adult and pediatric patients with refractory primary mediastinal large B-cell lymphoma (PMBCL), or who have relapsed after 2 or more prior lines of therapy.KEYTRUDA is not recommended for treatment of patients with PMBCL who require urgent cytoreductive therapy.Urothelial CarcinomaKEYTRUDA, in combination with enfortumab vedotin, is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with locally advanced or metastatic urothelial carcinoma (mUC) who are not eligible for cisplatin-containing chemotherapy.This indication is approved under accelerated approval based on tumor response rate and durability of response. Continued approval for this indication may be contingent upon verification and description of clinical benefit in the confirmatory trials.KEYTRUDA, as a single agent, is indicated for the treatment of patients with locally advanced or metastatic urothelial carcinoma (mUC):who are not eligible for any platinum-containing chemotherapy, orwho have disease progression during or following platinum-containing chemotherapy or within 12 months of neoadjuvant or adjuvant treatment with platinum-containing chemotherapy.KEYTRUDA, as a single agent, is indicated for the treatment of patients with Bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG)-unresponsive, high-risk, non-muscle invasive bladder cancer (NMIBC) with carcinoma in situ (CIS) with or without papillary tumors who are ineligible for or have elected not to undergo cystectomy.Gastric CancerKEYTRUDA, in combination with trastuzumab, fluoropyrimidine- and platinum-containing chemotherapy, is indicated for the first-line treatment of patients with locally advanced unresectable or metastatic HER2-positive gastric or gastroesophageal junction (GEJ) adenocarcinoma.This indication is approved under accelerated approval based on tumor response rate and durability of response. Continued approval for this indication may be contingent upon verification and description of clinical benefit in the confirmatory trials.Esophageal CancerKEYTRUDA is indicated for the treatment of patients with locally advanced or metastatic esophageal or gastroesophageal junction (GEJ) (tumors with epicenter 1 to 5 centimeters above the GEJ) carcinoma that is not amenable to surgical resection or definitive chemoradiation either:in combination with platinum- and fluoropyrimidine-based chemotherapy, oras a single agent after one or more prior lines of systemic therapy for patients with tumors of squamous cell histology that express PD-L1 (CPS ≥10) as determined by an FDA-approved test.Cervical CancerKEYTRUDA, in combination with chemotherapy, with or without bevacizumab, is indicated for the treatment of patients with persistent, recurrent, or metastatic cervical cancer whose tumors express PD-L1 (CPS ≥1) as determined by an FDA-approved test.KEYTRUDA, as a single agent, is indicated for the treatment of patients with recurrent or metastatic cervical cancer with disease progression on or after chemotherapy whose tumors express PD-L1 (CPS ≥1) as determined by an FDA-approved test.Renal Cell CarcinomaKEYTRUDA, in combination with axitinib, is indicated for the first-line treatment of adult patients with advanced renal cell carcinoma (RCC).KEYTRUDA, in combination with LENVIMA, is indicated for the first-line treatment of adult patients with advanced RCC.KEYTRUDA is indicated for the adjuvant treatment of patients with RCC at intermediate-high or high risk of recurrence following nephrectomy, or following nephrectomy and resection of metastatic lesions.Selected Important Safety Information for KEYTRUDASevere and Fatal Immune-Mediated Adverse ReactionsKEYTRUDA is a monoclonal antibody that belongs to a class of drugs that bind to either the PD-1 or the PD-L1, blocking the PD-1/PD-L1 pathway, thereby removing inhibition of the immune response, potentially breaking peripheral tolerance and inducing immune-mediated adverse reactions. Immune-mediated adverse reactions, which may be severe or fatal, can occur in any organ system or tissue, can affect more than one body system simultaneously, and can occur at any time after starting treatment or after discontinuation of treatment. Important immune-mediated adverse reactions listed here may not include all possible severe and fatal immune-mediated adverse reactions.Monitor patients closely for symptoms and signs that may be clinical manifestations of underlying immune-mediated adverse reactions. Early identification and management are essential to ensure safe use of anti–PD-1/PD-L1 treatments. Evaluate liver enzymes, creatinine, and thyroid function at baseline and periodically during treatment. For patients with TNBC treated with KEYTRUDA in the neoadjuvant setting, monitor blood cortisol at baseline, prior to surgery, and as clinically indicated. In cases of suspected immune-mediated adverse reactions, initiate appropriate workup to exclude alternative etiologies, including infection. Institute medical management promptly, including specialty consultation as appropriate.Withhold or permanently discontinue KEYTRUDA depending on severity of the immune-mediated adverse reaction. In general, if KEYTRUDA requires interruption or discontinuation, administer systemic corticosteroid therapy (1 to 2 mg/kg/day prednisone or equivalent) until improvement to Grade 1 or less. Upon improvement to Grade 1 or less, initiate corticosteroid taper and continue to taper over at least 1 month. Consider administration of other systemic immunosuppressants in patients whose adverse reactions are not controlled with corticosteroid therapy.Immune-Mediated PneumonitisKEYTRUDA can cause immune-mediated pneumonitis. The incidence is higher in patients who have received prior thoracic radiation. Immune-mediated pneumonitis occurred in 3.4% (94/2799) of patients receiving KEYTRUDA, including fatal (0.1%), Grade 4 (0.3%), Grade 3 (0.9%), and Grade 2 (1.3%) reactions. Systemic corticosteroids were required in 67% (63/94) of patients. Pneumonitis led to permanent discontinuation of KEYTRUDA in 1.3% (36) and withholding in 0.9% (26) of patients. All patients who were withheld reinitiated KEYTRUDA after symptom improvement; of these, 23% had recurrence. Pneumonitis resolved in 59% of the 94 patients.Pneumonitis occurred in 8% (31/389) of adult patients with cHL receiving KEYTRUDA as a single agent, including Grades 3-4 in 2.3% of patients. Patients received high-dose corticosteroids for a median duration of 10 days (range: 2 days to 53 months). Pneumonitis rates were similar in patients with and without prior thoracic radiation. Pneumonitis led to discontinuation of KEYTRUDA in 5.4% (21) of patients. Of the patients who developed pneumonitis, 42% interrupted KEYTRUDA, 68% discontinued KEYTRUDA, and 77% had resolution.Pneumonitis occurred in 7% (41/580) of adult patients with resected NSCLC who received KEYTRUDA as a single agent for adjuvant treatment of NSCLC, including fatal (0.2%), Grade 4 (0.3%), and Grade 3 (1%) adverse reactions. Patients received high-dose corticosteroids for a median duration of 10 days (range: 1 day to 2.3 months). Pneumonitis led to discontinuation of KEYTRUDA in 26 (4.5%) of patients. Of the patients who developed pneumonitis, 54% interrupted KEYTRUDA, 63% discontinued KEYTRUDA, and 71% had resolution.Immune-Mediated ColitisKEYTRUDA can cause immune-mediated colitis, which may present with diarrhea. Cytomegalovirus infection/reactivation has been reported in patients with corticosteroid-refractory immune-mediated colitis. In cases of corticosteroid-refractory colitis, consider repeating infectious workup to exclude alternative etiologies. Immune-mediated colitis occurred in 1.7% (48/2799) of patients receiving KEYTRUDA, including Grade 4 (&lt;0.1%), Grade 3 (1.1%), and Grade 2 (0.4%) reactions. Systemic corticosteroids were required in 69% (33/48); additional immunosuppressant therapy was required in 4.2% of patients. Colitis led to permanent discontinuation of KEYTRUDA in 0.5% (15) and withholding in 0.5% (13) of patients. All patients who were withheld reinitiated KEYTRUDA after symptom improvement; of these, 23% had recurrence. Colitis resolved in 85% of the 48 patients.Hepatotoxicity and Immune-Mediated HepatitisKEYTRUDA as a Single AgentKEYTRUDA can cause immune-mediated hepatitis. Immune-mediated hepatitis occurred in 0.7% (19/2799) of patients receiving KEYTRUDA, including Grade 4 (&lt;0.1%), Grade 3 (0.4%), and Grade 2 (0.1%) reactions. Systemic corticosteroids were required in 68% (13/19) of patients; additional immunosuppressant therapy was required in 11% of patients. Hepatitis led to permanent discontinuation of KEYTRUDA in 0.2% (6) and withholding in 0.3% (9) of patients. All patients who were withheld reinitiated KEYTRUDA after symptom improvement; of these, none had recurrence. Hepatitis resolved in 79% of the 19 patients.KEYTRUDA With AxitinibKEYTRUDA in combination with axitinib can cause hepatic toxicity. Monitor liver enzymes before initiation of and periodically throughout treatment. Consider monitoring more frequently as compared to when the drugs are administered as single agents. For elevated liver enzymes, interrupt KEYTRUDA and axitinib, and consider administering corticosteroids as needed. With the combination of KEYTRUDA and axitinib, Grades 3 and 4 increased alanine aminotransferase (ALT) (20%) and increased aspartate aminotransferase (AST) (13%) were seen at a higher frequency compared to KEYTRUDA alone. Fifty-nine percent of the patients with increased ALT received systemic corticosteroids.

Cardiac/Vascular: Myocarditis, pericarditis, vasculitis; Nervous System: Meningitis, encephalitis, myelitis and demyelination, myasthenic syndrome/myasthenia gravis (including exacerbation), Guillain-Barré syndrome, nerve paresis, autoimmune neuropathy; Ocular: Uveitis, iritis and other ocular inflammatory toxicities can occur. Some cases can be associated with retinal detachment. Various grades of visual impairment, including blindness, can occur. If uveitis occurs in combination with other immune-mediated adverse reactions, consider a Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada-like syndrome, as this may require treatment with systemic steroids to reduce the risk of permanent vision loss; Gastrointestinal: Pancreatitis, to include increases in serum amylase and lipase levels, gastritis, duodenitis; Musculoskeletal and Connective Tissue: Myositis/polymyositis, rhabdomyolysis (and associated sequelae, including renal failure), arthritis (1.5%), polymyalgia rheumatica; Endocrine: Hypoparathyroidism; Hematologic/Immune: Hemolytic anemia, aplastic anemia, hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis, systemic inflammatory response syndrome, histiocytic necrotizing lymphadenitis (Kikuchi lymphadenitis), sarcoidosis, immune thrombocytopenic purpura, solid organ transplant rejection.Infusion-Related ReactionsKEYTRUDA can cause severe or life-threatening infusion-related reactions, including hypersensitivity and anaphylaxis, which have been reported in 0.2% of 2799 patients receiving KEYTRUDA. Monitor for signs and symptoms of infusion-related reactions. Interrupt or slow the rate of infusion for Grade 1 or Grade 2 reactions. For Grade 3 or Grade 4 reactions, stop infusion and permanently discontinue KEYTRUDA.Complications of Allogeneic Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation (HSCT)Fatal and other serious complications can occur in patients who receive allogeneic HSCT before or after anti–PD-1/PD-L1 treatments. Transplant-related complications include hyperacute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), acute and chronic GVHD, hepatic veno-occlusive disease after reduced intensity conditioning, and steroid-requiring febrile syndrome (without an identified infectious cause). These complications may occur despite intervening therapy between anti–PD-1/PD-L1 treatment and allogeneic HSCT. Follow patients closely for evidence of these complications and intervene promptly. Consider the benefit vs risks of using anti–PD-1/PD-L1 treatments prior to or after an allogeneic HSCT.Increased Mortality in Patients With Multiple MyelomaIn trials in patients with multiple myeloma, the addition of KEYTRUDA to a thalidomide analogue plus dexamethasone resulted in increased mortality. Treatment of these patients with an anti–PD-1/PD-L1 treatment in this combination is not recommended outside of controlled trials.Embryofetal ToxicityBased on its mechanism of action, KEYTRUDA can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Advise women of this potential risk. In females of reproductive potential, verify pregnancy status prior to initiating KEYTRUDA and advise them to use effective contraception during treatment and for 4 months after the last dose.Adverse ReactionsIn KEYNOTE-006, KEYTRUDA was discontinued due to adverse reactions in 9% of 555 patients with advanced melanoma; adverse reactions leading to permanent discontinuation in more than one patient were colitis (1.4%), autoimmune hepatitis (0.7%), allergic reaction (0.4%), polyneuropathy (0.4%), and cardiac failure (0.4%).

Across clinical studies of 1823 patients who received LENVIMA as a single agent, RPLS occurred in 0.3%. Confirm diagnosis of RPLS with MRI. Withhold and resume at reduced dose upon recovery or permanently discontinue depending on severity and persistence of neurologic symptoms.Hemorrhagic Events. Serious including fatal hemorrhagic events can occur with LENVIMA. In DTC, RCC, and HCC clinical trials, hemorrhagic events, of any grade, occurred in 29% of the 799 patients treated with LENVIMA as a single agent or in combination with everolimus. The most frequently reported hemorrhagic events (all grades and occurring in at least 5% of patients) were epistaxis and hematuria. In DTC, grade 3-5 hemorrhage occurred in 2% of LENVIMA-treated patients, including 1 fatal intracranial hemorrhage among 16 patients who received LENVIMA and had CNS metastases at baseline. In RCC, grade 3-5 hemorrhage occurred in 8% of LENVIMA + everolimus–treated patients, including 1 fatal cerebral hemorrhage. In HCC, grade 3-5 hemorrhage occurred in 5% of LENVIMA-treated patients, including 7 fatal hemorrhagic events. Serious tumor-related bleeds, including fatal hemorrhagic events, occurred in LENVIMA-treated patients in clinical trials and in the postmarketing setting. In postmarketing surveillance, serious and fatal carotid artery hemorrhages were seen more frequently in patients with anaplastic thyroid carcinoma (ATC) than other tumors. Safety and effectiveness of LENVIMA in patients with ATC have not been demonstrated in clinical trials.Consider the risk of severe or fatal hemorrhage associated with tumor invasion or infiltration of major blood vessels (eg, carotid artery). Withhold and resume at reduced dose upon recovery or permanently discontinue based on severity.Impairment of Thyroid Stimulating Hormone Suppression/Thyroid Dysfunction. LENVIMA impairs exogenous thyroid suppression. In DTC, 88% of patients had baseline thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) level ≤0.5 mU/L. In patients with normal TSH at baseline, elevation of TSH level &gt;0.5 mU/L was observed post baseline in 57% of LENVIMA-treated patients. In RCC and HCC, grade 1 or 2 hypothyroidism occurred in 24% of LENVIMA + everolimus–treated patients and 21% of LENVIMA-treated patients, respectively. In patients with normal or low TSH at baseline, elevation of TSH was observed post baseline in 70% of LENVIMA-treated patients in HCC and 60% of LENVIMA + everolimus–treated patients in RCC.Monitor thyroid function prior to initiation and at least monthly during treatment. Treat hypothyroidism according to standard medical practice.Impaired Wound Healing. Impaired wound healing has been reported in patients who received LENVIMA. Withhold LENVIMA for at least 1 week prior to elective surgery. Do not administer for at least 2 weeks following major surgery and until adequate wound healing. The safety of resumption of LENVIMA after resolution of wound healing complications has not been established.Osteonecrosis of the Jaw (ONJ). ONJ has been reported in patients receiving LENVIMA. Concomitant exposure to other risk factors, such as bisphosphonates, denosumab, dental disease, or invasive dental procedures, may increase the risk of ONJ.Perform an oral examination prior to treatment with LENVIMA and periodically during LENVIMA treatment. Advise patients regarding good oral hygiene practices and to consider having preventive dentistry performed prior to treatment with LENVIMA and throughout treatment with LENVIMA.Avoid invasive dental procedures, if possible, while on LENVIMA treatment, particularly in patients at higher risk. Withhold LENVIMA for at least 1 week prior to scheduled dental surgery or invasive dental procedures, if possible. For patients requiring invasive dental procedures, discontinuation of bisphosphonate treatment may reduce the risk of ONJ.Withhold LENVIMA if ONJ develops and restart based on clinical judgement of adequate resolution.Embryo‐Fetal Toxicity. Based on its mechanism of action and data from animal reproduction studies, LENVIMA can cause fetal harm when administered to pregnant women. In animal reproduction studies, oral administration of lenvatinib during organogenesis at doses below the recommended clinical doses resulted in embryotoxicity, fetotoxicity, and teratogenicity in rats and rabbits. Advise pregnant women of the potential risk to a fetus and advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with LENVIMA and for 30 days after the last dose.Adverse ReactionsIn DTC, the most common adverse reactions (≥30%) observed in LENVIMA-treated patients were hypertension (73%), fatigue (67%), diarrhea (67%), arthralgia/myalgia (62%), decreased appetite (54%), decreased weight (51%), nausea (47%), stomatitis (41%), headache (38%), vomiting (36%), proteinuria (34%), palmar-plantar erythrodysesthesia syndrome (32%), abdominal pain (31%), and dysphonia (31%).

Select patients for therapy based on an FDA-approved companion diagnostic for LYNPARZA.IMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATIONCONTRAINDICATIONSThere are no contraindications for LYNPARZA.WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONSMyelodysplastic Syndrome/Acute Myeloid Leukemia (MDS/AML): Occurred in approximately 1.5% of patients exposed to LYNPARZA monotherapy, and the majority of events had a fatal outcome. The median duration of therapy in patients who developed MDS/AML was 2 years (range: &lt;6 months to &gt;10 years). All of these patients had previous chemotherapy with platinum agents and/or other DNA-damaging agents, including radiotherapy.Do not start LYNPARZA until patients have recovered from hematological toxicity caused by previous chemotherapy (≤Grade 1). Monitor complete blood count for cytopenia at baseline and monthly thereafter for clinically significant changes during treatment. For prolonged hematological toxicities, interrupt LYNPARZA and monitor blood count weekly until recovery.If the levels have not recovered to Grade 1 or less after 4 weeks, refer the patient to a hematologist for further investigations, including bone marrow analysis and blood sample for cytogenetics. Discontinue LYNPARZA if MDS/AML is confirmed.Pneumonitis: Occurred in 0.8% of patients exposed to LYNPARZA monotherapy, and some cases were fatal. If patients present with new or worsening respiratory symptoms such as dyspnea, cough, and fever, or a radiological abnormality occurs, interrupt LYNPARZA treatment and initiate prompt investigation. Discontinue LYNPARZA if pneumonitis is confirmed and treat patient appropriately.Venous Thromboembolic Events (VTE): Including severe or fatal pulmonary embolism (PE) occurred in patients treated with LYNPARZA. VTE occurred in 7% of patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer who received LYNPARZA plus androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) compared to 3.1% of patients receiving enzalutamide or abiraterone plus ADT in the PROfound study. Patients receiving LYNPARZA and ADT had a 6% incidence of pulmonary embolism compared to 0.8% of patients treated with ADT plus either enzalutamide or abiraterone. Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of venous thrombosis and pulmonary embolism, and treat as medically appropriate, which may include long-term anticoagulation as clinically indicated.Embryo-Fetal Toxicity: Based on its mechanism of action and findings in animals, LYNPARZA can cause fetal harm.

and prolongation of myelosuppressive toxicity.CYP3A Inhibitors: Avoid coadministration of strong or moderate CYP3A inhibitors when using LYNPARZA. If a strong or moderate CYP3A inhibitor must be coadministered, reduce the dose of LYNPARZA. Advise patients to avoid grapefruit, grapefruit juice, Seville oranges, and Seville orange juice during LYNPARZA treatment.CYP3A Inducers: Avoid coadministration of strong or moderate CYP3A inducers when using LYNPARZA.USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONSLactation: No data are available regarding the presence of olaparib in human milk, its effects on the breastfed infant or on milk production. Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in the breastfed infant, advise a lactating woman not to breastfeed during treatment with LYNPARZA and for 1 month after receiving the final dose.Pediatric Use: The safety and efficacy of LYNPARZA have not been established in pediatric patients.Hepatic Impairment: No adjustment to the starting dose is required in patients with mild or moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh classification A and B). There are no data in patients with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh classification C).Renal Impairment: No dosage modification is recommended in patients with mild renal impairment (CLcr 51-80 mL/min estimated by Cockcroft-Gault). In patients with moderate renal impairment (CLcr 31-50 mL/min), reduce the dose of LYNPARZA to 200 mg twice daily. There are no data in patients with severe renal impairment or end-stage renal disease (CLcr ≤30 mL/min).Please see complete Prescribing Information, including Medication Guide.About WELIREG™ (belzutifan) 40 mg tablets, for oral useIndication in the U.S.WELIREG (belzutifan) is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) disease who require therapy for associated renal cell carcinoma (RCC), central nervous system (CNS) hemangioblastomas, or pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (pNET), not requiring immediate surgery.Selected Safety Information for WELIREGWarning: Embryo-Fetal ToxicityExposure to WELIREG during pregnancy can cause embryo-fetal harm. Verify pregnancy status prior to the initiation of WELIREG. Advise patients of these risks and the need for effective nonhormonal contraception as WELIREG can render some hormonal contraceptives ineffective.AnemiaWELIREG can cause severe anemia that can require blood transfusion. In Study 004, anemia occurred in 90% of patients and 7% had Grade 3 anemia. Median time to onset of anemia was 31 days (range: 1 day to 8.4 months). In Study 001, a clinical trial in patients with advanced solid tumors (n=58) treated at the recommended dose, anemia occurred in 76% of patients and 28% had Grade 3 anemia.Monitor for anemia before initiation of and periodically throughout treatment. Closely monitor patients who are dual UGT2B17 and CYP2C19 poor metabolizers due to potential increases in exposure that may increase the incidence or severity of anemia.Transfuse patients as clinically indicated. For patients with hemoglobin (Hb) &lt;9g/dL, withhold WELIREG until Hb≥9g/dL, then resume at reduced dose or permanently discontinue depending on the severity of anemia. For life-threatening anemia or when urgent intervention is indicated, withhold WELIREG until Hb ≥9g/dL, then resume at a reduced dose or permanently discontinue.The use of erythropoiesis stimulating agents (ESAs) for treatment of anemia is not recommended in patients treated with WELIREG.HypoxiaWELIREG can cause severe hypoxia that may require discontinuation, supplemental oxygen, or hospitalization. In Study 004, hypoxia occurred in 1.6% of patients. In Study 001, a clinical trial in patients with advanced solid tumors (n=58) treated at the recommended dose, hypoxia occurred in 29% of patients; 16% were Grade 3 hypoxia.Monitor oxygen saturation before initiation of and periodically throughout treatment. For decreased oxygen saturation with exercise (e.g., pulse oximeter &lt;88% or PaO2 ≤55 mm Hg), consider withholding WELIREG until pulse oximetry with exercise is greater than 88%, then resume at the same or a reduced dose. For decreased oxygen saturation at rest (e.g., pulse oximeter &lt;88% or PaO2 ≤55 mm Hg) or when urgent intervention is indicated, withhold WELIREG until resolved and resume at a reduced dose or discontinue. For life-threatening or recurrent symptomatic hypoxia, permanently discontinue WELIREG. Advise patients to report signs and symptoms of hypoxia immediately to a healthcare provider.Embryo-Fetal ToxicityBased on findings in animals, WELIREG can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman.Advise pregnant women and females of reproductive potential of the potential risk to the fetus. Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective non-hormonal contraception during treatment with WELIREG and for 1 week after the last dose. WELIREG can render some hormonal contraceptives ineffective. Advise male patients with female partners of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with WELIREG and for 1 week after the last dose.Adverse ReactionsIn Study 004, serious adverse reactions occurred in 15% of patients, including anemia, hypoxia, anaphylaxis reaction, retinal detachment, and central retinal vein occlusion (1 patient each).WELIREG was permanently discontinued due to adverse reactions in 3.3% of patients for dizziness and opioid overdose (1.6% each).Dosage interruptions due to an adverse reaction occurred in 39% of patients. Those which required dosage interruption in &gt;2% of patients were fatigue, decreased hemoglobin, anemia, nausea, abdominal pain, headache, and influenza-like illness.Dose reductions due to an adverse reaction occurred in 13% of patients. The most frequently reported adverse reaction which required dose reduction was fatigue (7%).The most common adverse reactions (≥25%) were decreased hemoglobin (93%), anemia (90%), fatigue (64%), increased creatinine (64%), headache (39%), dizziness (38%), increased glucose (34%), and nausea (31%).In Study 001, a clinical trial in patients with advanced solid tumors (n=58) treated at the recommended dose, the following additional adverse reactions have been reported: edema, cough, musculoskeletal pain, vomiting, diarrhea, and dehydration.Drug InteractionsCoadministration of WELIREG with inhibitors of UGT2B17 or CYP2C19 increases plasma exposure of belzutifan, which may increase the incidence and severity of adverse reactions. Monitor for anemia and hypoxia and reduce the dosage of WELIREG as recommended.Coadministration of WELIREG with CYP3A4 substrates decreases concentrations of CYP3A4 substrates, which may reduce the efficacy of these substrates or lead to therapeutic failures. Avoid coadministration with sensitive CYP3A4 substrates. If coadministration cannot be avoided, increase the sensitive CYP3A4 substrate dosage in accordance with its Prescribing Information. Coadministration of WELIREG with hormonal contraceptives may lead to contraceptive failure or an increase in breakthrough bleeding.LactationBecause of the potential for serious adverse reactions in breastfed children, advise women not to breastfeed during treatment with WELIREG and for 1 week after the last dose.Females and Males of Reproductive PotentialWELIREG can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Verify the pregnancy status of females of reproductive potential prior to initiating treatment with WELIREG.Use of WELIREG may reduce the efficacy of hormonal contraceptives. Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective non-hormonal contraception during treatment with WELIREG and for 1 week after the last dose. Advise males with female partners of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with WELIREG and for 1 week after the last dose.Based on findings in animals, WELIREG may impair fertility in males and females of reproductive potential and the reversibility of this effect is unknown.Pediatric UseSafety and effectiveness of WELIREG in pediatric patients under 18 years of age have not been established.Please see Prescribing Information, including information for the Boxed Warning about embryo-fetal toxicity, for WELIREG (belzutifan) at https://www.merck.com/product/usa/pi_circulars/w/welireg/welireg_pi.pdf and Medication Guide for WELIREG at https://www.merck.com/product/usa/pi_circulars/w/welireg/welireg_mg.pdf.About the Merck and Eisai strategic collaborationIn March 2018, Eisai and Merck, known as MSD outside the United States and Canada, through an affiliate, entered into a strategic collaboration for the worldwide co-development and co-commercialization of LENVIMA.

In a report dated May 12, 2023, ISS noted that Icahn's associates – Jesse Lynn, Andrew Teno, and Vincent Intrieri – ""are largely interchangeable,"" further stating that Icahn ""is seeking to replace the company's Chairman, CEO, and longest-tenured director with a three-member slate that is relatively homogenous. All three are investment professionals who work or worked for Icahn for years.""Illumina is pleased that ISS recognizes the strength of Illumina's Board and supports its best-in-class governance practices. ISS's recommendation that shareholders reject two of Icahn's associates is recognition that Illumina has the right skill sets and experiences on its Board to advance the company's strategic goals for value creation.Story continuesIt's also important for Illumina shareholders to know that Carl Icahn's firm, Icahn Enterprises LP (NASDAQ: IEP), revealed on May 10, 2023, that the U.S. Attorney's office for the Southern District of New York has launched a federal investigation into the company's practices. Two of Icahn's nominees – Jesse Lynn, general counsel, and Andrew Teno, a senior portfolio manager – currently work at IEP, the entity being investigated by authorities.The federal investigation into governance matters and other issues was launched one day after a well-known analysis firm, Hindenburg Research, issued a lengthy and highly critical report that accused Carl Icahn's IEP of inflating valuations for IEP's less liquid and private assets, as well as using cash from new investors to pay dividends to existing investors. ""Such Ponzi-like economic structures are sustainable only to the extent that new money is willing to risk being the last one 'holding the bag,'"" the Hindenburg report concluded.Illumina holds itself to the highest standards of performance and value creation and is dedicated to executing its innovation roadmap to empower genomic breakthroughs. The company is laser-focused on taking the steps necessary to immediately and consistently improve performance on a number of critical dimensions – revenue growth, cost management, and innovation – and will regularly engage with shareholders to provide updates on progress on these measures. Illumina recently committed to higher margins in 2024 and 2025 and announced plans to reduce annualized run rate costs by more than $100 million starting later this year. Conversely, to date Icahn has not offered anything resembling a strategy to improve performance.Illumina's Board of Directors requests that shareholders protect the value of their investment and future of the company by voting the WHITE proxy card today FOR all nine of the company's highly qualified director nominees and not for Carl Icahn's unfit three associates. The Annual Meeting will be held on May 25, 2023, at 10:00 am Pacific Time (1:00 pm Eastern Time). Shareholders of record as of close of business on April 3, 2023, are entitled to vote at the meeting, no matter how many or how few shares they own.The full text of the letter follows:VOTE USING THE WHITE PROXY CARD TODAY IN SUPPORT OF ILLUMINA'S NINE HIGHLY QUALIFIED DIRECTORSMay 15, 2023Dear Shareholder,This is a critical time for your investment in Illumina. We are quickly approaching our 2023 Annual Meeting, scheduled for May 25, 2023, at 10:00 am Pacific Time (1:00 pm Eastern Time), and we need your vote in support of Illumina. Please vote the WHITE proxy card today FOR all nine of the company's highly qualified director nominees.Investor Carl Icahn has been campaigning to replace our deeply experienced Board nominees Francis deSouza, CEO, Robert Epstein, MD, and John Thompson, Chair of the Board, with three of his unfit associates. Illumina's Board does not endorse Carl Icahn and believes the election of his three associates would detract from Illumina's long-term strategy. Icahn's nominees bring NO additive skills, NO relevant industry experience, and NO independence from Icahn. Icahn's attempt to position his associates as street-smart financial experts is, like most of his campaign, nonsensical. His nominees have no successful operating experience in senior management roles, unlike many of Illumina's directors (including those he is seeking to replace).To that end, Institutional Shareholder Services (""ISS""), a leading independent proxy voting and corporate governance advisory firm, has recommended Illumina shareholders vote FOR eight of Illumina's highly qualified director nominees. In a report dated May 12, 2023, ISS noted that Icahn's associates – Jesse Lynn, Andrew Teno, and Vincent Intrieri – ""are largely interchangeable,"" further stating that Icahn ""is seeking to replace the company's Chairman, CEO, and longest-tenured director with a three-member slate that is relatively homogenous. All three are investment professionals who work or worked for Icahn for years.""Illumina is pleased that ISS recognizes the strength of Illumina's Board and supports its best-in-class governance practices.

""Such Ponzi-like economic structures are sustainable only to the extent that new money is willing to risk being the last one 'holding the bag,'"" the Hindenburg report concluded.Illumina's Board is highly qualified with deep industry experience and expertiseOur nominees bring extensive and diverse business, financial, operating, regulatory and scientific backgrounds in the life sciences and technology sectors, and have presided over the growth of biotech companies, run public life sciences and technology companies, and brought world-class products to market. The three Illumina nominees that Icahn has decided to target far outmatch Icahn's own slate in skills and expertise.Illumina has laid out strategies to create additional value by improving both the top and bottom lineIllumina holds itself to the highest standards of performance and value creation and is dedicated to executing its innovation roadmap to empower genomic breakthroughs. The company is laser-focused on taking the steps necessary to immediately and consistently improve performance on a number of critical dimensions – revenue growth, cost management, and innovation – and will regularly engage with shareholders to provide updates on progress on these measures. Illumina recently committed to higher margins in 2024 and 2025 and announced plans to reduce annualized run rate costs by more than $100 million starting later this year. Conversely, to date Icahn has not offered anything resembling a strategy to improve performance.To further advance the company's strategic goals for value creation, Illumina has an ongoing Board refreshment process and has developed profiles for two new directors, based on the skills that would help Illumina achieve its strategic objectives over the next five years and beyond. This rigorous process began by evaluating more than 85 candidates, and culminated with the selection of two finalists. The Board did not complete its evaluation prior to the relevant deadlines for the Annual Meeting, and anticipates that the process will continue after the Annual Meeting.Illumina's director nominees bring deep commercial, scientific and business experience from leading organizations including Microsoft, Symantec, and Medco-UBCIllumina firmly believes that it has the right team and strategy in place to deliver long-term sustainable value for shareholders. Carl Icahn is determined to replace three experienced, proven, and vetted company nominees with objectively weaker ones. Icahn's increasingly desperate claims – diversions woven from nonsense ideas he presents as facts – are intended to distract from basic truth that he and his nominees possess no actionable plan for Illumina.FRANCIS DESOUZA, ILLUMINA CEO10 years of experience in the genomics industrySignificantly expanded Illumina's commercial footprint, achieving an 11% CAGR in revenue over the last five years and growing revenue from $2.2 billion to $4.6 billion since becoming CEO in 2016Founded two successful technology startupsHistory of successfully developing and commercializing new technologies from incubation stageMore than a decade of senior-level roles at Microsoft and SymantecROBERT EPSTEIN, MD35 years of experience in diagnostic and biopharmaceutical reimbursement, both as a developer of evidence and as a payorUnderstands the risks and opportunities associated with operating in markets regulated by the FDA and other global regulatory bodiesCurrent independent chair at Veracyte, director at Fate Therapeutics, and CEO of Epstein Health LLCPrevious Chief Medical Officer of Medco-UBC, overseeing acquisitions in the healthcare and life science services spacesJOHN THOMPSON, CHAIR OF THE BOARDMore than 40 years of experience leading companies through periods of transformative growth and value creationCurrent director at Microsoft; as previous chair and lead independent director, led the appointment of Satya Nadella as CEODuring Microsoft tenure, the company delivered a total shareholder return (TSR) of 885%In 10 year tenure as CEO at Symantec, grew revenue from $600 million to $6 billion and delivered a TSR of 819%At Symantec, ranked by Harvard Business Review as one of The Best-Performing CEOs in the WorldIcahn's nominees are not right for Illumina's BoardCarl Icahn's associates – Jesse Lynn, Andrew Teno, and Vincent Intrieri – are all current or former employees of Icahn who ""answer to"" him, in Icahn's own words.1 They are NOT independent, will NOT act in the best interest of Illumina's shareholders, and have NO expertise in Illumina's core business.

France previously tried to convince Musk to build his European gigafactory in the country, but he chose Germany.Asked by BFM TV about possible investments by Musk, Le Maire said only ""all investments that are being made today are the result of months or even years of negotiations"".Tesla was not immediately available for comment.PALATIAL BACKDROPOver the last five years, Macron has invited top CEOs to the opulent Versailles Palace to try to secure billions in foreign investments.For the former investment banker, who cannot stand again in elections due in 2027 after two terms but is looking to his legacy, the summit offers a chance to move on from months of protests and strikes against his plans to raise the retirement age by two years to 64.He is also competing on a global stage for investment in green technology when the United States has become a magnet following the introduction of its Inflation Reduction Act.Story continuesFrance so far expects a total of 28 investment projects from companies ranging from U.S. pharmaceutical group Pfizer to Swedish furniture maker IKEA and investment bank Morgan Stanley. In total, the projects are expected to create 8,000 jobs.The single biggest investment is a 5.2 billion euro project from a Taiwanese car battery maker in the northern port city of Dunkirk, which Macron announced on Friday.It is followed by a 1.5 billion euro battery components plant also in Dunkirk in a joint venture between Chinese group XTC and French firm Orano.IKEA has plans to invest 906 million euros by 2026 while Pfizer has budgeted 500 million euros to expand in France over the same period followed by British rival GSK with 400 million euros, Macron's office said.Morgan Stanley is expected to announce the creation of 200 new banking jobs in Paris.($1 = 0.9084 euros) (Reporting by Leigh Thomas, Tassilo Hummel, Blandine Henault, Sudip Kar-Gupta and Michel Rose, Editing by Christina Fincher and Barbara Lewis)]"

The book follows the Modern Warriors franchise debut title ""Modern Warriors: Real Stories from Real Heroes"" authored by FOX &amp; Friends Weekend co-host and veteran Pete Hegseth, which was a New York Times bestseller.In commenting on the announcement, Jones remarked, ""For years people have asked me to write a book about ‘my story.’ However, I’ve always known all along that the most important part of my story is the amazing collection of people and warriors who’ve become a part of my life. Each of them with inspiring and heroic stories of their own. It’s fitting that my first book is a telling of their stories, how they’ve affected my life and how their experience in serving this country shows the need for bonds on and beyond the battlefield. Unbroken Bonds is a book for, by and about patriotic Americans and what it truly means to be your brothers’ keeper.""""Unbroken Bonds of Battle"" marks the second installment of the growing Modern Warriors franchise, which spotlights those who have dedicated their lives to protecting the freedoms and the people of the United States of America. Staff Sergeant Jones served eight years in the Marine Corps with tours in Iraq and Afghanistan before an IED ended his career as a bomb technician, forever changing his life. Through the support of his brothers and sisters in arms, he began the arduous recovery and has since dedicated himself to paying it forward, working on behalf and with veterans for more than a decade. Featuring unfiltered and authentic conversations from across all branches of the military, Jones honors the true American heroes that not only defend this great nation, but protect their fellow warriors. With powerful lessons woven throughout these personal oral histories, along with a scrapbook of candid photos and an exploration of life, loss and even hunting, ""Unbroken Bonds of Battle"" will serve as a patriotic tribute to the tightknit community bonds built upon of faith, family and service.Story continuesSince the installment of FOX News Books, the publishing imprint has sold nearly 2 million copies, with each title placing on numerous national bestseller lists. The imprint launched in November 2020 with Hegseth’s ""Modern Warriors: Real Stories from Real Heroes,"" followed by Shannon Bream’s ""The Women of the Bible Speak"" (March 2021), ""All American Christmas"" by Rachel Campos-Duffy and Sean Duffy (November 2021), ""The Mothers and Daughters of the Bible Speak"" (March 2022), ""Faith Still Move Mountains"" by Harris Faulkner (October 2022) and most recently, ""The Love Stories of the Bible Speak"" (March 2023). Notably, every single FOX News Books title has made the New York Times bestsellers list, with Bream’s highly successful biblical ""Speak"" series, selling more than 1 million copies since launching in March 2021.A FOX News Media contributor since 2019, Jones provides military and political analysis across all platforms including FOX News Channel, FOX Business Network (FBN), FOX News Audio and FOX Nation. He frequently serves as a co-host for FNC’s weekend programming, including The Big Saturday and The Big Sunday Show, as well as a substitute hosts across daytime and primetime programming.

While there are more than 24,000 cryptocurrencies in the world, Bitcoin dominates the industry by having a share of 46% of the market capitalization. Meanwhile, the top 10 cryptocurrencies take up over 85% of the total market capitalization. According to Statista, the cryptocurrency industry is forecasted to generate a total revenue of $37.87 billion in 2023. The topline is expected to compound at an annual rate of 14.40% by 2027 to reach a total sum of $64.87 billion. As of 2023, the number of cryptocurrency users stands at 673 million globally, and this is expected to rise to 994.3 million by 2027.Binance, a leading cryptocurrency exchange, has been known for maintaining its dominance over other popular cryptocurrency exchanges. However, after implementing a recent policy change that discontinued zero-fee trading, Binance experienced a significant decline in its dominance in the spot trading market. Data provided by reputable analytics firm Kaiko revealed that Binance's share of spot trading declined from 73% to 51% following the policy alteration. As of May 6, the data indicates that Binance's reduced market share has benefited exchanges based in Asia, such as Huobi and OKX. These exchanges have gained 8% and 4% in trading volume, respectively. Additionally, South Korean exchanges saw substantial growth, collectively increasing their market share from 8% to 14%. This shift in the competitive landscape of the cryptocurrency market is significant and has caused many to reassess their strategies.One of the major trends in the cryptocurrency industry is its adoption by institutions like banks, hedge funds, and corporations. This has resulted in an influx of capital into the industry, which has contributed to the growth of the market. US financial services firms are actively developing their own blockchain-based platforms, which include digital currencies, to facilitate business-to-business (B2B) cryptocurrency transactions. In October 2020, PayPal Holdings Inc (NASDAQ:PYPL) unveiled its initiative enabling customers to purchase, sell, and hold Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies through their PayPal accounts. This integration allowed customers to utilize their cryptocurrency assets for purchases from the vast network of 26 million PayPal Holdings Inc's (NASDAQ:PYPL) merchants. Similarly, companies like Mastercard Inc (NYSE:MA) and Visa Inc (NYSE:V) have also forged relationships with crypto exchanges like Gemini and Binance to issue crypto-linked payment cards.Story continuesAt the same time, regulatory scrutiny on the digital currency industry has intensified following the downfall of FTX, a crypto exchange, in the previous year. In March, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission cautioned Coinbase, an American crypto exchange, regarding potential violations of securities laws. In response, Coinbase's CEO, Brian Armstrong, stated that the company is bracing itself for a protracted legal dispute with the SEC. Similarly, the Commodity Futures and Trading Commission accused Binance, a crypto exchange, of contravening trading regulations in March. These instances act as a reminder of the constantly changing environment and the necessity for cryptocurrency exchanges to adhere to regulatory guidelines.Best Cryptocurrency Exchanges and Apps in May 2023bitcoin mining Our MethodologyWe used a consensus opinion-based methodology to shortlist the best cryptocurrency exchanges and apps in May 2023. We evaluated these platforms based on ten key factors, such as security, reputation, fees, user interface, trading volume, supported cryptocurrencies, customer support, deposit and withdrawal terms, regulatory compliance, and the quality of mobile applications.

See for yourself by starting a 7-day free trial.Alphabet takes the AI gloves offArtificial intelligence capabilities are being integrated into Google search, Gmail, and Google Photos, said Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) (NASDAQ:GOOG) this past week at its annual I/O conference. The announcement comes in the aftermath of Microsoft's (NASDAQ:MSFT) headline-making venture into AI with that company's $10 billion investment in ChatGPT and its integration into the tech giant's Bing search product.The new Google search product, dubbed Search Generative Experience, would be able to verbally answer search queries alongside producing relevant links, and will be available via waitlist for U.S. customers over the coming weeks.Analysts were positive on the prospects for Alphabet here. Goldman Sachs said that it is...increasingly constructive on Alphabet's long-term strategic positioning in a number of key end markets and continue to see the company as the leading collection of AI/machine learning-driven businesses in our coverage universe.Jefferies wrote, regarding Alphabet's generative AI strategy: ""We see momentum accelerating, and monetization before year-end."" And Evercore ISI said Google has taken the AI gloves off and ""reminded everyone of how long it has been investing in, developing, and deploying AI capabilities across all of its offerings.""Alphabet shares gained 4% during the Wednesday session, when the conference took place, and were up nearly 12% for the week.PayPal slides as analyst says it 'may be stuck'PayPal (NASDAQ:PYPL) raised its full-year profit guidance, and first-quarter results topped expectations, but shares slumped on a lowered operating-margin outlook - from +125bps to +100bps - for the full year.Story continuesQ1 earnings were $1.17 per share, better than the $1.10 average expectation, driven by cost cuts and an increase in new accounts. And sales of $7.04B edged past the consensus.Looking ahead, the company now expects to grow adjusted EPS by about 20% to $4.95 - up from prior guidance of 18% growth to $4.87.Still, at least three analysts downgraded the stock, as InvestingPro subscribers found out first: Credit Suisse to Neutral from Outperform; Edward Jones to Hold from Buy, and Exane BNP Paribas (OTC:BNPQY) to Neutral from Outperform.Credit Suisse said in a note:Given the prospects for continued transaction margin pressures throughout 2023 (partly mix driven), PayPal’s vertical skew (discretionary) in an uncertain macro backdrop, a pending management transition, and increasing competitive pressures (longer term), we find it challenging to recommend the shares at this time.And Oppenheimer believes PayPal stock ""may be stuck"" in the near term.PayPal shares crashed more than 18% for the week.Airbnb warns of slowing growthAirbnb (NASDAQ:ABNB) said it made $0.18 a share - a swing from last year's loss but also $0.02 shy of Street expectations - on in-line revenue of $1.8B. The company also announced a new share buyback program of up to $2.5B.Looking ahead to Q2, the company guided revenue in a range of $2.35B to $2.45B, in line with Wall Street estimates, but also said Night and Experiences Booked ""will have unfavorable year-over-year comparisons in Q2 2023 as we overlap pent-up 2022 demand following the COVID Omicron variant.""After that, the shares took a quick fall. Morgan Stanley cut the price target to $95 per share and reiterated an Underweight rating on ABNB stock, as InvestingPro reported in real time:Slower-than-expected forward room night growth (US facing pricing and supply constraints) speak to how forward growth (more reliant on Europe, APAC, LATAM and new business opportunities) could face higher execution risk. Competitive risk (share loss to BKNG) also continues.Oppenheimer believes that the velocity of 2Q23 nights deceleration will heighten concerns about slowing growth:We maintain Perform on uncertain back-half outlook and premium valuation, 21x '23E EBITDA vs. BKNG's 15x, limiting NT upside to shares.Shares tumbled more than 14% for the week.Twilio slides on deflated outlookTwilio (NYSE:TWLO) offered a soft Q2 revenue outlook, saying it expects EPS in the range of $0.27-$0.31, compared with the Wall Street consensus of $0.29. Revenue is seen at $980 million to $990M, missing the consensus estimate of $1.05B.Q1 EPS of $0.47 and revenue of $1.01 billion came in better than anticipated, but Q2 guidance disappointed investors.For the full year, the company expects non-GAAP income from operations in the range of $275M-$350M.Oppenheimer cut the stock's price target to $75, citing continued headwinds for Twilio. However, the analyst remains Buy-rated, saying, ""the risk/reward is positively skewed.""Bernstein also cut the stock's price target, going to $58:At this point we remain on the sidelines while waiting for more clarity on the rebound and future.Shares lost more than 14% for the week to $45.83.ZscalerZscaler (NASDAQ:ZS) shares surged more than 20% Monday after the company's preliminary Q3 results beat expectations: Its top line should be between $415M and $419M, well above the previous guidance range of $396 million to $398 million.In addition, the company's adjusted income from operations is far higher, now estimated to range between $60M and $64M.CEO Jay Chaudhry said the company ""had a strong finish to the quarter"" thanks to high ROI from its Zscaler Zero Trust Exchange platform.The cloud security company also now expects full-year revenue to range between $1.587B and $1.591B, above the previously forecast range of $1.558 billion to $1.563 billion.On the heels of that news, CFRA upped the stock to Strong Buy from Buy.

These enterprises command 25 years of consecutive dividend increases, offering a steady hand during troubled times.Fundamentally, one of the reasons why the best dividend aristocrats for long-term investors should appeal much more strongly now than before centers on their underlying resilience. Passive income must come from somewhere. Therefore, entities that consistently generate earnings should weather storms much better than those that don’t. Also, dividend aristocrats with high yield and growth potential offer a two-fer: they provide critical passive income while also facilitating upside return potential.HRLHormel Foods$40.22AMCRAmcor$10.36AFLAFLAC$66.46MCDMcDonald’s$295.67ATOAtmos Energy$118.75IBMIBM.$121.93XOMExxon Mobil$107.65InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsHormel Foods (HRL)stock market ticker screen with the word ""dividends"" appearing in large text.Source: iQoncept/shutterstock.comAn American food processing company founded in 1891, Hormel Foods (NYSE:HRL) makes an easy case for dividend aristocrats to buy and hold. With such a long and storied history, HRL isn’t just your run-of-the-mill passive income provider. No, with 57 years of consecutive dividend increases under its belt, Hormel represents one of the dividend kings.Fundamentally, Hormel offers predictability. Obviously, humans require a baseline minimum calorie intake. Therefore, investors can depend on the company to steadily deliver the goods. Also, its three-year revenue growth rate comes in at 9.2%, above 64.09% of its competitors. Therefore, it’s one of the best dividend aristocrats for long-term investors. Also, the company enjoys decent stability in the balance sheet. In particular, its Altman Z-Score comes in at 4.59, indicating low bankruptcy risk.Currently, Hormel’s forward yield is 2.74%, which is decent. Plus, it’s noticeably higher than the consumer staple sector’s average yield of 1.89%. Also, its payout ratio is 58.63%, which is “doable” in terms of sustainability.Story continuesAmcor (AMCR)A photo of a paper with a chart and the word ""Dividends"" written on it, with a pen and calculator resting on top of it.Source: jittawit21/Shutterstock.comA global packaging company, Amcor (NYSE:AMCR) develops and produces flexible packaging, rigid containers, specialty cartons, closures, and services for food, beverage, pharmaceutical, medical-device, home, and personal care, among other product categories. While relevant, AMCR hasn’t enjoyed an auspicious start this year, shedding almost 14% since the January opener. Still, for patient investors, AMCR could be one of the dividend aristocrats to buy and hold.Financially, Amcor isn’t particularly remarkable. For example, its three-year revenue growth rate pings at 6.3%, above 53.26% of its competitors. However, the company does enjoy business predictability, facilitating consistent annual profitability. Plus, its trailing-year net margin is 6.54%, above 71.35% of sector players.Enticingly, Amcor carries a forward yield of 4.75%. Moreover, it commands 40 years of consecutive dividend increases. With a decade to go before becoming a king of passive income, AMCR rates as one of the top dividend aristocrats to buy now.AFLAC (AFL)A hand reaches out of a mailbox holding a wad of cash.Source: ShutterstockWhile not the most exciting name in the capital markets, AFLAC (NYSE:AFL) deserves closer inspection thanks to its relevancy. Specializing in supplemental insurance, Aflac covers the gaps that traditional insurance programs miss. With all that’s transpired in the ugly Covid-19 pandemic, households may be better attuned to seeking financial protection. Therefore, AFL makes a case for dividend aristocrats to buy and hold.Similar to Amcor above, Aflac doesn’t deliver particularly standout financial metrics. To be honest, its 0.9% three-year revenue growth rate is very ho-hum. At the same time, insurance companies suffered badly during the crisis. On a positive note, AFL trades at only 9.71 times trailing earnings, which is decently undervalued.Turning to passive income, Aflac’s forward yield comes out to 2.49%. Though not the most generous yield, the company commands 40 years of consecutive annual dividend increases. As well, its payout ratio sits at 27.52%, presenting high sustainability confidence. If you just want to get through the current mess reliably, AFL deserves to be on your list of best dividend aristocrats for long-term investors.McDonald’s (MCD)Source: ShutterstockA fast-food icon and a symbol of American capitalism, McDonald’s (NYSE:MCD) intrigues for myriad reasons. On the fundamental front, the Golden Arches benefits from the trade-down effect. Essentially, it’s practically impossible for most households to be complete luddites regarding eating out, even during economic hardships. Fortunately, McDonald’s provides good eating – or so InvestorPlace’s Will Ashworth claims – and low prices.Financially, the company holds its own though it’s not remarkable across the board. Its three-year revenue growth rate pings at 3.8%, which outpaces 71.17% of the restaurant industry. Also, it’s consistently profitable, which is what you want to see with your dividend aristocrats to buy and hold. Right now, its trailing-year net margin stands at 29.36%, above 96.54% of sector players.For passive income, the fast-food king is almost a dividend king, commanding 46 years of consecutive annual increases. To be fair, its forward yield is modest at 2.05%. Nevertheless, it does beat the consumer discretionary sector’s average yield of 1.89.%Atmos Energy (ATO)sheet of paper marked ""dividends"" with a $20 bill on top of it to represent dividend stocksSource: ShutterstockHeadquartered in Dallas, Texas, Atmos Energy (NYSE:ATO) is one of the nation’s largest natural gas-only distributors. Per its public profile, Atmos serves about three million natural gas distribution customers in over 1,400 communities in nine states. Atmos Energy also manages company-owned natural gas pipeline and storage assets, including one of the largest intrastate natural gas pipeline systems in Texas.Since the start of the year, ATO gained almost 7% of its equity value. Financially, the company again doesn’t have an outstandingly distinct profile. For example, its three-year revenue growth rate of 7.2% is just a bit below average. On the other hand, the company’s net margin is 18.18%, above 83.16% of competitors. And it’s consistently profitable.Another strong example of a dividend aristocrat to buy and hold, Atmos commands 39 years of consecutive dividend increases. Its payout ratio is relatively low too at 46.27%. About the only drawback is that it’s not the most generous at a forward yield of 2.5%. Still, Wall Street analysts peg ATO as a consensus strong buy. Therefore, it ranks as one of the top dividend aristocrats to buy now.IBM (IBM)The word ""dividend"" highlighted in a dictionary.Source: ShutterstockLong derided as a fading legacy technology outfit, IBM (NYSE:IBM) has made a concerted effort to regain its mojo. Arguably, it’s done just that, focusing on leadership positions in burgeoning fields such as the hybrid cloud. It also experiments with other compelling innovations such as artificial intelligence and the blockchain. Being a generous provider of passive income, “Big Blue” is one of the dividend aristocrats to buy and hold.What I like about IBM is its forward-looking potential. No, it’s clearly not a growth machine in the strictest sense of the term. However, in 2022, the company posted revenue of $60.53 billion, up 5.54% from 2021’s tally of $57,351. That’s not bad at all for an enterprise that started off in June 1911. Back then, William Howard Taft was the President of the U.S.For passive income, IBM carries a forward yield of 5.48%, well above the tech sector’s average yield of 1.37%. It also features 30 years of consecutive dividend increases. From a contextual standpoint, IBM ranks among the dividend aristocrats with high yield and growth.Exxon Mobil (XOM)dividend stocksSource: ShutterstockWhile the rise of electric vehicles seemingly makes hydrocarbon specialists obsolete, such a complete transition might not happen for a very long time (if ever). Therefore, investors can trust Exxon Mobil (NYSE:XOM), which ranks among the dividend aristocrats to buy and hold. Plus, with international factors potentially catalyzing XOM, it’s one of the top enterprises to watch.Financially, the company recovered well from the Covid-19 disaster. On the top line, Exxon’s three-year revenue growth rate stands at 15.9%, above 65.02% of the field. Also, its EBITDA growth rate during the same period is 37%, above 72.26% of sector peers.Enticingly, Exxon carries a forward yield of 3.34%. Though not the highest yield in the energy sector, it’s one of the more reliable with a payout ratio of 37.57%. Also, it commands 40 years of consecutive annual dividend increases, a status it will not give up without a fight. Overall, analysts peg XOM as a moderate buy with a price target of $130.54, implying nearly 20% upside potential. Thus, it’s one of the dividend aristocrats with high yield and growth.On the date of publication, Josh Enomoto did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.A former senior business analyst for Sony Electronics, Josh Enomoto has helped broker major contracts with Fortune Global 500 companies.

Some of these companies have been around for nearly 100 years and are well-known household names. In their heyday, they led technological advances that transformed our lives and pushed society into the future. From personal computers and software applications to microchips and wireless internet. However, now that they are mature, established, and entrenched, many of these once-leading names have fallen out of favor with investors who are preoccupied with the new, shiny thing in tech. This is a shame as many legacy tech companies continue to be great businesses. It wouldn’t take much for their stocks to turn around and rise again. Here are seven legacy tech stocks primed for a comeback.ORCLOracle$96.55TXNTexas Instruments$161.18AMTAmerican Tower$195.63IBMIBM.$121.17TAT&amp;T$16.92HPQHP. Inc.$29.54INTCIntel$29.56Oracle (ORCL)Tech stocks: Double exposure of man's hands holding and using a phone and financial graph drawing.Source: Peshkova / ShutterstockLet’s begin with Oracle (NYSE:ORCL). Co-founded in 1977 by Larry Ellison, Oracle is a software company whose products help companies manage their human resources departments and supply chains, as well as other areas of their business. The company may have gotten a little long in the tooth, but it remains the third biggest software company in the world with annual revenues of more than $40 billion. Additionally, Oracle continues to issue strong earnings reports.Yet, the stock does not get as much love from investors as competing software concerns. So far in 2023, ORCL stock has gained 15%, which is half the 30% advance seen in shares of Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT). Long-term, Oracle’s stock performance appears better, with the share price doubling over the past five years. More recently, the stock has struggled a bit due to Wall Street’s negative views of its $28 billion acquisition of electronic medical records company Cerner. However, it may not be long before Oracle’s stock has a big breakout.Story continuesInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsTexas Instruments (TXN)A concept image of robot hands with stock information in between themSource: Blue Planet Studio / ShutterstockMany people still think about calculators when they hear the name Texas Instruments (NASDAQ:TXN). And for good reason. Calculators were the company’s bread-and-butter for much of its 93-year history. However, Texas Instruments today has gone well beyond the calculators it sells to middle and high school students. The company is now a major manufacturer of semiconductors and integrated circuits. In fact, Texas Instruments is one of the top 10 semiconductor concerns in the world.With more than 30,000 employees worldwide and annual revenues north of $20 billion, Texas Instruments is a formidable technology company. It also has more than 45,000 patents to its name and is a major holder of intellectual property rights. Yet TXN stock continues to drift sideways for the most part. In the last 12 months, the stock has declined 2%. While the stock has risen 50% in the past five years, it continues to trail other tech names.In addition, TXN stock offers a robust quarterly dividend that pays $1.24 a share for a yield of 3.05%. The shares look undervalued with a price-earnings ratio of 18. Most tech stocks the size of Texas Instruments trade at 25 times future earnings, or more, and offer no dividend payout.American Tower (AMT)Close up of phone with creative forex chart on blue background. Trade, finance, technology and communication concept. 3D Rendering. Tech Stocks to Buy Before the Bull Market ReturnsSource: Golden Dayz / Shutterstock.comAmerican Tower (NYSE:AMT) is technically a real estate investment trust. However, it is also a major technology company given that it owns the largest portfolio of wireless Internet towers in the U.S. American Tower is now adapting its infrastructure and towers to handle fifth-generation (5G) wireless as demand for the most powerful Internet skyrockets across the U.S. In business since 1995, American Tower today has more than 6,000 employees and revenues of nearly $10 billion.Despite the essential nature of its business, AMT stock has struggled. The share price is down 16% over the past year, including a 10% pullback so far in 2023. Through five years, the share price has gained a tepid 39%. As with Texas Instruments, American Tower pays a strong quarterly dividend that yields 3.22% or $1.56 per share. So what’s holding the stock back? Analysts claim it is the slow adoption of 5G wireless outside the U.S. That and higher debt servicing costs due to rising interest rates are expected to grow by $315 million in 2023.IBM (IBM)Photo of IBM (IBM) building as seen through the canopy of a tree. IBM logo is in large letters on side of building.Source: shutterstock.com/LCVBig Blue could be the poster child for legacy technology companies. In continuous operation since 1911, investors would be hard-pressed to find an older technology stock. Yet International Business Machines Corp. (NYSE:IBM) has undergone quite a bit of restructuring in recent years in an effort to improve its financial and stock performance. Changes have included the spin-off of its managed infrastructure business into Kyndryl (NYSE:KD), and the repositioning of the core IBM business as a cloud computing firm.IBM also continues to focus on the development of supercomputers through its quantum computing division which is focused on both commercial and scientific applications. Interest in the company’s quantum capabilities is growing with the rise of artificial intelligence. Yet all the changes have not been enough to move the needle on IBM stock. The company’s share price is down 10% over the past 12 months, bringing its five-year decline to 12%. A renewed focus on AI might be just the thing to finally push IBM stock higher.AT&amp;T (T)Graphic of side view of virtual financial charts with tech aesthetic, symbolizing fintechSource: shutterstock.com/whiteMoccaAT&amp;T (NYSE:T) is another technology company that is a household name in the U.S. but has struggled to gain traction with investors in recent years. The legacy company, which was founded in 1983, recently reported abysmal quarterly results that caused its share price to plunge 10%, marking the biggest one-day drop in T stock since the technology bubble burst back in 2000. Poor subscriber numbers hurt AT&amp;T’s earnings and led to a big selloff in the shares.However, T stock has been on the downslope for many years. In the past five years, the company’s share price has declined 30%. Alternating business strategies in recent years have sowed confusion among investors. The company first prioritized diversification, then shed its non-core assets, including WarnerMedia, to focus on growing its wireless internet service. But now, AT&amp;T says high inflation and rising interest rates have made consumers reluctant to spend money on 5G wireless. The good news is that T stock may have finally bottomed.HP Inc.

In business since 1939 and formerly known as “Hewlett-Packard,” the home where HP was founded in Palo Alto, California, has been labeled a historical landmark and marked with a plaque that reads: “Birthplace of Silicon Valley.” Now that’s a legacy tech company! Today, HP is still involved in its core business of computer hardware and printers, though it is increasingly focused on cutting-edge 3D printers.HP stock is another one that has lagged behind its peers in recent years. Over the last 12 months, HPQ stock has slumped 18%. Its five-year gain is only 33%. Yet HP is another old tech company that pays a very attractive dividend to its stockholders. Currently, the dividend yield on HPQ stock is 3.47%, which is high for any stock but exceptional among tech securities. Also, HP’s shares look significantly undervalued trading at a P/E ratio of only 12. Again, most tech companies the size of HP trade at more than double that rate.Intel (INTC)An Army soldier using a laptop representing BBAI Stock.Source: Gorodenkoff / Shutterstock.comIf any legacy technology stock is due for a rebound, it is microchip and semiconductor company Intel (NASDAQ:INTC). The company has been struggling mightily as it moves to transform its business to fabricating chips and semiconductors for other companies. Intel is spending more than $20 billion to reposition its chip factories as foundries. The effort is seriously impacting the company’s bottom line, resulting in Intel reporting the biggest loss in its 55-year history for this year’s first quarter.Specifically, Intel announced a 133% annual reduction in its Q1 earnings per share and reported that its revenue in Q1 fell 36% from a year earlier to $11.7 billion. This year’s first quarter marked the fifth consecutive quarter of falling sales at Intel. Owing to its big investments aimed at a turnaround, and the poor earnings, INTC stock has declined 45% in the last five years, including a 32% decrease in the past 12 months. However, once the transition to manufacturing microchips is complete, Intel could end up being a winner.On the date of publication, Joel Baglole held a long position in MSFT.

One key reason is that momentum appears to be fading. For example, in the trailing one-month period, the index only gained slightly over 0.2%.Second, the distinct period following the Covid-19 pandemic where anything and everything seemingly shot higher is gone. And, in a time dominated by stubborn inflation, rising interest rates, and more recently bank failures, it’s survival of the fittest. Therefore, investors should focus on the best stocks for portfolio list for upside success. Each of the market ideas below features strong sales growth and have the bonus of being undervalued. So, without further ado, here are the top stock picks to consider.KLICKulicke and Soffa$47.02CECelanese$101.54BPBP.$36.64ALBAlbemarle$193.85MPCMarathon Petroleum$112.17SBSWSibanye Stillwater$8.20VIRVir Biotechnology$24.58InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsKulicke and Soffa (KLIC)An image of a street sign post with directions labeled ""Buy"", ""Hold"", and ""Sell""Source: PX Media / ShutterstockA lesser-known enterprise, Kulicke and Soffa (NASDAQ:KLIC) deserves our attention as one of the top-rated stocks to buy. A leading provider of semiconductor and electronic assembly solutions, Kulicke and Soffa undergirds several industries, including the global automotive, consumer electronics, and communications sectors, among others. Since the beginning of this year, KLIC gained more than 8% of its equity value.Fundamentally, what makes KLIC a viable candidate for the best stocks for the portfolio list is its operational prowess. According to investment resource Gurufocus, Kulicke’s three-year revenue growth rate comes out to 44.2%, blowing past 92.78% of companies listed in the semiconductor industry. As well, it enjoys a three-year book growth rate of 19.8%, above 68.58% of sector players.Notably, KLIC trades at 10.3 times free cash flow (FCF). As a discount to the metric, Kulicke ranks better than 77% of its peers. Finally, Wall Street analysts peg KLIC as a consensus moderate buy. Their average price target lands at $55, implying over 18% upside potential.Story continuesCelanese (CE)Man holding stacks of money. millionaire stocks.Source: Epic Cure / ShutterstockAn American technology and specialty materials firm, Celanese (NYSE:CE) garners attention for being the world’s leading producer of acetic acid. So far this year, CE prints a quietly positive performance, moving up over 2%. However, in the trailing one-year period, shares tumbled nearly 26%. Nevertheless, for the adventurous type, CE could be one of the top-rated stocks to buy.Going to my trusty guide Gurufocus, Celanese posts a three-year revenue growth rate of 20.6%. This stat swings above 81.36% of companies listed in the chemicals industry. Also, it prints a three-year EBITDA growth rate of 21.7%, above 70.68% of sector players. Just for good measure, its book growth rate during the same period is an impressive 35.3%. Also, CE makes for one of the top stock picks because of its value proposition. Right now, the market prices shares at a forward multiple of 8.49. As a discount to projected earnings, Celanese ranks better than 82.89% of the competition.Lastly, analysts peg CE as a consensus moderate buy. Their average price target comes out to $129.86, implying over 24% upside potential.BP (BP)A person draws a stock chart on a chalkboard.Source: Zurijeta / Shutterstock.comA British multinational oil and natural gas company, BP (NYSE:BP) is one of the hydrocarbon supermajors. It’s also one of the globe’s largest companies measured by revenues and profits. Since the start of this year, BP gained nearly 8% of its equity value. Further, in the past 365 days, shares returned stakeholders almost 24%. However, there may still be room for growth left, making it one of the top-rated stocks to buy.Per Gurufocus, BP’s three-year revenue growth rate comes in at 20.5%, above 74.69% of the oil and gas industry. Also, its FCF growth rate during the same period impresses at 47.7%. That’s above 80.79% of peers. As well, its trailing-year net margin stands at 10.27%, beating out 62.81% of rivals.Additionally, the market prices BP at a forward multiple of 6.07. As a discount to projected earnings, BP ranks better than 61.82% of the competition. To close out, analysts peg BP as a consensus strong buy. On average, their price target lands at $46.25, implying 25% upside potential. Thus, it’s worth considering for best-performing stocks.Albemarle (ALB)hands at desk near laptop computer, with one hand holding a pile of hundred dollar bills. Bank stocksSource: shutterstock.com/CC7While seemingly everybody loves expressing the (annoying) mantra that electric vehicles are the future of mobility, recent developments seem to threaten this aspiration for several enterprises. Specifically, the EV price war may drag down sector players until only the strongest survive. Fortunately, you can cut through the nonsense with lithium-provider Albemarle (NYSE:ALB). Given its infrastructural importance, it’s one of the top-rated stocks to buy.A high-flying performer, Albemarle’s three-year revenue growth rate pings at 22.6%, outflanking 84.27% of its peers. Also, its EBITDA growth rate during the same period is 45.7%, above 89.35% of the industry. Not to be outdone, its book growth rate in the past 36 months came out to 22.5%, above 80%. Attractively, the market prices ALB at a forward multiple of 8.58. As a discount to projected earnings, Albemarle ranks better than 86.18% of companies listed in the chemicals sector.Turning to Wall Street, analysts peg ALB as a consensus moderate buy. Overall, their price target hits $259.18, implying nearly 33% upside potential.Marathon Petroleum (MPC)tree growing on coin of stacking with green bokeh background; growth stocksSource: Freedom365day / Shutterstock.comAn American petroleum refining, marketing, and transportation company, Marathon Petroleum (NYSE:MPC) largely focuses on the downstream component of the hydrocarbon industry’s value chain, though it does offer midstream relevancy with its transportation unit. Since the Jan. opener, MPC is just a hair above parity. However, in the trailing year, it’s up 21%. Despite a less-than-encouraging performance in 2023, MPC ranks among the top-rated stocks to buy.Compared to the rest of the industry, Marathon stands out as a growth machine. Per Gurufocus, its three-year revenue growth rate pings at 27.1%, above 81.66% of the field. Also, its EBITDA growth rate during the same period impresses at 60.9%, above 89.12% of sector players.Notably, the market prices MPC at a forward multiple of 5.87, noticeably below the sector median stat of 7.1 times. In addition, shares trade at 3.52 times FCF. As a discount to the underlying metric, Marathon ranks better than 76.32% of the competition. Looking to the Street, analysts peg MPC as a consensus moderate buy. Their average price target stands at $148.20, implying almost 34% upside potential. Thus, it’s a worthy idea for top growth stocks.Sibanye Stillwater (SBSW)Stocks to buy: smartphone with the words ""buy"" and ""sell"" displayed on the screen. The user's finger is about to press buy. Stock charts are in the background of the image.Source: Chompoo Suriyo / Shutterstock.comFundamentally, the upside narrative for Sibanye Stillwater (NYSE:SBSW) centers on the steadily rising gold price. Obviously, as a precious metals miner, Sibanye would benefit from this dynamic, all other things being equal. However, an EBITDA miss for the first quarter cratered SBSW, making it incredibly risky. Still, if you’re a daring contrarian, SBSW could be an intriguing idea for top-rated stocks to buy.On paper, SBSW doesn’t seem like a viable candidate for the best stocks for the portfolio list. For instance, data from Gurufocus shows that 2022 revenue came in at just a bit over $8 billion. That’s conspicuously lower than the $10.84 billion posted in 2021. However, with the geopolitical flashpoint in Eastern Europe, several nations will be scouring for other valuable precious metals that have industrial uses beyond gold, such as palladium, platinum, and rhodium. These metals fall under Sibanye’s specialty, potentially making SBSW one of the top stock picks for gamblers.Lastly, analysts peg SBSW as a strong buy. On average, their price target stands at $12.53, implying almost 50% upside potential.Vir Biotechnology (VIR)a green button on a keyboard has an arrow pointing upward with the word ""Buy"". representing safe stocks to buySource: AdityaB. Photography/ShutterStock.comHeadquartered in San Francisco, California, Vir Biotechnology (NASDAQ:VIR) per its website focuses on combining immunologic insights with cutting-edge technologies to treat and prevent serious infectious diseases. Since the start of this year, VIR dipped almost 3%. However, the trailing-year performance looks much better, returning over 10% of equity value. For those that want to swing for the fences with their top-rated stocks to buy, VIR could be intriguing.Thanks to acquisitions and lucrative partnerships and contracts, Vir’s operational stats look extremely impressive. Obviously, the three-year revenue growth rate of nearly 700% isn’t going to last that long. However, its book growth rate during the same period impresses at 58.2%. As well, the company enjoys a solid balance sheet, with a cash-to-debt ratio of 18.77.Notably, VIR trades at 1.59 times tangible book value. In contrast, the sector median stat comes out to a much loftier 2.71 times. On a final note, analysts peg VIR as a consensus strong buy. Overall, their average price target stands at $49, implying 102% upside potential.On the date of publication, Josh Enomoto did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.A former senior business analyst for Sony Electronics, Josh Enomoto has helped broker major contracts with Fortune Global 500 companies.

Start your 7-day trial today.Tesla Breaks Ground on Lithium Refinery, Aims for 1M EVs by 2025Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) broke ground Monday on a new Texas lithium refinery, with which CEO Elon Musk aims to produce enough of the battery metal to build about 1 million vehicles by 2025. That would make it the largest lithium processor in North America. Tesla's pioneering approach distinguishes it as the only major automaker in the country that not only manufactures vehicles but also refines its own minerals, most notably lithium.Tesla is going to need the materials, as its Texas facility has reached a 5,000-unit weekly production rate for its Model Y, equating to roughly 260,000 vehicles annually, per a company announcement on Tuesday.With things heating up at Tesla, supporters of the brand worry that the multi-billionaire Musk is needed now more than ever. They may get their wish, as Musk announced Thursday that he is stepping down from his post at Twitter and will be devoting more time to Tesla.As always, InvestingPro subscribers got this news in rapid fire. Never be left in the dust again.Mixed Results for Emerging EV BrandsA number of emerging EV brands disclosed their Q1 results this week, and Fisker (NYSE:FSR) and Lucid (NASDAQ:LCID) unfortunately fell short of expectations on Tuesday.Fisker reported EPS of ($0.38), $0.08 worse than the analyst estimate of ($0.30), while Lucid reported a $0.04 miss of its own. The poor showing had U.S. EV shares trending downward early in the day, with FSR slumping 5.3% and LCID sliding 9% in early trading.Fisker followed the poor 1Q results by cutting production targets in the face of supply-chain constraints. Fisker now expects to produce between 32,000 and 36,000 units in 2023, compared with its previous target of 42,400 cars.Story continuesNikola (NASDAQ:NKLA) followed the trend, losing 9.3% Tuesday after the company reported a wider quarterly loss and said it would pause truck production. The company’s cash burn came in at $240 million as it produced 63 vehicles.""This level of cash burn is not sustainable for our business, and we are looking at every option for reductions in spending,"" Nikola finance chief Anastasiya Pasterick said.On Wednesday, Rivian (NASDAQ:RIVN) and Li Auto (NASDAQ:LI) impressed investors and industry analysts alike with their earnings releases, which InvestingPro subscribers got in real time.Rivian surpassed expectations with earnings per share of ($1.25), outperforming the consensus estimate of ($1.61) by $0.36. Similarly, Li Auto delivered strong results, reporting an EPS of RMB1.35, surpassing the analyst estimate of RMB0.34 by an impressive margin.LI’s performance earned it praise from several analysts, with Barclays writing that the company “has proven itself to be one of a few that has staying power.” And that the Chinese automaker “has clearly pulled away from the rest of the pack of emerging EV makers.""Following Rivian's successful first-quarter performance, the company's CEO, RJ Scaringe, appeared on CNBC's ""Squawk Box"" for an interview conducted at the company's manufacturing plant in Illinois.During the interview, Scaringe emphasized Rivian's commitment to scaling up production and hinted at potential partnerships beyond its existing collaboration with Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN).GM restructures to compete with longtime rivalAt its annual Fleet Solutions Summit Thursday, General Motors (NYSE:GM) announced the consolidation of its North American sales operations for commercial vehicles, parts, and telematics services under a new brand called GM Evolve.

Fearful customers withdrew deposits in droves. When the company revealed over $100 billion in withdrawals, it sealed First Republic’s fate.To protect depositors, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (“FDIC”) arranged for JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) to take First Republic over. It will undoubtedly benefit from the deal. The loss-share transaction will see the FDIC’s deposit insurance fund lose $13 billion. Because of the deal, the FDIC expects minimized disruptions for loan customers.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsJPM stock may gain from taking over First Republic, yet investors have seven other bank stocks that may fare better. The former may face closer government scrutiny as it manages First Republic’s assets. This would hamper its performance. Investors should instead look at bank stocks that benefit from First Republic’s failure.They offer more rewards over risks, especially when markets express excessive fears for the banking sector.GSGoldman Sachs$322.87MTBM&amp;T Bank$115.09 PNCPNC Financial$114.35TDToronto-Dominion Bank$61.48TFCTruist Financial$27.90WFCWells Fargo$38.45ZIONZions Bancorp$23.91Goldman Sachs (GS)In this photo illustration the Goldman Sachs Group (GS) logo displayed on a smartphone screen and a stock market graph in the backgroundSource: rafapress / Shutterstock.comGoldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) posted growth in assets under supervision in its first quarter to a record $2.67 trillion.The firm’s ability to attract assets suggests that it is among the best stocks to buy after First Republic’s failure.Goldman is undergoing a reset. It is working through deals that will add meaningfully to business growth. Look for aggressive mergers and acquisitions in the back half of this year. As bank valuations fall, Goldman Sachs may add companies that fit to its strategy. This includes its strategy of strengthening its leading global banking and markets franchise.Story continuesThe company is reducing its balance sheet density by $2.3 billion. It also includes reducing its principal investment portfolio to less than $15 billion by the end of 2024. That way, Goldman Sachs will have less exposure to the risk of falling asset values. Expect market headwinds to delay these deals. This will not hurt the firm’s commitment to grow its management fees.M&amp;T Bank (MTB)Piggy bank on a wooden table with stacks of coins next to it. Cryptos to BuySource: FabrikaSimf / ShutterstockM&amp;T Bank (NYSE:MTB) is indirectly one of the stock winners from the First Republic failure. In the last quarter, Darren J. King, Chief Financial Officer, said that the company has a strong, diversified community bank model. It managed the business prudently. As a result, M&amp;T Bank posted Q1 net income nearly doubling from last year.Investors need not worry about deposit losses. CFO Kig said that deposits did not change despite disruption in the overall market. In addition, commercial and wealth deposits both remain high.In the consumer space, depositors holding substitutes to take advantage of the rising rates. M&amp;T saw an increase in demand for money market savings and savings accounts.Skeptical investors thought that weaker deposit flows would gain momentum. Fortunately, the weaker demand balances are partly because of a seasonal pattern. Commercial customers need funds to pay taxes. In addition, they need to reduce their balance to align with their economic activities.PNC Financial (PNC)PNC bank logo on buildingSource: Jonathan Weiss/Shutterstock.comPNC Financial (NYSE:PNC) traded lower starting last month when it cut its revenue outlook. Investors ignored PNC posting revenue growing by nearly 20% to $5.6 billion. Deposits grew in the quarter.While PNC reported average deposits increased to $436.2 billion, up by 0.3%, markets worried about its outlook. The firm expects revenue between $21.96 billion and $22.18 billion. Revenue will grow by 4% to 5%, instead of an earlier forecast of 6^ to 8% Y/Y growth.Fearful depositors are decreasing their balance amounts. PNC is bucking this negative trend. The community bank expected that customers who accumulated stimulus money during Covid would draw that down. Looking ahead, PNC expects the Federal Reserve will keep rates higher for longer. It expects volatility in net interest income.Once the Fed indicates it will stop raising rates, PNC will revise its NII targets to the upside. Investors will buy PNC stock on the increased certainty.Toronto-Dominion Bank (TD)Illustration of the inside of a bank. Bank stocks.Source: YummyBuum / ShutterstockToronto-Dominion Bank (NYSE:TD) benefited immensely when regulators delayed its bid to buy First Horizon (NYSE:FHN). On May 4, both firms agreed to terminate the merger agreement.TD will make a $200 million cash payment to First Horizon. This adds to the $25 million fee reimbursement that was due from the merger agreement.TD is saving billions from the terminated deal. The Canadian bank will have more cash on hand, increasing its Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1) ratio. Investors will have higher confidence that the bank will absorb a financial shock. Expect investors to accumulate TD Bank stock, even though the stock gained from First Republic’s failure.TD may shop for other U.S. regional banks at a steep discount. The FDIC created a precedent of hurting the common and preferred stock prices of struggling banks. If it pauses its merger and acquisition strategy, TD may buy back shares instead.Truist Financial (TFC)Smartphone with website of American financial company Truist Financial Corporation on screen in front of logo.Source: T. Schneider / Shutterstock.comTruist Financial (NYSE:TFC) recently reported strong revenue growth and profits. As shares fall, TFC is among the stock winners from First Republic’s failure.Truist investors may buy the growing regional bank at a discount. The firm reported revenue growing by 15.0% Y/Y to $6.15 billion. In addition, the stock priced in the allowance for loan and lease losses is worth $4.5 billion.Customers cycled their money into money market accounts to capture the higher interest rate returns. Conversely, Truist’s wealth clients deployed their assets into investment accounts. The overall lack of business change is good news. Truist customers remain loyal amid First Republic’s closure.The firm expects demand deposit accounts to fall to the high-20s. This is due to normalization from Covid when stimulus checks increased customer cash levels.The company strengthened its balance sheet by selling 20% of its $14.75 billion stake in Stone Point Capital. This enables TFC to pursue more insurance deals to fuel its organic growth.Wells Fargo (WFC)Wells Fargo (WFC) bank sign in yellow and red with wagon logo. The sign is flanked by tall grassSource: Ken Wolter / Shutterstock.comWells Fargo (NYSE:WFC) might attract an influx in deposits as customers transfer funds out of regional banks.In Q1, Wells Fargo posted strong revenue growth. It continued to make progress in its efficiency initiatives. More importantly, the increase in delinquency and net charge-offs slowed. The bank is actively monitoring remote risk. This includes pockets of risk from commercial office real estate.The increase in net earnings, from $0.91 to $1.23 a share Y/Y suggests that Wells Fargo may increase its dividend. Patient investors will need to wait for banks to conservatively increase their cash on hand first. Once customer confidence increases for regional banks, big banks like Wells Fargo will reward its shareholders.Wells Fargo is de-risking its loan portfolio, especially its office portfolio. It decreased its commitment by 5% Y/Y. To minimize delinquencies, the bank is working proactively with borrowers to manage its exposure. The structural enhancements and pay-down will lower the chances of customer debt defaults.Zions Bancorp (ZION)a person putting a coin into a piggy bankSource: ShutterstockZions Bancorp (NASDAQ:ZION) is headquartered in Utah. The bank is among the best stocks to buy after First Republic’s failure. NII and Net interest margin (“NIM”) both rose by 2.6% and by 25%, respectively.CEO Harris Simmons said that higher interest rates set a positive trajectory for deposits. In the next quarter, expect loan growth and improved deposit flow as the banking sector puts First Republic’s closure behind it.Zions will grow its balance sheet amid the countervailing trends. Customers will recognize the safety of Zions. This will encourage them to open deposit accounts with a larger balance. Commercial depositors who want to have accounts in multiple banks should pick Zions Bancorp. In addition, Zions actively manages its relations with large customers. They too, will increase their balance.Similar to the aforementioned banks, Zions will need to manage its office property loan portfolio. When it reduces risks, it will book some credit losses, decreasing uncertainties for investors.On the date of publication, Chris Lau did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

Using the most recent financial data, we'll take a look at whether the stock is fairly priced by taking the expected future cash flows and discounting them to today's value. One way to achieve this is by employing the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model. There's really not all that much to it, even though it might appear quite complex.Companies can be valued in a lot of ways, so we would point out that a DCF is not perfect for every situation. For those who are keen learners of equity analysis, the Simply Wall St analysis model here may be something of interest to you. View our latest analysis for Target Crunching The NumbersWe're using the 2-stage growth model, which simply means we take in account two stages of company's growth. In the initial period the company may have a higher growth rate and the second stage is usually assumed to have a stable growth rate. In the first stage we need to estimate the cash flows to the business over the next ten years. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.A DCF is all about the idea that a dollar in the future is less valuable than a dollar today, and so the sum of these future cash flows is then discounted to today's value:10-year free cash flow (FCF) forecast2023202420252026202720282029203020312032 Levered FCF ($, Millions) -US$273.4mUS$3.60bUS$4.04bUS$4.77bUS$5.32bUS$6.23bUS$6.88bUS$7.42bUS$7.88bUS$8.28bGrowth Rate Estimate SourceAnalyst x6Analyst x7Analyst x7Analyst x3Analyst x2Analyst x2Est @ 10.42%Est @ 7.93%Est @ 6.18%Est @ 4.96% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 6.9% -US$256US$3.2kUS$3.3kUS$3.7kUS$3.8kUS$4.2kUS$4.3kUS$4.4kUS$4.3kUS$4.3k(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$35bStory continuesWe now need to calculate the Terminal Value, which accounts for all the future cash flows after this ten year period. The Gordon Growth formula is used to calculate Terminal Value at a future annual growth rate equal to the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield of 2.1%. We discount the terminal cash flows to today's value at a cost of equity of 6.9%.Terminal Value (TV)= FCF2032 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$8.3b× (1 + 2.1%) ÷ (6.9%– 2.1%) = US$178bPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$178b÷ ( 1 + 6.9%)10= US$92bThe total value, or equity value, is then the sum of the present value of the future cash flows, which in this case is US$127b. The last step is to then divide the equity value by the number of shares outstanding. Compared to the current share price of US$158, the company appears quite good value at a 42% discount to where the stock price trades currently. The assumptions in any calculation have a big impact on the valuation, so it is better to view this as a rough estimate, not precise down to the last cent.dcfImportant AssumptionsThe calculation above is very dependent on two assumptions. The first is the discount rate and the other is the cash flows. If you don't agree with these result, have a go at the calculation yourself and play with the assumptions. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Target as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 6.9%, which is based on a levered beta of 0.800. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.SWOT Analysis for TargetStrengthDebt is well covered by earnings and cashflows.WeaknessEarnings declined over the past year.Dividend is low compared to the top 25% of dividend payers in the Consumer Retailing market.OpportunityAnnual earnings are forecast to grow for the next 3 years.Trading below our estimate of fair value by more than 20%.ThreatPaying a dividend but company has no free cash flows.Annual earnings are forecast to grow slower than the American market.Looking Ahead:Valuation is only one side of the coin in terms of building your investment thesis, and it is only one of many factors that you need to assess for a company. It's not possible to obtain a foolproof valuation with a DCF model. Preferably you'd apply different cases and assumptions and see how they would impact the company's valuation. If a company grows at a different rate, or if its cost of equity or risk free rate changes sharply, the output can look very different. Can we work out why the company is trading at a discount to intrinsic value? For Target, there are three further factors you should look at:Risks: Consider for instance, the ever-present spectre of investment risk.   We've identified 5 warning signs  with Target (at least 1 which is potentially serious)  , and understanding them should be part of your investment process.Management:Have insiders been ramping up their shares to take advantage of the market's sentiment for TGT's future outlook?

The busy week of retail earnings will also include results from Target and TJX (TJX) on Wednesday, with Walmart and Alibaba (BABA) reporting Thursday.Outside retail numbers and housing data headlined by existing home sales and homebuilder sentiment, the week will be relatively quiet on the economic data front.In Washington, D.C., debt ceiling deliberations between President Joe Biden and House Speaker Kevin McCarthy are expected to continue early in the week as the government approaches the so-called ""X-date"" when the government would run out of borrowing capacity.Elsewhere in Washington, former top executives at Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank are expected to testify before the Senate on Tuesday.The benchmark S&amp;P 500 (^GSPC) finished last week lower despite inflation rising at its slowest annual rate in 2 years.

(Nasdaq: ADI), a global semiconductor leader, today announced a new €630 million investment at its European regional headquarters in the Raheen Business Park in Limerick, Ireland. The investment enables the construction of a new, state-of-the-art, 45,000 sq-ft Research &amp; Development and manufacturing facility.The new facility will support ADI’s development of next-generation signal processing innovations designed to accelerate the digital transformation of Industrial, Automotive, Healthcare, and other sectors. It is expected to triple ADI’s European wafer production capacity and aligns with the company’s goal of doubling its internal manufacturing capacity to enhance the resiliency of its global supply chain and better serve customer needs. This investment is expected to grow ADI’s employment footprint in the mid-west region of Ireland by 600 new positions, a significant increase to ADI’s current 1,500 employees in Ireland and 3,100 employees in Europe as a whole.Today’s announcement comes a year after ADI announced a separate investment of €100 million in ADI Catalyst, its 100,000 sq-ft custom-built facility for innovation and collaboration at its Limerick campus. Ireland is also home to ADI’s main European Research and Development Center, which has generated more than 1,000 patents since its inception and has seeded ADI R&amp;D sites throughout Europe in Spain, Italy, UK, Romania, and Germany.Story continues""Since 1976, Ireland has been a critical innovation center for ADI, thanks to its strong academic and research organizations, business ecosystem, and progressive government leadership,"" said ADI CEO and Chair Vincent Roche. ""This next-generation semiconductor manufacturing facility and expanded R&amp;D team will further extend ADI Limerick’s global influence. Through organic R&amp;D and close collaboration with our customers and ecosystem partners, we are striving to solve some of the world’s greatest challenges and enable a more efficient, safer, and sustainable future.""The new investment is planned as part of a collaboration within the European Union’s Important Projects of Common European Interest on Microelectronics and Communication Technologies (IPCEI ME/CT) initiative, and will support cross-border collaborative research. ADI’s IPCEI application – Ireland’s first since the inception of the Important Projects of Common European Interest (IPCEI) initiative – is subject to final approval from the European Commission, and is supported by the Irish Government through IDA Ireland.An Taoiseach Leo Varadkar TD said: ""This is a really significant announcement for Limerick and the Mid-West region, which marks a new chapter in the longstanding relationship between ADI and Ireland. This massive €630 million investment is great news for local employment with lots of jobs being created during the construction phase, and 600 high-end graduate jobs. It means a significant expansion in the size and scale of ADI’s research, innovation, and development, leading to new, highly innovative products. This investment is further evidence of the Government’s commitment to bringing jobs to the Mid-West. Most IDA jobs created in recent years have been outside of Dublin, and Limerick has done particularly well with its deep talent pool, universities, airport, and infrastructure. This investment will also mean lots of spin-off jobs and contracts for local SMEs and Irish-owned businesses. ADI’s investment is part of Ireland’s commitment to develop Important Projects of Common European Interest, IPCEIs, and will contribute to Europe’s broader microelectronics sector. The future is digital. There can be no such future without microchips and it’s great that Ireland is such an important player in the supply chain.""Minister for Enterprise Trade &amp; Employment Simon Coveney said: ""This is a much welcome announcement from Analog Devices and a great vote of confidence in Limerick and the Mid-West. It’s also noteworthy that it’s the latest in a series of major job announcements outside of Dublin. I’m struck not only by the scale of the investment, but also the high quality positions that will result. I’ll be visiting Analog Devices in Boston during a trade mission this week where we’ll be looking forward to many more years of doing business in Ireland.""IDA Ireland CEO Michael Lohan said: ""The technology that ADI will develop at this facility in Limerick is at the very forefront of innovation and has the potential to revolutionise the lives of billions of people across the world. This investment by ADI is intended to strengthen our supply chain resilience for advanced semiconductor processes. We wish continued success to ADI and look forward to our continued partnership. This is a transformational investment for the Limerick site, for the Mid-West region, and for the semiconductor industry in Ireland.

Indeed, the growth rates of most companies have been negatively impacted by inflation and surging interest rates. As valuation multiples decline, so too does investor confidence in this space. That said, there are some long-term growth stocks to buy and hold that are exhibiting indications of revival, kicking off to a much-improved start in 2023 following a dismal year in 2022. This resurgence is largely attributed to the macroeconomic factors that have come into play. It is uncertain whether this marks a new bull market for growth stocks. However, there are three options with the potential to profit from the shifting economic landscape.VVisa$231.22GOOG GOOGLAlphabet$112.28SHOPShopify$63.17Long-Term Growth Stocks to Buy and Hold: Visa (V)A businessman's hand arranging wooden cube blocks to represent growth stocks.Source: 3rdtimeluckystudio / ShutterstockIt’s earnings season. Accordingly, for giants like Visa (NYSE:V), investors are paying close attention to its results. Fortunately, Visa has seen impressive price action following its earnings report, as the company impressively brought in sales of $7.98 billion and earnings per share of $2.09. Both numbers surpassed forecasts. Notably, Visa was relatively unaffected by the banking crisis. To adjust to the swiftly developing fintech domain, Visa has broadened its services beyond conventional credit cards. Its growth has gradually revived in the post-pandemic period, with consumer spending on travel playing a significant role in this resurgence.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsVisa’s financial results for the first quarter indicate a healthy growth in revenue and earnings. Profits for the corporation were greater than expected, coming in at $7.9 billion instead of $7.7 billion. Furthermore, its earnings per share $2.18 outperformed what analysts expected by about 8.5%. This impressive performance can be attributed to the resurgence of global travel, which resulted in a 24% year-over-year rise in cross-border volumes on Visa credit cards.Story continuesThe past five years have seen impressive growth for Visa, with its revenue and adjusted profits per share growing at corresponding yearly compounding rates of 9.8% and 20.1%. The company’s net income margin has also improved, rising from 36% in fiscal 2017 to 51% in the last fiscal year, owing to a highly scalable business model. Visa has an impressive track record of success and promising growth prospects. That alone tells me it can emerge as a winner as one of the top long-term growth stocks to buy and hold.Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL)Hand of woman watering small plant in pot shaped like growing graph representing growth stocksSource: Khakimullin Aleksandr / ShutterstockIt’s a common misbelief that a progressive firm like Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL) would sit idly after ChatGPT’s groundbreaking debut. However, Alphabet reacted promptly by introducing its own formidable AI chatbot, Bard.Despite marginal revenue growth, the firm’s recent earnings of $1.17 per share and share buyback announcement bode well for investors. Plus, with a strategic focus on AI and other high-growth sectors, Alphabet ranks among the top growth stocks to buy and hold. Even better, the company just announced an additional $70 billion for stock buybacks in Q1. All indicating the company’s strong cash flow and confidence in its future. In addition, CEO Sundar Pichai mentioned the launch of its AI product, Bard, which will complement its search business. Alphabet’s expertise in deep learning places the company in a strong position to lead the industry in the future. Despite the emergence of ChatGPT, Alphabet currently dominates the search engine market with a 93.37% share of search queries. Microsoft’s Bing is a possible rival, but it presently only accounts for a 10% fraction of Google’s market share, thereby highlighting Google’s superiority.Shopify (SHOP)tree growing on coin of stacking with green bokeh background; growth stocksSource: Freedom365day / Shutterstock.comShopify (NYSE:SHOP) just said its latest revenue and profit surpassed forecasts. In fact, the company’s modified earnings per share decreased by a penny year over year, as its sales jumped 25% to $1.5 billion. Both numbers were better than expected by experts.

Source: Marriott International.Marriott, Hilton, and Hyatt have previewed new extended-stay hotel brands in the past month. The U.S-based hotel groups are wagering that a few factors will power extended-stay hotels for years to come, including U.S. federal infrastructure investment, the resilience of blended travel, and a housing crisis.Marriott International CEO Anthony Capuano said in an early May earnings call that his company was “a few weeks away from announcing a simple, modern, streamlined new-build, extended-stay product.” The new brand, Marriott’s 32nd, would target guests “looking for longer stays at a mid-scale price point,” he said. In November, Marriott International separately said it would debut an extended stay brand in the U.S. and Canada called Apartments by Marriott Bonvoy in a premium-priced segment.Hilton Worldwide CEO Chris Nassetta teased the previous week that the operator would debut an extended-stay brand within a few months. “It’s like an apartment efficiency meets hotel,” Nassetta said. The premium-economy brand would be all new construction rather than conversions, he said.Hyatt Hotels unveiled on April 18 a new brand, Hyatt Studios, as its entry into upper-midscale extended stay lodging in North America. The first of these properties are likely to open in 2024.Wyndham Hotels &amp; Resorts late last year rolled out its 24th brand, Echo Suites Extended Stay by Wyndham. The world’s largest hotel franchisor has already signed up developers to build 120 of them, and Echo Suites is the fastest-growing brand in its U.S. development pipeline.Airbnb continues to see roughly 20 to 24 percent of its bookings for lodging for stays of 28 days or more, up from 14 percent in 2019. On Wednesday, the online travel agency added a “months” tab to look for hosts accommodating longer-term guests.Extended Stay America, the segment’s best-known brand in the U.S., was bought for $6 billion by Blackstone and Starwood Capital in 2021. Those investors bought 111 WoodSpring Suites hotels for $1.5 billion last year, and Extended Stay America is rebranding those properties now as part of its new multi-brand growth strategy, which focuses on economy and midscale segments.Story continuesEven Best Western’s parent company BWH Hotel Group is getting into the act. It launched an extended stay brand late last year.And while Choice Hotels hasn’t launched a new brand, its WoodSpring Suites brand accounted for approximately 94 percent of the economy extended stay rooms under construction at the end of 2022. Choice Hotels was last year able to boost domestic extended stay franchise agreements in 2022 by a record 77 percent, year-over-year.So what’s driving the wide interest in extended stay — a category we’re defining as hotels whose rooms have fully equipped kitchens and typically have larger rooms and self-service laundry rooms.U.S. Extended-Stay Hotel Room Projections Through 2027SegmentRooms in 2022Percent in 2022Rooms in 2027Percent in 2027Compound Annual ChangeEconomy101,02018%132,77820%5.6%Mid-Price232,77041%273,67142%3.3%Upscale230,74041%251,87938%1.8%Total564,529100%658,328100%3.1%Source: The Highland GroupDemand for extended-stay lodging is outpacing supply by nearly three-to-one in most U.S. markets, said The Highland Group, a consultancy with the best data on the segment.In recent months, the economy, mid-price, and upscale segments saw demand increasing by double-digit percentages while supply rose by only low single-digit percentages, it said.“All extended-stay segments reported rate growth in March, but the upscale segment’s double-digit gain was the main driver of the overall 8.5 percent increase,” Highland Group said.Will the rush of hotel group announcements lead to an over-supply? After all, roughly a third of the construction pipeline for hotels in the U.S. is extended-stay projects, or roughly 30 percent of planned rooms, according to Lodging Econometrics.But oversupply is unlikely to happen anytime soon because of the multi-year gap to fill.“The new brands are not likely to have any material impact on national ES supply until 2025 at the earliest,” said Mark Skinner, a partner at the Highland Group.Long-Term Demand for Long-StayU.S. government spending on infrastructure is expected to support long-term demand for extended-stay hotels. The projects are nationwide, and construction managers and workers will be hitting the road.A housing crisis in the U.S. is another factor. After the 2008 financial crisis, home construction failed to keep pace with demand in many U.S. markets. The problem won’t be resolved anytime soon.“Recently, apartment rents have been very high, and many people are looking for a new place to hang their head for a minute until they get a new home, and that has been a tailwind for us,” said Extended Stay America CEO Greg Juceam.The resilience of blended travel, which Marriott said on Wednesday it sees no signs of abating, is another factor that may propel the extended stay category for years to come.It’s not just in hotels where the long-stay demand is appearing. Year-over-year records of nights sold in the fourth quarter showed a 29 percent year-over-year increase in U.S. stays across short-term rentals, estimated vacation rental data provider Key Data.Supply Side DriversDevelopers and hotel investors also have an increasing interest in extended-stay properties because of what they believe is a better business model than full-service hotels. The properties require less staffing because of less frequent guest changeover and housekeeping needs, which can help add to margins.“In general, branded extended stay brands, as well as select service midscale brands, tend to have the lowest breakeven occupancy and can thus offer higher operating margins and return on investment,” said Pranavi Agarwal, senior research analyst at Skift Research.“Though on the top line, extended stay brands will make a lower revenue per available room than luxury or upper upscale brands, on the bottom line, they can offer higher margins since extended stay brands and they tend to be less labor intensive than full-service brands — which are more reliant on low margin offerings such as food and beverage — as well as being less costly to build and generally having a lower percentage of their bookings coming from commission-high online travel agencies,” Agarwal said.Other analysts agreed.“Despite challenges to higher-rated corporate travel, we view quality extended-stay hotels with strong brand standards and efficient staffing as generally among the most profitable types of hotels,” wrote research analysts at Truist Gregory Miller and Patrick Scholes in a report on April 25.“Extended-stay hotels are also very popular for guests given large rooms and amenities that sometimes include food and beverage. Efficient labor costs, utilities, and relatively lower insurance costs may be additive for lender approval,” Miller and Scholes wrote.Get breaking travel news and exclusive hotel, airline, and tourism research and insights at Skift.com.]"

If you want to see more stocks in this selection, go to Billionaire Ken Fisher's Top 5 Stock Picks.Ken Fisher, the founder and co-chief investment officer of Fisher Asset Management, is widely known for his contributions to various financial publications as an author. Fisher is known for his contrarian investment strategies and his outspoken personality, which has sometimes landed him in controversy. Fisher said earlier this year that investors can strategically position their portfolios to benefit from the start of a new bull market by investing in categories that suffered the most during the bear market. Fisher believes that the market entered a new bull phase in October 2022 and expects growth-oriented sectors like information technology, which struggled last year, to perform well in the early stages of this phase.Ken Fisher discussed the ""pessimism of disbelief"" in a recent video. According to Fisher, this pessimism occurs when investors reject positive news, assuming it will eventually turn negative. He sees this type of pessimism as a positive sign for stocks since it's common at the beginning of bull market cycles.Billionaire Ken Fisher's top 10 stock picksFisher’s 13F portfolio value increased from about $148 billion in Q4 2022 to $165 billion in Q1 2023. During the first quarter, the fund added 181 new investments to its portfolio, increased its holdings in 377 existing stocks, divested from 52 equities, and decreased its positions in 510 stocks. The top ten stock positions add up to 26.02 % of the portfolio. Some of the most popular companies included in Ken Fisher's Q1 portfolio include Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), and Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL).Our MethodologyFor this article we picked the top 10 stocks from Ken Fisher's hedge fund portfolio for the first quarter of 2023.Billionaire Ken Fisher's top stock picks10. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (NYSE:TSM)Fisher Asset Management’s Holdings: $2,346,771,000 Story continuesPercentage of Fisher Asset Management’s Portfolio: 1.42%Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (NYSE:TSM) is the world's largest chip manufacturer.In the first quarter, Ken Fisher increased his stake in Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (NYSE:TSM) by 4%, and his 1.42% stake in the company is now worth about $2.35 billion. The most prominent shareholder in Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (NYSE:TSM) is Rajiv Jain’s GQG Partners, with 9,197,003 shares.Like Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), and Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (NYSE:TSM) is one of the top stock picks of billionaire Ken Fisher.Wedgewood Partners commented on Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (NYSE:TSM) in its investor letter for the Q1 of 2023.“Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (NYSE:TSM) contributed to performance as revenues grew +27% (in USD) from the year ago quarter. Despite this strength, the Company’s customers have seen near-term weakness in demand due to Covid-19 normalization as well as the launch timing of new products. However, the Company is well-positioned to continue a long-term growth trajectory because its leading-edge capacity is being absorbed by high-performance computing applications, particularly at nontraditional integrated circuit (IC) design houses, such as Apple, Alphabet and Amazon, which have become IC-design powerhouses over the past decade. Importantly, the Company’s aggressive investment in leading-edge equipment, tight development with fabless IC designers, and embrace of open development libraries, should continue to foster a superior competitive position and attractive long-term growth.”9. The Home Depot, Inc. (NYSE:HD)Fisher Asset Management’s Holdings: $2,478,511,000 Percentage of Fisher Asset Management’s Portfolio: 1.5%The Home Depot, Inc.

(NYSE:HD) provided an update on reducing the environmental impact of its stores. Since 2010, the company has reduced U.S. store electricity use by 50% by implementing LED lighting across all of its stores, buying electricity from large-scale commercial solar farms, and installing rooftop solar farms. The company is now applying its experience to other parts of its operations, including reducing electricity use in its supply chain and water use in store irrigation. Home Depot was also recognized by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency for being one of the nation’s largest green power users.”8. Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD)Fisher Asset Management’s Holdings: $2,579,321,000 Percentage of Fisher Asset Management’s Portfolio: 1.56%Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) is a semiconductor company that makes chips for various applications, including PCs, gaming, cloud services, and automotive.On May 3, Truist analyst William Stein increased Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD)'s price target to $84 from $79, but maintained a ‘Hold’ rating on the stock. Despite the company's revenue exceeding expectations due to the upside in Gaming and Embedded segments, the analyst is concerned about AMD's weaker Q2 guidance and increasing investments in AI.Fisher's hedge fund also strengthened its position in Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) by buying 431,867 additional shares in Q1.In its investor letter for Q1 2023, White Falcon Capital Management provided a comment regarding Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD).“Last quarter we added Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) to the portfolio at 18x earnings and quickly made it into a top 5 position. At that time, Mr. Market was worried about earnings revisions for semiconductor stocks. In Q1 2023, it has been one of our best performing positions with the stock up 50%! In just three months, the market realized that Artificial Intelligence (AI) and related technologies require a lot of semiconductors. Mr. Market really is manic depressive but this volatility can give the enterprising investor just enough of a window to pick stocks with attractive risk rewards.”7. NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) Fisher Asset Management’s Holdings: $2,798,969,000 Percentage of Fisher Asset Management’s Portfolio: 1.69%NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) provides graphics, compute, and networking solutions globally.Ken Fisher is also bullish on NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) as of the end of the first quarter of 2023. His fund increased its holding in NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) by 1% in the first quarter, ending the period with over 10.08 million shares of the company.GQG Partners, with 8,247,311 shares, is the biggest stakeholder in the company.Baron Funds made the following comment about NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) in its Q1 2023 investor letter:“NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) is a semiconductor mega-cap company and global leader in gaming cards and accelerated computing hardware and software. Shares of NVIDIA rose over 90% during the first quarter because of material developments in generative AI evidenced by the release of ChatGPT and other competitive models. On its fourth quarter fiscal 2023 earnings call on February 22, Colette Kress, NVIDIA’s CFO said, “AI adoption is at an inflection point.… The opportunity is significant and driving strong growth in data center that will accelerate through the year.” On the same call, Jensen Huang, NVIDIA’s CEO emphasized: “The accumulation of technology breakthroughs has brought AI to an inflection point. Generative AI’s versatility and capability has triggered a sense of urgency at enterprises around the world to develop and deploy AI strategies.… NVIDIA AI is essentially the operating system of AI systems today.… The activity around AI infrastructures…has just gone through the roof in the last 60 days. And so there’s no question that whatever our views [were] of this year as we enter[ed] this year has fairly dramatically changed as a result over the last 60, 90 days.” Indeed, our research indicates that shortages of NVIDIA GPUs3 are the biggest gating factor for AI adoption and that about 90% of AI-model training runs are performed on their GPUs. During its annual GTC conference4 in March, NVIDIA announced new products and services that expand its addressable market and together form a full AI computing platform. These included: (1) new AI training systems (where it is dominant) and inferencing systems (where the field is more wide open), such as specialized chips in the areas of large language models and recommender systems, simulation and graphics rendering, and video use cases; (2) new fully managed AI services in partnership with the major cloud service providers, called NVIDIA DGX Cloud and NVDIA Omniverse Cloud; (3) new domain-specific generative AI foundational models, branded NVIDIA AI Foundations, which NVIDIA customers can harness to build and train custom language models with their own proprietary data to develop differentiated offerings; and (4) industry-specific accelerator libraries, spanning such diverse verticals as genomics analysis and computational lithography. We continue to believe NVIDIA’s end-to-end AI platform and leading market share in gaming, data centers, and robotics (including automotive), along with the size of these markets, will enable the company to drive durable growth for years to come.”6.

When we think about how risky a company is, we always like to look at its use of debt, since debt overload can lead to ruin. We can see that Air Products and Chemicals, Inc. (NYSE:APD) does use debt in its business. But is this debt a concern to shareholders?Why Does Debt Bring Risk?Debt is a tool to help businesses grow, but if a business is incapable of paying off its lenders, then it exists at their mercy. If things get really bad, the lenders can take control of the business. While that is not too common, we often do see indebted companies permanently diluting shareholders because lenders force them to raise capital at a distressed price. Having said that, the most common situation is where a company manages its debt reasonably well - and to its own advantage. When we examine debt levels, we first consider both cash and debt levels, together. Check out our latest analysis for Air Products and Chemicals How Much Debt Does Air Products and Chemicals Carry?The image below, which you can click on for greater detail, shows that at March 2023 Air Products and Chemicals had debt of US$9.14b, up from US$7.54b in one year. However, because it has a cash reserve of US$2.51b, its net debt is less, at about US$6.63b.debt-equity-history-analysisA Look At Air Products and Chemicals' LiabilitiesWe can see from the most recent balance sheet that Air Products and Chemicals had liabilities of US$2.80b falling due within a year, and liabilities of US$11.9b due beyond that. On the other hand, it had cash of US$2.51b and US$2.34b worth of receivables due within a year. So its liabilities outweigh the sum of its cash and (near-term) receivables by US$9.89b.Since publicly traded Air Products and Chemicals shares are worth a very impressive total of US$61.7b, it seems unlikely that this level of liabilities would be a major threat. Having said that, it's clear that we should continue to monitor its balance sheet, lest it change for the worse.Story continuesWe measure a company's debt load relative to its earnings power by looking at its net debt divided by its earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) and by calculating how easily its earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) cover its interest expense (interest cover). The advantage of this approach is that we take into account both the absolute quantum of debt (with net debt to EBITDA) and the actual interest expenses associated with that debt (with its interest cover ratio).Air Products and Chemicals's net debt to EBITDA ratio of about 1.7 suggests only moderate use of debt. And its commanding EBIT of 18.1 times its interest expense, implies the debt load is as light as a peacock feather. Also good is that Air Products and Chemicals grew its EBIT at 14% over the last year, further increasing its ability to manage debt. There's no doubt that we learn most about debt from the balance sheet. But ultimately the future profitability of the business will decide if Air Products and Chemicals can strengthen its balance sheet over time. So if you're focused on the future you can check out this free report showing analyst profit forecasts.Finally, while the tax-man may adore accounting profits, lenders only accept cold hard cash. So we always check how much of that EBIT is translated into free cash flow. In the last three years, Air Products and Chemicals created free cash flow amounting to 16% of its EBIT, an uninspiring performance. That limp level of cash conversion undermines its ability to manage and pay down debt.Our ViewOn our analysis Air Products and Chemicals's interest cover should signal that it won't have too much trouble with its debt. However, our other observations weren't so heartening. For example, its conversion of EBIT to free cash flow makes us a little nervous about its debt. When we consider all the elements mentioned above, it seems to us that Air Products and Chemicals is managing its debt quite well. Having said that, the load is sufficiently heavy that we would recommend any shareholders keep a close eye on it. The balance sheet is clearly the area to focus on when you are analysing debt. But ultimately, every company can contain risks that exist outside of the balance sheet.

It’s fitting that my first book is a telling of their stories, how they’ve affected my life and how their experience in serving this country shows the need for bonds on and beyond the battlefield.

Staff Sergeant Jones served eight years in the Marine Corps with tours in Iraq and Afghanistan before an IED ended his career as a bomb technician, forever changing his life. Through the support of his brothers and sisters in arms, he began the arduous recovery and has since dedicated himself to paying it forward, working on behalf and with veterans for more than a decade. Featuring unfiltered and authentic conversations from across all branches of the military, Jones honors the true American heroes that not only defend this great nation, but protect their fellow warriors. With powerful lessons woven throughout these personal oral histories, along with a scrapbook of candid photos and an exploration of life, loss and even hunting, ""Unbroken Bonds of Battle"" will serve as a patriotic tribute to the tightknit community bonds built upon of faith, family and service.Story continuesSince the installment of FOX News Books, the publishing imprint has sold nearly 2 million copies, with each title placing on numerous national bestseller lists. The imprint launched in November 2020 with Hegseth’s ""Modern Warriors: Real Stories from Real Heroes,"" followed by Shannon Bream’s ""The Women of the Bible Speak"" (March 2021), ""All American Christmas"" by Rachel Campos-Duffy and Sean Duffy (November 2021), ""The Mothers and Daughters of the Bible Speak"" (March 2022), ""Faith Still Move Mountains"" by Harris Faulkner (October 2022) and most recently, ""The Love Stories of the Bible Speak"" (March 2023).

And the group that holds the biggest piece of the pie are institutions with 66% ownership. Put another way, the group faces the maximum upside potential (or downside risk).And institutional investors saw their holdings value drop by 8.5% last week. This set of investors may especially be concerned about the current loss, which adds to a one-year loss of 14% for shareholders. Often called “market makers”, institutions wield significant power in influencing the price dynamics of any stock. As a result, if the downtrend continues, institutions may face pressures to sell Walt Disney, which might have negative implications on individual investors.Let's delve deeper into each type of owner of Walt Disney, beginning with the chart below. See our latest analysis for Walt Disney ownership-breakdownWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Walt Disney?Many institutions measure their performance against an index that approximates the local market. So they usually pay more attention to companies that are included in major indices.We can see that Walt Disney does have institutional investors; and they hold a good portion of the company's stock. This can indicate that the company has a certain degree of credibility in the investment community. However, it is best to be wary of relying on the supposed validation that comes with institutional investors. They too, get it wrong sometimes. It is not uncommon to see a big share price drop if two large institutional investors try to sell out of a stock at the same time. So it is worth checking the past earnings trajectory of Walt Disney, (below). Of course, keep in mind that there are other factors to consider, too.Story continuesearnings-and-revenue-growthInvestors should note that institutions actually own more than half the company, so they can collectively wield significant power. Hedge funds don't have many shares in Walt Disney. The Vanguard Group, Inc. is currently the company's largest shareholder with 8.2% of shares outstanding. In comparison, the second and third largest shareholders hold about 6.8% and 4.0% of the stock.On studying our ownership data, we found that 25 of the top shareholders collectively own less than 50% of the share register, implying that no single individual has a majority interest.While studying institutional ownership for a company can add value to your research, it is also a good practice to research analyst recommendations to get a deeper understand of a stock's expected performance. There are plenty of analysts covering the stock, so it might be worth seeing what they are forecasting, too.Insider Ownership Of Walt DisneyThe definition of company insiders can be subjective and does vary between jurisdictions. Our data reflects individual insiders, capturing board members at the very least. The company management answer to the board and the latter should represent the interests of shareholders. Notably, sometimes top-level managers are on the board themselves.I generally consider insider ownership to be a good thing. However, on some occasions it makes it more difficult for other shareholders to hold the board accountable for decisions.Our information suggests that The Walt Disney Company insiders own under 1% of the company. As it is a large company, we'd only expect insiders to own a small percentage of it. But it's worth noting that they own US$44m worth of shares. It is good to see board members owning shares, but it might be worth checking if those insiders have been buying. General Public OwnershipThe general public-- including retail investors -- own 34% stake in the company, and hence can't easily be ignored. While this size of ownership may not be enough to sway a policy decision in their favour, they can still make a collective impact on company policies.Next Steps:I find it very interesting to look at who exactly owns a company. But to truly gain insight, we need to consider other information, too.I always like to check for a history of revenue growth. You can too, by accessing this free chart of historic revenue and earnings in this detailed graph.But ultimately  it is the future, not the past, that will determine how well the owners of this business will do. Therefore we think it advisable to take a look at this free report showing whether analysts are predicting a brighter future.NB: Figures in this article are calculated using data from the last twelve months, which refer to the 12-month period ending on the last date of the month the financial statement is dated.

Fearful customers withdrew deposits in droves. When the company revealed over $100 billion in withdrawals, it sealed First Republic’s fate.To protect depositors, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (“FDIC”) arranged for JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) to take First Republic over. It will undoubtedly benefit from the deal. The loss-share transaction will see the FDIC’s deposit insurance fund lose $13 billion. Because of the deal, the FDIC expects minimized disruptions for loan customers.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsJPM stock may gain from taking over First Republic, yet investors have seven other bank stocks that may fare better. The former may face closer government scrutiny as it manages First Republic’s assets. This would hamper its performance. Investors should instead look at bank stocks that benefit from First Republic’s failure.They offer more rewards over risks, especially when markets express excessive fears for the banking sector.GSGoldman Sachs$322.87MTBM&amp;T Bank$115.09 PNCPNC Financial$114.35TDToronto-Dominion Bank$61.48TFCTruist Financial$27.90WFCWells Fargo$38.45ZIONZions Bancorp$23.91Goldman Sachs (GS)In this photo illustration the Goldman Sachs Group (GS) logo displayed on a smartphone screen and a stock market graph in the backgroundSource: rafapress / Shutterstock.comGoldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) posted growth in assets under supervision in its first quarter to a record $2.67 trillion.The firm’s ability to attract assets suggests that it is among the best stocks to buy after First Republic’s failure.Goldman is undergoing a reset. It is working through deals that will add meaningfully to business growth. Look for aggressive mergers and acquisitions in the back half of this year. As bank valuations fall, Goldman Sachs may add companies that fit to its strategy. This includes its strategy of strengthening its leading global banking and markets franchise.Story continuesThe company is reducing its balance sheet density by $2.3 billion. It also includes reducing its principal investment portfolio to less than $15 billion by the end of 2024. That way, Goldman Sachs will have less exposure to the risk of falling asset values. Expect market headwinds to delay these deals. This will not hurt the firm’s commitment to grow its management fees.M&amp;T Bank (MTB)Piggy bank on a wooden table with stacks of coins next to it. Cryptos to BuySource: FabrikaSimf / ShutterstockM&amp;T Bank (NYSE:MTB) is indirectly one of the stock winners from the First Republic failure. In the last quarter, Darren J. King, Chief Financial Officer, said that the company has a strong, diversified community bank model. It managed the business prudently. As a result, M&amp;T Bank posted Q1 net income nearly doubling from last year.Investors need not worry about deposit losses. CFO Kig said that deposits did not change despite disruption in the overall market. In addition, commercial and wealth deposits both remain high.In the consumer space, depositors holding substitutes to take advantage of the rising rates. M&amp;T saw an increase in demand for money market savings and savings accounts.Skeptical investors thought that weaker deposit flows would gain momentum. Fortunately, the weaker demand balances are partly because of a seasonal pattern. Commercial customers need funds to pay taxes. In addition, they need to reduce their balance to align with their economic activities.PNC Financial (PNC)PNC bank logo on buildingSource: Jonathan Weiss/Shutterstock.comPNC Financial (NYSE:PNC) traded lower starting last month when it cut its revenue outlook. Investors ignored PNC posting revenue growing by nearly 20% to $5.6 billion. Deposits grew in the quarter.While PNC reported average deposits increased to $436.2 billion, up by 0.3%, markets worried about its outlook. The firm expects revenue between $21.96 billion and $22.18 billion. Revenue will grow by 4% to 5%, instead of an earlier forecast of 6^ to 8% Y/Y growth.Fearful depositors are decreasing their balance amounts. PNC is bucking this negative trend. The community bank expected that customers who accumulated stimulus money during Covid would draw that down. Looking ahead, PNC expects the Federal Reserve will keep rates higher for longer. It expects volatility in net interest income.Once the Fed indicates it will stop raising rates, PNC will revise its NII targets to the upside. Investors will buy PNC stock on the increased certainty.Toronto-Dominion Bank (TD)Illustration of the inside of a bank. Bank stocks.Source: YummyBuum / ShutterstockToronto-Dominion Bank (NYSE:TD) benefited immensely when regulators delayed its bid to buy First Horizon (NYSE:FHN). On May 4, both firms agreed to terminate the merger agreement.TD will make a $200 million cash payment to First Horizon. This adds to the $25 million fee reimbursement that was due from the merger agreement.TD is saving billions from the terminated deal. The Canadian bank will have more cash on hand, increasing its Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1) ratio. Investors will have higher confidence that the bank will absorb a financial shock. Expect investors to accumulate TD Bank stock, even though the stock gained from First Republic’s failure.TD may shop for other U.S. regional banks at a steep discount. The FDIC created a precedent of hurting the common and preferred stock prices of struggling banks. If it pauses its merger and acquisition strategy, TD may buy back shares instead.Truist Financial (TFC)Smartphone with website of American financial company Truist Financial Corporation on screen in front of logo.Source: T. Schneider / Shutterstock.comTruist Financial (NYSE:TFC) recently reported strong revenue growth and profits. As shares fall, TFC is among the stock winners from First Republic’s failure.Truist investors may buy the growing regional bank at a discount. The firm reported revenue growing by 15.0% Y/Y to $6.15 billion. In addition, the stock priced in the allowance for loan and lease losses is worth $4.5 billion.Customers cycled their money into money market accounts to capture the higher interest rate returns. Conversely, Truist’s wealth clients deployed their assets into investment accounts. The overall lack of business change is good news. Truist customers remain loyal amid First Republic’s closure.The firm expects demand deposit accounts to fall to the high-20s. This is due to normalization from Covid when stimulus checks increased customer cash levels.The company strengthened its balance sheet by selling 20% of its $14.75 billion stake in Stone Point Capital. This enables TFC to pursue more insurance deals to fuel its organic growth.Wells Fargo (WFC)Wells Fargo (WFC) bank sign in yellow and red with wagon logo. The sign is flanked by tall grassSource: Ken Wolter / Shutterstock.comWells Fargo (NYSE:WFC) might attract an influx in deposits as customers transfer funds out of regional banks.In Q1, Wells Fargo posted strong revenue growth. It continued to make progress in its efficiency initiatives. More importantly, the increase in delinquency and net charge-offs slowed. The bank is actively monitoring remote risk. This includes pockets of risk from commercial office real estate.The increase in net earnings, from $0.91 to $1.23 a share Y/Y suggests that Wells Fargo may increase its dividend. Patient investors will need to wait for banks to conservatively increase their cash on hand first. Once customer confidence increases for regional banks, big banks like Wells Fargo will reward its shareholders.Wells Fargo is de-risking its loan portfolio, especially its office portfolio. It decreased its commitment by 5% Y/Y. To minimize delinquencies, the bank is working proactively with borrowers to manage its exposure. The structural enhancements and pay-down will lower the chances of customer debt defaults.Zions Bancorp (ZION)a person putting a coin into a piggy bankSource: ShutterstockZions Bancorp (NASDAQ:ZION) is headquartered in Utah. The bank is among the best stocks to buy after First Republic’s failure. NII and Net interest margin (“NIM”) both rose by 2.6% and by 25%, respectively.CEO Harris Simmons said that higher interest rates set a positive trajectory for deposits. In the next quarter, expect loan growth and improved deposit flow as the banking sector puts First Republic’s closure behind it.Zions will grow its balance sheet amid the countervailing trends. Customers will recognize the safety of Zions. This will encourage them to open deposit accounts with a larger balance. Commercial depositors who want to have accounts in multiple banks should pick Zions Bancorp. In addition, Zions actively manages its relations with large customers. They too, will increase their balance.Similar to the aforementioned banks, Zions will need to manage its office property loan portfolio. When it reduces risks, it will book some credit losses, decreasing uncertainties for investors.On the date of publication, Chris Lau did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

Some of these companies have been around for nearly 100 years and are well-known household names. In their heyday, they led technological advances that transformed our lives and pushed society into the future. From personal computers and software applications to microchips and wireless internet. However, now that they are mature, established, and entrenched, many of these once-leading names have fallen out of favor with investors who are preoccupied with the new, shiny thing in tech. This is a shame as many legacy tech companies continue to be great businesses. It wouldn’t take much for their stocks to turn around and rise again. Here are seven legacy tech stocks primed for a comeback.ORCLOracle$96.55TXNTexas Instruments$161.18AMTAmerican Tower$195.63IBMIBM.$121.17TAT&amp;T$16.92HPQHP. Inc.$29.54INTCIntel$29.56Oracle (ORCL)Tech stocks: Double exposure of man's hands holding and using a phone and financial graph drawing.Source: Peshkova / ShutterstockLet’s begin with Oracle (NYSE:ORCL). Co-founded in 1977 by Larry Ellison, Oracle is a software company whose products help companies manage their human resources departments and supply chains, as well as other areas of their business. The company may have gotten a little long in the tooth, but it remains the third biggest software company in the world with annual revenues of more than $40 billion. Additionally, Oracle continues to issue strong earnings reports.Yet, the stock does not get as much love from investors as competing software concerns. So far in 2023, ORCL stock has gained 15%, which is half the 30% advance seen in shares of Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT). Long-term, Oracle’s stock performance appears better, with the share price doubling over the past five years. More recently, the stock has struggled a bit due to Wall Street’s negative views of its $28 billion acquisition of electronic medical records company Cerner. However, it may not be long before Oracle’s stock has a big breakout.Story continuesInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsTexas Instruments (TXN)A concept image of robot hands with stock information in between themSource: Blue Planet Studio / ShutterstockMany people still think about calculators when they hear the name Texas Instruments (NASDAQ:TXN). And for good reason. Calculators were the company’s bread-and-butter for much of its 93-year history. However, Texas Instruments today has gone well beyond the calculators it sells to middle and high school students. The company is now a major manufacturer of semiconductors and integrated circuits. In fact, Texas Instruments is one of the top 10 semiconductor concerns in the world.With more than 30,000 employees worldwide and annual revenues north of $20 billion, Texas Instruments is a formidable technology company. It also has more than 45,000 patents to its name and is a major holder of intellectual property rights. Yet TXN stock continues to drift sideways for the most part. In the last 12 months, the stock has declined 2%. While the stock has risen 50% in the past five years, it continues to trail other tech names.In addition, TXN stock offers a robust quarterly dividend that pays $1.24 a share for a yield of 3.05%. The shares look undervalued with a price-earnings ratio of 18. Most tech stocks the size of Texas Instruments trade at 25 times future earnings, or more, and offer no dividend payout.American Tower (AMT)Close up of phone with creative forex chart on blue background. Trade, finance, technology and communication concept. 3D Rendering. Tech Stocks to Buy Before the Bull Market ReturnsSource: Golden Dayz / Shutterstock.comAmerican Tower (NYSE:AMT) is technically a real estate investment trust. However, it is also a major technology company given that it owns the largest portfolio of wireless Internet towers in the U.S. American Tower is now adapting its infrastructure and towers to handle fifth-generation (5G) wireless as demand for the most powerful Internet skyrockets across the U.S. In business since 1995, American Tower today has more than 6,000 employees and revenues of nearly $10 billion.Despite the essential nature of its business, AMT stock has struggled. The share price is down 16% over the past year, including a 10% pullback so far in 2023. Through five years, the share price has gained a tepid 39%. As with Texas Instruments, American Tower pays a strong quarterly dividend that yields 3.22% or $1.56 per share. So what’s holding the stock back? Analysts claim it is the slow adoption of 5G wireless outside the U.S. That and higher debt servicing costs due to rising interest rates are expected to grow by $315 million in 2023.IBM (IBM)Photo of IBM (IBM) building as seen through the canopy of a tree. IBM logo is in large letters on side of building.Source: shutterstock.com/LCVBig Blue could be the poster child for legacy technology companies. In continuous operation since 1911, investors would be hard-pressed to find an older technology stock. Yet International Business Machines Corp. (NYSE:IBM) has undergone quite a bit of restructuring in recent years in an effort to improve its financial and stock performance. Changes have included the spin-off of its managed infrastructure business into Kyndryl (NYSE:KD), and the repositioning of the core IBM business as a cloud computing firm.IBM also continues to focus on the development of supercomputers through its quantum computing division which is focused on both commercial and scientific applications. Interest in the company’s quantum capabilities is growing with the rise of artificial intelligence. Yet all the changes have not been enough to move the needle on IBM stock. The company’s share price is down 10% over the past 12 months, bringing its five-year decline to 12%. A renewed focus on AI might be just the thing to finally push IBM stock higher.AT&amp;T (T)Graphic of side view of virtual financial charts with tech aesthetic, symbolizing fintechSource: shutterstock.com/whiteMoccaAT&amp;T (NYSE:T) is another technology company that is a household name in the U.S. but has struggled to gain traction with investors in recent years. The legacy company, which was founded in 1983, recently reported abysmal quarterly results that caused its share price to plunge 10%, marking the biggest one-day drop in T stock since the technology bubble burst back in 2000. Poor subscriber numbers hurt AT&amp;T’s earnings and led to a big selloff in the shares.However, T stock has been on the downslope for many years. In the past five years, the company’s share price has declined 30%. Alternating business strategies in recent years have sowed confusion among investors. The company first prioritized diversification, then shed its non-core assets, including WarnerMedia, to focus on growing its wireless internet service. But now, AT&amp;T says high inflation and rising interest rates have made consumers reluctant to spend money on 5G wireless. The good news is that T stock may have finally bottomed.HP Inc. (HPQ)Picture of Hewlett Packard Enterprise offices in Palo Alto, CA. HPE stock.Source: Sundry Photography / ShutterstockTechnology company HP Inc. (NYSE:HPQ) is a personal computer company that is best known for making printers. In business since 1939 and formerly known as “Hewlett-Packard,” the home where HP was founded in Palo Alto, California, has been labeled a historical landmark and marked with a plaque that reads: “Birthplace of Silicon Valley.” Now that’s a legacy tech company! Today, HP is still involved in its core business of computer hardware and printers, though it is increasingly focused on cutting-edge 3D printers.HP stock is another one that has lagged behind its peers in recent years. Over the last 12 months, HPQ stock has slumped 18%. Its five-year gain is only 33%. Yet HP is another old tech company that pays a very attractive dividend to its stockholders. Currently, the dividend yield on HPQ stock is 3.47%, which is high for any stock but exceptional among tech securities. Also, HP’s shares look significantly undervalued trading at a P/E ratio of only 12. Again, most tech companies the size of HP trade at more than double that rate.Intel (INTC)An Army soldier using a laptop representing BBAI Stock.Source: Gorodenkoff / Shutterstock.comIf any legacy technology stock is due for a rebound, it is microchip and semiconductor company Intel (NASDAQ:INTC). The company has been struggling mightily as it moves to transform its business to fabricating chips and semiconductors for other companies. Intel is spending more than $20 billion to reposition its chip factories as foundries. The effort is seriously impacting the company’s bottom line, resulting in Intel reporting the biggest loss in its 55-year history for this year’s first quarter.Specifically, Intel announced a 133% annual reduction in its Q1 earnings per share and reported that its revenue in Q1 fell 36% from a year earlier to $11.7 billion. This year’s first quarter marked the fifth consecutive quarter of falling sales at Intel. Owing to its big investments aimed at a turnaround, and the poor earnings, INTC stock has declined 45% in the last five years, including a 32% decrease in the past 12 months. However, once the transition to manufacturing microchips is complete, Intel could end up being a winner.On the date of publication, Joel Baglole held a long position in MSFT.

121,413bbbe5-4e4b-3d18-86ae-e73781c64bee,PSA,2023-05-15,3 REITs to Buy for Steady Income,InvestorPlace,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/3-reits-buy-steady-income-163041279.html,1683736241,STORY,"['O', 'FRT', 'PSA']","[Real estate investment trust or REIT stocks are popular with many income-oriented investors. Why shouldn’t they be? These stocks tend to have higher-than-average yields, and it’s a play on the real estate market, which is known for its cash flow. It almost always has certain investors looking for the best REITs for income.Interestingly, there can be broad exposure and niche exposure (like apartments, storage facilities, and data centers). Like everything, there are high-risk REITs to avoid and low-risk REITs that have low yields. The trick is to find a balance between both.Of course, REITs do not have an easy go of it right now. Higher interest rates have made borrowing more expensive, while pressure in commercial real estate has many investors fearing a “black swan” event — and rightfully so.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsThis space will likely have to navigate some potentially volatile situations. However, for long-term investors focused on REITs with consistent dividends that plan to use a dividend reinvestment plan (or DRIP), this volatility can be used to their advantage.Monthly Dividend REITs: Realty Income (O)realty income logo highlighted by a magnifying glass on a web browserSource: ShutterstockIf you want monthly income, Realty Income (NYSE:O) is your play. Known quite literally as The Monthly Dividend Company, it has created quite a track record of consistency. Although the dividend increases have been small lately, the firm has raised its dividend for 102 consecutive quarters.Yes, that’s right — quarters! So four times a year for more than 25 years now, Realty Income investors have gotten a raise. Imagine getting that kind of bump in your regular income.Further, the firm has paid a monthly dividend for 634 consecutive months or more than 52 years. The level of consistency here is really impressive. So when looking for REITs that pay monthly dividends, this one has to be on the list.When investors look at the firm’s portfolio, they’ll notice how strongly diversified it is. No more than 10.2% is allocated to any one industry, with a majority below 6%. On an individual company basis, no client makes up more than 4% of the firm’s business.Story continuesThey say investors should diversify their income streams when buying dividend stocks. Well, diversification is something that Realty Income clearly specializes in.Federal Realty (FRT)image of small toy homes with a red arrow pointing up to represent reits to buySource: ShutterstockWhen looking for the best REITs for income, Federal Realty (NYSE:FRT) is another name investors should consider.Federal Realty owns premium properties in great locations. According to the firm, “We own, operate and develop award-winning retail environments and mixed-use neighborhoods in the nation’s most desirable markets.”Further, “Our properties are located in eight major markets characterized by their superior demographics, high barriers to entry, and significant demand.”These are the types of things you want to see when looking for the best REIT stocks. However, when one is looking for high-yield REITs to buy now, Federal Realty is not normally on the list.Even now, it yields “just” 4.7%. That’s not bad for a normal dividend yield, but there are plenty of REITs that pay notably higher than that. However, Federal Realty has rarely yielded more than 4% over the past decade. In fact, above 3% was tough to find for a while! So I would consider the current opportunity to be a “high-yield” situation when looking specifically at Federal Realty.Further, Federal Realty has not only paid but has raised its annual dividend for 55 consecutive years, holding “the single longest annual dividend growth record among all REITs.”Public Storage (PSA)a Public Storage sign in front of a facility of storage buildingsSource: Ken Wolter / Shutterstock.comIt’s hard not to like Public Storage (NYSE:PSA) at some point. Some investors can decide that the stock is too expensive right now and wait for lower prices. Others may decide that the storage unit business is too good to ignore and begin accumulating shares in the near future.Either way, Public Storage is one of the best in the business. From the firm:“Public Storage is the world’s largest owner, operator and developer of self-storage facilities. Our more than 2,900 facilities across the United States serve nearly two million customers.”The company has amassed a startlingly large market capitalization of more than $52 billion. That makes it bigger than Realty Income and Federal Realty — combined! Public Storage currently pays a dividend yield of about 4%. On the downside, it doesn’t have the same consistency as the companies above.On the date of publication, Bret Kenwell did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

For example, over the last ten years, the shares have generated a return of 197%. So buying some of the high-quality stocks that Buffett owns is certainly a worthwhile strategy, especially for those who, like Buffett, focus on buying high-quality value stocks. In this column, I’ll outline three of the best dividend stocks in Warren Buffett’s portfolio.Buying dividend stocks is a cornerstone of Buffett’s strategy. That makes sense since these equities pay investors to wait during the times when their stock prices are dropping. Further, dividend stocks’ payouts can be used to buy more of their shares, resulting in a compounding of investors’ total returns.These three dividend stocks that Warren Buffett owns give investors those advantages. And not surprisingly, since Buffett owns them, their businesses and balance sheets are strong, while their valuations are attractive.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsAmerican Express (AXP)the American Express logo etched into woodSource: First Class Photography / Shutterstock.comIn a May 9 article, Bloomberg reported that pleasure cruise operators Royal Caribbean (NYSE:RCL) and Norwegian (NYSE:NCLH) have been “reporting smooth-sailing quarters.” Given those companies’ strong, recent financial results, Bloomberg, whose own commentators have generally been quite bearish about the U.S. economy, conceded that “it’s hard not project some cautious optimism about the US consumer.”The fact that even the pessimistic news service is becoming somewhat upbeat on consumer spending indicates, in my opinion, that such spending is indeed growing quite rapidly, while the trend will probably continue for a long time. And that, in turn, is good news for one of the dividend stocks that Warren Buffett owns, American Express (NYSE:AXP).Story continuesOf course, AXP is a credit card network that generates revenue every time a consumer uses one of its cards to make a purchase.Last quarter, AXP’s net income jumped almost 50% year-over-year, excluding a large surge in ” its credit loss provisions.”The stock has a low forward price-earnings ratio of 13.8 and a significant dividend yield of 1.57%.Louisiana Pacific (LPX)Oil. 3D Illustration. Oil stocks are up.Source: Pavel Ignatov / Shutterstock.comLouisiana Pacific (NYSE:LPX) “produces materials used in new home construction.”In March, I predicted that the housing sector would improve in “the medium term,” and that scenario appears to be materializing, making it one of the best dividend stocks in Warren Buffett’s portfolio. Indeed, Yahoo Finance recently reported that “home prices…have unexpectedly ticked higher month over month since the beginning of the year. “With housing prices climbing, builders will create more homes, and they will have to buy more of LPX’s products in order to do so.On the company’s first-quarter earnings call, held on May 3, LPX CEO Brad Southern said, “We are currently seeing encouraging signs of strength in housing, including improving commodity prices.”On May 4, TD Securities raised its rating on LPX to “buy” from “hold.” The firm expects the margins of the company’s siding business to rebound and anticipates that the company’s profits will increase in the last three quarters of the year versus Q1. It raised its price target on the shares to $75 from $63.LPX has a very low trailing price-earnings ratio of 5.5 and a significant dividend yield of 1.5%.HP Inc (HPQ)Image of the HP logo on a mesh computer caseSource: Tomasz Wozniak / Shutterstock.comAs I pointed out in a previous column published in April, “While…PC…sales slowed last year as consumers turned to “experiences” over the internet, the latter trend should ease soon as consumers’ need for experiences is partially satiated by the end of 2023.”Agreeing with my assessment, Morgan Stanley in February wrote that the sector could be nearing a “bottom,” and on May 5, the firm informed investors that it “believes that the PC market [formed] a bottom” in Q1. Similarly, AMD (NASDAQ:AMD) forecast in January that PC sales would rebound later in the year.Of course, a bottoming of PC sales would be great for HP (NYSE:HPQ), which “provides personal computing and other access devices, imaging and printing products.”In conjunction with its May 5 note, Morgan Stanley upgraded HP to “equal weight” and raised its price target on HPQ stock to $31 from $28.HP has a large dividend yield of 3.5% and a low trailing price-earnings ratio of 11.9 times.On the date of publication, Larry Ramer did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

But for now, where you land between 600-700 will determine which cards offer your best chance at approval.Check Out: The 15 Biggest Bank Failures in US HistoryI’m a Financial Planning Expert: Here Are 5 Things You Should Never Spend Money on If You Want To Be RichRanges vary by scoring model, and different card issuers have different standards. But according to Experian, scores between 580-669 are generally considered fair, and 670-739 is usually considered good. To avoid rolling the dice with a hard inquiry, use the card issuer’s preapproval tool to gauge your odds before you apply without impacting your credit.No credit score guarantees approval for any card, and issuers generally don’t list recommended scores. But they do offer guidelines for terms like “fair,” “good” or “excellent” credit to target specific applicants.If you’re in the 600s, you’re either fair or good — here are some of the best cards for both ratings.Chase Freedom Unlimited®If you’re in the high 600s and your other financials are strong, take a shot at the Chase Freedom Unlimited Visa card. Consistently ranked as one of the best daily-use cards on the market, it delivers perks usually reserved for people with excellent credit.U.S. News and World Report says you should have a score of at least 670 to apply.If you make the grade, you’ll have a shot at one of the best bonuses for any card with no annual fee. Cardholders receive cash back on everyday purchases — 5% back on travel purchases, 3% on drugstore and restaurant purchases and 1.5% for everything else. Better yet, the points never expire.New cardholders receive a bonus 1.5% in cashback on every purchase up to $20,000 spent in the first year — worth up to $300.Story continuesCapital One SavorOne Rewards for Good CreditLike Chase Freedom Unlimited, the Capital One SavorOne card offers rewards that you’d typically expect to earn only if you have excellent credit — but if you’re in the 600s, you’re in contention.Capital One states that this card is for applicants with “good” credit. The bank recommends applying if you:Have not declared bankruptcy or defaulted on a loan in the past 5 years.Have a credit card or loan.Have not been more than 30 days late on any payment in the last year.If you’re approved, you’ll earn unlimited 3% cash back on groceries, streaming, dining and entertainment. On all other purchases, you’ll still earn 1% cash back 1% back on everything else — all with no annual fee.Take Our Poll: Who Has Given You the Best Money Advice You Have Ever Received?Capital One QuicksilverOneCredit Karma calls QuicksilverOne “an accessible cash back card.” It’s open to those with average, fair and even limited credit, so if you’re in the low 600s, this card is a good place to start. It’s designed for people who, like you, are working to build better credit.Capital One says it’s for applicants with “fair” credit, who should apply even if they:Have defaulted on a loan in the past five yearsHave a limited credit historyHad a credit card for less than three years, including students, people new to the U.S., or authorized users on someone else’s credit cardYou’ll get 1.5% unlimited cash back on everyday purchases — an excellent perk for a fair-credit card that can quickly negate the $39 annual fee. The APR is a high  rate, but those trying to build credit will love that you’ll be reviewed for a higher credit line in as little as six months.Petal 2 Visa Credit CardForbes calls Petal 2 from WebBank “one of the best of the bunch when it comes to cards aimed at those with less-than-stellar credit.”Those in the low 600s are certainly in the running. The card has no fees whatsoever — a rarity for this class of cards — including annual fees, foreign transaction fees and even late fees.Petal 2 incentivizes responsible card use with a unique cash-back structure. You get 1% cash back right away when you make a purchase, but that’s bumped up to 1.5% after you make 12 on-time monthly payments. In addition, you can score bonus cash back of 2%-10% at select merchants.You’ll get a credit limit between $300 and $10,000, which can grow as you stay in good standing over time, and you’ll build credit with responsible use as the card reports to all three bureaus.More From GOBankingRatesWhy Stealth Wealth Is the Best Way To Handle Your MoneyGot a Question About Money?

(NYSE:WM) A Top Quality Stock?",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/boasting-33-return-equity-waste-140019706.html,1684072819,STORY,['WM'],"[While some investors are already well versed in financial metrics (hat tip), this article is for those who would like to learn about Return On Equity (ROE) and why it is important. We'll use ROE to examine Waste Management, Inc. (NYSE:WM), by way of a worked example.Return on Equity or ROE is a test of how effectively a company is growing its value and managing investors’ money. In short, ROE shows the profit each dollar generates with respect to its shareholder investments. Check out our latest analysis for Waste Management How Is ROE Calculated?The formula for ROE is:Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' EquitySo, based on the above formula, the ROE for Waste Management is:33% = US$2.3b ÷ US$6.8b (Based on the trailing twelve months to March 2023).The 'return' is the income the business earned over the last year. One way to conceptualize this is that for each $1 of shareholders' capital it has, the company made $0.33 in profit.Does Waste Management Have A Good ROE?By comparing a company's ROE with its industry average, we can get a quick measure of how good it is. The limitation of this approach is that some companies are quite different from others, even within the same industry classification. As is clear from the image below, Waste Management has a better ROE than the average (12%) in the Commercial Services industry.roeThat's what we like to see. However, bear in mind that a high ROE doesn’t necessarily indicate efficient profit generation. Especially when a firm uses high levels of debt to finance its debt which may boost its ROE but the high leverage puts the company at risk. To know the 2 risks we have identified for Waste Management visit our risks dashboard for free.How Does Debt Impact Return On Equity?Companies usually need to invest money to grow their profits. That cash can come from retained earnings, issuing new shares (equity), or debt. In the first and second cases, the ROE will reflect this use of cash for investment in the business. In the latter case, the debt used for growth will improve returns, but won't affect the total equity. Thus the use of debt can improve ROE, albeit along with extra risk in the case of stormy weather, metaphorically speaking.Story continuesWaste Management's Debt And Its 33% ROEIt's worth noting the high use of debt by Waste Management, leading to its debt to equity ratio of 2.15. There's no doubt the ROE is impressive, but it's worth keeping in mind that the metric could have been lower if the company were to reduce its debt. Debt does bring extra risk, so it's only really worthwhile when a company generates some decent returns from it.ConclusionReturn on equity is useful for comparing the quality of different businesses. A company that can achieve a high return on equity without debt could be considered a high quality business. If two companies have around the same level of debt to equity, and one has a higher ROE, I'd generally prefer the one with higher ROE.But ROE is just one piece of a bigger puzzle, since high quality businesses often trade on high multiples of earnings. It is important to consider other factors, such as future profit growth -- and how much investment is required going forward.

Today, we will estimate the stock's intrinsic value by taking the expected future cash flows and discounting them to today's value. One way to achieve this is by employing the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model. Models like these may appear beyond the comprehension of a lay person, but they're fairly easy to follow.Remember though, that there are many ways to estimate a company's value, and a DCF is just one method. For those who are keen learners of equity analysis, the Simply Wall St analysis model here may be something of interest to you. Check out our latest analysis for Valero Energy Crunching The NumbersWe are going to use a two-stage DCF model, which, as the name states, takes into account two stages of growth. The first stage is generally a higher growth period which levels off heading towards the terminal value, captured in the second 'steady growth' period. In the first stage we need to estimate the cash flows to the business over the next ten years. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.A DCF is all about the idea that a dollar in the future is less valuable than a dollar today, so we need to discount the sum of these future cash flows to arrive at a present value estimate:Story continues10-year free cash flow (FCF) forecast2023202420252026202720282029203020312032 Levered FCF ($, Millions) US$8.51bUS$6.45bUS$4.62bUS$3.89bUS$3.91bUS$3.44bUS$3.18bUS$3.03bUS$2.95bUS$2.91bGrowth Rate Estimate SourceAnalyst x7Analyst x8Analyst x5Analyst x1Analyst x1Est @ -11.80%Est @ -7.63%Est @ -4.71%Est @ -2.66%Est @ -1.23% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 9.8% US$7.8kUS$5.3kUS$3.5kUS$2.7kUS$2.4kUS$2.0kUS$1.7kUS$1.4kUS$1.3kUS$1.1k(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$29bThe second stage is also known as Terminal Value, this is the business's cash flow after the first stage. For a number of reasons a very conservative growth rate is used that cannot exceed that of a country's GDP growth. In this case we have used the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield (2.1%) to estimate future growth. In the same way as with the 10-year 'growth' period, we discount future cash flows to today's value, using a cost of equity of 9.8%.Terminal Value (TV)= FCF2032 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$2.9b× (1 + 2.1%) ÷ (9.8%– 2.1%) = US$39bPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$39b÷ ( 1 + 9.8%)10= US$15bThe total value is the sum of cash flows for the next ten years plus the discounted terminal value, which results in the Total Equity Value, which in this case is US$44b. In the final step we divide the equity value by the number of shares outstanding. Compared to the current share price of US$111, the company appears about fair value at a 9.8% discount to where the stock price trades currently. The assumptions in any calculation have a big impact on the valuation, so it is better to view this as a rough estimate, not precise down to the last cent.dcfThe AssumptionsNow the most important inputs to a discounted cash flow are the discount rate, and of course, the actual cash flows. Part of investing is coming up with your own evaluation of a company's future performance, so try the calculation yourself and check your own assumptions. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Valero Energy as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 9.8%, which is based on a levered beta of 1.299. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.SWOT Analysis for Valero EnergyStrengthEarnings growth over the past year exceeded the industry.Debt is not viewed as a risk.Dividends are covered by earnings and cash flows.WeaknessDividend is low compared to the top 25% of dividend payers in the Oil and Gas market.OpportunityGood value based on P/E ratio and estimated fair value.ThreatAnnual earnings are forecast to decline for the next 3 years.Looking Ahead:Although the valuation of a company is important, it ideally won't be the sole piece of analysis you scrutinize for a company. It's not possible to obtain a foolproof valuation with a DCF model. Preferably you'd apply different cases and assumptions and see how they would impact the company's valuation. If a company grows at a different rate, or if its cost of equity or risk free rate changes sharply, the output can look very different.

These enterprises command 25 years of consecutive dividend increases, offering a steady hand during troubled times.Fundamentally, one of the reasons why the best dividend aristocrats for long-term investors should appeal much more strongly now than before centers on their underlying resilience. Passive income must come from somewhere. Therefore, entities that consistently generate earnings should weather storms much better than those that don’t. Also, dividend aristocrats with high yield and growth potential offer a two-fer: they provide critical passive income while also facilitating upside return potential.HRLHormel Foods$40.22AMCRAmcor$10.36AFLAFLAC$66.46MCDMcDonald’s$295.67ATOAtmos Energy$118.75IBMIBM.$121.93XOMExxon Mobil$107.65InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsHormel Foods (HRL)stock market ticker screen with the word ""dividends"" appearing in large text.Source: iQoncept/shutterstock.comAn American food processing company founded in 1891, Hormel Foods (NYSE:HRL) makes an easy case for dividend aristocrats to buy and hold. With such a long and storied history, HRL isn’t just your run-of-the-mill passive income provider. No, with 57 years of consecutive dividend increases under its belt, Hormel represents one of the dividend kings.Fundamentally, Hormel offers predictability. Obviously, humans require a baseline minimum calorie intake. Therefore, investors can depend on the company to steadily deliver the goods. Also, its three-year revenue growth rate comes in at 9.2%, above 64.09% of its competitors. Therefore, it’s one of the best dividend aristocrats for long-term investors. Also, the company enjoys decent stability in the balance sheet. In particular, its Altman Z-Score comes in at 4.59, indicating low bankruptcy risk.Currently, Hormel’s forward yield is 2.74%, which is decent. Plus, it’s noticeably higher than the consumer staple sector’s average yield of 1.89%. Also, its payout ratio is 58.63%, which is “doable” in terms of sustainability.Story continuesAmcor (AMCR)A photo of a paper with a chart and the word ""Dividends"" written on it, with a pen and calculator resting on top of it.Source: jittawit21/Shutterstock.comA global packaging company, Amcor (NYSE:AMCR) develops and produces flexible packaging, rigid containers, specialty cartons, closures, and services for food, beverage, pharmaceutical, medical-device, home, and personal care, among other product categories. While relevant, AMCR hasn’t enjoyed an auspicious start this year, shedding almost 14% since the January opener. Still, for patient investors, AMCR could be one of the dividend aristocrats to buy and hold.Financially, Amcor isn’t particularly remarkable. For example, its three-year revenue growth rate pings at 6.3%, above 53.26% of its competitors. However, the company does enjoy business predictability, facilitating consistent annual profitability. Plus, its trailing-year net margin is 6.54%, above 71.35% of sector players.Enticingly, Amcor carries a forward yield of 4.75%. Moreover, it commands 40 years of consecutive dividend increases. With a decade to go before becoming a king of passive income, AMCR rates as one of the top dividend aristocrats to buy now.AFLAC (AFL)A hand reaches out of a mailbox holding a wad of cash.Source: ShutterstockWhile not the most exciting name in the capital markets, AFLAC (NYSE:AFL) deserves closer inspection thanks to its relevancy. Specializing in supplemental insurance, Aflac covers the gaps that traditional insurance programs miss. With all that’s transpired in the ugly Covid-19 pandemic, households may be better attuned to seeking financial protection. Therefore, AFL makes a case for dividend aristocrats to buy and hold.Similar to Amcor above, Aflac doesn’t deliver particularly standout financial metrics. To be honest, its 0.9% three-year revenue growth rate is very ho-hum. At the same time, insurance companies suffered badly during the crisis. On a positive note, AFL trades at only 9.71 times trailing earnings, which is decently undervalued.Turning to passive income, Aflac’s forward yield comes out to 2.49%. Though not the most generous yield, the company commands 40 years of consecutive annual dividend increases. As well, its payout ratio sits at 27.52%, presenting high sustainability confidence. If you just want to get through the current mess reliably, AFL deserves to be on your list of best dividend aristocrats for long-term investors.McDonald’s (MCD)Source: ShutterstockA fast-food icon and a symbol of American capitalism, McDonald’s (NYSE:MCD) intrigues for myriad reasons. On the fundamental front, the Golden Arches benefits from the trade-down effect. Essentially, it’s practically impossible for most households to be complete luddites regarding eating out, even during economic hardships. Fortunately, McDonald’s provides good eating – or so InvestorPlace’s Will Ashworth claims – and low prices.Financially, the company holds its own though it’s not remarkable across the board. Its three-year revenue growth rate pings at 3.8%, which outpaces 71.17% of the restaurant industry. Also, it’s consistently profitable, which is what you want to see with your dividend aristocrats to buy and hold. Right now, its trailing-year net margin stands at 29.36%, above 96.54% of sector players.For passive income, the fast-food king is almost a dividend king, commanding 46 years of consecutive annual increases. To be fair, its forward yield is modest at 2.05%. Nevertheless, it does beat the consumer discretionary sector’s average yield of 1.89.%Atmos Energy (ATO)sheet of paper marked ""dividends"" with a $20 bill on top of it to represent dividend stocksSource: ShutterstockHeadquartered in Dallas, Texas, Atmos Energy (NYSE:ATO) is one of the nation’s largest natural gas-only distributors. Per its public profile, Atmos serves about three million natural gas distribution customers in over 1,400 communities in nine states. Atmos Energy also manages company-owned natural gas pipeline and storage assets, including one of the largest intrastate natural gas pipeline systems in Texas.Since the start of the year, ATO gained almost 7% of its equity value. Financially, the company again doesn’t have an outstandingly distinct profile. For example, its three-year revenue growth rate of 7.2% is just a bit below average. On the other hand, the company’s net margin is 18.18%, above 83.16% of competitors. And it’s consistently profitable.Another strong example of a dividend aristocrat to buy and hold, Atmos commands 39 years of consecutive dividend increases. Its payout ratio is relatively low too at 46.27%. About the only drawback is that it’s not the most generous at a forward yield of 2.5%. Still, Wall Street analysts peg ATO as a consensus strong buy. Therefore, it ranks as one of the top dividend aristocrats to buy now.IBM (IBM)The word ""dividend"" highlighted in a dictionary.Source: ShutterstockLong derided as a fading legacy technology outfit, IBM (NYSE:IBM) has made a concerted effort to regain its mojo. Arguably, it’s done just that, focusing on leadership positions in burgeoning fields such as the hybrid cloud. It also experiments with other compelling innovations such as artificial intelligence and the blockchain. Being a generous provider of passive income, “Big Blue” is one of the dividend aristocrats to buy and hold.What I like about IBM is its forward-looking potential. No, it’s clearly not a growth machine in the strictest sense of the term. However, in 2022, the company posted revenue of $60.53 billion, up 5.54% from 2021’s tally of $57,351. That’s not bad at all for an enterprise that started off in June 1911. Back then, William Howard Taft was the President of the U.S.For passive income, IBM carries a forward yield of 5.48%, well above the tech sector’s average yield of 1.37%. It also features 30 years of consecutive dividend increases. From a contextual standpoint, IBM ranks among the dividend aristocrats with high yield and growth.Exxon Mobil (XOM)dividend stocksSource: ShutterstockWhile the rise of electric vehicles seemingly makes hydrocarbon specialists obsolete, such a complete transition might not happen for a very long time (if ever). Therefore, investors can trust Exxon Mobil (NYSE:XOM), which ranks among the dividend aristocrats to buy and hold. Plus, with international factors potentially catalyzing XOM, it’s one of the top enterprises to watch.Financially, the company recovered well from the Covid-19 disaster. On the top line, Exxon’s three-year revenue growth rate stands at 15.9%, above 65.02% of the field. Also, its EBITDA growth rate during the same period is 37%, above 72.26% of sector peers.Enticingly, Exxon carries a forward yield of 3.34%. Though not the highest yield in the energy sector, it’s one of the more reliable with a payout ratio of 37.57%. Also, it commands 40 years of consecutive annual dividend increases, a status it will not give up without a fight. Overall, analysts peg XOM as a moderate buy with a price target of $130.54, implying nearly 20% upside potential. Thus, it’s one of the dividend aristocrats with high yield and growth.On the date of publication, Josh Enomoto did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.A former senior business analyst for Sony Electronics, Josh Enomoto has helped broker major contracts with Fortune Global 500 companies.

139,413bbbe5-4e4b-3d18-86ae-e73781c64bee,FRT,2023-05-15,3 REITs to Buy for Steady Income,InvestorPlace,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/3-reits-buy-steady-income-163041279.html,1683736241,STORY,"['O', 'FRT', 'PSA']","[Real estate investment trust or REIT stocks are popular with many income-oriented investors. Why shouldn’t they be? These stocks tend to have higher-than-average yields, and it’s a play on the real estate market, which is known for its cash flow. It almost always has certain investors looking for the best REITs for income.Interestingly, there can be broad exposure and niche exposure (like apartments, storage facilities, and data centers). Like everything, there are high-risk REITs to avoid and low-risk REITs that have low yields. The trick is to find a balance between both.Of course, REITs do not have an easy go of it right now. Higher interest rates have made borrowing more expensive, while pressure in commercial real estate has many investors fearing a “black swan” event — and rightfully so.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsThis space will likely have to navigate some potentially volatile situations. However, for long-term investors focused on REITs with consistent dividends that plan to use a dividend reinvestment plan (or DRIP), this volatility can be used to their advantage.Monthly Dividend REITs: Realty Income (O)realty income logo highlighted by a magnifying glass on a web browserSource: ShutterstockIf you want monthly income, Realty Income (NYSE:O) is your play. Known quite literally as The Monthly Dividend Company, it has created quite a track record of consistency. Although the dividend increases have been small lately, the firm has raised its dividend for 102 consecutive quarters.Yes, that’s right — quarters! So four times a year for more than 25 years now, Realty Income investors have gotten a raise. Imagine getting that kind of bump in your regular income.Further, the firm has paid a monthly dividend for 634 consecutive months or more than 52 years. The level of consistency here is really impressive. So when looking for REITs that pay monthly dividends, this one has to be on the list.When investors look at the firm’s portfolio, they’ll notice how strongly diversified it is. No more than 10.2% is allocated to any one industry, with a majority below 6%. On an individual company basis, no client makes up more than 4% of the firm’s business.Story continuesThey say investors should diversify their income streams when buying dividend stocks. Well, diversification is something that Realty Income clearly specializes in.Federal Realty (FRT)image of small toy homes with a red arrow pointing up to represent reits to buySource: ShutterstockWhen looking for the best REITs for income, Federal Realty (NYSE:FRT) is another name investors should consider.Federal Realty owns premium properties in great locations. According to the firm, “We own, operate and develop award-winning retail environments and mixed-use neighborhoods in the nation’s most desirable markets.”Further, “Our properties are located in eight major markets characterized by their superior demographics, high barriers to entry, and significant demand.”These are the types of things you want to see when looking for the best REIT stocks. However, when one is looking for high-yield REITs to buy now, Federal Realty is not normally on the list.Even now, it yields “just” 4.7%. That’s not bad for a normal dividend yield, but there are plenty of REITs that pay notably higher than that. However, Federal Realty has rarely yielded more than 4% over the past decade. In fact, above 3% was tough to find for a while! So I would consider the current opportunity to be a “high-yield” situation when looking specifically at Federal Realty.Further, Federal Realty has not only paid but has raised its annual dividend for 55 consecutive years, holding “the single longest annual dividend growth record among all REITs.”Public Storage (PSA)a Public Storage sign in front of a facility of storage buildingsSource: Ken Wolter / Shutterstock.comIt’s hard not to like Public Storage (NYSE:PSA) at some point. Some investors can decide that the stock is too expensive right now and wait for lower prices. Others may decide that the storage unit business is too good to ignore and begin accumulating shares in the near future.Either way, Public Storage is one of the best in the business. From the firm:“Public Storage is the world’s largest owner, operator and developer of self-storage facilities. Our more than 2,900 facilities across the United States serve nearly two million customers.”The company has amassed a startlingly large market capitalization of more than $52 billion. That makes it bigger than Realty Income and Federal Realty — combined! Public Storage currently pays a dividend yield of about 4%. On the downside, it doesn’t have the same consistency as the companies above.On the date of publication, Bret Kenwell did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

(NYSE:FCX) Given Its Attractive Financial Prospects?,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/could-market-wrong-freeport-mcmoran-143825095.html,1684075105,STORY,['FCX'],"[Freeport-McMoRan (NYSE:FCX) has had a rough month with its share price down 19%. However, stock prices are usually driven by a company’s financial performance over the long term, which in this case looks quite promising. Specifically, we decided to study Freeport-McMoRan's  ROE in this article.Return on equity or ROE is a key measure used to assess how efficiently a company's management is utilizing the company's capital. In other words, it is a profitability ratio which measures the rate of return on the capital provided by the company's shareholders. View our latest analysis for Freeport-McMoRan How Do You Calculate Return On Equity?Return on equity can be calculated by using the formula:Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' EquitySo, based on the above formula, the ROE for Freeport-McMoRan is:14% = US$3.6b ÷ US$26b (Based on the trailing twelve months to March 2023).The 'return' is the income the business earned over the last year. That means that for every $1 worth of shareholders' equity, the company generated $0.14 in profit.What Is The Relationship Between ROE And Earnings Growth?We have already established that ROE serves as an efficient profit-generating gauge for a company's future earnings. We now need to evaluate how much profit the company reinvests or ""retains"" for future growth which then gives us an idea about the growth potential of the company. Assuming everything else remains unchanged, the higher the ROE and profit retention, the higher the growth rate of a company compared to companies that don't necessarily bear these characteristics.Freeport-McMoRan's Earnings Growth And 14% ROETo start with, Freeport-McMoRan's ROE looks acceptable. Even when compared to the industry average of 15% the company's ROE looks quite decent. This probably goes some way in explaining Freeport-McMoRan's significant 21% net income growth over the past five years amongst other factors. We reckon that there could also be other factors at play here. For instance, the company has a low payout ratio or is being managed efficiently.Story continuesAs a next step, we compared Freeport-McMoRan's net income growth with the industry and were disappointed to see that the company's growth is lower than the industry average growth of 31% in the same period.past-earnings-growthEarnings growth is a huge factor in stock valuation. It’s important for an investor to know whether the market has priced in the company's expected earnings growth (or decline). Doing so will help them establish if the stock's future looks promising or ominous. Has the market priced in the future outlook for FCX? You can find out in our latest intrinsic value infographic research report. Is Freeport-McMoRan Efficiently Re-investing Its Profits?Freeport-McMoRan's three-year median payout ratio to shareholders is 11%, which is quite low. This implies that the company is retaining 89% of its profits. So it seems like the management is reinvesting profits heavily to grow its business and this reflects in its earnings growth number.Moreover, Freeport-McMoRan is determined to keep sharing its profits with shareholders which we infer from its long history of paying a dividend for at least ten years. Looking at the current analyst consensus data, we can see that the company's future payout ratio is expected to rise to 25% over the next three years. Despite the higher expected payout ratio, the company's ROE is not expected to change by much.SummaryOverall, we are quite pleased with Freeport-McMoRan's performance. Specifically, we like that the company is reinvesting a huge chunk of its profits at a high rate of return. This of course has caused the company to see a good amount of growth in its earnings. With that said, the latest industry analyst forecasts reveal that the company's earnings growth is expected to slow down.

If we look outside of the year-to-date and one-year performances, we can focus on dividend stocks for steady income rather than purely on performance. These are dividend stocks with consistent payouts and a history of being shareholder friendly.Some investors want dividend stocks with long-term growth potential. Others want dividend stocks that never cut dividends.Given that there is a decently large group of stocks out there that have not only paid, but raised, their annual payouts for four or more decades, there are a lot of names to choose from.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsUltimately, we are on the hunt for companies that have businesses that won’t go out of style, will adapt to the ever-changing times and have a management that’s focused on the payout.With that, let’s look at some dividend stocks that will have steady income for decades to come.PepsiCo (PEP)Pepsi (PEP) Factory in Samara, Russia. Pepsi logo on a blue warehouse.Source: FotograFFF / ShutterstockPepsiCo (NYSE:PEP) has been one of the leading dividend stocks for steady income for several decades now. However, more than just income-oriented investors have been piling into this one, as the stock recently hit all-time highs as it closed in on the $200 area.The latest dividend increase was a 10% bump, while the firm also recently raised its full-year organic growth guidance. I like PepsiCo not just because the company has raised its annual payout for 51 consecutive years, but because it has a very strong brand.That brand spans across the entire grocery store. Whether that’s orange juice, Pepsi, or Cheetos, the firm has its hands all over the food and beverage world.One knock? PepsiCo stock pays a dividend yield of “just” 2.6%. In a world where investors can get a risk-free yield in excess of 5% in US Treasury bills, this type of payout is not exactly blowing off the roof.Story continuesThat said, this yield will swell on a pullback. As outlined, the firm has raised this payout every year for more than five decades. I suspect it will repeat that streak in the future.Starbucks (SBUX)Learnin' From Luckin, Starbucks Stock Heats Up a StrategySource: monticello / Shutterstock.comStarbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX) is not yet a dividend aristocrat, which is described as: “companies in the S&amp;P 500 index that have increased their dividends in each of the past 25 consecutive years.”However, Starbucks’ management has made the dividend a focus. While the company currently yields 1.98%, which is admittedly a low payout, it has been raised 12 years in a row now. The five-year growth rate is at an impressive 13.15%.Long-term bulls will argue that the company continues to rapidly grow its business. Analysts expect double-digit sales growth this year and next year alongside 16% earnings growth in 2023 and almost 20% growth in 2024.Starbucks is a cash cow and will continue to that trend for many years into the future. In some ways, it reminds me of McDonald’s (NYSE:MCD) from a few decades ago — a name that could be on this list as well!Procter &amp; Gamble (PG)Source: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.comLast but not least, we have a true dividend champion in Procter &amp; Gamble (NYSE:PG). P&amp;G has paid — and raised– its annual dividend for 67 consecutive years. It’s in rarified air when we talk about dividend hikes.Like PepsiCo though, the run in the stock price has lowered the dividend yield. While the stock currently pays out a 2.44% yield, shares recently hit a 52-week high and are just a stone’s throw from all-time highs. It’s a tad rich at roughly 26 times earnings.Does that make it a buy right here, right now?Not necessarily. Ideally, we will get a healthy pullback in this name, allowing investors to lower their risk (and raise their yield) and/or accumulate the stock at lower prices. However investors choose to approach P&amp;G though, understand it’s a dividend champion and for good reason.On the date of publication, Bret Kenwell did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

When investors reinvest their dividends, they passively buy more shares, increasing future dividend payouts. This cycle increases an investor’s total return annually and over time. This is a key reason for investors to look for dividend stocks with rising dividends.  This isn’t to say that dividend yield isn’t important. Investors should also pay close attention to the company’s payout ratio. The two of these ratios put together say a lot about the sustainability of a dividend. But finding dividend stocks with payout hikes should be seen as an “in addition to” rather than an “or.” In fact, many of the top dividend stocks combine an attractive yield with a rising dividend.We’re only in early May, but already some solid dividend-paying stocks such as Home Depot (NYSE:HD), Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ), and PepsiCo (NASDAQ:PEP) have increased their dividend payouts. Johnson &amp; Johnson and Pepsi are dividend kings, which means they have increased their payouts for at least 50 consecutive years.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsWho else may be increasing their dividend? This article will highlight three dividend stocks with upcoming payout increases in 2023. Each of these stocks are also good candidates for investors looking for buy-and-hold candidates in a volatile market.Microsoft (MSFT) Microsoft and Activision Blizzard logo on smartphone screen close-upSource: FellowNeko / Shutterstock.comFirst on this list of dividend stocks with rising dividends is Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT). The tech sector has been volatile, but MSFT stock is up 16% in the last month. And the company delivered a strong earnings report in April that included record revenue of over $52 billion.  Microsoft is a good example of a company that isn’t resting on its previous success. The company’s software business began its cloud computing division. The company may have been rebuffed in its effort to acquire Activision Blizzard (NASDAQ:ATVI), but it’s still a key name in gaming.Story continuesAnd in 2023, the company will be one of the preeminent names in artificial intelligence (AI). The company has multiple revenue streams that set the company up for future growth. Plus, investors considering MSFT stock as part of their portfolio shouldn’t overlook the company’s rock-solid balance sheet. That includes $57.5 billion in free cash flow that the tech giant logged in the last 12 months. All of this points to sustainable long-term growth. And that growth will be more than enough to fund – and increase – the company’s dividend.  Microsoft has increased its dividend for the last 20 years. And if history repeats itself, as it’s likely to do, shareholders can expect an increase when the company reports first-quarter earnings for fiscal year 2024 in September 2023.Target (TGT) tgt stockSource: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.comIn volatile markets, it’s important to buy the best and forget the rest. Target (NYSE:TGT) is considered one of the best names in the retail sector. One reason for investors to believe in TGT stock in this flight to quality is the reliability of its dividend.Target is a dividend king that has increased its dividend for the last 51 consecutive years. There’s been a recession or two in that time. Yet Target has continued to reward shareholders. That speaks to the strength of its balance sheet.And why am I confident that this time will be the same? Target is sitting in a sweet spot with consumers. The company already enjoys a cult-like following. But as the economy weakens, it is attracting some consumers who are trading down. It’s also attracting some dollar store shoppers who are finding they can do all their shopping at Target.The company’s dividend payout ratio is over 70%, which is considered high. But analysts are expecting a sharp increase in earnings in the next year, which should easily support another dividend increase.Caterpillar (CAT) A Caterpillar backhoe at the top of a hillSource: aapsky / Shutterstock.comThe last stock on this brief list of dividend stocks with rising dividends is Caterpillar (NYSE:CAT). The iconic manufacturer of heavy equipment stands to benefit from the Infrastructure Act passed in 2022. That money is just beginning to flow into the economy, which sets the company up for strong growth.The company delivered a solid earnings report in April. But investors are balking at the company’s weaker guidance for the rest of the year. That’s being reflected in the CAT stock price, which is down 10% in 2023.But this is an article that’s pointing you toward quality dividend stocks for the long haul. Caterpillar fits that category nicely. The company has increased its dividend for 30 consecutive years. This puts it in the dividend aristocrat category.
