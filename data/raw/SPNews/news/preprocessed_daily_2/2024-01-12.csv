3,6eb84c39-dbf0-3509-ad04-7731b7c532d1,SCHW,2024-01-12,Introducing the Schwab Trading Activity Index™,Business Wire,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/introducing-schwab-trading-activity-index-133000575.html,1704979800,STORY,['SCHW'],"[""Monthly report, formerly the TD Ameritrade Investor Movement Index®, provides unique insights into retail trading behavior at an unprecedented scale from Schwab's millions of retail investor clients"", 'WESTLAKE, Texas, January 11, 2024--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Schwab today introduced the Schwab Trading Activity Index (STAX), offering timely insights into retail trading behavior from one of the industry’s largest retail investor client bases. Building on the success of the TD Ameritrade Investor Movement Index® (IMXSM), launched in 2013, the STAX is a new proprietary, behavior-based index that analyzes retail investor stock positions and trading activity to illuminate what investors were actually doing and how they were positioned in the markets each month.', 'Following an aggregated and anonymized analysis of Schwab’s millions of client accounts, the STAX determines a score, generally ranging from 35-70, that serves as a proxy to gauge Schwab clients’ exposure to equity markets. Over time, changes in this score month-by-month serve as an indirect measure of sentiment, with a higher score indicating greater market exposure and a correlation to bullishness, and a lower score indicating lower market exposure associated with potential bearishness. For example, if the STAX score rises from 40 to 50 from one month to the next, that would indicate that Schwab’s clients, on a whole, increased their exposure to the equity markets and could mark a rise in bullish sentiment.', '""As we near completion in the first half of 2024 of the industry’s largest integration of its kind, Schwab is emerging as an even stronger leader in the retail investing and trading space, serving a wide range of investors including High Net Worth, people seeking wealth management and advice, sophisticated traders, and those just getting started on their investing journey,"" said James Kostulias, head of Trading Services at Charles Schwab. ""The introduction of STAX is a reflection of Schwab’s leadership position in the industry and our deep understanding of trading behavior and sentiment. Going forward, we view STAX as a unique proxy for what’s happening across an incredibly diverse mix of retail investors and traders on a month-to-month basis, and we expect it to be a useful resource for clients, academics, media, and anyone else seeking to understand and keep a pulse on retail trading behavior.""', 'December Insights', 'The STAX score for December 2023 reads 44.56, an increase from the November score of 43.64.', 'The reading for the five-week period ending December 29, 2023 ranks ""moderate low"" compared to historic averages.', '""The holidays tend to be an optimistic time of year for many, and this year was no exception among Schwab’s clients,"" said Joe Mazzola, Director of Trading and Education at Charles Schwab. ""We did see net selling on a dollar basis, which was particularly pronounced among the Information Technology, Communication Services and Financials sectors, but from an activity perspective, our clients bought more equities than they sold. It’s possible this is a sign of continued optimism into the new year, with virtually all economic indicators painting a rosier picture than in many recent months.""', 'U.S. equity markets continued a rally during the December STAX period as traders and investors positioned for a ""Santa Claus Rally"" into the year’s end. Economic data supported the rally; the U.S. Bureau of Labor and Statistics released its Employment Situation Summary on December 8, which showed that nonfarm payrolls increased by 199,000 in November, which was better than expected. The U.S. unemployment rate decreased slightly to 3.7%. On December 12, the Consumer Price Index (CPI) for the month of November rose by 0.1% to 3.1% year-over-year, further easing inflation fears. In a December 13 press conference, U.S. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell remarked that tight monetary policy was having the intended effect of reducing inflation, and that the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) had begun discussions around potential cuts to the Federal Funds Rate in 2024. This was perceived as a dovish surprise and a major pivot from the Fed’s ""higher for longer"" messaging of just weeks prior and fueled a steep decline in the yield on the 10 Year Treasury Note, which fell to 3.88%.', 'During the December STAX period, the S&P 500 (SPX) continued an ascent, rising by 4.62% to close at 4769.83. The CBOE Volatility Index (VIX) was virtually unchanged and remained near its yearly lows. Treasury yields plummeted, with the 10-year yield ending the period below 3.9%, and the U.S. Dollar Index also finished near multi-month lows. Crude oil continued its recent decline with February futures contracts settling at $71.65 per barrel.', 'Popular names bought by Schwab clients during the period included:', 'Pfizer Inc.

(AAPL)', 'Meta Platforms Inc. (META)', 'Tesla Inc. (TSLA)', 'Block Inc. (SQ)', 'Home Depot Inc. (HD)', '2023 in Review', 'The STAX ended 2022 at its lowest level since April 2020 but began 2023 with three consecutive months of increasing scores. A resurgent tech trade driven by hype around increased investment into artificial intelligence bolstered sentiment. April saw the first decline in the STAX for 2023 as uncertainty surrounding the health of the banking system dampened sentiment. The STAX bounced back sharply to close out the second quarter, finishing at 46.76 in June, its highest level in over a year. Equities continued to rally throughout much of the summer, and the STAX reached 48.08 in August, its highest level of 2023. Interest rates rose dramatically throughout the fall months, pressuring equities. The STAX posted three straight monthly declines before bouncing back in December to end the year at 44.56 after a dovish pivot from the Federal Reserve sent equites near all-time highs.', 'About the STAX', 'The STAX value is calculated based on a complex proprietary formula. Each month, Schwab pulls a sample from its client base of funded accounts, which includes accounts that completed a trade in the past month. The holdings and positions of this statistically significant sample are evaluated to calculate individual scores, and the median of those scores represents the monthly STAX.', 'For more information on the Schwab Trading Activity Index, please visit www.schwab.com/investment-research/stax.

We are webcasting today's conference call live. Thank you for your interest in Acuity Brands. I will now turn the call over to Neil Ashe."", ""Neil M. Ashe: Thank you, Charlotte and thanks to all of you for joining us this morning. We continue to demonstrate strong execution in our fiscal 2024 first quarter. We increased our adjusted operating profit, our adjusted operating profit margin, and our adjusted diluted earnings per share. We generated significant free cash flow and we allocated capital effectively to drive value. Both our Lighting and our Intelligent Spaces businesses continued to perform well during the quarter. Particularly in ABL our performance was excellent. We increased adjusted operating profit by $15 million on $71 million less sales, and increased the adjusted operating profit margin 280 basis points to 17.5%. Our strategy is yielding results. We're increasing product vitality, elevating service levels, using technology to improve and differentiate both our products and how we operate the business, and we are driving productivity."", 'Today, our products are perceived as being more valuable in the marketplace at the same time, we are lowering costs. Our product vitality efforts are the combination of new product introductions and improvements to our existing portfolio to ensure that our products are more valuable to our customers and more profitable for us. Our Contractor Select portfolio is about 300 of our most popular products. They are used in common everyday lighting applications and are in stock at retailers and electrical distributors. We continue to invest in product vitality and we have expanded our Lithonia Lighting ESXF floodlight family. This is a better product for distributors because it allows them to carry less inventory and is better for contractors because it is easier to install.', 'This product family was first introduced in 2022 to offer a uniform lighting solution for parking lots, walkways, and outer buildings. It uses switchable technology to provide installers 36 on site options, including lumen output, color temperature, photocell, and mounting options. Our Design Select portfolio consists of configurable product options that meet the key choices of lighting specifiers with high levels of service. This quarter, we added additional products in our down lighting, panel, emergency lighting, and outdoor categories. As we expand the options available in this portfolio, our focus is on product vitality and making it easier for the specification community to choose superior solutions. Our efforts to elevate service are having a positive impact on our customers.', ""In October, we were once again recognized by the voters of IMARK Electrical as one of the suppliers of the year for 2023. We also continue to invest in productivity improvements in our operations. Earlier this quarter, we traveled with a group of associates to our Mexican manufacturing facilities to open our new state of the art Santa Rosa production facility, which includes our highly efficient new paint line. This facility embraces technology to deliver a better product to our customers and improves the efficiency of the paint line process, while also reducing the environmental impact. I'd like to highlight a couple of ways we're doing this. Our paint guns and torque guns in our new facility are powered by a high efficiency air compressor that aims to reduce approximately half of our CO2 generation compared to the air compressor from our previous paint line."", 'High efficiency walls, burners, and booster technology in our ovens require less gas than similar systems and use around 40% less natural gas than our previous infrared ovens. The transition to this facility has been seamless. We relocated an existing facility to the new SPF facility without any service interruption, and now have capacity available for future growth. Our combined paint and natural gas savings are delivering on our required financial return for the facility, while also meeting our sustainability objectives. You can learn more about this project and other accomplishments in our recently released Earth Light Report, valuable on our ESG for investors page on our Investor Relations website. Now moving to our Spaces Group. Our mission in our intelligent spaces business is to make spaces smarter, safer, and greener through a strategy of connecting the edge to the cloud.', 'This tech has the best edge control devices on the market, while Atrius will be the best in cloud applications. At Distech, we are focused on expanding our addressable market in two ways. The first is geographic, and the second is increasing what we control in a built space. This quarter, we continued our geographic expansion, adding several new system integrators in the UK, Asia and Australia. In one of our original markets, France our hard work is paying off. The Building Services, Research and Information Association called out Distech as dominating the French building, automation, and control systems market in a newly released report. We also continue to increase what we can control in a build space. In October, we launched our Distech Reset [ph] Move Sensor at several industry conferences in Europe.', 'This is an advanced 7 in 1 ceiling mounted sensor that is able to detect occupancy in spaces. It counts the number of people using a space, providing feedback on occupancy requirements to the building users. It is AI powered and can be used to optimize indoor air quality, reduce energy and cleaning costs, and enhance occupancy comfort. It will be revealed to our North American and international customers at the AAHR Expo in Chicago later this month. Our expansion into refrigeration controls is also going well with the integration of KE2 Therm on track and performing as we expect it. During the quarter, we released the KE2 Therm Edge manager with a back net communication stack. This is the same open protocol technology that is used by Distech, and is an important step to ensure compatibility between both the Distech edge controllers and the KE2 Therm edge controllers.', ""Now turning to our outlook. The changes that we have made to the business are impactful and long lasting. Our order rates are growing both year-over-year and sequentially. We're back to typical lead times, and absent the excess backlog from last year, we would be experiencing sales growth. We are focused on controlling what we can control, and we are confident our execution will continue. In our Lighting and Lighting Controls business, we will continue to focus on delivering margin and cash flow. In our Spaces Group, we will continue to grow geographically and by adding to what we can control in a build space. We're delivering applications that are making a difference. Now I'll turn the call over to Karen, who will update you on our first quarter performance."", 'Karen J. Holcom: Thank you Neil and good morning to everyone on the call. We started the year with strong performance. We increased our adjusted operating profit by $14 million year-over-year, improved our adjusted operating profit margin by 250 basis points over the prior year, and by 40 basis points sequentially. We increased our adjusted diluted earnings per share by $0.43 year-over-year and generated cash flow from operations of $190 million. We continue to improve our businesses and allocated capital effectively. For total AYI, we generated net sales in the first quarter of $935 million, which was $63 million or 6% lower than the prior year as a result of the lower net sales in our ABL business. This was partially offset by continued growth in the ISG business of 13% in the quarter.', 'We continue to deliver year-over-year margin improvement. During the quarter, our adjusted operating profit increased by $14 million on lower sales, while we expanded adjusted operating profit margin to 16.5%, an increase of approximately 250 basis points from the prior year. This increase was driven largely by the significant year-over-year improvement in our gross profit margin as we continued to execute and drive margin through product vitality, the management of price and cost, and productivity improvements. During the quarter, our adjusted diluted earnings per share of $3.72 increased $0.43 or 13% over the prior year, primarily as a result of higher net income and to a lesser extent, lower shares outstanding due to the share repurchases.', ""In ABL, net sales were $876 million in the quarter, a decrease of around 7% compared with the prior year, driven by declines across most of our channels, offset slightly by continued strong performance in our retail channel. Sales growth in ABL this quarter had a challenging year-over-year comparison as the results in the first quarter of fiscal 2023 benefited from working down an elevated level of backlog. ABL's adjusted operating profit increased 11% to $154 million on lower net sales and we delivered adjusted operating profit margin of 17.5%, a 280 basis point improvement over the prior year. ISG's net sales for the first quarter were $64 million, an increase of 13% as Distech continued to grow and KE2 Therm performed as we expected. ISG's adjusted operating profit was $10 million."", 'Now turning to our cash flow performance. We generated $190 million of cash flow from operating activities for the first quarter of fiscal 2024, an increase of $3 million over the prior year, primarily due to an improvement in net income partially offset by a decrease in cash flow from working capital. During the first quarter of fiscal 2024, we continued to allocate capital consistent with our priorities. We invested $15 million in capital expenditures and allocated approximately $50 million to repurchase around 300,000 shares. Since the beginning of the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020, we have repurchased over 9 million shares at an average price of about $143 per share, which was funded by organic cash flow. To wrap up, we had a strong quarter, particularly in ABL.', 'We continued to deliver strong margin and cash flow performance. We grew adjusted operating profit and improved adjusted operating profit margin. We increased adjusted diluted earnings per share, generated strong cash flow from operations, and allocated capital effectively. We are pleased with our performance, and we will reevaluate the outlook at the midpoint of the year. Thank you for joining us today. I will now pass you over to the operator to take your questions.', ""Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from the line of Joe O'Dea with Wells Fargo.

The company’s quarterly revenues are expected to have improved year over year, while earnings are projected to have declined.', 'In the last reported quarter, USB’s earnings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate on higher expenses. Results benefited from increased net interest income (NII), supported by higher interest rates. A rise in non-interest income was another positive. However, higher expenses and provisions were the major headwinds.', 'U.S. Bancorp has a strong surprise history. Earnings surpassed estimates in the three of the trailing four quarters and missed once, the average beat being 2.71%.', '\xa0', 'U.S. Bancorp price-eps-surprise | U.S. Bancorp Quote', 'The Zacks Consensus Estimate for\xa0fourth-quarter earnings\xa0of 99 cents has been unchanged in the past month.

Management projects adjusted total revenues between $6.8 billion and $6.9 billion. The outlook includes purchase accounting accretion of $65 million.', 'Loan Demand & NII: Given the challenging macroeconomic backdrop and high interest rates, banks’ lending activities are likely to have been muted in the fourth quarter. Per the Fed’s latest\xa0data, the overall lending scenario was weak. The demand for commercial and industrial, real estate and consumer loans (except credit card loans) was subdued in October and November.', ""Given U.S. Bancorp's substantial exposure to commercial and real estate loans, the company’s lending book is likely to have been affected."", 'Hence, moderate loan demand is likely to have negatively influenced USB’s average earning asset balance for the fourth quarter. Notably, the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $600.7 billion for average earning assets indicates a marginal sequential decrease.', 'Though the Federal Reserve did not raise rates in the quarter, the policy rate stands at a 22-year high of 5.25-5.5% at present. Such high rates are likely to have a positive impact on the company’s NII.', 'However, an inverted yield curve, deposit migrations and higher funding costs are expected to weigh on NII and margins.', 'The consensus estimate for NII (taxable-equivalent basis) suggests a 2.8% sequential tumble to $4.14 billion. The company projects NII (taxable-equivalent basis) of $4.1-$4.2 billion.', 'Non-Interest Income: Market volatility and client activity were subdued in the fourth quarter. While the risks of a recession in the near term faded, ambiguity related to geopolitical issues, inflation and high rates kept investors on the sidelines. These factors led to reduced volatility in equity markets and other asset classes, including commodities, bonds and foreign exchange.', 'Hence, USB is likely to have recorded a weak performance in trading revenues this time. This is expected to have hindered commercial product revenues.', 'The Zacks Consensus Estimate for commercial products revenues is pegged at $345 million, suggesting a 1.6% sequential fall.', 'In the fourth quarter, mortgage rates continued to increase, with the rate on 30-year fixed mortgage reaching 7.31% in September, the\xa0highest level in nearly 23 years. The climb in mortgage rates, which kept home buyers on the sidelines, led to a smaller origination market, both purchase and refinancing, than the prior-year quarter.', 'Hence, U.S. Bancorp is likely to have continued seeing declines in its home lending portfolio and mortgage banking revenues in fourth-quarter 2023. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for USB’s fourth-quarter 2023 mortgage banking revenues is pegged at $140 million, implying a 2.8% fall sequentially.', 'The Zacks Consensus Estimate for income from card fees is pegged at $411 million, indicating a marginal decline from the prior quarter’s reported figure. Nonetheless, the consensus mark for trust and investment management fees is pegged at $624 million, indicating a sequential rise of 0.4%.', 'Overall, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for total non-interest income is pegged at $2.69 billion, implying a decline of 2.3% on a sequential basis.', 'Expenses: As USB continues to invest in digital initiatives, payment capabilities and technology modernization, such costs are likely to have weighed on its expense base to some extent in the to-be-reported quarter. Moreover, higher merger and integration costs, and the negative impacts of MUFG Union Bank’s operating expenses are expected to have increased expenditure. The company anticipates merger and integration charges between $250 million and $300 million.', 'U.S. Bancorp estimates adjusted non-interest expenses of $4.2 billion. The guidance includes core deposit intangibles amortization related to the Union Bank acquisition of $115 million.Asset Quality: With an uncertain macroeconomic outlook and slower GDP growth, USB’s credit quality is likely to have deteriorated.

Although they are on opposite spectrums regarding battery production, EnerSys is a very reputable company in its own right with its products marketed to customers in over 100 countries.', ""The reasoning for the loose narrative with Energizer is that certainly many consumers and perhaps some investors may not know the name EnerSys but they understand that battery production is critical to many markets. Operating on a much larger scale in terms of industrial battery production, EnerSys' reach extends to applications in different markets as well such as aerospace, defense, and medical industries."", ""The revenue chart above is very impressive but it is EnerSys' probability and future earnings potential that makes its stock most compelling. EnerSys' annual earnings are expected to soar 54% in FY24 to $8.23 per share compared to $5.34 a share last year. Plus, EnerSys' FY25 EPS is expected to expand another 8% to $8.91 per share.

Notably, FY25 sales projections would represent 27% growth over the last five years with EnerSys' EPS growth slated at 98% during this period as annual earnings were at $4.49 a share in 2021."", ""EnerSys' price performance has correlated with its strong earnings outlook with ENS shares rising +25% over the last year which has topped the S&P 500's +20% and its Zacks Subindustry's +15%.

With these two battery makers being a perfect example within their respective industries, earnings estimate revisions for EnerSys are nicely up in the last 30 days for both FY24 and FY25 while Energizer's EPS revisions have remained unchanged over the last month but are still noticeably lower over the last 60 days."", ""EnerSys' expansive bottom line has made it one of the most intriguing growth stocks to watch at the beginning of the year.

Several concerns, including lingering geopolitical tensions, inflation concerns, higher interest rates and China's economic slowdown, weighed on deal-making. Thus, the deal volume and total value numbers were weak in the fourth quarter."", ""Likewise, the IPO market was subdued after witnessing considerable activity in the third quarter. On the other hand, robust equity market performance drove some activity in follow-up equity issuances.

The company will outperform the industry on IB fees in the quarter.

According to the retailer, no U.S. company has offered drone delivery to as many households in a single market.', 'The expansion adds stores in 30 towns and municipalities to Walmart’s existing Dallas-Fort Worth service, which itself is part of a network spanning nearly 40 hubs in seven states.', 'Zipline and Wing, both of which were recently approved by the Federal Aviation Administration to fly drones beyond the visual line of sight (BVLOS) of an observer, will power the deliveries. The companies’ new permissions — part of an FAA push to grow the industry within the U.S. — will allow them to fly farther than previously permitted.', '“Customers will have access to a broad assortment of items from Walmart available for delivery to their home in just minutes,” said Prathibha Rajashekhar, senior vice president of innovation and automation for Walmart U.S. “Drone delivery is not just a concept of the future; it’s happening now and will soon be a reality for millions of additional Texans.”', 'Walmart said Dallas-Fort Worth customers can expect the buzzing aircraft to arrive in as little as 10 minutes but no more than 30. Across two years of trials, the retailer has completed more than 20,000 deliveries of items such as snacks, beverages and cold medicines, including fragile cargo such as eggs. Thousands of items are eligible for drone delivery, but customers must be within 10 miles of a store offering the service.', 'With the expansion, Dallas-Fort Worth is shaping up to be Walmart’s largest U.S. drone delivery market initially. But the retailer has an additional 4,700 stores located within 10 miles of 90% of the U.S. population, adding plenty of room for scale when the time comes.', 'Zipline, which has worked with Walmart since 2021, is actually the world’s largest drone delivery provider by sheer volume. The company has flown more than 60 million commercial miles, completing 880,000 deliveries in the process. Wing, which ranks second on the list, has made about 350,000 deliveries, according to its website.', 'Tuesday’s announcement added more food and convenience delivery to Zipline’s profile, which largely consists of medical shipments of blood, vaccines and other critical cargo. The company said the expansion will allow it to serve 1,000 times as many Walmart customers. For the past two years, it’s delivered from a store in Arkansas, where it says customers now perceive operations as “totally normal.”', 'By the time Zipline and Walmart begin an operational pilot later this year, the company expects to have completed tens of thousands of trials with Platform 2 (P2), its next-generation delivery system.', 'Among other things, P2 will introduce a modified drone, docking, charging and delivery infrastructure for businesses, and an autonomous droid capable of guiding packages to spaces as small as a patio table. It aims to automate more tasks for customers and enable more precise drop-offs than the company’s existing system, which uses a parachute.', 'P2 is expected to roll out across the U.S. this year — including in Dallas-Fort Worth following pilot flights with Walmart.', '“Autonomous delivery is finally ready for national scale in the U.S.” said Keller Rinaudo Cliffton, co-founder and CEO of Zipline. “Zipline is excited to enable Walmart’s vision of providing customer delivery so fast it feels like teleportation. … We’re excited for folks across Dallas-Fort Worth to experience delivery that is seven times as fast, zero emissions and whisper-quiet.”', 'Like Zipline, Wing, a subsidiary of Google parent Alphabet, has spent the past few years developing its U.S. network with Walmart.', 'The company has four years of commercial residential service under its belt, including more than a year and a half in DFW. Those operations recently ramped up with deliveries out of two Walmart Supercenters in the suburbs of Frisco and Lewisville, reaching a combined 60,000 households. Wing expects its next expansion to be completed within the year, adding “millions” of customers.', 'After four months of service in Dallas-Fort Worth with Walmart, customers have been clamoring for more, with the top 25% of customers ordering twice per week on average, Wing said. Sustainability is a value proposition to customers, but so is speed — the company’s drones typically spend just five minutes in the air during a delivery.', 'Now, range could become a selling point. With its recent FAA approval, Wing can expand its delivery zone beyond the previously enforced 6-mile radius. That means each of its delivery sites will be able to reach more customers.', '“Our first few months delivering to Walmart customers have made it clear: Demand for drone delivery is real,” said Wing CEO Adam Woodworth. “The response has been incredible from customers ordering drone delivery from Walmart every day, and it’s a testament to our partnership that we’re now expanding our footprint to bring this innovative delivery option to millions of Texans. If this milestone is any indication, we believe 2024 is the year of drone delivery.”', 'Zipline and Wing were among the first U.S. firms to receive FAA Part 135 air carrier approval, which allows them to fly drones commercially. Only five companies in the space have those permissions, the others being Amazon Prime Air, UPS Flight Forward and Causey Aviation Unmanned, the partner of another Walmart collaborator, Israeli manufacturer Flytrex.', 'Drone delivery has not quite reached the mass adoption phase. But with Walmart’s massive expansion, that point is beginning to enter focus.', 'The key to scale will be the finalization of drone delivery regulations, which are still being developed. The FAA, for example, has proposed final rules for BVLOS operations and is coordinating with industry stakeholders to get it on the books. Until that happens, companies will need to rely on waivers like Zipline’s or Wing’s to start flying.', 'Those early operations — Walmart’s among them — will help the FAA learn what restrictions may need to be added, removed or modified. In the meantime, less established competitors will continue to languish under heavy limitations. But the hope is that Walmart, Zipline and Wing can give the FAA the confidence to open things up for the rest of the industry.', 'The post Walmart adds 1.8M homes to Dallas-Fort Worth drone delivery service appeared first on FreightWaves.']"

But investments in technology and automation mean even those occupations seems to be on the decline, based on the latest jobs data.', 'More from Sourcing Journal', ""Outlook '24: The 'Year of the Commitment' for AI"", 'No Injuries Reported in Brazil Cotton Warehouse Fire', 'SPESA Picks LA for Next Advancements in Manufacturing Technologies Conference', 'Total nonfarm payroll employment rose by 216,000 in December, the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) reported Friday. Retail trade employment rose 17,000, reflecting little change from the prior month. Employment rose 14,000 in warehouse clubs, supercenters and other general merchandise retailers. But these gains were partially offset by a 13,000-job decline in the department store channel.', 'The 23,000 transportation and warehousing jobs lost are particularly troubling. While couriers and messengers lost 32,000 jobs in December, air transportation added 4,000 positions. But from a big picture point-of-view, the BLS data shows that since peaking in October 2022, employment in transportation and warehousing is down by 100,000 jobs.', 'Some of the warehousing job gains post-Covid came from supply chain disruptions that upended retail inventory as merchants fought to navigate those headwinds. Companies ramped up hiring in warehouses and distribution centers (DCs) and for other in-house logistics positions to bypass hiring outside third-party services. BLS data indicates that while apparel and accessories retailers shed 9,000 positions in May 2022, transportation and warehousing expanded by 47,000. Employment in warehousing alone rose by 18,000.', 'Walmart added 20,000 workers in 2021, with most of those jobs in logistics and supply chain roles. Dollar General also increased its workforce that fall, even after hiring over 50,000 employees by mid-summer.', 'But Walmart has sunk millions into technology and supply chain automation to gain a fulfillment edge and boost margins. Nine regional DCs servicing U.S. stores have varying levels of automation. And its third next-generation e-commerce fulfillment center opened last October in Lancaster, Texas, a 1.5-million-square-foot facility that should more than double both the storage capacity and number of customer orders fulfilled daily. Another is being built in Stockton, Calif., which should become operational in 2026 and expand the discounter’s next- and two-day shipping to nearly 90 percent of the U.S. These centers will help some Walmart associates transition into higher-skilled, tech-focused positions. At the end of December, Walmart was on track to add parcel stations to 40 stores and expedite last-mile delivery.', 'But by last April, Walmart began laying off more than 2,000 warehouse employees in five U.S. states, with more projected. A Walmart spokeswoman told SJ the “adjusted staffing levels” at some fulfillment centers address “the future needs of customers.”', 'Last May when April’s labor data showed flat U.S. retail job growth, The Conference Board’s senior economist Selcuk Eren said information services, transportation and warehousing and construction faced the greatest risk of layoffs, according to the board’s proprietary Job Loss Risk Index projections. That means that as retailers reengineer their supply chain, they’ll need fewer warehouse workers. However, new jobs could offset some of the declines as retail innovation attacks other areas of the business.', 'Another factor is influencing job growth in warehousing: sagging consumer demand.', 'Chief economist Jack Kleinhenz of the National Retail Federation, a retail trade organization, said Tuesday that while consumers spent more than expected in 2023 despite high inflation and interest rates, there could be a spending slowdown this year.', '“A year ago, many commentators were skeptical and calling for a recession, but the recession never came. With each passing month, consumers kept spending despite inflation and higher borrowing costs,” Kleinhenz commented in the January issue of NRF’s Monthly Economic Review. “Nonetheless, those tailwinds are not necessarily sustainable.” Tight credit conditions, higher borrowing costs, and an expanding labor market could crimp spending.', 'Warehousing isn’t the only area of logistics where jobs are falling, with another digital freight brokerage, Uber Freight, reducing headcount.', 'FreightWaves first reported that roughly 40 to 50 jobs were cut Monday, with the Bay Area company confirming the layoffs to Sourcing Journal, but not the number of employees or departments impacted.', '“We made a strategic workforce adjustment aligned with our continued commitment to drive sustainable growth. Regrettably, this means a small reduction in force,” an Uber spokesperson said. “This decision, not made lightly, optimizes the team to enhance operational efficiency and long-term success. We deeply appreciate the contributions of all team members and are providing support for those affected. Our focus remains on delivering excellence to our customers and creating sustained value for our stakeholders.”', 'The report indicated that impacted employees received their separation agreements via email on Monday, hours before they were laid off via one-on-one Zoom calls.', 'In January 2023, the freight brokerage laid off 150 employees, or 3 percent of its workforce. The company cut about 50 employees in a second round of staff cuts six months later.', 'Logistics firms in 2023 started making the necessary adjustments for an expected slowdown by cutting jobs as revenues began to fall. Last November, shipping container giant A.P. Moller-Maersk said it was cutting 3,500 jobs as part of a plan to shed headcount by 10,000 and get the total number of workers down to 100,000. And U.S. railroad operator Union Pacific was expected to eliminate 280 positions, or 5 percent of its 5,600 management jobs. Union Pacific’s total workforce is around 33,000. The cuts follow the 1,500 positions shed at trucking marketplace Convoy, the 1,200 lost at Flexport and the 30,000 jobs eliminated that resulted from the bankruptcy and liquidation of trucking giant Yellow Corp.']"

They played an important role in the history of American retail and urbanization, and prior to department stores, retailers tended to sell narrow specialty and niche items. But what was once new is now old, and department stores are somewhat considered a relic of the past.

It was a mixed quarter for the company.\xa0Same store sales missed fairly meaningfully, leading to a revenue miss. On the other hand, gross margin was better than expectations and operating expenses were lower than expected though, allowing for operating profit and EPS to beat."", 'Dillard’s Chief Executive Officer William T. Dillard, II stated, “The sales environment remained challenging in the third quarter with particular weakness beginning in September. Our focus on producing profitable sales with inventory control paid off - with retail gross margin of 45.3% and inventory down 1% year over year. We repurchased $48 million of stock and had $893 million of cash and short-term investments remaining.”', ""Dillard's scored the fastest revenue growth of the whole group.

Setting the tone for this new standard of benefits engagement is Generation Z – who, according to MetLife's 21st annual U.S. Employee Benefit Trends Study, are more likely to expect a tailored, year-round benefits experience than other employees. Sixty-eight percent of Gen Z employees want their employer to communicate with them after they have enrolled in benefits, not just during annual enrollment, the study found.1"", 'With the number of Gen Z employees in the workforce expected to surpass that of baby boomers in early 2024, employers will need to reevaluate their benefits strategies with an eye toward Gen Z’s expectations. MetLife’s study found that half of today’s Gen Z employees say most of the benefits communications they receive don’t feel relevant to them, and 63% wish their employers offered more personalized recommendations.2 This comes as Gen Z workers are also least likely to say that their benefits meet their evolving needs throughout their lives.', '""As employers across the U.S. plan their benefits strategies for the year, it’s vital for them to recognize the unique preferences of each generation,"" said Jamie Madden, Senior Vice President of Workforce Engagement and Benefits Connectivity at MetLife.

However, growth stocks tend to carry a lot of volatility -- and some investors may find it hard to stomach their frequent ebbs and flows.', 'Long-term investors understand that wealth is not built overnight. Identifying efficient businesses that are being managed by quality leadership teams is a great first step to building a strong portfolio. Furthermore, picking investments that deliver steady streams of dividend income can also be an underrated strategy.', 'One company that I think checks both of these boxes is Realty Income (NYSE: O). Scooping up some shares now could lay the foundation for lucrative long-term gains.', ""Realty Income is a real estate investment trust (REIT), and as such, it's required to pay out 90% of its taxable income to shareholders each year. For this reason, REITs tend to offer high dividend yields."", ""Among Realty Income's unusual features is that it pays its dividends on a monthly basis. And given the company's impressive streak of more than 100 consecutive quarters of dividend increases, it's easy to understand why investors may want to hold the stock for the long term."", ""Realty Income is a retail REIT, making its business susceptible to consumer shopping patterns. More specifically, the rise of e-commerce could be viewed as a threat to Realty Income's business. Additionally, given the macroeconomic headwinds of inflation and higher borrowing costs due to increased interest rates, many consumers have significantly cut back on their discretionary spending."", ""Some might be concerned that this could leave some of the retail chains that lease Realty Income's property struggling to cover their rent payments. While these points make sense on the surface, a deeper analysis of Realty Income's operation may alleviate these concerns."", ""Realty Income's tenants include downturn-resistant retail outlets such as Walgreens, Dollar General, and Dollar Tree, as well as big box discount retailers including Walmart and BJ's. There is an argument to be made that if the economy begins to slow down, those retailers could experience higher shopping volumes -- making Realty Income a business that could possibly benefit in this situation too."", ""Another key performance indicator to look at for REITs is occupancy rate -- the percentage of rentable space that is filled with tenants. As of the end of the third quarter, Realty Income's occupancy rate was 98.8%. Going back to the Great Recession between 2008 and 2009, Realty Income's occupancy rate hovered around 97%. I see this as a decent proxy for the company's strength during challenging economic periods."", ""As of the time of this writing, Realty Income stock trades at a price-to-book (P/B) ratio of 1.4 -- well below its 10-year average of 2. My hunch is that some investors have soured on Realty Income given the company's exposure to policies that can meaningfully impact that macro economy."", 'Keep in mind, office REITs are suffering from the aftereffects of the\xa0 pandemic and the expansion of remote work that it led to. Nevertheless, Realty Income is an entirely different business with its own set of risks and potential catalysts. For this reason, I view the sell-off in its stock as shortsighted.', 'The chart above illustrates the total return of a $1,000 investment in Realty Income stock since its initial public offering in 1994. With dividends reinvested, that $1,000 initial outlay would have grown into a position worth more than $50,000 today. Not only does this underscore the power of compounding, but it also highlights the contribution of its monthly dividends.', 'With the stock trading at bargain valuation levels, I think now is a terrific opportunity to scoop up some shares.', 'Should you invest $1,000 in Realty Income right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Realty Income, consider this:', ""The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Realty Income wasn't one of them.

However, analysts don’t all agree, and some of them are actually bearish on Salesforce. I am neutral on CRM stock because, when all is said and done, I like the company but am concerned about the elevated share price.', 'Salesforce specializes in customer relations management (CRM) software for businesses. The company, like practically every other large-cap software company in America, is now emphasizing its use of artificial intelligence (AI).', 'Consequently, while CRM stock isn’t a “Magnificent Seven” stock, it still rallied sharply last year. It’s always possible for the momentum to continue, but prospective investors should take note of both the bullish and the bearish arguments. Then, they need to think about Salesforce’s valuation, as it could be a major issue this year.', 'It’s not difficult to see why some folks are enthused about Salesforce right now. For instance, momentum-focused traders will undoubtedly like Salesforce stock’s performance in 2023. Amazingly, the stock zoomed from $140 to $250 in just 12 months.', 'When a stock rallies sharply like this, analysts typically raise their price targets because they practically have no choice. In the case of CRM stock, maintaining a $140 or $150 price target wouldn’t make sense anymore.', 'So, it makes sense that Baird analyst Robert Oliver would hike his Salesforce stock price target from $240 to $300. The Baird analyst also upgraded Salesforce from a Neutral rating to an Outperform rating, citing Salesforce’s price increases and the company’s push to deliver on margins.', '$300 isn’t an extremely high price target for Salesforce stock, so I won’t disagree with it. In contrast, Morgan Stanley (NYSE:MS) analyst Keith Weiss upgraded Salesforce shares from Equal Weight (Hold-rating equivalent) to Overweight (Buy-rating equivalent) and raised his price target on the stock from $290 to a highly ambitious $350.', 'Like the Baird analysts, Weiss cited product price hikes. Specifically, Weiss stated, “Low investor expectations vs potential top-line upside drivers in price increases, product bundling and Data Cloud adoption frame an attractive risk/reward for CRM.”', 'Whether the risk/reward is “attractive” for Salesforce stock is debatable, but I’ll get to that in a moment. Before I veer away from the bull case, I should also mention that Salesforce has an arrangement with the almighty Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), known as the Buy with Prime for Salesforce Commerce Cloud integration.', 'As TheFly summed up, this collaboration enables Salesforce’s merchants to integrate Amazon’s “Buy with Prime into their existing shopping experience.” It’s certainly worth considering as part of the bullish argument for CRM stock.', 'In opposition to momentum-focused traders, value investors might take issue with last year’s supersized rally in Salesforce stock. After all, a company’s price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio can become alarmingly high when a stock goes from $140 to $250.', 'When it comes to Salesforce, the Baird analyst referred to the company’s margins, but Wells Fargo (NYSE:WFC) analyst Michael Turrin feels that Salesforce has already “captured much of the value from its margin expansion story.” Hence, Turrin lowered his rating on CRM stock from Overweight to Equal Weight and chose not to raise his $280 price target on the shares.', 'In addition, I should mention that investment research firm Bernstein raised its price target on Salesforce stock from $159 to $212, which is still quite bearish, and reiterated its Underperform rating on Salesforce shares. Bernstein, according to TheFly, sees “only modest acceleration in IT spend growth and possibly softer growth in software segment growth” for Salesforce.', 'Finally, I must address the elephant in the room — Salesforce’s valuation, as measured by the company’s GAAP-measured trailing 12-month P/E ratio of 100.5x. For comparison, the sector median P/E ratio is 27.5x.', 'On TipRanks, CRM comes in as a Moderate Buy based on\xa026 Buys,\xa011 Holds, and\xa0one Sell rating assigned by analysts in the past three months. The average Salesforce stock price target is $281.57, implying 4.8% upside potential.', 'If you’re wondering which analyst you should follow if you want to buy and sell CRM stock, the most profitable analyst covering the stock (on a one-year timeframe) is\xa0Keith Bachman of BMO Capital, with an average return of 22.56% per rating and an 85% success rate. Click on the image below to learn more.', 'Salesforce’s margin expansion is worth monitoring, but it’s definitely possible that the market already priced in Salesforce’s margin growth for 2023 and even for 2024. Also, while Weiss might see “low investor expectations” for Salesforce, I’m seeing overstated investor expectations as expressed in the company’s P/E ratio.', 'Don’t get the wrong idea. Salesforce is a good company with an AI connection, and there’s no denying that Salesforce has had a great earnings track record. All in all, I just want to see CRM stock pull back 10% or even 20% before I can feel comfortable with Salesforce’s valuation, so I am not considering the stock at its current price.', 'Disclosure']"

Despite being Wood's third-largest holding across all of her exchange-traded funds (ETFs), UiPath is still relatively unknown."", ""The company specializes in a technology called robotics processing automation (RPA). Essentially, UiPath's software is meant to help office workers streamline repetitive tasks. For example, filling out loan applications at a bank or certain sections of legal documentation can be time-consuming. As such, UiPath can help automate these tasks and increase workplace productivity."", 'Workplace-productivity software has many different applications, including team collaboration, project management, or customer relationship management (CRM). While larger enterprises such as Atlassian, Microsoft, and Salesforce all offer a host of automation tools, there is a rising number of emerging solutions looking to take on big tech -- and for good reason. Revenue from productivity tools is expected to reach $88 billion by 2028 -- up from $79 billion forecasted for this year, according to Statista.', ""Per Gartner's latest research, UiPath is among the top leaders of RPA software. In fact, the company is seen to offer solutions superior to Salesforce and is ranked right on par with Microsoft. While this is nice on the surface, a look at UiPath's financial and operating results sheds more light on the company's momentum."", 'For the nine months ended Oct. 31, UiPath increased its revenue 20% year over year to $903 million. Moreover, as of the end of the third quarter, the company grew the number of customers paying at least $1 million by over 30%. Investors cheered these results, sending the stock up 95% last year.', 'Although the stock is hovering close to the high end of its 52-week range, it still trades more than 70% below all-time highs.', ""The role that generative AI can play in RPA technology is a big tailwind for UiPath. In a lot of ways, 2023 was more of an exploratory year for how AI fits into IT budgets. Now, as use cases around the technology begin to take shape, I see UiPath's automation software as an in-demand product, especially as remote work environments become the new norm, making productivity in the workplace even more of a priority."", ""Moreover, given the release of CoPilot -- Microsoft's latest workplace-productivity service -- I would not be surprised if UiPath becomes an acquisition target at some point.

Given the demand for automated solutions in the workplace, I think UiPath will keep up its momentum and continue performing at a high level. For this reason, the stock could very well land on the radar of more investors this year."", ""The second company on my list is voice-recognition platform SoundHound AI (NASDAQ: SOUN).

Some of the company's customers include car manufacturer Stellantis, semiconductor company Qualcomm, and restaurant-management business Toast."", ""While SoundHound AI's technology has broad reach and appeal, the stock hasn't been great for shareholders.

Should this occur, it's appropriate to think that the economy may experience some rejuvenated activity from businesses and consumers alike. As purchasing power theoretically increases, the restaurant and automotive industries, among others, could witness some new life. Given those are two of SoundHound AI's core end markets, the company could find itself in a unique position to benefit and begin offsetting its burn rate."", 'Another reason why I am bullish on SoundHound AI this year is that I view the company as an acquisition target.

If you want to skip our discussion on the employment trends in the US, you can go directly to the 5 Companies With The Most Employees In The US.', 'The US labor market has experienced significant changes following the COVID-19 pandemic. In 2022, over 50 million employees chose to leave their jobs, building upon the 47.8 million resignations observed in 2021. The trend began to change in 2023, with a gradual decline, as 30.5 million workers resigned by August 2023. According to labor economists, the majority of individuals who resign from their jobs do so to pursue alternative opportunities rather than exiting the workforce entirely. This point is also reiterated by the fact that the rate of hiring has consistently exceeded the rate of resignations across most industries. For instance, while the leisure and hospitality industry lost 837 thousand employees in September last year, the sector also hired 1.1 million new individuals during the same month. The leisure and hospitality industry has consistently held the top position in hiring rates across all industries since November 2020, ranging from 6% to around 19%. This hiring pace surpasses the national average, which was recorded at 3.7% in September 2023.', 'The most recent jobs report from the Bureau of Labor Statistics indicates a significant increase in the active workforce, signaling a positive trend in employment. However, the current labor force participation falls short of pre-pandemic levels. If we were to match the labor force participation rate with the February 2020 benchmark, an additional 2.2 million individuals would be part of the workforce. This shortage is having a widespread impact across all industries and is noticeable in nearly every state. The education, health services, and professional and business services sectors currently have the highest number of job openings.

Most of the top 20 companies with the most employees in the US are featured on the Fortune 500 list and collectively employ over 10 million people in the US. This means these 20 companies contribute to employing over 6% of the total workforce, which stands at around 168 million as of December 2023. Some of the largest US companies by employee size are JPMorgan Chase & Co. (NYSE:JPM) and International Business Machines Corporation (NYSE:IBM). The companies employ 293,723 and 288,300 individuals, respectively. Overall, the federal government is the largest employer in the US. As of September 2023, approximately 2.95 million individuals were part of the US Federal workforce.', ""Here's what Vltava Fund said about JPMorgan Chase & Co. (NYSE:JPM) in its Q4 2023 investor letter:"", '""Last spring, the US went through a brief banking crisis that cost several smaller and medium-sized banks their lives. One of them, First Republic Bank, with assets of $230 billion, went into receivership and was bought out by the largest US bank, JPMorgan Chase & Co. (NYSE:JPM). The acquisition terms were very favourable for JPM and the facts that few, if any, other banks could have taken over the whole of First Republic Bank in its then-present state while guaranteeing more than $100 billion of its deposits played a role. JPM could do it. It is not only the largest, but also by its balance sheet the strongest US bank and, in our opinion, clearly the best managed. It has come out of this crisis even stronger. We have actively followed the banking sector for 20 years in many countries around the world. Our view is that a well-managed bank can be a very good long-term investment but that it is better to focus on the best and highest quality available. Banking is not a sector where it pays to trade quality for cheaper valuations.

Although the Dow Jones Industrial Average made headlines for streaking to a record high, it's the 43% gain for the Nasdaq Composite\xa0and the even more robust 54% increase in the Nasdaq-100 that really shined brightest. These gains demonstrate that investors' appetites for growth stocks and innovation is as strong as ever."", ""But just because the Nasdaq-100 was a standout index in 2023 doesn't mean all 101 of its components share the same outlook. (One company has two classes of shares, which is why there are 101 and not 100 components.) As we push ahead into 2024, two Nasdaq-100 stocks have separated themselves as exceptional buys, while another high-flying component with waning first-mover advantages is worth avoiding."", ""Though investors can probably find a handful of Nasdaq-100 stocks with a lower price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio, few offer a more attractive price-to-earnings-growth ratio (PEG ratio) than fintech leader PayPal Holdings (NASDAQ: PYPL). PayPal's stock finds itself roughly 80% below its all-time high."", 'This massive pullback is a function of two things: weaker gross margin, as competition in digital payments picks up, and concerns that a higher inflation rate would crimp the discretionary purchasing power of low-earning workers. PayPal is predominantly a fee-driven platform, so fewer transactions are expected to translate into lower gross profit.', ""While these are tangible worries, they're not overly concerning, given PayPal's continually improving key performance indicators, as well as the growth trajectory for digital payments. With regard to the latter, a 2023 report from Boston Consulting Group estimates that global fintech revenue can grow by more than 500% to $1.5 trillion by 2030."", ""But what's far more exciting than fintech's growth trajectory still being in the early innings is PayPal's steadily improving user-engagement statistics. In less than three years, the average active account on PayPal's digital networks went from completing fewer than 41 transactions on a trailing-12-month (TTM) basis to nearly 57 transactions over the TTM. More transactions should yield successively higher fees for PayPal and steadily grow its gross profit."", ""I'll add to the above that even with its active account growth stymied at the moment, total payment volume (TPV) traversing its networks has been increasing by a sustained double-digit percentage, without currency movements. When the U.S. and global economy are firing on all cylinders, annual TPV growth of 20% may be sustainable."", ""Getting back to the main point, PayPal's valuation makes a lot of sense for both growth and value seekers. Even though Wall Street's consensus is for PayPal to increase its earnings per share (EPS) by better than 18% on an annualized basis over the next five years, its shares can be purchased for just 11 times forward-year earnings. That's a PEG ratio of well below 1, which signifies what an incredible value PayPal is right now."", 'A second Nasdaq-100 stock that makes for a screaming buy in the new year is well-known coffee chain Starbucks (NASDAQ: SBUX).', ""The past couple of years have been challenging for Starbucks for two reasons. First, the COVID-19 pandemic required the company to adjust its operating model during a period of unpredictable store closures.

Starbucks ended fiscal 2023 (Starbucks' fiscal year closed on Oct. 1, 2023) with over 6,800 stores in China."", 'The other headwind for Starbucks has been inflation. While some degree of rising prices is expected, the biggest name in coffee dealt with rapidly rising labor costs (including unionization efforts at select stores) and a surge in the price of coffee. Higher operating costs have a way of squeezing margins.', ""But there's good news on this front. If there's one thing Starbucks possesses, it's exceptional pricing power. Saturating key markets in developed countries, coupled with its well-known brand, has enabled the company to increase its prices above and beyond the rate of inflation. In other words, inflation has actually served as a tailwind that's helped sustain a double-digit growth rate."", 'Another reason Starbucks has been practically unstoppable is the relatively steady expansion of its Rewards Membership program. The company closed out fiscal 2023 with 32.6 million active Rewards members, which is up 14% from the prior year. Rewards members spend more per ticket than non-Rewards customers and are also more likely to utilize mobile ordering, which shortens wait times in stores.', ""Perhaps the biggest change since the pandemic began that's really paid off for Starbucks is the revamping of its drive-thru experience. The company updated its ordering boards to include video of its baristas to make the experience more personal. Further, food and beverage pairings are now promoted to encourage the purchase of higher-margin items."", ""Starbucks also sports a historically attractive valuation. Shares can be purchased right now for less than 20 times forward-year earnings. That's lower than any point over the past decade and represents a 35% discount to its average forward-year earnings multiple over the previous five years."", ""While it played a key role in pushing the Nasdaq-100 higher by 54% in 2023, the one component I'd suggest steering clear of in 2024 is none other than North America's leading electric-vehicle (EV) manufacturer Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA)."", 'Shares of Tesla more than doubled last year, with increased EV production and the rollout of the Cybertruck fueling those gains. With regard to the former, Tesla set out to produce 1.8 million EVs in 2023 and achieved this mark with ease (1,845,985 EVs produced).', ""It also officially began deliveries of the Cybertruck on Nov. 30. With CEO Elon Musk previously noting that over 1 million $100 refundable deposits had been placed to secure a reservation for a Cybertruck, there's plenty of optimism that strong follow-through can lead to a big uptick in sales and profits. Tesla is working on its fourth consecutive year of generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) profit."", ""However, Tesla's outperformance last year in no way matches how the company has performed from an operating standpoint."", ""Despite having first-mover advantages in the EV space, Tesla kicked off a price war with other EV manufacturers in 2023. During the company's annual shareholder meeting in May, Musk concisely noted that Tesla's pricing strategy is dictated by demand for its vehicles. More than a half-dozen price cuts across Model's 3, S, X, and Y all but confirm that inventory levels are rising and competition is becoming a thorn in its side."", ""Although price cuts have been able to somewhat slow the pace by which Tesla's global vehicle inventory is increasing, these cost reductions are decimating the company's operating margin. Over the TTM period ended Sept. 30, Tesla's operating margin has been more than halved to 7.6% from 17.2%. This puts the company's operating margin on par with most legacy automakers."", ""Something else for investors to be concerned about is the risk of having Elon Musk as CEO. Despite successfully bringing a handful of EVs to market, Musk has a laundry list of promised innovations that have failed to materialize. If these unfulfilled promises are backed out of Tesla's valuation, it's my contention that shares could fall below $100 in 2024."", ""A forward-year earnings multiple of nearly 65 makes little sense for an auto stock with a plunging operating margin that's also generating a significant percentage of its pre-tax income from unsustainable sources."", 'Should you invest $1,000 in PayPal right now?', 'Before you buy stock in PayPal, consider this:', ""The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and PayPal wasn't one of them.

Even amid intense competition in the coffee shop business, Starbucks has many growth drivers it can pull to help its stock make new highs. Currently, SBUX’s average price target sits 15% shy of its all-time high. Still, if CEO Laxman Narasimhan can work his magic, I believe Starbucks has what it takes to return to glory, making me incredibly bullish on the stock after a forgettable 2023.', 'Indeed, Mr. Narasimhan took the helm at a pretty tough time for the Seattle-based coffee giant. The man has since risen to the occasion with new targets that could help Starbucks become a growth darling on Wall Street again. Though competition in the coffee scene has always been quite fierce, it’s grown even fiercer of late, with the likes of Dutch Bros. (NASDAQ:BROS) and even McDonald’s (NYSE:MCD) aggressively seeking to take a bigger share of the morning crowd.', 'Dutch Bros. and McDonald’s seem to view the drive-thru model as a means to eat into Starbucks’ moat. And with the rise of McDonald’s drive-thru-only concept, CosMc’s, which seems to be targeting consumers looking to get a quick (and cheap) caffeine and sugar fix, McDonald’s has arguably never looked this intimidating for Starbucks as its stock sails through some rough waters. That said, don’t count on red-hot rivals to impair Starbucks’ growth as it looks to fend off rivals with its premium brand.', 'Indeed, McDonald’s coffee doesn’t seem nearly as hot as the potential of McCafe and, now, CosMc’s. Over the near-to-medium term, CosMc’s is rolling out steadily, with just a handful of new stores launching in the Texas market. However, in 10 years from now, it’s unclear just how many CosMc’s locations there will be nationwide (there isn’t a set long-term expansion plan in place quite yet) and whether they’ll take a big bite into the market share of the likes of Starbucks.', 'In my prior piece, I noted that Starbucks shareholders had little to fear as McDonald’s looked to increase its market overlap with Starbucks.', 'Why? It all comes down to Starbucks’ premium brand. Though some Starbucks patrons may move over to CosMc’s for their morning brew due to lower prices, I’d argue most probably won’t. At the end of the day, a Starbucks cup is as much a status symbol as a pair of Louis Vuitton boots, at least in my opinion. And as good as McCafe coffee and baked goods are, McDonald’s just isn’t the upscale brand that’d resonate with Starbucks’ most hardcore fanatics.', 'Remember, there’s power to be had in brands, especially in the restaurant space. And under Mr. Narasimhan, I believe the Starbucks brand can be a source of explosive growth as the firm expands overseas.', 'Recently, Starbucks announced its intention to open 1,000 stores in India by 2028. Undoubtedly, India is a fast-growing economy with a middle class that could boom over the coming years. With an internationally recognized (and praised) brand, I have no doubt that Starbucks’ push into India will be nothing short of a ground-breaking success. Should the world economy heal sooner rather than later, I’d also not be surprised if the company decides to surpass its long-term target.', 'As Starbucks expands into India, it will also be busy growing its presence in the Chinese market, a tea-drinking nation with a newfound taste for coffee. In China, there are different rivals (think Luckin Coffee (OTC:LKNCY), which leap-frogged Starbucks to become China’s largest coffee firm) hungry for that morning crowd. But just like in the U.S., I believe no rival can outdo Starbucks.', 'As Starbucks gets more aggressive internationally, I think it will be tough for investors to ignore the long-term growth opportunity at hand. In the meantime, union headlines are going to hog the headlines. But don’t let it distract you from the impressive growth runway ahead of the firm.', 'In five years from now, count me as unsurprised if Starbucks automates more aspects of its business such that union woes become a thing of the past. And if Starbucks rolls out such automation technologies across stores around the world, the scale of longer-term margin growth could stand to be unprecedented.', 'On TipRanks, SBUX stock comes in as a Moderate Buy. Out of 19 analyst ratings, there are seven Buys and 12 Hold recommendations. The average SBUX stock price target\xa0is $109.78, implying upside potential of 18.1%. Analyst price targets range from a low of $98.00 per share to a high of $125.00 per share.', 'Laxman Narasimhan is a terrific CEO who’s about to make Starbucks stock hot again. From the Indian and Chinese market expansion opportunities to automation tech, the future of Starbucks has arguably never looked this bright.', 'Competitors are hungry for Starbucks’ morning crowd, but I think it will be tough to dethrone the Seattle-based coffee kingpin. As more investors appreciate the long-term narrative, expect SBUX stock to start warming up again, perhaps sooner rather than later.', 'Disclosure']"

If you want to skip our discussion on the employment trends in the US, you can go directly to the 5 Companies With The Most Employees In The US.', 'The US labor market has experienced significant changes following the COVID-19 pandemic. In 2022, over 50 million employees chose to leave their jobs, building upon the 47.8 million resignations observed in 2021. The trend began to change in 2023, with a gradual decline, as 30.5 million workers resigned by August 2023. According to labor economists, the majority of individuals who resign from their jobs do so to pursue alternative opportunities rather than exiting the workforce entirely. This point is also reiterated by the fact that the rate of hiring has consistently exceeded the rate of resignations across most industries. For instance, while the leisure and hospitality industry lost 837 thousand employees in September last year, the sector also hired 1.1 million new individuals during the same month. The leisure and hospitality industry has consistently held the top position in hiring rates across all industries since November 2020, ranging from 6% to around 19%. This hiring pace surpasses the national average, which was recorded at 3.7% in September 2023.', 'The most recent jobs report from the Bureau of Labor Statistics indicates a significant increase in the active workforce, signaling a positive trend in employment. However, the current labor force participation falls short of pre-pandemic levels. If we were to match the labor force participation rate with the February 2020 benchmark, an additional 2.2 million individuals would be part of the workforce. This shortage is having a widespread impact across all industries and is noticeable in nearly every state. The education, health services, and professional and business services sectors currently have the highest number of job openings.

One of them, First Republic Bank, with assets of $230 billion, went into receivership and was bought out by the largest US bank, JPMorgan Chase & Co. (NYSE:JPM). The acquisition terms were very favourable for JPM and the facts that few, if any, other banks could have taken over the whole of First Republic Bank in its then-present state while guaranteeing more than $100 billion of its deposits played a role. JPM could do it. It is not only the largest, but also by its balance sheet the strongest US bank and, in our opinion, clearly the best managed. It has come out of this crisis even stronger. We have actively followed the banking sector for 20 years in many countries around the world. Our view is that a well-managed bank can be a very good long-term investment but that it is better to focus on the best and highest quality available. Banking is not a sector where it pays to trade quality for cheaper valuations.

If you want to skip our discussion of eating disorders, their causes, and their effects on American society, you can go directly to the 5 States With Highest Rates of Eating Disorders.\xa0', ""Eating disorders are a group of illnesses that affect a person's relationship with food and body image. They are primarily mental illnesses that have been recognized by the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM) since the 1980s. The current edition of DSM recognizes eight categories of eating disorders. If you were wondering which mental illness has the highest mortality rate, it is Anorexia Nervosa. The disease causes a strong fear of gaining weight, and its patients resort to extreme exercise and calorie limitations. On the other hand, binge eating, which leads to several other diseases such as obesity and heart attack, also causes significant mortality indirectly.\xa0"", 'A significant portion of America has an eating disorder. According to the National Association of Anorexia Nervosa and Associated Disorders, almost 30 million Americans live with an eating disorder. If you live in America, there is a 9% chance that you will develop an eating disorder in your lifetime. However, this illness disproportionately affects women as they are twice as likely to develop an eating disorder compared to men. In fact, eating disorders are the third most common chronic illness in adolescent females.', 'Insurance data depicts an alarming situation regarding eating disorders. There has been a significant increase as the share of claim lines related to eating disorders among all claims increased by 65% between the years 2018 and 2022. However, it is worth noting that the majority of eating disorder claim lines as a percentage of total claim lines increased in the first year of the pandemic (2019 - 2020), during which it rose by 39%.\xa0', ""The worsening of America's eating disorder crisis during post-pandemic has triggered several state laws aimed at tackling the surge. Lawmakers across the country are proposing restrictions on social media algorithms to prevent them from promoting harmful content. These laws are specifically proposed to counteract anorexia, which according to the National Association of Anorexia Nervosa and Associated Disorders, claims 10,000 lives every year. The proposed restrictions also include preventing the sale of weight loss pills to minors. Other proposals include adding eating disorder prevention into the school curriculum.\xa0"", 'While anorexia is one of the most common eating disorders and claims the most lives, disorders such as binge eating and emotional eating are also a serious concern. The mortality rate of these disorders gets underreported as most of the time they contribute indirectly to death. Binge eating for several years, for example, can lead to cardiovascular disease, which is also a result of several other factors, such as lack of mobility and exercise.\xa0', ""The popularity and prevalence of fast food may be contributing to the eating disorder crisis in the country. Research has shown a positive correlation between fast-food consumption and eating disorder risk in teenagers. America has a thriving fast-food culture and is home to some of the most popular fast-food chains in the world. McDonald's Corporation (NYSE:MCD) is one of the largest fast-food chains. The restaurant chain has the highest number of franchises in the world. Up until recently, McDonald's Corporation (NYSE:MCD) was also the leading fast-food chain in terms of revenue, a title which now belongs to Starbucks Corporation (NASDAQ:SBUX), another American fast-food company. Starbucks Corporation (NASDAQ:SBUX), the largest fast food company in terms of revenue, earned $32.9 billion during 2022.

For each state, we totaled the rating for the five eating disorders and divided it by 5 to arrive at our own eating disorder score. The higher the score, the higher the rates of eating disorders in the state. The eating disorders we considered for our research were: anorexia, bigorexia, binge eating, body dysmorphia, and emotional eating.\xa0', 'By the way, Insider Monkey is an investing website that uses a consensus approach to identify the best stock picks of more than 900 hedge funds investing in US stocks.

Archeological studies suggest that the Maya people of Central America started using tobacco leaves as far back as the 1st century BC, mainly for smoking in sacred and religious ceremonies. By the time Columbus arrived in the New World in 1492, the Native Americans were already cultivating and smoking tobacco in pipes, cigars, and snuff. Although Cristopher Columbus brought with him a few tobacco leaves and seeds back to Europe, most Europeans didn't get their first taste of the plant until the mid-16th century, when adventurers and diplomats like France's Jean Nicot – for whom nicotine is named – began to popularize its use. Tobacco was introduced to France in 1556, Portugal in 1558, Spain in 1559, and finally England in 1565. By the early 17th century, smoking was common in all of Europe’s maritime nations, and their colonial empires soon carried tobacco all over the world."", 'According to Research and Markets, the global tobacco market is expected to reach $1.049 trillion by 2030, with a CAGR of 2.1% during the forecast period.

If you want to skip our discussion on the employment trends in the US, you can go directly to the 5 Companies With The Most Employees In The US.', 'The US labor market has experienced significant changes following the COVID-19 pandemic. In 2022, over 50 million employees chose to leave their jobs, building upon the 47.8 million resignations observed in 2021. The trend began to change in 2023, with a gradual decline, as 30.5 million workers resigned by August 2023. According to labor economists, the majority of individuals who resign from their jobs do so to pursue alternative opportunities rather than exiting the workforce entirely. This point is also reiterated by the fact that the rate of hiring has consistently exceeded the rate of resignations across most industries. For instance, while the leisure and hospitality industry lost 837 thousand employees in September last year, the sector also hired 1.1 million new individuals during the same month. The leisure and hospitality industry has consistently held the top position in hiring rates across all industries since November 2020, ranging from 6% to around 19%. This hiring pace surpasses the national average, which was recorded at 3.7% in September 2023.', 'The most recent jobs report from the Bureau of Labor Statistics indicates a significant increase in the active workforce, signaling a positive trend in employment. However, the current labor force participation falls short of pre-pandemic levels. If we were to match the labor force participation rate with the February 2020 benchmark, an additional 2.2 million individuals would be part of the workforce. This shortage is having a widespread impact across all industries and is noticeable in nearly every state. The education, health services, and professional and business services sectors currently have the highest number of job openings.

One of them, First Republic Bank, with assets of $230 billion, went into receivership and was bought out by the largest US bank, JPMorgan Chase & Co. (NYSE:JPM). The acquisition terms were very favourable for JPM and the facts that few, if any, other banks could have taken over the whole of First Republic Bank in its then-present state while guaranteeing more than $100 billion of its deposits played a role. JPM could do it. It is not only the largest, but also by its balance sheet the strongest US bank and, in our opinion, clearly the best managed. It has come out of this crisis even stronger. We have actively followed the banking sector for 20 years in many countries around the world. Our view is that a well-managed bank can be a very good long-term investment but that it is better to focus on the best and highest quality available.

Now, one of the world’s largest investment banks has shuttered the initiative, claiming it has fulfilled its goal and is now focusing its diversity efforts elsewhere.', 'The $1 billion pledge was a major statement for a bank that had taken a stand among its Wall Street peers on issues of diversity. In the same time period, the bank also announced it wouldn’t help companies go public without at least one diverse director on their boards. In both cases, Goldman cited a financial case for the decisions. Companies with at least one diverse board member performed better after listing, CEO David Solomon said. The goal of Launch With GS was to “generate strong investment returns,” then–chief strategy officer Stephanie Cohen wrote in a 2018 blog post announcing the program.', 'Goldman says it crossed a big milestone in June 2023: meeting its commitment to investing $1 billion in diverse-led companies. Yet there was no flashy announcement trumpeting the achievement. Goldman’s Launch With GS website was quietly updated in recent weeks to describe the initiative in the past tense and say that the bank deployed $1 billion to meet its goal. Much of that was within its asset and wealth management division. Launch With GS was responsible for “nearly 60 investments” over the past five years and ran five “entrepreneur cohorts” supporting 47 startups, Goldman tells Fortune. Recipients of Launch With GS–supported investments include the companies BentoBox, Billie, Burst Oral Care, and LeaseQuery as well as the funds Construct Capital, Define Ventures, and MaC Venture Capital.', 'Regina Green, a nearly 17-year Goldman veteran who became the head of Launch With GS in May 2021, announced on LinkedIn in the first week of 2024 that she was departing the firm. A handful of Goldman staffers who worked on Launch With GS were reassigned to other jobs. Cohen, the senior executive who championed Launch With GS at its beginning, has been on personal leave from Goldman since June 2023.', '“I’m so proud of the work we’ve done, the founders and managers we’ve partnered with, and the impact we’ve had so far,” Green wrote on LinkedIn in announcing her departure. She said that she eventually planned to continue to “partner with and invest in emerging managers funding innovative solutions for our most challenging problems.”', 'The bank is pivoting its focus to its One Million Black Women initiative, a 10-year pledge made in 2021 to provide $10 billion in investment capital (including more categories than venture-focused Launch With GS) and $100 million in philanthropic aid to address the “dual disproportionate gender and racial biases that Black women have faced for generations.” Goldman says it has deployed $2.3 billion toward that investment goal so far and has four team members dedicated to the program.', 'After Fortune contacted Goldman about the end of Launch With GS, the bank put forward Asahi Pompey, its global head of corporate engagement and foundation president, for an interview. She says that the strategies of Launch With GS are now integrated throughout the firm, especially its asset and wealth management division. “We have integrated the sourcing and ecosystem into our existing [asset and wealth management] business,” she says. “Our investors are always thinking opportunistically about finding fantastic investments … and we know that diverse companies outperform … Launch was a way to widen our aperture.”', 'She says that rather than celebrating hitting a goal with Launch With GS, the firm’s “focus is very much on the $8 billion that lies ahead of us” through its One Million Black Women program.', 'The end of Launch With GS’s journey from flashy launch to quiet sunsetting comes amid a period of tumult for the bank and for corporate diversity, equity, and inclusion programs more broadly. About 200 partners have left Goldman Sachs since Solomon took over, according to New York Magazine. The CEO has been criticized for extending Goldman too far beyond its core business.', 'Following the Supreme Court’s overturning of affirmative action, opponents of race-based funding and decision-making have started suing businesses that have publicly committed to such initiatives.

The Goldman Sachs Local Emerging Markets Debt A made its debut in February of 2008 and GAMDX has managed to accumulate roughly $2.79 million in assets, as of the most recently available information. The fund's current manager, Kay Haigh, has been in charge of the fund since July of 2020."", 'Performance', 'Of course, investors look for strong performance in funds. This fund carries a 5-year annualized total return of 0.29%, and is in the middle third among its category peers. Investors who prefer analyzing shorter time frames should look at its 3-year annualized total return of -3.54%, which places it in the middle third during this time-frame.', ""It is important to note that the product's returns may not reflect all its expenses. Any fees not reflected would lower the returns. Total returns do not reflect the fund's [%] sale charge. If sales charges were included, total returns would have been lower."", ""When looking at a fund's performance, it is also important to note the standard deviation of the returns. The lower the standard deviation, the less volatility the fund experiences. The standard deviation of GAMDX over the past three years is 10.55% compared to the category average of 13.86%. The standard deviation of the fund over the past 5 years is 12.55% compared to the category average of 14.62%. This makes the fund less volatile than its peers over the past half-decade."", 'With a beta of 0.39, this fund is less volatile than a broad market index of fixed income securities. Taking this into account, GAMDX has a positive alpha of 0.22, which measures performance on a risk-adjusted basis.', 'Expenses', 'Costs are increasingly important for mutual fund investing, and particularly as competition heats up in this market. And all things being equal, a lower cost product will outperform its otherwise identical counterpart, so taking a closer look at these metrics is key for investors. In terms of fees, GAMDX is a load fund. It has an expense ratio of 1.22% compared to the category average of 0.98%. Looking at the fund from a cost perspective, GAMDX is actually more expensive than its peers.', 'Investors need to be aware that with this product, the minimum initial investment is $1,000; each subsequent investment needs to be at least $50.', 'Fees charged by investment advisors have not been taken into considiration. Returns would be less if those were included.', 'Bottom Line', 'Overall, Goldman Sachs Local Emerging Markets Debt A ( GAMDX ) has a low Zacks Mutual Fund rank, and in conjunction with its comparatively similar performance, average downside risk, and higher fees, this fund looks like a somewhat weak choice for investors right now.', ""This could just be the start of your research on GAMDXin the Mutual Fund Bond category.

101,4e6e825e-b693-3102-a370-099f96d9ebff,NFLX,2024-01-12,A rare Netflix skeptic on Wall Street says it fails the grandmother test: The winner of the streaming wars will have to do too much to stay on top,Fortune,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/rare-netflix-skeptic-wall-street-100000967.html,1705053600,STORY,['NFLX'],"['Netflix continues to only compete against itself.', 'After being unofficially crowned the winner of the streaming wars, it now has to face a more daunting adversary: Wall Street expectations. Netflix has overcome much worse before in the recent past. Look no further than its disastrous earnings in April 2022, when it reported a decline in subscribers for the first time in 10 years and sparked a stock rout that wiped $50 billion off its market cap in a single day. That led at least nine firms to downgrade Netflix’s stock, only for it to be praised as the dominant streamer by the turn of this new year.', 'The Street is now singing Netflix’s praises, with BMO rating the stock an outperform, convinced that with the Hollywood strikes over, it will attract the best actors and writers in Hollywood. Bank of America called it a “long-term winner” in a year-end overview of the media industry published in December, while Goldman had it at neutral, seeing its position getting entrenched. But Jason Bazinet of Citi Research issued a downgrade, and as he told Fortune, Netflix’s story is going to get too complicated, especially if the company considers a big acquisition around its long-rumored interest in gaming.', '“If you can explain a story in two lines to your grandmother, that will get a higher multiple,” Bazinet tells Fortune. “As soon as you start mixing up nine different things that can go right or go wrong, people get bogged down and that ends up hurting the multiple.”', 'Bazinet was referring to Netflix’s play in video games, but he’s really referring to the curse of too much success. As he tells it, the costs of winning the streaming wars are going to mean Netflix has to spend too much money on content. Sure, its stock is going to go up, he added, but not by as much as the Street thinks.', 'Netflix did not respond to a request for comment.', 'Netflix’s position as the leader in streaming wasn’t in question to Bazinet, with the analyst calling it “a well-run company that has executed remarkably well in a highly competitive market.” But that’s not good enough for Citibank: “We no longer find the risk-reward compelling.”', '“The evidence is clear to us and many others that Netflix has ‘won’ the streaming wars,” Bazinet writes, but that came with a huge stock appreciation, from roughly $200 per share in mid-2022 to about $485 per share today. And the market is pricing in a lot more room for it to run.', 'Citi Research sees more appreciation ahead, to be sure, but not at the rate of its peers on the Street. And missing Wall Street’s expectations tends to hurt a company’s stock price, even if underlying performance remains strong. For example, in the third quarter of 2023, Alphabet grew revenue by 11% to $76.9 billion for the period, but missed analyst expectations on its closely watched cloud segment, causing the stock to fall 8.8%.', 'Like any analyst, Bazinet has to decide whether to get out of a good stock when it’s at its peak and avoid the downslide, even if the consensus is the opposite. “I could be wrong,” Bazinet says. “But my intuition is, that is the time when you step off the gas and stop accumulating shares.”', ""Bazinet’s view is a minority. Bank of America pointed to Netflix's almost 250 million subscribers and the fact its competitors had gone back to licensing their content to the streamer as promising signs for the company. Netflix also didn’t have to deal with the pesky task of managing a declining linear television business, as many of its legacy competitors did. The press has touted Netflix the undisputed winner, with a flurry of articles announcing its victory in the heated contest for audiences’ screen time."", ""However, as Netflix consolidates its position in streaming, it may look to break into another market of the entertainment industry: video games. If that happens things could get confusing for investors. With a video game studio investors would have to contend with new questions about Netflix’s performance. Suddenly they’d have to try things like how many copies of a new game Netflix sold or whether in-app purchases on mobile games were bringing in enough money, Bazinet says. All things that confuse the narrative for a streaming company. In other words, they would fail Bazinet's grandma test."", 'For Bazinet, it’s the cost of the very things Netflix will need in order to compete in the tough streaming market that other analysts may be undervaluing. To keep fending off its competitors, Netflix will need to spend billions on content, as all media companies do. In 2023, Netflix spent $13 billion, a relatively lower number than expected because it was forced to halt production for several months during the dual writers and actors strike.', 'Over the next two years, Citi expects Netflix to have higher than forecasted spending on content. For this year, Netflix said it expects to spend about $17 billion, which analysts have already factored into their estimates. But Bazineet sees forecasts for next year undervalued by about $2 billion—he thinks spending will be closer to $20 billion. Meanwhile, Disney announced it would reduce its content spend for fiscal 2024 by $2 billion to $25 billion. Bazinet is quick to caution that comparisons between legacy media and streaming companies aren’t apples to apples.', ""Just spending more on content doesn’t necessarily translate to more Netflix subscribers, Bazinet says. “The jury is still out on what is the appropriate quantum of content spend to sustain a direct to consumer global, pay TV substitute app,” he says. “I don't think anyone really knows the answer to that question. We certainly know it's more than in the linear world.”"", 'Netflix has never done a major acquisition, even though it has roughly $7.4 billion in cash as of the third quarter of 2023, but a video game studio with significant intellectual property assets and a well-rounded mobile game studio could be a prime candidate for its first, according to Bazinet.', 'Netflix already dabbles in gaming, with mobile games, some based on its existing intellectual property, such as Stranger Things. Netflix’s current slate of mobile games is growing, with downloads up a reported 180% year-over-year. In August, Netflix conducted the first tests for cloud streamed games in the U.K. and Canada that are available directly on its app and can be streamed on a computer or television.', ""Even though Netflix has made a few small acquisitions, including for smaller gaming companies like Boss Fight Entertainment and Night School Studio, it's never done a big-time M&A deal. It would also mean the company would need to shell out a huge amount of the cash it currently has in its coffers, but that would mean its free cash flow would suffer."", ""While hardly a certainty, it would be an understandable decision given Netflix’s early forays into gaming and interest in acquiring more intellectual property to turn into movies and television. On an earnings call in July, Netflix co-CEO Ted Sarandos indicated Netflix would be open to buying intellectual property, even if the bias to create its own remains. “Going out and finding IP that's unmined is not easy,” Bazinet says."", 'Netflix already has an agreement with gaming studio Ubisoft to turn its popular Assassins Creed franchise into a live action series and develop at least three mobile games.', ""For Bazinet, the most natural partners for a possible video game acquisition are Take Two, which owns popular titles like Grand Theft Auto and the NBA game NBA2K, and EA, best known for its\xa0 soccer video game EA Sports FC. Take Two, in particular, would be appealing in Bazinet’s eyes because its much-anticipated Grand Theft Auto, which he called an “iconic piece of video game IP” would lend itself well to a film adaptation. “Maybe it’s a bad analogy, but it's almost like Barbie,” he says. “You have the potential to take something and broaden its appeal, so it becomes more of a cultural phenomena.”"", 'This story was originally featured on Fortune.com']"

Meantime, Citi on the back of these numbers coming out with a note today pointing out the acceleration in adoption now, Citi is still a neutral on Netflix, we should point out. But they've got a $500 price target, but that update definitely caught their eye as well."", ""I did want to mention, not only do we get that news on Netflix, but we're watching the media sector more broadly here today. And that's because Redburn Atlantic actually downgraded Paramount Global to sell and Warner Brothers Discovery to neutral and said linear advertising is at a negative tipping point, which is not what you want to hear if you rely on linear advertising."", ""JOSH LIPTON: Yeah, that was-- the issue is just that it's kind of a negative tip point. I mean, I guess his point was to his clients was he thinks it hits both names, but Paramount more, which is why he went in that direction with that."", 'JULIE HYMAN: Right. And then, of course, we still have the whatever is happening with Paramount or National Amusements, the parent company of Paramount. ""The New York Post"" reporting today that Shari Redstone is now going to be having a formal auction process not for Paramount, but for National Amusements, the parent company. So that M&A speculation game is ongoing.', 'JOSH LIPTON: Exactly right.', ""JULIE HYMAN: Yeah. All right, let's talk about Aritzia as well. This is a Canadian apparel chain.

It's at a considerably higher price point than those various chains."", ""JOSH LIPTON: Yeah, they might like the styles, but the stock has been rough.

So caveat that we should mention when we are looking at all of these various spot Bitcoin ETFs and obviously there were a suite of them that were trading today.

If you want to skip our discussion on the employment trends in the US, you can go directly to the 5 Companies With The Most Employees In The US.', 'The US labor market has experienced significant changes following the COVID-19 pandemic. In 2022, over 50 million employees chose to leave their jobs, building upon the 47.8 million resignations observed in 2021. The trend began to change in 2023, with a gradual decline, as 30.5 million workers resigned by August 2023. According to labor economists, the majority of individuals who resign from their jobs do so to pursue alternative opportunities rather than exiting the workforce entirely. This point is also reiterated by the fact that the rate of hiring has consistently exceeded the rate of resignations across most industries. For instance, while the leisure and hospitality industry lost 837 thousand employees in September last year, the sector also hired 1.1 million new individuals during the same month. The leisure and hospitality industry has consistently held the top position in hiring rates across all industries since November 2020, ranging from 6% to around 19%. This hiring pace surpasses the national average, which was recorded at 3.7% in September 2023.', 'The most recent jobs report from the Bureau of Labor Statistics indicates a significant increase in the active workforce, signaling a positive trend in employment. However, the current labor force participation falls short of pre-pandemic levels. If we were to match the labor force participation rate with the February 2020 benchmark, an additional 2.2 million individuals would be part of the workforce. This shortage is having a widespread impact across all industries and is noticeable in nearly every state.

The acquisition terms were very favourable for JPM and the facts that few, if any, other banks could have taken over the whole of First Republic Bank in its then-present state while guaranteeing more than $100 billion of its deposits played a role. JPM could do it. It is not only the largest, but also by its balance sheet the strongest US bank and, in our opinion, clearly the best managed. It has come out of this crisis even stronger. We have actively followed the banking sector for 20 years in many countries around the world. Our view is that a well-managed bank can be a very good long-term investment but that it is better to focus on the best and highest quality available.

If you still have some burning questions about this type of valuation, take a look at the Simply Wall St analysis model.', ' Check out our latest analysis for Zoetis ', ""We use what is known as a 2-stage model, which simply means we have two different periods of growth rates for the company's cash flows. Generally the first stage is higher growth, and the second stage is a lower growth phase. To start off with, we need to estimate the next ten years of cash flows. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years."", ""Generally we assume that a dollar today is more valuable than a dollar in the future, and so the sum of these future cash flows is then discounted to today's value:"", '2024', '2025', '2026', '2027', '2028', '2029', '2030', '2031', '2032', '2033', ' Levered FCF ($, Millions) ', 'US$2.30b', 'US$2.43b', 'US$2.68b', 'US$2.92b', 'US$3.24b', 'US$3.48b', 'US$3.68b', 'US$3.86b', 'US$4.01b', 'US$4.15b', 'Growth Rate Estimate Source', 'Analyst x7', 'Analyst x7', 'Analyst x4', 'Analyst x4', 'Analyst x2', 'Est @ 7.35%', 'Est @ 5.81%', 'Est @ 4.73%', 'Est @ 3.98%', 'Est @ 3.45%', ' Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 6.2% ', 'US$2.2k', 'US$2.2k', 'US$2.2k', 'US$2.3k', 'US$2.4k', 'US$2.4k', 'US$2.4k', 'US$2.4k', 'US$2.3k', 'US$2.3k', '(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$23b', ""After calculating the present value of future cash flows in the initial 10-year period, we need to calculate the Terminal Value, which accounts for all future cash flows beyond the first stage. For a number of reasons a very conservative growth rate is used that cannot exceed that of a country's GDP growth. In this case we have used the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield (2.2%) to estimate future growth. In the same way as with the 10-year 'growth' period, we discount future cash flows to today's value, using a cost of equity of 6.2%."", 'Terminal Value (TV)= FCF2033 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$4.1b× (1 + 2.2%) ÷ (6.2%– 2.2%) = US$106b', 'Present Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$106b÷ ( 1 + 6.2%)10= US$58b', 'The total value, or equity value, is then the sum of the present value of the future cash flows, which in this case is US$81b.

Do keep this in mind.', ""Now the most important inputs to a discounted cash flow are the discount rate, and of course, the actual cash flows. If you don't agree with these result, have a go at the calculation yourself and play with the assumptions. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Zoetis as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 6.2%, which is based on a levered beta of 0.800. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business."", 'Strength', 'Earnings growth over the past year exceeded the industry.', 'Debt is well covered by earnings and cashflows.', 'Dividends are covered by earnings and cash flows.', 'Weakness', 'Earnings growth over the past year is below its 5-year average.', 'Dividend is low compared to the top 25% of dividend payers in the Pharmaceuticals market.', 'Expensive based on P/E ratio and estimated fair value.', 'Opportunity', 'Annual earnings are forecast to grow for the next 4 years.', 'Threat', 'Annual earnings are forecast to grow slower than the American market.', ""Whilst important, the DCF calculation is only one of many factors that you need to assess for a company.

Instead the best use for a DCF model is to test certain assumptions and theories to see if they would lead to the company being undervalued or overvalued.

The zoo is world renowned for its specialized veterinary care and decades-long commitment to wildlife conservation work, and one of the biggest challenges their koala population faces is koala retrovirus (KoRV). This virus is associated with numerous fatal conditions - susceptibility to bacterial infections, leukemia, lymphoma, and other cancers - and 100% of koalas in North America carry it. Research shows that 100% of wild koalas in the Australian states of Queensland and New South Wales have it, and between 15% and 70% in Victoria have it, too. How is this possible?', 'Everyone is part virus', ""Viruses that are transmitted horizontally - that is, through infection - are exogenous. These are the kind we're most familiar with. They inject their genetic code into an organism's somatic (nonreproductive) cells, tricking them into making copies of the virus, which can then go on to infect other organisms."", ""However, some viruses hit the proverbial motherlode and inject their genetic code into an organism's germline (reproductive) cells - the sperm or eggs. Once this happens, the viral DNA can become a permanent part of their host's genome: an endogenous virus, transmitted not horizontally but vertically, from one generation to the next."", ""It sounds alarming, but it's commonplace. All living organisms have accumulated retroviral DNA as part of their own. The remains of endogenous retroviruses constitute up to eight percent of the human genome. But in most species, these viral integrations transpired millions of years ago, and the DNA has degraded to the point where it can no longer infect other hosts nor cause health problems. (A virus that killed its host and also couldn't transmit outside the body would quickly be eliminated by natural selection.)"", '""We don\'t know what happens to the host between the time a retrovirus is exogenous and when it becomes a relatively harmless hitchhiker,"" says Alex Greenwood, head of the Department of Wildlife Diseases at the Leibniz Institute for Zoo and Wildlife Research. ""We also do not know how the virus changes, if at all, during this time to better adapt to the host.""', 'Rachael Tarlinton, associate professor of Veterinary Cellular Microbiology at the University of Nottingham, adds that ""in some cases these viruses are also beneficial for their hosts, changing gene expression and introducing new genetic diversity. We just don\'t know how this process happens, or how quickly the changes to host and virus take to settle down.""', 'Koalas at risk', ""KoRV is a different case. It only started endogenizing within the last 50,000 years - on an evolutionary timescale, that's practically yesterday - so some of its subtypes are still exogenous, and none of its sharp edges have yet been sanded down, so to speak."", ""KoRV subtype A is endogenous: That's the kind that 100% of the San Diego Zoo's koalas and most wild koalas have. But subtypes B, C, and so on are still exogenous, and all subtypes are associated with serious health problems. A few years ago, the zoo briefly detected exogenous subtypes in its koalas using PCR tests, and they were able to change their care and breeding practices to keep these subtypes from spreading."", ""It helps that koalas are naturally solitary and sleep up to 20 hours a day - they don't breed freely in large social groups like some animals do. Instead, the zoo's wildlife care specialists manage their genetic diversity using careful records of mean kinship, which keep track of how closely the animals are related. For each female, they maintain a list of the most suitable males, and introduce them to her one at a time until she accepts one to mate with."", 'A female koala becomes sexually mature at two years old and typically lives 12 to 14 years. In that time she can have eight to 10 babies (called ""joeys""), but among wild koalas, chlamydia is a widespread and pernicious cause of infertility. Thankfully, it\'s easily detectable, and the zoo\'s careful breeding management keeps their population free of it.', 'However, all koalas remain at high risk for cancer. Cora Singleton, senior veterinarian for the San Diego Zoo Wildlife Alliance, describes its occurrence as sudden and heartbreaking: ""Koalas are very good at hiding early stages of some cancers. They may appear normal one day, then show a subtle behavior change the next day. We check the blood and bone marrow and find that they have late-stage cancer, which progresses rapidly."" Sadly, there\'s no known treatment for the koalas at that point.', 'KoRV is associated with these health issues and widely hypothesized to be what\'s causing them, but more genomic research is needed to bridge that gap. ""It\'s difficult to prove that causative link,"" says Damien Higgins, professor of wildlife health and pathobiology at the University of Sydney. ""We see a whole range of conditions in koalas that often occur with immune suppression or dysfunction, and we see association of higher levels of koala retrovirus in those animals, but it\'s a bit of a chicken-or-egg situation.""', 'The iConserve koala retrovirus sequencing project', 'In 2021, Greenwood, Tarlinton, Singleton, Higgins, and David Alquezar, manager of the Australian Centre for Wildlife Genomics at the Australian Museum, hosted the Second Koala Retrovirus Workshop to facilitate multidisciplinary discussions about KoRV and koala management.', ""One of that workshop's ultimate recommendations recognized a need for longitudinal studies, across multiple generations, to investigate the genetic causation of these health conditions-and in 2023, Singleton contacted iConserve, a community program at Illumina, to begin just such a study with the cooperation of her workshop colleagues."", 'The San Diego Zoo preserves genetic samples of most koalas in their care, including many from former generations dating all the way back to the current population\'s founders in the 1970s - and Illumina performed whole-genome sequencing on all of them. This data, spanning five generations, was uniquely valuable. ""It\'s a closed system whose pedigree we understand, which would not be possible from a population in the wild,"" Alquezar explains. ""It\'s a longitudinal study that\'s really relevant in this particular case. We\'ve never had this type of information before."" Ultimately, the project will represent the largest pedigree of any koala genomic database to date.', 'The study will compare the known causes of death in the zoo\'s pedigree with any KoRV integration patterns revealed in the sequencing data, to see how strongly particular integration sites associate with negative health outcomes. For example, Singleton explains, ""If we see that specific KoRV integration patterns are associated with certain cancers in koalas from the past, we may be able to predict which koalas in the future will be at higher risk of developing these cancers."" Information like this would be critical to take into account when, for example, the wildlife care specialists plan which pairs would be best for breeding.', ""This knowledge will also inform management decisions for koalas in the wild. The marsupials' natural habitat range has drastically fragmented in recent years, due in part to the terrible bushfires that struck Australia in 2019 and 2020. Disconnected populations lead to lower genetic diversity and lower resistance to disease. Conservation workers can translocate specific animals from one group to another to increase genetic diversity, and can avoid introducing a new subtype of KoRV to a population where it didn't previously exist."", 'Discovering whether retroviral integration sites are associated with immunological genes would be a huge boon to research. ""There are very few examples of such a virus that is currently endogenizing,"" Alquezar says. ""So for us to be able to understand those mechanisms of endogenization, how it might actually cause disease, is very interesting. We\'re able to decipher that using this particular model. This has implications on koala health and may be an important factor in their conservation.""', 'To intervene or not to intervene', 'Considering how ubiquitous retroviral DNA is in animal genomes, the scientific community has raised the question of whether humans should intervene at all in the slow and likely inevitable process of KoRV endogenization. But those involved in this iConserve study recognize our collective responsibility in this case.', '""Yes, it is a natural process,"" Higgins says, ""but it\'s going on in an unnatural environment and context that humans are causing. It\'s up to us to create an environment where that natural process can unfold. From an evolutionary perspective, it\'s hard to adapt to something if you\'ve got all these other pressures. We\'re identifying which populations are most at risk and focusing on removing other risks to allow them to cope.""', 'Singleton agrees. ""Over time, we expect the koala to adapt to this endogenizing virus. Until this happens, koalas are threatened by KoRV as well as by habitat loss and fragmentation. We can\'t eliminate KoRV from koalas, but we can preserve and protect the healthy ecosystems that they need to survive.""', 'As of this writing, the sequencing phase of the project is complete, and Guilherme Neumann, a postdoctoral bioinformatician at the Leibniz Institute, has already identified over 1500 KoRV insertions across the 91 animals sequenced. As expected for a relatively small zoo population, these koalas generally share more KoRV integration sites than their wild counterparts do. ""The interesting part now,"" Greenwood says, ""will be to see if the shared integrations are generally in parts of the genome where they do less harm - and if so, to focus on the ones that are less widely shared, which may contain the more problematic KoRV integrations. Those might end up being targets for potential management.""', 'In the meantime, Singleton is optimistic that this research could be a turning point for koala conservation. ""We\'ve known for many years that we have something really special in the data from the North American koala population, but we haven\'t been able to access the technology to analyze it,"" she says. ""Through our partnership with Illumina, we are achieving research objectives that seemed unreachable back in 2021. Bringing together this international team, learning from our koala population to help koalas in their native range, is a career pinnacle for me as a zoo veterinarian.""', 'The problem with being a picky eater', 'Koalas eat only eucalyptus, a leaf that\'s toxic to other animals. They\'ve evolved special metabolic and gut microbiome adaptations specifically for digesting it, giving them exclusive access to a food that other species have learned to avoid. Ironically, this may be one reason it\'s so difficult to treat some diseases in koalas. ""In order to eat eucalyptus, the koala is very good at degrading plant toxins,"" Singleton says. ""Similarly, koalas are able to degrade many medications to the point that they become ineffective.', 'View additional multimedia and more ESG storytelling from Illumina on 3blmedia.com.', 'Contact Info:Spokesperson: IlluminaWebsite: https://www.3blmedia.com/profiles/illumina Email: info@3blmedia.com', 'SOURCE: Illumina', 'View the original press release on accesswire.com']"

The company, due to the separation of the Consumer Health unit, has now become a two-sector company focused on the Innovative Medicine and MedTech fields.Growth in the Innovative Medicine unit is being driven by existing products like Darzalex, Tremfya, Erleada, Invega Sustenna and Uptravi, and also continued uptake of new launches, including Spravato, Carvykti and Tecvayli. The MedTech unit is showing improving trends, driven by a recovery in surgical procedures and contribution from new products.J&J is making rapid progress with its pipeline and line extensions. However, headwinds like generic competition and pricing pressure persist. Though J&J has taken meaningful steps to resolve its talc and opioid litigation, uncertainty exists regarding the talc litigations.(You can read the full research report on Johnson & Johnson here >>>)Micron Technology's shares were in line with the Zacks Semiconductor Memory industry over the past six months (+31.4% vs. +31.4%). The company's better-than-expected first-quarter performance, along with sequential growth across all key metrics, reflects the benefits of an improving supply-demand environment and signals that the industrywide sluggish period is nearing its end, and the company is moving back to profitability.The expectation of supply normalization by mid-year 2024 is likely to drive pricing, while the boom in artificial intelligence spending is expected to fuel demand for its chips used in the data center end market. A rising mix of high-value solutions and improving customer engagement and cost structure are growth drivers as well.Additionally, 5G adoption in the IoT devices and wireless infrastructure is likely to spur demand for memory and storage. However, the United States and China's tit-for-tat trade war is a major threat to the company.(You can read the full research report on Micron Technology here >>>)Southern Company's shares have outperformed the Zacks Utility - Electric Power industry over the past six months (+3.7% vs. -4.7%). The company is leveraging the demographics of its operating territories, as in healthy population and job growth, the utility has gradually increased its customer base.With good rate-base growth and constructive regulations, the power supplier is expected to generate steady earnings and dividend growth in the coming years. However, its elevated leverage, along with continued timing and cost overrun issues over its Vogtle project, are major overhangs.While the electric utility holding company's debt-to-capitalization of 62.6% restricts financial flexibility, its $25-billion Vogtle nuclear plant has already exceeded budget and is years behind schedule. Therefore, Southern Company warrants a cautious stance for investors.(You can read the full research report on Southern Company here >>>)Other noteworthy reports we are featuring today are TotalEnergies SE and PACCAR Inc.."", ""Why Haven't You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?

Returns for Nike were 18% in 2021, -30% in 2022 and -12% in 2023. If we compare with the S&P 500, its returns were 27% in 2021, -19% in 2022 and 24% in 2023.

Despite the negative news, UBS reiterated at the end of December its buy rating on Nike with a $138 target.', ""Nike's earnings report disappointed investors for a third quarter in a row, with revenue coming in below expectations. Chief Financial Officer Matthew Friend explained on a call with analysts that the adverse headwinds the company is facing include currency risk due to a strong dollar, making exports from the U.S. less competitive, and consumer weakness, particularly in China, where it generates around 15% of its revenue."", ""While the Oregon-based company's earnings of $1.03 per share exceeded analysts' estimates of 85 cents, revenue of $13.39 billion was short of the projected $13.43 billion."", ""Additionally, Nike slashed its outlook for 2024 as China's economy struggles to reaccelerate and as the high federal funds rate is keeping the dollar strong, putting downward pressure on revenue. The revenue growth is expected to decline 1%, which is down from the previous guidance of around 5% growth."", ""Looking at the financials, however, not everything is grim. Taking the last five years into consideration, Nike's revenue has climbed, on average, at a 7.1% growth rate.

(NASDAQ:META) that has proven to be beneficial."", 'Essentially, Nike has announced plans to slash $2 billion of expenses in 2024. The initial reaction of investors was obivously the fear that this initiative will reduce investments in growth, new product lines, improving the supply chain or expanding into promising markets such as India and the Middle East.', 'However, looking into the different lines of the plan, it becomes clear that none of the latter is compromised. The plan will lead to a large restructuring that will initially cost around $400 millon to $450 million to implement and will actually simplify the corporate structure by significantly reducing the number of management layers and divisions, as well as increasing internal efficiency. To any investor, this plan is a welcome turnaround hope of a well-known brand that has the logistics, the network and the media attention to continue growing in existing markets and expand into new ones.', ""Additionally, there are several macro tailwinds awaiting the company. The obvious one is the likely Federal Reserve rate reduction (at least three rate cuts are expected this year per the fed dot plot), which could lead to a U.S. consumer demand uptick as interest rates drop. It would also make debt financing cheaper for Nike, though it has a net debt-to-EBITDA close to zero. On the other side of the Pacific, with China likely having to stimulate its economy aggressively, a quantitative easing program by the People's Bank of China could spark an intense buying spree among Chinese consumers."", 'Nike has had a couple of difficult years, with the most recent quarters being rather challenging, to say the least. And yet, given the solid brand name, the reliable supply chains and the established partnerships, the company has potential to return to a path of high growth. 2024 has several macro tailwinds in store for the athletic footwear and apparel sector, and if Nike successfully implements its ambitious restructuring plan, then it will likely remain one of the sector leaders and catch up on its performance.', 'This article first appeared on GuruFocus.']"

A company like Upstart (NASDAQ: UPST), which has developed a disruptive AI-powered lending service, might be on your radar right now.', ""If you're an investor looking to add shares of Upstart to your portfolio, however, you should think twice. It's better to buy PayPal (NASDAQ: PYPL), a magnificent fintech stock, instead. Here's why."", 'Upstart provides its technology to banks and credit unions, which use the platform to better analyze the creditworthiness of borrowers. The business earns fees anytime its system helps to originate loans. Since its founding in 2012, Upstart has approved $35 billion of loan volume.', 'Over time, growth has been notable. However, in the past couple of years, it has become obvious how sensitive Upstart is to macroeconomic factors, especially higher interest rates. The business was experiencing monster growth and generated sizable net income in 2021, but this was when the U.S. central bank was more accommodating.', 'In 2023, though, things took a huge turn for the worse. Revenue declined 46% year over year in the first nine months last year, and Upstart posted a net loss of $198 million during this time. This helps explain why the stock is currently sitting 91% below its all-time high, even though it soared more than 230% last year.', ""The company's struggles make sense. When interest rates are higher, demand from borrowers will be under pressure. This leads to a very cyclical enterprise that has yet to prove that it can add revenue and report positive earnings over a full economic cycle."", 'In my opinion, Upstart is a very risky stock that should be avoided.', 'Despite persistent macro headwinds, PayPal continues to post healthy gains. Revenue increased by 8% through the first nine months of 2023, and total payment volume was up 15% in the latest quarter compared to the same periods in 2022. Consumer discretionary spending might not be as strong as it was during the depths of the pandemic, but this company is still growing, which is obviously a positive sign.', ""It's very easy to find reasons to like PayPal's business. Its digital wallet is the most widely accepted among the top 1,500 merchants in North America and Europe, ubiquity that makes PayPal a leading brand in the payments industry. Engagement continues to rise as transactions per active account increased by 13% in the last quarter."", ""PayPal's competitive position is protected thanks to the presence of network effects. Having 35 million merchants and 393 million individuals on the platform creates a two-sided system where the growth of one type of user immediately benefits everyone else. It's a virtuous cycle that gets stronger over time."", ""Conversely, I'm not sure if Upstart possesses an economic moat right now. To its credit, it has developed proprietary technology utilizing AI and machine learning. But there's nothing stopping the big banks that dominate lending activity from working on their own innovative lending systems."", 'As of this writing, PayPal shares are a huge bargain. They trade at a forward price-to-earnings ratio of just 11. This is about the cheapest they have sold for in the last three years. The pessimism is sky-high.', ""It's hard to pinpoint exactly why the stock fell 14% in 2023 and is 80% off its peak price. But slowing growth might deserve the blame. These worries are overblown, given that PayPal is still posting solid gains."", 'At the beaten-down valuation, investors are getting a competitively advantaged and profitable enterprise that is in no way running into financial troubles anytime soon. That seems like a good bet.', 'So forget about Upstart. PayPal easily looks like the better stock to buy and hold for the long term.', 'Should you invest $1,000 in PayPal right now?', 'Before you buy stock in PayPal, consider this:', ""The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and PayPal wasn't one of them.

190,134d63f3-0103-364b-8275-1e5bef24a9d8,PYPL,2024-01-12,2 Nasdaq-100 Stocks That Are Screaming Buys in 2024 and 1 to Avoid,Motley Fool,https://finance.yahoo.com/m/134d63f3-0103-364b-8275-1e5bef24a9d8/2-nasdaq-100-stocks-that-are.html,1705054860,STORY,"['COMP', 'PYPL', 'SBUX', 'TSLA']","[""When the curtain closed on 2023, optimists emerged as winners (as is often the case). Although the Dow Jones Industrial Average made headlines for streaking to a record high, it's the 43% gain for the Nasdaq Composite\xa0and the even more robust 54% increase in the Nasdaq-100 that really shined brightest. These gains demonstrate that investors' appetites for growth stocks and innovation is as strong as ever."", ""But just because the Nasdaq-100 was a standout index in 2023 doesn't mean all 101 of its components share the same outlook. (One company has two classes of shares, which is why there are 101 and not 100 components.) As we push ahead into 2024, two Nasdaq-100 stocks have separated themselves as exceptional buys, while another high-flying component with waning first-mover advantages is worth avoiding."", ""Though investors can probably find a handful of Nasdaq-100 stocks with a lower price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio, few offer a more attractive price-to-earnings-growth ratio (PEG ratio) than fintech leader PayPal Holdings (NASDAQ: PYPL). PayPal's stock finds itself roughly 80% below its all-time high."", 'This massive pullback is a function of two things: weaker gross margin, as competition in digital payments picks up, and concerns that a higher inflation rate would crimp the discretionary purchasing power of low-earning workers. PayPal is predominantly a fee-driven platform, so fewer transactions are expected to translate into lower gross profit.', ""While these are tangible worries, they're not overly concerning, given PayPal's continually improving key performance indicators, as well as the growth trajectory for digital payments. With regard to the latter, a 2023 report from Boston Consulting Group estimates that global fintech revenue can grow by more than 500% to $1.5 trillion by 2030."", ""But what's far more exciting than fintech's growth trajectory still being in the early innings is PayPal's steadily improving user-engagement statistics. In less than three years, the average active account on PayPal's digital networks went from completing fewer than 41 transactions on a trailing-12-month (TTM) basis to nearly 57 transactions over the TTM. More transactions should yield successively higher fees for PayPal and steadily grow its gross profit."", ""I'll add to the above that even with its active account growth stymied at the moment, total payment volume (TPV) traversing its networks has been increasing by a sustained double-digit percentage, without currency movements. When the U.S. and global economy are firing on all cylinders, annual TPV growth of 20% may be sustainable."", ""Getting back to the main point, PayPal's valuation makes a lot of sense for both growth and value seekers. Even though Wall Street's consensus is for PayPal to increase its earnings per share (EPS) by better than 18% on an annualized basis over the next five years, its shares can be purchased for just 11 times forward-year earnings. That's a PEG ratio of well below 1, which signifies what an incredible value PayPal is right now."", 'A second Nasdaq-100 stock that makes for a screaming buy in the new year is well-known coffee chain Starbucks (NASDAQ: SBUX).', ""The past couple of years have been challenging for Starbucks for two reasons. First, the COVID-19 pandemic required the company to adjust its operating model during a period of unpredictable store closures. This includes in China, which continued to lock down various cities and provinces until late in 2022. Starbucks ended fiscal 2023 (Starbucks' fiscal year closed on Oct. 1, 2023) with over 6,800 stores in China."", 'The other headwind for Starbucks has been inflation. While some degree of rising prices is expected, the biggest name in coffee dealt with rapidly rising labor costs (including unionization efforts at select stores) and a surge in the price of coffee. Higher operating costs have a way of squeezing margins.', ""But there's good news on this front. If there's one thing Starbucks possesses, it's exceptional pricing power. Saturating key markets in developed countries, coupled with its well-known brand, has enabled the company to increase its prices above and beyond the rate of inflation. In other words, inflation has actually served as a tailwind that's helped sustain a double-digit growth rate."", 'Another reason Starbucks has been practically unstoppable is the relatively steady expansion of its Rewards Membership program. The company closed out fiscal 2023 with 32.6 million active Rewards members, which is up 14% from the prior year. Rewards members spend more per ticket than non-Rewards customers and are also more likely to utilize mobile ordering, which shortens wait times in stores.', ""Perhaps the biggest change since the pandemic began that's really paid off for Starbucks is the revamping of its drive-thru experience. The company updated its ordering boards to include video of its baristas to make the experience more personal. Further, food and beverage pairings are now promoted to encourage the purchase of higher-margin items."", ""Starbucks also sports a historically attractive valuation. Shares can be purchased right now for less than 20 times forward-year earnings. That's lower than any point over the past decade and represents a 35% discount to its average forward-year earnings multiple over the previous five years."", ""While it played a key role in pushing the Nasdaq-100 higher by 54% in 2023, the one component I'd suggest steering clear of in 2024 is none other than North America's leading electric-vehicle (EV) manufacturer Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA)."", 'Shares of Tesla more than doubled last year, with increased EV production and the rollout of the Cybertruck fueling those gains. With regard to the former, Tesla set out to produce 1.8 million EVs in 2023 and achieved this mark with ease (1,845,985 EVs produced).', ""It also officially began deliveries of the Cybertruck on Nov. 30. With CEO Elon Musk previously noting that over 1 million $100 refundable deposits had been placed to secure a reservation for a Cybertruck, there's plenty of optimism that strong follow-through can lead to a big uptick in sales and profits. Tesla is working on its fourth consecutive year of generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) profit."", ""However, Tesla's outperformance last year in no way matches how the company has performed from an operating standpoint."", ""Despite having first-mover advantages in the EV space, Tesla kicked off a price war with other EV manufacturers in 2023. During the company's annual shareholder meeting in May, Musk concisely noted that Tesla's pricing strategy is dictated by demand for its vehicles. More than a half-dozen price cuts across Model's 3, S, X, and Y all but confirm that inventory levels are rising and competition is becoming a thorn in its side."", ""Although price cuts have been able to somewhat slow the pace by which Tesla's global vehicle inventory is increasing, these cost reductions are decimating the company's operating margin. Over the TTM period ended Sept. 30, Tesla's operating margin has been more than halved to 7.6% from 17.2%. This puts the company's operating margin on par with most legacy automakers."", ""Something else for investors to be concerned about is the risk of having Elon Musk as CEO. Despite successfully bringing a handful of EVs to market, Musk has a laundry list of promised innovations that have failed to materialize. If these unfulfilled promises are backed out of Tesla's valuation, it's my contention that shares could fall below $100 in 2024."", ""A forward-year earnings multiple of nearly 65 makes little sense for an auto stock with a plunging operating margin that's also generating a significant percentage of its pre-tax income from unsustainable sources."", 'Should you invest $1,000 in PayPal right now?', 'Before you buy stock in PayPal, consider this:', ""The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and PayPal wasn't one of them.

If you want to skip our discussion on the employment trends in the US, you can go directly to the 5 Companies With The Most Employees In The US.', 'The US labor market has experienced significant changes following the COVID-19 pandemic. In 2022, over 50 million employees chose to leave their jobs, building upon the 47.8 million resignations observed in 2021. The trend began to change in 2023, with a gradual decline, as 30.5 million workers resigned by August 2023. According to labor economists, the majority of individuals who resign from their jobs do so to pursue alternative opportunities rather than exiting the workforce entirely. This point is also reiterated by the fact that the rate of hiring has consistently exceeded the rate of resignations across most industries. For instance, while the leisure and hospitality industry lost 837 thousand employees in September last year, the sector also hired 1.1 million new individuals during the same month. The leisure and hospitality industry has consistently held the top position in hiring rates across all industries since November 2020, ranging from 6% to around 19%. This hiring pace surpasses the national average, which was recorded at 3.7% in September 2023.', 'The most recent jobs report from the Bureau of Labor Statistics indicates a significant increase in the active workforce, signaling a positive trend in employment. However, the current labor force participation falls short of pre-pandemic levels. If we were to match the labor force participation rate with the February 2020 benchmark, an additional 2.2 million individuals would be part of the workforce. This shortage is having a widespread impact across all industries and is noticeable in nearly every state. The education, health services, and professional and business services sectors currently have the highest number of job openings.

Most of the top 20 companies with the most employees in the US are featured on the Fortune 500 list and collectively employ over 10 million people in the US. This means these 20 companies contribute to employing over 6% of the total workforce, which stands at around 168 million as of December 2023. Some of the largest US companies by employee size are JPMorgan Chase & Co. (NYSE:JPM) and International Business Machines Corporation (NYSE:IBM). The companies employ 293,723 and 288,300 individuals, respectively. Overall, the federal government is the largest employer in the US. As of September 2023, approximately 2.95 million individuals were part of the US Federal workforce.', ""Here's what Vltava Fund said about JPMorgan Chase & Co.

One of them, First Republic Bank, with assets of $230 billion, went into receivership and was bought out by the largest US bank, JPMorgan Chase & Co. (NYSE:JPM). The acquisition terms were very favourable for JPM and the facts that few, if any, other banks could have taken over the whole of First Republic Bank in its then-present state while guaranteeing more than $100 billion of its deposits played a role. JPM could do it. It is not only the largest, but also by its balance sheet the strongest US bank and, in our opinion, clearly the best managed. It has come out of this crisis even stronger. We have actively followed the banking sector for 20 years in many countries around the world. Our view is that a well-managed bank can be a very good long-term investment but that it is better to focus on the best and highest quality available. Banking is not a sector where it pays to trade quality for cheaper valuations.

The trend began to change in 2023, with a gradual decline, as 30.5 million workers resigned by August 2023. According to labor economists, the majority of individuals who resign from their jobs do so to pursue alternative opportunities rather than exiting the workforce entirely. This point is also reiterated by the fact that the rate of hiring has consistently exceeded the rate of resignations across most industries. For instance, while the leisure and hospitality industry lost 837 thousand employees in September last year, the sector also hired 1.1 million new individuals during the same month. The leisure and hospitality industry has consistently held the top position in hiring rates across all industries since November 2020, ranging from 6% to around 19%.

The acquisition terms were very favourable for JPM and the facts that few, if any, other banks could have taken over the whole of First Republic Bank in its then-present state while guaranteeing more than $100 billion of its deposits played a role. JPM could do it. It is not only the largest, but also by its balance sheet the strongest US bank and, in our opinion, clearly the best managed. It has come out of this crisis even stronger. We have actively followed the banking sector for 20 years in many countries around the world. Our view is that a well-managed bank can be a very good long-term investment but that it is better to focus on the best and highest quality available.

Number one, we think that a moderation in some of the inflationary pressures that have occurred over the last couple of years will allow consumers to spend more money on discretionary goods, things like apparel, home-related products, sporting goods. And that's important for a lot of retailers because they make better margins on those discretionary goods."", ""Number two, with that being said, it is going to be a volatile year for the retail sector, both because of all the well-documented macro pressures and this is gonna be an election year.

Michael, when it comes to some of the top plays or what investors need to keep in mind in terms of what this all means for positioning, what this all means for companies that maybe are in a better position to benefit from some of these trends that we are seeing, what are some of the top picks within the sector?

But we think it's experiencing momentum that will drive both sales and profitability to improve in 2024."", ""Some of the issues that it's faced are being overindexed to the categories that are weak. And we believe that will become less of an issue this year as those categories like small appliances, consumer electronics, those start to stabilize and improve. Plus, its margins are well below where they've been in prior years, meaning it's gotten opportunity to improve its profitability from here."", ""Another name that we like a lot is Dollar Tree. Dollar Tree runs both the namesake brand as well as the Family Dollar business. Those businesses have been adversely impacted from a very tight labor market as it's been more difficult to attract and retain workers in those stores."", ""We think as the labor market starts to experience some easing, that would actually be a positive for the dollar.

Online sales, health and personal care stores, and clothing and accessory stores led the growth, with online sales skyrocketing by 31.2% year over year.Despite a slight month-over-month dip of 0.4% in clothing and accessory stores, overall December sales remained strong, rising 4.3% year over year.

While the initial use for this hardware was gaming graphics (thus the name), their use quickly evolved to include engineering simulations, cryptocurrency mining, and artificial intelligence (AI) model creation. The latter provided Nvidia a substantial business boost in 2023 (Nvidia grew revenue by 206% in the third quarter of fiscal 2024, ending Oct. 29), which caused the stock to gain nearly 240% in value.', 'Despite this growth, Nvidia is still much smaller than Apple.', ""Even two years ahead, Nvidia's fiscal year 2026 revenue is projected to be about $109 billion. With Apple's current trailing 12-month revenue sitting at $383 billion, it's still far ahead of where Nvidia will be."", ""However, that's not the end of this analysis. If companies were valued by sales alone, commerce businesses like Amazon and Walmart would be valued higher than Apple, as their sales are much higher ($554 billion and $639 billion, respectively). That's why it's important that investors also consider profit margin to make a better assessment."", ""From a profitability perspective, Nvidia has the upper hand on Apple. In their most recent quarters, Nvidia's and Apple's profit margins were 51% and 26%, respectively. This means Nvidia turns more than half of every dollar into pure profit. Furthermore, Nvidia's profit margin dramatically improved throughout the year and will likely continue to rise."", 'This has two effects:', ""Nvidia's profits will grow at a much faster rate than its revenue (at least until its margin stabilizes)."", ""Nvidia's stock will trade at a higher price-to-earnings valuation."", 'Returning to the revenue projections from above, if Nvidia can hit its fiscal year 2026 analyst projection of $109 billion in sales with a 50% profit margin, it will produce $54.5 billion in profits. Likewise, if Apple can hit the analyst target with a 25% margin, it will produce $112 billion in profits.', ""That still doesn't close the gap, but if Nvidia continues growing at a 20% pace until 2030 (the growth rate analysts expect in fiscal 2026) until fiscal 2029 (calendar year 2030), it will have revenue and profits of $188 billion and $94 billion, respectively. Using this same logic for Apple, with a 7% growth rate, it would produce $138 billion in profits."", ""With Nvidia's superior growth rate and profitability, it would be expected to have a premium valuation to Apple. If Apple traded at 21 times earnings (its decade-long historical average) and Nvidia at 35 times earnings (still cheaper than its current 69 times earnings price tag), Apple and Nvidia would be worth $2.9 trillion and $3.3 trillion, respectively."", ""One interesting note here is that despite Apple's growth, if it returns to its decade-long average valuation of 21 times earnings, maintains a 25% profit margin, grows at analyst expected pace for the next two years and 7% beyond that; investors could still lose money from now until 2030 due to the massive premium it trades at currently. Share buybacks could flip this investment from a losing to a winning one, but that effect wouldn't save it from market underperformance if the above assumptions occur. While the math indicates Apple stock could see trouble ahead with slower growth, Apple is owned in a large amount by so many investors that a valuation decline seems unlikely."", ""That's Nvidia's path to being worth more than Apple, but there is one huge caveat that many investors are forgetting: Nvidia is cyclical. While there is a massive demand for its GPUs to build out AI infrastructure, no one knows how large this market is. While it's possible it could be worth the $188 billion in revenue by 2030 I calculated above, I highly doubt it because companies aren't building additional supercomputers."", ""Nvidia's product isn't subscription-based; once a customer buys a product, they don't need another GPU (or thousands of GPUs) until they're ready to upgrade. As a result, Nvidia may be unable to sustain current revenue levels.On the other hand, while Apple's consumer electronic products are also cyclical to some extent, it has a growing subscription-based model that allows it to maintain its revenue throughout economic cycles."", ""So, while Nvidia could be worth more than Apple by 2030 if it follows the growth trajectory outlined above, it's highly unlikely that will happen."", 'Should you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:', ""The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Nvidia wasn't one of them.

But self-driving cars-- or self-driving technology only exists because of AI."", ""DANNY SHAPIRO: That's absolutely right. There's a massive amount of data that's being generated from all the cameras on the car, the radar, now LiDAR on this vehicle. And that has to be processed in real time. So that's where NVIDIA comes in, providing those horsepower to take all that data and make sense of it and understand exactly where the lanes are, where the potential hazards are to be able to read signs, detect the lights."", ""And so we're bringing that out now to make these vehicles safer, to be an assistance feature for them. But they're software updatable vehicles. So over time, we're developing the software with Mercedes and all of our auto customers to be able to then add greater and greater levels of autonomy. And eventually, we'll get to self-driving."", ""DAN HOWLEY: I guess when it comes to self-driving, is there a thought on when that might come? I know it's always the, you know, I guess, billion dollar question that everybody's kind of banding about. And the early prognosticators had said, oh, it'll be here in no time. But, obviously, it's a little bit longer than that probably."", ""DANNY SHAPIRO: Absolutely. You know, so this is a challenge we've been working on for well over a decade. It's something I think the entire industry underestimated the complexity. And the reality is safety has to be the top priority. It is for us. It is for so many of our partners. And we need to make sure we get it right."", ""So while these estimates were put out there initially, we realized we underestimated the complexity. And so we're focused on making sure that before we put anything out on the road, that it's tested and validated for every possible scenario."", ""So this is where another aspect of NVIDIA comes in. We can use simulation technology for the creation of the AI but also for testing and validating that AI and making sure that in all types of lighting conditions, all kinds of weather conditions, many different scenarios, the kinds of things that don't happen very often, it's hard to train for. So we can use AI and create synthetic data to understand what possibly could happen and make sure the car will react appropriately."", 'DAN HOWLEY: Is that something similar to the Omniverse, the digital twin kind of idea that NVIDIA has been working on where, yeah, you can build these digital--', 'DANNY SHAPIRO: Absolutely.', 'DAN HOWLEY: --versions of objects, factories, things like that?', ""DANNY SHAPIRO: You're absolutely right. So we really are able to apply this across the entire workflow within the auto industry from the designers that can use Omniverse and create essentially digital versions of the vehicle, right? That's part of the design process. But then using Omniverse, that exact same model becomes part of what goes into the engineering team, then can go into the manufacturing side where we can create a virtual factory, a digital twin of the factory."", ""It's modeling every aspect of the factory-- the robots, the conveyors, the other employees working inside the factory. We can model all that, optimize it, and make sure it all works before the factory is even built. And then we can even extend that model beyond into the retail side using all that same data to create a virtual retail or showroom experience. People can customize their car; choose different materials, the interior trims, different wheels; and even take it on a virtual test drive."", 'So all of that simulation then is a very valuable tool throughout that whole workflow. So in addition to testing and validating the AVs, it really applies to all the mechanical, physical, and even sort of retail and service extensions of that whole workflow.', 'DAN HOWLEY: So I want to ask you about generative AI. Obviously, it was the huge theme of 2023. Still going to be a big theme into 2024. And I want to get your thoughts on how that kind of fits into the automotive side of things for NVIDIA as well.', ""DANNY SHAPIRO: Yeah, so generative AI, we've just started. And I think the important thing to recognize, it's not just about text in and text out. That's, you know, what ChatGPT kind of started. It has amazing capabilities. There's a lot of room for improvement-- of course, something that's trained on, just a vast array of data. Some of it real. Some of it not-- means the results aren't going to always be accurate."", ""So what we're doing is putting together tools in place to be able to curate data and be able to make sure that if you're going to talk to your Mercedes, you wanted to make sure it has accurate information. So Mercedes can train this large language model with the history of Mercedes vehicles with all the information about the CLA concept, the manual, the service manual, whatever it is so that when you have a dialogue with that vehicle, it comes back with the right answer."", ""But beyond that, we're using generative AI for other data streams that we can put text in and imagery out, text in and video out. Could be video in and text out. So there's so many different ways that generative AI can be used."", ""Imagine, we have an automated vehicle. The front-facing camera is taking in 30 frames a second of video. We can then use a large language model to convert the pixels in that video into an explanation of what's happening in the scene."", ""So basically, the car can explain to you why it's making certain driving decisions or tell you what's going on in the scene to improve your trust and confidence in the system or provide alerts that mean something other than just the beep. So there's so many different ways that generative AI is really helping the auto industry from a designer that may do a sketch. And the generative AI will create a 3D model and in different permutations on that. It becomes a copilot for them, an assistant that is able to make their job and their productivity much better."", ""So it's not going to take their job away. But it's going to make them more productive and create higher quality results. And in the case of all the safety systems, all these tools are going to increase the safety inside the vehicle."", ""DAN HOWLEY: You know, on the automotive side and almost kind of the automotive consumer side, I know NVIDIA also introduced an automotive configurator. It's kind of the idea of being able to build your car on a company's website but in a more advanced way. So can you just kind of explain that to us?"", ""DANNY SHAPIRO: Sure. So we're leveraging the exact same data that's used to build the car and putting those models into more of a marketing role as opposed to engineering role. We can photorealistically render it."", ""People can choose all different aspects of their car, kind of create their dream car. Maybe on their PC, they're doing it. Maybe even on a VR headset experience, look all around, see what that vehicle is going to be like to drive.

Strong retention rates, positive renewal premium changes, higher new business premium in both Domestic Automobile and Domestic Homeowners and other across all the business segments should continue to drive Travelers.The company’s commercial businesses continue to perform well on the back of stability in the markets where it operates, as well as the execution of its strategies. For 2024, the insurer expects renewal premium change to be elevated but moderate into the low-double digits as an automatic increase in limit factors returned to more normal levels, in line with stabilizing industry estimates of replacement costs. In Domestic Automobile, TRV expects renewal premium change in auto to remain very strong but begin to move down from here as more of the book reaches rate adequacy on a written basis.Higher average levels of invested assets, reliable results from the fixed-income portfolio and strong returns from the non-fixed-income portfolio are likely to drive net investment income (NII) higher.

NII should continue to improve as the portfolio gradually turns over and continues to grow.TRV aims to generate increased earnings and capital, maintain a balanced approach to rightsizing capital and growing book value per share over time as part of its long-term financial strategy. Balance sheet strength driven by scale, profitability and cash flow supports it to invest more than $1 billion annually in technology.The property & casualty insurer has an impressive dividend history, increasing its dividend for the last 18 years. Its current dividend yield of 2% is better than the industry average of 0.3%. This makes TRV an attractive pick for yield-seeking investors.Travelers has a VGM Score of A.

On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.', ""While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call, it's worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise."", 'Zacks Consensus Estimate', 'This company is expected to post quarterly earnings of $3.70 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of -19%.', 'Revenues are expected to be $2.27 billion, down 9.4% from the year-ago quarter.', 'Estimate Revisions Trend', 'The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 0.68% higher over the last 30 days to the current level.

However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only."", 'A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.', 'Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss.

Why does this deal or why is this deal a game changer for not only your business at HPE, but the industry at large?"", ""ANTONIO NERI: Yeah, I think it's a defining moment not only for HP, but for the networking industry at large. We are living an amazing times where AI is a massive inflection point. And we truly believe the networking architecture of the future has to evolve to accommodate the high demands of these AI-intensive workloads."", ""So HP has been on the forefront of AI with our supercomputing business. We have been at the forefront of the cloud journey with our hybrid capabilities with HP GreenLake. And now with this acquisition, we have the core tenant of the new architecture to deliver the capabilities to build and deploy these large AI models. So super exciting, but at the same time I'd say, Seana, is a very, very accretive to our shareholders. And that will drive long-term value for them as well."", 'SEANA SMITH: Yeah, Antonio, before we get to the reaction from shareholders and from Wall Street, I want to ask about just this for you personally. Because just leading the transformation of this legacy tech giant, what has that been like and more importantly, why this deal makes sense right now?', ""ANTONIO NERI: Well, it has been almost six years since I've been CEO, but I have been with the company 29 years have been a journey of a life, I would say. An amazing company with an amazing culture and an amazing talent. My job is to create value for shareholders, but at the same time make the company relevant."", 'And as I think about the journey in the last five years, I declared that the enterprise of the future will be edge centric, cloud enabled, and data driven We invested at the edge. We turned that business into a powerhouse. We grew the business in the last year almost more than 30%. Now, represent 18% of the company revenue.', 'We established the hybrid cloud platform with GreenLake. We have now 29,000 customers on the platform. And we have now a massive opportunity with AI because we have the capability to process data at scale.

How quickly do you think you will be able to take away some of that market share from rival Cisco?', ""ANTONIO NERI: Well, let's talk about the market, Seana. I mean, the market is $180 billion market. On a combined basis, the company will be in the networking business $11.5 billion."", ""So it's only 10%. Think about it. Even though it's a large transaction, so there is a lot of room to grow."", ""But you know what, this is the first time in the company history that we will have all the capabilities to participate in the entire total addressable market.

Normally, you participate in a sliver of the market, whether it's at the bottom, or the top, or the middle."", ""Now we have everything we need to compete in the $180 billion. And we own all the IP to really deliver these AI-driven solutions. So this is a major inflection point for the company. But I will say it's good for customers because they're going to get a modern architecture and a different choice and for our shareholders because the position has to deliver long-term profitable growth."", ""SEANA SMITH: And Antonio, let's talk about the positioning here for shareholders because there has been some criticism of the deal. UBS was out with a note this week saying that maybe shareholders would have preferred a larger buyback versus this acquisition. What are critics missing?"", ""ANTONIO NERI: Well, I mean it's all a matter of expectations, Seana. I will say, as I think about the last five years, we have returned almost $10.5 billion of capital to our shareholders. In fact, we delivered to the penny all our commitments, including the spin off that my predecessor did. And if you think about that return in between '18 and '19 was almost $7 billion. Obviously, we went to the COVID and the recovery period."", ""But that didn't do anything. It didn't do anything for in the long term. In fact, our P multiple was reduced dramatically. And we need to continue to invest in the business, so that we can deliver more value. If you think about the commitment from 2024, we are committed to return 65% to 70% of the free cash flow that we generate to shareholders."", ""We actually increased our dividends by almost 8% starting in 2024. And this creates even more free cash flow that down the road we can return to shareholders, but in a more sustainable way. So I can't think just short term, but our fiduciary duty is to understand what is the best use of our capital for our shareholders that create value in the long term."", ""And the use of cash at this point in time on this transaction was the better use than just doing buybacks because we understand in the long term doesn't do anything. So it's a matter of expectation as they understand the deal, they understand the opportunity in the upside. We think this is going to be well understood."", ""SEANA SMITH: Antonio, the antitrust discussion has come up a few times since you announced this deal. I know that you have said you're not worried much about facing any pressure here from regulators. Why aren't you worried about any pushback on antitrust concerns?"", ""ANTONIO NERI: Well, you know, obviously, we're going to work with our regulators as we always do with any transaction small, medium, and large and collaborate with them with all the information they need. But we don't anticipate any issues. The reality is that when you look at the combined company in the networking business, it's still smaller than the largest networking vendor on the market today."", ""When they look at the customer interest, I think they're going to understand this is a better solution for our customers. So in the grand scheme of things, we don't anticipate any issues, but we're going to collaborate with them. And we expect this deal to close between 9 and 12 months."", ""SEANA SMITH: Antonio, before we let you go, I want to ask just about your personal thoughts about some of the risks associated with AI given the fact that this deal you will now be a larger player within the AI space. How are you looking at-- I guess what are some of your biggest fears, when it comes to the future of AI? And what are some of the steps that you're taking in order to mitigate or limit some of those risks."", ""ANTONIO NERI: Yeah. Well, I believe AI is going to be the most disruptive technology in a lifetime, at least in my lifetime, you know. I think it's going to be bigger than web 1.0 or mobile was at the time. It's going to change the way we live and work. There is no question about that."", ""At the same time, I'm very optimistic about what we can do with this technology. But we have to be responsible and sustainable along the way. And so when I talk to our customers, they're all excited about the potential. But they're equally concerned about privacy, the leak of intellectual property, and the use of AI in a responsible way. And also, remember, that AI has a huge impact on the carbon footprint because it requires massive amounts of computational power."", 'SEANA SMITH: Antonio, always great to have you. Once again, congratulations on this deal. And thanks so much for taking the time to speak with us here at Yahoo Finance.', 'ANTONIO NERI: Thank you very much, Seana.']"

The company generated $1.8 billion in free cash flow through the third quarter of last year, down from nearly $4.9 billion through the same period in 2022. "", ""Devon Energy's falling free cash flow directly impacted its variable dividend. Last year, the company set a target to pay up to 50% of its excess free cash flow in variable dividends each quarter (after paying its base dividend). With its oil-fueled cash flows retreating, Devon Energy's variable dividend payments declined compared to the prior year: "", ""The oil dividend stock made $2.87 per share in payments last year ($0.80 in base dividends and $2.07 in variable dividends). That was 44.5% less than its total outlay in 2022. While Devon's base dividend payments were 17.6% higher than the prior year, it paid 53.9% less in variable dividends. "", ""On a more positive note, Devon Energy anticipates that one of the headwinds weighing on its cash flow will fade in 2024. It sees capital spending declining by about 10%, driven by lower service costs and a narrower investment focus on its highest-return regions. That would fuel a 20% improvement in its free cash flow, assuming WTI averages $80 per barrel this year (crude's price point in early November when Devon provided its 2024 outlook). Higher free cash flow would give Devon more money to return to investors, including paying variable dividends and repurchasing its beaten-down shares. "", ""Devon Energy believes the steep slump in its share price is a buying opportunity in 2024. That's driving the oil company's plan to shift its capital return strategy. It's targeting to return up to 70% of its free cash flow to shareholders this year. However, it plans to prioritize repurchasing its shares over paying variable dividends in the near term because it believes they trade at an attractive value. That strategy could pay off if oil prices cooperate this year by helping drive the stock price higher.

Park will report directly to Chris Turner, the company’s CFO, and will direct the technology strategy across all four of Yum’s brands: KFC, Taco Bell, Pizza Hut and Habit Burger.', 'Park served as CDTO at Pizza Hut from 2021 on, and in that role he was responsible for the implementation of several new technologies, including Dragontail, an AI system that manages orders. At the end of Q3, Dragontail was operational in about 1,400 U.S. Pizza Huts and roughly 8,000 units globally, according to Yum’s November earnings call. That number is ahead of the projected deployment announced at start of the year, when Yum said it anticipated rolling the system out to 7,000 stores.', 'On the company’s Q1 2023 earnings call, Turner said that stores using Dragontail “consistently see improvements in product quality and customer satisfaction scores” because the tool’s sequencing algorithm and driver dispatch capabilities improved the freshness of delivered foods.', 'Park also directed the deployment of a management app, called HutBot, which the release describing his appointment called a “coach-in-your-pocket” for restaurant managers.', 'With Yum’s digital sales exceeding $7 billion in Q3, technological deployment is key to Yum’s continued success. Park will likely oversee a continued emphasis on digital sales, which enable the company to capture more first-party data and upsell customers in-app.', 'One potential spot of trouble in Yum’s digital strategy could be the fact that major Pizza Hut franchisees in California’s laid off delivery drivers in favor of third-party services. Third-party delivery services hire workers as independent contractors on a piece-work basis, rather than as employees. This meas gig workers delivering fast food orders in the Golden State are not covered by the wage provisions of AB 1228, which establishes a $20 minimum wage for fast food workers on April 1. The end of first-party delivery for a major brand in a sizable market, while not a major shift on Yum’s overall part, does complicate the company’s efforts to control its digital and technological strategy in-house.', 'This story was originally published on Restaurant Dive.

Even amid intense competition in the coffee shop business, Starbucks has many growth drivers it can pull to help its stock make new highs. Currently, SBUX’s average price target sits 15% shy of its all-time high. Still, if CEO Laxman Narasimhan can work his magic, I believe Starbucks has what it takes to return to glory, making me incredibly bullish on the stock after a forgettable 2023.', 'Indeed, Mr. Narasimhan took the helm at a pretty tough time for the Seattle-based coffee giant. The man has since risen to the occasion with new targets that could help Starbucks become a growth darling on Wall Street again. Though competition in the coffee scene has always been quite fierce, it’s grown even fiercer of late, with the likes of Dutch Bros. (NASDAQ:BROS) and even McDonald’s (NYSE:MCD) aggressively seeking to take a bigger share of the morning crowd.', 'Dutch Bros. and McDonald’s seem to view the drive-thru model as a means to eat into Starbucks’ moat. And with the rise of McDonald’s drive-thru-only concept, CosMc’s, which seems to be targeting consumers looking to get a quick (and cheap) caffeine and sugar fix, McDonald’s has arguably never looked this intimidating for Starbucks as its stock sails through some rough waters. That said, don’t count on red-hot rivals to impair Starbucks’ growth as it looks to fend off rivals with its premium brand.', 'Indeed, McDonald’s coffee doesn’t seem nearly as hot as the potential of McCafe and, now, CosMc’s. Over the near-to-medium term, CosMc’s is rolling out steadily, with just a handful of new stores launching in the Texas market. However, in 10 years from now, it’s unclear just how many CosMc’s locations there will be nationwide (there isn’t a set long-term expansion plan in place quite yet) and whether they’ll take a big bite into the market share of the likes of Starbucks.', 'In my prior piece, I noted that Starbucks shareholders had little to fear as McDonald’s looked to increase its market overlap with Starbucks.', 'Why? It all comes down to Starbucks’ premium brand. Though some Starbucks patrons may move over to CosMc’s for their morning brew due to lower prices, I’d argue most probably won’t. At the end of the day, a Starbucks cup is as much a status symbol as a pair of Louis Vuitton boots, at least in my opinion. And as good as McCafe coffee and baked goods are, McDonald’s just isn’t the upscale brand that’d resonate with Starbucks’ most hardcore fanatics.', 'Remember, there’s power to be had in brands, especially in the restaurant space. And under Mr. Narasimhan, I believe the Starbucks brand can be a source of explosive growth as the firm expands overseas.', 'Recently, Starbucks announced its intention to open 1,000 stores in India by 2028. Undoubtedly, India is a fast-growing economy with a middle class that could boom over the coming years. With an internationally recognized (and praised) brand, I have no doubt that Starbucks’ push into India will be nothing short of a ground-breaking success. Should the world economy heal sooner rather than later, I’d also not be surprised if the company decides to surpass its long-term target.', 'As Starbucks expands into India, it will also be busy growing its presence in the Chinese market, a tea-drinking nation with a newfound taste for coffee. In China, there are different rivals (think Luckin Coffee (OTC:LKNCY), which leap-frogged Starbucks to become China’s largest coffee firm) hungry for that morning crowd. But just like in the U.S., I believe no rival can outdo Starbucks.', 'As Starbucks gets more aggressive internationally, I think it will be tough for investors to ignore the long-term growth opportunity at hand. In the meantime, union headlines are going to hog the headlines. But don’t let it distract you from the impressive growth runway ahead of the firm.', 'In five years from now, count me as unsurprised if Starbucks automates more aspects of its business such that union woes become a thing of the past. And if Starbucks rolls out such automation technologies across stores around the world, the scale of longer-term margin growth could stand to be unprecedented.', 'On TipRanks, SBUX stock comes in as a Moderate Buy. Out of 19 analyst ratings, there are seven Buys and 12 Hold recommendations. The average SBUX stock price target\xa0is $109.78, implying upside potential of 18.1%. Analyst price targets range from a low of $98.00 per share to a high of $125.00 per share.', 'Laxman Narasimhan is a terrific CEO who’s about to make Starbucks stock hot again. From the Indian and Chinese market expansion opportunities to automation tech, the future of Starbucks has arguably never looked this bright.', 'Competitors are hungry for Starbucks’ morning crowd, but I think it will be tough to dethrone the Seattle-based coffee kingpin. As more investors appreciate the long-term narrative, expect SBUX stock to start warming up again, perhaps sooner rather than later.', 'Disclosure']"

The 27-year-old soon began ordering baguettes and croissants for his store from a nearby Au Bon Pain.', ""The move came from Shaich's observation that many people weren't buying cookies before noon. Why not offer a complete menu, right?"", 'Sensing an opportunity in the business of sandwiches, Shaich approached venture capitalist Louis Kane, who was running Au Bon Pain at the time.', 'The two entrepreneurs formed a partnership in 1981. They took Au Bon Pain public a decade later; by 1993, the company boasted sandwich-and-soup-serving restaurants across the country.', 'Au Bon Pain then purchased St. Louis Bread, a regional restaurant chain known for its fresh ingredients.', 'Shaich pressed Au Bon Pain leaders to shift more attention toward St. Louis Bread, and the pressure led to a board fight, which Shaich won. Au Bon Pain was then sold to a private equity firm in 1999.', 'Shaich took over as CEO of St. Louis Bread and changed its name to Panera, which is Latin for ""bread basket"" or ""bread bowl.\'', 'The rest is restaurant history.', 'Shaich led an aggressive rollout of Panera Bread locations in the US, cooking up everything from soup to bread loaves to salads.', 'In 2010, Shaich stepped aside as CEO but retained the role of executive chairman so he could pursue philanthropic interests.', 'But Shaich returned to Panera as chairman and CEO in 2013.', 'From 2013 to the time of its sale to JAB Holdings in 2017 for $7.5 billion, Shaich was at the leading edge of digital ordering and fast-casual restaurant rewards programs. In his second stint as Panera CEO, he also launched a clean ingredients menu list — which has since become standard operating procedure for many fast-casual chains.', ""Not known as one to take it easy (based on my experience reporting on Shaich), the restless entrepreneur launched an investment fund dubbed Act III Holdings soon after Panera's sale, with an initial capital of $300 million. Shaich also found more time to rail against the activist investor industry (Panera fought off activists twice)."", ""In 2018, Shaich announced a significant investment in Cava to finance its acquisition of Zoe's Kitchen."", 'Cava debuted successfully on the public markets in 2023, with Shaich as its chairman. He also became a successful author last year with ""Know What Matters,"" which chronicles his journey through the restaurant industry\'s ups and downs.', ""And today, Act III Holdings has an investment portfolio that also includes restaurants Tatte Bakery & Cafe, Life Alive, and BJ's Restaurants."", ""Shaich's advice to future leaders?

If you want to skip our discussion of eating disorders, their causes, and their effects on American society, you can go directly to the 5 States With Highest Rates of Eating Disorders.\xa0', ""Eating disorders are a group of illnesses that affect a person's relationship with food and body image. They are primarily mental illnesses that have been recognized by the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM) since the 1980s. The current edition of DSM recognizes eight categories of eating disorders. If you were wondering which mental illness has the highest mortality rate, it is Anorexia Nervosa. The disease causes a strong fear of gaining weight, and its patients resort to extreme exercise and calorie limitations. On the other hand, binge eating, which leads to several other diseases such as obesity and heart attack, also causes significant mortality indirectly.\xa0"", 'A significant portion of America has an eating disorder. According to the National Association of Anorexia Nervosa and Associated Disorders, almost 30 million Americans live with an eating disorder. If you live in America, there is a 9% chance that you will develop an eating disorder in your lifetime. However, this illness disproportionately affects women as they are twice as likely to develop an eating disorder compared to men. In fact, eating disorders are the third most common chronic illness in adolescent females.', 'Insurance data depicts an alarming situation regarding eating disorders. There has been a significant increase as the share of claim lines related to eating disorders among all claims increased by 65% between the years 2018 and 2022. However, it is worth noting that the majority of eating disorder claim lines as a percentage of total claim lines increased in the first year of the pandemic (2019 - 2020), during which it rose by 39%.\xa0', ""The worsening of America's eating disorder crisis during post-pandemic has triggered several state laws aimed at tackling the surge. Lawmakers across the country are proposing restrictions on social media algorithms to prevent them from promoting harmful content. These laws are specifically proposed to counteract anorexia, which according to the National Association of Anorexia Nervosa and Associated Disorders, claims 10,000 lives every year. The proposed restrictions also include preventing the sale of weight loss pills to minors. Other proposals include adding eating disorder prevention into the school curriculum.\xa0"", 'While anorexia is one of the most common eating disorders and claims the most lives, disorders such as binge eating and emotional eating are also a serious concern. The mortality rate of these disorders gets underreported as most of the time they contribute indirectly to death. Binge eating for several years, for example, can lead to cardiovascular disease, which is also a result of several other factors, such as lack of mobility and exercise.\xa0', ""The popularity and prevalence of fast food may be contributing to the eating disorder crisis in the country. Research has shown a positive correlation between fast-food consumption and eating disorder risk in teenagers. America has a thriving fast-food culture and is home to some of the most popular fast-food chains in the world. McDonald's Corporation (NYSE:MCD) is one of the largest fast-food chains. The restaurant chain has the highest number of franchises in the world. Up until recently, McDonald's Corporation (NYSE:MCD) was also the leading fast-food chain in terms of revenue, a title which now belongs to Starbucks Corporation (NASDAQ:SBUX), another American fast-food company. Starbucks Corporation (NASDAQ:SBUX), the largest fast food company in terms of revenue, earned $32.9 billion during 2022. For comparison, McDonald's Corporation (NYSE:MCD)'s revenue for the same year was $23.18 billion. With America's thriving fast-food culture, both companies have a positive outlook. Here is what RiverPark Advisors, an investment advisory firm and sponsor of the RiverPark family of mutual funds, said about Starbucks Corporation (NASDAQ:SBUX) in its Q3 2023 investor letter:"", '""Starbucks Corporation (NASDAQ:SBUX): SBUX is the premier roaster, marketer and retailer of specialty coffee in the world, operating in 83 markets. Through its more than 36,000 global stores (roughly 50% operated and 50% licensed) the company offers handcrafted coffee, tea and other beverages and a variety of food items. SBUX also sells a variety of packaged coffee and tea products and licenses its trademarks through other channels such as grocery and foodservice through a Global Coffee Alliance with Nestlé. In addition to its flagship Starbucks Coffee brand, the company sells goods and services under the brands Teavana, Seattle’s Best Coffee, Ethos, Starbucks Reserve and Princi.', 'SBUX’s recently appointed CEO (March 2023), Narasimhan Laxman, reiterated the company’s long-term plans for 10-12% revenue growth and 15-20% EPS growth while reporting fiscal 3Q23 earnings. Revenue will be driven by a combination of factors including unit growth, higher food “attach” rates (more food sold per cup of coffee), equipment innovation to speed throughput, and delivery expansion. In addition to the leverage of higher revenue across the company’s fixed asset base, SBUX sees margin expansion from supply chain management opportunities and procurement efficiencies. We initiated a small position in August.""', ""The rise of eating disorders in the country has paved the way for many treatment centers. In addition, psychiatrists also prescribe certain pharmaceuticals to help deal with life-threatening eating disorders. Most psychiatrists, for example, prescribe Eli Lilly and Company (NYSE:LLY)'s Prozac, a brand name for Fluoxetine. The drug is a commonly prescribed antidepressant, which is also beneficial for people with anorexia. Prozac was introduced by Eli Lilly and Company (NYSE:LLY) in 1986 as a treatment for several psychiatric disorders, including obsessive-compulsive disorder. However, eventually, Eli Lilly and Company (NYSE:LLY)'s Prozac was found to be beneficial for several eating disorders such as anorexia and bulimia nervosa.\xa0"", ""With that backdrop, let's look at 15 states with the highest rates of eating disorders."", 'michaelheim/Shutterstock.com', 'To curate our list of 15 states with the highest rates of eating disorders, we relied on data from Google Trends. Accurate state-wise data regarding people suffering from eating disorders was not available, so we had to rely on the general search interest in each state. Our rationale for this was that the higher the rates of eating disorders, the more popular its related search terms would be. We looked at Google Trends for search popularity of the five most common eating disorders in each state in 2023. Google Trends has an arbitrary rating out of 100 - the higher the rating, the more popular the search term. For each state, we totaled the rating for the five eating disorders and divided it by 5 to arrive at our own eating disorder score. The higher the score, the higher the rates of eating disorders in the state. The eating disorders we considered for our research were: anorexia, bigorexia, binge eating, body dysmorphia, and emotional eating.\xa0', 'By the way, Insider Monkey is an investing website that uses a consensus approach to identify the best stock picks of more than 900 hedge funds investing in US stocks.

The celebrated investor has made billions by sticking to some pretty straightforward strategies."", 'One of the industries that Buffett tends to prefer is financial services. Three of his longest-tenured holdings are payment processors American Express, Visa, and Mastercard.', ""While it's easy to understand why these blue chip brands have earned coveted positions in Buffett's exclusive portfolio, keep in mind that the payments sector has global appeal. For this reason, despite the broad reach of the companies above, there is always a possibility for disruption."", ""One of Buffett's lesser-known financial services positions is Nu Holdings (NYSE: NU), a digital banking platform focused on Latin America. During the past year, shares in the budding fintech nearly doubled. Nevertheless, the company's progress and addressable market suggest that the shares could continue soaring."", ""Let's dig into why Nu could be such a compelling investment for long-term investors."", 'While online banking is becoming more popular around the world, the concept is not yet mainstream for many developing nations.', 'Nu primarily operates in three markets: Brazil, Colombia, and Mexico.

Clearly there is still lots of untapped potential in the company's core market -- and it's seeking to parlay this template to other areas in Latin America."", ""The chart above benchmarks Nu stock against a host of Latin American digital commerce platforms on a forward price-to-sales (P/S) basis. Interestingly, Nu's forward P/S of 3.9 is right in the middle of this peer group."", ""To be sure, the company's forward price-to-earnings ratio of 27 is higher than that of the S&P 500's 21.7. Given its rock-solid performance in 2023 and the long-term potential fueled by higher digital payments adoption rates across Latin America, I think it's appropriate for Nu stock to earn a premium over that of the broader market."", 'Nu appears well positioned to continue penetrating its target markets. Yet despite its rapid revenue and profit growth, I see Nu as still relatively unknown.', 'Given Buffett has owned the stock for a few years now, Nu might just represent the next Visa or American Express for the Berkshire Hathaway portfolio.

DHI reached a new 52-week high of $156.77 on Jan 10. The stock pulled back to end the trading session at $154.52, up 1.82% from the previous day’s closing price of $151.76.In the current housing market scenario, improving mortgage rates, pent-up demand and low existing house inventory are benefiting homebuilding and related companies like D.R. Horton. The benefit is reflected in increasing housing starts and sales volumes. As of Jan 4, 2024, according to Freddie Mac, the average 30-year, fixed-rate mortgage is 6.62%, up from 6.61% on Dec 28, 2023, but down from 6.67% on Dec 21, 2023. Although the rates remain elevated (6.48% on Jan 5, 2023) on a year-over-year basis, the Fed’s recent decision to keep the interest rate benchmark between 5.25% and 5.5% along with indication about possible rate cuts in 2024 are expected to push the mortgage rates down further.Apart from macro tailwinds, the company is also benefiting from accretive acquisitions, land investments and home affordability initiatives.', 'This Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company’s shares have gained 51% in the past three months, outperforming the Zacks Building Products - Home Builders industry’s 41.1% growth, the Zacks Construction sector’s 22.2% increase and the S&P 500 Index’s 9.5% rise.', 'Image Source: Zacks Investment Research', 'The company’s earnings estimate for fiscal 2024 has moved north to $14.15 per share from $14.14 per share in the past seven days. The stock portrays a positive trend, indicating robust fundamentals and elevating the expectation of outperformance in the near term, despite an uncertain housing market scenario.', 'Favorable Macro Scenario: D.R. Horton seems to be benefiting from the current housing market scenario, wherein the existing homes inventory is low and mortgage rates are sequentially improving but remain elevated year over year. The Fed’s announcement of stabilizing the interest rate range between 5.25% and 5.5% induced optimism throughout the housing market, thus aiding homebuilding and related companies. Morever, the decision of the Fed to cut rates in 2024 is the cherry on the cake, given the improving scenario, as it will help reduce mortgage rates and increase affordability.\xa0Strategic Investments: D.R. Horton indulges in strategic investments that aid its growth prospects. The investments are evident in its accretive acquisitions and land purchases. As acquisitions are an important part of the company’s growth strategy, it is fast acquiring homebuilding companies in desirable markets.The acquisition of the homebuilding operations of Truland Homes, in July 2023, added\xa0 about 155 homes in inventory, 620 lots and a sales order backlog of 55 homes along with approximately 660 additional lots through land purchase contracts. Furthermore, in fiscal 2023, the company’s homebuilding investments in lots, land and development for the quarter add up to $8 billion, up 6% year over year. DHI’s well-stocked supply of land, plots and homes provide it with a strong competitive position to meet the demand in future quarters, thereby growing sales and home closings.Home Affordability: D.R. Horton is witnessing growth during the uncertain economic scenario from its strategic shift toward more entry-level affordable homes. The current scenario showcases high demand and low sales of existing homes, which are benefiting this homebuilding company. First-time homebuyers represented 55% of its closings in fourth-quarter fiscal 2023.To counter the adverse impacts of the current market uncertainties to some extent, the company has increased its use of incentives and is focusing on reducing the size of its homes, under possible scenarios, to improve house affordability.

While many investors chase high-growth stocks in emerging and unproven industries, it is often the well-established companies in mature markets that deliver the best long-term gains. They do so without putting shareholders through excessive volatility, too.', 'That\'s been the case in my own portfolio, which is tilted toward companies with excellent brand strength and a long track record for steady growth. Here\'s why I\'ve had a few of these ""average"" stocks in my portfolio for more than a decade.', ""I was early on in my investing career when I bought Sherwin-Williams (NYSE: SHW). I liked the paint giant for superficial factors like its large sales base and its growing dividend payment. I had no idea that Sherwin-Williams would succeed in boosting that revenue base through a mix of organic growth and big acquisitions, or that profitability would rise significantly. These factors helped the stock rise over 400% in the past decade, including dividend payments, to double the wider market's rally."", 'Ultimately, I attribute my above-average returns here with patience, luck, and the power of reinvesting dividend payments. My initial investment in the stock in mid-2008 is up 1,600%, but the total returns are closer to 2,000% after including those dividends.', ""McDonald's (NYSE: MCD) operates in an industry that's known for low barriers to entry, tiny profit margins, and a high rate of turnover and bankruptcy. Yet this fast-food giant has been a positive force in my portfolio, delivering about 100 percentage points of excess returns over the S&P 500 in the past decade."", ""Many of the company's competitive strengths are well known on Wall Street. It generates most of its earnings through franchise fees, which translates into higher profitability than is customary in the industry. The chain pays a steadily rising dividend as well."", ""But its the company's openness to reinventing itself that really matters. The chain's core menu hasn't really changed in decades, but the business is always responding to shifting tastes and consumer preferences, most recently by building up a huge mobile ordering and delivery network."", 'These changes apply to the operations, too. A refranchising program this past decade helped boost profit margin to over 40% of sales. The stock could continue generating solid returns given that management is targeting a near 50% margin in the coming years.', 'Not every long-term holding will be a winner, and Nike (NYSE: NKE) fits squarely in that ""underperformer"" category for me. Shares haven\'t kept pace with the wider market in the past decade and are underperforming since I first bought the stock in 2011.', ""Growth has been lackluster in recent years as the footwear and apparel giant struggled with the impact of big swings in demand and raw material prices.

If you want to skip our discussion on the employment trends in the US, you can go directly to the 5 Companies With The Most Employees In The US.', 'The US labor market has experienced significant changes following the COVID-19 pandemic. In 2022, over 50 million employees chose to leave their jobs, building upon the 47.8 million resignations observed in 2021. The trend began to change in 2023, with a gradual decline, as 30.5 million workers resigned by August 2023. According to labor economists, the majority of individuals who resign from their jobs do so to pursue alternative opportunities rather than exiting the workforce entirely. This point is also reiterated by the fact that the rate of hiring has consistently exceeded the rate of resignations across most industries. For instance, while the leisure and hospitality industry lost 837 thousand employees in September last year, the sector also hired 1.1 million new individuals during the same month. The leisure and hospitality industry has consistently held the top position in hiring rates across all industries since November 2020, ranging from 6% to around 19%. This hiring pace surpasses the national average, which was recorded at 3.7% in September 2023.', 'The most recent jobs report from the Bureau of Labor Statistics indicates a significant increase in the active workforce, signaling a positive trend in employment. However, the current labor force participation falls short of pre-pandemic levels. If we were to match the labor force participation rate with the February 2020 benchmark, an additional 2.2 million individuals would be part of the workforce. This shortage is having a widespread impact across all industries and is noticeable in nearly every state.

One of them, First Republic Bank, with assets of $230 billion, went into receivership and was bought out by the largest US bank, JPMorgan Chase & Co. (NYSE:JPM). The acquisition terms were very favourable for JPM and the facts that few, if any, other banks could have taken over the whole of First Republic Bank in its then-present state while guaranteeing more than $100 billion of its deposits played a role. JPM could do it. It is not only the largest, but also by its balance sheet the strongest US bank and, in our opinion, clearly the best managed. It has come out of this crisis even stronger. We have actively followed the banking sector for 20 years in many countries around the world. Our view is that a well-managed bank can be a very good long-term investment but that it is better to focus on the best and highest quality available. Banking is not a sector where it pays to trade quality for cheaper valuations.

With 50 buttons up for grabs, consumers in New York, Los Angeles and Chicago can enter to win via an online sweepstakes now through Jan. 31.', 'Additionally, one-thousand entrants nationwide will receive an offer for a free 8-pack of Bubly. The marketer’s latest move sees it join others who have sought to tap into Dry January hype and arrives as participation in the month-long, alcohol-free challenge grows.', 'While Dry January is officially underway, Americans making the commitment only last 10 days on average, while nearly one in ten give up by Jan. 3, according to press details.\xa0Still, the event presents an opportunity for marketers:\xa0Last year, 15% of U.S. adults, which amounts to over 260 million Americans, pledged to participate in Dry January. To help consumers stick with the alcohol-free challenge, PepsiCo’s Bubly is offering the chance to win a year-long supply of sparkling water.', 'The “press for bubly” button, intended as a nod to a viral “press for champagne” social trend, leverages GPS and LTE technology to deliver free Bubly directly to consumers who press it. To function, each winner’s delivery and contact information will be pre-programmed into the product before it is delivered, and when the button is pushed, a signal will be sent to partner Fooji, which will fulfill the order.

Called “Get Wild,” the effort recognizes that what qualifies as “wild” for the cohort today is very different than in the 2000s and 2010s, when millennials were often scolded for “killing” a variety of industries — including soda.', '“Their lives look different now than they did 10-20 years ago, but they still know how to have fun, they still know how to indulge,” said Jenny Danzi, senior director of Pepsi Trademark, herself a millennial. “It’s just that that indulgence looks a little bit tamer these days.”', 'The campaign comes on the tail of a wide-ranging Pepsi rebrand last year in celebration of the soft drink’s 125th anniversary, which brought a fresh visual identity to Wild Cherry, such as packaging blanketed with colorful cherries carrying Pepsi-blue stems. The refresh and a new Pepsi pulse motif at the start of commercials are present in “Get Wild,” which also carries over mainstay tactics for the brand, such as nostalgic references to popular music.', 'One spot, “Nursery Rhymez,” depicts a pair of new parents spontaneously breaking out into Lil Jon and The East Side Boyz’ party-themed 2002 single “Get Low” while trying to stay quiet enough so as not to wake their baby. Another, “#1 Fan,” follows the intense pre-game ritual of a sports fan set to the driving rhythm of Survivor’s “Eye of the Tiger” only to reveal his over-the-top antics are for a youth flag football game his child is competing in.', 'The ads, which were helmed by director Kate Hollowell and her women-led production house Epoch Films, are live on YouTube now and will debut on national TV as part of NFL Wild Card Weekend starting Jan. 13. Pepsi Wild Cherry is also catering to millennials’ digital habits with media buys on social, podcasts and mobile gaming. Partners include Barstool Sports, Betches, the popular “Call Her Daddy” podcast and Candy Crush Saga.', 'Pepsi Wild Cherry is trying to court favor with a consumer set that has risen to become key sales drivers for flavored cola. Millennial women express a particularly strong preference for the category, the brand said.', '“Within these millennial households that are driving this potential growth, they do skew female,” said Danzi. “It’s both women shopping for themselves, and women tend to be the purchaser for the household.”', '“Get Wild” puts a spotlight on women-owned and -targeted media, including through the Betches partnership, “Call Her Daddy” advertising play and behind-the-scenes work from Epoch Films. VaynerMedia helped develop the campaign.', 'At the same time, “Get Wild” is meant to carry broad appeal, rolling out in earnest around NFL Wild Card Weekend (Pepsi is a sponsor of the football league). Danzi declined to share if there are any Super Bowl plans around the initiative but noted that Pepsi Wild Cherry will remain active in marketing throughout Q1.', '“The beauty of finding a real human insight, even if it’s built from one small segment, is that it tends to resonate across demographics and transcend audiences,” said Danzi. “[The ads] might’ve been built with one specific demographic at its heart, but Pepsi is always for everyone and we’re finding that this campaign is, too.”', 'Pepsi is also making its zero-sugar products a North Star as more consumers gravitate toward better-for-you beverage options. The company reformulated its zero-sugar drinks, including Wild Cherry, last year and promoted the changes in a Super Bowl ad.', 'Starting with the Wild Card Weekend, consumers can text “WILDCHERRY” to 81234 to get a free Pepsi Wild Cherry. The brand since late December has also been running a retail component where shoppers who scan Wild Cherry displays at select retailers can enter for a chance to win an expenses-paid trip to the 2025 Wild Card Weekend. The promotion to date has drawn “tens of thousands of participants,” according to Danzi, though the executive did not share specific figures.', 'This story was originally published on Marketing Dive.

QSR reached a new 52-week high of $79.45 on Jan 10. The stock pulled back to end the trading session at $78.63, up 0.9% from the previous day’s closing price of $77.91.The current Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) company’s shares gained 25.1% in the past three months, outperforming the Zacks Retail - Restaurants industry’s 14.3% growth, the Zacks Retail-Wholesale sector’s 14.8% increase and the S&P 500 Index’s 9.5% rise.The company is benefiting from its expansion initiatives, menu innovation and focus on digitalization. These tailwinds are aiding the company in increasing its guest traffic, thus leading to a rise in its comparable sales, primarily in Tim Hortons, Burger King and Popeyes, the company’s top three brands.', 'Image Source: Zacks Investment Research', 'The company’s earnings estimate for 2024 has moved north to $3.37 per share from $3.36 per share in the past seven days. The stock portrays a positive trend, indicating robust fundamentals and continuation of outperformance in the near term, despite an uncertain economic scenario.', ""Expansion Initiatives: Restaurant Brands is intent on expanding its footprint in new and existing markets. Also, the company continues to evaluate opportunities to speed up the international development of all three brands (Tim Hortons, Burger King and Popeyes) by establishing master franchisees with exclusive development rights and joint ventures with new and existing franchisees.During the third quarter of 2023, QSR opened 250 net new restaurants, contributing to 4.2% year-over-year growth in the overall restaurant count. Furthermore, in the quarter, the company introduced a development incentive program for U.S. franchisees, providing growth opportunities in key markets. Internationally, the company has signed agreements to open more than 100 restaurants in the UAE and Oman over the next 10 years. The company is very optimistic about growth opportunities in 2024 and remains on track to grow its restaurant base toward its long-term goal of 40,000 locations.Diversified Menu Offerings: Restaurant Brands believes that new product development is a key driver of long-term success for its brands and will continue to be in focus. This is expected to drive traffic by expanding the customer base, spreading out into new dayparts, and continuing to build brand leadership in food quality and taste.During third-quarter 2023, Popeyes US witnessed 5.6% growth in same-store sales and a 5.0% increase in net restaurants. This led to a notable 11% growth in system-wide sales. The upside can be attributed to the strength of the sandwich platform and the introduction of Ghost Pepper Wings, resulting in a record digital sales mix of around 25% and the highest chicken QSR traffic share in over two years.Focus on Digitalization: QSR has been focusing on enhancing its digital experiences by incorporating delivery and payment options within its digital platforms. The company's consistent investments in expanding delivery through digital platforms and rolling out the scan and pay feature bode well. This integration paves the path for better guest convenience and improved speed of service (in the drive-thru).During third-quarter 2023, digital sales increased more than 40% year over year, courtesy of strong contributions from kiosks and delivery. The company showcased strong digitalization efforts and continued to drive growth for its Tim Hortons brand, with 5 million average monthly users and a consistent digital sales mix of approximately 30% in the quarter. The company remains optimistic about the growth of digital sales in international markets, backed by various service modes."", 'Here are some other top-ranked stocks from the same sector.Shake Shack Inc.
