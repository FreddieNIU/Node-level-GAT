Should You?,InvestorPlace,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/7-stocks-hedge-funds-flooding-222221203.html,1677190941,STORY,"['PLD', 'MSFT', 'TSLA', 'AAPL', 'BRK-B', 'AMZN', 'SCHW']","[With so many vagaries clouding the present market environment, one possible avenue for success is to align your portfolio with your favorite hedge fund stocks. Simultaneously celebrated and vilified, this special brand of institutional investor might give you an edge. Primarily, your favorite hedge fund stocks typically stem from the top experts in the stock-picking game. And these institutions only hire the absolute best analysts and provide them with unparalleled technical resources. Sure, there’s a tendency to dismiss such experts as clowns. However, the reality is that more often than not, they know what they’re doing.Second, investors may find comfort in the safety of numbers. It’s one thing when one institutional investor places a heavy wager. It’s quite another when several of them make the same bet. Therefore, aligning with your favorite hedge fund stocks might improve your odds. Below are some of the most targeted plays – and whether you should get involved or not.MSFTMicrosoft$254.77AAPLApple$149.40AMZNAmazon$95.82BRK-ABerkshire Hathaway$459,375.00TSLATesla$202.07SCHWCharles Schwab$78.97PLDPrologis$124.01InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsMicrosoft (MSFT)The Microsoft logo outside a building representing MSFT stock.Source: Asif Islam / Shutterstock.comAccording to information provided by HedgeFollow.com, Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) ranked second place among favorite hedge fund stocks. Per the website, this category of institutional investor acquired a total of $58.99 billion worth of MSFT since the beginning of the first quarter of 2023. The top three investors are Norges Bank (buying $20.40 billion), Morgan Stanley ($3.46 billion), and BlackRock ($3.12 billion).Financially, Microsoft arguably represents a no-brainer among popular hedge fund stocks. Per Gurufocus.com’s proprietary calculations for fair market value, MSFT rates as modestly undervalued. On the balance sheet, the company features solid strengths, including an Altman Z-Score of 8.31 (reflecting a very low bankruptcy risk). As well, it features strong growth and outstanding profitability metrics.Story continuesPresently, Wall Street analysts peg MSFT as a consensus strong buy. Further, their average price target stands at $291.70, implying 16% upside potential. In the trailing year, MSFT slipped over 10% as the technology sector suffered badly in 2022. However, since the January opener, MSFT gained 5%.Apple (AAPL)Apple store. Apple Inc. (AAPL) sells consumer electronics, computer software, services and personal computers.Source: Vytautas Kielaitis / Shutterstock.comA stalwart in the consumer tech space, Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) ranks third among favorite hedge fund stocks per HedgeFollow.com. According to the website, these institutional investors acquired a total of $55.48 billion worth of AAPL stock. The top investor so far in Q1 2023 is Norges Bank at $22.44 billion. Coming in second and third were Morgan Stanley ($3.84 billion) and Barclays ($1.57 billion).On paper, Apple should be reeling from the pressures impacting the consumer economy. However, its brand remains as powerful as ever. Currently, Gurufocus.com labels AAPL as modestly undervalued based on its proprietary FMV calculations. Not surprisingly, though, the greatest strengths center on its operational dominance.For instance, Apple’s three-year revenue growth rate stands at 20%, outpacing 85.62% of its competitors. Its net margin pings at 24.56%, beating out 95.52% of rivals. Right now, Wall Street analysts peg AAPL as a consensus strong buy. Further, their average price target stands at $171.94, implying over 15% upside potential.Amazon (AMZN)Closeup of the Amazon logo at Amazon campus in Palo Alto, California. The Palo Alto location hosts A9 Search, Amazon Web Services, and Amazon Game Studios teams. AMZN stockSource: Tada Images / Shutterstock.comEarning its reputation in the e-commerce space, Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) ranks among the favorite hedge fund stocks for its massive footprint. Per HedgeFollow.com, the company comes in fourth place among buy-ins from these institutional investors, which bought $41.62 billion worth. Again, the top investor was Norges Bank, in this case with an exposure of $9.69 billion. Morgan Stanley and JPMorgan Chase rounded out the top three at $2.04 billion and $1.38 billion, respectively.To be fair, Amazon represents a tricky narrative because of the beating it took in 2022. In the trailing year, shares gave up nearly 34% of equity value. As well, Gurufocus.com warns that AMZN may be a possible value trap. Finally, in the past year, the net margin slipped slightly into negative territory.On the other hand, Amazon still represents a growth machine. Its three-year revenue growth rate stands at 21.9%, beating out 84.28% of its rivals. Combined with its brand power and myriad relevancies, it should be worth a look. Presently, covering analysts peg AMZN as a consensus strong buy. Their average price target stands at $137.05, implying 43% upside potential.Berkshire Hathaway (BRK-A)The logo for Berkshire Hathaway displayed on a smartphone screen.Source: IgorGolovniov / Shutterstock.comWhen it comes to discussing Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRK-A), presumably most publications focus on its Class B shares. Regarding popular hedge fund stocks, however, we’re going to be talking about Class A shares – the one where a single share costs more than the average U.S. home.Ranking fifth, hedge funds acquired $29.96 billion worth of BRK-A. The top investor was Perigon Wealth Management at $15.51 billion. Next came CI Private Wealth at $6.81 billion and Norges Bank at $2.58 billion. Financially, Gurufocus.com warns its readers that BRK.A may be modestly overvalued. That said, the industrial conglomerate attracts attention because of its wide-reaching wagers.Plus, it features solid operations. Most notably, its three-year revenue growth rate stands at 19.7%, outpacing 81.3% of its peers. Also, its book growth rate during the same period is 17.3%, beating out 84.3% of the industry. Turning to Wall Street, covering analysts peg BRK-A as a consensus moderate buy. Further, their average price target stands at $542,568, implying nearly 18% upside potential.Tesla (TSLA)Tesla (TSLA stock) Motors store in Piazza Gae Aulenti square in Milan, ItalySource: Zigres / Shutterstock.comAs things stand now, Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) ranks as the top idea among popular hedge fund stocks. These institutional investors bought $60.36 billion worth of TSLA. Further, the top hedge fund was Natixis, buying up $32.35% billion worth of shares. Rounding out the top three were Norges Bank ($5.31 billion) and Susquehanna International Group ($2.17 billion). So, why didn’t I mention Tesla as the top name among popular hedge fund stocks? Mainly, it’s not clear that everyone should acquire TSLA. It really depends on your risk-reward profile.Objectively, TSLA appears significantly overvalued. At the time of writing, the market prices TSLA at a trailing multiple of 55.44. Also, TSLA trades at a forward multiple of 50.14. Both are overwhelmingly overvalued for the underlying industry. Adding to the pressures, electric vehicles tend to be quite expensive at this juncture. Further, not everyone has access to home charging. Here’s the other thing. Although covering analysts peg TSLA as a consensus moderate buy, their average price target pings at $202.46. That’s less than 1% upside potential. If you believe in it, go for it. However, it might not be for everyone.Charles Schwab (SCHW)man's hand holding wads of cashSource: Vova Shevchuk / Shutterstock.comAnother example of popular hedge fund stock that might not be everyone’s cup of tea is Charles Schwab (NYSE:SCHW). Coming in sixth place, hedge funds acquired $23.93 billion worth of the financial services firm. The top investor was Toronto Dominion Bank at $17.47 billion. The second place belongs to Norges Bank ($1.23 billion) and third to Morgan Stanley ($664.26 million).Overall, SCHW isn’t a bad bet. However, it features confusing fundamentals. On the optimistic front, bear market cycles tend to let the cream rise to the top regarding wealth management businesses. I’ve mentioned this concept several times before. However, it does come with the risk that during down cycles, people tend not to invest. Further, the Federal Reserve poses serious problems. Theoretically, higher interest rates mean greater profitability for financial packages. But it also means fewer incentives to take those packages because of higher borrowing costs. On the Street, analysts peg SCHW as a consensus moderate buy. Further, their average price target stands at $91.05, implying nearly 14% upside potential.Prologis (PLD)hands at desk near laptop computer, with one hand holding a pile of hundred dollar billsSource: shutterstock.com/CC7A real estate investment trust (REIT), Prologis (NYSE:PLD) invests in logistics facilities. Per HedgeFollow.com, Prologis ranks as number 11 among popular hedge fund stocks. Collectively, these institutional investors acquired $18.07 billion worth of PLD stock. Acquiring the most was Vanguard Group at $2.59 billion. Rounding out the top three were BlackRock at $1.72 billion and Cohen &amp; Steers at $1.43 billion.In any other circumstance, Prologis might be a no-brainer acquisition. And for those that believe in the broader post-pandemic economic recovery, it might still be. However, PLD might not be the most appropriate investor for everyone’s needs.Setting aside that it appears objectively overvalued at this juncture, Prologis faces concerns associated with the consumer economy. Should the Fed get too aggressive in its bid to control inflation, the logistics facilities business might suffer. So far, though, Wall Street remains optimistic. Presently, covering analysts peg PLD as a consensus strong buy. Also, their average price target stands at $138.71, implying nearly 13% upside potential.On the date of publication, Josh Enomoto did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.A former senior business analyst for Sony Electronics, Josh Enomoto has helped broker major contracts with Fortune Global 500 companies.

Typically, we'll want to notice a trend of growing return on capital employed (ROCE) and alongside that, an expanding base of capital employed. If you see this, it typically means it's a company with a great business model and plenty of profitable reinvestment opportunities. With that in mind, we've noticed some promising trends at Qorvo (NASDAQ:QRVO) so let's look a bit deeper.Understanding Return On Capital Employed (ROCE)If you haven't worked with ROCE before, it measures the 'return' (pre-tax profit) a company generates from capital employed in its business. To calculate this metric for Qorvo, this is the formula:Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)0.12 = US$749m ÷ (US$7.1b - US$614m) (Based on the trailing twelve months to December 2022).Therefore, Qorvo has an ROCE of 12%. In absolute terms, that's a pretty standard return but compared to the Semiconductor industry average it falls behind. Check out our latest analysis for Qorvo roceAbove you can see how the current ROCE for Qorvo compares to its prior returns on capital, but there's only so much you can tell from the past. If you'd like to see what analysts are forecasting going forward, you should check out our free report for Qorvo.So How Is Qorvo's ROCE Trending?Qorvo is showing promise given that its ROCE is trending up and to the right. The figures show that over the last five years, ROCE has grown 834% whilst employing roughly the same amount of capital. So it's likely that the business is now reaping the full benefits of its past investments, since the capital employed hasn't changed considerably. It's worth looking deeper into this though because while it's great that the business is more efficient, it might also mean that going forward the areas to invest internally for the organic growth are lacking.Story continuesWhat We Can Learn From Qorvo's ROCETo bring it all together, Qorvo has done well to increase the returns it's generating from its capital employed. Since the stock has only returned 24% to shareholders over the last five years, the promising fundamentals may not be recognized yet by investors. So with that in mind, we think the stock deserves further research.One more thing, we've spotted   1 warning sign  facing Qorvo that you might find interesting.While Qorvo isn't earning the highest return, check out this free list of companies that are earning high returns on equity with solid balance sheets.Have feedback on this article?

If you want to see more stocks in this selection, check out Top Investors' Stock Portfolio: 5 Mid-Cap Stocks To Buy. A popular strategy for increasing variety in an investment portfolio is to add smaller company stocks to a portfolio of large company stocks. Although this method is easy to implement and seems reasonable, it ignores the potential benefits that come with investing in medium-sized U.S. companies. Investing in mid-cap U.S. companies has numerous benefits for investors. These include the potential for strong long-term performance, historical outperformance during both up and down market conditions, the opportunity to select individual stocks and add value in a potentially inefficient market, higher returns for the amount of risk taken, a combination of high earnings growth and reasonable valuations, the ability to benefit from mergers and acquisitions, and a high proportion of companies at the optimal stage of their growth cycle.Why Invest in Mid-Cap Stocks?According to John Hancock Investment Management, in the event of an economic downturn, mid-cap value stocks may show resilience due to their ability to set prices for their products or services. These companies have recently experienced lower profit margins due to increased costs for inputs and freight. However, as these pressures ease, mid-cap firms may experience a unique form of margin insulation, where even if demand for cyclical sectors decreases, year-over-year comparisons could still show an increase in margins. This suggests that mid-cap value companies may perform better fundamentally during an economic downturn than would typically be expected. As of the beginning of February 2023, over 80% of the mid-cap companies in which John Hancock Investment Management invests are currently experiencing or are expected to experience positive earnings momentum in the near future. This represents a significant amount of positive momentum and is particularly noteworthy given the low valuations of value stocks over the past decade, as well as what the firm considers to be strong fundamental characteristics across the board.Story continuesIn the past, large-cap companies have tended to receive more attention from analysts, and the trading activity of the largest companies in both large-cap and mid-cap indices indicates a preference for larger-cap stocks. This suggests that many investors have a lower level of exposure to mid-cap stocks. It's important to note that mid-sized companies are essentially mature, but not yet old companies. They have surpassed the vulnerabilities of smaller, newer companies, but they are not as large as mega-cap companies that require more effort to increase return on invested capital. Mid-cap companies often present a great opportunity for stable growth compared to small-cap companies, but they also have the potential for faster growth. Some of the top mid-cap stocks to invest in include Expedia Group, Inc. (NASDAQ:EXPE), Take-Two Interactive Software, Inc. (NASDAQ:TTWO), and CF Industries Holdings, Inc. (NYSE:CF). Our Methodology We selected the following mid-cap stocks, with market caps between $10 billion and $20 billion as of February 24, based on overall hedge fund sentiment toward each stock. We have assessed the hedge fund sentiment from Insider Monkey’s database of 943 elite hedge funds tracked as of the end of the fourth quarter of 2022. The list is arranged in ascending order of the number of hedge fund holders in each firm. Top Investors' Stock Portfolio: 10 Mid-Cap Stocks To BuyPhoto by Austin Distel on UnsplashTop Investors' Stock Portfolio: Mid-Cap Stocks To Buy10. Marathon Oil Corporation (NYSE:MRO)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 48Market Capitalization as of February 24: $16.113 billionMarathon Oil Corporation (NYSE:MRO) is a Texas-based independent exploration and production company that engages in the exploration, production, and marketing of crude oil and condensate, natural gas liquids, and natural gas.

The dividend is payable on March 10, to shareholders of record on February 15. On February 23, Citi analyst Scott Gruber maintained a Neutral rating on Marathon Oil Corporation (NYSE:MRO) but lowered the firm's price target on the shares to $27 from $30. The analyst updated the firm's model following the Q4 results.According to Insider Monkey’s fourth quarter database, 48 hedge funds were long Marathon Oil Corporation (NYSE:MRO), compared to 50 funds in the earlier quarter.

(NASDAQ:EXPE), Take-Two Interactive Software, Inc. (NASDAQ:TTWO), and CF Industries Holdings, Inc. (NYSE:CF), Marathon Oil Corporation (NYSE:MRO) is one of the best mid-cap stocks to invest in. Here is what Carillon Tower Advisers had to say about Marathon Oil Corporation (NYSE:MRO) in its “Carillon Clarivest Capital Appreciation Fund” first-quarter 2022 investor letter:“Stock selection contributed the most while sector allocation was also positive. An underweight to communication services and an overweight to energy helped performance, while an underweight to consumer staples and an overweight to materials detracted. Stock selection was strong within healthcare and materials but was weak within information technology and industrials. Marathon Oil (NYSE:MRO) increased its quarterly dividend and executed an impressive share buyback that blew by the target it originally announced.”9. Cardinal Health, Inc. (NYSE:CAH)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 50Market Capitalization as of February 24: $19.985 billionCardinal Health, Inc. (NYSE:CAH) functions as a provider of healthcare products and services globally including the United States, Canada, Europe, and Asia.

It is one of the best mid-cap stocks to invest in. On February 3, Baird analyst Eric Coldwell upgraded Cardinal Health, Inc. (NYSE:CAH) to Outperform from Neutral with a price target of $94, up from $87. The analyst believes that Cardinal Health, Inc. (NYSE:CAH) has demonstrated its worth as a positive drug distributor in recent quarters. The company's Pharma unit is making progress in narrowing its profit growth gap compared to its peers, while its Medical unit is making steady progress in implementing its turnaround plan. The analyst observed that Cardinal Health, Inc. (NYSE:CAH)’s stock is no longer a ""value trap"" and is now poised for growth.According to Insider Monkey’s fourth quarter database, 50 hedge funds were bullish on Cardinal Health, Inc. (NYSE:CAH), compared to 45 funds in the last quarter. Richard S.

(NYSE:CAH) in its Q3 2022 investor letter:“Additionally, distributor of pharmaceutical and medical products Cardinal Health, Inc. (NYSE:CAH) advanced in the period as leadership changes were viewed to be a positive for shares. Management provided a new profit outlook for Fiscal 2023 and announced an improvement plan for the medical segment. We are encouraged by these changes and think CAH’s underlying fundamentals and competitive advantages around preventative maintenance screenings and medication management will continue to improve. We believe valuations of health care companies like CAH that focus on cost optimization and promote technological efficiency across the supply chain will be rewarded over the long term.”8. Bunge Limited (NYSE:BG)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 50Market Capitalization as of February 24: $14.689 billionBunge Limited (NYSE:BG) is a food company that operates through four segments – Agribusiness, Refined and Specialty Oils, Milling, and Sugar and Bioenergy. On February 23, Bunge Limited (NYSE:BG) declared a quarterly dividend of $0.625 per share, in line with previous. The dividend is payable on June 2, to shareholders of record on May 19.

Although the company exceeded market expectations, it has provided initial 2023 guidance that falls short of Street expectations, according to the analyst. The guidance is probably conservative and represents a starting point for the year, but the shares are likely to remain stagnant in the short term until there is more clarity on 2023 and beyond, the analyst suggested.According to Insider Monkey’s data, 50 hedge funds were bullish on Bunge Limited (NYSE:BG) at the end of December 2022, compared to 48 funds in the prior quarter. Jack Woodruff’s Candlestick Capital Management is the biggest stakeholder of the company, with 1.15 million shares worth $114.7 million. Here is what Old West Investment Management has to say about Bunge Limited (NYSE:BG) in its Q1 2022 investor letter:“Bunge (pronounced BUN-GEE) Ltd (NYSE:BG) is one of the biggest agribusinesses and food companies in the world. There are four worldwide companies that dominate the sector, the others being Archer-Daniels-Midland Cargill, and Dreyfuss. One of our favorite ways to screen for new ideas is following insider buying. When I saw the Form 4 filed by new Bunge CEO Greg Heckman, his purchase of $9 million of BG stock intrigued me. My initial thought was the company gave him the stock as a signing bonus. I contacted BG Investor Relations and asked whether it was a signing bonus or did Heckman actually write a check for $9 million. IR assured me it was his own hard-earned money that he invested in the company he was about to run.Heckman was a long time executive at Conagra Foods who obviously sensed opportunity at BG. One of his first moves as CEO was to move the company’s HQ from New York to St. Louis, right in the middle of America’s breadbasket. BG had been plagued for years with poor decisions by underperforming management. Heckman’s decision to move to St. Louis was indicative of a no-nonsense style and he would commence cutting expenses and selling non-core assets…” (Click here to see the full text)7. Builders FirstSource, Inc. (NYSE:BLDR)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 52Market Capitalization as of February 24: $11.783 billionBuilders FirstSource, Inc. (NYSE:BLDR) was founded in 1998 and is based in Dallas, Texas. The company manufactures and supplies building materials, engineered components, and construction services to professional homebuilders, sub-contractors, and customers in the United States. It is one of the best mid-cap stocks to invest in according to top investors. On February 6, B. Riley analyst Alex Rygiel raised the firm's price target on Builders FirstSource, Inc. (NYSE:BLDR) to $70 from $59 and maintained a Neutral rating on the shares. This move comes after attending the NAHB International Builders' Show, where the analyst saw reasons for optimism in the building materials sector. As a result, the analyst increased targets across the building materials industry to reflect this positivity, the low rate environment, and stronger balance sheets. According to Insider Monkey’s Q4 data, 52 hedge funds were long Builders FirstSource, Inc. (NYSE:BLDR), compared to 49 funds in the prior quarter. Christopher Shackelton and Adam Gray’s Coliseum Capital is the biggest stakeholder of the company, with approximately 3.6 million shares worth $233.3 million. Praetorian Capital made the following comment about Builders FirstSource, Inc. (NYSE:BLDR) in its Q3 2022 investor letter:“Builders FirstSource, Inc. (NYSE:BLDR) produces and distributes building materials, primarily for the home building industry. It trades at a low-single digit cash flow multiple on recent earnings and is using that cash flow to rapidly repurchase shares. One could say that the low multiple is due to peak cyclical earnings. I take a different view and believe that we’re in the early stages of a long-term housing boom caused by migration to low tax states along with a catch-up phase as home construction rates were below trendline over the past decade. I believe that the US needs in excess of 1 million new single-family homes each year, just to provide for population growth, ignoring the other factors. As a result, this business does not appear to be at peak earnings; instead, I believe we are seeing a new baseline for earnings—though the earnings will be quite volatile—particularly if interest rates remain elevated or increase further.”6.

The firm's research suggests that there is a strong demand for Splunk Inc.

(NASDAQ:SPLK). Vulcan Value Partners made the following comment about Splunk Inc. (NASDAQ:SPLK) in its Q4 2022 investor letter:“We exited our position in Splunk Inc. (NASDAQ:SPLK) during the quarter. A number of developments caused us to question whether Splunk’s competitive position was eroding. Splunk is a premium product, and less expensive alternatives have made progress increasing the quality of their offerings. Our research has confirmed Splunk is losing market share to these players, including Microsoft’s Sentinel. Sentinel has made a number of improvements over time and integrates with Microsoft’s other products. Notably, both of Splunk’s Co-Presidents left Splunk in 2022 to work for Microsoft. Splunk’s Chief Financial Officer left a few months later. Before the CFO left, Splunk lowered its annual recurring revenue guidance for the year. While the company attributed the change to the macro environment, we were unable to differentiate to what extent the slowdown was caused by the macro environment versus competitive factors. Based on our primary research and competitive concerns, we no longer had sufficient confidence in Splunk’s value stability. Splunk no longer qualifies for investment, and we exited the position.”   Click to continue reading and see Top Investors' Stock Portfolio: 5 Mid-Cap Stocks To Buy.  Suggested articles:11 Most Profitable Chinese Stocks15 Most Profitable New Stocks Today10 Best Stocks to Buy and Hold for a Lifetime Disclosure: None.

Surprise! dolls to the short-term spot market from the long-term contract market. The company is paying around $1,150 per container - a cost savings of more than $18,000 from peak, Larian said.Volatile spot rates were the first to plummet when pandemic-weary consumers shifted spending from goods to travel and entertainment. Now the gap between spot and contract rates is closing, pressured by the threat of recession and competition to fill ships, said Peter Sand, chief analyst at air and ocean freight rate benchmarking platform Xeneta.Story continuesSHIPPERS' REVENGEWhen demand was booming, carriers raked in record profits by focusing on the most lucrative cargo. Critical customers had to jostle for space and the likes of Walmart, Costco Wholesale Corp and Dollar Tree Inc chartered ships to keep shelves stocked.But the tables have turned, and shippers want payback for ocean cargo costs that quadrupled in some cases.It is ""shippers' revenge,"" said Jon Monroe, an industry consultant and North American representative of Singapore-based Transfar Shipping, whose investors include China e-commerce giant Alibaba.""There was a time when everybody looked for a win-win. COVID threw that right off the tracks,"" he said.Previously loyal customers are aggressively comparison- shopping, spreading their business around and gambling on the spot market, experts said.The nonbinding nature of ocean contracts drives customers or carriers to push for everything they can get when leverage swings their way, said Lawrence Burns, a consultant who formerly handled negotiations for Hyundai Merchant Marine.This time around, importer and exporter shipping managers, whose costs exploded when they were unexpectedly forced into the sky-high spot market, have the upper hand.""They've been called into the CEO's office too many times in the last two years. They're coming back for blood,"" Burns said.Customers and carriers do not often discuss contract talks, but in recent earnings calls officials for Walmart - the No. 1 U.S. container shipper - furniture retailer La-Z-Boy, toy maker Mattel Inc and musical instrument seller Yamaha said they expected to benefit from lower rates.

6,2e475e05-2bd0-37dd-a910-440b13392c55,WMT,2023-02-27,"Walmart, Target and Macy's are part of Zacks Earnings Preview",Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/walmart-target-macys-part-zacks-093409049.html,1677490449,STORY,"['TGT', 'WMT', '^GSPC']","[For Immediate ReleaseChicago, IL – February 27, 2023 – Zacks.com releases the list of companies likely to issue earnings surprises. This week’s list includes Walmart WMT, Target TGT and Macy’s M.Breaking Down Retail Earnings &amp; Consumer Spending TrendsIt is no surprise that the combined weight of elevated inflation, rising interest rates and uncertainty about the economy have forced consumers to change their spending behavior.The issue has undoubtedly been at play with lower-income households for some time now. But we can intuitively appreciate that it will not stay restricted to this consumer segment alone and will most likely move up the income chain in the days ahead.We saw some of that in the Walmart report that showed the retailer benefiting from higher-income consumers ‘trading down’ to its stores in response to the aforementioned headwinds. On the flip side, a big contributor to Walmart’s weak guidance for this year reflects a moderating consumer spending backdrop that some in the market see as overly conservative.The retail business is a tough and competitive space even in ‘normal’ times and these are anything but normal times.They need just the right amount of inventory, otherwise they will either lose sales if they don’t have enough merchandise as was the case earlier in the pandemic or they will need to offer steeper discounts and hurt margins if they have too much of it, as we saw with Walmart and Target last year.Retailers also need to make sure that they have the right type of merchandise, as we saw with Target and Walmart having too much of the patio furniture that consumers weren’t interested in buying. Keeping stores fully staffed in a tight labor market and ensuring just right amount of price discounts are some of the other challenges that big-box operators like Walmart, Target and others face daily.Walmart’s strong performance on the inventory front over the last two quarters is a big reason why the stock has done so much better relative to Target whose results are coming out before the market’s open on Tuesday, February 28th.Story continuesTarget shares are one of those stocks that really move on quarterly releases. The stock was down following each of the last three releases, with the May 18th 2022 report was one for the record books when the stock lost more than a quarter of its value as the company’s inventory and merchandising problems took center stage. This puts a premium on Target’s release Tuesday morning given the stock’s impressive run this year.It all comes down to execution and management effectiveness.In a backdrop of moderating and shifting consumer spending behavior, some retailers have been more successful than others. Walmart has been better, Target less so, though Target shares have been stellar performers in recent weeks. Macy’s, which also reports this week, has been one of the laggards.Since the start of 2023, however, Target shares are up +10.1% vs. +4.5% for the S&amp;P 500 index, while Walmart and Macy’s shares are down -0.6% and -1%, respectively.With respect to the Retail sector’s 2022 Q4 earnings season scorecard, we now have results from 24 of the 33 retailers in the S&amp;P 500 index. Total Q4 earnings for these retailers are down -33% from the same period last year on +6.5% higher revenues, with 70.8% beating EPS estimates and 62.5% beating revenue estimates.Retailers have been struggling to come out with positive surprises thus far, with the variance relative to the historical ranges particularly notable on the EPS side.With respect to the earnings and revenue growth rates, Amazon’s -85.4% earnings decline plays a significant role in the group’s weak year-over-year growth rate for the sector (Amazon is part of the Zacks Retail sector, and not the Zacks Technology sector). Most of the Retail sector earnings reports that have come out already are in the digital part of the space, with the more traditional retailers started the reporting cycle with last week’s Walmart release and a host of others on deck this week.As we all know, the digital and brick-and-mortar operators have been converging for some time now, with Amazon now a decent sized brick-and-mortar operator after Whole Foods and Walmart a growing online vendor. This long-standing trend got a huge boost from the Covid lockdowns.This Week’s Reporting DocketWe have more than 550 companies on deck to report results this week, including 30 S&amp;P 500 members. Notable companies reporting this week, aside from the aforementioned retailers include Berkshire Hathaway, Broadcom, Salesforce.com and others.2022 Q4 Earnings Season ScorecardAs of Friday, February 24th, we now have Q4 results from 468 S&amp;P 500 members or 93.6% of the index’s total membership. Total earnings for these companies are down -5.7% from the same period last year on +6% higher revenues, with 70.7% beating EPS estimates and an equal proportion beating revenue estimates.There is a notable deceleration in the growth trajectory, both for earnings as well as revenues. Please note that this decelerating growth trend doesn’t change in any meaningful way whether we look at it on an ex-Finance or ex-Tech bases.The Earnings Big PictureWe have all along been referring to the overall picture that emerged from the 2022 Q4 reporting cycle as good enough; not great, but not bad either.The revisions trend continues to be negative, with the outlook for a number of sectors on the weak side. But it is consistent with the evolving macroeconomic picture and far from the dire scenario that many in the market feared.Please note that while Q1 estimates are coming down, the pace and magnitude of cuts is notably below what we had seen ahead of the start of the last couple of earnings seasons.Please note that the $1.911 trillion in expected aggregate earnings for the index in 2023 approximate to an index ‘EPS’ of $215.47, down from $215.89 last week and the $215.90 tally we are on track to have seen in 2022.With the bulk of the 2022 Q4 reporting cycle now behind us, revisions have mostly played down for the next few weeks though the Retail sector results will have a bearing on how expectations for that space evolve.We continue to believe that a definitive read on the revisions front will only emerge once we have seen an end to the Fed’s tightening cycle and the impact of the cumulative tightening on economic growth.That said, relative to pre-season doom-and-gloom worries, this is fairly reassuring outcome.Estimates for 2023 are now a hair below the 2022 level.

This investment brings the starting wage in every U.S. market to at least $15 an hour.Meanwhile at the end of January, U.S. retailer Walmart (WMT) announced plans to increase its average hourly pay to more than $17.50, making the range now $14 to $19 per hour.In a statement to U.S. employees, Walmart U.S. CEO and president John Furner said the increase in pay was “to ensure we have attractive pay in the markets we operate.”North Miami Beach, Florida, Walmart discount department store, checkout line, cashier with customer paying . (Photo by: Jeffrey Greenberg/Universal Images Group via Getty Images)Why raise wages now? Oliver Chen, managing director at Cowen, said the decision to increase wages was ""a no brainer"" for the companies ""in a tight labor market with low unemployment.""This boost in higher hourly wages is all part of a trend as retailers ""want less turnover,"" said Chen.In January the retail industry added 30,000 jobs, while the unemployment rate remained low, at 3.4%, far lower than the January 2021 rate of nearly 6.5%.This content is not available due to your privacy preferences.Update your settings here to see it.""The reality of retail — it's a very people-centric business with a lot of frontline workers, so the future of retail is tech-enabled but people centric ... where [brick-and-mortar] meets clicks.""Retail employees are needed to fulfill strong consumer demand despite inflation, added Jharrone Martis, director of consumer research at Refinitiv.Retail sales were up 2.3% on a monthly-basis and up 3.9% compared to last year. For retail overall, including food and beverage, sales month-over-month were up 3.0% in January 2023 to $697 billion and up 6.4% from this time last year.But what do rising wages mean for the companies' bottom lines?In the short-term, higher wages will weigh, said Martis. It's ""almost like the necessary evil,"" Martis said, as the companies see it ""as a long term investment.""Story continuesHigher wages are ""definitely gross margin pressure,"" but longer-term benefits outweigh it, Chen added.""In the short term, you have gross margin, SG&amp;A [selling, general, and administrative expenses] and expense pressure; long term, you have happier employees, and which should translate to happier customers,"" Chen said.Home Depot CEO Edward Decker had a similar message to investors in the company's earnings release, saying that the labor investment is ""enabling us to attract and retain the level of talent needed to sustain the customer experience we strive to deliver.""Martis said big companies like Walmart and Home Depot can take the hit after coming out of the pandemic in a strong position.As far as seeing if other retailers raise wages, Chen said, ""Every retailer has to be very competitive on a market by market basis.""Martis has a similar view. ""If Target and Kroger want to remain competitive, they're going to have to follow suit...Out of those two companies Target is in a much better position for this because they were also a big winner during the pandemic, so it's a company that can take the risk.""Target (TGT) announced a new starting wage range of $15 to $24 last February.For smaller retailers, it gets tricky though, she said. ""For a smaller retailer, that's when you get in trouble. That's when that might hit their margins harder.""—Brooke DiPalma is a reporter for Yahoo Finance.

The Dow endured its worst weekly performance since Sept. 2022.In the week ahead, investors will remain keyed in on the retail sector, with results from Target (TGT) in focus after rival Walmart (WMT) issued a warning on the state of U.S. consumers last week.On the economic data side, a crowded calendar of reports from the housing and manufacturing sectors — two areas of the economy which have most reflected the impact of policy tightening — is on tap along with a key measure of consumer confidence.On Friday, the Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) price index — the Fed's preferred assessment of how quickly prices are rising across the economy — showed prices rose 0.6% during the month of January and 5.4% over last year. On a ""core"" basis, which strips out volatile food and energy components, prices rose 0.6% for the month and at an annual clip of 4.7%.The week marked a turning point in sentiment around inflation expectations and the path forward for interest rates.The hotter-than-expected PCE index followed upside surprises to inflation this year from the Consumer Price Index (CPI) and producer prices, which showed the largest increases in several months to start the year.""The bear market rally that began in October from reasonable prices and low expectations has morphed into a speculative frenzy based on a Fed pause/pivot that isn't coming,"" Morgan Stanley's top strategist Mike Wilson said in a note to clients last week.Wilson's forecast sees the S&amp;P 500 bottoming out at 3,000 this year.

Construction has already begun on 50 gigawatts, six times more than in the rest of the world combined, the researchers said.Read more: China Is Doubling Down on Coal Despite Its Green Ambitions“China continues to be the glaring exception to the ongoing global decline in coal plant development,” said Flora Champenois, an analyst at Global Energy Monitor. “The speed at which projects progressed through permitting to construction in 2022 was extraordinary, with many projects sprouting up, gaining permits, obtaining financing and breaking ground apparently in a matter of months.”The surge in approvals follows severe power shortages last summer, when an epic drought dried up hydropower reservoirs while boosting air conditioning demand. Responding with new coal plants is a “sub-optimal solution,” the researchers said, as the money would be better spent on energy storage, grid upgrades and energy efficiency improvements.Beijing’s willingness to keep investing in coal, in seeming contravention of its broader climate goals, shows an excess of caution when it comes to ensuring energy security. But just because new power plants are being built, it doesn’t mean they will be used.China leads the world in clean energy investments, and once solar panels and wind turbines are operational they’re often used first to generate power because there’s no marginal cost for fuel. If new clean power installations are large enough to cover the growth in electricity use, less dirty coal will be needed and the new plants will be underutilized.Story continues“To meet China’s goal of peaking CO2 emissions, the most urgent milestone is to scale up investments in clean power generation to cover all of power demand growth, which means declining demand for power generation from coal,” said Lauri Myllyvirta, an analyst with the the Centre for Research on Energy and Clean Air.The Week’s Diary(All times Beijing unless noted.)Monday, Feb. 27China Electricity Council online forumEARNINGS: CLP Holdings, Xinyi Solar, YancoalTuesday, Feb. 28Nothing major scheduledWednesday, March 1China official PMIs for February, 09:00Caixin’s China manufacturing PMI for February, 09:45CCTD’s weekly online briefing on China’s coal market, 15:00Thursday, March 2China Carbon Neutral Summit in Shanghai, day 1EARNINGS: Yunnan Energy New MaterialFriday, March 3Caixin’s China services &amp; composite PMIs for February, 09:45China weekly iron ore port stockpilesShanghai exchange weekly commodities inventory, ~15:30China Carbon Neutral Summit in Shanghai, day 2Saturday, March 4Nothing major scheduledSunday, March 5National People’s Congress begins in BeijingOn The WireChina’s economy rebounded in February after the long holiday, although early indicators point to an uneven recovery with strong consumption following the scrapping of Covid rules but lagging industrial activity.Lithium-processing companies in the eastern Chinese city of Yichun suspended production as authorities investigate irregularities in mining of the metal, a key component in electric-vehicle batteries.The city of Tangshan, a steelmaking hub in north China, has started production restrictions to try to clear its skies ahead of some major political meetings in the country.Most Read from Bloomberg BusinessweekThe Green Energy Revolution Needs a 211-Mile Road Through Pristine Alaskan WildernessHigher Interest Rates Slam Stocks and Profits But Spare WorkersGerm-Zapping Lasers Help Cut Down on Infections After SurgeryAfter Multibillion-Dollar Fintech Binge, Wall Street Has a Writedown HangoverHow Ben &amp; Jerry's Ended Up at War With Itself©2023 Bloomberg L.P.]"

Read this and more market news on the go with the Yahoo Finance App.Salesforce is facing a defining moment in its 24-year history.Growth is slowing. Analysts are worried fundamentals will get worse before they get better as companies curtail tech spending amid a sluggish global economy. A fresh round of layoffs at Salesforce have just been uncorked....at a company that has only known aggressive hiring. Employees are questioning leadership at the tech titan.Co-CEO Bret Taylor is no longer co-CEO of Salesforce — instead he's off to launch an AI startup the serial entrepreneur tells me. Slack founder Stewart Butterfield, who stayed on when the company was acquired by Salesforce, is still founder...but no longer with the parent company.Salesforce co-founder Marc Benioff is back at the CEO helm, after attempting again to pullback from day to day duties (by delegating to a co-CEO) and focus more on his vast philanthropic ventures.To top it all off the company is staring down the barrel of five sharks in the field of activist money management: Elliott Management, Starboard Value, Inclusive Capital, ValueAct, and Third Point.This is an unprecedented activist versus public company battle, pros have told Yahoo Finance. How it ends is wildly unclear, but is a situation just as important as Wednesday's earnings report.""While the involvement of five activist investors has likely been the primary driver of CRM stock of late, quarterly results probably still matter (though not as much as usual), and how those results are delivered may be more relevant than ever,"" said Guggenheim analyst John DiFucci.Below, Yahoo Finance breaks down this complicated situation at large-cap tech name Salesforce. The drama is high, and it could all be coming down to one final epic conclusion.Story continuesWhat Yahoo Finance Is Watching: Salesforce EarningsWhat sources tell us is top of mind on the Street:How quickly are sales deteriorating inside of the broader tech pullback?What does the pipeline of future business look like?Does Marc Benioff acknowledge the activist situation?Are more layoffs needed?Consensus is that Salesforce warns on sales and earnings for 2023 – but how bad is it?The Vibe Among Wall Street AnalystsAnalysts are generally expecting a muted tone from Salesforce on earnings day.“For Benioff and Salesforce the actual quarter and FY24 take a back seat to the fluid activist situation which is happening at Salesforce with the Street's patience wearing thin after a head scratcher Slack deal and slowing growth/underachieving margins front and center.” -Wedbush analyst Dan Ives""Key to the Q4 call is gaining clarity on the extent to which management will turn the dial up on non-GAAP operating margins, GAAP profitability, and any future share repurchases with the emergence of activist involvement in the stock."" -Morgan Stanley analyst Keith WeissWhat the Activists Want From SalesforceSources tell Yahoo Finance that Starboard Value — led by veteran activist investor and Papa John's chairman Jeff Smith — has been disappointed in Salesforce’s expense management, but isn’t advocating for a sale of Slack. Other activists involved in the situation are keen to see a Slack sale even at a low price as a show of faith by management they will improve margins, sources say.Overall, we are told the activists are entrenched and want clear changes from Salesforce leadership.Key thing the activist pool wants:Higher profit marginsRealistic 2023 guidanceClear succession plan from CEO co-founder Marc BenioffLike we said, this earnings report is a defining moment in the history of Salesforce.What to Watch TodayEconomyDurable Goods Orders, January Preliminary (-3.8% expected, 5.6% during prior month)Durables Excluding Transportation, January Preliminary (0.1% expected, -0.2% during prior month);Non-defense Capital Goods Orders Excluding Aircraft, January Preliminary (0.0% expected, -0.1% during prior month)Non-defense Capital Goods Shipments Excluding Aircraft, January Preliminary (-0.6% during prior month)Pending Home Sales, month-over-month, January (1.0% expected, 2.5% during prior month)Pending Home Sales NSA, year-over-year, January (-34.3% during prior month)Dallas Fed Manufacturing Activity, February (-9.10 expected, -8.4 during prior month)EarningsGroupon (GRPN), LendingTree (TREE), Li Auto (LI), Lordstown Motors (RIDE), Oak Street Health (OSH), Occidental Petroleum (OXY), Workday (WDAY), Zoom Video (ZM)—Click here for the latest stock market news and in-depth analysis, including events that move stocksRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo FinanceDownload the Yahoo Finance app for Apple or AndroidFollow Yahoo Finance on Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, Flipboard, LinkedIn, and YouTube]"
24,1dee0775-458f-3bf0-92dd-fa4ab84a603c,ALGN,2023-02-27,"Has Align Technology, Inc.'s (NASDAQ:ALGN) Impressive Stock Performance Got Anything to Do With Its Fundamentals?",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/align-technology-inc-nasdaq-algn-135609607.html,1677419769,STORY,['ALGN'],"[Most readers would already be aware that Align Technology's (NASDAQ:ALGN) stock increased significantly by 61% over the past three months. We wonder if and what role the company's financials play in that price change as a company's long-term fundamentals usually dictate market outcomes. In this article, we decided to focus on Align Technology's  ROE.Return on equity or ROE is an important factor to be considered by a shareholder because it tells them how effectively their capital is being reinvested. In simpler terms, it measures the profitability of a company in relation to shareholder's equity. See our latest analysis for Align Technology How To Calculate Return On Equity?The formula for ROE is:Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' EquitySo, based on the above formula, the ROE for Align Technology is:10% = US$362m ÷ US$3.6b (Based on the trailing twelve months to December 2022).The 'return' refers to a company's earnings over the last year. One way to conceptualize this is that for each $1 of shareholders' capital it has, the company made $0.10 in profit.What Is The Relationship Between ROE And Earnings Growth?Thus far, we have learned that ROE measures how efficiently a company is generating its profits. Based on how much of its profits the company chooses to reinvest or ""retain"", we are then able to evaluate a company's future ability to generate profits. Assuming all else is equal, companies that have both a higher return on equity and higher profit retention are usually the ones that have a higher growth rate when compared to companies that don't have the same features.Align Technology's Earnings Growth And 10% ROEAt first glance, Align Technology's ROE doesn't look very promising. However, its ROE is similar to the industry average of 11%, so we won't completely dismiss the company. Even so, Align Technology has shown a fairly decent growth in its net income which grew at a rate of 12%. Taking into consideration that the ROE is not particularly high, we reckon that there could also be other factors at play which could be influencing the company's growth. For instance, the company has a low payout ratio or is being managed efficiently.Story continuesWe then compared Align Technology's net income growth with the industry and found that the company's growth figure is lower than the average industry growth rate of 16% in the same period, which is a bit concerning.past-earnings-growthEarnings growth is a huge factor in stock valuation. It’s important for an investor to know whether the market has priced in the company's expected earnings growth (or decline). By doing so, they will have an idea if the stock is headed into clear blue waters or if swampy waters await. One good indicator of expected earnings growth is the P/E ratio which determines the price the market is willing to pay for a stock based on its earnings prospects. So, you may want to check if Align Technology is trading on a high P/E or a low P/E, relative to its industry.Is Align Technology Making Efficient Use Of Its Profits?Align Technology doesn't pay any dividend, meaning that all of its profits are being reinvested in the business, which explains the fair bit of earnings growth the company has seen.ConclusionIn total, it does look like Align Technology has some positive aspects to its business. Specifically, its fairly high earnings growth number, which no doubt was backed by the company's high earnings retention. Still, the low ROE means that all that reinvestment is not reaping a lot of benefit to the investors. Having said that, looking at the current analyst estimates, we found that the company's earnings are expected to gain momentum.

If you want to see more stocks in this selection, check out Top Investors' Stock Portfolio: 5 Mid-Cap Stocks To Buy. A popular strategy for increasing variety in an investment portfolio is to add smaller company stocks to a portfolio of large company stocks. Although this method is easy to implement and seems reasonable, it ignores the potential benefits that come with investing in medium-sized U.S. companies. Investing in mid-cap U.S. companies has numerous benefits for investors. These include the potential for strong long-term performance, historical outperformance during both up and down market conditions, the opportunity to select individual stocks and add value in a potentially inefficient market, higher returns for the amount of risk taken, a combination of high earnings growth and reasonable valuations, the ability to benefit from mergers and acquisitions, and a high proportion of companies at the optimal stage of their growth cycle.Why Invest in Mid-Cap Stocks?According to John Hancock Investment Management, in the event of an economic downturn, mid-cap value stocks may show resilience due to their ability to set prices for their products or services. These companies have recently experienced lower profit margins due to increased costs for inputs and freight. However, as these pressures ease, mid-cap firms may experience a unique form of margin insulation, where even if demand for cyclical sectors decreases, year-over-year comparisons could still show an increase in margins. This suggests that mid-cap value companies may perform better fundamentally during an economic downturn than would typically be expected. As of the beginning of February 2023, over 80% of the mid-cap companies in which John Hancock Investment Management invests are currently experiencing or are expected to experience positive earnings momentum in the near future. This represents a significant amount of positive momentum and is particularly noteworthy given the low valuations of value stocks over the past decade, as well as what the firm considers to be strong fundamental characteristics across the board.Story continuesIn the past, large-cap companies have tended to receive more attention from analysts, and the trading activity of the largest companies in both large-cap and mid-cap indices indicates a preference for larger-cap stocks. This suggests that many investors have a lower level of exposure to mid-cap stocks. It's important to note that mid-sized companies are essentially mature, but not yet old companies. They have surpassed the vulnerabilities of smaller, newer companies, but they are not as large as mega-cap companies that require more effort to increase return on invested capital. Mid-cap companies often present a great opportunity for stable growth compared to small-cap companies, but they also have the potential for faster growth. Some of the top mid-cap stocks to invest in include Expedia Group, Inc. (NASDAQ:EXPE), Take-Two Interactive Software, Inc. (NASDAQ:TTWO), and CF Industries Holdings, Inc. (NYSE:CF). Our Methodology We selected the following mid-cap stocks, with market caps between $10 billion and $20 billion as of February 24, based on overall hedge fund sentiment toward each stock. We have assessed the hedge fund sentiment from Insider Monkey’s database of 943 elite hedge funds tracked as of the end of the fourth quarter of 2022. The list is arranged in ascending order of the number of hedge fund holders in each firm. Top Investors' Stock Portfolio: 10 Mid-Cap Stocks To BuyPhoto by Austin Distel on UnsplashTop Investors' Stock Portfolio: Mid-Cap Stocks To Buy10.

(NASDAQ:EXPE), Take-Two Interactive Software, Inc. (NASDAQ:TTWO), and CF Industries Holdings, Inc.

An underweight to communication services and an overweight to energy helped performance, while an underweight to consumer staples and an overweight to materials detracted. Stock selection was strong within healthcare and materials but was weak within information technology and industrials. Marathon Oil (NYSE:MRO) increased its quarterly dividend and executed an impressive share buyback that blew by the target it originally announced.”9. Cardinal Health, Inc. (NYSE:CAH)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 50Market Capitalization as of February 24: $19.985 billionCardinal Health, Inc. (NYSE:CAH) functions as a provider of healthcare products and services globally including the United States, Canada, Europe, and Asia.

We are encouraged by these changes and think CAH’s underlying fundamentals and competitive advantages around preventative maintenance screenings and medication management will continue to improve. We believe valuations of health care companies like CAH that focus on cost optimization and promote technological efficiency across the supply chain will be rewarded over the long term.”8. Bunge Limited (NYSE:BG)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 50Market Capitalization as of February 24: $14.689 billionBunge Limited (NYSE:BG) is a food company that operates through four segments – Agribusiness, Refined and Specialty Oils, Milling, and Sugar and Bioenergy. On February 23, Bunge Limited (NYSE:BG) declared a quarterly dividend of $0.625 per share, in line with previous. The dividend is payable on June 2, to shareholders of record on May 19.

Although the company exceeded market expectations, it has provided initial 2023 guidance that falls short of Street expectations, according to the analyst. The guidance is probably conservative and represents a starting point for the year, but the shares are likely to remain stagnant in the short term until there is more clarity on 2023 and beyond, the analyst suggested.According to Insider Monkey’s data, 50 hedge funds were bullish on Bunge Limited (NYSE:BG) at the end of December 2022, compared to 48 funds in the prior quarter. Jack Woodruff’s Candlestick Capital Management is the biggest stakeholder of the company, with 1.15 million shares worth $114.7 million. Here is what Old West Investment Management has to say about Bunge Limited (NYSE:BG) in its Q1 2022 investor letter:“Bunge (pronounced BUN-GEE) Ltd (NYSE:BG) is one of the biggest agribusinesses and food companies in the world. There are four worldwide companies that dominate the sector, the others being Archer-Daniels-Midland Cargill, and Dreyfuss. One of our favorite ways to screen for new ideas is following insider buying. When I saw the Form 4 filed by new Bunge CEO Greg Heckman, his purchase of $9 million of BG stock intrigued me. My initial thought was the company gave him the stock as a signing bonus. I contacted BG Investor Relations and asked whether it was a signing bonus or did Heckman actually write a check for $9 million. IR assured me it was his own hard-earned money that he invested in the company he was about to run.Heckman was a long time executive at Conagra Foods who obviously sensed opportunity at BG. One of his first moves as CEO was to move the company’s HQ from New York to St. Louis, right in the middle of America’s breadbasket. BG had been plagued for years with poor decisions by underperforming management. Heckman’s decision to move to St. Louis was indicative of a no-nonsense style and he would commence cutting expenses and selling non-core assets…” (Click here to see the full text)7. Builders FirstSource, Inc. (NYSE:BLDR)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 52Market Capitalization as of February 24: $11.783 billionBuilders FirstSource, Inc. (NYSE:BLDR) was founded in 1998 and is based in Dallas, Texas. The company manufactures and supplies building materials, engineered components, and construction services to professional homebuilders, sub-contractors, and customers in the United States. It is one of the best mid-cap stocks to invest in according to top investors. On February 6, B. Riley analyst Alex Rygiel raised the firm's price target on Builders FirstSource, Inc. (NYSE:BLDR) to $70 from $59 and maintained a Neutral rating on the shares. This move comes after attending the NAHB International Builders' Show, where the analyst saw reasons for optimism in the building materials sector. As a result, the analyst increased targets across the building materials industry to reflect this positivity, the low rate environment, and stronger balance sheets. According to Insider Monkey’s Q4 data, 52 hedge funds were long Builders FirstSource, Inc. (NYSE:BLDR), compared to 49 funds in the prior quarter. Christopher Shackelton and Adam Gray’s Coliseum Capital is the biggest stakeholder of the company, with approximately 3.6 million shares worth $233.3 million. Praetorian Capital made the following comment about Builders FirstSource, Inc. (NYSE:BLDR) in its Q3 2022 investor letter:“Builders FirstSource, Inc. (NYSE:BLDR) produces and distributes building materials, primarily for the home building industry. It trades at a low-single digit cash flow multiple on recent earnings and is using that cash flow to rapidly repurchase shares. One could say that the low multiple is due to peak cyclical earnings. I take a different view and believe that we’re in the early stages of a long-term housing boom caused by migration to low tax states along with a catch-up phase as home construction rates were below trendline over the past decade. I believe that the US needs in excess of 1 million new single-family homes each year, just to provide for population growth, ignoring the other factors. As a result, this business does not appear to be at peak earnings; instead, I believe we are seeing a new baseline for earnings—though the earnings will be quite volatile—particularly if interest rates remain elevated or increase further.”6. Splunk Inc. (NASDAQ:SPLK)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 52Market Capitalization as of February 24: $16.681 billionSplunk Inc. (NASDAQ:SPLK) is a California-based provider of software and cloud solutions that deliver and operationalize insights from the data generated by digital systems in the United States and internationally. On February 1, Splunk Inc. (NASDAQ:SPLK) announced that it will be laying off approximately 4% of its employees worldwide, with a focus on North America. This move is part of a restructuring effort aimed at improving its operational efficiency and reducing costs.On February 22, Brad Sills, an analyst at Bank of America, increased the firm's price target for Splunk Inc. (NASDAQ:SPLK) from $110 to $125. He maintained a Buy rating on the shares and has adjusted the estimates after conducting channel checks with Splunk's SI partners following the Q4 close. The firm's research suggests that there is a strong demand for Splunk Inc. (NASDAQ:SPLK), which is expected to result in increased annual recurring revenue.According to Insider Monkey’s fourth quarter database, 52 hedge funds were bullish on Splunk Inc. (NASDAQ:SPLK), compared to 46 funds in the prior quarter. Alex Sacerdote’s Whale Rock Capital Management is a prominent stakeholder of the company, with 2.5 million shares worth $217.3 million. In addition to Expedia Group, Inc. (NASDAQ:EXPE), Take-Two Interactive Software, Inc. (NASDAQ:TTWO), and CF Industries Holdings, Inc. (NYSE:CF), elite investors are piling into Splunk Inc. (NASDAQ:SPLK). Vulcan Value Partners made the following comment about Splunk Inc. (NASDAQ:SPLK) in its Q4 2022 investor letter:“We exited our position in Splunk Inc. (NASDAQ:SPLK) during the quarter. A number of developments caused us to question whether Splunk’s competitive position was eroding. Splunk is a premium product, and less expensive alternatives have made progress increasing the quality of their offerings. Our research has confirmed Splunk is losing market share to these players, including Microsoft’s Sentinel. Sentinel has made a number of improvements over time and integrates with Microsoft’s other products. Notably, both of Splunk’s Co-Presidents left Splunk in 2022 to work for Microsoft. Splunk’s Chief Financial Officer left a few months later. Before the CFO left, Splunk lowered its annual recurring revenue guidance for the year. While the company attributed the change to the macro environment, we were unable to differentiate to what extent the slowdown was caused by the macro environment versus competitive factors. Based on our primary research and competitive concerns, we no longer had sufficient confidence in Splunk’s value stability. Splunk no longer qualifies for investment, and we exited the position.”   Click to continue reading and see Top Investors' Stock Portfolio: 5 Mid-Cap Stocks To Buy.  Suggested articles:11 Most Profitable Chinese Stocks15 Most Profitable New Stocks Today10 Best Stocks to Buy and Hold for a Lifetime Disclosure: None.

One, Zholia Alemi, who was convicted of fraud earlier this month was described by the Judge as “a most accomplished forger and fraudster [who] has no qualification that would allow her to be called, or in any way to be properly regarded as, a doctor”. Yet she had graced the NHS as a psychiatrist for over two decades.The most notorious, Christopher Duntsch, an American neurosurgeon became the subject of a harrowing podcast and TV series, Dr Death. He maimed or killed patients in 33 of his 38 operations.Each time we ask: how could they get away with it for so long? And we can guess the answer without knowing the specifics: the fraudster has a supremely confident manner which calms doubts, while the doctor’s high social status very effectively rebuts criticism.So what happens when a machine or a new technology is an imposter? We’re actually in the middle of finding out, and the similarities are spooky.In just a few weeks, the artificial intelligence software ChatGPT made by OpenAI has had a sensational media impact. Given a short prompt, it creates plausible sounding text: letters, essays, computer code, and even poems that rhyme.Seeking to put one over on arch rival Google, Microsoft rushed to add some ChatGPT smarts to its Bing web search engine. Microsoft’s CEO Satya Nadella even indulged in some very public goading: “I want people to know that we made [Google] dance, and I think that'll be a great day,” he said. Nadella’s taunt may be premature.Errors in Google rushed-to-market AI search chatbot saw the market wipe $100 billion from the value of its parent company Alphabet. But those errors seem trivial compared to the performance of Microsoft’s Bing’s AI Chat over the past fortnight. We’re watching one of the most spectacular technology implosions of all time.Satya Nadella, chief executive officer of Microsoft Corp., gestures as he speaks during a panel session on day two of the World Economic Forum - Jason Alden / BloombergBing Chat began to hallucinate. It assured us that we could safely eat ground glass, and that four US Presidents had been women. It would invent citations.  It would then deny an answer it had just given you was true. All this was performed with the smoothly reassuring bedside manner of an experienced NHS consultant.Story continuesThings got even worse as Bing Chat began to throw tantrums, and even threaten its users. The real story is now being pieced together. It appears that giddy with enthusiasm, Microsoft hastily bolted an existing chatbot called Sydney onto the OpenAI model, and used different training data. In its desire “to make Google dance”, it had surrendered all caution – the mark of a supremely confident operator, or a psychopath. Yet such confidence is an act of concealment.The technology is really exceptionally dumb – at its core, no more than a statistical word completion algorithm.“Without understanding what’s in a picture, the AI easily makes false associations, or worse, heads up a blind alley,” economics professor Gary Smith notes. Smith was not speaking this year, however, but describing the limitations to me for The Telegraph in late 2019 – over three years ago.Other distinguished critics cited including Gary Marcus and Melanie Mitchell, who had both just published cautionary books explaining AI. We also reported how OpenAI already had a reputation for showpiece stunts that went wrong.In short, all the clues were there. This year one of the more bullish academic forefathers of modern AI, Yann LeCun, has turned sceptical, describing the LLM approach as a dead end on the way to intelligent machines.But few wanted to know, with the sprawling new “AI ethics” community conspicuous by its absence. This is a field dominated by arts graduates, which prefers to speculate on hypothetical future problems, rather than the very real ones before us – rather like some negligent professional committee that always gives a bogus Doctor the benefit of the doubt, before sending them back to the ward.Former Google chairman Eric Schmidt - Lucy Nicholson / REUTERSThe other shoe has yet to drop. Artificial Intelligence today is very fashionable with high status opinions, particularly the laptop elites of Davos. Former Google chairman Eric Schmidt, who has an outsized influence on US science policy, is urging widespread deployment across government and even the military.A policy master plan written for The Tony Blair Institute spoke of AI in Promethean terms, comparing it to “an alien form of intelligence we do not yet fully understand”. Now do you believe Mr Blair and Mr Hague, or what your own lying eyes are telling you when you use Bing Chat, and it invites you to eat glass?This wild disconnect is what convinced a talented PhD working on AI problems to give up the very lucrative work for a year to write a book, and the result, called Smart Until It’s Dumb, is the most lucid layman’s account of AI and its limitations I have found.Its author Emmanuel Maggiori compares it to the era when string theory dominated physics, and all criticism was dispelled. That too was a dead end. “What worries me the most is this fanatical, almost religious behaviour,” he told me, which sees skilled graduates be “hired for projects that go nowhere, while people have to fake and lie” about how well it went.While we can be assured most bogus doctors are eventually uncovered, capturing the rogue bot may take longer: they have some friends in very high places.]"

Follow Sozzi on Twitter @BrianSozzi and on LinkedIn. Read this and more market news on the go with the Yahoo Finance App.Salesforce is facing a defining moment in its 24-year history.Growth is slowing. Analysts are worried fundamentals will get worse before they get better as companies curtail tech spending amid a sluggish global economy. A fresh round of layoffs at Salesforce have just been uncorked....at a company that has only known aggressive hiring. Employees are questioning leadership at the tech titan.Co-CEO Bret Taylor is no longer co-CEO of Salesforce — instead he's off to launch an AI startup the serial entrepreneur tells me. Slack founder Stewart Butterfield, who stayed on when the company was acquired by Salesforce, is still founder...but no longer with the parent company.Salesforce co-founder Marc Benioff is back at the CEO helm, after attempting again to pullback from day to day duties (by delegating to a co-CEO) and focus more on his vast philanthropic ventures.To top it all off the company is staring down the barrel of five sharks in the field of activist money management: Elliott Management, Starboard Value, Inclusive Capital, ValueAct, and Third Point.This is an unprecedented activist versus public company battle, pros have told Yahoo Finance. How it ends is wildly unclear, but is a situation just as important as Wednesday's earnings report.""While the involvement of five activist investors has likely been the primary driver of CRM stock of late, quarterly results probably still matter (though not as much as usual), and how those results are delivered may be more relevant than ever,"" said Guggenheim analyst John DiFucci.Below, Yahoo Finance breaks down this complicated situation at large-cap tech name Salesforce. The drama is high, and it could all be coming down to one final epic conclusion.Story continuesWhat Yahoo Finance Is Watching: Salesforce EarningsWhat sources tell us is top of mind on the Street:How quickly are sales deteriorating inside of the broader tech pullback?What does the pipeline of future business look like?Does Marc Benioff acknowledge the activist situation?Are more layoffs needed?Consensus is that Salesforce warns on sales and earnings for 2023 – but how bad is it?The Vibe Among Wall Street AnalystsAnalysts are generally expecting a muted tone from Salesforce on earnings day.“For Benioff and Salesforce the actual quarter and FY24 take a back seat to the fluid activist situation which is happening at Salesforce with the Street's patience wearing thin after a head scratcher Slack deal and slowing growth/underachieving margins front and center.” -Wedbush analyst Dan Ives""Key to the Q4 call is gaining clarity on the extent to which management will turn the dial up on non-GAAP operating margins, GAAP profitability, and any future share repurchases with the emergence of activist involvement in the stock."" -Morgan Stanley analyst Keith WeissWhat the Activists Want From SalesforceSources tell Yahoo Finance that Starboard Value — led by veteran activist investor and Papa John's chairman Jeff Smith — has been disappointed in Salesforce’s expense management, but isn’t advocating for a sale of Slack. Other activists involved in the situation are keen to see a Slack sale even at a low price as a show of faith by management they will improve margins, sources say.Overall, we are told the activists are entrenched and want clear changes from Salesforce leadership.Key thing the activist pool wants:Higher profit marginsRealistic 2023 guidanceClear succession plan from CEO co-founder Marc BenioffLike we said, this earnings report is a defining moment in the history of Salesforce.What to Watch TodayEconomyDurable Goods Orders, January Preliminary (-3.8% expected, 5.6% during prior month)Durables Excluding Transportation, January Preliminary (0.1% expected, -0.2% during prior month);Non-defense Capital Goods Orders Excluding Aircraft, January Preliminary (0.0% expected, -0.1% during prior month)Non-defense Capital Goods Shipments Excluding Aircraft, January Preliminary (-0.6% during prior month)Pending Home Sales, month-over-month, January (1.0% expected, 2.5% during prior month)Pending Home Sales NSA, year-over-year, January (-34.3% during prior month)Dallas Fed Manufacturing Activity, February (-9.10 expected, -8.4 during prior month)EarningsGroupon (GRPN), LendingTree (TREE), Li Auto (LI), Lordstown Motors (RIDE), Oak Street Health (OSH), Occidental Petroleum (OXY), Workday (WDAY), Zoom Video (ZM)—Click here for the latest stock market news and in-depth analysis, including events that move stocksRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo FinanceDownload the Yahoo Finance app for Apple or AndroidFollow Yahoo Finance on Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, Flipboard, LinkedIn, and YouTube]"

(NYSE:LUV) reflect what it's really worth? Today, we will estimate the stock's intrinsic value by taking the expected future cash flows and discounting them to today's value. We will take advantage of the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model for this purpose. There's really not all that much to it, even though it might appear quite complex.Remember though, that there are many ways to estimate a company's value, and a DCF is just one method. If you want to learn more about discounted cash flow, the rationale behind this calculation can be read in detail in the Simply Wall St analysis model. See our latest analysis for Southwest Airlines What's The Estimated Valuation?We use what is known as a 2-stage model, which simply means we have two different periods of growth rates for the company's cash flows. Generally the first stage is higher growth, and the second stage is a lower growth phase. To start off with, we need to estimate the next ten years of cash flows. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.Generally we assume that a dollar today is more valuable than a dollar in the future, and so the sum of these future cash flows is then discounted to today's value:10-year free cash flow (FCF) forecast2023202420252026202720282029203020312032 Levered FCF ($, Millions) -US$997.8mUS$551.0mUS$1.10bUS$704.0mUS$1.69bUS$2.06bUS$2.38bUS$2.66bUS$2.89bUS$3.09bGrowth Rate Estimate SourceAnalyst x5Analyst x6Analyst x3Analyst x1Analyst x1Est @ 21.62%Est @ 15.75%Est @ 11.65%Est @ 8.77%Est @ 6.76% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 8.1% -US$923US$472US$870US$516US$1.1kUS$1.3kUS$1.4kUS$1.4kUS$1.4kUS$1.4k(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$9.0bStory continuesWe now need to calculate the Terminal Value, which accounts for all the future cash flows after this ten year period. The Gordon Growth formula is used to calculate Terminal Value at a future annual growth rate equal to the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield of 2.1%. We discount the terminal cash flows to today's value at a cost of equity of 8.1%.Terminal Value (TV)= FCF2032 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$3.1b× (1 + 2.1%) ÷ (8.1%– 2.1%) = US$52bPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$52b÷ ( 1 + 8.1%)10= US$24bThe total value is the sum of cash flows for the next ten years plus the discounted terminal value, which results in the Total Equity Value, which in this case is US$33b. To get the intrinsic value per share, we divide this by the total number of shares outstanding. Relative to the current share price of US$33.6, the company appears quite good value at a 40% discount to where the stock price trades currently. Valuations are imprecise instruments though, rather like a telescope - move a few degrees and end up in a different galaxy. Do keep this in mind.dcfImportant AssumptionsThe calculation above is very dependent on two assumptions. The first is the discount rate and the other is the cash flows. Part of investing is coming up with your own evaluation of a company's future performance, so try the calculation yourself and check your own assumptions. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Southwest Airlines as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 8.1%, which is based on a levered beta of 1.012. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.SWOT Analysis for Southwest AirlinesStrengthDebt is not viewed as a risk.WeaknessEarnings declined over the past year.Dividend is low compared to the top 25% of dividend payers in the Airlines market.OpportunityAnnual earnings are forecast to grow faster than the American market.Trading below our estimate of fair value by more than 20%.ThreatPaying a dividend but company has no free cash flows.Annual revenue is forecast to grow slower than the American market.Moving On:Although the valuation of a company is important, it shouldn't be the only metric you look at when researching a company. DCF models are not the be-all and end-all of investment valuation. Rather it should be seen as a guide to ""what assumptions need to be true for this stock to be under/overvalued?"" For instance, if the terminal value growth rate is adjusted slightly, it can dramatically alter the overall result. What is the reason for the share price sitting below the intrinsic value? For Southwest Airlines, there are three essential aspects you should further examine:Risks: Consider for instance, the ever-present spectre of investment risk.

(NYSE:SPG) insiders placed bullish bets worth US$1.4m in the last 12 months",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/simon-property-group-inc-nyse-110017209.html,1677495617,STORY,['SPG'],"[Usually, when one insider buys stock, it might not be a monumental event. But when multiple insiders are buying like they did in the case of Simon Property Group, Inc. (NYSE:SPG), that sends out a positive message to the company's shareholders.Although we don't think shareholders should simply follow insider transactions, we do think it is perfectly logical to keep tabs on what insiders are doing. See our latest analysis for Simon Property Group Simon Property Group Insider Transactions Over The Last YearThe Independent Director J. Smith made the biggest insider purchase in the last 12 months. That single transaction was for US$74k worth of shares at a price of US$116 each. So it's clear an insider wanted to buy, at around the current price, which is US$122. While their view may have changed since the purchase was made, this does at least suggest they have had confidence in the company's future. If someone buys shares at well below current prices, it's a good sign on balance, but keep in mind they may no longer see value. Happily, the Simon Property Group insiders decided to buy shares at close to current prices.Simon Property Group insiders may have bought shares in the last year, but they didn't sell any. The chart below shows insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last year. If you want to know exactly who sold, for how much, and when, simply click on the graph below!insider-trading-volumeSimon Property Group is not the only stock that insiders are buying. For those who like to find winning investments this free list of growing companies with recent insider purchasing, could be just the ticket.Insiders At Simon Property Group Have Bought Stock RecentlyOver the last three months, we've seen significant insider buying at Simon Property Group. In total, insiders bought US$393k worth of shares in that time, and we didn't record any sales whatsoever. This could be interpreted as suggesting a positive outlook.Does Simon Property Group Boast High Insider Ownership?Another way to test the alignment between the leaders of a company and other shareholders is to look at how many shares they own. Usually, the higher the insider ownership, the more likely it is that insiders will be incentivised to build the company for the long term. It's great to see that Simon Property Group insiders own 0.5% of the company, worth about US$233m. This kind of significant ownership by insiders does generally increase the chance that the company is run in the interest of all shareholders.Story continuesSo What Do The Simon Property Group Insider Transactions Indicate?It's certainly positive to see the recent insider purchases. And an analysis of the transactions over the last year also gives us confidence. When combined with notable insider ownership, these factors suggest Simon Property Group insiders are well aligned, and quite possibly think the share price is too low. One for the watchlist, at least! So these insider transactions can help us build a thesis about the stock, but it's also worthwhile knowing the risks facing this company. Every company has risks, and we've spotted 1 warning sign for Simon Property Group you should know about.But note: Simon Property Group may not be the best stock to buy. So take a peek at this free list of interesting companies with high ROE and low debt.For the purposes of this article, insiders are those individuals who report their transactions to the relevant regulatory body.

V, Mastercard Inc. MA, Fiserv, Inc. FISV, Global Payments Inc. GPN and Equifax Inc. EFX.Industry: Financial Transaction ServicesLink: https://www.zacks.com/commentary/2058588/5-financial-transaction-stocks-to-gain-from-rising-digitizationThe Financial Transaction Services industry is expected to benefit from growing transaction volumes, stemming from improved consumer spending and rebounding cross-border travels. Increased digitization across every sphere of life provides industry players with the perfect ground to capitalize on by leveraging their advanced digital prowess.Continuous pursuit of a merger and acquisition (M&amp;A) strategy coupled with technology investments enables the players to devise a solid digital solutions suite. Companies like Visa Inc., Mastercard Inc., Fiserv, Inc., Global Payments Inc. and Equifax Inc. are well-placed to gain from the growth prospects of the industry.About the IndustryThe Zacks Financial Transaction Services industry is part of the Financial Technology or the FinTech space, which includes companies with varying natures of businesses. The industry comprises card and payment processing and other solutions providers, ATM services and money remittance service providers, and providers of investment solutions to financial advisors.The players in this segment operate their unique and proprietary global payments network that links issuers and acquirers around the globe to facilitate the switching of transactions, permitting account holders to use their products at millions of acceptance locations. Monetary transactions are executed through these networks, offering a convenient, quick and secure payment method in several currencies across the globe. The industry is benefiting from the ongoing digitization movement, triggered by the pandemic.4 Trends Defining Future of the Financial Transaction Services IndustryWidespread Uptake of Contactless Payments: One of the most prominent trends noticed since the coronavirus outbreak is people’s inclination toward adopting digital means across every sphere of life. With the cost-effective nature and ease of digital payments, there is no sign of the digital trend fading away anytime soon. Several flexible digital payment options, ranging from buy now, pay later (BNPL) solutions, cryptocurrency, biometrics, to QR code utilization, which consumers were earlier skeptical of, have started gaining popularity.Story continuesAs a result, the financial transaction services industry players have been actively undertaking significant investments for building an upgraded suite and subsequently, attracting new clients as well as retaining the existing ones. Though the investments might result in escalating costs for the industry participants, digital prowess continues to fetch regular revenues and drives their margins in the long term.Better Consumer Spending: Substantial personal savings made during the pandemic enable continued consumer spending despite looming fears of inflation and recession. Strong wage gains resulting from a tight labor market have positively influenced the purchasing power of consumers. The affinity of people to spend more implies increased utilization of product and service offerings of financial transaction service players.This, in turn, boosts transaction volumes that contribute significantly to the revenues of industry participants. According to the 2023 Annual U.S. Economic Outlook issued by one of the digital payments leaders, Visa, consumer spending in the first half of 2023 is expected to remain higher than the 2022 figure and gradually pick up in the latter part of the year.Improved Cross-Border Travel: The receding impact of the pandemic led to the easing of border restrictions and renewed confidence in travel. These factors have led to a recovery in international travel, thus driving cross-border volumes of companies in the financial transaction services space that engage in global money transfers.Industry participants having exposure to the cross-border business leave no stone unturned to devise platforms backed by an interconnected banking network and sound expertise in the seamless processing of digital payments. Amid the ongoing recovery of cross-border travel, these platforms inevitably reap benefits for the players.An Active M&amp;A Strategy: Participants of the financial transaction services space frequently resort to the M&amp;A strategy to upgrade their capabilities in addition to making uninterrupted technology investments. The strategy reflects industry players’ focus on bolstering their customer base, entering new markets and establishing a significant share across the global market.The primary aim behind these deals is to bring about diversification benefits that differentiate an organization from its industry peers. The current year is expected to be exciting, with respect to M&amp;A deals, according to PwC’s Global M&amp;A Industry Trends: 2023 Outlook.Zacks Industry Rank Instills OptimismThe group’s Zacks Industry Rank, which is basically the average of the Zacks Rank of all-member stocks, indicates bright near-term prospects.

48,d337907f-d440-36d3-ab85-f2d84fc7981b,TJX,2023-02-27,TJX Companies' (NYSE:TJX) five-year total shareholder returns outpace the underlying earnings growth,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/tjx-companies-nyse-tjx-five-110030154.html,1677495630,STORY,['TJX'],"[Generally speaking the aim of active stock picking is to find companies that provide returns that are superior to the market average. And in our experience, buying the right stocks can give your wealth a significant boost. For example, the The TJX Companies, Inc. (NYSE:TJX) share price is up 84% in the last 5 years, clearly besting the market return of around 42% (ignoring dividends). However, more recent returns haven't been as impressive as that, with the stock returning just 19% in the last year , including dividends .While this past week has detracted from the company's five-year return, let's look at the recent trends of the underlying business and see if the gains have been in alignment. See our latest analysis for TJX Companies There is no denying that markets are sometimes efficient, but prices do not always reflect underlying business performance. One flawed but reasonable way to assess how sentiment around a company has changed is to compare the earnings per share (EPS) with the share price.Over half a decade, TJX Companies managed to grow its earnings per share at 8.1% a year. This EPS growth is lower than the 13% average annual increase in the share price. This suggests that market participants hold the company in higher regard, these days. That's not necessarily surprising considering the five-year track record of earnings growth.The company's earnings per share (over time) is depicted in the image below (click to see the exact numbers).earnings-per-share-growthIt might be well worthwhile taking a look at our free report on TJX Companies' earnings, revenue and cash flow.What About Dividends?As well as measuring the share price return, investors should also consider the total shareholder return (TSR). The TSR incorporates the value of any spin-offs or discounted capital raisings, along with any dividends, based on the assumption that the dividends are reinvested. Arguably, the TSR gives a more comprehensive picture of the return generated by a stock. In the case of TJX Companies, it has a TSR of 97% for the last 5 years. That exceeds its share price return that we previously mentioned. The dividends paid by the company have thusly boosted the total shareholder return.Story continuesA Different PerspectiveWe're pleased to report that TJX Companies shareholders have received a total shareholder return of 19% over one year. Of course, that includes the dividend. Since the one-year TSR is better than the five-year TSR (the latter coming in at 15% per year), it would seem that the stock's performance has improved in recent times. In the best case scenario, this may hint at some real business momentum, implying that now could be a great time to delve deeper. I find it very interesting to look at share price over the long term as a proxy for business performance. But to truly gain insight, we need to consider other information, too. Consider for instance, the ever-present spectre of investment risk.   We've identified 1 warning sign  with TJX Companies , and understanding them should be part of your investment process.Of course TJX Companies may not be the best stock to buy.

49,9986a937-82ee-3634-b74a-b30f046fbfce,AMGN,2023-02-27,Amgen Inc. (NASDAQ:AMGN) Shares Could Be 37% Below Their Intrinsic Value Estimate,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/amgen-inc-nasdaq-amgn-shares-130047929.html,1677416447,STORY,['AMGN'],"[Key InsightsThe projected fair value for Amgen is US$371 based on 2 Stage Free Cash Flow to EquityCurrent share price of US$234 suggests Amgen is potentially 37% undervalued The US$255 analyst price target for AMGN is 31% less than our estimate of fair valueToday we will run through one way of estimating the intrinsic value of Amgen Inc. (NASDAQ:AMGN) by taking the forecast future cash flows of the company and discounting them back to today's value. We will use the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model on this occasion. Don't get put off by the jargon, the math behind it is actually quite straightforward.We generally believe that a company's value is the present value of all of the cash it will generate in the future. However, a DCF is just one valuation metric among many, and it is not without flaws. If you still have some burning questions about this type of valuation, take a look at the Simply Wall St analysis model. Check out our latest analysis for Amgen What's The Estimated Valuation?We're using the 2-stage growth model, which simply means we take in account two stages of company's growth. In the initial period the company may have a higher growth rate and the second stage is usually assumed to have a stable growth rate. To begin with, we have to get estimates of the next ten years of cash flows. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.Generally we assume that a dollar today is more valuable than a dollar in the future, and so the sum of these future cash flows is then discounted to today's value:10-year free cash flow (FCF) forecast2023202420252026202720282029203020312032 Levered FCF ($, Millions) US$9.94bUS$10.7bUS$9.17bUS$10.9bUS$11.5bUS$11.9bUS$12.2bUS$12.5bUS$12.9bUS$13.2bGrowth Rate Estimate SourceAnalyst x3Analyst x4Analyst x4Analyst x2Analyst x2Est @ 3.28%Est @ 2.91%Est @ 2.66%Est @ 2.48%Est @ 2.36% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 7.5% US$9.2kUS$9.3kUS$7.4kUS$8.1kUS$8.0kUS$7.7kUS$7.4kUS$7.0kUS$6.7kUS$6.4k(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$77bStory continuesWe now need to calculate the Terminal Value, which accounts for all the future cash flows after this ten year period. The Gordon Growth formula is used to calculate Terminal Value at a future annual growth rate equal to the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield of 2.1%. We discount the terminal cash flows to today's value at a cost of equity of 7.5%.Terminal Value (TV)= FCF2032 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$13b× (1 + 2.1%) ÷ (7.5%– 2.1%) = US$249bPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$249b÷ ( 1 + 7.5%)10= US$121bThe total value, or equity value, is then the sum of the present value of the future cash flows, which in this case is US$198b. In the final step we divide the equity value by the number of shares outstanding. Relative to the current share price of US$234, the company appears quite good value at a 37% discount to where the stock price trades currently. The assumptions in any calculation have a big impact on the valuation, so it is better to view this as a rough estimate, not precise down to the last cent.dcfThe AssumptionsThe calculation above is very dependent on two assumptions. The first is the discount rate and the other is the cash flows. If you don't agree with these result, have a go at the calculation yourself and play with the assumptions. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Amgen as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 7.5%, which is based on a levered beta of 0.910. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.SWOT Analysis for AmgenStrengthEarnings growth over the past year exceeded the industry.Debt is well covered by earnings and cashflows.Dividends are covered by earnings and cash flows.WeaknessDividend is low compared to the top 25% of dividend payers in the Biotechs market.OpportunityAnnual earnings are forecast to grow for the next 3 years.Good value based on P/E ratio and estimated fair value.ThreatAnnual earnings are forecast to grow slower than the American market.Next Steps:Although the valuation of a company is important, it shouldn't be the only metric you look at when researching a company. DCF models are not the be-all and end-all of investment valuation. Preferably you'd apply different cases and assumptions and see how they would impact the company's valuation. If a company grows at a different rate, or if its cost of equity or risk free rate changes sharply, the output can look very different. Can we work out why the company is trading at a discount to intrinsic value?

Prices fell particularly hard on Friday after data showed that the Personal Consumption Expenditures index- the Fed’s preferred inflation gauge- remained elevated through January, giving the central bank more impetus to keep hiking rates.Broader metal markets were also nursing steep losses from the prior week, given that rising interest rates and a strong dollar take the sheen off non-yielding assets.Spot gold was flat at $1,811.37 an ounce, while gold futures hovered around $1,818.00 an ounce by 19:08 ET (00:08 GMT). Both instruments were at their lowest level since late-December. Spot gold was also close to sinking below the key $1,800 support level, a breach of which could spell more near-term losses.The dollar hovered around a seven-week high against a basket of currencies, while 10-year Treasury yields were now eyeing a move past the 4% level- and were at their highest point since early-November.Stickier-than-expected U.S. inflation saw metal markets reverse most of a new-year rally, as traders feared a bigger opportunity cost in holding non-yielding assets. Metal prices had weakened through most of 2022 on this notion, as the Fed began hiking rates aggressively.Other precious metals were mixed on Monday. Platinum futures rose 0.5% to $912.65 an ounce, while silver futures fell 0.2% to $20.895 an ounce.Among industrial metals, copper prices rose slightly after plummeting past key levels last week. Concerns over an ensuing economic slowdown caused by tighter monetary policy largely offset bets on a recovery in Chinese copper demand this year.Copper futures rose 0.4% to $3.9725, recovering from their weakest level since early-January. But the red metal was once again trading below the key $4 level.Story continuesMixed economic readings from China, the world’s largest copper importer, saw markets trim their bets on an immediate economic recovery in the country, even as it relaxed most anti-COVID restrictions earlier this year.Related ArticlesGold prices hover around 2-month low amid rate hike jittersAustralian exporters rekindle China ties amid diplomatic thawOil little changed as Russian supply cuts support prices]"

55,f5c807f6-612b-3505-a0d8-4922a19636f3,M,2023-02-27,Energy & precious metals - weekly review and outlook,Investing.com,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/energy-precious-metals-weekly-review-063610314.html,1677393370,STORY,['M'],"[By Barani KrishnanInvesting.com -- While the S&amp;P 500 had its worst week of this year from some of the Fed’s harshest inflation rhetoric in months, oil still found a way to finish in neutral as longs dived deep to buy into a market that scraped three-week lows just two days earlier.At the heart of the recovery was the unwavering faith of oil bulls that Chinese demand will return bigger than ever to the market with the largest crude importer having ditched all COVID controls. With the anniversary of the Ukraine invasion dawning upon us, many admirers of Vladimir Putin were also cheering him on in oil trading forums to make life harder for energy-consuming countries with even deeper Russian production cuts than those speculated in a Reuters story this week.One would imagine that the long side of the crude trade would be happy with the week’s outcome given what the alternative could have been - the dollar was at a seven-week peak and two-year Treasuries hit their highest since 2007.Yet, after-hours bar talk on Friday, at least the one I was privy to with several hedge fund people, suggested a growing suspicion among longs that the EIA, or Energy Information Administration, was out to screw them by deliberately overestimating crude stockpiles week after week.At stake was a build of roughly 60 million barrels in crude reported by the EIA since the start of the year, along with the caveat of so-called adjustments stated in each weekly report to reflect what the agency figured had gone missing to correctly reflect balances after all forms of supply and demand.This latest Weekly Petroleum Status Report particularly kicked up a storm after the EIA stated in line 13 an adjustment of 2.097 million barrels per day that if calculated over seven working days would amount to 14.511 million barrels. The prior week, it was 13.8 million barrels.Phil Flynn, an analyst at Chicago’s Price Futures Group and a self-proclaimed oil bull, took up the argument in his Friday note, saying “these adjustments are way out of whack with historical norms”.Story continuesTo make his point, Flynn used the EIA’s own reference that typically an adjustment was supposed to be less than 2% of refinery crude oil inputs. The inputs for the week ended Feb. 17 were at 15 million barrels, meaning a 2% adjustment should have been around 300,000 barrels at most. The 14.511 million barrels the EIA reported as an adjustment was closer to a 14.5% adjustment, Flynn argued.He signed off with a further lament that, regardless of the fact of the matter, “the EIA tells us that based off that adjustment, U.S. commercial crude oil inventories are about 9% above the five-year average for this time of year.”What perhaps was missed by many was the tweet by EIA Administrator Joe DeCarolis on Friday that addressed the controversy. In fact, DeCarolis had issued a similar tweet in November, just as discrepancies between supply and demand had prompted the EIA to make larger weekly adjustments.In his latest tweet, DeCarolis said: “We've had two weeks in a row with large crude oil adjustments indicating undersupply: 2 million bbl/d both weeks.” He added: “Remember: weekly numbers are highly variable; better to focus on the WPSR 4-week average or PSM. We'll be releasing the findings of our 90-day study very soon.”And what does the 4-week average for the latest full month - January - say?In the Monthly Energy Review, under “stocks”, the EIA has a “preliminary” estimate of 1.61M barrels - virtually matching the 1.6072M reported for the week ended Jan. 27.In a foreword to the numbers, the EIA says: “These data are usually preliminary (and sometimes estimated or forecasted) and likely to be revised the following month.”The variance resulting from adjustments, after all supply and demand are accounted for, is usually negligible.Aside from the foreword of the energy review, the EIA does alert readers in the footnotes of the actual data itself that the numbers may not add up right away, though they do eventually. “Stocks are at end of period. Totals may not equal sum of components due to independent rounding.”The crude oil adjustment is perhaps the most frequently misunderstood component of the EIA’s work.Key weekly crude oil quantities are linked through the following balance relationship: Domestic Production + Imports = Refinery Inputs + Exports + Stock Change.The stock change - the takeaway for traders in each week’s data that can decide millions of dollars in position wins or losses - is basically the difference between total stock builds and stock draws.There is actually nothing really mysterious about the weekly adjustments made by the EIA as all the information is easily searchable online, with the agency even having published a blog or two over the years to help people better understand these.Also, in comments carried by MarketWatch this week, the EIA’s DeCarolis said in a direct response to the controversy:“Ideally, the adjustment would be zero since the crude oil supplied has to go somewhere, but there is a degree of uncertainty associated with each term, stemming from imprecise statistical sampling and modeling inaccuracies.""My question for the naysayers of the government data is: How different has the weekly supply-demand reporting by the API, or the American Petroleum Institute, been?The API, as traders know, works on numbers reported voluntarily by members of the industry. As such, the information it issues the night prior to an EIA release can never be as comprehensive. Yet, as a custodian of the industry, one would, in theory, imagine the API to be “fairer” to those seeking higher prices. And what did the API report for last week? 10M barrels versus the 7.7M reported by the EIA.I can understand the consternation of oil bulls if the API had reported a 10M draw for last week versus the 7.7M build cited by the EIA. But no, what the industry group had was 10M back-to-back for two weeks. Added up, that’s 20M versus the two-week tally of around 24M on the government’s side. There is a variance - one that will be worked out when all the data is in - but it’s not miles apart as oil bulls think or contend.John Kilduff, founding partner at New York energy hedge fund Again Capital, has this to say for those who still feel done over by the EIA’s adjustments:“These variances have hurt those on the short side of oil too. The difference though is you don’t hear them complaining about it, at least not as much as the longs do. At the end of the day, these numbers are real and they are what the whole world refers to as U.S. oil data. If you still feel otherwise, remember: You can’t fight City Hall.”Oil: Market Settlements and Activity New York-traded West Texas Intermediate, or WTI, crude for April delivery did a final trade of $76.45 on Friday, after settling the official session at $76.32 per barrel - up 93 cents, or 1.2%, on the day.Earlier in the session, WTI fell as much as $1.28. But after the turnaround, the U.S. crude benchmark finished the week down just 2 cents, practically flat.Brent for April delivery did a final trade of $83.23 on Friday, after settling the official session at $83.16 per barrel - up 96 cents, or 1.2%, on the day.Brent fell as much as $1.12 earlier in the session. For the week, the global crude benchmark finished up 13 cents, or nearly flat too.Oil: Price OutlookWTI is at an inflection point after a narrow $4-trading range through the week with just two days of loss aversion at the end, said Sunil Kumar Dixit, chief technical strategist at SKCharting.com.“The upside remains capped at $78 initially, above which the weekly Middle Bollinger Band of $80.15 looks like the next challenge,” said Dixit. “Strong acceptance above $80.20 will be seen as an endorsement for the major resistance zone at the 100-week SMA (Simple Moving Average) of $83.90 and the 50-week EMA (Exponential Moving Average) of $84.70.”Failure to make a sustainable break above $80.20 will cause fresh weakness, prompting a quick drop to the recent low of under $74, he said. “WTI looks vulnerable to the ascending trend line support at $72.20,” Dixit added.Natural gas: Market Settlements and Activity The most-active April gas contract on the New York Mercantile Exchange’s Henry Hub did a final trade of $2.726 per mmBtu, or metric million British thermal units, on Friday. It earlier settled the official session at $2.4510 — up 1.9 cents, or 0.8%. That gain was in addition to the previous day’s 5.8% rise that added a little more insulation for the contract from a retest of the $2 support that would open the trapdoor for its plunge again into $1 territory.For the week, Henry Hub’s most-active gas contract rose 4.3%, marking only the second positive week in 10 for futures of the heating oil. March, the front-month contract on the hub, expired at Friday’s close, settling at $2. March gas fell to a 2-½-year low of $1.967 on Thursday.The higher close of the past two sessions came after the Energy Information Administration reported that U.S. utilities pulled 71 bcf, or billion cubic feet, from U.S. natural gas storage during the week ended Feb. 17 for power generation and heating. That draw was just slightly above the 67-bcf consumption expected by industry analysts for last week. It also paled when compared to the 100-bcf usage from the prior week to Feb. 10. Yet, it seemed enough for now to keep gas anchored at mid-$2 levels.Natural gas: Price OutlookNatural gas’s price action over the past week indicates consolidation above the $2 support and the possibility of some bounce towards $2.78 “on a conservative perspective”, said Dixit of SKCharting.“On an immediate basis, the 4-hour chart, the RSI (Relative Strength Index) at 71 and the Stochastics at 99/95 all are giving signs of exhaustion at the lower end,” he said.“For the short term, $2.33 is the support. If this is broken, it can push prices down towards $2.15.”Resistance shifts to $2.68-$2.78 may be tested if the price action is supported by demand above the daily Middle Bollinger Band of $2.48, Dixit said.“If the short-term rebound proves real above $2.78, we may be looking for the next leg higher of $3.5, which would really require strong energy among gas bulls.”Gold: Market Settlements and Activity ​​Gold for April delivery on New York’s Comex did a final trade of $1,818 an ounce after officially settling Friday’s trading at $1,817.10, down $9.70, or 0.5%.For the week, the benchmark gold futures contract lost $23.30, or 1.3%.The spot price of gold, more closely followed than futures by some traders, settled at $1,811.60, down $10.71, or 0.6% on the day.At the heart of the gold trade is the sinking feeling that the metal might be consumed by the same inflation it is supposed to be a hedge against, as the Federal Reserve gears to ratchet up rate hikes again amid stickier-than-thought price growth.The latest trouble to gold came in the form of the Fed’s preferred inflation indicator - the Personal Consumption Expenditures, or PCE, Index - which grew 5.4% in the year to January, beating forecasts for the month as well as its previous growth in December.The dollar hit a seven-week high against a basket of major currencies while the yields on the 2-year U.S. note hit their highest since 2007 amid a near reach of the 4% level for the benchmark 10-Year note.All these were on the back of expectations that the Fed will resort to more hawkish monetary action amid the “hotter inflation in the U.S.”, economist Greg Michalowski said in a post on the ForexLive forum.U.S. consumer sentiment, meanwhile, hit a 13-month high in February, according to a survey by the University of Michigan that showed Americans more optimistic about spending at a time the Fed actually needs them to show restraint.Gold: Price Outlook With the dollar back on a ramp-up, the spot price of gold looks set to advance on declines, said SKCharting’s Dixit.“Going further, the 100-week SMA of $1,808.80 which stopped the decline of gold may be challenged further by gold bears trying to dig in a bit deeper into the 50-week EMA of $1,803, followed by the weekly Middle Bollinger Band of $1,796 and the 100 Day SMA of $1,792.”Dixit said if selling intensifies below $1,800, gold is likely to witness a breaking through below the $1,796-$1,792 support areas and reach the $1,788 critical support.It could even test the 200-Day SMA of $1,775 before resuming an uptrend, he said.“As gold’s daily RSI has already reached 31, any further sell off below $1,800 or a drop to $1,788-$1,775 will push the daily RSI to extreme oversold conditions, calling for an imminent rebound to retest the broken-support-turned-resistance zone of $1,828.”Disclaimer: Barani Krishnan does not hold positions in the commodities and securities he writes about.Related ArticlesOil flat on week as U.S. inventories rise but Russia cuts supplyAnalysis: Decree adds to doubts about Mexican lithium industry's future]"

Some share price movements can give investors a better opportunity to enter into the stock, and potentially buy at a lower price. A question to answer is whether General Dynamics' current trading price of US$232 reflective of the actual value of the large-cap? Or is it currently undervalued, providing us with the opportunity to buy? Let’s take a look at General Dynamics’s outlook and value based on the most recent financial data to see if there are any catalysts for a price change. See our latest analysis for General Dynamics What Is General Dynamics Worth?Good news, investors! General Dynamics is still a bargain right now. According to my valuation, the intrinsic value for the stock is $312.28, which is above what the market is valuing the company at the moment. This indicates a potential opportunity to buy low. Another thing to keep in mind is that General Dynamics’s share price may be quite stable relative to the rest of the market, as indicated by its low beta. This means that if you believe the current share price should move towards its intrinsic value over time, a low beta could suggest it is not likely to reach that level anytime soon, and once it’s there, it may be hard to fall back down into an attractive buying range again.What kind of growth will General Dynamics generate?earnings-and-revenue-growthInvestors looking for growth in their portfolio may want to consider the prospects of a company before buying its shares. Although value investors would argue that it’s the intrinsic value relative to the price that matter the most, a more compelling investment thesis would be high growth potential at a cheap price. With profit expected to grow by 25% over the next couple of years, the future seems bright for General Dynamics. It looks like higher cash flow is on the cards for the stock, which should feed into a higher share valuation.Story continuesWhat This Means For YouAre you a shareholder? Since GD is currently undervalued, it may be a great time to accumulate more of your holdings in the stock. With an optimistic outlook on the horizon, it seems like this growth has not yet been fully factored into the share price. However, there are also other factors such as capital structure to consider, which could explain the current undervaluation.Are you a potential investor? If you’ve been keeping an eye on GD for a while, now might be the time to enter the stock. Its prosperous future outlook isn’t fully reflected in the current share price yet, which means it’s not too late to buy GD. But before you make any investment decisions, consider other factors such as the strength of its balance sheet, in order to make a well-informed buy.If you'd like to know more about General Dynamics as a business, it's important to be aware of any risks it's facing.

If these facilities become unavailable, NEP's projects and pipelines may not be able to operate or deliver energy or may become partially or fully unavailable to transport natural gas; NEP's business is subject to liabilities and operating restrictions arising from environmental, health and safety laws and regulations, compliance with which may require significant capital expenditures, increase NEP's cost of operations and affect or limit its business plans; NEP's renewable energy projects or pipelines may be adversely affected by legislative changes or a failure to comply with applicable energy and pipeline regulations; Petroleos Mexicanos (Pemex) may claim certain immunities under the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act and Mexican law, and the subsidiaries' of NEP that directly own the natural gas pipeline assets located in Texas ability to sue or recover from Pemex for breach of contract may be limited and may be exacerbated if there is a deterioration in the economic relationship between the U.S. and Mexico; NEP does not own all of the land on which the projects in its portfolio are located and its use and enjoyment of the property may be adversely affected to the extent that there are any lienholders or land rights holders that have rights that are superior to NEP's rights or the U.S. Bureau of Land Management suspends its federal rights-of-way grants; NEP is subject to risks associated with litigation or administrative proceedings that could materially impact its operations, including, but not limited to, proceedings related to projects it acquires in the future; NEP's operations require NEP to comply with anti-corruption laws and regulations of the U.S. government and Mexico; NEP is subject to risks associated with its ownership interests in projects that are under construction, which could result in its inability to complete construction projects on time or at all, and make projects too expensive to complete or cause the return on an investment to be less than expected; NEP relies on a limited number of customers and is exposed to the risk that they may be unwilling or unable to fulfill their contractual obligations to NEP or that they otherwise terminate their agreements with NEP; NEP may not be able to extend, renew or replace expiring or terminated power purchase agreements (PPA), natural gas transportation agreements or other customer contracts at favorable rates or on a long-term basis; If the energy production by or availability of NEP's renewable energy projects is less than expected, they may not be able to satisfy minimum production or availability obligations under their PPAs; NEP's growth strategy depends on locating and acquiring interests in additional projects consistent with its business strategy at favorable prices; Reductions in demand for natural gas in the U.S. or Mexico and low market prices of natural gas could materially adversely affect NEP's pipeline operations and cash flows; Government laws, regulations and policies providing incentives and subsidies for clean energy could be changed, reduced or eliminated at any time and such changes may negatively impact NEP's growth strategy; NEP's growth strategy depends on the acquisition of projects developed by NextEra Energy, Inc. (NEE) and third parties, which face risks related to project siting, financing, construction, permitting, the environment, governmental approvals and the negotiation of project development agreements; Acquisitions of existing clean energy projects involve numerous risks; NEP may continue to acquire other sources of clean energy and may expand to include other types of assets. Any further acquisition of non-renewable energy projects may present unforeseen challenges and result in a competitive disadvantage relative to NEP's more-established competitors; NEP faces substantial competition primarily from regulated utility holding companies, developers, independent power producers, pension funds and private equity funds for opportunities in North America; The natural gas pipeline industry is highly competitive, and increased competitive pressure could adversely affect NEP's business; NEP may not be able to access sources of capital on commercially reasonable terms, which would have a material adverse effect on its ability to consummate future acquisitions and pursue other growth opportunities; Restrictions in NEP and its subsidiaries' financing agreements could adversely affect NEP's business, financial condition, results of operations and ability to make cash distributions to its unitholders; NEP's cash distributions to its unitholders may be reduced as a result of restrictions on NEP's subsidiaries' cash distributions to NEP under the terms of their indebtedness or other financing agreements; NEP's subsidiaries' substantial amount of indebtedness may adversely affect NEP's ability to operate its business, and its failure to comply with the terms of its subsidiaries' indebtedness could have a material adverse effect on NEP's financial condition; NEP is exposed to risks inherent in its use of interest rate swaps; Widespread public health crises and epidemics or pandemics may have material adverse impacts on NEP's business, financial condition, liquidity, results of operations and ability to make cash distributions to its unitholders; NEE has influence over NEP; Under the cash sweep and credit support agreement, NEP receives credit support from NEE and its affiliates.

NEP's financial condition and ability to make distributions to its unitholders, as well as its ability to grow distributions in the future, is highly dependent on NEER's performance of its obligations to return all or a portion of these funds; NEER's right of first refusal may adversely affect NEP's ability to consummate future sales or to obtain favorable sale terms; NextEra Energy Partners GP, Inc.

Tracking buying activity from January – December 2022, the industry faced many obstacles as fewer customers returned to market and loyalty fell for the third year in a row.(PRNewsfoto/S&amp;P Global)""The past three years have been a challenge for the automotive industry,"" said Joe LaFeir, President, Automotive Insights, S&amp;P Global Mobility. ""As customers are returning back to market post pandemic and inventory levels have slowly improved from last year's lows, retaining loyal customers has been more challenging than ever before.""Industry-wide inventory shortages prompted many consumers to shop other brands if their previously chosen brand did not have sufficient stock. From pre-pandemic 2019, overall industry average loyalty has decreased from 54.6% to 50.2% in 2022.Calendar year 2022 marks the eighth consecutive win for GM in the 'Overall Loyalty to Manufacturer' category, and 19th win in the last 27 years. Consistent demand for GM's sport-utility and pickup offerings, in addition to rising Inventory levels, led to strong loyalty gains for the manufacturer throughout 2022.On top of its 'Overall Loyalty to Make' recognition, Tesla scored repeat wins for 'Highest Conquest Percentage' and ""Alternative Powertrain Loyalty to Make.' The combination of an active return-to-market consumer base and majority share of BEV sales were contributors to Tesla's loyalty performance this year. However, the brand's resonance with ethnic consumers was a key driver in its recognition for loyalty improvement and diversity retention. Ethnic consumers represented 40% of all personal vehicle registrations for 2022, an increase of two percentage points from the previous year. For more than 15 years, Ethnic customer retention has been part of the loyalty awards program in various forms. For 2022, S&amp;P Global Mobility has combined the diverse consumer base under one category, 'Ethnic Market Loyalty to Make,' to reflect the combined growth in the ethnic market over the last several years. Tesla was the winner of this year's award as 52% of its loyal volume came from ethnic consumers.Story continues""Ethnic buyers have increased their market share in the industry every year for the last decade, making them an important audience in building loyalty success for the foreseeable future,"" said Vince Palomarez, product manager, Loyalty, at S&amp;P Global Mobility.Mercedes-Benz, with the successful launch of the EQS, was recognized this year as the winner for 'Most Improved Alternative Powertrain Loyalty to Make' award, recognizing a brand's improvement in its ability to retain an owner to both the brand and either a BEV or hybrid powertrain.Subaru scored its first win in the 'Overall Loyalty to Dealer' category as 38 percent of Subaru owners returning to market acquired their next vehicle from the same dealer.A complete list of 2022 award winners follows:MANUFACTURER AND MAKE LOYALTY AWARDSWINNEROverall Loyalty to ManufacturerGeneral Motors*Overall Loyalty to MakeTeslaEthnic Market Loyalty to MakeTeslaMost Improved Make LoyaltyTeslaOverall Loyalty to DealerSubaruHighest Conquest PercentageTesla*Alternative Powertrain Loyalty to MakeTesla*Most Improved Alternative Powertrain Loyalty to MakeMercedes-BenzSEGMENT MODEL LOYALTY AWARDSWINNERSmall UtilityChevrolet EquinoxMid-Size UtilitySubaru OutbackFull-Size UtilityChevrolet TahoeMid-Size PickupHonda Ridgeline*Light-Duty PickupFord F-SeriesHeavy-Duty PickupChevrolet Silverado 2500/3500VanMercedes-Benz SprinterSports CarDodge Challenger*Small CarChevrolet Bolt*Large CarNissan AltimaLuxury Small UtilityTesla Model YLuxury Mid-Size UtilityLincoln NautilusLuxury Full-Size UtilityLand Rover Range RoverLuxury Sports CarChevrolet Corvette*Luxury Small CarTesla Model 3Luxury Mid-Size Car Lexus ES*Luxury Full-Size Car Mercedes-Benz S-Class*Note: *repeat winner from the 2021 awards.Loyalty Awards MethodologyThis year's awards are based on a fact-based analysis of 11.7 million new retail vehicle registrations in the U.S. during the 2022 calendar year.

Prices fell particularly hard on Friday after data showed that the Personal Consumption Expenditures index- the Fed’s preferred inflation gauge- remained elevated through January, giving the central bank more impetus to keep hiking rates.Broader metal markets were also nursing steep losses from the prior week, given that rising interest rates and a strong dollar take the sheen off non-yielding assets.Spot gold was flat at $1,811.37 an ounce, while gold futures hovered around $1,818.00 an ounce by 19:08 ET (00:08 GMT). Both instruments were at their lowest level since late-December. Spot gold was also close to sinking below the key $1,800 support level, a breach of which could spell more near-term losses.The dollar hovered around a seven-week high against a basket of currencies, while 10-year Treasury yields were now eyeing a move past the 4% level- and were at their highest point since early-November.Stickier-than-expected U.S. inflation saw metal markets reverse most of a new-year rally, as traders feared a bigger opportunity cost in holding non-yielding assets. Metal prices had weakened through most of 2022 on this notion, as the Fed began hiking rates aggressively.Other precious metals were mixed on Monday. Platinum futures rose 0.5% to $912.65 an ounce, while silver futures fell 0.2% to $20.895 an ounce.Among industrial metals, copper prices rose slightly after plummeting past key levels last week. Concerns over an ensuing economic slowdown caused by tighter monetary policy largely offset bets on a recovery in Chinese copper demand this year.Copper futures rose 0.4% to $3.9725, recovering from their weakest level since early-January. But the red metal was once again trading below the key $4 level.Story continuesMixed economic readings from China, the world’s largest copper importer, saw markets trim their bets on an immediate economic recovery in the country, even as it relaxed most anti-COVID restrictions earlier this year.Related ArticlesGold prices hover around 2-month low amid rate hike jittersAustralian exporters rekindle China ties amid diplomatic thawOil little changed as Russian supply cuts support prices]"

68,f5c807f6-612b-3505-a0d8-4922a19636f3,MA,2023-02-27,Energy & precious metals - weekly review and outlook,Investing.com,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/energy-precious-metals-weekly-review-063610314.html,1677393370,STORY,"['GC=F', 'CL=F', 'HO=F']","[By Barani KrishnanInvesting.com -- While the S&amp;P 500 had its worst week of this year from some of the Fed’s harshest inflation rhetoric in months, oil still found a way to finish in neutral as longs dived deep to buy into a market that scraped three-week lows just two days earlier.At the heart of the recovery was the unwavering faith of oil bulls that Chinese demand will return bigger than ever to the market with the largest crude importer having ditched all COVID controls. With the anniversary of the Ukraine invasion dawning upon us, many admirers of Vladimir Putin were also cheering him on in oil trading forums to make life harder for energy-consuming countries with even deeper Russian production cuts than those speculated in a Reuters story this week.One would imagine that the long side of the crude trade would be happy with the week’s outcome given what the alternative could have been - the dollar was at a seven-week peak and two-year Treasuries hit their highest since 2007.Yet, after-hours bar talk on Friday, at least the one I was privy to with several hedge fund people, suggested a growing suspicion among longs that the EIA, or Energy Information Administration, was out to screw them by deliberately overestimating crude stockpiles week after week.At stake was a build of roughly 60 million barrels in crude reported by the EIA since the start of the year, along with the caveat of so-called adjustments stated in each weekly report to reflect what the agency figured had gone missing to correctly reflect balances after all forms of supply and demand.This latest Weekly Petroleum Status Report particularly kicked up a storm after the EIA stated in line 13 an adjustment of 2.097 million barrels per day that if calculated over seven working days would amount to 14.511 million barrels. The prior week, it was 13.8 million barrels.Phil Flynn, an analyst at Chicago’s Price Futures Group and a self-proclaimed oil bull, took up the argument in his Friday note, saying “these adjustments are way out of whack with historical norms”.Story continuesTo make his point, Flynn used the EIA’s own reference that typically an adjustment was supposed to be less than 2% of refinery crude oil inputs. The inputs for the week ended Feb. 17 were at 15 million barrels, meaning a 2% adjustment should have been around 300,000 barrels at most. The 14.511 million barrels the EIA reported as an adjustment was closer to a 14.5% adjustment, Flynn argued.He signed off with a further lament that, regardless of the fact of the matter, “the EIA tells us that based off that adjustment, U.S. commercial crude oil inventories are about 9% above the five-year average for this time of year.”What perhaps was missed by many was the tweet by EIA Administrator Joe DeCarolis on Friday that addressed the controversy. In fact, DeCarolis had issued a similar tweet in November, just as discrepancies between supply and demand had prompted the EIA to make larger weekly adjustments.In his latest tweet, DeCarolis said: “We've had two weeks in a row with large crude oil adjustments indicating undersupply: 2 million bbl/d both weeks.” He added: “Remember: weekly numbers are highly variable; better to focus on the WPSR 4-week average or PSM. We'll be releasing the findings of our 90-day study very soon.”And what does the 4-week average for the latest full month - January - say?In the Monthly Energy Review, under “stocks”, the EIA has a “preliminary” estimate of 1.61M barrels - virtually matching the 1.6072M reported for the week ended Jan. 27.In a foreword to the numbers, the EIA says: “These data are usually preliminary (and sometimes estimated or forecasted) and likely to be revised the following month.”The variance resulting from adjustments, after all supply and demand are accounted for, is usually negligible.Aside from the foreword of the energy review, the EIA does alert readers in the footnotes of the actual data itself that the numbers may not add up right away, though they do eventually. “Stocks are at end of period. Totals may not equal sum of components due to independent rounding.”The crude oil adjustment is perhaps the most frequently misunderstood component of the EIA’s work.Key weekly crude oil quantities are linked through the following balance relationship: Domestic Production + Imports = Refinery Inputs + Exports + Stock Change.The stock change - the takeaway for traders in each week’s data that can decide millions of dollars in position wins or losses - is basically the difference between total stock builds and stock draws.There is actually nothing really mysterious about the weekly adjustments made by the EIA as all the information is easily searchable online, with the agency even having published a blog or two over the years to help people better understand these.Also, in comments carried by MarketWatch this week, the EIA’s DeCarolis said in a direct response to the controversy:“Ideally, the adjustment would be zero since the crude oil supplied has to go somewhere, but there is a degree of uncertainty associated with each term, stemming from imprecise statistical sampling and modeling inaccuracies.""My question for the naysayers of the government data is: How different has the weekly supply-demand reporting by the API, or the American Petroleum Institute, been?The API, as traders know, works on numbers reported voluntarily by members of the industry. As such, the information it issues the night prior to an EIA release can never be as comprehensive. Yet, as a custodian of the industry, one would, in theory, imagine the API to be “fairer” to those seeking higher prices. And what did the API report for last week? 10M barrels versus the 7.7M reported by the EIA.I can understand the consternation of oil bulls if the API had reported a 10M draw for last week versus the 7.7M build cited by the EIA. But no, what the industry group had was 10M back-to-back for two weeks. Added up, that’s 20M versus the two-week tally of around 24M on the government’s side. There is a variance - one that will be worked out when all the data is in - but it’s not miles apart as oil bulls think or contend.John Kilduff, founding partner at New York energy hedge fund Again Capital, has this to say for those who still feel done over by the EIA’s adjustments:“These variances have hurt those on the short side of oil too. The difference though is you don’t hear them complaining about it, at least not as much as the longs do. At the end of the day, these numbers are real and they are what the whole world refers to as U.S. oil data. If you still feel otherwise, remember: You can’t fight City Hall.”Oil: Market Settlements and Activity New York-traded West Texas Intermediate, or WTI, crude for April delivery did a final trade of $76.45 on Friday, after settling the official session at $76.32 per barrel - up 93 cents, or 1.2%, on the day.Earlier in the session, WTI fell as much as $1.28. But after the turnaround, the U.S. crude benchmark finished the week down just 2 cents, practically flat.Brent for April delivery did a final trade of $83.23 on Friday, after settling the official session at $83.16 per barrel - up 96 cents, or 1.2%, on the day.Brent fell as much as $1.12 earlier in the session. For the week, the global crude benchmark finished up 13 cents, or nearly flat too.Oil: Price OutlookWTI is at an inflection point after a narrow $4-trading range through the week with just two days of loss aversion at the end, said Sunil Kumar Dixit, chief technical strategist at SKCharting.com.“The upside remains capped at $78 initially, above which the weekly Middle Bollinger Band of $80.15 looks like the next challenge,” said Dixit. “Strong acceptance above $80.20 will be seen as an endorsement for the major resistance zone at the 100-week SMA (Simple Moving Average) of $83.90 and the 50-week EMA (Exponential Moving Average) of $84.70.”Failure to make a sustainable break above $80.20 will cause fresh weakness, prompting a quick drop to the recent low of under $74, he said. “WTI looks vulnerable to the ascending trend line support at $72.20,” Dixit added.Natural gas: Market Settlements and Activity The most-active April gas contract on the New York Mercantile Exchange’s Henry Hub did a final trade of $2.726 per mmBtu, or metric million British thermal units, on Friday. It earlier settled the official session at $2.4510 — up 1.9 cents, or 0.8%. That gain was in addition to the previous day’s 5.8% rise that added a little more insulation for the contract from a retest of the $2 support that would open the trapdoor for its plunge again into $1 territory.For the week, Henry Hub’s most-active gas contract rose 4.3%, marking only the second positive week in 10 for futures of the heating oil. March, the front-month contract on the hub, expired at Friday’s close, settling at $2. March gas fell to a 2-½-year low of $1.967 on Thursday.The higher close of the past two sessions came after the Energy Information Administration reported that U.S. utilities pulled 71 bcf, or billion cubic feet, from U.S. natural gas storage during the week ended Feb. 17 for power generation and heating. That draw was just slightly above the 67-bcf consumption expected by industry analysts for last week. It also paled when compared to the 100-bcf usage from the prior week to Feb. 10. Yet, it seemed enough for now to keep gas anchored at mid-$2 levels.Natural gas: Price OutlookNatural gas’s price action over the past week indicates consolidation above the $2 support and the possibility of some bounce towards $2.78 “on a conservative perspective”, said Dixit of SKCharting.“On an immediate basis, the 4-hour chart, the RSI (Relative Strength Index) at 71 and the Stochastics at 99/95 all are giving signs of exhaustion at the lower end,” he said.“For the short term, $2.33 is the support. If this is broken, it can push prices down towards $2.15.”Resistance shifts to $2.68-$2.78 may be tested if the price action is supported by demand above the daily Middle Bollinger Band of $2.48, Dixit said.“If the short-term rebound proves real above $2.78, we may be looking for the next leg higher of $3.5, which would really require strong energy among gas bulls.”Gold: Market Settlements and Activity ​​Gold for April delivery on New York’s Comex did a final trade of $1,818 an ounce after officially settling Friday’s trading at $1,817.10, down $9.70, or 0.5%.For the week, the benchmark gold futures contract lost $23.30, or 1.3%.The spot price of gold, more closely followed than futures by some traders, settled at $1,811.60, down $10.71, or 0.6% on the day.At the heart of the gold trade is the sinking feeling that the metal might be consumed by the same inflation it is supposed to be a hedge against, as the Federal Reserve gears to ratchet up rate hikes again amid stickier-than-thought price growth.The latest trouble to gold came in the form of the Fed’s preferred inflation indicator - the Personal Consumption Expenditures, or PCE, Index - which grew 5.4% in the year to January, beating forecasts for the month as well as its previous growth in December.The dollar hit a seven-week high against a basket of major currencies while the yields on the 2-year U.S. note hit their highest since 2007 amid a near reach of the 4% level for the benchmark 10-Year note.All these were on the back of expectations that the Fed will resort to more hawkish monetary action amid the “hotter inflation in the U.S.”, economist Greg Michalowski said in a post on the ForexLive forum.U.S. consumer sentiment, meanwhile, hit a 13-month high in February, according to a survey by the University of Michigan that showed Americans more optimistic about spending at a time the Fed actually needs them to show restraint.Gold: Price Outlook With the dollar back on a ramp-up, the spot price of gold looks set to advance on declines, said SKCharting’s Dixit.“Going further, the 100-week SMA of $1,808.80 which stopped the decline of gold may be challenged further by gold bears trying to dig in a bit deeper into the 50-week EMA of $1,803, followed by the weekly Middle Bollinger Band of $1,796 and the 100 Day SMA of $1,792.”Dixit said if selling intensifies below $1,800, gold is likely to witness a breaking through below the $1,796-$1,792 support areas and reach the $1,788 critical support.It could even test the 200-Day SMA of $1,775 before resuming an uptrend, he said.“As gold’s daily RSI has already reached 31, any further sell off below $1,800 or a drop to $1,788-$1,775 will push the daily RSI to extreme oversold conditions, calling for an imminent rebound to retest the broken-support-turned-resistance zone of $1,828.”Disclaimer: Barani Krishnan does not hold positions in the commodities and securities he writes about.Related ArticlesOil flat on week as U.S. inventories rise but Russia cuts supplyAnalysis: Decree adds to doubts about Mexican lithium industry's future]"

(NYSE:PFE) is in early-stage talks to acquire biotech Seagen Inc. (NASDAQ:SGEN) in a deal that may potentially be worth more than $30 billion, according to the Wall Street Journal.In a report citing people familiar with the negotiations, the paper said there is no guarantee that the acquisition will eventually happen, adding that regulators would likely need to review and sign off on any possible transaction due to antitrust concerns.Seagen currently has a market capitalization of $30.14B and is expected to be worth a premium to that figure, the WSJ said.Pfizer rival Merck (NYSE:MRK) was in advanced talks with Seagen over an acquisition worth over $40B last year, but both sides were unable to reach a formal deal. The WSJ reported that Pfizer was also exploring a purchase at the time.U.S.-based Seagen has helped develop a cancer treatment that targets tumors with toxic agents. By buying the company, Pfizer could expand its offering of cancer medicines and counter an anticipated $17B hit from patent expirations in 2030.According to Reuters, Pfizer declined to comment and Seagen was not immediately available for comment.Related ArticlesWSJ: Pfizer in talks with Seagen over purchase worth possibly over $30 billionCiti doubles price target on Carvana following 4Q resultsFutures gain after Wall Street's worst week of 2023]"

For example, last week’s slew of economic data that confirmed inflation is still very much alive and kicking.(You can find a full review of last week’s numbers here.)As I said last week, inflation has declined for seven straight months, but the rate of decline is starting to level off, and that’s disappointing. It means inflation could remain at elevated levels for longer than we hoped.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsThis gives the Federal Reserve more reason to continue raising key interest rates to curb inflation – which is exactly what they confirmed yesterday with the latest Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting minutes.As reported by CNBC:Federal Reserve officials at their most recent meeting indicated that there are signs inflation is coming down, but not enough to counter the need for more interest rate increases…Inflation “remained well above” the Fed’s 2% target, the minutes stated. That came with labor markets that “remained very tight, contributing to continuing upward pressures on wages and prices.”The minutes confirmed that the Federal Reserve intends to continue rate hikes to fight inflation, with a 25 basis-point hike expected in March.As we’ve discussed, I don’t trust a lot of the economic data for January. January is the biggest month for seasonal adjustments, and I anticipate we’ll see big revisions to the January payroll and retail sales reports in the upcoming months.But the fact is, right now the markets are still very sensitive to every economic headline.However, there is an even more important catalyst that can impact stocks. So, in today’s Market 360, I’ll reveal what that catalyst is… and how you can capitalize on it.It All Comes Down to EarningsEarnings remain an important catalyst for the stock market…Stocks that post stunning quarterly results and guide higher are being rewarded. Even companies that missed analysts’ earnings estimates but announced spectacular results have seen their shares soar higher.Story continuesYou can look no further than my Growth Investor Buy List company Quanta Services, Inc. (NASDAQ:PWR) as an example.PWR surged more than 13% to a new 52-week high today, thanks to better-than-expected quarterly and yearly results. For the fourth quarter, the company reported adjusted earnings of $1.68 per share and revenue of $4.42 billion. That topped analysts’ estimates for fourth-quarter earnings of $1.60 per share on $4.28 billion in revenue.Full-year adjusted earnings came in at $6.34 per share and revenue was $17.07 billion, which also exceeded expectations for adjusted earnings of $6.32 per share and revenue of $16.93 billion.In addition, company management noted that the fourth-quarter and full-year results were both new records for the company.The reality is that earnings are the key to success in a narrower market environment, as institutional and individual investors alike are growing more fundamentally focused.The good news is that the fourth quarter should represent the trough for the S&amp;P 500’s earnings, even though the S&amp;P 500 is still expected to post negative earnings growth in the first two quarters of 2023.As the earnings season draws to a close, I expect the major indices will continue to oscillate more and more.But I don’t want you to worry.It’s normal for there to be a bit of volatility in the wake of a quarterly earnings season – and we’ll likely see stocks that rallied strongly post-earnings consolidate these gains in the upcoming weeks.Invest In Fundamentally Strong CompaniesIf you continue to invest in fundamentally strong companies, you will come out on top in the long run.My Growth Investor High-Growth Investments Buy List is up about 9% year-to-date, and my Elite Dividend Payers Buy List has rallied more than 4% so far this year. Compare that to the S&amp;P 500’s 4% increase and the Dow’s 0.2% decline this year (as of this writing).Much of the strength that my Buy List stocks have exhibited in the past seven weeks can be attributed to earnings.Currently, my Growth Investor stocks are characterized by 38.9% average annual sales growth and 283.8% average annual earnings growth. My Buy List is now trading at only 7.6 times median trailing earnings.Due to low price-to-earnings (P/E) ratios, strong dividend growth as well as strong sales and earnings growth, I expect that my stocks will be very resilient in the upcoming months.The fact is, my Growth Investor stocks, have achieved wave-after-wave of double-digit earnings growth. In fact, even some of the companies that missed earnings estimates still achieved double- or even triple-digit earnings growth.Tomorrow, I’m releasing the March issue of Growth Investor, where I’ll detail two new buy recommendations with stunning fundamentals.I’m confident my Growth Investor stocks are the crème de la crème, and that they should continue to emerge as market leaders. This is especially true as investors grow even more fundamentally focused in the final weeks of earnings season.Sign up now so you can access my new Growth Investor Monthly Issue – including my two new buys – the moment it’s released.

Its shares have fallen nearly 10% since July, when the deal talks with Merck were first reported. They rose 13% to $182.55 on Monday.Pfizer declined to comment on the WSJ report, while Seagen did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment.The Merck-Seagen deal reportedly failed over concerns that the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) would launch an antitrust investigation, but analysts said the Pfizer combination was not raising any red flags.""A Pfizer/Seagen combination will invite less scrutiny from the FTC due to less overlap of their products when compared to a Merck/Seagen deal,"" said Zhiqiang Shu, analyst at Berenberg Capital Market.Shu said Seagen was poised to grow in the next decade and has ""a perfect profile for a takeout target,"" which could work well for Pfizer that expects to lose $17 billion in annual sales by 2030 due to patent expirations for top drugs, and as demand for its COVID products begins to decline.Seagen, which specializes in antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs) that bind to tumor cells and then release cell-killing chemicals, made nearly $2 billion in revenue last year driven by demand for its approved therapies such as lymphoma treatment Adcetris and breast cancer drug Tukysa.""After a year of waiting for something impactful, this may be it,"" said Evan Seigerman, analyst at BMO Capital Markets, referring to the potential deal, at a time analysts have pointed to the need for larger acquisitions by Pfizer.Story continuesMerck, which bought ADC-maker Imago BioSciences for $1.35 billion in November, is unlikely to show renewed interest in Seagen, analysts said. Merck was not immediately available for comment.""I'm sure there's always a possibility that there could be other companies interested and there are other large pharma companies that do need to transact. I'm thinking more of the European pharma names,"" said Seigerman.(Reporting by Bhanvi Satija, Manas Mishra and Rahat Sandhu in Bengaluru; Editing by Nivedita Bhattacharjee, Shailesh Kuber and Shinjini Ganguli)]"

That's our hypothesis, but we need to prove that,"" Teshirogi said in an interview.Competing drugs are also under the microscope for their potential to deliver similar outcomes. According to one study by the Veterans Affairs St. Louis Health Care System, Pfizer's antiviral drug Paxlovid cuts the risk of developing many long COVID symptoms.Shionogi sold 2 million courses of Xocova, taken once daily for five days, to the Japanese government last year for 100 billion yen ($740 million).Jefferies analyst Stephen Barker estimates, however, that only about 11,000 courses of Xocova are being consumed each month in Japan.Shionogi is hoping for Xocova sales of around $1 billion to $1.5 billion this year.Teshirogi said he expects U.S. approval of the drug could also come by the winter of 2024, pending a Phase III trial funded in part by the National Institutes of Health.""I think $2 billion out of the COVID-19 market is not very difficult,"" he said, basing his estimate on Pfizer's forecast for more than $20 billion in COVID-related sales in 2023.Story continuesShionogi, a specialist drugmaker for infectious diseases like HIV and influenza, has ploughed about 80% of its research and development budget on coronavirus treatments in recent years.A recombinant protein-based COVID vaccine has been submitted for approval in Japan. The shot is being retooled for the Omicron variant and a nasally inhaled version is also in the works.But nearly all COVID inoculations in Japan have been with mRNA-type vaccines. The government has cancelled orders for tens of millions of shots developed by AstraZeneca Plc and Novavax Inc, clouding prospects for non-mRNA shots like Shionogi's.The company's heavy investment in COVID projects has led to concern among some analysts that its mainline drug pipeline is stagnating.""I have no regrets,"" Teshirogi said, adding that expectations among shareholders and the public had demanded that Shionogi devote its resources to fighting COVID.

(TSLA) has been the world’s best auto stock. General Motors Co. (GM) has not.But Prince never sang a song about a “Little Red Model X.” No one in East Los Angeles ever converted a Model 3 into a “lowrider.” Frank Sinatra didn’t drive a Tesla onto the set of Ocean’s Eleven.Corvettes, El Caminos, and Cadillacs are as “Americana” as Coca-Cola and Marilyn Monroe.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsBut that’s not all.GM is now taking aim at Tesla’s current cultural prominence.In a press release published earlier this week, GM CEO Mary Barra announced…2023 is the year The General begins its push in earnest to outdo most of its competitors in the electric vehicle field, aiming to eventually overtake Elon Musk’s Tesla.And General Motors isn’t merely talking the talk. The automaker has linked up with LG Energy Solutions to build a massive EV battery plant in Spring Hill, Tennessee. At same site, GM has also launched production on the all-electric Cadillac Lyriq.But GM isn’t alone in targeting Tesla and setting ambitious electric vehicle (EV) goals.Toyota Motor Corp. (TM), the No. 1 global automaker by several measures, is on track to start producing EVs in the U.S. as soon as 2025…Ford Motor Co. (F) is spending $11.4 billion to build four EV sites in Kentucky and Tennessee, including a site called Blue Oval City… Ford’s first all-new production plant since 1969. And Honda Motor Co. Ltd. (HMC) plans to set up a dedicated EV division – specifically to debut 30 EVs by 2030 and to increase “to a production volume of more than 2 million EVs per year by the same time,” according to TechCrunch.Without question, Tesla is the reigning monarch of EV companies.But the biggest problem with being a monarch is that someone is always trying to steal your throne…Story continuesAnd Tesla’s hold on the EV throne is anything but secure.HAPPENING RIGHT NOW: The Revenge of the HeartlandGone are the days where “Made in China” or “Made in Somewhere Else” is printed on everything we buy. It’s time to come home. Right in America’s Heartland, a revolution is brewing… and the profit opportunities to come with it could surge 1,000%… or more. Click here to learn more.The Real No. 1As every major car company on the planet designs new EV models and begins delivering them into the marketplace, Tesla’s market share will shrink, perhaps rapidly.But there’s no need to fret about Tesla’s future, when the EV sector is offering so many other ways to play the EV trend.Take one of my top stocks for 2023, for example: Volkswagen AG (VWAGY).While it’s true that Tesla’s EV sales crush Volkswagen’s by nearly 130% (with Tesla reporting 1.31 million EV sales in 2022 and Volkswagen reporting 572,100), Tesla trails far behind Volkswagen on all other relevant metrics. The differences between the two automakers are enormous.Tesla sold 1.3 million cars last year. Volkswagen sold six times more than that.Tesla spent $1 billion on research and development (R&amp;D) during the last 12 months. Volkswagen spent six times that amount.Tesla generated $81.5 billion in revenues in 2022. Volkswagen generated 3.5 times more.And yet, Volkswagen’s market value is not 3.5 times larger than Tesla. On the contrary, Tesla’s market value is seven times larger.It is true that Tesla makes far more EVs than Volkswagen. But even on this metric, Volkswagen clearly shines brightly.Now, let’s look into the future of EVs and where the next phase of this megatrend’s growth will come from.Here’s a hint: You won’t have to look far…Under the HoodLast month, right after the New Year, I traveled to where I believe will be the next epicenter of American wealth – and it’s all thanks to the EV revolution.My team and I trekked to the top of Lookout Mountain on a rather gray day, but the view was stunning and expansive.From that mountaintop, you can see seven U.S. states: Tennessee, Kentucky, Virginia, Georgia, Alabama, and both Carolinas.And in each of these states – especially in Kentucky and Tennessee – there’s a new economic “supercluster” of innovation and investment taking shape.In fact, in the 300 square miles surrounding that mountain…You’ll find no fewer than 28 different companies, each dedicated to building out the future for electric vehicles and the batteries that power them.Collectively, they’re investing billions of dollars in kickstarting a new era of American ingenuity and prosperity – something I call “Made in America, 2.0.”You can catch the full video here – and just by viewing it, I’ll give you one of my top EV picks for free.Regards,EricP.S.

90,2e475e05-2bd0-37dd-a910-440b13392c55,TGT,2023-02-27,"Walmart, Target and Macy's are part of Zacks Earnings Preview",Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/walmart-target-macys-part-zacks-093409049.html,1677490449,STORY,"['TGT', 'WMT', '^GSPC']","[For Immediate ReleaseChicago, IL – February 27, 2023 – Zacks.com releases the list of companies likely to issue earnings surprises. This week’s list includes Walmart WMT, Target TGT and Macy’s M.Breaking Down Retail Earnings &amp; Consumer Spending TrendsIt is no surprise that the combined weight of elevated inflation, rising interest rates and uncertainty about the economy have forced consumers to change their spending behavior.The issue has undoubtedly been at play with lower-income households for some time now. But we can intuitively appreciate that it will not stay restricted to this consumer segment alone and will most likely move up the income chain in the days ahead.We saw some of that in the Walmart report that showed the retailer benefiting from higher-income consumers ‘trading down’ to its stores in response to the aforementioned headwinds. On the flip side, a big contributor to Walmart’s weak guidance for this year reflects a moderating consumer spending backdrop that some in the market see as overly conservative.The retail business is a tough and competitive space even in ‘normal’ times and these are anything but normal times.They need just the right amount of inventory, otherwise they will either lose sales if they don’t have enough merchandise as was the case earlier in the pandemic or they will need to offer steeper discounts and hurt margins if they have too much of it, as we saw with Walmart and Target last year.Retailers also need to make sure that they have the right type of merchandise, as we saw with Target and Walmart having too much of the patio furniture that consumers weren’t interested in buying. Keeping stores fully staffed in a tight labor market and ensuring just right amount of price discounts are some of the other challenges that big-box operators like Walmart, Target and others face daily.Walmart’s strong performance on the inventory front over the last two quarters is a big reason why the stock has done so much better relative to Target whose results are coming out before the market’s open on Tuesday, February 28th.Story continuesTarget shares are one of those stocks that really move on quarterly releases. The stock was down following each of the last three releases, with the May 18th 2022 report was one for the record books when the stock lost more than a quarter of its value as the company’s inventory and merchandising problems took center stage. This puts a premium on Target’s release Tuesday morning given the stock’s impressive run this year.It all comes down to execution and management effectiveness.In a backdrop of moderating and shifting consumer spending behavior, some retailers have been more successful than others. Walmart has been better, Target less so, though Target shares have been stellar performers in recent weeks. Macy’s, which also reports this week, has been one of the laggards.Since the start of 2023, however, Target shares are up +10.1% vs. +4.5% for the S&amp;P 500 index, while Walmart and Macy’s shares are down -0.6% and -1%, respectively.With respect to the Retail sector’s 2022 Q4 earnings season scorecard, we now have results from 24 of the 33 retailers in the S&amp;P 500 index. Total Q4 earnings for these retailers are down -33% from the same period last year on +6.5% higher revenues, with 70.8% beating EPS estimates and 62.5% beating revenue estimates.Retailers have been struggling to come out with positive surprises thus far, with the variance relative to the historical ranges particularly notable on the EPS side.With respect to the earnings and revenue growth rates, Amazon’s -85.4% earnings decline plays a significant role in the group’s weak year-over-year growth rate for the sector (Amazon is part of the Zacks Retail sector, and not the Zacks Technology sector). Most of the Retail sector earnings reports that have come out already are in the digital part of the space, with the more traditional retailers started the reporting cycle with last week’s Walmart release and a host of others on deck this week.As we all know, the digital and brick-and-mortar operators have been converging for some time now, with Amazon now a decent sized brick-and-mortar operator after Whole Foods and Walmart a growing online vendor. This long-standing trend got a huge boost from the Covid lockdowns.This Week’s Reporting DocketWe have more than 550 companies on deck to report results this week, including 30 S&amp;P 500 members. Notable companies reporting this week, aside from the aforementioned retailers include Berkshire Hathaway, Broadcom, Salesforce.com and others.2022 Q4 Earnings Season ScorecardAs of Friday, February 24th, we now have Q4 results from 468 S&amp;P 500 members or 93.6% of the index’s total membership. Total earnings for these companies are down -5.7% from the same period last year on +6% higher revenues, with 70.7% beating EPS estimates and an equal proportion beating revenue estimates.There is a notable deceleration in the growth trajectory, both for earnings as well as revenues. Please note that this decelerating growth trend doesn’t change in any meaningful way whether we look at it on an ex-Finance or ex-Tech bases.The Earnings Big PictureWe have all along been referring to the overall picture that emerged from the 2022 Q4 reporting cycle as good enough; not great, but not bad either.The revisions trend continues to be negative, with the outlook for a number of sectors on the weak side. But it is consistent with the evolving macroeconomic picture and far from the dire scenario that many in the market feared.Please note that while Q1 estimates are coming down, the pace and magnitude of cuts is notably below what we had seen ahead of the start of the last couple of earnings seasons.Please note that the $1.911 trillion in expected aggregate earnings for the index in 2023 approximate to an index ‘EPS’ of $215.47, down from $215.89 last week and the $215.90 tally we are on track to have seen in 2022.With the bulk of the 2022 Q4 reporting cycle now behind us, revisions have mostly played down for the next few weeks though the Retail sector results will have a bearing on how expectations for that space evolve.We continue to believe that a definitive read on the revisions front will only emerge once we have seen an end to the Fed’s tightening cycle and the impact of the cumulative tightening on economic growth.That said, relative to pre-season doom-and-gloom worries, this is fairly reassuring outcome.Estimates for 2023 are now a hair below the 2022 level.

This investment brings the starting wage in every U.S. market to at least $15 an hour.Meanwhile at the end of January, U.S. retailer Walmart (WMT) announced plans to increase its average hourly pay to more than $17.50, making the range now $14 to $19 per hour.In a statement to U.S. employees, Walmart U.S. CEO and president John Furner said the increase in pay was “to ensure we have attractive pay in the markets we operate.”North Miami Beach, Florida, Walmart discount department store, checkout line, cashier with customer paying . (Photo by: Jeffrey Greenberg/Universal Images Group via Getty Images)Why raise wages now? Oliver Chen, managing director at Cowen, said the decision to increase wages was ""a no brainer"" for the companies ""in a tight labor market with low unemployment.""This boost in higher hourly wages is all part of a trend as retailers ""want less turnover,"" said Chen.In January the retail industry added 30,000 jobs, while the unemployment rate remained low, at 3.4%, far lower than the January 2021 rate of nearly 6.5%.This content is not available due to your privacy preferences.Update your settings here to see it.""The reality of retail — it's a very people-centric business with a lot of frontline workers, so the future of retail is tech-enabled but people centric ... where [brick-and-mortar] meets clicks.""Retail employees are needed to fulfill strong consumer demand despite inflation, added Jharrone Martis, director of consumer research at Refinitiv.Retail sales were up 2.3% on a monthly-basis and up 3.9% compared to last year. For retail overall, including food and beverage, sales month-over-month were up 3.0% in January 2023 to $697 billion and up 6.4% from this time last year.But what do rising wages mean for the companies' bottom lines?In the short-term, higher wages will weigh, said Martis. It's ""almost like the necessary evil,"" Martis said, as the companies see it ""as a long term investment.""Story continuesHigher wages are ""definitely gross margin pressure,"" but longer-term benefits outweigh it, Chen added.""In the short term, you have gross margin, SG&amp;A [selling, general, and administrative expenses] and expense pressure; long term, you have happier employees, and which should translate to happier customers,"" Chen said.Home Depot CEO Edward Decker had a similar message to investors in the company's earnings release, saying that the labor investment is ""enabling us to attract and retain the level of talent needed to sustain the customer experience we strive to deliver.""Martis said big companies like Walmart and Home Depot can take the hit after coming out of the pandemic in a strong position.As far as seeing if other retailers raise wages, Chen said, ""Every retailer has to be very competitive on a market by market basis.""Martis has a similar view. ""If Target and Kroger want to remain competitive, they're going to have to follow suit...Out of those two companies Target is in a much better position for this because they were also a big winner during the pandemic, so it's a company that can take the risk.""Target (TGT) announced a new starting wage range of $15 to $24 last February.For smaller retailers, it gets tricky though, she said. ""For a smaller retailer, that's when you get in trouble. That's when that might hit their margins harder.""—Brooke DiPalma is a reporter for Yahoo Finance.

The Dow endured its worst weekly performance since Sept. 2022.In the week ahead, investors will remain keyed in on the retail sector, with results from Target (TGT) in focus after rival Walmart (WMT) issued a warning on the state of U.S. consumers last week.On the economic data side, a crowded calendar of reports from the housing and manufacturing sectors — two areas of the economy which have most reflected the impact of policy tightening — is on tap along with a key measure of consumer confidence.On Friday, the Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) price index — the Fed's preferred assessment of how quickly prices are rising across the economy — showed prices rose 0.6% during the month of January and 5.4% over last year. On a ""core"" basis, which strips out volatile food and energy components, prices rose 0.6% for the month and at an annual clip of 4.7%.The week marked a turning point in sentiment around inflation expectations and the path forward for interest rates.The hotter-than-expected PCE index followed upside surprises to inflation this year from the Consumer Price Index (CPI) and producer prices, which showed the largest increases in several months to start the year.""The bear market rally that began in October from reasonable prices and low expectations has morphed into a speculative frenzy based on a Fed pause/pivot that isn't coming,"" Morgan Stanley's top strategist Mike Wilson said in a note to clients last week.Wilson's forecast sees the S&amp;P 500 bottoming out at 3,000 this year.

(NASDAQ:ISRG) Investors Paying Above The Intrinsic Value?",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/intuitive-surgical-inc-nasdaq-isrg-140015619.html,1677420015.0,STORY,['ISRG'],"[Key InsightsUsing the 2 Stage Free Cash Flow to Equity, Intuitive Surgical fair value estimate is US$172Current share price of US$231 suggests Intuitive Surgical is potentially 34% overvaluedOur fair value estimate is 59% higher than Intuitive Surgical's analyst price target of US$274Does the February share price for Intuitive Surgical, Inc. (NASDAQ:ISRG) reflect what it's really worth? Today, we will estimate the stock's intrinsic value by taking the forecast future cash flows of the company and discounting them back to today's value. This will be done using the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model. Don't get put off by the jargon, the math behind it is actually quite straightforward.We would caution that there are many ways of valuing a company and, like the DCF, each technique has advantages and disadvantages in certain scenarios. If you want to learn more about discounted cash flow, the rationale behind this calculation can be read in detail in the Simply Wall St analysis model. View our latest analysis for Intuitive Surgical The ModelWe're using the 2-stage growth model, which simply means we take in account two stages of company's growth. In the initial period the company may have a higher growth rate and the second stage is usually assumed to have a stable growth rate. To start off with, we need to estimate the next ten years of cash flows. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.Generally we assume that a dollar today is more valuable than a dollar in the future, and so the sum of these future cash flows is then discounted to today's value:Story continues10-year free cash flow (FCF) forecast2023202420252026202720282029203020312032 Levered FCF ($, Millions) US$1.86bUS$2.22bUS$2.65bUS$2.73bUS$3.13bUS$3.38bUS$3.59bUS$3.77bUS$3.92bUS$4.06bGrowth Rate Estimate SourceAnalyst x5Analyst x6Analyst x3Analyst x2Analyst x2Est @ 7.94%Est @ 6.18%Est @ 4.95%Est @ 4.08%Est @ 3.48% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 7.3% US$1.7kUS$1.9kUS$2.1kUS$2.1kUS$2.2kUS$2.2kUS$2.2kUS$2.1kUS$2.1kUS$2.0k(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$21bWe now need to calculate the Terminal Value, which accounts for all the future cash flows after this ten year period. The Gordon Growth formula is used to calculate Terminal Value at a future annual growth rate equal to the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield of 2.1%. We discount the terminal cash flows to today's value at a cost of equity of 7.3%.Terminal Value (TV)= FCF2032 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$4.1b× (1 + 2.1%) ÷ (7.3%– 2.1%) = US$80bPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$80b÷ ( 1 + 7.3%)10= US$40bThe total value, or equity value, is then the sum of the present value of the future cash flows, which in this case is US$60b. To get the intrinsic value per share, we divide this by the total number of shares outstanding. Relative to the current share price of US$231, the company appears reasonably expensive at the time of writing. The assumptions in any calculation have a big impact on the valuation, so it is better to view this as a rough estimate, not precise down to the last cent.dcfImportant AssumptionsThe calculation above is very dependent on two assumptions. The first is the discount rate and the other is the cash flows. You don't have to agree with these inputs, I recommend redoing the calculations yourself and playing with them. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Intuitive Surgical as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 7.3%, which is based on a levered beta of 0.875. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.SWOT Analysis for Intuitive SurgicalStrengthCurrently debt free.WeaknessEarnings declined over the past year.Expensive based on P/E ratio and estimated fair value.OpportunityAnnual earnings are forecast to grow faster than the American market.ThreatRevenue is forecast to grow slower than 20% per year.Looking Ahead:Whilst important, the DCF calculation ideally won't be the sole piece of analysis you scrutinize for a company. It's not possible to obtain a foolproof valuation with a DCF model. Preferably you'd apply different cases and assumptions and see how they would impact the company's valuation. For example, changes in the company's cost of equity or the risk free rate can significantly impact the valuation. What is the reason for the share price exceeding the intrinsic value?

Based on this payment, the dividend yield on the company's stock will be 3.5%, which is an attractive boost to shareholder returns. Check out our latest analysis for Navient Navient's Payment Has Solid Earnings CoverageWe like to see robust dividend yields, but that doesn't matter if the payment isn't sustainable. However, prior to this announcement, Navient's dividend was comfortably covered by both cash flow and earnings. This means that most of its earnings are being retained to grow the business.EPS is set to fall by 26.4% over the next 12 months. If the dividend continues along the path it has been on recently, we estimate the payout ratio could be 18%, which is comfortable for the company to continue in the future.historic-dividendNavient Has A Solid Track RecordEven over a long history of paying dividends, the company's distributions have been remarkably stable. The dividend has gone from an annual total of $0.50 in 2013 to the most recent total annual payment of $0.64. This works out to be a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of approximately 2.5% a year over that time. Dividends have grown relatively slowly, which is not great, but some investors may value the relative consistency of the dividend.The Dividend Looks Likely To GrowInvestors who have held shares in the company for the past few years will be happy with the dividend income they have received. Navient has impressed us by growing EPS at 36% per year over the past five years. Earnings per share is growing at a solid clip, and the payout ratio is low which we think is an ideal combination in a dividend stock as the company can quite easily raise the dividend in the future.Navient Looks Like A Great Dividend StockOverall, we think that this is a great income investment, and we think that maintaining the dividend this year may have been a conservative choice. The distributions are easily covered by earnings, and there is plenty of cash being generated as well. We should point out that the earnings are expected to fall over the next 12 months, which won't be a problem if this doesn't become a trend, but could cause some turbulence in the next year. Taking this all into consideration, this looks like it could be a good dividend opportunity.Story continuesMarket movements attest to how highly valued a consistent dividend policy is compared to one which is more unpredictable. At the same time, there are other factors our readers should be conscious of before pouring capital into a stock. Taking the debate a bit further, we've identified 2 warning signs for Navient that investors need to be conscious of moving forward.

V, Mastercard Inc. MA, Fiserv, Inc. FISV, Global Payments Inc. GPN and Equifax Inc. EFX.Industry: Financial Transaction ServicesLink: https://www.zacks.com/commentary/2058588/5-financial-transaction-stocks-to-gain-from-rising-digitizationThe Financial Transaction Services industry is expected to benefit from growing transaction volumes, stemming from improved consumer spending and rebounding cross-border travels. Increased digitization across every sphere of life provides industry players with the perfect ground to capitalize on by leveraging their advanced digital prowess.Continuous pursuit of a merger and acquisition (M&amp;A) strategy coupled with technology investments enables the players to devise a solid digital solutions suite. Companies like Visa Inc., Mastercard Inc., Fiserv, Inc., Global Payments Inc. and Equifax Inc. are well-placed to gain from the growth prospects of the industry.About the IndustryThe Zacks Financial Transaction Services industry is part of the Financial Technology or the FinTech space, which includes companies with varying natures of businesses. The industry comprises card and payment processing and other solutions providers, ATM services and money remittance service providers, and providers of investment solutions to financial advisors.The players in this segment operate their unique and proprietary global payments network that links issuers and acquirers around the globe to facilitate the switching of transactions, permitting account holders to use their products at millions of acceptance locations. Monetary transactions are executed through these networks, offering a convenient, quick and secure payment method in several currencies across the globe. The industry is benefiting from the ongoing digitization movement, triggered by the pandemic.4 Trends Defining Future of the Financial Transaction Services IndustryWidespread Uptake of Contactless Payments: One of the most prominent trends noticed since the coronavirus outbreak is people’s inclination toward adopting digital means across every sphere of life. With the cost-effective nature and ease of digital payments, there is no sign of the digital trend fading away anytime soon. Several flexible digital payment options, ranging from buy now, pay later (BNPL) solutions, cryptocurrency, biometrics, to QR code utilization, which consumers were earlier skeptical of, have started gaining popularity.Story continuesAs a result, the financial transaction services industry players have been actively undertaking significant investments for building an upgraded suite and subsequently, attracting new clients as well as retaining the existing ones. Though the investments might result in escalating costs for the industry participants, digital prowess continues to fetch regular revenues and drives their margins in the long term.Better Consumer Spending: Substantial personal savings made during the pandemic enable continued consumer spending despite looming fears of inflation and recession. Strong wage gains resulting from a tight labor market have positively influenced the purchasing power of consumers. The affinity of people to spend more implies increased utilization of product and service offerings of financial transaction service players.This, in turn, boosts transaction volumes that contribute significantly to the revenues of industry participants. According to the 2023 Annual U.S. Economic Outlook issued by one of the digital payments leaders, Visa, consumer spending in the first half of 2023 is expected to remain higher than the 2022 figure and gradually pick up in the latter part of the year.Improved Cross-Border Travel: The receding impact of the pandemic led to the easing of border restrictions and renewed confidence in travel. These factors have led to a recovery in international travel, thus driving cross-border volumes of companies in the financial transaction services space that engage in global money transfers.Industry participants having exposure to the cross-border business leave no stone unturned to devise platforms backed by an interconnected banking network and sound expertise in the seamless processing of digital payments. Amid the ongoing recovery of cross-border travel, these platforms inevitably reap benefits for the players.An Active M&amp;A Strategy: Participants of the financial transaction services space frequently resort to the M&amp;A strategy to upgrade their capabilities in addition to making uninterrupted technology investments. The strategy reflects industry players’ focus on bolstering their customer base, entering new markets and establishing a significant share across the global market.The primary aim behind these deals is to bring about diversification benefits that differentiate an organization from its industry peers. The current year is expected to be exciting, with respect to M&amp;A deals, according to PwC’s Global M&amp;A Industry Trends: 2023 Outlook.Zacks Industry Rank Instills OptimismThe group’s Zacks Industry Rank, which is basically the average of the Zacks Rank of all-member stocks, indicates bright near-term prospects.

97,568dbb60-cf02-423c-8cb6-5b6273be0b60,MAR,2023-02-27,Hitting the Books: Why America once leaded its gasoline,Engadget,https://finance.yahoo.com/m/568dbb60-cf02-423c-8cb6-5b6273be0b60/hitting-the-books%3A-why.html,1677425405,STORY,"['CL=F', 'RB=F']","[Engine knock, wherein fuel ignites unevenly along the cylinder wall resulting in damaging percussive shockwaves, is an issue that automakers have struggled to mitigate since the days of the Model T. The industry's initial attempts to solve the problem — namely tetraethyl lead — were, in hindsight, a huge mistake, having endumbened and stupefied an entire generation of Americans with their neurotoxic byproducts.Dr. Vaclav Smil, Professor Emeritus at the University of Manitoba in Winnipeg, examines the short-sighted economic reasoning that lead to leaded gas rather than a nationwide network of ethanol stations in his new book Invention and Innovation: A Brief History of Hype and Failure. Lead gas is far from the only presumed advance to go over like a lead balloon. Invention and Innovation is packed with tales of humanity's best-intentioned, most ill-conceived and generally half-cocked ideas — from airships and hyperloops to DDT and CFCs.Oh man there is a lot going on here. Basically, imagine if they invented LSD in the Victorian Era and then cross that with a Where's Waldo puzzle.Excerpted from Invention and Innovation: A Brief History of Hype and Failure by Professor Vaclav Smil. Reprinted with permission from The MIT Press. Copyright 2023.Just seven years later Henry Ford began to sell his Model T, the first mass-produced affordable and durable passenger car, and in 1911 Charles Kettering, who later played a key role in developing leaded gasoline, designed the first practical electric starter, which obviated dangerous hand cranking. And although hard-topped roads were still in short supply even in the eastern part of the US, their construction began to accelerate, with the country’s paved highway length more than doubling between 1905 and 1920. No less important, decades of crude oil discoveries accompanied by advances in refining provided the liquid fuels needed for the expansion of the new transportation, and in 1913 Standard Oil of Indiana introduced William Burton’s thermal cracking of crude oil, the process that increased gasoline yield while reducing the share of volatile compounds that make up the bulk of natural gasolines.Story continuesBut having more affordable and more reliable cars, more paved roads, and a dependable supply of appropriate fuel still left a problem inherent in the combustion cycle used by car engines: the propensity to violent knocking (pinging). In a perfectly operating gasoline engine, gas combustion is initiated solely by a timed spark at the top of the combustion chamber and the resulting flame front moves uniformly across the cylinder volume. Knocking is caused by spontaneous ignitions (small explosions, mini-detonations) taking place in the remaining gases before they are reached by the flame front initiated by sparking. Knocking creates high pressures (up to 18 MPa, or nearly up to 180 times the normal atmospheric level), and the resulting shock waves, traveling at speeds greater than sound, vibrate the combustion chamber walls and produce the telling sounds of a knocking, malfunctioning engine.Knocking sounds alarming at any speed, but when an engine operates at a high load it can be very destructive. Severe knocking can cause brutal irreparable engine damage, including cylinder head erosion, broken piston rings, and melted pistons; and any knocking reduces an engine’s efficiency and releases more pollutants; in particular, it results in higher nitrogen oxide emissions. The capacity to resist knocking— that is, fuel’s stability— is based on the pressure at which fuel will spontaneously ignite and has been universally measured in octane numbers, which are usually displayed by filling stations in bold black numbers on a yellow background.Octane (C8H18) is one of the alkanes (hydrocarbons with the general formula CnH2n + 2) that form anywhere between 10 to 40 percent of light crude oils, and one of its isomers (compounds with the same number of carbon and hydrogen atoms but with a different molecular structure), 2,2,4-trimethypentane (iso-octane), was taken as the maximum (100 percent) on the octane rating scale because the compound completely prevents any knocking. The higher the octane rating of gasoline, the more resistant the fuel is to knocking, and engines can operate more efficiently with higher compression ratios. North American refiners now offer three octane grades, regular gasoline (87), midgrade fuel (89), and premium fuel mixes (91– 93).During the first two decades of the twentieth century, the earliest phase of automotive expansion, there were three options to minimize or eliminate destructive knocking. The first one was to keep the compression ratios of internal combustion engines relatively low, below 4.3:1: Ford’s best-selling Model T, rolled out in 1908, had a compression ratio of 3.98:1. The second one was to develop smaller but more efficient engines running on better fuel, and the third one was to use additives that would prevent the uncontrolled ignition. Keeping compression ratios low meant wasting fuel, and the reduced engine efficiency was of a particular concern during the years of rapid post–World War I economic expansion as rising car ownership of more powerful and more spacious cars led to concerns about the long-term adequacy of domestic crude oil supplies and the growing dependence on imports. Consequently, additives offered the easiest way out: they would allow using lower-quality fuel in more powerful engines operating more efficiently with higher compression ratios.During the first two decades of the twentieth century there was considerable interest in ethanol (ethyl alcohol, C2H6O or CH3CH2OH), both as a car fuel and as a gasoline additive. Numerous tests proved that engines using pure ethanol would never knock, and ethanol blends with kerosene and gasoline were tried in Europe and in the US. Ethanol’s well-known proponents included Alexander Graham Bell, Elihu Thomson, and Henry Ford (although Ford did not, as many sources erroneously claim, design the Model T to run on ethanol or to be a dual-fuel vehicle; it was to be fueled by gasoline); Charles Kettering considered it to be the fuel of the future.But three disadvantages complicated ethanol’s large-scale adoption: it was more expensive than gasoline, it was not available in volumes sufficient to meet the rising demand for automotive fuel, and increasing its supply, even only if it were used as the dominant additive, would have claimed significant shares of crop production. At that time there were no affordable, direct ways to produce the fuel on a large scale from abundant cellulosic waste such as wood or straw: cellulose had first to be hydrolyzed by sulfuric acid and the resulting sugars were then fermented. That is why the fuel ethanol was made mostly from the same food crops that were used to make (in much smaller volumes) alcohol for drinking and medicinal and industrial uses.The search for a new, effective additive began in 1916 in Charles Kettering’s Dayton Research Laboratories with Thomas Midgley, a young (born in 1889) mechanical engineer, in charge of this effort. In July 1918 a report prepared in collaboration with the US Army and the US Bureau of Mines listed ethyl alcohol, benzene, and a cyclohexane as the compounds that did not produce any knocking in high-compression engines. In 1919, when Kettering was hired by GM to head its new research division, he defined the challenge as one of averting a looming fuel shortage: the US domestic crude oil supply was expected to be gone in fifteen years, and “if we could successfully raise the compression of our motors . . . we could double the mileage and thereby lengthen this period to 30 years.” Kettering saw two routes toward that goal, by using a high-volume additive (ethanol or, as tests showed, fuel with 40 percent benzene that eliminated any knocking) or a low-percentage alternative, akin to but better than the 1 percent iodine solution that was accidentally discovered in 1919 to have the same effect.In early 1921 Kettering learned about Victor Lehner’s synthesis of selenium oxychloride at the University of Wisconsin. Tests showed it to be a highly effective but, as expected, also a highly corrosive anti-knocking compound, but they led directly to considering compounds of other elements in group 16 of the periodic table: both diethyl selenide and diethyl telluride showed even better anti-knocking properties, but the latter compound was poisonous when inhaled or absorbed through skin and had a powerful garlicky smell. Tetraethyl tin was the next compound found to be modestly effective, and on December 9, 1921, a solution of 1 percent tetraethyl lead (TEL) — (C2H5)4 Pb — produced no knock in the test engine, and soon was found to be effective even when added in concentrations as low as 0.04 percent by volume.TEL was originally synthesized in Germany by Karl Jacob Löwig in 1853 and had no previous commercial use. In January 1922, DuPont and Standard Oil of New Jersey were contracted to produce TEL, and by February 1923 the new fuel (with the additive mixed into the gasoline at pumps by means of simple devices called ethylizers) became available to the public in a small number of filling stations. Even as the commitment to TEL was going ahead, Midgley and Kettering conceded that “unquestionably alcohol is the fuel of the future,” and estimates showed that a 20 percent blend of ethanol and gasoline needed in 1920 could be supplied by using only about 9 percent of the country’s grain and sugar crops while providing an additional market for US farmers. And during the interwar period many European and some tropical countries used blends of 10– 25 percent ethanol (made from surplus food crops and paper mill wastes) and gasoline, admittedly for relatively small markets as the pre–World War II ownership of family cars in Europe was only a fraction of the US mean.Other known alternatives included vapor-phase cracked refinery liquids, benzene blends, and gasoline from naphthenic crudes (containing little or no wax). Why did GM, well aware of these realities, decide not only to pursue just the TEL route but also to claim (despite its own correct understanding) that there were no available alternatives: “So far as we know at the present time, tetraethyl lead is the only material available which can bring about these results”? Several factors help to explain the choice. The ethanol route would have required a mass-scale development of a new industry dedicated to an automotive fuel additive that could not be controlled by GM. Moreover, as already noted, the preferable option, producing ethanol from cellulosic waste (crop residues, wood), rather than from food crops, was too expensive to be practical. In fact, the large-scale production of cellulosic ethanol by new enzymatic conversions, promised to be of epoch-making importance in the twenty-first century, has failed its expectations, and by 2020 high-volume US production of ethanol (used as an anti-knocking additive) continued to be based on fermenting corn: in 2020 it claimed almost exactly one-third of the country’s corn harvest.]"
98,f5c807f6-612b-3505-a0d8-4922a19636f3,MAR,2023-02-27,Energy & precious metals - weekly review and outlook,Investing.com,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/energy-precious-metals-weekly-review-063610314.html,1677393370,STORY,"['GC=F', 'CL=F', 'HO=F']","[By Barani KrishnanInvesting.com -- While the S&amp;P 500 had its worst week of this year from some of the Fed’s harshest inflation rhetoric in months, oil still found a way to finish in neutral as longs dived deep to buy into a market that scraped three-week lows just two days earlier.At the heart of the recovery was the unwavering faith of oil bulls that Chinese demand will return bigger than ever to the market with the largest crude importer having ditched all COVID controls. With the anniversary of the Ukraine invasion dawning upon us, many admirers of Vladimir Putin were also cheering him on in oil trading forums to make life harder for energy-consuming countries with even deeper Russian production cuts than those speculated in a Reuters story this week.One would imagine that the long side of the crude trade would be happy with the week’s outcome given what the alternative could have been - the dollar was at a seven-week peak and two-year Treasuries hit their highest since 2007.Yet, after-hours bar talk on Friday, at least the one I was privy to with several hedge fund people, suggested a growing suspicion among longs that the EIA, or Energy Information Administration, was out to screw them by deliberately overestimating crude stockpiles week after week.At stake was a build of roughly 60 million barrels in crude reported by the EIA since the start of the year, along with the caveat of so-called adjustments stated in each weekly report to reflect what the agency figured had gone missing to correctly reflect balances after all forms of supply and demand.This latest Weekly Petroleum Status Report particularly kicked up a storm after the EIA stated in line 13 an adjustment of 2.097 million barrels per day that if calculated over seven working days would amount to 14.511 million barrels. The prior week, it was 13.8 million barrels.Phil Flynn, an analyst at Chicago’s Price Futures Group and a self-proclaimed oil bull, took up the argument in his Friday note, saying “these adjustments are way out of whack with historical norms”.Story continuesTo make his point, Flynn used the EIA’s own reference that typically an adjustment was supposed to be less than 2% of refinery crude oil inputs. The inputs for the week ended Feb. 17 were at 15 million barrels, meaning a 2% adjustment should have been around 300,000 barrels at most. The 14.511 million barrels the EIA reported as an adjustment was closer to a 14.5% adjustment, Flynn argued.He signed off with a further lament that, regardless of the fact of the matter, “the EIA tells us that based off that adjustment, U.S. commercial crude oil inventories are about 9% above the five-year average for this time of year.”What perhaps was missed by many was the tweet by EIA Administrator Joe DeCarolis on Friday that addressed the controversy. In fact, DeCarolis had issued a similar tweet in November, just as discrepancies between supply and demand had prompted the EIA to make larger weekly adjustments.In his latest tweet, DeCarolis said: “We've had two weeks in a row with large crude oil adjustments indicating undersupply: 2 million bbl/d both weeks.” He added: “Remember: weekly numbers are highly variable; better to focus on the WPSR 4-week average or PSM. We'll be releasing the findings of our 90-day study very soon.”And what does the 4-week average for the latest full month - January - say?In the Monthly Energy Review, under “stocks”, the EIA has a “preliminary” estimate of 1.61M barrels - virtually matching the 1.6072M reported for the week ended Jan. 27.In a foreword to the numbers, the EIA says: “These data are usually preliminary (and sometimes estimated or forecasted) and likely to be revised the following month.”The variance resulting from adjustments, after all supply and demand are accounted for, is usually negligible.Aside from the foreword of the energy review, the EIA does alert readers in the footnotes of the actual data itself that the numbers may not add up right away, though they do eventually. “Stocks are at end of period. Totals may not equal sum of components due to independent rounding.”The crude oil adjustment is perhaps the most frequently misunderstood component of the EIA’s work.Key weekly crude oil quantities are linked through the following balance relationship: Domestic Production + Imports = Refinery Inputs + Exports + Stock Change.The stock change - the takeaway for traders in each week’s data that can decide millions of dollars in position wins or losses - is basically the difference between total stock builds and stock draws.There is actually nothing really mysterious about the weekly adjustments made by the EIA as all the information is easily searchable online, with the agency even having published a blog or two over the years to help people better understand these.Also, in comments carried by MarketWatch this week, the EIA’s DeCarolis said in a direct response to the controversy:“Ideally, the adjustment would be zero since the crude oil supplied has to go somewhere, but there is a degree of uncertainty associated with each term, stemming from imprecise statistical sampling and modeling inaccuracies.""My question for the naysayers of the government data is: How different has the weekly supply-demand reporting by the API, or the American Petroleum Institute, been?The API, as traders know, works on numbers reported voluntarily by members of the industry. As such, the information it issues the night prior to an EIA release can never be as comprehensive. Yet, as a custodian of the industry, one would, in theory, imagine the API to be “fairer” to those seeking higher prices. And what did the API report for last week? 10M barrels versus the 7.7M reported by the EIA.I can understand the consternation of oil bulls if the API had reported a 10M draw for last week versus the 7.7M build cited by the EIA. But no, what the industry group had was 10M back-to-back for two weeks. Added up, that’s 20M versus the two-week tally of around 24M on the government’s side. There is a variance - one that will be worked out when all the data is in - but it’s not miles apart as oil bulls think or contend.John Kilduff, founding partner at New York energy hedge fund Again Capital, has this to say for those who still feel done over by the EIA’s adjustments:“These variances have hurt those on the short side of oil too. The difference though is you don’t hear them complaining about it, at least not as much as the longs do. At the end of the day, these numbers are real and they are what the whole world refers to as U.S. oil data. If you still feel otherwise, remember: You can’t fight City Hall.”Oil: Market Settlements and Activity New York-traded West Texas Intermediate, or WTI, crude for April delivery did a final trade of $76.45 on Friday, after settling the official session at $76.32 per barrel - up 93 cents, or 1.2%, on the day.Earlier in the session, WTI fell as much as $1.28. But after the turnaround, the U.S. crude benchmark finished the week down just 2 cents, practically flat.Brent for April delivery did a final trade of $83.23 on Friday, after settling the official session at $83.16 per barrel - up 96 cents, or 1.2%, on the day.Brent fell as much as $1.12 earlier in the session. For the week, the global crude benchmark finished up 13 cents, or nearly flat too.Oil: Price OutlookWTI is at an inflection point after a narrow $4-trading range through the week with just two days of loss aversion at the end, said Sunil Kumar Dixit, chief technical strategist at SKCharting.com.“The upside remains capped at $78 initially, above which the weekly Middle Bollinger Band of $80.15 looks like the next challenge,” said Dixit. “Strong acceptance above $80.20 will be seen as an endorsement for the major resistance zone at the 100-week SMA (Simple Moving Average) of $83.90 and the 50-week EMA (Exponential Moving Average) of $84.70.”Failure to make a sustainable break above $80.20 will cause fresh weakness, prompting a quick drop to the recent low of under $74, he said. “WTI looks vulnerable to the ascending trend line support at $72.20,” Dixit added.Natural gas: Market Settlements and Activity The most-active April gas contract on the New York Mercantile Exchange’s Henry Hub did a final trade of $2.726 per mmBtu, or metric million British thermal units, on Friday. It earlier settled the official session at $2.4510 — up 1.9 cents, or 0.8%. That gain was in addition to the previous day’s 5.8% rise that added a little more insulation for the contract from a retest of the $2 support that would open the trapdoor for its plunge again into $1 territory.For the week, Henry Hub’s most-active gas contract rose 4.3%, marking only the second positive week in 10 for futures of the heating oil. March, the front-month contract on the hub, expired at Friday’s close, settling at $2. March gas fell to a 2-½-year low of $1.967 on Thursday.The higher close of the past two sessions came after the Energy Information Administration reported that U.S. utilities pulled 71 bcf, or billion cubic feet, from U.S. natural gas storage during the week ended Feb. 17 for power generation and heating. That draw was just slightly above the 67-bcf consumption expected by industry analysts for last week. It also paled when compared to the 100-bcf usage from the prior week to Feb. 10. Yet, it seemed enough for now to keep gas anchored at mid-$2 levels.Natural gas: Price OutlookNatural gas’s price action over the past week indicates consolidation above the $2 support and the possibility of some bounce towards $2.78 “on a conservative perspective”, said Dixit of SKCharting.“On an immediate basis, the 4-hour chart, the RSI (Relative Strength Index) at 71 and the Stochastics at 99/95 all are giving signs of exhaustion at the lower end,” he said.“For the short term, $2.33 is the support. If this is broken, it can push prices down towards $2.15.”Resistance shifts to $2.68-$2.78 may be tested if the price action is supported by demand above the daily Middle Bollinger Band of $2.48, Dixit said.“If the short-term rebound proves real above $2.78, we may be looking for the next leg higher of $3.5, which would really require strong energy among gas bulls.”Gold: Market Settlements and Activity ​​Gold for April delivery on New York’s Comex did a final trade of $1,818 an ounce after officially settling Friday’s trading at $1,817.10, down $9.70, or 0.5%.For the week, the benchmark gold futures contract lost $23.30, or 1.3%.The spot price of gold, more closely followed than futures by some traders, settled at $1,811.60, down $10.71, or 0.6% on the day.At the heart of the gold trade is the sinking feeling that the metal might be consumed by the same inflation it is supposed to be a hedge against, as the Federal Reserve gears to ratchet up rate hikes again amid stickier-than-thought price growth.The latest trouble to gold came in the form of the Fed’s preferred inflation indicator - the Personal Consumption Expenditures, or PCE, Index - which grew 5.4% in the year to January, beating forecasts for the month as well as its previous growth in December.The dollar hit a seven-week high against a basket of major currencies while the yields on the 2-year U.S. note hit their highest since 2007 amid a near reach of the 4% level for the benchmark 10-Year note.All these were on the back of expectations that the Fed will resort to more hawkish monetary action amid the “hotter inflation in the U.S.”, economist Greg Michalowski said in a post on the ForexLive forum.U.S. consumer sentiment, meanwhile, hit a 13-month high in February, according to a survey by the University of Michigan that showed Americans more optimistic about spending at a time the Fed actually needs them to show restraint.Gold: Price Outlook With the dollar back on a ramp-up, the spot price of gold looks set to advance on declines, said SKCharting’s Dixit.“Going further, the 100-week SMA of $1,808.80 which stopped the decline of gold may be challenged further by gold bears trying to dig in a bit deeper into the 50-week EMA of $1,803, followed by the weekly Middle Bollinger Band of $1,796 and the 100 Day SMA of $1,792.”Dixit said if selling intensifies below $1,800, gold is likely to witness a breaking through below the $1,796-$1,792 support areas and reach the $1,788 critical support.It could even test the 200-Day SMA of $1,775 before resuming an uptrend, he said.“As gold’s daily RSI has already reached 31, any further sell off below $1,800 or a drop to $1,788-$1,775 will push the daily RSI to extreme oversold conditions, calling for an imminent rebound to retest the broken-support-turned-resistance zone of $1,828.”Disclaimer: Barani Krishnan does not hold positions in the commodities and securities he writes about.Related ArticlesOil flat on week as U.S. inventories rise but Russia cuts supplyAnalysis: Decree adds to doubts about Mexican lithium industry's future]"

But on the bright side, if you buy shares in a high quality company at the right price, you can gain well over 100%. For instance, the price of NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) stock is up an impressive 295% over the last five years. Also pleasing for shareholders was the 49% gain in the last three months. This could be related to the recent financial results, released recently - you can catch up on the most recent data by reading our company report.The past week has proven to be lucrative for NVIDIA investors, so let's see if fundamentals drove the company's five-year performance. See our latest analysis for NVIDIA In his essay The Superinvestors of Graham-and-Doddsville Warren Buffett described how share prices do not always rationally reflect the value of a business. One imperfect but simple way to consider how the market perception of a company has shifted is to compare the change in the earnings per share (EPS) with the share price movement.During five years of share price growth, NVIDIA achieved compound earnings per share (EPS) growth of 6.9% per year. This EPS growth is slower than the share price growth of 32% per year, over the same period. So it's fair to assume the market has a higher opinion of the business than it did five years ago. And that's hardly shocking given the track record of growth. This optimism is visible in its fairly high P/E ratio of 131.46.The graphic below depicts how EPS has changed over time (unveil the exact values by clicking on the image).earnings-per-share-growthBefore buying or selling a stock, we always recommend a close examination of historic growth trends, available here.What About Dividends?As well as measuring the share price return, investors should also consider the total shareholder return (TSR). Whereas the share price return only reflects the change in the share price, the TSR includes the value of dividends (assuming they were reinvested) and the benefit of any discounted capital raising or spin-off. It's fair to say that the TSR gives a more complete picture for stocks that pay a dividend. We note that for NVIDIA the TSR over the last 5 years was 299%, which is better than the share price return mentioned above. This is largely a result of its dividend payments!Story continuesA Different PerspectiveWhile it's certainly disappointing to see that NVIDIA shares lost 4.4% throughout the year, that wasn't as bad as the market loss of 10%. Longer term investors wouldn't be so upset, since they would have made 32%, each year, over five years. In the best case scenario the last year is just a temporary blip on the journey to a brighter future. While it is well worth considering the different impacts that market conditions can have on the share price, there are other factors that are even more important. To that end, you should be aware of the   3 warning signs  we've spotted with NVIDIA .Of course NVIDIA may not be the best stock to buy.

Using the most recent financial data, we'll take a look at whether the stock is fairly priced by taking the forecast future cash flows of the company and discounting them back to today's value. One way to achieve this is by employing the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model. It may sound complicated, but actually it is quite simple!We generally believe that a company's value is the present value of all of the cash it will generate in the future. However, a DCF is just one valuation metric among many, and it is not without flaws. For those who are keen learners of equity analysis, the Simply Wall St analysis model here may be something of interest to you. Check out our latest analysis for McKesson Step By Step Through The CalculationWe're using the 2-stage growth model, which simply means we take in account two stages of company's growth. In the initial period the company may have a higher growth rate and the second stage is usually assumed to have a stable growth rate. In the first stage we need to estimate the cash flows to the business over the next ten years. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.A DCF is all about the idea that a dollar in the future is less valuable than a dollar today, so we need to discount the sum of these future cash flows to arrive at a present value estimate:Story continues10-year free cash flow (FCF) forecast2023202420252026202720282029203020312032 Levered FCF ($, Millions) US$3.27bUS$3.63bUS$3.59bUS$3.14bUS$3.86bUS$3.91bUS$3.96bUS$4.03bUS$4.10bUS$4.17bGrowth Rate Estimate SourceAnalyst x6Analyst x6Analyst x5Analyst x2Analyst x2Est @ 1.12%Est @ 1.40%Est @ 1.60%Est @ 1.74%Est @ 1.84% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 6.9% US$3.1kUS$3.2kUS$2.9kUS$2.4kUS$2.8kUS$2.6kUS$2.5kUS$2.4kUS$2.3kUS$2.1k(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$26bAfter calculating the present value of future cash flows in the initial 10-year period, we need to calculate the Terminal Value, which accounts for all future cash flows beyond the first stage. For a number of reasons a very conservative growth rate is used that cannot exceed that of a country's GDP growth. In this case we have used the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield (2.1%) to estimate future growth. In the same way as with the 10-year 'growth' period, we discount future cash flows to today's value, using a cost of equity of 6.9%.Terminal Value (TV)= FCF2032 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$4.2b× (1 + 2.1%) ÷ (6.9%– 2.1%) = US$89bPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$89b÷ ( 1 + 6.9%)10= US$46bThe total value is the sum of cash flows for the next ten years plus the discounted terminal value, which results in the Total Equity Value, which in this case is US$72b. The last step is to then divide the equity value by the number of shares outstanding. Relative to the current share price of US$359, the company appears quite undervalued at a 32% discount to where the stock price trades currently. Remember though, that this is just an approximate valuation, and like any complex formula - garbage in, garbage out.dcfThe AssumptionsWe would point out that the most important inputs to a discounted cash flow are the discount rate and of course the actual cash flows. If you don't agree with these result, have a go at the calculation yourself and play with the assumptions. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at McKesson as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 6.9%, which is based on a levered beta of 0.807. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.SWOT Analysis for McKessonStrengthEarnings growth over the past year exceeded the industry.Debt is well covered by earnings and cashflows.WeaknessDividend is low compared to the top 25% of dividend payers in the Healthcare market.OpportunityAnnual earnings are forecast to grow for the next 3 years.Good value based on P/E ratio and estimated fair value.ThreatTotal liabilities exceed total assets, which raises the risk of financial distress.Annual earnings are forecast to grow slower than the American market.Looking Ahead:Although the valuation of a company is important, it ideally won't be the sole piece of analysis you scrutinize for a company. It's not possible to obtain a foolproof valuation with a DCF model. Instead the best use for a DCF model is to test certain assumptions and theories to see if they would lead to the company being undervalued or overvalued. For example, changes in the company's cost of equity or the risk free rate can significantly impact the valuation. What is the reason for the share price sitting below the intrinsic value?

The company's stock saw a double-digit share price rise of over 10% in the past couple of months on the NYSE. As a large-cap stock with high coverage by analysts, you could assume any recent changes in the company’s outlook is already priced into the stock. However, what if the stock is still a bargain? Let’s take a look at Walt Disney’s outlook and value based on the most recent financial data to see if the opportunity still exists. View our latest analysis for Walt Disney Is Walt Disney Still Cheap?Great news for investors – Walt Disney is still trading at a fairly cheap price. My valuation model shows that the intrinsic value for the stock is $136.95, but it is currently trading at US$100 on the share market, meaning that there is still an opportunity to buy now. Although, there may be another chance to buy again in the future. This is because Walt Disney’s beta (a measure of share price volatility) is high, meaning its price movements will be exaggerated relative to the rest of the market. If the market is bearish, the company's shares will likely fall by more than the rest of the market, providing a prime buying opportunity.What does the future of Walt Disney look like?earnings-and-revenue-growthFuture outlook is an important aspect when you’re looking at buying a stock, especially if you are an investor looking for growth in your portfolio. Buying a great company with a robust outlook at a cheap price is always a good investment, so let’s also take a look at the company's future expectations. Walt Disney's earnings over the next few years are expected to double, indicating a very optimistic future ahead. This should lead to stronger cash flows, feeding into a higher share value.What This Means For YouAre you a shareholder? Since DIS is currently undervalued, it may be a great time to accumulate more of your holdings in the stock. With a positive outlook on the horizon, it seems like this growth has not yet been fully factored into the share price. However, there are also other factors such as financial health to consider, which could explain the current undervaluation.Story continuesAre you a potential investor? If you’ve been keeping an eye on DIS for a while, now might be the time to make a leap. Its buoyant future outlook isn’t fully reflected in the current share price yet, which means it’s not too late to buy DIS. But before you make any investment decisions, consider other factors such as the strength of its balance sheet, in order to make a well-informed buy.Since timing is quite important when it comes to individual stock picking, it's worth taking a look at what those latest analysts forecasts are.

Tele Columbus is investing in the next-generation network to enable sustainable business growth that can consistently deliver scalable, high-quality digital entertainment and business service experiences while managing costs and environmental considerations effectively. As a key to this initiative, the initial launch of the new platform will take place in early 2023.Tele Columbus AG is one of Germany’s leading fiber network operators which reaches more than 3 million homes. Via its brand PŸUR, the company offers high-speed internet including telephony and more than 200 TV channels. All of this via a digital entertainment platform that combines linear TV with video on demand enter-tainment. To its housing association partners the Tele Columbus Group offers tailored models of cooperation and state-of-the-art services such as telemetric and tenant portals. As a full-service partner for municipalities and regional utilities, the company is actively supporting the fiber-based infrastructure and broadband internet expansion in Germany. To remain profitable, relevant and differentiated in a growing, highly-competitive market, Tele Columbus decided to move from its existing network architecture to an open architecture to gain flexibility, increased agility, optimized user quality of experience, as well as significantly improved return on investment (ROI) and total cost of ownership (TCO).Story continuesConceiving Tele Columbus’s Cloud Metro NetworkFollowing consultancy and comprehensive validations led by NEC 5G Transport Network Center of Excellence (CoE) in EMEA, Juniper’s Cloud Metro solution was chosen by Tele Columbus to create a Converged Interconnect Network (CIN) that enables all consumer and business services to be managed and delivered more cost-effectively from a single infrastructure.Sustainable expansion for the future was a key consideration for Tele Columbus. Juniper Networks™ ACX7000 Family products offer category-leading port speed options to help customers grow in-place as their capacity needs increase, allowing easy transition from 100G to 400G with different choices of optics. The ACX7000’s future proof performance enables longer system life, better economics and ultimately reduced e-waste.The ability of the ACX7000 Family to support scale-out configurations for distributed access enables more optical reach closer to users, helping Tele Columbus to deliver the best possible user experience consistently. The ACX7000’s layer-3 design with better link efficiency enables easy, economical expansion into new sites and investment protection to absorb increased capacity for the future.NEC is providing xHaul transformation services tailored to meet Tele Columbus’s business requirements. The services are based on its CoE’s global telecom expertise combined with local engineering support for Tele Columbus throughout design, deployment and operation, including training and optimization efforts, to ensure that the introduction of the new platform enhances their service quality and competitiveness.Flexibility &amp; AgilityTele Columbus wanted to build its new network and migrate services in a phased approach. The initial phase—data centers, network core and metro network—is underway, with plans to connect the first tranche of subscribers in the first half of 2023. Ongoing phases will follow, leading to a complete, carefully-managed migration to Cloud Metro including automation for operational efficiency over time.The simplified approach to technology and deployment from Juniper and NEC, including fewer components and a single operating system (Junos® OS Evolved) end-to-end, was also attractive to Tele Columbus.Tele Columbus has a highly proactive approach to its sustainability responsibilities, so it was keen to ensure investment in a new infrastructure that supported its strategy and delivered improved TCO.""German subscribers – as elsewhere - are already focused on the performance, scalability and reliability of digital services as those will become even more important differentiators in the future. In order to meet these expectations in the context of exponential data growth, we stepped ahead transforming our technology platform and by that shaping our business for the future. The Cloud Metro solution, the partnership of Juniper and NEC and attentive local support matched our needs and has shown us the value of simplicity, innovation and open, multi-vendor principles. This has enabled a migration path that honors Tele Columbus’ vision, sustainability imperatives and commercial considerations front and center.""- Michael Fränkle, Chief Technology Officer, Tele Columbus AG""NEC is honored to contribute to Tele Columbus’s transformation journey in tight coordination with Juniper.

A fresh round of layoffs at Salesforce have just been uncorked....at a company that has only known aggressive hiring. Employees are questioning leadership at the tech titan.Co-CEO Bret Taylor is no longer co-CEO of Salesforce — instead he's off to launch an AI startup the serial entrepreneur tells me. Slack founder Stewart Butterfield, who stayed on when the company was acquired by Salesforce, is still founder...but no longer with the parent company.Salesforce co-founder Marc Benioff is back at the CEO helm, after attempting again to pullback from day to day duties (by delegating to a co-CEO) and focus more on his vast philanthropic ventures.To top it all off the company is staring down the barrel of five sharks in the field of activist money management: Elliott Management, Starboard Value, Inclusive Capital, ValueAct, and Third Point.This is an unprecedented activist versus public company battle, pros have told Yahoo Finance. How it ends is wildly unclear, but is a situation just as important as Wednesday's earnings report.""While the involvement of five activist investors has likely been the primary driver of CRM stock of late, quarterly results probably still matter (though not as much as usual), and how those results are delivered may be more relevant than ever,"" said Guggenheim analyst John DiFucci.Below, Yahoo Finance breaks down this complicated situation at large-cap tech name Salesforce. The drama is high, and it could all be coming down to one final epic conclusion.Story continuesWhat Yahoo Finance Is Watching: Salesforce EarningsWhat sources tell us is top of mind on the Street:How quickly are sales deteriorating inside of the broader tech pullback?What does the pipeline of future business look like?Does Marc Benioff acknowledge the activist situation?Are more layoffs needed?Consensus is that Salesforce warns on sales and earnings for 2023 – but how bad is it?The Vibe Among Wall Street AnalystsAnalysts are generally expecting a muted tone from Salesforce on earnings day.“For Benioff and Salesforce the actual quarter and FY24 take a back seat to the fluid activist situation which is happening at Salesforce with the Street's patience wearing thin after a head scratcher Slack deal and slowing growth/underachieving margins front and center.” -Wedbush analyst Dan Ives""Key to the Q4 call is gaining clarity on the extent to which management will turn the dial up on non-GAAP operating margins, GAAP profitability, and any future share repurchases with the emergence of activist involvement in the stock."" -Morgan Stanley analyst Keith WeissWhat the Activists Want From SalesforceSources tell Yahoo Finance that Starboard Value — led by veteran activist investor and Papa John's chairman Jeff Smith — has been disappointed in Salesforce’s expense management, but isn’t advocating for a sale of Slack.

(NYSE:LSI) Q4 2022 Earnings Call Transcript February 24, 2023Operator: Greetings. Welcome to the Life Storage Fourth Quarter Earnings Release Conference Call. Please note, this conference is being recorded. I will now turn the conference over to your host, Brent Maedl. You may begin.Brent Maedl: Good morning and thank you for joining us today for the fourth quarter 2022 earnings conference call of Life Storage. Leading today's discussion will be Joe Saffire, Chief Executive Officer of Life Storage; and Alex Gress, Chief Financial Officer. Following prepared remarks, management will accept questions from registered financial analysts.

In addition to the press release distributed yesterday, this morning, we published an investor presentation regarding the unsolicited acquisition proposal received from Public Storage on February 5, 2023. We have also furnished our supplemental package with additional detail on our financial results. These materials have been filed with the SEC and may be found on the Investor Relations section on our website at lifestorage.com. As a reminder, during today's question-and-answer session we ask that you please limit yourself to two questions to allow time for everyone who wishes to participate. Please requeue with any follow-up questions thereafter.At this time, I'll turn the call over to Joe.Joseph Saffire: Thanks, Brent and good morning, everyone. Following our discussion of our fourth quarter and full year 2020 results and financial outlook, I'll spend some time walking you through the presentation we filed with the SEC this morning and the rationale behind our Board's unanimous decision to reject Public Storage's unsolicited acquisition proposal. But first, I'm excited to announce that Life Storage crossed the threshold of $1 billion in total consolidated revenue in 2022. This is an incredible accomplishment as we now have nearly doubled the revenue we reported only 5 years ago in 2017. I am confident in our ability to continue to build on our momentum and deliver outstanding results. I am also pleased to announce that Newsweek has awarded us the Best Customer Service Award in America for storage center category for the sixth year in a row.Story continuesThis award is a testament to the best-in-class brand and team we have here at Life Storage and to our commitment to delivering exceptional, seamless experience for our customers. Turning to our quarterly results. I am pleased to report we delivered another quarter of outstanding performance across all segments of our business. While we continue to see a return to more normal seasonal trends, our operating fundamentals and business trends were very strong and remain above pre-pandemic levels. This positions us well for the year ahead. I'd like to highlight a few notable results and trends. For the quarter, we achieved same-store revenue growth of 11.8% versus the prior year period. Our strong performance was broad-based, with 85% of our major markets achieving 7% or greater revenue growth.For the year, 32 of our top 33 markets achieved greater than 10% revenue growth. These results underscore the benefits of our disciplined portfolio strategy to expand in key growth markets that allow us to benefit from regional income and population trends. In addition to this outstanding operating performance, we also completed another strong year on the acquisitions front, completing over $1 billion in wholly owned and JV acquisitions totaling 75 properties. Of this amount, $974 million and 49 stores were wholly owned acquisitions representing nearly 7% growth in our wholly-owned portfolio. We continue to expand in markets such as Dallas, Los Angeles, Phoenix, San Diego, St. Louis and New York City. Today, we own and/or operate nearly 1,200 storage facilities across 37 states and the District of Columbia.With regards to third-party management, we added 40 stores gross, net 39 stores in the fourth quarter and 107 stores for the year for a total of 440 stores at the end of 2022. Our third-party management platform had an excellent year as both our existing relationships and new relationships continue to add more facilities to our platform. During the quarter, we transitioned 29 operating facilities from other REIT platforms, further evidence that more and more owners are choosing the Life Storage brand and platform to manage their assets. This portfolio of managed stores continues to provide a strong pipeline of acquisitions. We acquired 11 managed stores during the year, representing nearly 1/4 of our wholly-owned acquisition volume. Our operating trends thus far in 2023 demonstrate that we are continuing our strong momentum as we achieved January month-end occupancy of 91.2% which is 150 basis points higher than pre-COVID January 2019.In fact, we had record move-ins in January. Demand remained strong. Our excellent performance in 2022 reflects the strength of our operating model and the significant progress we have made to build our portfolio with high-quality properties in attractive growth markets. In 2023, we will continue to focus on executing on our strategy to expand our portfolio and deliver best-in-class service. By doing so, we will build on our track record of strong profitable growth to continue to enhance value for our Life Storage shareholders. And with that, I will hand the call over to Alex, who will provide additional color on our performance for the quarter and the year and walk you through our 2023 financial guidance.Alex Gress: Thanks, Joe. This quarter, we reported adjusted funds from operations of $1.69 per share, an increase of 19.9% over the same quarter last year and well above the high end of our guidance. Fourth quarter same-store revenue increased 11.8% year-over-year driven by realized rates per square foot growth of 14.7% over the fourth quarter of 2021. As Joe mentioned, we continue to see the operating environment normalize. As expected, though asking rates and occupancies remain elevated, they continue to level off from their highs during the pandemic. Same-store occupancy for the quarter averaged 91.5%, or 140 basis points above pre-COVID levels. Demand remained strong through year-end, with move-ins accelerating in the last month of the quarter and through January 2023.Same-store operating expenses, excluding real estate taxes, increased 4.1% for the quarter versus the prior year period. The largest negative variances occurred in utilities, repairs and maintenance and Internet marketing. The 15.7% increase in same-store property taxes as compared to the prior year quarter reflects the impact of large tax rebates received in the fourth quarter of 2021 that reduced the comparable expense in the prior year quarter. For reference, full year property taxes increased 5.2% compared to the prior year. These quarterly increases were partially offset by a 4.3% decrease in payroll and benefits. The net effect of same-store revenue and expense performance was a 100-basis-point expansion in quarterly net operating income margin to 73.7%, resulting in 13.3% year-over-year growth in same-store NOI for the fourth quarter.With this improved performance, we again increased our dividend 11% in January as we continue to focus on increasing capital returns as we grow our business. This increase follows our 8% dividend bump this past July and marks a cumulative quarterly dividend increase of 20% since January 2022. Turning to the balance sheet. Our net debt to recurring EBITDA ratio remained strong at 4.8x at quarter end and our debt service coverage ratio was a healthy 5.2x at December 31. We had approximately $655 million available on our line of credit at quarter end, with no significant debt maturities until April of 2024, when $175 million becomes due and our average debt maturity is 5.5 years. In addition, at December 31, nearly 85% of our debt was fixed rate.Turning now to our 2023 guidance. Details of our 2023 earnings guidance and related assumptions were included in our release last night. Our 2023 same-store pool increased by 88 stores, bringing our total 2023 same-store pool count to 664 stabilized stores. We expect same-store revenue to grow between 4% and 5.5%, a majority of which will be driven by existing customer increases. Excluding property taxes, we expect other expenses to increase between 4% and 5%, while property taxes are expected to increase 6.25% to 7.25%. The cumulative effect of these assumptions would result in 3.75% to 5.25% growth in same-store NOI. We expect our wholly owned acquisitions to be between $150 million and $250 million. Based on this outlook, we anticipate adjusted FFO per share for 2023 to be between $6.75 and $6.95, or 5.2% growth over prior year at the midpoint.Additionally, as you will hear in Joe's comments shortly, we felt it was important to share with you our summary outlook for 2024. Based on what we know today, we expect low double-digit FFO per share growth in 2024, with a midpoint of 11%. With that, I'll turn the call back to Joe to discuss the presentation we filed this morning that discusses the factors that led to our Board determining that the proposal from Public Storage significantly undervalued our company and its growth prospects. Joe?Joseph Saffire: Thanks, Alex. Last week, we announced that Life Storage Board of Directors unanimously rejected the unsolicited acquisition proposal publicly announced by Public Storage on February 5, 2023. The Board's decision followed a comprehensive review of the proposal in consultation with independent financial and legal advisers. As Brent noted in his opening, this morning, we filed a presentation that provides a deeper dive into the factors that led to the Board's determination that the proposal significantly undervalues our company. I want to spend some time this morning walking through the presentation and providing more color on why we are so confident in our future and why we believe that Public Storage's proposal does not appropriately reflect the value embedded in the upside of Life Storage and our clear line of sight to continued growth and value creation.I'll start on Slide 3 of the new investor presentation we posted this morning. If you haven't seen it yet, the presentation is available in the IR section of our website and on file with the SEC. The Board's decision was grounded in the significant progress we have made over the past 5 years, creating a differentiated platform and what we believe is truly unique value creation opportunity. In this time, we have grown Life Storage from 706 stores across 28 states to a diversified footprint of nearly 1,200 stores across 37 states, primarily in the key growth markets across the Sunbelt. As we have grown, we have enhanced our operating model, building on our pioneering technology and innovating our platform to provide best-in-class service to our more than 675,000 customers.My focus since 2019 when I was appointed CEO has been to accelerate our progress by focusing on our strategic pillars to deliver profitable growth and industry-leading shareholder returns. Our operational and financial performance over the past several years demonstrates that our strategy is working. We have a robust platform to continue building on this momentum. Turning to Slide 4. The Board unanimously determined that the Public Storage's proposal significantly undervalues Life Storage and the company's prospects. Over the next several slides, I will walk you through the key elements of the Board's decision, including Life Storage's significant outperformance over the past several years and the reasons we believe we are positioned to extend our industry-leading track record.The unique opportunity we have to drive continued superior growth by scaling our platform faster and more efficiently than our peers. Our margin expansion initiatives which are leading to enhanced profitability and the belief that Public Storage's proposal was opportunistically timed and does not reflect the significant continued growth and value creation that Life Storage is poised to realize. I'll begin with the reasons we believe that the proposal does not provide adequate value for Life Storage and the company's prospects for future value creation. As you can see on Slide 6, over the past 5 years and since March of 2019, we have translated our significant growth and strong financial performance into superior returns for our shareholders.Our team has delivered industry-leading returns of nearly 100% since March of 2019 and nearly 150% over the past 5 years. The strong results and financial outlook that we announced today reflect our confidence in our ability to continue this track record. Slide 7 underscores our proven commitment to exceptional dividend growth. Providing an attractive and growing dividend for our shareholders is not something we have embraced only recently. In fact, we have raised our dividend 6 times since March of 2019 for a total increase of 80% over that period. Growing our dividend is a key focus and we intend to continue to do so as we drive enhanced FFO growth over the coming quarters and years. The substantial value we have driven for our shareholders over the past several years has been underpinned by our significant financial outperformance.Building, real estate, businessPhoto by Alex Mihis on UnsplashOn Slide 8, you can see that Life Storage has beat or met analyst consensus for FFO per share every quarter since the beginning of 2018, with the exception of 1 quarter at the start of COVID in 2020. We have also achieved or exceeded our own guidance for FFO every year over that period, including substantial outperformance in 2021 and 2022. We hold our team to high standards and time and time again our team has delivered. The financial outlook that we have announced today reflects our confidence in our team's ability to build on this substantial momentum in '23, in '24 and for the long-term. In addition to our outperformance expectations, we have outperformed our peer group. On Slide 9, you can see that. Since 2019, we are consistently at or near the top of the list on FFO per share growth.And if you include forecasted 2023 results Life Storage is the highest FFO per share CAGR in our peer group at 13.3%. This compares to Public Storage at 9.3%. As Alex and I mentioned earlier, we anticipate industry-leading growth in 2024. Slide 10 shows our expectation of low double-digit FFO per share growth in 2024, with a midpoint of 11%. Our growth projections are based on a number of different factors, including continued same-store growth, contributions from recent requisitions, the positive impact of lease-up assets, growth in fee revenue from third-party management and joint ventures and redevelopments. We expect to continue leading the industry in terms of growth. Moving now to our operating strategy and track record of execution which have allowed us to deliver best-in-class performance across our portfolio.Let's turn to Slide 12. Our best-in-class operating performance is driven by accelerating top and bottom line growth. Over the past 3 years, we have driven leading same-store revenue growth. Through our strong operating fundamentals and disciplined expense control, we have translated this top line growth into same-store NOI outperformance. Our leadership position is bolstered by our footprint in rapidly growing markets, as you can see on Slides 13 and 14. Over the past 3 years, we have reshaped our portfolio to focus on key Sunbelt markets where we benefit from attractive demographics and higher projected growth than our peers. We believe expanding in the right markets is critical to future growth. Between our existing footprint and our relationships through our third-party management and joint ventures, we have a built-in pipeline to continue growing in markets supported by strong demographic tailwinds.Our advantaged geographic footprint is clearly a factor in rejecting the proposal. A key component of our portfolio strategy and our superior value creation has been our focus on expanding in the Sunbelt which I mentioned on the prior slide, offers compelling demand trends and population demographics. Since 2019, we have acquired 140 new properties in the Sunbelt, totaling approximately 70% of our acquisitions over this period. Though population and employment growth trends in the Sunbelt are projected to continue to drive strong demand, our peers' portfolios remain underexposed to the region. We believe our strong footprint in the Sunbelt represents a significant competitive advantage, particularly relative to companies that have focused on growth in California, where population demographics are trending in the opposite direction.Today, roughly 60% of our total store count is located in the Sunbelt states, excluding California and we expect to drive continued above-market growth in the region as we benefit from in-migration trends. With approximately 65% of our third-party and joint venture assets also in the Sunbelt, we have considerable opportunities to expand in the region. Thanks to focused planning and outstanding execution, today, Life Storage is in better markets, positioning us for continued superior growth. Turning now to our operating platform. which, together with the size of our asset base, allows us to grow faster and more efficiently than our peers. Let's turn to Slide 16. At Life Storage, we have built a model that allows us to scale our portfolio and drive superior earnings.Our leading third-party management platform and joint ventures provide us with an embedded pool of potential acquisitions in key markets, the vast majority of which are off-market opportunities. We have historically been able to capitalize on these opportunities at attractive rates as we avoid competing bids from an open market process. Further, we have a strong track record of translating these acquisitions into enhanced profitability by identifying and executing on redevelopment activities. I've been talking about our faster growth. Let me show you what that looks like. As you can see on Slide 17, since 2018, we have accelerated our store count growth by leveraging our unique external growth levers, increasing our overall footprint by 55% over that time.We have scaled our third-party management platform and joint venture portfolio at a faster rate than our overall portfolio, creating an increasing number of acquisition opportunities. Today, our portfolio of managed and joint venture asset comprises of about $8 billion in assets, approximately 65% of which are in the Sunbelt. This is a primary driver of our acquisition pipeline which currently stands at $685 million in assets, approximately 95% of which are off-market opportunities. We expect to continue to build out our pipeline as we enhance our third-party and joint venture relationships, allowing us to continue to bolster our portfolio and strengthen on our foundation for continued profitable growth. We expect our store count to increase by approximately 100 over the coming year.Growth is valuable and likely a key reason Public Storage is pursuing Life Storage. Referring now to Slide 18. The relative size of our asset base positions us to scale our portfolio more efficiently than peers, allowing us to deliver higher growth rates through our proven acquisition strategy. Our wholly owned acquisition volume since 2019, as a percentage of our total enterprise value at the year-end in 2022 is 30%. Public Storage cannot match this growth rate because of both the size of their portfolio and the overall lack of larger-scale portfolio deals. For example, Public Storage's acquisition volume over that period is only 12% of their total enterprise value. For public Storage to have achieved our growth over that period, they would have needed to spend approximately $16 billion more on acquisitions.Our smaller base compared to Public Storage means we have significant runway and more upside and can more easily deliver significant growth. That's an exciting and important differentiator for Life Storage. Turning now to Slide 19. We attribute much of our strong growth rate and continued robust acquisition pipeline to our leading third-party management program and establish joint venture relationships. Our third-party management program has seen remarkable growth since 2019, adding 227 new managed stores, including 65 net transfers from other REITs. We also continue to develop our JV portfolio of 141 stores through relationships with leading institutional and private equity partners. These relationships enable us to participate in top markets and quality properties that provide future upside with a moderate capital investment.We've increasingly leaned on our pool of managed and JV assets to fuel our acquisition pipeline in recent years. In fact, 37% of our total acquisition volume since the start of 2020 has come from these properties. These relationships also provide an attractive annual fee stream, delivering approximately $31 million in annual fee income and reduce our reliance on the public markets as an alternative source of capital. We believe the relationships we have built through these pipelines are valuable assets in and of themselves. Our partners trust Life Storage and they rely on our leading operating platform and brand. This kind of trust is a differentiator for Life Storage and it's not built overnight. It is something we earned through our hard work every day.We have heard from many of these partners and they have serious reservations about continuing their relationship with Life Storage if the company were to be acquired by Public Storage. In short, our third-party management and joint venture relationships are unique and valuable. We have been able to translate our strong external growth into significant profitability through our redevelopment initiatives to improve the quality of our assets and drive enhanced ROI and enhance margins. We are relentless in our efforts to deliver the best possible experience for our customers through ongoing investments in our owned assets. As you can see on Slide 20, since 2018, we have completed $208 million of redevelopments which have yielded stable, attractive ROIs of over 10% and translated to a 390-basis-point increase in our NOI margin.We have a strong pipeline of these initiatives underway across our portfolio which are positioned to drive future growth and cash flows as they are completed. Importantly, this is all in our control. As we continue to execute on both internal and external growth opportunities, Life Storage has the proven capabilities and dynamic operating platform to drive enhanced profitability and value for shareholders. Speaking of profitability, I will now provide a deeper dive into our margin improvement trajectory and the initiatives we have underway to sustain this momentum. Since the beginning of 2019, one of our key areas of focus has been to improve our margins and I'm pleased to say we have made substantial progress so far. The chart on 22 speaks volumes.Since 2019, we have delivered sector-leading NOI margin expansion of approximately 630 basis points. We achieved this through disciplined execution of our initiatives to improve rental rates and reduce operating expenses in our stores while maintaining best-in-class service. As we continue to advance these initiatives, we expect to deliver at least 70 basis points of additional margin uplift over the next 2 years. One point that Public Storage has brought up in his discussions around its proposal has been its relative margin differences. However, when you look beneath the surface, the margin gap is not as great as they may suggest. While Public Storage has been able to achieve higher reported NOI margins, a direct comparison of our 2 companies' margins ignores several key variables with meaningful impact on total margin differences.You can see a breakdown of these factors on Slide 23. In particular, the higher regional rent in Public Storage's key markets account for approximately 370 basis points of margin difference. These are noncontrollable factors reflecting the different geographies of the portfolios. Moreover, Public Storage benefits from a lower tax basis than Life Storage, primarily due to Proposition 13 in California. Their margins in California have inherent risk from a potential repeal of Proposition 13 which would eliminate tax rates and could remove approximately 150 basis points from their margins. When you consider the 70 basis points uplift we expect over the next 2 years, the spread between our margins shrink significantly. Given the momentum we have in increasing store profitability through our efficiency initiatives and technology rollout, we are confident that we can continue to close the margin gap as a stand-alone company.The strong growth and profitability trends in our business and our superior geographic exposure and capabilities were key factors in the Board's decision to reject Public Storage's proposal. The Board also determined that the proposal was opportunistic and fails to account for our compelling outlook and ability to continue to drive leading growth and value creation. So let me explain why we think the proposal was opportunistically timed which is covered on Slides 25 and 26. First, Life Storage has been undervalued compared to historical averages. Based on recent history, however, we believe that this dislocation in our stock price is temporary. In fact, the proposal currently reflects an implied FFO multiple of only 17.7x which is well below our 3-year average of 19.4x.In other words, it's a great proposal for Public Storage but it is clearly inadequate for Life Storage shareholders. Public Storage's proposal which was made during the quiet period before we announced our '22 results and outlook through 2024, does not account for our company's strong future growth prospects. Let me take a moment to explain the graph you see on Page 26. What we show here is the PEG ratio for us and our peers which is defined as the price-to-earnings ratio, divided by our earnings growth rate over a period of time. The PEG ratio calculates our 2024 FFO multiple, adjusted for the expected growth in 2024 and dividend yield. While Life Storage is undervalued on a 1-year FFO multiple basis, as we just discussed, it is even more undervalued when looking at our PEG ratio.When our FFO multiple is viewed in the context of our expected growth, we are trading well below our closest peers multiple. We anticipate a significant improvement in our multiple as the markets better understand the superior growth Life Storage is poised to deliver over the next 2 years. Let me repeat that. We anticipate a significant improvement in our multiple as the markets better understand the superior growth Life Storage is poised to deliver over the next 2 years. Public Storage's proposal fails to account for this industry-leading growth and instead seems to be opportunistically timed to transfer Life Storage's upside value to Public Storage. Now turning to Slide 27. The Board conducted a robust evaluation process. Among other things, the Board considered whether Life Storage is better positioned to deliver growth and value stand-alone or with Public Storage's proposals.The conclusion of this evaluation was unanimous. Life Storage is better positioned to continue enhancing value for shareholders by executing its current strategy than it would be through the proposed transaction. In reaching this conclusion, the Board considered a number of factors I reviewed today, our robust growth pipeline, our track record of delivering higher-than-expected total shareholder returns and driving leading revenue, NOI and FFO growth rates and our strong margin improvement. Further, the Board determined that our portfolio of newer, higher-quality assets in attractive markets is primed for growth that we do not believe public storage can match. The Board's evaluation indicated that the Public Storage proposal is inadequate, opportunistic and does not reflect Life Storage's best-in-class performance and value potential.I want to briefly mention in closing the independence of the Life Storage Board. This is a diverse, regularly refreshed board that is clearly committed to acting in shareholders' best interests. Board members bring significant experience and expertise relevant to our business objectives and are ultimately focused on value creation for shareholders. We are proud to have a strong record of engaging with shareholders and taking action in response to their feedback. Turning to the final slide. We believe Life Storage is uniquely valuable, growing at a faster rate in higher-growth properties than peers and delivering sector-leading margin improvement. Public Storage's proposal is opportunistically timed to take advantage of a temporary dislocation in the stock price and does not reflect Life Storage's recent performance and bright prospects for continued superior value creation.The Life Storage Board is open-minded and will continue to review opportunities to further enhance value as we execute on our proven plan to drive continued growth and shareholder value. Thank you all for joining us today. I hope you share in our excitement for the bright future we see ahead for Life Storage. As we turn to the Q&amp;A, I'd ask that you keep all questions focused on our strong performance, our business and the outlook we provided today. We shared quite a bit of detail around the Board's decision to reject the Public Storage's proposal and I'm sure you can appreciate that we do not intend to comment further on that matter.

The market shifts have investors worried that last year’s volatility is still with us, making for an unpredictable market environment. And it has those same investors looking for a way to cut through the data ‘noise’ and find the right stocks for an unsettled time.TipRanks’ Smart Score is just that, an intuitive data parsing tool based on an AI-powered algorithm that collects and collates the data on more than 8,000 publicly traded stocks – and then distills that data down to a single-digit score on a scale of 1 to 10. The score is based on 8 separate factors for each stock, and each factor is known to correlate with future share outperformance. A stock doesn’t need perfect scores on every factor to hit a ‘Perfect 10’ from the Smart Score, but that ‘Perfect 10’ will still tell investors that here is a stock worth a deeper look.We’ve gotten this ball rolling with a look into the TipRanks database, to find three stocks that earned the ‘Perfect 10’ Smart Score. All three of these stocks get top ratings from the Street, and show plenty of reasons for a bullish stance. Let’s take a closer look.NICE, Ltd. (NICE)First on our list is NICE, a software company working in the field of customer experience, offering a range of enterprise services through its cloud-based CXone platform. NICE’s services include improving customer experience and loyalty, reducing the cost of services while increasing sales, and regulatory compliance and fraud prevention. The company  counts some of the business world’s largest names among its customer base, including American Airlines, Farmers Insurance, and Radisson Hotels.Zooming out, NICE shows the signs of an upwardly mobile tech firm. In the company’s financials, both top line revenues and bottom line earnings have been showing a steady upward trend for the past several years. At the same time, NICE shares have underperformed the NASDAQ so far this year, gaining ~6% compared to the 9% increase on the index.Story continuesA look at the most recent financial report, released last week for 4Q22, shows one reason for the stutter. NICE did report a strong top line, with quarterly revenues up 10% year-over-year at $568.6 million. This include a 26% increase in cloud revenue, which made up $358.9 million of the total top line. In earnings, the company reported non-GAAP diluted EPS of $2.04 per share, up 18% y/y. For the full year, the revenue of $2.18 billion was up 13% from 2021.Looking ahead, however, investors expressed some worry about the forward guidance. The company  published 2023 revenue guidance in the range of $2.345 billion to $2.365 billion, while the Street had been expecting something closer to $2.41 billion. The shares are down 5% since the earnings release.The Smart Score on NICE, however, presents several reasons for optimism. The ‘Perfect 10’ is based on several factors, including 100% positive sentiment from the financial bloggers, and a positive trend on the crowd wisdom. News sentiment on NICE is also 100% positive recently. Most importantly, the hedge funds tracked by TipRanks increased their holdings in NICE by well over 815,000 shares last quarter.In his coverage of NICE for JMP, analyst Patrick Walravens sees several paths forward for the company, and outlines them in support of his bullish view: “We continue to view NICE as an excellent opportunity for long-term capital appreciation in a tough market for several reasons, including: 1) NICE has a leading cloud-based contact center solution, with growth driven by strong enterprise traction, international demand, and its AI capabilities; 2) we like the veteran leadership of CEO Barak Eilam and CFO Beth Gaspich, with the long-time support of Chairman David Kostman; 3) NICE sees its competitive positioning improving relative to other vendors in the space that are less financially sound…; and 4) the company still has in front of it a huge opportunity to convert its roughly $500M maintenance stream to the cloud which, at a 3x multiple, implies around a $1.5B opportunity.”Taken all together, these factors lead Walravens to rate this stock as Outperform (Buy), with a price target of $343 implying a one-year upside potential of 68%. (To watch Walravens’ track record, click here.)This leading tech firm has picked up 7 recent analyst reviews, and these include 6 to Buy against just 1 to Hold, for a Strong Buy consensus rating. The shares are priced at $203.99 and their $262.14 average price target suggests a gain of 28% on the one-year horizon. (See NICE’s stock forecast at TipRanks.)Public Storage (PSA)Next on our list is Public Storage, a firm organized as a real estate investment trust (REIT) but with its properties focused on self-storage facilities across the US. Public Storage derives its income from a combination of leases and management fees on the properties. With a market cap exceeding $50 billion and more than 2,900 locations in the US, Public Storage is the largest of the publicly traded self-storage REITs.The company released its earnings report for the fourth quarter and full year 2022 on February 21, and some important metrics beat the forecasts. The company’s revenues of $1.09 billion, while flat from Q3, were up 18% y/y and edged over the expectation of $1.08 billion. In a key metric that should interest income-minded investors, the company’s core funds from operations (FFO) was reported at $732 million, up 17.5% y/y; on a per share basis, this metric was $4.16, beating the forecast of $3.97 by a wide margin.The FFO is used to fund the company’s dividend, which was raised by 50% in the last declaration. The common share dividend, now at $3 per share, is scheduled for payout on March 30. At an annualized rate of $12, the dividend yields 4.1%. While not high enough to offset inflation, the dividend is approximately double the average yield found among S&amp;P-listed firms.On the Smart Score, PSA rates high on several metrics to support its Perfect 10. The news sentiment is 100% positive recently, while the financial bloggers are 85% positive. The crowd wisdom shows an upward trend, with individual investors increasing their holdings in the stock over the past 30 days. The hedges also have been buying in, adding 194,400 shares last quarter, and company insiders, who never trade their own shares lightly, have bought $23.1 million worth of PSA in the last three months.The bullish view on Public Storage is set out clearly by Stifel’s 5-star analyst Steve Manaker, who writes, “Although the business is normalizing and seasonality has returned, we believe the REIT remains well positioned to generate strong top and bottom-line growth through ECRI (existing customer rent increases) and stabilization of the non-same-store portfolio. 4Q’s numbers showed this….  While growth is decelerating, we continue to believe PSA will have strong results, with FFO increasing 7.3%/6.8% in 23/24 (based on our estimates). Our 2023 estimate is 1.7% above the high-end of guidance (we believe 2H23 operating results will be relatively strong given easier comps). PSA shares trade at a very attractive 4% discount to the REIT universe…”In-line with his stance, Manaker rates PSA shares as a Buy, and his price target, which he has placed at $360, indicates his confidence in a 23% gain over the next 12 months. (To watch Manaker’s track record, click here.)With 6 recent analyst reviews on record, including 5 to Buy against 1 to Hold, this stock has earned its Strong Buy consensus rating. Shares are trading for $293.24, and the average price target of $354.80 implies a 21% increase going out to the one-year time frame. (See Public Storage’s stock forecast at TipRanks.)Terns Pharmaceuticals (TERN)Last on our list is Terns Pharmaceuticals, a clinical-stage biopharma firm working on novel small-molecule compounds intended as therapies for a range of serious medical conditions, including non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), severe obesity, and chronic myeloid leukemia (CML). The company’s drug candidates are under investigation as both mono- and combination therapies, for conditions that have high unmet medical needs due to few existing effective treatment options.The company’s most advanced programs, both in the treatment of NASH, are for TERN-501. The drug candidate is undergoing a pair of human clinical trials, the Phase 2a DUET series. One trial is testing TERN-501, a THR-beta agonist, as a monotherapy for NASH; the other trial is testing TERN-501 in combination with TERN-101, making a THR-beta/FXR combo. The Phase 2a trials were initiated in May of last year, and top line data is expected for release in 2H23.Also in human trials is TERN-701, a drug candidate for the treatment of CML. The Phase 1 trail was initiated in 2Q22. The Phase 1 trial is being undertaken by the Chinese firm Hanosh, on license from Terns. Patient dosing in the trial is underway. A clinical trial in the US is planned for 2H23, with a potential data release next year.Finally, Terns is ready to move its drug candidate TERN-601 from preclinical to clinical testing, and is looking to initiate a Phase 1, first-in-human clinical trial of the compound in 2H23. TERN-601 is being developed as a treatment for severe obesity. If the Phase 1 trial is to begin on schedule, the company expects to have data available for release during 2024.In Terns’ Smart Score, we find that the two key metrics are hedge fund purchases, which totaled 1.7 million last quarter, and the insider buys, which reached $4.7 million in the last 3 months. In addition, the stock is showing a solid 213% positive momentum over the last 12 months.JMP analyst Silvan Tuerkcan is impressed by this biopharma’s ability to manage multiple shots on goal, and writes of TERN, “Terns marries development of chemically differentiated small-molecule therapeutics with validated MOAs (mechanism of action) with distinct commercial opportunities in large patient populations. We continue to see value with small-molecule development, especially when molecules with proven and derisked MOAs can be further improved. Additionally, designing fast-follower type assets substantially derisks the development pathway based on known endpoints and trial designs, and allows an early read on efficacy and safety through reference data sets… At the same time, TERN is innovating its molecules to address shortcomings of successful therapies.”Looking forward, Tuerkcan rates this stock as Outperform (a Buy) and sets a price target of $17, suggesting an upside potential of 62% for the year ahead. (To watch Tuerckan’s track record, click here.)This biopharmaceutical firm has attracted attention from 4 analysts recently, and their reviews include 3 to Buy and 1 to Hold – for a Strong Buy consensus rating. The stock is currently priced at $10.51 and its $14.25 average price target implies that it will gain 35% in the next 12 months.

119,b162d217-7bb4-3d82-bc47-6f59c203dc65,PLD,2023-02-27,7 Stocks That Hedge Funds Are Flooding Into. Should You?,InvestorPlace,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/7-stocks-hedge-funds-flooding-222221203.html,1677190941,STORY,"['PLD', 'MSFT', 'TSLA', 'AAPL', 'BRK-B', 'AMZN', 'SCHW']","[With so many vagaries clouding the present market environment, one possible avenue for success is to align your portfolio with your favorite hedge fund stocks. Simultaneously celebrated and vilified, this special brand of institutional investor might give you an edge. Primarily, your favorite hedge fund stocks typically stem from the top experts in the stock-picking game. And these institutions only hire the absolute best analysts and provide them with unparalleled technical resources. Sure, there’s a tendency to dismiss such experts as clowns. However, the reality is that more often than not, they know what they’re doing.Second, investors may find comfort in the safety of numbers. It’s one thing when one institutional investor places a heavy wager. It’s quite another when several of them make the same bet. Therefore, aligning with your favorite hedge fund stocks might improve your odds. Below are some of the most targeted plays – and whether you should get involved or not.MSFTMicrosoft$254.77AAPLApple$149.40AMZNAmazon$95.82BRK-ABerkshire Hathaway$459,375.00TSLATesla$202.07SCHWCharles Schwab$78.97PLDPrologis$124.01InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsMicrosoft (MSFT)The Microsoft logo outside a building representing MSFT stock.Source: Asif Islam / Shutterstock.comAccording to information provided by HedgeFollow.com, Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) ranked second place among favorite hedge fund stocks. Per the website, this category of institutional investor acquired a total of $58.99 billion worth of MSFT since the beginning of the first quarter of 2023. The top three investors are Norges Bank (buying $20.40 billion), Morgan Stanley ($3.46 billion), and BlackRock ($3.12 billion).Financially, Microsoft arguably represents a no-brainer among popular hedge fund stocks. Per Gurufocus.com’s proprietary calculations for fair market value, MSFT rates as modestly undervalued. On the balance sheet, the company features solid strengths, including an Altman Z-Score of 8.31 (reflecting a very low bankruptcy risk). As well, it features strong growth and outstanding profitability metrics.Story continuesPresently, Wall Street analysts peg MSFT as a consensus strong buy. Further, their average price target stands at $291.70, implying 16% upside potential. In the trailing year, MSFT slipped over 10% as the technology sector suffered badly in 2022. However, since the January opener, MSFT gained 5%.Apple (AAPL)Apple store. Apple Inc. (AAPL) sells consumer electronics, computer software, services and personal computers.Source: Vytautas Kielaitis / Shutterstock.comA stalwart in the consumer tech space, Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) ranks third among favorite hedge fund stocks per HedgeFollow.com. According to the website, these institutional investors acquired a total of $55.48 billion worth of AAPL stock. The top investor so far in Q1 2023 is Norges Bank at $22.44 billion. Coming in second and third were Morgan Stanley ($3.84 billion) and Barclays ($1.57 billion).On paper, Apple should be reeling from the pressures impacting the consumer economy. However, its brand remains as powerful as ever. Currently, Gurufocus.com labels AAPL as modestly undervalued based on its proprietary FMV calculations. Not surprisingly, though, the greatest strengths center on its operational dominance.For instance, Apple’s three-year revenue growth rate stands at 20%, outpacing 85.62% of its competitors. Its net margin pings at 24.56%, beating out 95.52% of rivals. Right now, Wall Street analysts peg AAPL as a consensus strong buy. Further, their average price target stands at $171.94, implying over 15% upside potential.Amazon (AMZN)Closeup of the Amazon logo at Amazon campus in Palo Alto, California. The Palo Alto location hosts A9 Search, Amazon Web Services, and Amazon Game Studios teams. AMZN stockSource: Tada Images / Shutterstock.comEarning its reputation in the e-commerce space, Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) ranks among the favorite hedge fund stocks for its massive footprint. Per HedgeFollow.com, the company comes in fourth place among buy-ins from these institutional investors, which bought $41.62 billion worth. Again, the top investor was Norges Bank, in this case with an exposure of $9.69 billion. Morgan Stanley and JPMorgan Chase rounded out the top three at $2.04 billion and $1.38 billion, respectively.To be fair, Amazon represents a tricky narrative because of the beating it took in 2022. In the trailing year, shares gave up nearly 34% of equity value. As well, Gurufocus.com warns that AMZN may be a possible value trap. Finally, in the past year, the net margin slipped slightly into negative territory.On the other hand, Amazon still represents a growth machine. Its three-year revenue growth rate stands at 21.9%, beating out 84.28% of its rivals. Combined with its brand power and myriad relevancies, it should be worth a look. Presently, covering analysts peg AMZN as a consensus strong buy. Their average price target stands at $137.05, implying 43% upside potential.Berkshire Hathaway (BRK-A)The logo for Berkshire Hathaway displayed on a smartphone screen.Source: IgorGolovniov / Shutterstock.comWhen it comes to discussing Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRK-A), presumably most publications focus on its Class B shares. Regarding popular hedge fund stocks, however, we’re going to be talking about Class A shares – the one where a single share costs more than the average U.S. home.Ranking fifth, hedge funds acquired $29.96 billion worth of BRK-A. The top investor was Perigon Wealth Management at $15.51 billion. Next came CI Private Wealth at $6.81 billion and Norges Bank at $2.58 billion. Financially, Gurufocus.com warns its readers that BRK.A may be modestly overvalued. That said, the industrial conglomerate attracts attention because of its wide-reaching wagers.Plus, it features solid operations. Most notably, its three-year revenue growth rate stands at 19.7%, outpacing 81.3% of its peers. Also, its book growth rate during the same period is 17.3%, beating out 84.3% of the industry. Turning to Wall Street, covering analysts peg BRK-A as a consensus moderate buy. Further, their average price target stands at $542,568, implying nearly 18% upside potential.Tesla (TSLA)Tesla (TSLA stock) Motors store in Piazza Gae Aulenti square in Milan, ItalySource: Zigres / Shutterstock.comAs things stand now, Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) ranks as the top idea among popular hedge fund stocks. These institutional investors bought $60.36 billion worth of TSLA. Further, the top hedge fund was Natixis, buying up $32.35% billion worth of shares. Rounding out the top three were Norges Bank ($5.31 billion) and Susquehanna International Group ($2.17 billion). So, why didn’t I mention Tesla as the top name among popular hedge fund stocks? Mainly, it’s not clear that everyone should acquire TSLA. It really depends on your risk-reward profile.Objectively, TSLA appears significantly overvalued. At the time of writing, the market prices TSLA at a trailing multiple of 55.44. Also, TSLA trades at a forward multiple of 50.14. Both are overwhelmingly overvalued for the underlying industry. Adding to the pressures, electric vehicles tend to be quite expensive at this juncture. Further, not everyone has access to home charging. Here’s the other thing. Although covering analysts peg TSLA as a consensus moderate buy, their average price target pings at $202.46. That’s less than 1% upside potential. If you believe in it, go for it. However, it might not be for everyone.Charles Schwab (SCHW)man's hand holding wads of cashSource: Vova Shevchuk / Shutterstock.comAnother example of popular hedge fund stock that might not be everyone’s cup of tea is Charles Schwab (NYSE:SCHW). Coming in sixth place, hedge funds acquired $23.93 billion worth of the financial services firm. The top investor was Toronto Dominion Bank at $17.47 billion. The second place belongs to Norges Bank ($1.23 billion) and third to Morgan Stanley ($664.26 million).Overall, SCHW isn’t a bad bet. However, it features confusing fundamentals. On the optimistic front, bear market cycles tend to let the cream rise to the top regarding wealth management businesses. I’ve mentioned this concept several times before. However, it does come with the risk that during down cycles, people tend not to invest. Further, the Federal Reserve poses serious problems. Theoretically, higher interest rates mean greater profitability for financial packages. But it also means fewer incentives to take those packages because of higher borrowing costs. On the Street, analysts peg SCHW as a consensus moderate buy. Further, their average price target stands at $91.05, implying nearly 14% upside potential.Prologis (PLD)hands at desk near laptop computer, with one hand holding a pile of hundred dollar billsSource: shutterstock.com/CC7A real estate investment trust (REIT), Prologis (NYSE:PLD) invests in logistics facilities. Per HedgeFollow.com, Prologis ranks as number 11 among popular hedge fund stocks. Collectively, these institutional investors acquired $18.07 billion worth of PLD stock. Acquiring the most was Vanguard Group at $2.59 billion. Rounding out the top three were BlackRock at $1.72 billion and Cohen &amp; Steers at $1.43 billion.In any other circumstance, Prologis might be a no-brainer acquisition. And for those that believe in the broader post-pandemic economic recovery, it might still be. However, PLD might not be the most appropriate investor for everyone’s needs.Setting aside that it appears objectively overvalued at this juncture, Prologis faces concerns associated with the consumer economy. Should the Fed get too aggressive in its bid to control inflation, the logistics facilities business might suffer. So far, though, Wall Street remains optimistic. Presently, covering analysts peg PLD as a consensus strong buy. Also, their average price target stands at $138.71, implying nearly 13% upside potential.On the date of publication, Josh Enomoto did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.A former senior business analyst for Sony Electronics, Josh Enomoto has helped broker major contracts with Fortune Global 500 companies.

But the reality is that when a company loses money each year, for long enough, its investors will usually take their share of those losses. While a well funded company may sustain losses for years, it will need to generate a profit eventually, or else investors will move on and the company will wither away.So if this idea of high risk and high reward doesn't suit, you might be more interested in profitable, growing companies, like Robert Half International (NYSE:RHI).

121,9ed7498c-3eb9-32cc-940f-c5c419d98b5c,PPL,2023-02-27,Analysis-Some highly rated US companies take unusual funding route as rates rise,Reuters,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/analysis-highly-rated-us-companies-061502902.html,1677478502,STORY,['PPL'],"[By Shankar Ramakrishnan(Reuters) -Some highly rated U.S. companies have issued bonds that convert to shares to raise several billion dollars so far this year, in what bankers said signals a shift in a market that has long been dominated by companies with few other options to raise money.Investment-grade-rated companies have traditionally avoided such convertible securities because they risk giving away shares at a discount to the market price, lowering the value of their stock. Credit-worthy companies have found in the past that they can raise funds more cheaply in investment-grade bond markets.But in the past week alone, two highly rated utility companies -- PPL Corp and Southern Co -- raised a total of $2.4 billion through convertible bonds, making them the first investment-grade utilities in 20 years to do so. They were able to issue the securities at much lower interest rates than what they would have had to pay on a bond.So far this year, investment-grade companies have helped boost convertible bond issuance volumes to $8.5 billion, putting the market on pace to reach $65 billion to $70 billion this year, or more than double the amount raised in 2022 and returning to the levels of previous years, one banker said.Craig McCracken, co-head of equity capital markets at Wells Fargo, said more investment-grade companies were showing interest, promising to make 2023 ""a breakout year relative to 2022"" for convertible bond issuance.CHEAP FINANCINGThe entry of some investment-grade companies in the convertible bond market shows how the U.S. Federal Reserve’s rapid interest rate hikes to stamp out inflation have created anomalies in the marketplace. In recent weeks, economic resilience in the face of the Fed’s campaign has added to uncertainty about the path of the stock market and interest rates in the coming months.In interviews, two bankers and an investor said that uncertainty has made convertible bonds an attractive option to raise money for some investment-grade companies. That is supported by an accounting rule change last year that made it less expensive for companies to issue convertible bonds and by steady demand from funds dedicated to investing in these securities, they said.Story continues""Convertibles are the cheapest available financing for both high-yield and high-grade issuers right now,"" said Josh Schaeffer, managing director at accounting firm Equity Methods.HYBRID SECURITIESConvertible bonds are hybrid securities. Like a regular bond, they pay a coupon and their yields change with interest rates. But their value also depends on the company's stock price, as they can convert to shares. The hybrid nature can limit the risk but also add to it.Earlier this week, for example, investors bought PPL’s convertible bond at 100 cents on the dollar, or at par. The bond was trading at 101 cents on Friday.Investors were betting on an appreciation in the shares of the company, according to Howard Needle, portfolio manager at Wellesley Asset Management, which bought the bond.PPL’s stock is up 19% from a low of $23.28 in October last year.Because defensive stocks such as utilities like PPL could benefit if interest rates keep rising, potential returns for investors in convertible bonds could be boosted. That environment would make convertible bonds attractive to such companies because it would instill confidence that their offerings would successfully raise money.On the flip side, investment-grade companies in other sectors whose stock prices suffer when rates rise would likely shy away from the convertible bond market because their product would be less attractive to investors.For PPL, these factors have meant it was able to raise $900 million through a five-year convertible bond that paid a 2.875% coupon. Southern's 2.75-year bonds pay 3.875%. Both are much lower than the average investment-grade corporate bond yield of 5.48%.Wells Fargo's McCracken said that in addition to the lure of cost savings, convertibles have become more palatable to higher-rated companies because of an accounting change in 2022.A U.S. accounting rule had required that companies issuing convertibles add in a hypothetical interest expense on the bond, adding to the cost of issuance. That rule was eliminated last year.(Reporting by Shankar Ramakrishnan; editing by Paritosh Bansal and Leslie Adler)]"

(NYSE:WM) sold US$5.2m worth of stock, possibly indicating weakness in the future",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/insiders-waste-management-inc-nyse-120035704.html,1677499235,STORY,['WM'],"[In the last year, many Waste Management, Inc. (NYSE:WM) insiders sold a substantial stake in the company which may have sparked shareholders' attention. Knowing whether insiders are buying is usually more helpful when evaluating insider transactions, as insider selling can have various explanations. However, when multiple insiders sell stock over a specific duration, shareholders should take notice as that could possibly be a red flag.While insider transactions are not the most important thing when it comes to long-term investing, we do think it is perfectly logical to keep tabs on what insiders are doing. See our latest analysis for Waste Management The Last 12 Months Of Insider Transactions At Waste ManagementOver the last year, we can see that the biggest insider sale was by the Executive VP &amp; COO, John Morris, for US$3.4m worth of shares, at about US$168 per share. While we don't usually like to see insider selling, it's more concerning if the sales take place at a lower price. It's of some comfort that this sale was conducted at a price well above the current share price, which is US$151. So it may not shed much light on insider confidence at current levels.Waste Management insiders didn't buy any shares over the last year. You can see the insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last year depicted in the chart below. If you click on the chart, you can see all the individual transactions, including the share price, individual, and the date!insider-trading-volumeFor those who like to find winning investments this free list of growing companies with recent insider purchasing, could be just the ticket.Does Waste Management Boast High Insider Ownership?I like to look at how many shares insiders own in a company, to help inform my view of how aligned they are with insiders. I reckon it's a good sign if insiders own a significant number of shares in the company. Waste Management insiders own 0.2% of the company, currently worth about US$120m based on the recent share price. Most shareholders would be happy to see this sort of insider ownership, since it suggests that management incentives are well aligned with other shareholders.Story continuesSo What Do The Waste Management Insider Transactions Indicate?There haven't been any insider transactions in the last three months -- that doesn't mean much. It's great to see high levels of insider ownership, but looking back over the last year, we don't gain confidence from the Waste Management insiders selling. While we like knowing what's going on with the insider's ownership and transactions, we make sure to also consider what risks are facing a stock before making any investment decision. Every company has risks, and we've spotted 1 warning sign for Waste Management you should know about.Of course, you might find a fantastic investment by looking elsewhere. So take a peek at this free list of interesting companies.For the purposes of this article, insiders are those individuals who report their transactions to the relevant regulatory body.

(SoCalGas) today announced $10 million in shareholder funding to help customers with bill assistance and to bolster community resources for those who may be struggling financially.The company committed $5 million in shareholder funding to the Gas Assistance Fund, a program administered by the United Way that provides income-qualified customers with one-time grants to help pay their natural gas bills. The contribution is the largest in the fund's 40-year history and will help the United Way expand access to the program to thousands of additional Southern Californians this winter.SoCalGas also announced it will contribute $4 million from its donor advised fund to relaunch its popular Fueling Our Communities program, a collaboration with local food banks and nonprofits that has provided free meals and groceries to thousands of Californians facing food insecurity since 2020.In addition, SoCalGas will contribute $1 million in aid from its donor advised fund to small restaurant owners through the Restaurants Care Resilience Fund, a fund that was started in 2021 to help small restaurants with improvements, upgrades, employee retention and to manage debt, losses and rising costs.""This winter's unprecedented natural gas prices, on top of already high inflation, have been a real hardship for many Southern Californians, especially our most vulnerable, our seniors, and people facing difficult circumstances,"" said SoCalGas CEO, Scott Drury. ""Thanks to the incredible work of the United Way, and the network of tireless, nonprofit leaders who support our work in the community, we will be able to help many more of our neighbors, families, and small businesses in cities and towns across Southern California this winter.""Story continues""These contributions will provide much-needed relief for some of our most vulnerable residents at a time when cold temperatures make it harder to turn down the heat,"" said Los Angeles County Supervisor Kathryn Barger. ""As we learn more about the West Coast market conditions that led to unusually high bills, proactive partnerships like this one are addressing the immediate very real needs of our community. I continue looking forward to what soon may be a return to more normal natural gas prices.""EXPANDED ACCESS TO GAS ASSISTANCE FUNDSoCalGas's latest contribution to the Gas Assistance Fund will help the United Way expand income eligibility for the program and increase the grant amount available to each qualified customer from $100 to up to $400 for the remainder of the 2023 program. Additionally, income-eligible older adults (55+) and those facing certain financial hardships may be eligible for extra grant funding.""Over the last four decades, the Gas Assistance Fund has helped hundreds of thousands of vulnerable Californians who face difficult choices during cold months between staying warm and other basic necessities like food and medicine,"" said Elise Buik, president &amp; CEO at United Way of Greater Los Angeles. ""This historic contribution will help the United Way dramatically expand our reach and allow thousands of individuals, older adults, and families across our region to remain healthy and housed this winter.""FUELING OUR COMMUNITIES - 2023The Fueling our Communities Program began in 2020 as a collaboration between SoCalGas and five regional nonprofits to provide free meals to individuals impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. During the program's first summer, SoCalGas and its partners provided more than 140,000 meals to 40,000 individuals from underserved communities across Southern California. With its latest $4 million contribution, SoCalGas aims to significantly expand the Fueling our Communities program via new and existing partnerships with food banks and nonprofits with a focus on serving families and seniors in need.SUPPORTING SMALL BUSINESSESThe Restaurants Care Resilience Fund was started in 2021 to help small restaurants with improvements, upgrades, employee retention and to manage debt, losses and rising costs. SoCalGas has supported the fund since its inception.""What started as a lifeline to restaurants during the pandemic has grown into a robust fund to assist small restaurants with grants to strengthen their businesses and invest in their people,"" said Alycia Harshfield, executive director of the California Restaurant Foundation. ""SoCalGas' incredible generosity, commitment, and leadership has a lasting positive ripple effect, and we are proud to partner with them again to make such a meaningful impact.""MARKET CONDITIONS IMPROVEAfter a significant drop in February from January's unprecedented natural gas commodity prices, market prices for March 2023 usage are currently forecasted to be significantly lower than February's prices. In addition, the restoration of service to an out-of-state pipeline, which has been offline for two years, is expected to increase supply capacity to the Southwest. Consistent with regulatory requirements, SoCalGas will file March core procurement prices (rates) with the California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC) at the end of February.The core procurement rate reflects the price SoCalGas pays for natural gas for residential and business customers. That rate changes each month. SoCalGas does not set the price for natural gas. Instead, natural gas prices are determined by national and regional markets. SoCalGas buys natural gas in those markets on behalf of residential and small business customers, and the cost of buying that gas is billed to those customers with no markup.WHAT CAUSED PRICES TO SPIKE IN JANUARY?According to the US Energy Information Administration (EIA), a number of factors have contributed to higher natural gas commodity prices:Widespread, below-normal temperatures on much of the West Coast, including Washington and Oregon;High natural gas demand for heating by customers in areas with below normal temperatures;Reduced natural gas supplies to the West Coast from Canada and the Rocky Mountains;Reduced interstate pipeline capacity to the West Coast because of pipeline maintenance activities in West Texas (the out of state pipeline mentioned earlier in this news release); andLow natural gas storage levels on the West Coast.According to the EIA, the U.S. set a natural gas consumption daily record on Dec. 23, 2022, further exacerbating supply and demand challenges.Several experts discussed these market conditions at a California Public Utilities Commission public hearing earlier this month. Video of that proceeding is available here.IS ADDITIONAL HELP AVAILABLE? In light of unprecedented market conditions, the California Public Utilities Commission voted earlier this month to accelerate the California Climate Credit. As a result, SoCalGas customers will receive a credit of $50.77 in their February or March bill, depending on their billing cycle.In addition, SoCalGas continues to encourage customers to take advantage of programs and services that can help manage usage and save costs.Eligible customers may sign up for a Level Pay Plan (LPP), for example, which averages their annual natural gas use and costs over 12 months. There are also financial assistance programs for eligible customers who are experiencing hardships.SoCalGas' free Ways to Save tool may also help customers with energy savings options through a personalized savings plan that offers a household energy analysis, customized energy-efficiency recommendations, bill comparisons, and energy usage comparisons that could help save on natural gas bills. Customers can also sign up for weekly Bill Tracker Alerts to monitor natural gas consumption, take steps to reduce usage, and avoid bill surprises.Customers can visit socalgas.com/ManageHigherBills for more information on the factors that lead to higher bills and ways we can help.About SoCalGasHeadquartered in Los Angeles, SoCalGas® is the largest gas distribution utility in the United States.

With surging gas prices, can California restaurants stay afloat? (Myung J. Chun/Los Angeles Times)The key to Vietnamese restaurant Pho 87’s signature soup — 16 to 20 hours of simmering on the stove — proved catastrophic this month. When owner Tre Dinh opened his gas bill for January, it was more than $8,000.In December the Chinatown restaurant’s gas bill was roughly $800 for November usage, according to Dinh. The bill he received in January leapt to around $2,000, but even knowing another price increase was coming didn’t prepare the restaurant owner for the bill he received in February. He’s one of countless restaurateurs who received a sky-high January gas bill, credited largely to the wholesale cost of natural gas hitting record highs.The ripple effect is being felt through the homes and businesses of Southern California Gas Co.'s 21.8 million customers, with Pacific Gas &amp; Electric also estimating high gas bills for Central and Northern California this winter. Businesses that require gas cooking methods — such as tabletop Korean barbecues, wok stations, and gas-powered stoves and ovens — are now costing restaurateurs thousands of dollars more than their typical expenses, causing some owners to consider closing temporarily or raising prices to offset the charges. Adding to existing concerns over inflation, supply-chain difficulties and labor costs, some feel helpless.“It just doesn’t end,” said Paul Cao, the chef-owner of Irvine restaurant Burnt Crumbs. “When are we going to get relief?”Dinh is planning to take action.“I'm writing a petition or something. I want to fight the city, fight the gas company, because this is impossible.” he said. “I'm not just worried about us. I'm worried about the whole community.”Dinh, whose parents opened the pho shop in 1987 and who took over in 2018, is calling on aid for businesses struggling with their gas bills. In a bid to help other restaurants in Chinatown, Dinh has changed his years-long practice of eating in his own restaurant multiple times a day and patronizing other spots in the neighborhood two or three times a week; recently he’s begun eating one meal at Pho 87 and one meal at a nearby restaurant each day. As he’s made his way through multiple restaurants, he hears the same: Everyone has been hit by these gas prices, and all need support.Story continuesPho 87 serves a range of pho, including its popular charred-pork variety, with broths simmering for a minimum of 16 hours. To offset the latest gas bill, ownership is expecting to raise its prices by at least $1. (Stephanie Breijo / Los Angeles Times)“If you go out and eat — even spend like $3 on a sandwich or something — it just gives everybody hope that their community is there to back them up,” he said.Should gas prices remain comparable or increase again, Dinh is considering closing the restaurant for a month in the spring. A cold-weather staple, the pho shop typically sees a decline in business as the weather warms up; L.A.’s current cold snap is keeping the restaurant busier than average for February, but March and April often mark the shop’s annual slow period. Another $8,000 gas bill would not be worth the operating costs, Dinh said. It would also be a choice that makes a statement.“We have to stand up for ourselves and what we believe in,” Dinh said. “If we keep opening and paying, they won't feel like it's affecting anyone. We can keep it open, but we won't be making any money. They will be making money.” Should he close for a month, however, he’ll hurt his employees’ paychecks; he’s being put in a difficult situation, he said.SoCalGas has stated that the company does not profit from rising natural gas costs.Fortunately for Dinh, February’s prices are set to decrease and the bill he receives in early March should be more manageable, according to Southern California Gas Co. February prices per therm should drop 68% from January — still up from what customers paid in December 2022 and still higher than usual for February, historically, according to one SoCalGas executive, but a decline from last month’s dramatic jump in cost.Regardless of whether he’ll temporarily shutter the restaurant, Dinh knows he has to raise prices. Surrounded by notes, signed jerseys and sketches from his customers, he says he is just as concerned for Pho 87’s fans as he is for the local restaurant community. Passing costs on to guests is a difficult choice for the owner to make; he knows they’re all receiving high gas bills at home, too. Traditionally his family raises prices by 25 cents each year; given Pho 87’s latest gas bill, he concedes he’ll have to raise them $1 to $1.50 for entrees, and he just hopes that his customers will understand.Tre Dinh, owner of Pho 87, grew up in his parents' restaurant before taking over in 2018. (Stephanie Breijo / Los Angeles Times)Three blocks away Chinese restaurant Hop Woo is struggling with an even larger gas bill.On Feb. 9 the Liang family behind the long-running barbecue specialist opened their gas bill and saw a shocking figure: $13,656.25. The therm rate had jumped from a cost of $1.05 per unit in December to a whopping $3.45 in January, sending the owners of the restaurant — which relies on gas stoves for its wok-fired menu and oven-roasted barbecued meats — into a panic.“I was just in shock,” said Mary Liang. “I had to do a double take.”At first they thought it was an error; maybe someone had forgotten to pay a previous month’s bill, resulting in past-due amounts tacked on to their current statement. This wasn’t the case, and the massive financial setback compounded years of difficulties that not only included pandemic-spurred rent backlogs, which the family is still paying off, but also the death of their patriarch and the chef-founder.Liang’s parents founded Hop Woo in 1993. After the 2022 death of chef Yening “Lupe” Liang — famed for instating an innovative trilingual menu at the restaurant — the restaurant has been run primarily by matriarch and co-founder Judy Liang with help from her daughter, niece and other family members. The setbacks have felt relentless.Mary Liang said the restaurant’s previous bills cost roughly $5,000 to $6,000 per month. They’ve been told that their next bill should be much lower, but that doesn’t provide much peace of mind. “It’s very uncertain because it can go up any time,” she said. “So even if it's lower for this next month, we never know if it's gonna go up again in the future.”Should another bill of that amount arrive, Liang says the cost of operating would be unsustainable. For now, the family has arranged a payment plan with SoCalGas to pay the amount due over the course of four months; after KCRW “Good Food” host Evan Kleiman shared a photo of Hop Woo’s bill on Instagram, Liang says contributions began trickling in through the restaurant’s COVID-era GoFundMe page. Liang says they’ve raised roughly $2,000 toward their gas bill and that every bit helps, including a simple takeout order.Hop Woo, in Chinatown, received a gas bill for $13,656.25. The family is raising funds to offset the high cost via a GoFundMe page. (Genaro Molina/Los Angeles Times)The high January gas bills extend far beyond Los Angeles.Paul Cao, executive chef-owner of Burnt Crumbs in Irvine, said he had steeled himself for a cost bump after he heard about the impending gas prices. In December his restaurant’s gas bill was about $700 — relatively on average. In January, it increased to roughly $1,000. When he opened his bill in February, the amount had spiked to $1,626.Like the Liangs, Cao said his enormous gas bill is piggybacking on nonstop hits his restaurant has endured: After years of operating during the pandemic, he had to contend with high labor costs because of a worker shortage. Supply chain issues and high food prices came next. Then egg prices skyrocketed.Before COVID-19 he owned three bricks-and-mortar restaurants. Now it’s just Burnt Crumbs — a popular brunch spot known for gourmet sandwiches — and his two food trucks. Like Dinh, he’s had to pass some of those costs on to consumers: Before the pandemic his sandwiches cost about $10. Now they run $12.50 to $13. He doesn’t know what he’ll do if gas prices keep climbing.“We can’t be selling $25 sandwiches,” Cao said. Unlike corporate-owned restaurants, Cao and other proprietors say smaller restaurants like theirs don’t have the flexibility to weather such dramatic changes. “If they keep increasing gas prices by 60% every month, we are not going to last,” Cao said.For those who rely on gas for pizza ovens, the cost is especially unavoidable.The gas bills soared by an average of $400 at Terrace by Mix Mix, where chef-owner Ross Pangilinan serves seasonal pizzas and hearth-fired shareable plates within Costa Mesa’s South Coast Plaza. Pangilinan also owns ReMix Kitchen Bar in Long Beach and is an owner of Populaire — a modern Cal-French bistro also in South Coast Plaza — but said the gas bill particularly spiked at Terrace because of the kitchen’s gas-powered pizza oven.“I’m not going to stop making pizzas,” he said. “We’re just going to have to look at our menu and see where we can increase prices while still giving value.”Gas costs more than doubled — from $700 to $1,800 a month — at Breezy in San Juan Capistrano, but raising menu prices right now isn’t an option for Jasmin Gonzalez, co-owner of the Pacific Islander-inspired brunch spot. Her restaurant only just opened in November, and it would be “detrimental” at this point, she said.“I can’t do that to our customers. When you gain the trust of customers in your community, as soon as you change something, it will mess it up,” Gonzalez said. “Right now, I’m just going to have to eat it.”Gonzalez, also co-owner of Primal Cut in Stanton, said she’s curious to see what next month’s gas bill will look like. If the gas bills continue at this pace, she said she’ll eventually have to raise prices in the summer.“I really won’t have a choice,” she said. “At some point something has to give.”This story originally appeared in Los Angeles Times.]"

We will use the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model on this occasion. There's really not all that much to it, even though it might appear quite complex.We would caution that there are many ways of valuing a company and, like the DCF, each technique has advantages and disadvantages in certain scenarios. If you still have some burning questions about this type of valuation, take a look at the Simply Wall St analysis model. Check out our latest analysis for UnitedHealth Group Step By Step Through The CalculationWe use what is known as a 2-stage model, which simply means we have two different periods of growth rates for the company's cash flows. Generally the first stage is higher growth, and the second stage is a lower growth phase. In the first stage we need to estimate the cash flows to the business over the next ten years. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.A DCF is all about the idea that a dollar in the future is less valuable than a dollar today, so we discount the value of these future cash flows to their estimated value in today's dollars:Story continues10-year free cash flow (FCF) estimate2023202420252026202720282029203020312032 Levered FCF ($, Millions) US$24.9bUS$26.4bUS$28.2bUS$31.5bUS$34.7bUS$37.1bUS$39.1bUS$40.8bUS$42.4bUS$43.7bGrowth Rate Estimate SourceAnalyst x4Analyst x4Analyst x2Analyst x2Analyst x2Est @ 6.88%Est @ 5.44%Est @ 4.43%Est @ 3.72%Est @ 3.23% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 6.8% US$23.3kUS$23.1kUS$23.1kUS$24.2kUS$24.9kUS$25.0kUS$24.6kUS$24.1kUS$23.4kUS$22.6k(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$238bAfter calculating the present value of future cash flows in the initial 10-year period, we need to calculate the Terminal Value, which accounts for all future cash flows beyond the first stage. The Gordon Growth formula is used to calculate Terminal Value at a future annual growth rate equal to the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield of 2.1%. We discount the terminal cash flows to today's value at a cost of equity of 6.8%.Terminal Value (TV)= FCF2032 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$44b× (1 + 2.1%) ÷ (6.8%– 2.1%) = US$939bPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$939b÷ ( 1 + 6.8%)10= US$485bThe total value is the sum of cash flows for the next ten years plus the discounted terminal value, which results in the Total Equity Value, which in this case is US$724b. The last step is to then divide the equity value by the number of shares outstanding. Relative to the current share price of US$484, the company appears quite undervalued at a 37% discount to where the stock price trades currently. Remember though, that this is just an approximate valuation, and like any complex formula - garbage in, garbage out.dcfThe AssumptionsNow the most important inputs to a discounted cash flow are the discount rate, and of course, the actual cash flows. If you don't agree with these result, have a go at the calculation yourself and play with the assumptions. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at UnitedHealth Group as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 6.8%, which is based on a levered beta of 0.800. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.SWOT Analysis for UnitedHealth GroupStrengthEarnings growth over the past year exceeded the industry.Debt is not viewed as a risk.Dividends are covered by earnings and cash flows.WeaknessDividend is low compared to the top 25% of dividend payers in the Healthcare market.OpportunityAnnual revenue is forecast to grow faster than the American market.Good value based on P/E ratio and estimated fair value.ThreatAnnual earnings are forecast to grow slower than the American market.Looking Ahead:Although the valuation of a company is important, it ideally won't be the sole piece of analysis you scrutinize for a company.

For example, changes in the company's cost of equity or the risk free rate can significantly impact the valuation. What is the reason for the share price sitting below the intrinsic value?

Horton (NYSE:DHI) sheds 3.4% this week, as yearly returns fall more in line with earnings growth",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/d-r-horton-nyse-dhi-132719259.html,1677418039,STORY,['DHI'],"[When you buy shares in a company, it's worth keeping in mind the possibility that it could fail, and you could lose your money. But when you pick a company that is really flourishing, you can make more than 100%. For example, the D.R. Horton, Inc. (NYSE:DHI) share price has soared 117% in the last half decade. Most would be very happy with that. The last week saw the share price soften some 3.4%.Although D.R. Horton has shed US$1.1b from its market cap this week, let's take a look at its longer term fundamental trends and see if they've driven returns. Check out our latest analysis for D.R. Horton To paraphrase Benjamin Graham: Over the short term the market is a voting machine, but over the long term it's a weighing machine. One flawed but reasonable way to assess how sentiment around a company has changed is to compare the earnings per share (EPS) with the share price.During five years of share price growth, D.R. Horton achieved compound earnings per share (EPS) growth of 43% per year. The EPS growth is more impressive than the yearly share price gain of 17% over the same period. So one could conclude that the broader market has become more cautious towards the stock. This cautious sentiment is reflected in its (fairly low) P/E ratio of 5.52.The image below shows how EPS has tracked over time (if you click on the image you can see greater detail).earnings-per-share-growthIt is of course excellent to see how D.R. Horton has grown profits over the years, but the future is more important for shareholders. It might be well worthwhile taking a look at our free report on how its financial position has changed over time.What About Dividends?When looking at investment returns, it is important to consider the difference between total shareholder return (TSR) and share price return. Whereas the share price return only reflects the change in the share price, the TSR includes the value of dividends (assuming they were reinvested) and the benefit of any discounted capital raising or spin-off. It's fair to say that the TSR gives a more complete picture for stocks that pay a dividend. As it happens, D.R. Horton's TSR for the last 5 years was 130%, which exceeds the share price return mentioned earlier. This is largely a result of its dividend payments!Story continuesA Different PerspectiveIt's good to see that D.R. Horton has rewarded shareholders with a total shareholder return of 7.2% in the last twelve months. Of course, that includes the dividend. Having said that, the five-year TSR of 18% a year, is even better. Potential buyers might understandably feel they've missed the opportunity, but it's always possible business is still firing on all cylinders. It's always interesting to track share price performance over the longer term. But to understand D.R. Horton better, we need to consider many other factors. Take risks, for example - D.R. Horton has   1 warning sign   we think you should be aware of.But note: D.R. Horton may not be the best stock to buy.

136,134a52cd-fcd3-349d-9f88-c2acb169522b,ETN,2023-02-27,We Wouldn't Be Too Quick To Buy Eaton Corporation plc (NYSE:ETN) Before It Goes Ex-Dividend,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/wouldnt-too-quick-buy-eaton-100644221.html,1677492404,STORY,['ETN'],"[Some investors rely on dividends for growing their wealth, and if you're one of those dividend sleuths, you might be intrigued to know that Eaton Corporation plc (NYSE:ETN) is about to go ex-dividend in just three days. Typically, the ex-dividend date is one business day before the record date which is the date on which a company determines the shareholders eligible to receive a dividend. It is important to be aware of the ex-dividend date because any trade on the stock needs to have been settled on or before the record date. Meaning, you will need to purchase Eaton's shares before the 3rd of March to receive the dividend, which will be paid on the 24th of March.The company's upcoming dividend is US$0.86 a share, following on from the last 12 months, when the company distributed a total of US$3.24 per share to shareholders. Last year's total dividend payments show that Eaton has a trailing yield of 2.0% on the current share price of $173.25. Dividends are an important source of income to many shareholders, but the health of the business is crucial to maintaining those dividends. That's why we should always check whether the dividend payments appear sustainable, and if the company is growing. See our latest analysis for Eaton Dividends are typically paid out of company income, so if a company pays out more than it earned, its dividend is usually at a higher risk of being cut. Eaton paid out 52% of its earnings to investors last year, a normal payout level for most businesses. That said, even highly profitable companies sometimes might not generate enough cash to pay the dividend, which is why we should always check if the dividend is covered by cash flow. Dividends consumed 67% of the company's free cash flow last year, which is within a normal range for most dividend-paying organisations.It's positive to see that Eaton's dividend is covered by both profits and cash flow, since this is generally a sign that the dividend is sustainable, and a lower payout ratio usually suggests a greater margin of safety before the dividend gets cut.Story continuesClick here to see the company's payout ratio, plus analyst estimates of its future dividends.historic-dividendHave Earnings And Dividends Been Growing?Stocks with flat earnings can still be attractive dividend payers, but it is important to be more conservative with your approach and demand a greater margin for safety when it comes to dividend sustainability. Investors love dividends, so if earnings fall and the dividend is reduced, expect a stock to be sold off heavily at the same time. It's not encouraging to see that Eaton's earnings are effectively flat over the past five years. Better than seeing them fall off a cliff, for sure, but the best dividend stocks grow their earnings meaningfully over the long run.Many investors will assess a company's dividend performance by evaluating how much the dividend payments have changed over time. In the past 10 years, Eaton has increased its dividend at approximately 8.5% a year on average.The Bottom LineShould investors buy Eaton for the upcoming dividend? Eaton has been unable to generate earnings growth, but at least its dividend looks sustainable, with its profit and cashflow payout ratios within reasonable limits. With the way things are shaping up from a dividend perspective, we'd be inclined to steer clear of Eaton.So if you're still interested in Eaton despite it's poor dividend qualities, you should be well informed on some of the risks facing this stock. Our analysis shows 2 warning signs for Eaton and you should be aware of them before buying any shares.Generally, we wouldn't recommend just buying the first dividend stock you see. Here's a curated list of interesting stocks that are strong dividend payers.Have feedback on this article? Concerned about the content? Get in touch with us directly.

At this point, I'll turn the call over to John.John Larsen: Thank you, Susan. Hello, everyone, and thank you for joining us. 2022 was another successful year of solid operations and financial performance. This was our 13th straight year of delivering results in our 5% to 7% adjusted EPS growth range and the 20th year, two decades straight, of consecutive dividend increases. We had one of our best reliability years on record with top-tier performance. Our wind generation produced the most wind energy in our history, providing approximately $160 million of fuel cost savings for our customers. We continued our progress towards net zero, decreasing carbon dioxide by nearly 40% off of 2005 levels, and we kept up 2022 with very strong economic development in both Iowa and Wisconsin with over 100 megawatts of announced load that will bring new jobs and new investments.Story continuesAs I reflect on the past year, what makes me most proud of Alliant Energy is the continued dedication and service from our employees. As they strengthen our connection with the customers and communities we proudly serve. In 2023, we will be celebrating Alliant Energy's 25th year. I'm proud to be part of Alliant Energy. I'm proud of our team, and I'm inspired by our purpose to serve customers and build stronger communities. Our employees focus on this purpose has enabled us to once again, deliver the results you have come to expect from Alliant Energy. Our purpose continues to be the source of our strength and guides us through the ever-changing dynamics, within our economy and our industry. I'll highlight a few areas of progress and then turn it over to Robert to recap financial results and provide an update on regulatory proceedings.In 2022, we continue to execute on our Clean Energy Blueprint by adding renewables in the states where our customers live, which allows us to invest in the communities we served and add skilled union jobs and local revenues. This is another example of how our purpose is at the center of our strategy. We added 250 megawatts of solar at our Bear Creek, North Rock and Wood County Wisconsin sites, positioning us as the largest owner-operator of solar generation in Wisconsin. We are on track to bring into service an additional 850 megawatts of utility-scale solar, by the first half of 2024 in Wisconsin. We continue to progress our Clean Energy Blueprint in Iowa, advancing renewables and our efforts to place electric lines underground, improving the reliability of our system.And while we are not yet at the conclusion of the advanced ratemaking process in Iowa for our solar and storage projects, we continue to follow the well-defined steps within the regulatory and procedural process to demonstrate that these projects are cost-effective and reasonable. We remain confident these projects are in the best interest of our customers and will supply the energy, reliability and resilience, that our customers depend on. Another great success story is the advancement of solar gardens. We are building one near Cedar Rapids, Iowa with Transamerica and Aegon as our main customers. And we're partnering with Mercury Marine in Wisconsin to build a similar solar facility. These projects help advance the sustainability objectives of our customers.And we also use these local investments to advance our focus on the social part of ESG, providing some of the solar energy to partners like Habitat for Humanity. This continued focus on economic development and our customers were contributing factors, in being named a top utility in economic development by Site Selection magazine, for the fourth year in a row. And I'm proud to say that this work also contributed to the recently being awarded the Chairman's Award for Workforce Development leadership, which is the center for energy workforce development's highest honor. While we were proud to receive many recognitions this past year for the work that we do in our communities, the recognition I'm most proud of, focuses on our employee experience.For the fifth year in a row, we were named by the Human Rights Campaign Foundation, as the best place to work. And for the fifth year in a row to Forbes list of America's best midsized employers. And speaking with many of you, one of the things I'm reminded of is our strong core investment thesis. That is why you choose to invest in our company. Simply put, we delivered consistent results. Our well-executed forward-thinking and flexible strategy, coupled with constructive regulatory jurisdictions, has been a major part of our success. We not only deliver near-term results, but continue to take steps to help reduce future risks and provide the stability investors have come to expect from our company. A well-executed strategy has positioned us as a leader on the path to a clean, reliable and affordable energy future.We are well positioned to quickly adapt to a dynamic economic environment and weather challenges, while delivering on investor and customer expectations. 2022 was a clear example of this. Our efforts to move lines underground, continue the advancement of solar projects and strong operations in the face of weather events. While delivering solid results for our investors and reliable service for our customers, underscores the flexibility of our strategy and the dedication of the team, I am privileged to lead. And speaking of dedication, I want to pass on my appreciation to our employees that have worked through difficult conditions in the recent weather event to safely restore our power to our customers. As we move forward in 2023, you can have confidence that we will continue to take the required action that is needed to meet our customers' needs.Oil and gas, Industry, EnergyPhoto by American Public Power Association on UnsplashWe thank each one of you for continuing to be engaged in our journey and we look forward to connecting with you throughout 2023. At this time, I will now turn the call over to Robert.Robert Durian: Thanks, John. Good morning, everyone. Yesterday, we announced 2022 GAAP earnings of $2.73 per share compared to $2.63 per share in 2021. On an adjusted basis, which excluded the impacts of temperatures and non-recurring adjustments, our earnings per share increased 6% from 2021. Looking year-over-year, the increase in 2022 was driven by higher earnings from capital investments at our Wisconsin utility and higher electric and gas margins. These favorable drivers were partially offset by higher financing and depreciation expenses. Our diverse retail customer base supported the higher electric and gas margins in 2022. Residential temperature-normalized electric sales increased by almost 1%, largely due to strong customer growth.We also saw higher-than-expected sales from commercial customers with continued recovery from COVID for several business sectors in our service territory. These were offset by lower industrial sales, primarily due to temporary plant shutdowns at some of our larger customers. In 2022, we also saw a better than expected temperature-normalized natural gas sales enabled by solid customer growth. The 2022 results we are sharing today are result of our consistent efforts to manage through and mitigate ongoing inflationary pressures. We're extremely proud that we kept 2022 utility operating expenses in line with 2021 and we were able to manage through and offset the negative impacts on earnings from rising interest and fuel costs. Our work in 2022 accelerated strategic initiatives that will set us up for many years to come.We invested in economic development and electrification that will enable future sales growth. We updated our resource planning to maximize Inflation Reduction Act benefits, and meet the new MISO seasonal reliability requirements. And we accelerated technology and automation investments to improve efficiency. As we look to 2023, we anticipate operating and maintenance expenses will be lower than 2022, continuing our trend of flat to declining O&amp;M to enable cost savings for our customers. We recorded a few nonrecurring adjustments in 2022. These included $0.03 per share related to the Iowa state income tax rate change, $0.02 per share related to retirement plan settlement losses, at the end of 2022 and $0.02 per share related to a reserve adjustment for American Transmission Companies base ROE changes.Turning to 2023. We are positioned for another year of consistent 5% to 7% earnings per share growth. We are affirming our 2023 earnings guidance range with a midpoint of $2.89 per share, representing a 6% increase over 2022 adjusted earnings. Our 2023 earnings drivers include earnings on customer investments in our core utility business, and our continued efforts to reduce cost to increase customer value. Higher depreciation and financing expenses associated with these investments will partially offset these positive drivers. Our efforts to support customer value through making smart investments in our future support our ability to consistently deliver strong financial results. Other key assumptions for 2023 include growing sales by approximately 0.5% of 1%, led by higher sales to our commercial and industrial customers.And we estimate a consolidated effective tax rate of 1%, with substantial production tax credits generated by our large wind portfolio and growing solar portfolio, helping us maintain low effective tax rates for the upcoming year and several more years to come. The benefits from these production tax credits are passed on to our electric customers to help them manage their bills and therefore, are largely earnings neutral. Our financing plans for 2023 include a mix of new debt supplemented with modest new common equity to finance our investments in renewable projects and to support refinancing a $400 million debt maturity in 2023. In December, we launched an At The Market or ATM program as our intended approach for raising up to $225 million of new common equity throughout 2023, which is in addition to the $25 million of common equity that we expect to raise under our DRIP finance.And in January, we entered into an interest rate swap to help reduce the risk of rising interest rates related to a portion of our variable-rate debt. The 2023 financing plan is driven by robust capital expenditure plans and supports our objective to maintain the capital structures at our two utilities consistent with our most recent regulatory decisions. Next, I'll highlight this year's key regulatory initiatives. Last month, we provided additional testimony and evidence to the Iowa Utilities Board and IPL's advanced remaking proceeding. This testimony and evidence further demonstrates that IPL is taking prudent actions to meet its customers' need for capacity by advancing Iowa-based solar and storage projects that represent cost-effective solutions compared to alternative options available in the market.We also informed the IUB that we have identified our self-developed Creston and Wever projects as the second 200 megawatts of solar products, in addition to the 200 megawatts build transfer solar projects at the Duane Arnold site. To date, we've provided all the information requested by the IUB demonstrating that these projects are in the best interest of our customers. The IUB's decision this week to pause the advanced rate making process is procedural. We are working through both the regulatory and judicial processes in parallel, and following the well-defined process to move these projects forward. Next, we expect the IUB to file a response with the District Court in early March. We are confident these projects will provide considerable customer benefits, including reliability and resiliency and remain committed to executing these projects while we await the IUB's final rule.In Wisconsin, we are awaiting a decision from the PSCW on WEC Energy's purchase of a portion of our West Riverside natural gas generating facility. We are also anticipating decisions from the PSCW in 2023 on WPL's request for 274 megawatts of battery storage. 175 megawatts of these battery projects would complement 2 of WPL solar projects and 99 megawatts of the battery projects will be located by our Edgewater Generating Station to take advantage of the existing infrastructure and transmission rights at that location. Finally, we plan on filing a normal biennial electric and gas rate review in Wisconsin for test years 2024 and 2025 in the second quarter. In both states, we are also anticipating making filings to support additional resources for growing dispatchable generation capacity, needed to improve seasonal reliability and meet customer energy needs.As always, we continue to move forward proposing energy investments that support both sustainability and resiliency, keeping our customers' needs top of mind. I will conclude with a recap of the prominent legislation enacted this past year that has set us up for a solid future financial success, while providing significant customer cost benefits. Alliant Energy is a strong beneficiary of the Inflation Reduction Act. As it directly supports our strategic plans to advance cleaner energy for our customers, while providing significant customer and investor benefits. The IRA enables additional rate base opportunities while also lowering customer costs with a shift from tax equity to full ownership for our planned solar and battery projects. In our November 2022 refreshed capital expenditure plan, we incorporated the benefits of the IRA along with the changes from the MISO seasonal construct, which provides visibility to our planned 8% rate base growth through 2026.Another key element of the IRA improves our cash flows, through the ability to transfer renewable tax credits starting with those generated in 2023. With a large portion of wind and solar projects, we anticipate that we'll be able to transfer up to approximately $150 million of 2023 tax credits. As we continue to add more solar and battery projects over the next few years, the amount of annual transferable credits will continue to grow. We expect this to positively impact our credit metrics through acceleration of cash and reduction in future external financing needs and to lower our customer costs by reducing sharing costs on tax credit carryforwards. The IRA will provide significant benefits for our customers and investors with no notable downsides as we expect to remain exempt from the alternative minimum tax for the foreseeable future.And finally, we also expect to benefit from new state tax legislation enacted in Iowa in 2022, which is lowering state corporate tax rates, enabling us to pass millions of dollars of annual savings onto our customers in Iowa for decades into the future. We appreciate your continued support of our company and look forward to meeting with many of you in the coming months. At this time, I'll turn the call back over to the operator to facilitate the question-and-answer session.See also 11 Most Profitable Chinese Stocks and 15 Most Profitable New Stocks Today.To continue reading the Q&amp;A session, please click here.]"

146,54a279ea-8809-34ac-9e52-2b0e4ac4a9a7,UNP,2023-02-27,Union Pacific will replace rail CEO amid hedge fund pressure,AP Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/union-pacific-replace-rail-ceo-231833649.html,1677453513,STORY,['UNP'],"[OMAHA, Neb. (AP) — Union Pacific announced plans Sunday to replace its CEO later this year after a hedge fund that holds a $1.6 billion stake in the railroad went public with its concerns about his leadership.The managing partner of Soroban Capital Partners, Eric Mandelblatt, said in a letter that the Omaha, Nebraska-based railroad has lagged behind its peers during Lance Fritz' tenure over the past eight years and that a leadership change is overdue. The hedge fund has been privately pressuring Union Pacific to oust Fritz at least since last year.“UNP (Union Pacific) has repeatedly and significantly failed to reach its potential under Mr. Fritz’s leadership,” Mandelblatt wrote. “UNP has ranked the worst in safety, volume growth, revenue growth, cost management, EBIT growth, and total shareholder return. These are highly underwhelming results despite UNP having the premier railroad franchise in North America.”Mandelblatt urged the railroad to hire former Chief Operations Officer Jim Vena, who helped overhaul Union Pacific's operations several years ago. But the railroad's board said in a statement that it has been working with a leadership consultant since last year to identify the best internal and external candidates for the job.Vena was brought in to Union Pacific in 2019 from Canadian National to help the railroad change to a new operating model that relies on fewer, longer trains and significantly fewer employees and locomotives to move freight, but Vena left after less than two years on the job.Nearly all the major U.S. freight railroads have adopted that model since CSX first began using it in 2017 after it was pressured by a different hedge fund to make changes although rail unions have expressed concerns that this “precision scheduled railroading” model has made the industry riskier because workers are spread so thin after nearly one-third of all rail jobs have been eliminated over the past six years. The unions say these practices make incidents like Norfolk Southern's fiery derailment in Ohio earlier this month more likely, but the railroads have defended their safety record.Story continuesUP’s lead independent board member Michael McCarthy praised Fritz in a statement Sunday for helping grow the railroad’s profits through the uncertain times of the pandemic — and through the challenges of last year’s bitter contract negotiations with its 12 unions.“He has capably led our company during a time of significant challenge and change, positioning Union Pacific to deliver long-term sustainable value for shareholders and customers,” McCarthy said. “We are immensely grateful to have Lance’s continuing leadership and support and know he will ensure a smooth transition.”The railroad did post a $1.6 billion profit in the fourth quarter, but over the past year it has struggled at times to handle all the shipments companies asked it to deliver. Twice regulators ordered Union Pacific to deliver emergency shipments to livestock producer Foster Farms to ensure that company wouldn’t run out of feed for the millions of chickens it raises.The U.S. Surface Transportation Board also held a special hearing in December to examine the way Union Pacific puts short-term limits on shipments to try and clear up congestion on its rail network because the railroad has been using that tactic much more than other major freight railroads.Union Pacific has been steadily improving its performance since last spring as it hired hundreds of additional employees to operate its trains.Fritz said in a statement that he has been honored to lead the railroad he’s worked at for the past 22 years. He praised Union Pacific’s employees and touted the railroad’s performance without directly addressing the hedge fund’s criticism.“Union Pacific has embarked on a transformative journey that will result in stronger, more consistent service for our customers, with enhanced earnings growth and value creation for our shareholders,” Fritz said.Union Pacific is one of the nation’s largest railroads with a network of 32,400 miles (52,000 kilometers) of track in 23 Western states.]"
