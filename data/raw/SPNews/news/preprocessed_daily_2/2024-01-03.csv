But with many investors expecting interest rates to stabilize or decline in 2024, it makes sense to consider adding a few of these unloved blue chip dividend plays back to your portfolio.', ""That's because over the long run, many stable blue chip tech stocks with high yields tend to outperform fixed-income investments with set maturity dates. So as the new year starts, I think it would be smart to buy three dividend plays: Cisco (NASDAQ: CSCO), Texas Instruments (NASDAQ: TXN), and Corning (NYSE: GLW)."", ""Cisco is the world's largest networking hardware and software company. The company struggled with supply chain constraints in fiscal 2022 (which ended in July 2022), but it overcame those challenges in fiscal 2023, and revenue growth accelerated again."", ""Unfortunately, that recovery ended in the first quarter of fiscal 2024 as Cisco's revenue declined sequentially again. Macro headwinds caused the slowdown, driving many of its large enterprise, service provider, and cloud customers to deploy their purchased hardware at a slower-than-expected rate."", 'Cisco CEO Chuck Robbins admitted that customers were still waiting to deploy ""one quarter to two quarters\' worth of shipped orders"" -- and that the company\'s revenue would drop 4% to 6% for the full year as its adjusted EPS stays roughly flat. That outlook weighed down the stock, but it now trades at just 13 times forward earnings and pays a high forward dividend yield of 3.1%. That low valuation and high yield should limit its downside potential until the company overcomes near-term challenges.', ""Cisco is also in the process of acquiring Splunk to expand its networking observability and cybersecurity platforms. That $28 billion deal, which is expected to close in the third quarter of calendar 2024, should reduce Cisco's dependence on traditional networking hardware and increase the stickiness of its software and services ecosystem."", ""Texas Instruments manufactures analog and embedded chips for a broad range of customers. These chips aren't as powerful as CPUs or GPUs, but they handle essential tasks such as wireless communications and power management features."", ""Over the past year, the softness of TI's industrial and communications markets -- which were both heavily exposed to the macro headwinds -- offset the stronger growth in its automotive, personal electronics, and enterprise systems markets. That's why analysts expect its revenue and earnings to decline 12% and 25%, respectively, in 2023."", ""That cyclical slowdown, along with the company's commitment to ramp up its spending on its long-term transition from 200mm to 300mm wafers, which will reduce the costs of its unpackaged parts by roughly 40% over the long term, spooked the bulls. For 2024, analysts expect its revenue to rise just 1% as its earnings decline another 6%."", ""That near-term outlook seems grim, but TI has weathered downturns before. It's also committed to returning most of its free cash flow (FCF) to its investors through buybacks and dividends. The company bought back nearly half its shares since 2004 and raised its dividend annually for the past 20 years. Its attractive forward yield of 3.1%, along with a reasonable forward multiple of 25, should limit the downside potential as the macro environment improves and TI upgrades its plants."", 'Corning is the creator of Gorilla Glass, the chemically hardened glass that shields LCD and OLED screens on smartphones and other devices. It also sells glass substrates for display panels, optical equipment, lab equipment for life science companies, and particulate filters for automakers.', ""Corning's sales surged 25% in 2021 as the pandemic ended, its core markets stabilized, and it received fresh orders from Apple. But in 2022, Corning's revenue rose only 1% -- and analysts anticipate a 9% decline in 2023. That deceleration was largely driven by the softness of its optical and display panel markets, Apple's slower iPhone sales, and tough currency headwinds. Analysts expect earnings to decline 19%."", 'But just like Cisco and TI, Corning has survived cyclical downturns before. Corning reduced its share count by nearly 40% over the past decade, and it still looks cheap at 15 times forward earnings. It also pays a high forward yield of 3.7%.', ""Corning's growth should remain weak throughout the first half of 2024, but sales should bounce back in the second half as the telecom display, semiconductor, smartphone, tablet, and notebook markets recover. Analysts expect the company's revenue and EPS to rise 2% and 17%, respectively, in 2024 -- so it might be a good time to load up on this blue chip stalwart."", 'Should you invest $1,000 in Cisco Systems right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Cisco Systems, consider this:', ""The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Cisco Systems wasn't one of them.

Geopolitical tensions, economic factors, weather uncertainties, and production and storage levels all cast shadows on the horizon. At this time, we advise investors to focus on stocks like Range Resources RRC, Coterra Energy CTRA and Cheniere Energy LNG.', ""The natural gas story in 2023 initially saw an optimistic trajectory, fueled by concerns over supply shortages and scorching heatwaves in the United States. However, this narrative swiftly pivoted as robust production, abundant supply, and mild winter weather triggered a collapse in prices. By the end of the year, the commodity was down 43.8% — the most significant decline since 2006 — closing out at $2.514 on the New York Mercantile Exchange.Overall, the natural gas market witnessed a tumultuous 2023, marked by an overarching downturn in performance. This primarily resulted from a surge in domestic production, which hit a staggering 105 billion cubic feet per day (Bcf/d) in November 2023.The high production levels, coupled with a milder winter, translated to reduced consumption and a subsequent surge in storage inventories. For context, the U.S. benchmark, Henry Hub spot price, averaged a modest $2.80 per million British thermal units (MMBtu) during the winter heating season.Pointing to an oversupplied market scenario, the U.S. Energy Department's latest weekly inventory release showed that stockpiles held in underground storage in the lower 48 states are at 3,490 billion cubic feet (Bcf), which is 348 Bcf (11.1%) above the year-ago level and 316 Bcf (10%) higher than the five-year average."", ""Economic Landscape: The global economic landscape emerges as a pivotal player in shaping energy demand, including natural gas, as 2024 begins. While a gradual recovery is on the horizon, lingering worries about global inflation, particularly in Europe, loom large. These concerns could cast a shadow on industrial and commercial energy demand, potentially impacting natural gas consumption.North American gas markets may grapple with early 2024 weakness, driven by factors such as heightened storage inventories, potential warmer-than-usual temperatures and subdued demand from industrial and commercial sectors.Geopolitical Factors: Geopolitical intricacies played a defining role in shaping the natural gas landscape in 2023. The loss of the Nord Stream pipeline reverberated through European gas supplies, underscoring the market's sensitivity to geopolitical shifts. Despite challenges, adept management of gas storage and strategic U.S. liquefied natural gas (‘LNG’) exports, especially to Europe and Asia, demonstrated resilience. As geopolitical tensions persist, international conflicts could continue to reverberate across natural gas supply dynamics.Weather and Its Impact: As is the norm with natural gas, changes in temperature and weather forecasts can lead to price swings. In 2023, a mild winter tempered demand for the fuel during the traditionally high-consumption heating season. This year too, the specter of unpredictable weather patterns, including the potential for milder winters, poses an ongoing challenge with implications for natural gas price stability.LNG Silver Lining: A stable demand catalyst in the form of continued strong LNG feedgas deliveries should support natural gas in 2024. LNG shipments for export from the United States have been elevated for months, reaching record levels due to environmental reasons and Europe’s endeavor to move away from its dependence on Russian natural gas supplies due to the war in Ukraine.Drop in Rig Count: There are signs of curtailment in domestic volumes. According to energy services provider Baker Hughes, the U.S. natural gas rig count — a pointer to where production is headed — was down some 23% in 2023. Industry observers believe this could set the stage for a pullback in near-term drilling and supplies."", 'Based on several factors, the space is currently quite unpredictable and spooked by the sudden changes in weather and production patterns. As such, investors are clueless about what to do. As of now, the lingering uncertainty over the fuel means that they should preferably hold on to fundamentally strong stocks like Range Resources, Coterra Energy and Cheniere Energy.Range Resources: It is a leading operator in the prolific Appalachian Basin — a premier natural gas play — with huge inventories of low-risk drilling sites that are likely to provide production for several decades. About 68% of this Zacks #3 Rank (Hold) company’s total output is natural gas.You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Range Resources beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings in each of the trailing four quarters, with the average being 33.6%. Valued at around $7.4 billion, RRC has gained 30.6% in a year.Coterra Energy: It is an independent upstream operator primarily engaged in the exploration, development and production of natural gas. Headquartered in Houston, TX, the firm owns some 183,000 net acres in the gas-producing Marcellus Shale of the Appalachian Basin. This Zacks Rank #3 company churned out an average of 2,204 million cubic feet on a daily basis from these assets in 2022.Coterra beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings in each of the trailing four quarters, the average being 11.8%. Valued at around $19.2 billion, CTRA has gained 10% in a year.Cheniere Energy: Being the first company to receive regulatory approval to export LNG from its 2.6 billion cubic feet per day Sabine Pass terminal, Cheniere Energy certainly enjoys a distinct competitive advantage.Cheniere Energy has a projected earnings growth rate of 602.3% for the current year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for this #3 Ranked natural gas exporter’s 2023 earnings has been revised 17.3% upward over the past 60 days.

Why take on the risk of loss that comes with a stock purchase when you can get a CD with a 5% yield?', ""The answer is that the income a CD pays won't increase over time like the dividends being paid by Alexandria Real Estate Equities\xa0(NYSE: ARE) and Kilroy Realty (NYSE: KRC). That's the foundation of the story, but there's more to know about these two office landlords."", ""Alexandria gets lumped into the office REIT subsector, which is appropriate. But it doesn't really own the type of offices that most of its peers own. Alexandria's portfolio is centered around medical research facilities. These assets are usually a combination of laboratory space and more traditional office space. It is a very specialized type of property and demand remains quite strong, noting the REIT's occupancy of 93.7% and rental rate increases of around 33% through the first three quarters of 2023 on renewing leases."", ""But Wall Street doesn't see that nuance right now. Indeed, traditional office properties still suffer from the fallout of the pandemic-era work-from-home trend, which is why Alexandria's stock currently trades more than 40% below where it was at the start of 2020. And yet its dividend was just increased in December, which suggests that the company is doing just fine."", ""In fact, its funds from operations (FFO) payout ratio is around 55%. That's a pretty modest number that leaves material room for adversity before the distribution would be at risk. To be fair, office landlords usually have lower payout ratios (office properties tend to be more expensive to operate than other assets), but there's no reason to fear Alexandria is going to cut its dividend. Meanwhile, the dividend yield is near 10-year highs at around 4% or so even after a recent rally in the stock price. There's still time to invest here if you can stomach swimming against the current."", ""If owning Alexandria is like swimming against the current, Kilroy is something akin to jumping into the deep end. This office REIT is largely focused on traditional office space (though it is increasing its exposure to medical research assets) located on the West Coast (it has a small position in Texas, as it essentially followed its tech customers to the state). The work-from-home trend has been a major headwind, with Kilroy recently highlighting that its vacancy rate was 14%. Only that's better than the average for the company's markets of 19%."", 'The differentiating factor here is that Kilroy tends to operate modern, well-located assets with plenty of amenities. These are A-rated properties that businesses and their employees want to be in. In hard times, companies tend to upgrade into assets like the ones Kilroy owns. In good times, companies may have to fight to get into them. Yes, times are tough today in the office sector, but Kilroy is fairly well-positioned. That includes both the quality of its assets and the markets it serves, which are still some of the most vibrant technology regions in the country.', ""At 5.4%, Kilroy's dividend yield isn't nearly as high as it was before its recent stock rally. But the shares are still over 50% below where they were prior to the pandemic. It seems like Wall Street is starting to recognize that this high-quality office landlord isn't in as bad a shape as some once feared. Notably, its FFO payout ratio was just a touch under 50% in the third quarter, which is very robust."", ""The big attraction here with Kilroy and Alexandria is that, even after a bump up in their stock prices, they remain well below their pre-COVID-19 high-water marks. Both of these office REITs have handled this difficult period fairly well, and there's no particular reason to believe they are going to stumble anytime soon. Risk-averse investors might want to tread with caution, but those willing to take a contrarian view will likely see that there's still some value here even as the broader REIT sector bounces back."", 'Should you invest $1,000 in Kilroy Realty right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Kilroy Realty, consider this:', ""The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Kilroy Realty wasn't one of them.

Despite its impressive finances, the beverage giant's stock performance trailed the Dow Jones Industrial Average by a wide margin in 2023."", ""Wall Street is concerned about Coke's relatively weak sales outlook as consumer demand tilts away from traditional sodas. Shares also seem expensive, compared to industry peers."", ""The good news is that you've got some attractive options among dividend stocks if you're looking for alternatives to Coke stock today. Walmart (NYSE: WMT) has a similarly dominant market share, for example, and PepsiCo (NASDAQ: PEP) shares are valued at a discount compared to the beverage titan. Let's look at some excellent reasons to buy these two dividend giants instead of Coca-Cola right now."", ""Walmart stock fared better than Coke in 2023, but the retailer still trailed the wider market for the year. Its 11.2% increase for the year wasn't enough to keep up with the Dow's 13.7% rise or the 24.2% spike that investors saw in the S&P 500. Coke stock fell 7.4% in 2023."", 'Yet better returns are likely on the way. In mid-November, Walmart reported solid customer traffic trends heading into the core holiday shopping season. Comparable-store sales in the U.S. market rose 5%, thanks to the combination of a 3% traffic increase and 2% higher average spending. Coke, on the other hand, has had to rely mostly on price increases to keep sales rising in the past year.', ""Walmart is boosting profitability and generating much stronger cash flow lately, which means management has more capital available to invest in the business and send back to shareholders through stock buybacks and a rising dividend. Sure, Walmart's yield is about half of Coke's 3.1%, but with profits rising faster than sales this year, investors can expect more significant dividend hikes ahead. Meanwhile, consider taking advantage of this cheaply valued stock that's priced at 0.7x annual sales, compared to Costco Wholesale's price-to-sales ratio (P/S) of 1.2."", ""If you'd prefer to stay in the same industry, consider PepsiCo as another great alternative. This dividend stock is arguably less risky than Coke, due to its more diverse sales portfolio that includes snack and breakfast foods in addition to beverages. Investors saw concrete benefits of this diversification during the early phases of the pandemic when Coke's sales plummeted while Pepsi's remained more stable."", 'Pepsi has its share of challenges, to be sure. The company is posting negative sales volumes in several of its niches, which means investors will want to watch that metric for a rebound going forward.', ""Yet profitability is strong and rising, cash flow is ample, and Pepsi has a clear path toward continued market-share gains as it innovates across brands like Doritos, Quaker, and Gatorade. Pepsi's dividend yield sits close to Coke's 3% rate, offering a nice bonus for patient investors willing to hold this stock over the long term."", ""Both companies have decades of experience behind them at steadily boosting their payouts each year. And there's no reason why both stocks couldn't be a good fit in a diversified portfolio."", ""But Pepsi, along with Walmart, offers some attractive features that aren't available in a Coca-Cola investment at the moment. Consider keeping them on your watch list, then, if you're looking for other strong dividend options."", 'Should you invest $1,000 in Walmart right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Walmart, consider this:', ""The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Walmart wasn't one of them.

If you still have some burning questions about this type of valuation, take a look at the Simply Wall St analysis model."", ' Check out our latest analysis for Microchip Technology ', ""We're using the 2-stage growth model, which simply means we take in account two stages of company's growth. In the initial period the company may have a higher growth rate and the second stage is usually assumed to have a stable growth rate. In the first stage we need to estimate the cash flows to the business over the next ten years. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years."", 'A DCF is all about the idea that a dollar in the future is less valuable than a dollar today, so we need to discount the sum of these future cash flows to arrive at a present value estimate:', '2024', '2025', '2026', '2027', '2028', '2029', '2030', '2031', '2032', '2033', ' Levered FCF ($, Millions) ', 'US$3.11b', 'US$2.44b', 'US$2.80b', 'US$3.06b', 'US$3.21b', 'US$3.33b', 'US$3.44b', 'US$3.54b', 'US$3.64b', 'US$3.73b', 'Growth Rate Estimate Source', 'Analyst x7', 'Analyst x7', 'Analyst x5', 'Analyst x1', 'Analyst x1', 'Est @ 3.75%', 'Est @ 3.29%', 'Est @ 2.97%', 'Est @ 2.75%', 'Est @ 2.59%', ' Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 9.0% ', 'US$2.9k', 'US$2.1k', 'US$2.2k', 'US$2.2k', 'US$2.1k', 'US$2.0k', 'US$1.9k', 'US$1.8k', 'US$1.7k', 'US$1.6k', '(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$20b', ""We now need to calculate the Terminal Value, which accounts for all the future cash flows after this ten year period.

In this case we have used the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield (2.2%) to estimate future growth.

The first is the discount rate and the other is the cash flows. If you don't agree with these result, have a go at the calculation yourself and play with the assumptions. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Microchip Technology as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 9.0%, which is based on a levered beta of 1.353. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole.

These companies cover commercial and personal properties, automobiles, marine, livestock, aviation, personal accident, life, including permanent and term insurance, supplemental accident and health insurance, workers’ compensation, annuity products, private mortgage insurance, et al.

This lowers concentration risk. Increased awareness, driving higher demand for protection products, should benefit sales and premiums of life insurance operations.

Also, per Deloitte Insights, the transition to green energy and related insurance products, as well as exposure to intangible assets, offers growth opportunities. Per Fitch Ratings, personal auto, which suffered in 2023, is likely to deliver a better performance in 2024.Merger and acquisitions:\xa0 Consolidation in the multi-line insurance industry is expected to continue as players look to diversify their operations into new business lines and geographies. Buying businesses along the same lines is driven by the players’ need to gain a fair market share and grow in their niche areas. The M&A environment, which slowed down in the first half of 2023, regained some pace in the second half. M&As are expected to gain momentum in 2024. \xa0Increased adoption of technology: Digitalization has increased by leaps and bounds. The industry is witnessing greater use of technology like blockchain, AI, advanced analytics, telematics, cloud computing and robotic process automation to expedite business operations and save costs.\xa0 Many life insurers are selling policies online that appeal to the tech-savvy population. At the same time, the use of real-time data is making premium calculation easier and reducing risk. The P&C industry, in particular, also witnessed the emergence of insurtech — technology-led insurers — sparking competition for incumbent players. Insurers remain focused on ramping up data and analytics capabilities as well as realizing the benefit of the technological infrastructure per Deloitte Insights.

The S&P 500 soared 24%, while the Nasdaq rocketed 43%. Some stocks enjoyed even better performances.', 'However, there were some notable laggards. Several top dividend stocks underperformed last year, and because of that, they look like great buys this month. In particular, NextEra Energy (NYSE: NEE), Brookfield Infrastructure (NYSE: BIPC)(NYSE: BIP), and Realty Income (NYSE: O) stand out as top buys for income investors in January. They offer higher-yielding payouts that should continue growing in 2024 and beyond. ', ""NextEra Energy's stock price tumbled more than 27% in 2023 -- a sell-off that came even though the leading clean energy-focused utility was having another strong year. Its adjusted earnings per share were up 10.8% through the third quarter, putting the company on track to achieve its full-year forecast. Management also reaffirmed its view that it expected earnings to be toward the upper end of the long-term growth target range of 6% to 8% annually through 2026. That optimism came despite some issues with its affiliate, NextEra Energy Partners, which had to slow its dividend growth rate due to the impact of higher interest rates. "", ""Due to its share price slump, NextEra Energy's dividend yield has risen to over 3%. That's around double the S&P 500's average dividend yield today. That's a nice starting point for such an excellent dividend stock. The company has increased its payouts annually for more than a quarter century, growing them at an 11% compound annual rate during the last decade. "", ""NextEra should have plenty of power to continue pushing its payouts higher. It currently expects to increase its dividend by around 10% through at least this year. Meanwhile, it has lots of visibility into its earnings growth through 2026. It should also have lots of fuel to continue growing after that, given the world's tremendous need to continue investing in clean energy in the decades ahead to reduce carbon emissions. "", 'Shares of Brookfield Infrastructure slumped more than 9% in 2023. That decline pushed its dividend yield up to 4.3%.', ""Brookfield Infrastructure had another good year in 2023. Based on its outlook for the final quarter, it expects its funds from operations (FFO) per share to grow by more than 10% for the year. That's a continuation of the company's strong growth rate over the last decade (11% compound annual FFO per share growth and 9% compound annual dividend growth). "", ""Meanwhile, Brookfield is in a strong position to continue growing its earnings and dividend in 2024 and beyond. It closed several acquisitions toward the end of last year (a leading container leasing company and three data center platforms), giving it lots of momentum heading into 2024. On top of that, it has a strong organic growth profile driven by elevated inflation and several near-term expansion projects (Heartland Petrochemical Complex, its investments in Intel's semiconductor manufacturing complexes, and several data center development projects). These catalysts could drive double-digit annual FFO per share growth in the near term. That would easily support Brookfield's expectations of delivering 5% to 9% annual dividend growth over the long term. "", ""Realty Income's stock also slumped about 9% last year. That drove the dividend yield of the real estate investment trust (REIT) up to 5.3%."", 'The REIT slipped even though 2023 was another solid year of steady growth. The company was on track to acquire $9 billion of real estate last year. Those deals and rising rental rates pushed its adjusted FFO per share up by more than 4% year-over-year in the third quarter. That steady growth enabled the REIT to raise its monthly payouts five times last year. ', ""Realty Income has already gotten a head start on growing in 2024. It agreed to buy fellow REIT Spirit Realty in a $9.3 billion deal. The company expects the acquisition to increase its adjusted FFO by more than 2.5% this year. Meanwhile, the combined company is expected to generate over $800 million in post-dividend free cash flow in 2024. It anticipates reinvesting this cash flow into new income-generating real estate to push its growth rate into its 4% to 5% annual target range without raising any additional equity capital. There's upside to that growth rate if the REIT raises equity capital to fund additional investments. Given the visibility it has into its growth, Realty Income should have no problem increasing its dividend, which it has done 123 times since its public market listing in 1994. "", 'With their share prices slumping last year, NextEra Energy, Brookfield Infrastructure, and Realty Income offer even more attractive dividend yields to start 2024. Meanwhile, all three companies appear poised to continue increasing their dividends this year.

Growth stocks can build you a fortune if chosen right, and a new year is a perfect time to evaluate your investments and add some stocks to your portfolio. Salesforce (NYSE: CRM), Albemarle (NYSE: ALB), and Symbotic (NASDAQ: SYM) are three such incredible growth stocks that are screaming buys for 2024 right now. Here's why."", ""You wouldn't expect a commodity stock to make it to a list of growth stocks, but Albemarle is an exception. The lithium stock was hammered in 2023 as lithium prices plunged on fears of a slowdown in demand for electric vehicle (EV) batteries. Although Albemarle also sells bromine and specialty chemicals, it is the world's largest lithium producer and relies heavily on lithium for growth. The stock, however, is a no-brainer buy for 2024 and beyond at its current price."", ""Albemarle stock is currently trading at a price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of only 5 times and a price to cash flow of only around 7 times. It also pays a dividend that has increased every year for 28 consecutive years. Further, Albemarle's top line is still growing despite falling lithium prices -- it expects to grow sales by at least 30% in 2023, led by higher volumes under long-term contracts."", ""Driven by capacity expansions, Albemarle still expects sales volumes to grow at a compound annual growth rate of 20% to 30% in 2024 and beyond, despite the market's fears of falling demand for lithium. By 2027, the company expects to nearly triple its volumes."", ""Albemarle is also still keen to pursue acquisitions after walking out on its $4 billion deal for Australia's Liontown Resources in 2023 because of complexities. Albemarle has a strong balance sheet and cash position, so making opportunistic acquisitions in a down lithium market should prove to be a smart move."", ""Albemarle has unbeatable clout in the lithium market, and demand for the element should only rise as more EVs replace gas-guzzling cars globally. With Albemarle still projecting double-digit sales growth for 2023 and 2024, now is a great time to buy the growth stock while it's still languishing."", 'For a decade now, Salesforce has dominated the global customer relationship market (CRM) in terms of revenue. The CRM software solutions giant has grown at a torrid pace in recent years, nearly tripling its revenue in just the past five years. Salesforce generated $31.4 billion in revenue in the financial year that ended Jan 31, 2023, and converted nearly 20% of its revenue into free cash flow.', 'Salesforce management has relentlessly focused on restructuring the business to boost productivity and profitability over the past year or so. Its efforts are already showing up in the numbers. Salesforce is on track to deliver double-digit revenue growth, earn an operating margin of around 14%, and generate record cash flows for the ongoing financial year ending Jan. 31, 2024.', ""Demand for most of Salesforce's products, including MuleSoft, Tableau, and Slack, remains strong. Importantly, Salesforce is diving deep into artificial intelligence (AI) with products like Data Cloud and believes AI could be a game-changer for the company going forward."", ""With its remaining performance obligations (RPO) jumping 21% year over year in the third quarter to $48.3 billion, Salesforce is entering fiscal year 2025 on a solid note. RPO denotes contracted revenue, which could convert into actual revenue and is, therefore, an important gauge of Salesforce's revenue potential."", '2023 was a transformative year for Salesforce, one that should set the pace for bigger things to come at the company. That makes Salesforce an incredibly compelling growth stock to buy for 2024.', ""2023 was a massive year for Symbotic. The company sells AI-powered warehouse automation systems with supporting software and maintenance services under long-term contracts. And demand for its products and services is rising steadily. Symbotic's revenue surged 98% to $1.8 billion in the fiscal year that ended Sept. 30, 2023."", 'Most importantly, Symbotic ended last fiscal year with a massive backlog of $23 billion. That includes a backlog of $11 billion from its joint venture, GreenBox, with Japanese multinational company Softbank Group. Symbotic owns a 35% stake in the six-year venture and expects to generate $500 million in annual revenue with high margins once it completes installing all systems and software for GreenBox.', 'From that standpoint, 2024 should be a big year for Symbotic as it starts generating systems revenue from GreenBox. The venture will also add a new source of revenue -- warehouse-as-a-service -- for Symbotic and could, therefore, open up massive opportunities for the company in the coming years.', ""GreenBox also aligns with Symbotic's new strategy of reducing reliance on manufacturing and opting to outsource manufacturing and systems installations while management focuses on innovation and product development. The move should not only cut costs but also help Symbotic deploy systems faster at customers' ends and, therefore, boost revenue. Symbotic already boasts some big names among its customers, including retail giants Walmart, Target, and Albertsons."", ""With Symbotic projecting at least 70% year-over-year revenue growth for the first quarter of fiscal year 2024, this is one growth stock you'd want to buy hand over fist for 2024."", 'Should you invest $1,000 in Albemarle right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Albemarle, consider this:', ""The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Albemarle wasn't one of them.

Higher demand, driven by automated solutions for protein and bakery products, has been driving the growth of the Food Processing Equipment Group.The company remains focused on acquiring businesses to gain new customers and access new regions and product lines.

It exited the third quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $167.2 million, higher than the current maturities of long-term debt of $44.3 million. This implies that MIDD has sufficient cash to meet its current debt obligations. Also, it remains open to repurchasing shares opportunistically.

The ROE incentive aims to encourage utilities and other transmission owners to voluntarily join regional transmission organizations and ISOs.', '“PG&E’s participation in CAISO is no longer voluntary,” FERC said. “Thus, we find that PG&E is no longer eligible for the RTO Adder.”', 'FERC’s decision is the latest in a series of actions involving its RTO adder incentive for the San Francisco-based utility. The California PUC estimated the extra ROE, which would have been included in PG&E’s transmission rates, to be about $41.4 million per year.\xa0', 'In June 2022, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit ruled that PG&E was eligible for the RTO adder. However, later that year, the California General Assembly passed a bill stating that utilities like PG&E must be CAISO members.', 'In its decision, FERC dismissed PG&E’s argument that it was still eligible for the extra ROE because the legal validity of the California law had not been tested and its status could be affected by a case pending in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit that deals with the RTO incentive.', 'The RTO incentive is one part of PG&E’s $2.8 billion annual formula transmission rate request, which FERC “accepted” and set for settlement procedures and hearings.', 'In its transmission rate proposal, PG&E is seeking a 12.37% base ROE plus the RTO adder, up from an “all-in” 10.45% ROE. The higher proposed ROE reflects PG&E’s financial situation and above-average risks from wildfires and California’s inverse condemnation policy, according to the utility.', 'Parties filing protests against PG&E’s transmission rate request included the California PUC, the Transmission Agency of Northern California; Northern California Power Agency; the City of Santa Clara, California, doing business as Silicon Valley Power; 46 state water contractors;\xa0the California Department of Water Resources State Water Project; and a group of six southern California cities.', 'Meanwhile, the Department of Energy on Tuesday issued a “record of decision”\xa0to award credits to PG&E under the Civil Nuclear Credit Program for the continued operation of the 2,256-MW Diablo Canyon nuclear power plant. DOE in November decided to conditionally grant PG&E $1.1 billion\xa0under the program.', ""PG&E will be eligible to receive payments from the first award cycle of funding from the nuclear credit program over a four-year award period starting in January 2023, subject to the utility's agreement to payment terms and Nuclear Regulatory Commission license extension approvals."", 'DOE expects to make the payments annually beginning in 2025.

Data from Grand View Research shows the AI market is projected to expand at a compound annual growth rate of 37% through 2030, which would see it exceed a value of $1 trillion before the end of the decade.', ""So it's no surprise that companies worldwide have restructured their businesses to focus on the budding sector, presenting a variety of investment opportunities. Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ: AMD) and Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) are some of the most attractive options, with one making moves in AI chips and the other heavily investing in the software side of the industry."", ""So let's take a look at whether AMD or Microsoft is currently the better stock for those who want to back the rapidly expanding AI market."", ""Since its founding more than 50 years ago, AMD has become one of the biggest threats in chips. The company hasn't always been first to a market but has proven its ability to carve out a lucrative position in almost any part of the industry with its advanced technology and decisive leadership."", ""AMD CEO Lisa Su took the helm in October 2014. Since then, the company's shares have soared over 4,000% as it has become a leader in central and graphics processing units (CPUs and GPUs). In fact, AMD's CPU market share has risen from 18% in 2017 to 35% in 2023, gradually chipping away at Intel's share. Meanwhile, the tech giant has attained a significant share of desktop GPUs, second only to Nvidia."", ""As a result, AMD's expansion into AI strengthens its long-term outlook. Nvidia might have an estimated 90% market share in AI chips, but AMD's past performance suggests it will be able to secure a powerful role in the sector."", ""AMD will begin shipping its MI300X GPU this year, designed specifically to challenge Nvidia's offerings. The AI chip already has Microsoft's Azure signed on as a customer, with AMD in talks with several other tech companies."", ""It's still early days for AMD's AI journey, but it's likely to go far in the market in the coming years."", ""Microsoft got a head start in AI, investing $1 billion in ChatGPT developer OpenAI in 2019. The company has since increased that investment significantly and now boasts a 49% stake in the start-up. Microsoft's partnership with OpenAI has granted it access to some of the most advanced AI models, giving it an edge over rivals like Amazon and Alphabet."", ""The Windows company has used OpenAI's technology to bring AI upgrades across its product lineup. Its cloud platform, Azure, has expanded its range of AI tools, search engine Bing has been improved with ChatGPT-like features, and various Office productivity services now promise to boost efficiency with the help of AI."", 'Meanwhile, Microsoft has delivered impressive quarterly earnings. In the first quarter of 2024 (ending September 2023), the company posted revenue growth of 13% year over year, beating Wall Street forecasts by nearly $2 billion. Gains came from considerable growth in its productivity and cloud-related segments, which saw revenue increase by 13% and 19%, respectively.', 'As the home of brands like Windows, Office, Azure, Xbox, and LinkedIn, Microsoft has a massive user base. Millions of businesses rely on its software, presenting considerable earning opportunities in AI.', 'AMD and Microsoft have solid outlooks in AI over the long term. AMD looks poised to shake up the chip market with the launch of its new GPU. Meanwhile, Microsoft has the tech and brand loyalty to become the go-to for anyone looking to integrate AI into their workflow.', 'However, the charts below suggest AMD might have more stock growth potential over the next two fiscal years.', ""These tables compare AMD's and Microsoft's EPS estimates for the next two fiscal years. According to the data, AMD's earnings could hit $5 per share by fiscal 2026, while Microsoft's will likely reach $15 per share. On the surface, Microsoft looks like a no-brainer."", ""Yet multiplying those figures by AMD's forward price-to-earnings ratio of 55 and Microsoft's 34 yields stock prices of $275 and $510, respectively. Looking at their current positions, AMD's share would rise 87% and Microsoft's 36% over the next two fiscal years."", 'As a result, AMD looks like the better AI stock right now and an attractive buy at the start of 2024.', 'Should you invest $1,000 in Advanced Micro Devices right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Advanced Micro Devices, consider this:', ""The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Advanced Micro Devices wasn't one of them.

Bravo -- aiming to buy and hold great companies over many years is a terrific way to build wealth."", 'Here are three portfolio candidates presented for your consideration. Each has a strong track record of growth, plus plenty of potential for further growth. If any intrigue you, dig into them further.', 'Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) needs little introduction. It\'s a massive technology powerhouse -- its recent market value was $2.8 trillion -- with a wide variety of operations. In its first quarter of its fiscal 2024, it collected $24.3 billion from its ""Intelligent Cloud"" segment, which features the widely used Azure cloud computing platform -- with revenue growing by 19% year over year.', 'Its ""Productivity and Business Process"" division includes what might be Microsoft\'s most well-known offering: its Microsoft 365 suite of productivity software (think Word, Excel, Outlook, etc.). This segment grew by 13% to $18.6 billion. There\'s much more to Microsoft, too, such as its devices, Xbox, and LinkedIn operations -- not to mention its recently acquired Activision Blizzard business.', ""The company's future is promising, too, with Microsoft already active in artificial intelligence, offering its Microsoft Copilot service, and some suggest that it might add anywhere from $25 billion to $100 billion in revenue within a few years."", 'Intuitive Surgical (NASDAQ: ISRG) is a giant (recent market value: $119 billion) in robotic-assisted surgery. More than 8,200 of its da Vinci systems are installed in 70-plus countries, on which more than 13 million procedures have been performed -- 1.8 million in 2022 alone.', ""Intuitive's business model is quite attractive. The price tag for each of its da Vinci systems is quite high -- generally more than $1 million or much more -- meaning that it doesn't sell lots of them per day. But it makes a lot of its income via accessories, supplies, and servicing of those systems. Indeed, 79% of its revenue is from such offerings, and that's recurring revenue, the best kind!"", ""Intuitive's third quarter featured procedures growing by 19% year over year, and the installed base of da Vinci systems growing by 13%. Revenue rose by 12%, with net income up 28%. It's reasonable to expect Intuitive Surgical to keep growing at a decent clip for the foreseeable future -- due to new kinds of procedures that will be able to be performed with its system over time, and new systems being introduced."", ""The Invesco Nasdaq 100 ETF (NASDAQ: QQQM) isn't a stock -- it's an exchange-traded fund (ETF). ETFs are stock-like funds that typically encompass many holdings of various kinds. The Invesco Nasdaq 100 ETF is an index fund that is based on the Nasdaq 100 Index and describes itself like this:"", 'The Fund will invest at least 90% of its total assets in the securities that comprise the Index. The Index includes securities of 100 of the largest domestic and international nonfinancial companies listed on Nasdaq. The Fund and Index are rebalanced quarterly and reconstituted annually.', ""The beauty of this ETF is that with just one investment you'll immediately be invested in 100 of the biggest non-financial companies on the Nasdaq stock exchange -- names such as Apple, Microsoft, Amazon.com, Facebook parent Meta Platforms, Tesla, Nvidia, Google parent Alphabet, and Costco Wholesale. If you expect such companies to grow over the coming years and/or decades, this ETF is worth considering."", ""These three investment ideas look quite solid and are probably ones you can buy and hold for many years, being well-rewarded over that period. But no business is 100% bullet-proof, so if you buy, plan to check in on their progress regularly to make sure they're remaining healthy and promising."", 'And always remember: If the idea of studying and investing in individual stocks seems too daunting, you can always do very well just by sticking with broad, low-fee index funds that track the S&P 500.', 'Should you invest $1,000 in Microsoft right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Microsoft, consider this:', ""The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Microsoft wasn't one of them.

But following a strong 2023, it recovered nearly all of that lost ground.', 'The index is on the cusp of setting a new record high, which would mark the official beginning of a new bull market. It only needs a gain of 0.5% to get there.', ""History suggests 2024 will likely be another positive year for the stock market, which would practically guarantee the S&P 500 enters bull territory. With that in mind, here's why investors might want to begin the year with shares of the world's two largest companies: Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) and Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL)."", ""Microsoft was founded in 1975 as a software company, and it went public in 1986 valued at $777 million. After expanding into hardware, gaming, cloud computing, and artificial intelligence (AI) over the last 48 years, Microsoft amassed a valuation of $2.8 trillion. It trails only Apple for the title of world's largest company."", 'That significant value creation prompted Microsoft to execute nine stock splits since 1987 to ensure its shares remained accessible to small investors -- who might be grateful right now, considering it soared 57% in 2023, doubling the return of the S&P 500. And 2024 could be another strong year as the company ramps up efforts to monetize its growing portfolio of AI products.', 'Management started 2023 with a bang when it agreed to invest $10 billion in top generative AI start-up OpenAI, which is responsible for the ChatGPT chatbot. Microsoft has since embedded that technology into its Windows operating system, Edge internet browser, Bing search engine, Microsoft 365 document suite, and Azure cloud computing platform.', ""Azure OpenAI Service allows businesses to access OpenAI's latest GPT-4 models to help them build their own AI applications. The service started calendar year 2023 with just 200 customers, but within nine months, over 18,000 organizations had signed up. I anticipate that number will grow significantly this year as businesses race to embed AI into their operations to boost efficiency."", 'Microsoft is also running an early-access program for its ChatGPT-powered Copilot technology in Microsoft 365 applications. Now, businesses can harness the power of AI in Word, Excel, PowerPoint, Outlook, and Teams for $30 per employee, per month. The company says 40% of the Fortune 500 companies are participating in the early-access program, including giants like Visa and KPMG.', 'According to Statista, over 1.3 million companies use Microsoft 365, so the ability to charge them more for AI-enabled versions could be a seismic financial opportunity.', ""Microsoft's fiscal 2024 will end on June 30 this year. Wall Street analysts estimate the company will deliver $243 billion in revenue, an increase of 14.8% year over year. Its earnings per share are expected to jump 14.5% to $11.24."", ""It places the stock at a forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 33.5, which is a slight premium to the Nasdaq-100 technology index. However, the company's presence in AI might still warrant further gains. Leading Wall Street technology analyst Dan Ives at Wedbush recently named Microsoft as his top pick, and he thinks the stock could hit $450 in 2024 thanks to AI. That implies an upside of almost 20%."", 'Apple was founded in 1976, and it went public in 1980 valued at $1.8 billion. It now generates that much in revenue every 40 hours, and it became the first company in history to amass a $3 trillion valuation.', 'Like Microsoft, it has created so much value that its management executed five stock splits since 1987 to keep its shares accessible to small investors.', ""The catalyst behind the bulk of Apple's market value is the iPhone, which was introduced in 2007. It has taken consumers on a journey packed with innovation, like the smartphone's high-resolution displays, its camera technology, and its app ecosystem. But the latest iPhone 15 lineup sets the stage for what could be the next big value creator: on-device artificial intelligence."", ""The iPhone 15 is fitted with the Apple-designed A17 Pro processor, which is the smartphone industry's first 3-nanometer chip. Simply put, the brain of the iPhone is now smaller, faster, and more efficient than ever."", 'Its neural engine, which processes AI and machine-learning workloads, delivers a twofold performance boost over its predecessor, the A16 Bionic. That allows the iPhone to manage AI workloads independently of the cloud or third-party computing services, which many AI applications currently rely upon.', 'It will open the door to powerful advancements in features like the Siri voice assistant, predictive text, and Visual Lookup -- a camera tool capable of identifying faces, plants, and even famous landmarks.', ""However, Apple is rumored to be working on its own large language models and even a generative AI application called Apple GPT. Details remain scarce, but imagine having a ChatGPT-style tool woven throughout every aspect of your iPhone, processed using the device's own chip hardware. The possibilities will be endless; it could craft your messages and emails, or even create image and video content for you."", ""AI isn't the only area in which Apple is innovating. It's gearing up to launch its new virtual reality headset, the Vision Pro, in the early part of this year. It's priced at $3,499, so it probably won't sell in high volumes initially, but it's Apple's first new product category since it launched its watch in 2015. It gives developers an opportunity to build new gaming and entertainment experiences, which could attract consumers to this new platform."", ""Wall Street estimates Apple will generate $396 billion in revenue in fiscal 2024 (ending Sept. 30, 2024), which would mark a gain of just 3.5% year over year. While it sounds sluggish, there's an even bigger force likely to keep Apple stock afloat: The company continues to return truckloads of money to shareholders. It bought back $77.5 billion worth of its own stock in fiscal 2023, and paid out $15 billion in dividends. That's music to the ears of its largest investors, which include Warren Buffett."", ""Apple has always been a long-term story. It isn't very agile given its enormous size; it's more like an aircraft carrier that takes time to maneuver. But 2024 will likely be one of the company's most exciting years as it lays more groundwork for its AI initiatives, and consumers interact with the Vision Pro platform at scale for the first time."", 'Should you invest $1,000 in Microsoft right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Microsoft, consider this:', ""The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Microsoft wasn't one of them.

However, that doesn't paint the full picture of an investment because it doesn't account for dividends."", ""You generally won't see dividends on a standard stock chart, but they can play a crucial role in total returns over time. The S&P 500 (SNPINDEX: ^GSPC) -- which tracks the 500 largest stocks -- is considered the primary benchmark for overall market performance as well as dividend yields."", ""The S&P 500's dividend yield isn't typically jaw-dropping at about 1.5%. Many companies in the S&P 500 have dividend yields much higher than this average, but that doesn't always make them good buys.

Dividend yields are as of Dec. 27, 2023.', ""Despite the high dividend yields of these three companies, that alone isn't a good enough reason to invest. Let's take a look at each company and see if it's worth it."", ""Altria has consistently been one of the S&P 500's highest dividend-yield stocks. The first reason is that many people have moral reservations about investing in tobacco and similar products that are deemed harmful to health, so a high dividend is meant to attract (and retain) investors."", ""The second and not-so-good reason is that Altria's stock has struggled recently, declining more than 45% since its June 2017 peak."", ""Altria's dividend isn't in danger of being reduced or canceled, but a growing concern with the company is the declining rate of U.S. adult smokers. Between 2005 and 2021, the percentage of U.S. adult population that smoked went from 21% to 11.5%, and as the biggest tobacco company in the U.S., this has a tangible effect on Altria's cigarette volume."", 'Altria has been able to offset declining volume with higher prices, but at some point, the company will need a viable long-term strategy outside of cigarettes.', ""Walgreens Boots Alliance owns the popular Walgreens drugstore chain, with thousands of locations nationwide. The company's stock fell 30% in 2023 even accounting for a strong rally in December."", ""My main concern with Walgreens Boots Alliance is its lack of profitability. In its fiscal year 2023, its revenue was $139.1 billion, up 4.8% year over year. However, it reported net losses of $3.1 billion during that span. In the past five years, Walgreens Boots Alliance's revenue increased by over 25%, but net income swung to net losses."", ""If the company doesn't turn the corner and regain profitability relatively soon, there's a chance the dividend could be slashed to relieve it from the cash drain."", 'Telecom giant Verizon has also had its fair share of recent stock price troubles, falling more than 33% in the past five years.', 'Verizon should be a top telecom company, but at some point it has to strengthen its balance sheet to put itself in a position for growth and to keep investors satisfied. The elephant in the room has been its growing long-term debt (more than $150 billion), especially amid high interest rates.', ""To stay competitive and up to date on telecom developments like 5G and emerging technologies, Verizon can't (or shouldn't, at least) drastically cut back on its capital expenditures, but dividend cuts shouldn't be off the table. That doesn't mean a dividend reduction will happen, but investors need to be aware of the risk."", ""Given the long-term uncertainty around these companies, I think investors are better off investing in an S&P 500 exchange-traded fund (ETF) like the Vanguard S&P 500 ETF (NYSEMKT: VOO) or SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (NYSEMKT: SPY) instead. It's far-fetched to think those ETFs would ever have a dividend yield remotely as high as the individual companies, but the trade-off is their stability."", ""A high dividend yield is usually good, but it can be misleading if it's not sustainable long term.

But if we were to go up above four, that seems to be a little bit of a line in the sand where economists are starting to get worried about the unemployment rate going up.

For the purpose of our article, we have chosen EPS growth as the main factor to identify high growth stocks, from a myriad of possible metrics that could have been chosen, such as revenue growth, EBITDA growth, etc. We have defined high growth company as one where analysts expect the company to grow its EPS by an average annual rate of at least 15% over the next 5 years.', 'In terms of low debt, we have picked companies that have debt to equity ratios lower than 0.50. Companies typically use debt to finance their operations or to acquire assets. Utilization of debt for business purposes can help a company add value if used correctly. Incorrect usage of debt, on the other hand, has the potential to destroy value. Some companies and some industries can take on more debt than others depending on the fundamentals.', 'Low debt on balance sheets bodes well for the future possibility of the company remaining operational through existing financial resources as well as a comparatively greater ability to raise debt, if required, in the future at competitive rates.

Better pricing, prudent underwriting, increased exposure, faster economic recovery following the pandemic and increased vaccinations should benefit MetLife Inc. MET, American International Group Inc.

Per Fitch Ratings, improved investment results, better pricing and lower claims, coupled with improved performance of personal lines, should fuel insurers' performance.The solid capital level of multiline insurers fuels merger and acquisition (M&A) activities. The 11 rate hikes made by the Fed propelled investment income as insurers are beneficiaries of a higher rate environment. However, the Fed’s indication of rate reduction this year makes us cautious."", 'About the Industry', 'The Zacks Multiline Insurance industry comprises companies that provide single insurance coverage, bundling automobile, homeowner, long-term care, and life and health insurance to individuals and businesses. The insured pays a single premium and is covered for many things through a single contract. These companies cover commercial and personal properties, automobiles, marine, livestock, aviation, personal accident, life, including permanent and term insurance, supplemental accident and health insurance, workers’ compensation, annuity products, private mortgage insurance, et al. The players also provide risk management services. Since the companies offer single insurance coverage for multiple products, customer retention is better. The insured stands to benefit from lower premium payments compared to paying individual premiums for insuring varied products.', '3 Trends Shaping the Future of the Multiline Insurance Industry', 'Diversified portfolio lowers concentration risk:\xa0 Given the nature of the business, multiline insurers’ product and service portfolios are diversified. This lowers concentration risk. Increased awareness, driving higher demand for protection products, should benefit sales and premiums of life insurance operations. Continued improvement in pricing and an increase in exposure should support premium growth. Also, per Deloitte Insights, the transition to green energy and related insurance products, as well as exposure to intangible assets, offers growth opportunities. Per Fitch Ratings, personal auto, which suffered in 2023, is likely to deliver a better performance in 2024.Merger and acquisitions:\xa0 Consolidation in the multi-line insurance industry is expected to continue as players look to diversify their operations into new business lines and geographies. Buying businesses along the same lines is driven by the players’ need to gain a fair market share and grow in their niche areas. The M&A environment, which slowed down in the first half of 2023, regained some pace in the second half. M&As are expected to gain momentum in 2024. \xa0Increased adoption of technology: Digitalization has increased by leaps and bounds. The industry is witnessing greater use of technology like blockchain, AI, advanced analytics, telematics, cloud computing and robotic process automation to expedite business operations and save costs.\xa0 Many life insurers are selling policies online that appeal to the tech-savvy population. At the same time, the use of real-time data is making premium calculation easier and reducing risk. The P&C industry, in particular, also witnessed the emergence of insurtech — technology-led insurers — sparking competition for incumbent players. Insurers remain focused on ramping up data and analytics capabilities as well as realizing the benefit of the technological infrastructure per Deloitte Insights. Moreover, the adoption of technology has helped in seamless underwriting and claims processing. With the usage of generative AI on the rise, operations are poised for scale up. However, the adoption of technology comes with the risk of cyber threats.', 'Zacks Industry Rank Indicates Bright Prospects', 'The group’s Zacks Industry Rank, which is basically the average of the Zacks Rank of all the member stocks, indicates encouraging prospects in the near term.

However, rather than focusing on a financial multiple such as sales or earnings, market research specialist Agency Reviews targeted profit per employee.', 'According to its list of high-efficiency stocks, in the fiscal year ended March 31, “the world’s top 500 companies collectively raked in a staggering $41 trillion in revenue, yielding a formidable $2.9 trillion in profit.”', 'With a workforce over 700 million people, the average profit per employee comes out to $41,300. However, some enterprises are much more efficient on a per-worker basis and that might translate to superior long-term performance.', 'InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips', 'Now, as with any metric such as price-earnings or price-to-sales ratios, you must be careful about assigning too much weight into a single gauge. Further, it’s difficult to make comparisons across sectors due to different fundamentals. As well, not all companies posting net losses should be presumed to be inefficient laggards.', 'Nevertheless, this fresh framework provides an interesting comparison between closely related peers. On that note, below are high-efficiency stocks based on profit per employee.', 'Source: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock.com', 'What it is: A multinational corporation engaged in hydrocarbon exploration and production (upstream), ConocoPhillips (NYSE:COP) might seem to be losing its pertinence due to the political and ideological winds favoring green energy initiatives. However, the world continues to run on fossil fuels.', 'Relevance: According to Agency Reviews, ConocoPhillips lands as number one in terms of high-efficiency stocks. In fiscal year 2022, the company posted net income of $18.7 billion. At the same time, it boasted a workforce of 9,500 employees. These figures yield a profit per employee of $1.97 million. It’s easily the powerhouse in the energy sector, thus warranting a closer look.', 'Pros: Notably, ConocoPhillips also prints a three-year revenue growth rate of 28.4%, blowing past nearly 81% of its rivals. It also features a price/earnings-to-growth (PEG) ratio of 0.53X, lower than the sector median 0.92X.', 'Cons: Recent sales performances have dipped conspicuously so investors need to be cautious of outside pressures impacting hydrocarbon players.', 'Source: askarim / Shutterstock', 'What it is: A company that needs no introduction because you probably use its products on a daily basis, Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) stands alone as a consumer technology giant. And while it’s not nearly as efficient as energy players based on profit per employee, it is the most efficient among non-energy, non-government-associated enterprises.', 'Relevance: Per Agency Reviews, Apple lands at number 13 in terms of employee-focused high-efficiency stocks. Apple posted net income of $99.8 billion in FY 2022 (ended September). At the time, it boasted a workforce of 164,000 people. Therefore, its profit per employee came out to $609,000. It also helps that consumers can’t get enough of Apple-branded smart devices.', 'Pros: Despite being a mature idea among high-efficiency stocks, it continues to print an impressive three-year revenue growth rate of 15.7%. As well, Apple enjoys robust margins across the board. Unsurprisingly, it’s consistently profitable.', 'Cons: If there’s something to nitpick, AAPL runs rich multiples. For example, it trades at a lofty 29.33X forward earnings.', 'Source: Casimiro PT / Shutterstock.com', 'What it is: A home construction company, D.R. Horton (NYSE:DHI) and the rest of the industry has been in the crosshairs of economists and various market pundits. With low interest rates driving intense demand for real estate, sales blossomed for D.R. Horton. However, the combo of high inflation and high borrowing costs imposes an ambiguous cloud over the business.', 'Relevance: While many questions exist about DHI, it’s notable for its standing as one of the high-efficiency stocks. Per the market research specialist, the company lands at number 16. In FY 2022 (ended September), the homebuilder posted net income of nearly $5.9 billion. At the time, it had 13,237 people on its payroll. That yields a profit per employee of $443,000.', 'Pros: So long as the housing shortage fuels buyer demand, DHI seemingly stands on solid ground. It’s been on a blistering run since late October.', 'Cons: Despite the encouraging rally, DHI may impose bag-holding concerns if economic headwinds sideline would-be buyers.', 'Source: Jer123 / Shutterstock.com', 'What it is: Founded in 1919, American International Group (NYSE:AIG) is a multinational finance and insurance corporation. Per its public profile, it features operations in more than 80 countries and jurisdictions. While not the most exciting enterprise, AIG commands a pertinent business that may be able to negotiate turbulent waters.', 'Relevance: Perhaps an oddball name that many investors wouldn’t think of as belonging to a list of high-efficiency stocks, AIG secured the number-17 slot. At the end of fiscal 2022, the company posted net income of $10.3 billion. During that snapshot, the company carried a workforce of 26,200 people. That yielded a profit per employee of $392,000. Significantly, it stands out among financial businesses.', 'Pros: Currently, AIG runs a three-year EBITDA growth rate of 25%, beating out nearly 81% of rivals. Also, it enjoys an above average net margin of 8.14%.', 'Cons: It could use some work in the balance sheet, particularly its high debt level compared to cash.', 'Source: photobyphm / Shutterstock.com', 'What it is: A multinational pharmaceutical and biotechnology firm, Pfizer (NYSE:PFE) already ranked among the top players in the industry. However, it truly soared to prominence thanks to its efforts in forwarding a Covid-19 vaccine. Unfortunately for stakeholders, faded fears of the SARS-CoV-2 virus led to a severe erosion of equity value.', 'Relevance: One possible avenue for success is that Pfizer could leverage its technologies to advance new therapeutics and vaccines. While that’s a speculative proposition, what’s a sure thing is that the company posted net income of $31.4 billion in 2022. With a workforce of 83,000, Pfizer’s profit per employee came out to $378,000. Therefore, it’s easily one of the high-efficiency stocks within the broader healthcare umbrella.', 'Pros: PFE is also significantly undervalued on paper. For instance, shares trade at only 8.78X forward earnings, far lower than the sector median 14.53X.', 'Cons: Pfizer’s relevance needs to come to the forefront soon because of severe market erosion.', 'Source: izzuanroslan / Shutterstock.com', 'What it is: A company that revolutionized the entertainment media landscape, Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) initially started off as a platform enabling convenient consumption of content. Later, it helped popularize the concept of on-demand video via streaming. Now, the company is also known for its groundbreaking original content.', 'Relevance: Along with dominating the entertainment industry and shifting paradigms within the ecosystem, Netflix also has the distinction of being one of the high-efficiency stocks. In 2022, the company posted net income of $4.5 billion. At the time, it had 12,800 employees on its payroll, yielding a $351,000 profit per employee. That’s only going to make its media rivals even more jealous.', 'Pros: While Netflix has endured challenges due to competitive pressures, it’s still a top-tier performer. For example, its three-year revenue growth rate clocks in at 16.2%, beating out 84% of its peers. And it’s consistently profitable.', 'Cons: Given the dominance of the company, NFLX doesn’t come cheap, priced at nearly 31X forward earnings.', 'Source: Ascannio / Shutterstock.com', 'What it is: Leveraging the largest social media network in the world, Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) is – if we assume no catastrophic implosion – permanently relevant thanks to Facebook. With over 3 billion monthly active users (MAUs), the network represents a big data goldmine. As well, Meta has transitioned into a tech juggernaut.', 'Relevance: While it’s not the most heralded tech enterprise when it comes to high-efficiency stocks, Meta more than holds its own. In 2022, the company posted net income of $23.2 billion. At the time, it featured a headcount of 86,482 on its payroll. These metrics yielded a profit per employee of $268,000, landing it on the number 24 spot.', 'Pros: Meta continues to impress onlookers, particularly with a three-year revenue growth rate of 20.6%. That stat ranks better than 70.13% of companies in the interactive media space. Also, it features robust operating and net margins.', 'Cons: META isn’t overly expensive but it’s not cheap, priced at 31.3X trailing-year earnings.', 'On the date of publication, Josh Enomoto did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.\xa0The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com\xa0Publishing Guidelines.', 'Musk’s “Project Omega” May Be Set to Mint New Millionaires.

The maiden production is the film ""Good Grief,"" which Levy wrote, directed and stars in. It follows his character, Marc, whose life is turned upside down when his husband ,Oliver, played by Luke Evans, dies suddenly in an accident. Marc must reconstruct his life with the help of his two best friends, Thomas, played by Himesh Patel, and Sophie, portrayed by Ruth Negga. The movie, which starts streaming on Netflix on Jan. 5, is a drama which Levy hopes his fans will connect with even though it is outside the comedic work for which he is known. ""I think it\'s very rare to be given an opportunity to do something so different from what people know you to do and that takes a leap of faith from, in this case, from Netflix to greenlight something that\'s so different,"" Levy said. He feels that actors often get type-cast and must stay in the genre people expect them to be, so he is grateful for the chance to do something personal to him.

The first stage is generally a higher growth period which levels off heading towards the terminal value, captured in the second 'steady growth' period. In the first stage we need to estimate the cash flows to the business over the next ten years. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period.

The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Phillips 66 as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 8.6%, which is based on a levered beta of 1.284. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole.

The introduction of the Inflation Reduction Act (“IRA”) 2022 will support the industry’s transition toward clean energy sources to produce electricity. Utilities are also focused on strengthening the grid as well as transmission and distribution infrastructure. The huge infrastructure of the utilities faces the impact of the hurricane season each year. Infrastructure enhancement around the year increases the resilience of the entire system, reduces outages and allows operators to restore power quickly for customers affected by storms.NextEra Energy Inc. NEE, with its expanding clean power generation portfolio and expanding customer base, renewable operations and well-chalked-out capital investments to strengthen infrastructure, offers an excellent opportunity to stay invested in the utility space. Other utilities worth adding to your portfolio are Consolidated Edison Inc. ED, CenterPoint Inc. CNP and NRG Energy Inc. NRG.', 'About the Industry', 'The Utility – Electric Power industry involves the generation, transmission, distribution, storage and sale of electricity to customers. A substantial portion of utilities’ earnings is generated from regulated operations. Unless there is any major weather variation, demand for the services provided by utilities remains steady, regardless of economic cycles.\xa0 A very hot summer and cold winter season increases demand for electricity. A clear transition is evident in this industry, with more companies declaring zero-emission goals. Research and development over the years have resulted in a substantial decline in the cost of setting up utility-scale renewable power projects, aiding in reducing emissions. The possibility of an interest rate cut announcement from the Fed in 2024 is going to be a tailwind for capital-intensive utilities.', '3 Electric Power Industry Trends to Watch Out For', 'Transition Toward Cleaner Sources to Generate Power:\xa0 The operators in the U.S. electric power sector are gradually moving toward cleaner sources of energy. Per the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA), the annual share of U.S. electricity generation from renewable energy sources will rise from 21% in 2022 to 24% in 2024 as a result of the continuing addition of solar and wind-generating capacity. The passage of the IRA will support and accelerate the utilities’ transition toward clean energy sources. It has removed the uncertainties relating to federal incentives provided for the use of renewable sources. The act entails an opportunity for a wide range of low-cost clean energy solutions in a predictable way for a long time and will create earnings visibility. Per EIA, solar and wind generation together in 2024 will overtake electric power generation from coal for the first year ever, exceeding coal by nearly 90 billion kilowatt-hours (kWh).', 'Demand and Price for Electricity Stable: Per EIA, electricity supply volumes in the United States will increase 2.4% in 2024 from the 2023 level. A major portion of the electricity will be generated from clean energy sources.EIA predicts the price of electricity to U.S. residential customers in 2024 to average 15.8 cents per kWh, about the same as in 2023, as reduced generation costs are offset by increases in distribution and transmission costs. EIA expects retail electricity prices in the commercial and industrial sectors for 2024 to be relatively unchanged from 2023. The stability in prices and demand are going to boost the prospects of the utilities.Possibility of Interest Rate Decline is a Tailwind: Utilities, in order to maintain, upgrade and expand operations, approach capital markets for loans. The utilities have been enjoying near-zero interest rates for the past few years. However, multiple rate hikes by the Federal Reserve took the benchmark rate to the 5.25-5.50% range, which impacted the utility operators. However, in its last three meetings in 2023, the Fed did not increase the benchmark rate and indicated the possibility of rate cuts in 2024. The likely drop in interest rates in 2024 will be a positive for the utility operators as these companies are planning to invest large amounts in infrastructure upgrades and the addition of renewable sources of energy to produce electricity.', 'Zacks Industry Rank Indicates Bright Prospects', 'The group’s Zacks Industry Rank, which is basically the average of the Zacks Rank of all the member stocks, indicates strong near-term prospects.

The much-anticipated acknowledgment of a decelerating inflation trend lifted the leading benchmark indices and took them closer to all-time highs. This, in turn, hastened the plunge of 10-year Treasury yield from above 5% in late October to less than 3.9% by year-end 2023.The November non-farm payrolls report further showed that the jobless rate fell to 3.7% from 3.9% in the prior month. The economy added 199,000 jobs compared with 150,000 job additions in October, signifying economic strength. The consumer price index was up 3.1% in November on a year-over-year basis and 0.1% month over month. The latest GDP data also revealed that the economy grew in the third quarter at a stronger-than-forecast annual rate of 5.2%.As investors employ a wait-and-see approach in a classic example of “backing and filling” in the market, they can benefit from “cash cow” stocks that garner higher returns.

The S&P 500 soared 24%, while the Nasdaq rocketed 43%. Some stocks enjoyed even better performances.', 'However, there were some notable laggards. Several top dividend stocks underperformed last year, and because of that, they look like great buys this month. In particular, NextEra Energy (NYSE: NEE), Brookfield Infrastructure (NYSE: BIPC)(NYSE: BIP), and Realty Income (NYSE: O) stand out as top buys for income investors in January. They offer higher-yielding payouts that should continue growing in 2024 and beyond. ', ""NextEra Energy's stock price tumbled more than 27% in 2023 -- a sell-off that came even though the leading clean energy-focused utility was having another strong year. Its adjusted earnings per share were up 10.8% through the third quarter, putting the company on track to achieve its full-year forecast. Management also reaffirmed its view that it expected earnings to be toward the upper end of the long-term growth target range of 6% to 8% annually through 2026. That optimism came despite some issues with its affiliate, NextEra Energy Partners, which had to slow its dividend growth rate due to the impact of higher interest rates. "", ""Due to its share price slump, NextEra Energy's dividend yield has risen to over 3%. That's around double the S&P 500's average dividend yield today. That's a nice starting point for such an excellent dividend stock. The company has increased its payouts annually for more than a quarter century, growing them at an 11% compound annual rate during the last decade. "", ""NextEra should have plenty of power to continue pushing its payouts higher. It currently expects to increase its dividend by around 10% through at least this year. Meanwhile, it has lots of visibility into its earnings growth through 2026. It should also have lots of fuel to continue growing after that, given the world's tremendous need to continue investing in clean energy in the decades ahead to reduce carbon emissions. "", 'Shares of Brookfield Infrastructure slumped more than 9% in 2023. That decline pushed its dividend yield up to 4.3%.', ""Brookfield Infrastructure had another good year in 2023. Based on its outlook for the final quarter, it expects its funds from operations (FFO) per share to grow by more than 10% for the year. That's a continuation of the company's strong growth rate over the last decade (11% compound annual FFO per share growth and 9% compound annual dividend growth). "", ""Meanwhile, Brookfield is in a strong position to continue growing its earnings and dividend in 2024 and beyond. It closed several acquisitions toward the end of last year (a leading container leasing company and three data center platforms), giving it lots of momentum heading into 2024. On top of that, it has a strong organic growth profile driven by elevated inflation and several near-term expansion projects (Heartland Petrochemical Complex, its investments in Intel's semiconductor manufacturing complexes, and several data center development projects). These catalysts could drive double-digit annual FFO per share growth in the near term. That would easily support Brookfield's expectations of delivering 5% to 9% annual dividend growth over the long term. "", ""Realty Income's stock also slumped about 9% last year. That drove the dividend yield of the real estate investment trust (REIT) up to 5.3%."", 'The REIT slipped even though 2023 was another solid year of steady growth. The company was on track to acquire $9 billion of real estate last year. Those deals and rising rental rates pushed its adjusted FFO per share up by more than 4% year-over-year in the third quarter. That steady growth enabled the REIT to raise its monthly payouts five times last year. ', ""Realty Income has already gotten a head start on growing in 2024. It agreed to buy fellow REIT Spirit Realty in a $9.3 billion deal. The company expects the acquisition to increase its adjusted FFO by more than 2.5% this year. Meanwhile, the combined company is expected to generate over $800 million in post-dividend free cash flow in 2024. It anticipates reinvesting this cash flow into new income-generating real estate to push its growth rate into its 4% to 5% annual target range without raising any additional equity capital. There's upside to that growth rate if the REIT raises equity capital to fund additional investments. Given the visibility it has into its growth, Realty Income should have no problem increasing its dividend, which it has done 123 times since its public market listing in 1994. "", 'With their share prices slumping last year, NextEra Energy, Brookfield Infrastructure, and Realty Income offer even more attractive dividend yields to start 2024. Meanwhile, all three companies appear poised to continue increasing their dividends this year. That makes them stand out as some of the top income stocks to buy in January.', 'Should you invest $1,000 in NextEra Energy right now?', 'Before you buy stock in NextEra Energy, consider this:', ""The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and NextEra Energy wasn't one of them.

The introduction of the Inflation Reduction Act (“IRA”) 2022 will support the industry’s transition toward clean energy sources to produce electricity. Utilities are also focused on strengthening the grid as well as transmission and distribution infrastructure. The huge infrastructure of the utilities faces the impact of the hurricane season each year. Infrastructure enhancement around the year increases the resilience of the entire system, reduces outages and allows operators to restore power quickly for customers affected by storms.NextEra Energy Inc. NEE, with its expanding clean power generation portfolio and expanding customer base, renewable operations and well-chalked-out capital investments to strengthen infrastructure, offers an excellent opportunity to stay invested in the utility space. Other utilities worth adding to your portfolio are Consolidated Edison Inc. ED, CenterPoint Inc. CNP and NRG Energy Inc. NRG.', 'About the Industry', 'The Utility – Electric Power industry involves the generation, transmission, distribution, storage and sale of electricity to customers. A substantial portion of utilities’ earnings is generated from regulated operations. Unless there is any major weather variation, demand for the services provided by utilities remains steady, regardless of economic cycles.\xa0 A very hot summer and cold winter season increases demand for electricity. A clear transition is evident in this industry, with more companies declaring zero-emission goals. Research and development over the years have resulted in a substantial decline in the cost of setting up utility-scale renewable power projects, aiding in reducing emissions. The possibility of an interest rate cut announcement from the Fed in 2024 is going to be a tailwind for capital-intensive utilities.', '3 Electric Power Industry Trends to Watch Out For', 'Transition Toward Cleaner Sources to Generate Power:\xa0 The operators in the U.S. electric power sector are gradually moving toward cleaner sources of energy. Per the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA), the annual share of U.S. electricity generation from renewable energy sources will rise from 21% in 2022 to 24% in 2024 as a result of the continuing addition of solar and wind-generating capacity. The passage of the IRA will support and accelerate the utilities’ transition toward clean energy sources. It has removed the uncertainties relating to federal incentives provided for the use of renewable sources. The act entails an opportunity for a wide range of low-cost clean energy solutions in a predictable way for a long time and will create earnings visibility. Per EIA, solar and wind generation together in 2024 will overtake electric power generation from coal for the first year ever, exceeding coal by nearly 90 billion kilowatt-hours (kWh).', 'Demand and Price for Electricity Stable: Per EIA, electricity supply volumes in the United States will increase 2.4% in 2024 from the 2023 level. A major portion of the electricity will be generated from clean energy sources.EIA predicts the price of electricity to U.S. residential customers in 2024 to average 15.8 cents per kWh, about the same as in 2023, as reduced generation costs are offset by increases in distribution and transmission costs. EIA expects retail electricity prices in the commercial and industrial sectors for 2024 to be relatively unchanged from 2023. The stability in prices and demand are going to boost the prospects of the utilities.Possibility of Interest Rate Decline is a Tailwind: Utilities, in order to maintain, upgrade and expand operations, approach capital markets for loans. The utilities have been enjoying near-zero interest rates for the past few years. However, multiple rate hikes by the Federal Reserve took the benchmark rate to the 5.25-5.50% range, which impacted the utility operators. However, in its last three meetings in 2023, the Fed did not increase the benchmark rate and indicated the possibility of rate cuts in 2024. The likely drop in interest rates in 2024 will be a positive for the utility operators as these companies are planning to invest large amounts in infrastructure upgrades and the addition of renewable sources of energy to produce electricity.', 'Zacks Industry Rank Indicates Bright Prospects', 'The group’s Zacks Industry Rank, which is basically the average of the Zacks Rank of all the member stocks, indicates strong near-term prospects.

Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperforms the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.The industry’s positioning in the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries is a result of a positive earnings outlook for the constituent companies in aggregate.

Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: JPMorgan Chase & Co. JPM, Wells Fargo & Co. WFC and Bank of New York Mellon Corp. BK.', 'Here are highlights from Friday’s Analyst Blog:', ""The year 2023 started on a promising note as the Federal Reserve raised the interest rates to a 15-year high range of 4.25-4.50% in the previous year to control 'sticky' inflation. The higher interest rate regime propelled the banks' top-line growth in 2022."", ""However, as higher interest rates hurt bond values, many banks with notable portfolios of bond investments were affected. Hence, as the year progressed, the fallout from the central bank's ultra-aggressive monetary policy started emerging. Moreover, increasing funding costs, potential recession, asset-liability mismatches, high exposure to fixed-rate mortgage loans, commercial real estate loans and uninsured deposits on the balance sheet resulted in the regional banking crisis in early March with the fall of three large banks, Silicon Valley Bank, Signature Bank and First Republic Bank. These lenders were part of the S&P 500 Index."", 'Such challenges turned investors bearish toward the banking stocks. As the ultra-aggressive pace of rate hikes turned counterproductive for banks that generally perform well in the higher interest rate regime, the Fed pausing the interest rate hike at the June FOMC meeting helped regain some confidence in bank stocks.', 'Now, at the end of the two-day FOMC meeting earlier this month, the Fed signaled an end to rate hikes this cycle. In fact, the central bank is now expected to cut rates thrice in 2024. With this, bank stocks navigated choppy waters and investors gradually turned optimistic toward banks.', ""So far this year, the S&P Banks Select Industry Index has risen 3.5%, lagging the S&P 500 Index's rally of 25.1%. Today, we will discuss the three best-performing S&P 500 banks, JPMorgan Chase & Co., Wells Fargo & Co. and Bank of New York Mellon Corp. or BNY Mellon."", ""Before we proceed to check out these three top-performing banks in detail, let's see how they have fared."", 'JPMorgan Chase: This banking behemoth tapped an opportunity to strengthen its balance sheet amid turbulence in the banking space. JPMorgan acquired First Republic Bank, the third largest bank to collapse in 2023, for $10.6 billion in an FDIC-assisted deal.', ""Following the transaction, JPMorgan's balance sheet has swelled to almost $3.9 trillion. The deal resulted in increased penetration within the high-net-worth clients and added prime locations in wealthy markets."", ""While high interest rates hindered net interest income (NII) for numerous banks on higher funding costs, First Republic Bank's acquisition drove robust improvement in JPM's NII. In the nine months ended Sep 30, 2023, the company's NII jumped 40% to $65.2 billion."", 'Given the encouraging momentum, JPMorgan kept on raising its 2023 NII outlook. It expects 2023 NII to be roughly $88.5 billion, up from the prior guidance of $87 billion. The increase is driven by higher rates and slower-than-expected deposit repricing across both consumers and wholesale.', 'Coming to investment banking (IB) activities, despite the muted deal-making scenario, JPMorgan continued to rank #1 for global IB fees with an 8.6% wallet share in the first nine months of 2023. The company is seeing encouraging signs in the IB business, which is likely to rebound and grow at a decent pace once the macroeconomic and geopolitical ambiguity is over. Improvement in the macro scenario, along with a healthy IB pipeline and active merger & acquisition (M&A) market, will likely facilitate IB fee growth.', ""Also, JPMorgan Chase's efforts to embrace new technologies and make investments in fintech companies are positive."", ""Lastly, the company increased its dividend by 5% to $1.05 per share in 2023 and announced its intention to repurchase shares worth $12 billion this year. This, too, is likely to have driven investors' confidence in the stock."", ""The stock has gained 26.9% this year. The company's earnings are projected to witness a year-over-year rise of 38.4% this year on 22.9% growth in revenues. It currently has a Zacks Rank of 3 (Hold)."", 'Wells Fargo: Operating with an asset cap that is limiting balance-sheet growth, WFC has made impressive efforts in regard to expense management. Efforts such as streamlining organizational structure, closing branches, and reducing headcount undertaken from third-quarter 2020 have been aiding expense reduction.

Historical data suggests that strong annual performances often extend into the following year, attributed to momentum and solid fundamentals. LPL Research data from 1950 reveals that years following a 20% or more gain in the S&P 500 tend to see an average rise of 10%, with a higher likelihood of positive outcomes. Analysts project a favorable outlook for 2024, with expectations of continued momentum, a target range for the S&P 500, and positive indicators such as a record high and historical patterns in election years. However, the market's strength will face tests, including upcoming corporate earnings reports and signals from the Federal Reserve's monetary policy meeting. While historical trends provide guidance, analysts acknowledge the need for flexibility in assessing the market's trajectory. Jared Bernstein, a key supporter of President Biden's economic agenda, stated that the strains on US consumer spending, like increasing credit card delinquency rates, indicate a return to pre-pandemic debt levels, reported Bloomberg. Despite a rise in consumer debt, Bernstein highlighted wealth gains, job market strength, and increased real wages in 2023 as signs of progress from the inflation surge affecting Biden's approval ratings. While credit card balances grew, Bernstein noted that it reflects a return to normal levels rather than a ballooning issue. He emphasized that Americans are in good shape regarding debt servicing, with a 3.7% rise in disposable income supporting consumer spending. Looking ahead, the White House aims to focus on lowering costs, building on progress made in areas like healthcare and reducing fees."", ""The interest rate on the most prevalent type of U.S. home loan has experienced a notable downtrend, marking its ninth consecutive weekly decline and reaching the lowest level since May, as indicated by data released by Freddie Mac on December 28. Specifically, the 30-year fixed-rate mortgage averaged 6.61%, showing a decline from the previous week's rate of 6.67%, reported Reuters. This sustained drop in interest rates comes on the heels of a peak in late October, when rates hit their highest level in 22 years. Over this period, rates have plummeted by a substantial 1.18 percentage points. This trend reversal is noteworthy, especially considering the trajectory of mortgage rates during 2022. Amidst the Federal Reserve's robust campaign to curb inflation, mortgage rates surged after having dipped below 3% during the peak of the COVID-19 pandemic. However, the recent signaling by the Federal Reserve that it has concluded its rate-hiking strategy and is likely to initiate rate reductions in 2024 has spurred a significant shift. This change in sentiment has triggered a year-end rally in bond markets, influencing the yields on the 10-year Treasury note—a crucial factor in determining mortgage rates. Notably, these yields have decreased to below 4%, a marked contrast from the levels around 5% observed in late October. The bond market's reaction to the Federal Reserve's stance has contributed to the favorable environment for homeowners, potentially signaling a period of more affordable borrowing costs in the housing market.

Even though stock market corrections, bear markets, and even crashes are a normal and inevitable part of the investing cycle, all three major stocks indexes are trending higher over the long run.', 'However, not all of the major indexes have reached new highs. While the ageless Dow Jones Industrial Average managed to eclipse its old closing high, the broad-based S&P 500 and growth-driven Nasdaq Composite failed to do so in 2023. For investors with cash at the ready and a long-term mindset, it means bargains can still be found.', 'Arguably the best aspect of putting your money to work on Wall Street is that most online brokerages have done away with investment barriers. Specifically, commission fees on stock trades and minimum deposit requirements are (mostly) a thing of the past. This means any amount of money -- even $1,000 -- can be the ideal amount to invest.', ""If you have $1,000 that's ready to be put to work, and you're absolutely certain this isn't cash you'll need to pay bills or cover emergencies as they arise, the following three stocks stand out as no-brainer buys for the new year."", 'The first genius stock to buy with $1,000 in 2024 is none other than leading payments processor Visa (NYSE: V).', ""The worst thing that can be said about Visa is that it's a cyclical business. When recessions occur, it's not uncommon for consumers and businesses to pare back their spending."", 'At the moment, a couple of money-based metrics and forecasting tools portend the growing likelihood of a U.S. recession in 2024. Should an economic downturn take shape, it would likely be bad news for most financial stocks.', ""However, Visa is the perfect example of a company that benefits from optimism and patience. Though we can never predict when recessions will occur, we do know they're historically short-lived. Only three of the 12 recessions following World War II have lasted at least 12 months, with none surpassing 18 months."", ""By comparison, most economic expansions are multiyear events. This allows Visa's fee collection to grow in lockstep with the U.S. (and global) economy over time."", ""Visa's growth runway is vast, as well. Based on Securities and Exchange Commission filings from the four major U.S. payment processors, Visa gobbled up a nearly 53% share of credit card network purchase volume in 2021."", ""It's also staring down a multidecade opportunity to expand its payment infrastructure into underbanked regions of the world, including the Middle East, Africa, and Southeast Asia. Whether it's derived from organic growth, bolt-on acquisitions, or some combination of the two, Visa can sustain double-digit earnings growth for as far as the eye can see."", ""Another reason investors shouldn't be worried about Visa is the company's operating model. Specifically, management has steered clear of lending and has remained solely focused on payment facilitation."", ""The advantage of this strategy is not having to directly contend with loan losses. Since Visa isn't a lender, it's not required to set capital aside to cover potential delinquencies. That's a competitive edge that allows it to bounce back from economic downturns faster than its peers."", ""With nearly 14% annualized earnings growth expected over the next five years, Visa's stock remains inexpensive at 23 times forward-year earnings."", 'A second no-brainer stock to buy with $1,000 right now is healthcare conglomerate Johnson & Johnson (NYSE: JNJ), commonly referred to as J&J.', 'The primary reason J&J performed so poorly in 2023, relative to the major stock indexes, has to do with litigation overhanging the company. Johnson & Johnson is facing approximately 100,000 lawsuits that allege its now-discontinued talcum-based baby powder causes cancer. J&J offered to settle these suits in court, but had its settlement attempts thrown out on two occasions.', ""Wall Street isn't a big fan of uncertainty, and there's always the possibility of a final judgment topping the $8.9 billion J&J had offered via settlement."", ""On the other hand, Johnson & Johnson is one of the most operationally stable companies on the planet. It does business in a highly defensive sector where demand doesn't change much from one year to the next. Since we don't have the luxury of choosing when we get sick or what ailment(s) we develop, juggernauts like J&J can count on predictable cash flow every year."", ""Furthermore, Johnson & Johnson is one of only two publicly traded companies that hold a coveted AAA-credit rating from Standard & Poor's, whose parent is the more-familiar S&P Global. J&J has generated north of $20 billion in operating cash flow over the trailing year, and it's sitting on more than $23 billion in cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities. If the company owes money because of litigation, it won't have any trouble paying it."", ""J&J's success is also a function of continuity at key leadership positions. A person needs only the fingers on both hands to count how many CEOs J&J has had since its founding in 1886. The lack of a carousel in the executive suite ensures that key strategic initiatives are being properly implemented."", 'Speaking of important initiatives, J&J continues to focus on developing pharmaceuticals. While brand-name drugs have finite periods of exclusivity, they provide J&J with exceptional margins and growth potential.', ""The cherry on top is that Johnson & Johnson's forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 14.6 is a decade low and makes it one heck of a bargain for patient investors."", 'The third no-brainer stock to buy with $1,000 right now for the new year is leading fintech company PayPal Holdings (NASDAQ: PYPL).', 'Shares of PayPal have tumbled roughly 80% since the midpoint of 2021 on the heels of rising competition in the digital payment space, as well as an above-average rate of inflation. Higher inflation is a concern for transaction-driven businesses like PayPal because it threatens to reduce the discretionary spending power of low-earning workers.', 'However, PayPal has been able to successfully navigate a challenging environment with little impact to many of its key performance indicators. For instance, total payment volume (TPV) on its digital networks continues to grow by a double-digit percentage, sans currency movements. As the U.S. and global economy expand over time, the company should enjoy sustained growth in TPV.', 'To add to the above, digital payment adoption is still in its early innings. The analysts at Boston Consulting Group estimate the global fintech market will sextuple to $1.5 trillion annually by the turn of the decade.', ""But what really makes PayPal special is its user engagement statistics. As recently as the end of 2020, the average active account was completing nearly 41 transactions over the trailing-12-month (TTM) period. But as of the company's latest quarter (ended Sept. 30), the number of transactions per average active account had grown to almost 57 over the TTM. PayPal's digital networks are primarily driven by fees, meaning higher engagement is a pathway to an increase in gross profit."", ""Current and prospective investors should also be excited about the hire of Alex Chriss as CEO, which became effective on Sept. 27. Chriss came from Intuit, where he was the executive vice president and general manager of the company's Small Business and Self-Employed Group. Not only is he the perfect hire to enhance PayPal's small business ambitions, but he also understands how to pull the right levers to reduce expenses and bolster the company's margins."", ""On top of expected cost-cutting, PayPal's board hasn't been shy about putting cash to work via buybacks. Management noted that share repurchases in 2023 were expected to reach approximately $5 billion. When coupled with cost reductions, this is a formula for higher earnings per share."", 'Lastly, PayPal is historically cheap. Shares can be purchased for 11 times forward-year earnings, which is its lowest forward-year multiple since becoming a publicly traded company.', 'Should you invest $1,000 in Visa right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Visa, consider this:', ""The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Visa wasn't one of them.

Management expects that the current cash balance, combined with the initial $130 million payments from J&J, will help MeiraGTx fund its business operations into mid-2026.

The step down was ""indicative of further softening ... as companies and consumers deal with the effects of sustained higher interest rates and recessionary fears,"" according to Gershwind on the company\'s earnings call in October.', 'The weakness in its end markets is evident from the slowdown in manufacturing sales in its fourth quarter (ended Sep. 2).', 'The company has already reported September average daily sales growth of 1.3%, and management estimated average daily sales growth of 1%-2% in October. So we know the first quarter of 2024 (comprising September, October, and November) will be weak. The real question is what management will say about the cadence of growth in November, December, and the start of January.', ""Investors have reason for optimism because MSC Industrial was negatively impacted by the United Auto Workers strike in 2023, and there may well be a bounce back in sales.

It's particularly relevant to follow in a period of interest rate volatility, where you might expect rising load defaults to impact the economy negatively."", ""One way to keep an eye on matters is to monitor non-performing loan rates at Wells Fargo. Non-performing loans mean a borrower has failed to meet a scheduled repayment. As you can see below, based on data from Wells Fargo, the consumer (and the residential mortgage market portion of consumer borrowing) appears to be in good shape. Interest rates started rising significantly at the start of 2022, which hasn't caused significant stress in the mortgage market yet."", ""It's a different story in the commercial real estate market, though, notably in the office sector. However, this is probably also a consequence of workers' greater willingness to work remotely."", 'Suppose Wells Fargo reports similarly favorable conditions in the residential debt markets in the fourth quarter. Investors would then have reason to be optimistic about the housing market in 2024, especially if interest rates decline later in the year. On a more negative note, the commercial real estate market is an ongoing watch item.', ""In the residential housing market, Whirlpool is a company worth following closely. While Wells Fargo's non-performing loans in the residential mortgage market are doing fine, it doesn't mean housing market-related spending is doing fine, too. After all, mortgage rates are higher, so monthly payments also will rise."", 'CEO Mark Bitzer talked of ""solid"" demand in America in the third quarter, driven by ""very strong replacement demand"" as appliances were heavily used. However, Bitzer noted that the ""other side of demand discretionary purchases have been even softer than anticipated as a result of increased mortgage rates and low consumer confidence.""', ""This kind of outlook led to Whirlpool lowering its full-year earnings guidance to $16 from a range of $16-$18 previously.\xa0That said, there's a strong case for buying Whirlpool as a high-yield play for 2024 based on both its potential to recover as interest rates fall and the results of its cost-cutting plan fall into its margin.

Even though stock market corrections, bear markets, and even crashes are a normal and inevitable part of the investing cycle, all three major stocks indexes are trending higher over the long run.', 'However, not all of the major indexes have reached new highs. While the ageless Dow Jones Industrial Average managed to eclipse its old closing high, the broad-based S&P 500 and growth-driven Nasdaq Composite failed to do so in 2023. For investors with cash at the ready and a long-term mindset, it means bargains can still be found.', 'Arguably the best aspect of putting your money to work on Wall Street is that most online brokerages have done away with investment barriers. Specifically, commission fees on stock trades and minimum deposit requirements are (mostly) a thing of the past. This means any amount of money -- even $1,000 -- can be the ideal amount to invest.', ""If you have $1,000 that's ready to be put to work, and you're absolutely certain this isn't cash you'll need to pay bills or cover emergencies as they arise, the following three stocks stand out as no-brainer buys for the new year."", 'The first genius stock to buy with $1,000 in 2024 is none other than leading payments processor Visa (NYSE: V).', ""The worst thing that can be said about Visa is that it's a cyclical business. When recessions occur, it's not uncommon for consumers and businesses to pare back their spending."", 'At the moment, a couple of money-based metrics and forecasting tools portend the growing likelihood of a U.S. recession in 2024. Should an economic downturn take shape, it would likely be bad news for most financial stocks.', ""However, Visa is the perfect example of a company that benefits from optimism and patience. Though we can never predict when recessions will occur, we do know they're historically short-lived. Only three of the 12 recessions following World War II have lasted at least 12 months, with none surpassing 18 months."", ""By comparison, most economic expansions are multiyear events. This allows Visa's fee collection to grow in lockstep with the U.S. (and global) economy over time."", ""Visa's growth runway is vast, as well. Based on Securities and Exchange Commission filings from the four major U.S. payment processors, Visa gobbled up a nearly 53% share of credit card network purchase volume in 2021."", ""It's also staring down a multidecade opportunity to expand its payment infrastructure into underbanked regions of the world, including the Middle East, Africa, and Southeast Asia. Whether it's derived from organic growth, bolt-on acquisitions, or some combination of the two, Visa can sustain double-digit earnings growth for as far as the eye can see."", ""Another reason investors shouldn't be worried about Visa is the company's operating model. Specifically, management has steered clear of lending and has remained solely focused on payment facilitation."", ""The advantage of this strategy is not having to directly contend with loan losses. Since Visa isn't a lender, it's not required to set capital aside to cover potential delinquencies. That's a competitive edge that allows it to bounce back from economic downturns faster than its peers."", ""With nearly 14% annualized earnings growth expected over the next five years, Visa's stock remains inexpensive at 23 times forward-year earnings."", 'A second no-brainer stock to buy with $1,000 right now is healthcare conglomerate Johnson & Johnson (NYSE: JNJ), commonly referred to as J&J.', 'The primary reason J&J performed so poorly in 2023, relative to the major stock indexes, has to do with litigation overhanging the company. Johnson & Johnson is facing approximately 100,000 lawsuits that allege its now-discontinued talcum-based baby powder causes cancer. J&J offered to settle these suits in court, but had its settlement attempts thrown out on two occasions.', ""Wall Street isn't a big fan of uncertainty, and there's always the possibility of a final judgment topping the $8.9 billion J&J had offered via settlement."", ""On the other hand, Johnson & Johnson is one of the most operationally stable companies on the planet. It does business in a highly defensive sector where demand doesn't change much from one year to the next. Since we don't have the luxury of choosing when we get sick or what ailment(s) we develop, juggernauts like J&J can count on predictable cash flow every year."", ""Furthermore, Johnson & Johnson is one of only two publicly traded companies that hold a coveted AAA-credit rating from Standard & Poor's, whose parent is the more-familiar S&P Global. J&J has generated north of $20 billion in operating cash flow over the trailing year, and it's sitting on more than $23 billion in cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities. If the company owes money because of litigation, it won't have any trouble paying it."", ""J&J's success is also a function of continuity at key leadership positions. A person needs only the fingers on both hands to count how many CEOs J&J has had since its founding in 1886. The lack of a carousel in the executive suite ensures that key strategic initiatives are being properly implemented."", 'Speaking of important initiatives, J&J continues to focus on developing pharmaceuticals. While brand-name drugs have finite periods of exclusivity, they provide J&J with exceptional margins and growth potential.', ""The cherry on top is that Johnson & Johnson's forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 14.6 is a decade low and makes it one heck of a bargain for patient investors."", 'The third no-brainer stock to buy with $1,000 right now for the new year is leading fintech company PayPal Holdings (NASDAQ: PYPL).', 'Shares of PayPal have tumbled roughly 80% since the midpoint of 2021 on the heels of rising competition in the digital payment space, as well as an above-average rate of inflation. Higher inflation is a concern for transaction-driven businesses like PayPal because it threatens to reduce the discretionary spending power of low-earning workers.', 'However, PayPal has been able to successfully navigate a challenging environment with little impact to many of its key performance indicators. For instance, total payment volume (TPV) on its digital networks continues to grow by a double-digit percentage, sans currency movements. As the U.S. and global economy expand over time, the company should enjoy sustained growth in TPV.', 'To add to the above, digital payment adoption is still in its early innings. The analysts at Boston Consulting Group estimate the global fintech market will sextuple to $1.5 trillion annually by the turn of the decade.', ""But what really makes PayPal special is its user engagement statistics. As recently as the end of 2020, the average active account was completing nearly 41 transactions over the trailing-12-month (TTM) period. But as of the company's latest quarter (ended Sept. 30), the number of transactions per average active account had grown to almost 57 over the TTM. PayPal's digital networks are primarily driven by fees, meaning higher engagement is a pathway to an increase in gross profit."", ""Current and prospective investors should also be excited about the hire of Alex Chriss as CEO, which became effective on Sept. 27. Chriss came from Intuit, where he was the executive vice president and general manager of the company's Small Business and Self-Employed Group. Not only is he the perfect hire to enhance PayPal's small business ambitions, but he also understands how to pull the right levers to reduce expenses and bolster the company's margins."", ""On top of expected cost-cutting, PayPal's board hasn't been shy about putting cash to work via buybacks. Management noted that share repurchases in 2023 were expected to reach approximately $5 billion. When coupled with cost reductions, this is a formula for higher earnings per share."", 'Lastly, PayPal is historically cheap. Shares can be purchased for 11 times forward-year earnings, which is its lowest forward-year multiple since becoming a publicly traded company.', 'Should you invest $1,000 in Visa right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Visa, consider this:', ""The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Visa wasn't one of them.

The three primary stock market indices logged an astounding surge toward the end of the year, repeatedly hitting record highs."", 'This impressive performance has been driven by a surge in technology stocks, a decrease in inflationary pressures, and the growing belief that the Federal Reserve has concluded its interest rate hikes. The talks are doing rounds that the Fed may cut rates by 75 bps by the end of 2024.', 'Among these indices, the Nasdaq Composite has turned out as the top performer, scoring a gain of 44.3%. In the same period, the S&P 500 has climbed by 24.5%, while the Dow Jones Industrial has advanced by 13.6%.

In fact, it's a rare divergence when the two don't have a similar strategy when it comes to the automotive industry."", 'But that rare divergence happened when Ford severely scaled back its homegrown driverless vehicle ambitions (and took a big $2.7 billion charge on Argo AI) while General Motors appeared to double down on its Cruise driverless vehicle.', ""Given the recent Cruise headaches, was Ford right all along? And more importantly, what does it mean for Ford's investors?"", 'Cruise was the first company to start commercial driverless rides in San Francisco in the summer of 2022, and problems surfaced almost immediately. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration initiated a probe on two incidents when Cruise vehicles hit pedestrians and other incidents when Cruise vehicles interfered with emergency responders. Then the California Department of Motor Vehicles suspended Cruise\'s permits for driverless testing and deployment, calling them ""unsafe."" Amid the onslaught of negative publicity, Kyle Vogt, who co-founded Cruise in 2013, resigned as CEO in November 2023.', ""Let's not forget that right as California suspended Cruise's permits, the company was planning an ambitious expansion. It had launched smaller-scale operations in Phoenix, Arizona, and Austin, Texas, with preparations for a dozen more locations and even rumors of entering Tokyo."", 'Cruise slashed almost 25% of its full-time workforce and fired nine executives in the middle of December. After a complete leadership overhaul, it was fair for investors to question not only the future of Cruise but whether or not rival Ford had been right all along.', ""Let's rewind to the end of 2022, when Ford bucked the unmistakable buzz surrounding General Motors' Cruise ambitions, and gave up on developing its own fully autonomous driving technology with Argo AI -- a move that cost the company $2.7 billion in impairment charges."", ""At the time, Ford simply admitted to investors that bringing level 4 advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS) to the market profitably wasn't feasible anytime soon. Management remained confident there was indeed a future for the technology, just that Ford didn't need to spend significant resources to create that technology."", ""Ford decided to refocus its efforts on level 2 and level 3 systems, which don't completely cut out the human driver, to better provide customers with premium services and offer investors better profitability."", ""In fairness, General Motors has been doing a lot of things right over the past 15 years, since the 2008-09 Great Recession and financial crisis brought the company to its knees. But when bitter rivals that generally focus on similar strategies choose opposite paths on such a big development, investors should be asking a lot more questions. As I noted back in 2022, Ford's move to scale back its driverless car efforts should be a warning sign for General Motors."", ""So far, General Motors is saying the right things for long-term investors. The company is refocusing Cruise on safety, and it reassured investors it has the capital to continue funding Cruise, which has lost more than $8 billion since 2016. GM even boasted a bit, claiming not only to back Cruise's turnaround efforts but also to increase its dividend by 33%. It also announced a $10 billion share buyback program."", ""For investors, keeping an eye on Cruise will be an important component of any investing thesis. It could be one reason GM makes investors rich over the next two decades, or it could be a profitable black hole for a decade, leaving investors wondering why GM didn't follow Ford's lead here."", ""Stay tuned. It's sure to be an interesting ride."", 'Should you invest $1,000 in Ford Motor Company right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Ford Motor Company, consider this:', ""The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Ford Motor Company wasn't one of them.

Among the plug-ins, we're seeing the good old Chrysler Pacifica minivan. That gets the full credit for a plug-in. You see cars like the Lincoln Corsair. And the Jeep Wranglers, Jeep Grand Cherokees, that are plug-ins, but also on the EV, pure EV, side a few Teslas like the Model 3 Performance, Model Y, and the Model X long-range. And then, also, the Bolt EV, the F-150 Lightning, and the Rivians that you mentioned, that's it for the EVs."", ""JULIE HYMAN: So what's not?"", ""PRAS SUBRAMANIAN: You're losing the Nissan Leaf, Volkswagen ID.4, the cheapest version of the Model 3, and also the Ford Mustang Mach-E, which is actually a pretty big sell-- one of the top sellers of EVs in the country. So those are some big ones that are being gone. Those manufacturers say they're going to retool how they make the batteries and hopefully get those back into the regime of federal tax credits.

Each has a strong track record of growth, plus plenty of potential for further growth. If any intrigue you, dig into them further.', 'Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) needs little introduction. It\'s a massive technology powerhouse -- its recent market value was $2.8 trillion -- with a wide variety of operations. In its first quarter of its fiscal 2024, it collected $24.3 billion from its ""Intelligent Cloud"" segment, which features the widely used Azure cloud computing platform -- with revenue growing by 19% year over year.', 'Its ""Productivity and Business Process"" division includes what might be Microsoft\'s most well-known offering: its Microsoft 365 suite of productivity software (think Word, Excel, Outlook, etc.).

If you expect such companies to grow over the coming years and/or decades, this ETF is worth considering."", ""These three investment ideas look quite solid and are probably ones you can buy and hold for many years, being well-rewarded over that period.

Its buyouts will also aid growth. The company’s capital deployment activities are backed by strong liquidity. However, pressure on mortgage income due to high rates and a lack of diversification in its loan portfolio are headwinds for Regions Financial. Rising non-interest expenses may impede bottom-line growth.', 'Regions Financial’s NII witnessed a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 8.5% over the last three years (2019-2022), with the uptrend continuing in the first nine months of 2023. The improvement in NII was driven by higher interest rates and solid average loan balance trends, partially offset by higher deposit and funding costs.', 'Over the past three years (ended 2022), the company’s total loans witnessed a CAGR of 5.2%, with loan balances increasing in third-quarter 2023 from the 2022 end. Given the company’s asset-sensitive balance sheet, high interest rates are expected to support its NII and net interest margin in the upcoming period. However, a rise in deposit costs is likely to affect both in the near term. For 2023, management expects total loans to grow in the low-single-digit range and NII to increase 11%.', 'Regions Financial is focused on expanding and diversifying its business operations on the back of investments in varied product offerings and through inorganic expansion efforts. In 2021, the company acquired Clearsight, Sabal Capital and EnerBank USA, which diversified its revenue sources. As the company is committed to diversifying its revenue streams and meeting customer needs via diverse services, we believe such endeavors will support its growth prospects in the long term.', 'Regions Financial has a solid balance sheet and liquidity position. As of Sep 30, 2023, it had long-term borrowings of $4.29 billion, whereas its liquidity sources aggregated $56.8 billion. Given a strong liquidity profile, Regions Financial is less likely to default on interest and debt repayments if the economic situation worsens. Moreover, this supports the company’s capital distribution activities.', 'In July 2023, the bank announced a 20% increase in its quarterly common stock dividend to 24 cents per share. In April 2022, Regions Financial’s board of directors announced a share repurchase program of up to $2.5 billion of common stock from second-quarter 2022 through fourth-quarter 2024. As of Sep 30, 2023, the company repurchased 725,000 shares for $15 million under this share repurchase plan. Such efforts to enhance shareholder value are encouraging.', 'However, non-interest expenses witnessed a CAGR of 5.3% over the 2019-2022 period. The rising trend continued in the first nine months of 2023. The rise was majorly due to increases in salaries and employee benefit expenses, and other expenses. Management expects 2023 adjusted non-interest expenses to increase 9.5%. A rising expense base is likely to continue negatively impacting the bottom line in the near term.', 'Regions Financial’s mortgage income, which is a key component of its non-interest income, witnessed a negative CAGR of 1.5% over the 2019-2022 period, with the declining trend continuing in the first nine months of 2023. Sparse inventories have tanked rapid house price appreciation over the past year, thus wearing down affordability in the market. Moreover, high mortgage rates are likely to continue affecting residential first mortgage loan origination volume and margins in the upcoming period, thereby impeding mortgage income.', 'Lastly, the majority of Regions Financial’s loan portfolio (57.3% as of Sep 30, 2023) comprises total commercial loans (commercial and industrial lending, as well as commercial real estate lending).

His conglomerate, Berkshire Hathaway, has grown into one of the world's largest companies, owning dozens of privately held businesses as well as stakes in an array of public corporations."", ""The Berkshire Hathaway stock portfolio is a great place to start looking for investment ideas. However, Berkshire has built that portfolio over decades, so it's not as simple as just buying what Buffett already owns."", 'However, a few Buffett stocks are hanging out at attractive valuations right now, making them potential buys to kick off the new year.', ""Credit card company American Express (NYSE: AXP) is one of Buffett's most significant and longest-tenured stock holdings. He began buying the stock in the early 1990s, and it became a core holding within a handful of years. Credit cards are a booming business in the U.S., where American Express targets a premium audience of business spenders and high earners."", ""Its long existence has also built brand power. American Express is widely recognized today, and that's proving out as wealth among Americans transfers from older generations to younger ones. American Express has noted that millennial and Gen Z customers are its fastest-growing demographics. In Q3, spending among these groups grew 18% year over year and represented 60% of new global accounts."", ""Getting traction with the younger consumers, who are becoming the critical pillars of the economy, could ensure long-term growth for the business. Analysts believe American Express's earning will increase by an average of 14% annually. At the stock's forward P/E of about 15, American Express could be considered a bargain for the brand name and expected future growth."", ""In the payments-processing industry, Visa (NYSE: V) is another top-tier financial company in the Berkshire Hathaway portfolio. Since the stock accounts for only 0.6% of the portfolio's value, one might say Buffett missed out a bit on Visa's tremendous returns. Since Berkshire first began buying shares in 2011, the stock has returned more than 1,500%, easily outpacing the broader market."", ""Unlike American Express, Visa doesn't lend money. Instead, it charges merchants fees on each transaction that crosses its payment network. Visa is simply a facilitator of transactions, and as the world's largest payment network (outside of China), and it has flourished as the world shifts away from cash."", ""Visa has grown into a $530 billion market valuation, and growth on a percentage basis must naturally slow as a company's size increases. But Visa's growth isn't over. Analysts believe the company can generate compound earnings growth of 15% annually. That's a solid deal with the stock trading at 26 times 2023 estimated earnings. Investors may find that Visa still offers some great years of returns."", ""Buffett's investments in financial stocks extend into emerging markets, too. Nu Holdings (NYSE: NU), a digital bank that serves Latin America, has fantastic long-term growth opportunities. Berkshire bought the stock shortly after its initial public offering (IPO) in late 2021. It's a low-weight position for the conglomerate, accounting for just 0.2% of the portfolio's value."", ""Nu Holdings has nearly 90 million customers in Latin America, a region with more than 660 million people. Of those, an estimated 122 million adults don't have bank accounts. Many of those potential customers are up for grabs as the region's economy develops."", ""Importantly, Nu Holdings is profitable. Based on company forecasts for the completed -- but not yet reported -- Q4, analysts expect to learn that it earned $0.22 per share in 2023. That would give the stock a price-to-earnings ratio (P/E) of 38. Earnings should expand as the company continues growing. Average estimates for 2025 are for EPS of $0.50, giving it a forward P/E of just over 16. Investors willing to hold onto the stock for a few years (or ideally, longer) should see Nu Holdings grow into its valuation and then some.

Since taking over the once-struggling textile company in 1965, Buffett and his team have generated total returns on capital 153 times greater than those of the benchmark S&P 500. He was schooled in the art of value investing from Benjamin Graham, the author of the iconic investing tome The Intelligent Investor, and subsequently adapted it to fit his style.', ""Buffett's slight modifications to Graham's quantitative, value-based investing model include a heavier emphasis on management quality, a company's competitive advantages, and more often than not, a company's dividend growth potential. Not all of Berkshire Hathaway's stock holdings pay dividends, but most of the conglomerate's largest and longest holdings are blue chip dividend payers with a long track record of regular increases to the payout."", 'Which Warren Buffett dividend stocks stand out as top buys in 2024? Due to their formidable economic moats and impressive history of dividend raises, Visa (NYSE: V) and American Express (NYSE: AXP) both screen as outstanding buys right now. Read on to find out more about these two blue chip dividend stocks.', ""Visa is a global titan in the electronic payment services industry. It is also a top 20 Berkshire stock holding, with the conglomerate's position worth about $2.16 billion at the moment."", 'Visa fits the mold of Buffett\'s investing style to a T. Speaking to this point, it has a strong competitive advantage in the electronic payment services market. The company\'s competitive moat has even been labeled as ""unassailable"" by the investment firm Morningstar. Moreover, Visa has increased its dividend payments at a remarkable compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 19.1% over the last 17 years.', ""Visa's dividend program also screens as extremely safe. It has a fairly low payout ratio of 21.7%, and the company is forecast to grow its top line by more than 31% over the next two years. Visa should thus have no problem boosting its cash distributions to shareholders in the years to come."", ""The only minor downside is that the stock's yield is only 0.8%, which is about half that of the average S&P 500-listed stock. However, Visa's stock is highly likely to continue its recent winning streak due to the ongoing shift from cash to digital payments worldwide, which should more than compensate for its low yield."", ""Berkshire has been a loyal shareholder of American Express, or Amex, since the early 1990s. Currently, the credit card and payment services company is the conglomerate's third-largest holding, after Apple and Bank of America."", 'Why has Berkshire held on to this credit card stock for so long? One likely reason is its competitive edge, which comes from its distinctive business model. Unlike other credit card issuers that rely mostly on interest income, Amex makes about 80% of its revenue from fees charged to cardholders and merchants.', 'Another reason is its loyal customer base, which consists of affluent individuals and businesses that use their cards frequently for high-dollar purchases such as travel and entertainment, generating more transaction fees for Amex.', ""As for dividends, Amex has been increasing the size of its dividend checks at a CAGR of 8.4% over the past 20 years. Although the company's yield of 1.28% is below average, it sports a low payout ratio of 26.6% and a solid revenue growth outlook for 2024 (around 9.5%). Hence, its dividend growth potential is superb, to put it mildly."", 'Keeping with this theme, Buffett noted in Berkshire\'s latest annual letter that Amex is ""highly likely"" to continue to increase its cash distributions to shareholders in the years to come.', 'Should you invest $1,000 in Visa right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Visa, consider this:', ""The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Visa wasn't one of them.

Even though stock market corrections, bear markets, and even crashes are a normal and inevitable part of the investing cycle, all three major stocks indexes are trending higher over the long run.', 'However, not all of the major indexes have reached new highs. While the ageless Dow Jones Industrial Average managed to eclipse its old closing high, the broad-based S&P 500 and growth-driven Nasdaq Composite failed to do so in 2023. For investors with cash at the ready and a long-term mindset, it means bargains can still be found.', 'Arguably the best aspect of putting your money to work on Wall Street is that most online brokerages have done away with investment barriers. Specifically, commission fees on stock trades and minimum deposit requirements are (mostly) a thing of the past. This means any amount of money -- even $1,000 -- can be the ideal amount to invest.', ""If you have $1,000 that's ready to be put to work, and you're absolutely certain this isn't cash you'll need to pay bills or cover emergencies as they arise, the following three stocks stand out as no-brainer buys for the new year."", 'The first genius stock to buy with $1,000 in 2024 is none other than leading payments processor Visa (NYSE: V).', ""The worst thing that can be said about Visa is that it's a cyclical business. When recessions occur, it's not uncommon for consumers and businesses to pare back their spending."", 'At the moment, a couple of money-based metrics and forecasting tools portend the growing likelihood of a U.S. recession in 2024. Should an economic downturn take shape, it would likely be bad news for most financial stocks.', ""However, Visa is the perfect example of a company that benefits from optimism and patience. Though we can never predict when recessions will occur, we do know they're historically short-lived. Only three of the 12 recessions following World War II have lasted at least 12 months, with none surpassing 18 months."", ""By comparison, most economic expansions are multiyear events. This allows Visa's fee collection to grow in lockstep with the U.S. (and global) economy over time."", ""Visa's growth runway is vast, as well. Based on Securities and Exchange Commission filings from the four major U.S. payment processors, Visa gobbled up a nearly 53% share of credit card network purchase volume in 2021."", ""It's also staring down a multidecade opportunity to expand its payment infrastructure into underbanked regions of the world, including the Middle East, Africa, and Southeast Asia. Whether it's derived from organic growth, bolt-on acquisitions, or some combination of the two, Visa can sustain double-digit earnings growth for as far as the eye can see."", ""Another reason investors shouldn't be worried about Visa is the company's operating model. Specifically, management has steered clear of lending and has remained solely focused on payment facilitation."", ""The advantage of this strategy is not having to directly contend with loan losses. Since Visa isn't a lender, it's not required to set capital aside to cover potential delinquencies. That's a competitive edge that allows it to bounce back from economic downturns faster than its peers."", ""With nearly 14% annualized earnings growth expected over the next five years, Visa's stock remains inexpensive at 23 times forward-year earnings."", 'A second no-brainer stock to buy with $1,000 right now is healthcare conglomerate Johnson & Johnson (NYSE: JNJ), commonly referred to as J&J.', 'The primary reason J&J performed so poorly in 2023, relative to the major stock indexes, has to do with litigation overhanging the company. Johnson & Johnson is facing approximately 100,000 lawsuits that allege its now-discontinued talcum-based baby powder causes cancer. J&J offered to settle these suits in court, but had its settlement attempts thrown out on two occasions.', ""Wall Street isn't a big fan of uncertainty, and there's always the possibility of a final judgment topping the $8.9 billion J&J had offered via settlement."", ""On the other hand, Johnson & Johnson is one of the most operationally stable companies on the planet. It does business in a highly defensive sector where demand doesn't change much from one year to the next. Since we don't have the luxury of choosing when we get sick or what ailment(s) we develop, juggernauts like J&J can count on predictable cash flow every year."", ""Furthermore, Johnson & Johnson is one of only two publicly traded companies that hold a coveted AAA-credit rating from Standard & Poor's, whose parent is the more-familiar S&P Global. J&J has generated north of $20 billion in operating cash flow over the trailing year, and it's sitting on more than $23 billion in cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities. If the company owes money because of litigation, it won't have any trouble paying it."", ""J&J's success is also a function of continuity at key leadership positions. A person needs only the fingers on both hands to count how many CEOs J&J has had since its founding in 1886. The lack of a carousel in the executive suite ensures that key strategic initiatives are being properly implemented."", 'Speaking of important initiatives, J&J continues to focus on developing pharmaceuticals. While brand-name drugs have finite periods of exclusivity, they provide J&J with exceptional margins and growth potential.', ""The cherry on top is that Johnson & Johnson's forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 14.6 is a decade low and makes it one heck of a bargain for patient investors."", 'The third no-brainer stock to buy with $1,000 right now for the new year is leading fintech company PayPal Holdings (NASDAQ: PYPL).', 'Shares of PayPal have tumbled roughly 80% since the midpoint of 2021 on the heels of rising competition in the digital payment space, as well as an above-average rate of inflation. Higher inflation is a concern for transaction-driven businesses like PayPal because it threatens to reduce the discretionary spending power of low-earning workers.', 'However, PayPal has been able to successfully navigate a challenging environment with little impact to many of its key performance indicators. For instance, total payment volume (TPV) on its digital networks continues to grow by a double-digit percentage, sans currency movements. As the U.S. and global economy expand over time, the company should enjoy sustained growth in TPV.', 'To add to the above, digital payment adoption is still in its early innings. The analysts at Boston Consulting Group estimate the global fintech market will sextuple to $1.5 trillion annually by the turn of the decade.', ""But what really makes PayPal special is its user engagement statistics. As recently as the end of 2020, the average active account was completing nearly 41 transactions over the trailing-12-month (TTM) period. But as of the company's latest quarter (ended Sept. 30), the number of transactions per average active account had grown to almost 57 over the TTM. PayPal's digital networks are primarily driven by fees, meaning higher engagement is a pathway to an increase in gross profit."", ""Current and prospective investors should also be excited about the hire of Alex Chriss as CEO, which became effective on Sept. 27. Chriss came from Intuit, where he was the executive vice president and general manager of the company's Small Business and Self-Employed Group. Not only is he the perfect hire to enhance PayPal's small business ambitions, but he also understands how to pull the right levers to reduce expenses and bolster the company's margins."", ""On top of expected cost-cutting, PayPal's board hasn't been shy about putting cash to work via buybacks. Management noted that share repurchases in 2023 were expected to reach approximately $5 billion. When coupled with cost reductions, this is a formula for higher earnings per share."", 'Lastly, PayPal is historically cheap. Shares can be purchased for 11 times forward-year earnings, which is its lowest forward-year multiple since becoming a publicly traded company.', 'Should you invest $1,000 in Visa right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Visa, consider this:', ""The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Visa wasn't one of them.

The stock market is irrational. It does silly things and can lift shares of poor businesses while punishing good ones, sometimes for reasons not apparent to the naked eye. It can take time for things to sort themselves out.', 'But you also have to acknowledge that poor businesses are often bad investments, no matter how much time you give them. U.S. telecom giant Verizon Communications (NYSE: VZ) is a household name.', ""Yet, it seems investors constantly overlook how bad the stock has been, and for how long. If you had invested $100 into Verizon in 1990, you'd have $780 today from share price growth and dividends. That sounds great -- until you find out that the S&P 500 index would have turned that same $100 into $2,733."", ""What's the reason for Verizon's shockingly poor performance, and what does it say about its future?"", ""Stocks don't just automatically go up if you wait long enough. A company must grow and create value to justify a higher share price. Verizon has grown over the years, especially over the past two decades, which saw smartphones become a must-have for nearly all Americans. Verizon's revenue has increased more than tenfold since 1990."", ""But growth alone isn't enough. Verizon's first big problem is that the company has struggled to generate much value over the years. What does that mean, value? Ideally, a business puts resources to work and generates a return -- for example, putting a dollar in and generating two dollars in return."", ""This can be scored using a company's return on invested capital. Since 1990, Verizon has returned an average of $1.07 back for each dollar it puts into the company. That's not great. It must balance expensive investments in upgrading and maintaining its network with price-conscious customers. It's a tough business."", ""A tough business requires top-notch management to stretch every dollar and make strategic decisions that add value to the company. Verizon's whiffed here, too, at times. Management has gradually loaded the balance sheet to roughly three times debt-to-EBITDA, twice as much leverage as Verizon had 10 years ago."", 'Expensive acquisitions have also seemingly missed the mark. Verizon bought prepaid phone carrier TracFone Wireless in 2020 for over $6 billion. However, Verizon has been bleeding prepaid customers, losing over a million prepaid customers over the past year. It bought AOL and Yahoo for about $9 billion between 2015 and 2017, only to sell them off at a loss in 2021.', ""Poor execution in a challenging telecom business has hurt Verizon's earnings growth, and that's the third reason the stock has trailed the market. Despite over 1,000% revenue growth since 1990, earnings per share have grown by just 280%."", ""Those optimistic over Verizon stock might point to the stock's hefty dividend and cheap valuation. After all, the current dividend yield is a whopping 7%, and shares trade at a price-to-earnings ratio of just 8 times 2023 earnings."", ""But even that can be a bad deal if the business isn't growing. Analysts believe Verizon will have virtually zero earnings growth over the coming years. In other words, Verizon's dividend is about what investors can expect for investment returns. The stock price has only risen 50% since 1990! That won't change dramatically unless Verizon can figure out how to grow its profits."", ""In other words, investors should expect more of the same. Verizon is a high-yield dividend stock that offers little else to investors. A dividend alone isn't enough, which is why Verizon has severely lagged the broader market over time. Given the muted outlook, a wireless business losing customers, and a bloated balance sheet, investors should consider looking elsewhere."", 'Should you invest $1,000 in Verizon Communications right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Verizon Communications, consider this:', ""The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Verizon Communications wasn't one of them.

However, that doesn't paint the full picture of an investment because it doesn't account for dividends."", ""You generally won't see dividends on a standard stock chart, but they can play a crucial role in total returns over time. The S&P 500 (SNPINDEX: ^GSPC) -- which tracks the 500 largest stocks -- is considered the primary benchmark for overall market performance as well as dividend yields."", ""The S&P 500's dividend yield isn't typically jaw-dropping at about 1.5%. Many companies in the S&P 500 have dividend yields much higher than this average, but that doesn't always make them good buys.

Dividend yields are as of Dec. 27, 2023.', ""Despite the high dividend yields of these three companies, that alone isn't a good enough reason to invest. Let's take a look at each company and see if it's worth it."", ""Altria has consistently been one of the S&P 500's highest dividend-yield stocks. The first reason is that many people have moral reservations about investing in tobacco and similar products that are deemed harmful to health, so a high dividend is meant to attract (and retain) investors."", ""The second and not-so-good reason is that Altria's stock has struggled recently, declining more than 45% since its June 2017 peak."", ""Altria's dividend isn't in danger of being reduced or canceled, but a growing concern with the company is the declining rate of U.S. adult smokers. Between 2005 and 2021, the percentage of U.S. adult population that smoked went from 21% to 11.5%, and as the biggest tobacco company in the U.S., this has a tangible effect on Altria's cigarette volume."", 'Altria has been able to offset declining volume with higher prices, but at some point, the company will need a viable long-term strategy outside of cigarettes.', ""Walgreens Boots Alliance owns the popular Walgreens drugstore chain, with thousands of locations nationwide. The company's stock fell 30% in 2023 even accounting for a strong rally in December."", ""My main concern with Walgreens Boots Alliance is its lack of profitability. In its fiscal year 2023, its revenue was $139.1 billion, up 4.8% year over year. However, it reported net losses of $3.1 billion during that span. In the past five years, Walgreens Boots Alliance's revenue increased by over 25%, but net income swung to net losses."", ""If the company doesn't turn the corner and regain profitability relatively soon, there's a chance the dividend could be slashed to relieve it from the cash drain."", 'Telecom giant Verizon has also had its fair share of recent stock price troubles, falling more than 33% in the past five years.', 'Verizon should be a top telecom company, but at some point it has to strengthen its balance sheet to put itself in a position for growth and to keep investors satisfied. The elephant in the room has been its growing long-term debt (more than $150 billion), especially amid high interest rates.', ""To stay competitive and up to date on telecom developments like 5G and emerging technologies, Verizon can't (or shouldn't, at least) drastically cut back on its capital expenditures, but dividend cuts shouldn't be off the table. That doesn't mean a dividend reduction will happen, but investors need to be aware of the risk."", ""Given the long-term uncertainty around these companies, I think investors are better off investing in an S&P 500 exchange-traded fund (ETF) like the Vanguard S&P 500 ETF (NYSEMKT: VOO) or SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (NYSEMKT: SPY) instead. It's far-fetched to think those ETFs would ever have a dividend yield remotely as high as the individual companies, but the trade-off is their stability."", ""A high dividend yield is usually good, but it can be misleading if it's not sustainable long term. The latter should be a main concern for investors. The S&P 500 ETF route won't let you down."", 'Should you invest $1,000 in Altria Group right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Altria Group, consider this:', ""The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Altria Group wasn't one of them.

Let's look at the reasons why investors might want to consider buying TSMC right now."", ""The AI chips that Nvidia sells are manufactured by its foundry partner TSMC, which is why TSMC seems a solid bet for investors seeking an alternative AI chip play. Shares of the Taiwan-based company jumped 40% in 2023, underperforming the PHLX Semiconductor Sector index, which clocked much stronger growth of 66%. However, that's good news for opportunistic investors, as TSMC stock is trading at a much cheaper valuation than Nvidia's."", ""TSMC sports a price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 19, which is lower than the company's five-year average P/E ratio of 22. Investors can consider buying TSMC stock hand over fist at its current valuation, as revenue and earnings growth are expected to pick up impressively in 2024. More specifically, TSMC's revenue was predicted to decline almost 9% in 2023 to $69 billion thanks to the weak demand for smartphones and personal computers (PCs). AI, however, is likely to change the picture this year."", ""As the chart above shows, TSMC is expected to post 20%-plus revenue growth rates over the next couple of years. A key reason why TSMC's growth is likely to accelerate is that the company's advanced chips, which are manufactured using 5-nanometer (nm) and 3-nm process nodes, are in strong demand from the likes of Nvidia. These advanced chips are manufactured using TSMC's advanced packaging technology, known as chip-on-wafer-on-substrate (CoWoS)."", ""Market research firm IDC estimates that CoWoS packaging capacity is expected to jump a whopping 130% in the second half of 2024. In other words, sales of TSMC's AI chips are likely to take off, as the company will be in a position to boost shipments this year and bridge the 20% demand-supply gap that currently exists in CoWoS packaging."", ""It is also worth noting that TSMC could win big from the growing adoption of its 3nm chips in the long run, as this process node is expected to help chipmakers create $1.5 trillion worth of chips over the next five years. All this explains why TSMC's bottom-line growth is set to accelerate as well."", 'Assuming TSMC does hit $7.72 per share in earnings in 2025, as the chart above indicates, and trades at its five-year average forward earnings multiple of 21.3 at that time, its stock price could reach $165 in two years. That would represent a 58% jump from current levels.', ""However, TSMC stock could jump higher if the market rewards it with a higher earnings multiple. It is worth noting that TSMC's forward earnings multiple is cheaper than the 29 average forward P/E of the Nasdaq-100 index, which can serve as a proxy for tech stocks considering that it is mostly made up of tech stocks."", ""If TSMC trades at 29 times forward earnings in a couple of years, the company's stock could jump to $224 based on projected 2025 earnings.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average, S&P 500, and Nasdaq Composite have oscillated between bear and bull markets in successive years since this decade began.', ""When volatility picks up on Wall Street, professional and everyday investors have a tendency to seek out companies that offer a history of outperformance. For the past two and a half years, it's stocks enacting splits that have fit the bill."", ""In simple terms, a stock split is an event that allows a publicly traded company to alter its share price and outstanding share count while having no impact on its market cap or operations. Think of it as a purely cosmetic procedure that can make shares more nominally affordable for retail investors (i.e., a forward-stock split), or can increase a publicly traded company's share price to ensure continued listing on a major stock exchange (i.e., a reverse stock split)."", ""While there are instances of companies conducting reverse-stock splits and going on to deliver big-time gains for their shareholders (e.g., Booking Holdings), most investors are laser-focused on companies conducting forward-stock splits. That's because forward splits are enacted by high-flying companies that have often out-innovated and handily out-executed their competition."", 'Since the midpoint of 2021, nine prominent companies have completed a forward-stock split:', 'Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA): 4-for-1 split', 'Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN): 20-for-1 split', 'DexCom (NASDAQ: DXCM): 4-for-1 split', 'Shopify (NYSE: SHOP): 10-for-1 split', 'Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOGL)(NASDAQ: GOOG): 20-for-1 split', 'Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA): 3-for-1 split', 'Palo Alto Networks (NASDAQ: PANW): 3-for-1 split', 'Monster Beverage (NASDAQ: MNST): 2-for-1 split', 'Novo Nordisk (NYSE: NVO): 2-for-1 split', ""Every single one of these businesses is a dominant player with well-defined competitive advantages in their respective industries. For example, Nvidia's graphics processing units are the infrastructure backbone of the artificial intelligence (AI) movement, Amazon accounts for roughly 40% of U.S. online retail sales, Tesla is North America's leading electric vehicle (EV) manufacturer, and DexCom is a top-two producer of continuous glucose monitoring systems."", 'However, the individual outlooks for these nine stock-split stocks differs greatly in 2024 (and beyond). Whereas one stock-split stock is historically inexpensive and primed for additional upside, another highflier appears to be headed for a breakdown.', ""Though all nine of these prominent companies have run circles around the benchmark S&P 500 over the long run, it's Alphabet that stands out as the stock-split stock to buy hand over fist in the new year. Alphabet is the parent company of popular internet search engine Google and streaming platform YouTube."", 'The biggest ""problem"" (if you want to call it that) for Alphabet is that it\'s cyclical. Approximately 78% of the company\'s third-quarter revenue is derived from advertising. When the slightest hint of trouble is detected by businesses, it\'s not uncommon for them to quickly pare back their ad spending. This leaves Alphabet susceptible to weakness during recessions. A couple of money-based metrics and predictive tools suggest an economic downturn is in the cards for 2024.', ""However, this is a two-sided coin that's far from proportionate. Though it's true that recessions are a perfectly normal and inevitable part of the economic cycle, only three of the 12 recessions since the end of World War II have lasted at least 12 months. Further, not a single one has surpassed 18 months."", 'By comparison, most economic expansions endure multiple years, with two periods of post-World-War-II growth lasting more than a decade. In short, ad-driven businesses are well positioned to succeed as the U.S. economy expands.', ""Alphabet's clearest competitive advantage has long been its search engine, Google. In November, Google totaled 91.54% of worldwide search share, according to data from GlobalStats. You'd have to go back to March 2015 to find the last month Google hasn't accounted for at least 90% of global internet search share. Being the undisputed go-to for advertisers wanting to reach users has afforded the company exceptional ad-pricing power in virtually any economic climate. This moat isn't going away in 2024."", ""The new year should also feature double-digit growth opportunities for two of Alphabet's fast-growing ancillary segments. YouTube is the second most visited social site in the world, with more than 2.7 billion monthly active users. Rapid growth in Shorts (short-form videos often lasting less than 60 seconds) should put ad-pricing power in YouTube's corner."", ""There's also Google Cloud, which has gobbled up a 10% share of worldwide cloud infrastructure service spending, based on estimates from Canalys, as of the third quarter. Enterprise cloud spending still has a long growth runway, and Google Cloud looks to have made the permanent shift to recurring profitability."", ""Despite sustained double-digit earnings growth potential over the next five years (if not well beyond), Alphabet stock can be purchased for roughly 14 times estimated cash flow per share in 2024. That's a 20% discount to its average multiple to cash flow over the past five years."", 'To quote the most famous investment disclaimer on Wall Street: ""Past performance is no guarantee of future results."" Although EV maker Tesla has made a habit of proving naysayers wrong for more than a decade, it\'s the clear stock-split stock to avoid in 2024 for a variety of reasons.', ""Before digging into those reasons, allow me to give credit where credit is due. As of right now, Tesla is the only pure-play EV manufacturer that's profitable on a recurring basis. While there are other profitable automakers, none of the legacy companies are generating a recurring profit from their electric-only divisions. When Tesla reports its fourth-quarter operating results, I'd expect it to wrap up its fourth consecutive year of generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) profit."", ""Unfortunately for the world's largest automaker by market cap, its first-mover advantages are beginning to wane, and there are very evident cracks in its foundation."", 'The most front-and-center evidence that Tesla is in trouble can be seen via its operating margin, which has been more than halved to 7.6% over the trailing year, ended Sept. 30.', ""In 2023, North America's leading EV company slashed prices on Model's 3, S, X, and Y on more than a half-dozen occasions. Based on comments provided by CEO Elon Musk during the company's annual shareholder meeting in May, these price cuts were based solely on demand. With vehicle inventory levels rising, it's plainly evident that demand for the company's EVs has declined. It also suggests that additional price cuts may be necessary to keep inventory levels under control as Tesla continues to ramp up its production."", ""Another potential problem with Tesla is how it's deriving its income. During the third quarter, Tesla booked $554 million in profit from selling renewable energy credits given to it for free by governments. It also generated $282 million in interest income from its sizable cash pile. That's $836 million in pre-tax income -- 41% of the company's pre-tax income in the third quarter -- that can be traced back to unsustainable sources."", ""Although Elon Musk is a big reason Tesla has been such a success since going public in 2010, he's also a genuine liability for shareholders. Putting aside that he's drawn the attention of securities regulators on a couple of occasions, his biggest flaw is that he regularly overpromises new innovations (including new EVs) and fails to deliver them. Tesla's enormous valuation looks to be based on countless promises from Musk that remain unfulfilled."", ""Lastly, Tesla's efforts to become more than a car company have mostly missed the mark. Its ancillary segments generate low margins, while auto margins continue to fall. Whereas most auto stocks trade between 6 and 8 times forward-year earnings, Tesla is valued at 65 times consensus earnings in 2024. That's not a valuation that's going to hold up in the face of a rapidly declining operating margin."", 'Should you invest $1,000 in Alphabet right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Alphabet, consider this:', ""The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Alphabet wasn't one of them.

Last quarter, Abbot demonstrated its resilience with a slight increase in net income to $ 1.45 billion—up just 0.1 % over the previous year (or down one-half of that amount when adjusted for special items). This comes when revenue has dipped slightly, by about 2.6%, to $10.14 billion for the year. Aging population stocks have been a key focus of Abbott’s efforts because the demographic changes underway also change consumer expectations.', 'Innovations like the Aveir Leadless Pacemaker testify to Abbott’s determination to face aging-related health problems. This is a major step forward in cardiac care technology tailored to the requirements of elderly patients. In addition, Abbott is making headway with spinal cord stimulation systems, which ease chronic pain, a problem common for elderly people.', 'In addition, Abbott’s focus on muscle health reflects its all-around approach to aging. Aware of the natural loss of muscle that begins around age 40, Abbott urges preventive care through its product line. This worked well with the increasing demand for products and services geared to an aging population.', 'With its combination of technological innovation and lifestyle solutions, Abbott’s position in the market is very strong.

However, net income did take a hit, decreasing by about 30% to $832 million.', 'Humana’s balance sheet presents a solid footing, with cash and short-term investments escalating to over $30 billion, a 14% uptick. Total assets climbed to $55.91 billion, reflecting a healthy 10% growth. Yet, this expansion comes with an uptick in liabilities, now at $38.90 billion, a 13% rise. The cash flow statements paint a nuanced picture, with a striking 85% decline in cash from operations, signaling potential areas for efficiency improvements.', 'Humana’s strategic initiatives, such as expanding Conviva’s primary care network and addressing digital isolation among seniors, showcase its commitment to capitalizing on the aging population. Its dedication is evident in its actions, from enhancing healthcare access to embracing digital solutions. These efforts position Humana as a healthcare provider and proactive entity in the evolving senior care landscape.

Given that stock prices are usually aligned with a company's financial performance in the long-term, we decided to study its financial indicators more closely to see if they had a hand to play in the recent price move. Particularly, we will be paying attention to F5's  ROE today."", ""Return on equity or ROE is an important factor to be considered by a shareholder because it tells them how effectively their capital is being reinvested. Put another way, it reveals the company's success at turning shareholder investments into profits."", ' See our latest analysis for F5 ', 'ROE can be calculated by using the formula:', ""Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' Equity"", 'So, based on the above formula, the ROE for F5 is:', '14% = US$395m ÷ US$2.8b (Based on the trailing twelve months to September 2023).', ""The 'return' is the amount earned after tax over the last twelve months. So, this means that for every $1 of its shareholder's investments, the company generates a profit of $0.14."", 'We have already established that ROE serves as an efficient profit-generating gauge for a company\'s future earnings. We now need to evaluate how much profit the company reinvests or ""retains"" for future growth which then gives us an idea about the growth potential of the company. Assuming all else is equal, companies that have both a higher return on equity and higher profit retention are usually the ones that have a higher growth rate when compared to companies that don\'t have the same features.', ""To start with, F5's ROE looks acceptable. On comparing with the average industry ROE of 8.7% the company's ROE looks pretty remarkable. Needless to say, we are quite surprised to see that F5's net income shrunk at a rate of 7.7% over the past five years. Therefore, there might be some other aspects that could explain this. For example, it could be that the company has a high payout ratio or the business has allocated capital poorly, for instance."", ""However, when we compared F5's growth with the industry we found that while the company's earnings have been shrinking, the industry has seen an earnings growth of 32% in the same period. This is quite worrisome."", ""Earnings growth is a huge factor in stock valuation. The investor should try to establish if the expected growth or decline in earnings, whichever the case may be, is priced in. Doing so will help them establish if the stock's future looks promising or ominous. Is F5 fairly valued compared to other companies? These 3 valuation measures might help you decide."", ""F5 doesn't pay any dividend, meaning that potentially all of its profits are being reinvested in the business, which doesn't explain why the company's earnings have shrunk if it is retaining all of its profits. It looks like there might be some other reasons to explain the lack in that respect. For example, the business could be in decline."", ""On the whole, we do feel that F5 has some positive attributes. Yet, the low earnings growth is a bit concerning, especially given that the company has a high rate of return and is reinvesting ma huge portion of its profits. By the looks of it, there could be some other factors, not necessarily in control of the business, that's preventing growth. With that said, we studied the latest analyst forecasts and found that while the company has shrunk its earnings in the past, analysts expect its earnings to grow in the future.

If you'd like, you can check out the forecasts from the analysts covering Oracle here  for free."", ""Things have been pretty stable at Oracle, with its capital employed and returns on that capital staying somewhat the same for the last five years. This tells us the company isn't reinvesting in itself, so it's plausible that it's past the growth phase. So don't be surprised if Oracle doesn't end up being a multi-bagger in a few years time."", ""In a nutshell, Oracle has been trudging along with the same returns from the same amount of capital over the last five years. Investors must think there's better things to come because the stock has knocked it out of the park, delivering a 136% gain to shareholders who have held over the last five years. But if the trajectory of these underlying trends continue, we think the likelihood of it being a multi-bagger from here isn't high."", ""Like most companies, Oracle does come with some risks, and we've found 1 warning sign  that you should be aware of."", ""While Oracle may not currently earn the highest returns, we've compiled a list of companies that currently earn more than 25% return on equity.

It has already sparked an arms race among the world's largest technology companies to provide leading data center infrastructure to their business customers. Plus, enterprises of all sizes are finding new ways to embed AI applications into their everyday operations to boost productivity."", 'Depending which Wall Street estimate you rely upon, AI could add anywhere between $7 trillion and $200 trillion to the global economy over the next decade. That will create enormous investment opportunities.', ""Speaking of enormous investing opportunities, Oracle (NYSE: ORCL) and Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) have created many stock millionaires already for those smart enough (or lucky enough) to buy in on their previous growth. Here's how these two companies could ride the AI boom to mint even more going forward."", 'Oracle has been one of the most innovative technology companies in the world since its founding in 1977, when it launched its original database management software. Today, it plays a pivotal role in helping companies transition into the digital age. It offers a portfolio of cloud-based applications designed to improve efficiency for dozens of different industries, with the help of automation and AI.', ""But investors' attention is currently focused on Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI), which delivers critical computing infrastructure to its business customers so they can design, build, and deploy their own cloud-based applications. However, OCI is now tackling its most lucrative opportunity ever: artificial intelligence."", ""Oracle's data center infrastructure is powered by Nvidia's leading graphics processing chips (GPUs), and it has become a top destination for developers of generative AI applications. Chairman Larry Ellison says Oracle's GPU cluster technology can train AI models at twice the speed and half the cost of competing clouds. As a result, it has attracted leading AI start-ups like Adept AI, Cohere, and even Elon Musk's xAI."", ""In the recent fiscal 2024 second quarter (ended Nov. 30), Oracle's cloud infrastructure revenue came in at $1.6 billion. While that was a small piece of the company's overall $12.9 billion in revenue, it increased by a whopping 52% year over year. Ellison says that pace of advancement will likely continue for years, and if he's right, it means cloud infrastructure revenue will more than double every two years. As a result, it could eventually become a more significant growth driver for the entire company."", ""But it might get even better because that growth is hampered by supply constraints right now. Oracle operates 66 data centers, and not only is it expanding them at the moment, but it's also building 100 more. That takes time, and the company also can't get its hands on enough Nvidia chips. In fact, Ellison said Oracle couldn't provide anywhere close to enough GPU capacity for Elon Musk's xAI venture recently, and those circumstances will lead to lost revenue (in the short term)."", ""Oracle stock has soared 229,095% since it came public in 1986, so an investment of $440 back then would be worth more than $1 million today. While that pace of growth probably won't be repeated over the next three-plus decades, Oracle is valued at just $290 billion, so it's one of the smallest of the big-tech companies and still has room for significant growth."", 'Wall Street estimates Oracle will deliver $5.55 in earnings per share during fiscal 2024, placing its stock at a forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of just 19. By comparison, competing AI cloud company Microsoft trades at a forward P/E of 33.5. Oracle stock would have to rise 76% just to catch up, without factoring in any future growth.', ""Over the long term, it's conceivable Oracle's fast-growing presence in AI will give it a chance to join its tech peers that sport trillion-dollar market capitalizations. It could take a decade (or more) while OCI grows to account for more of the company's total revenue, but it implies its stock could triple from here, so an investor starting with $300,000 today might eventually become a millionaire."", ""Amazon is an e-commerce pioneer, and online sales are still the company's largest source of revenue despite expansions into cloud computing, digital advertising, and streaming services. E-commerce has had an impact on millions of people; it saves time, it lowers prices because merchants can sell more volume, and it allows consumers to buy products from all over the world."", 'But a seismic amount of work happens behind the scenes at Amazon to deliver a great e-commerce experience for customers, and a growing amount of that work is powered by artificial intelligence. Amazon uses AI to learn what customers are likely to buy, creating a highly personalized shopping experience with targeted product recommendations. Plus, Amazon uses over 750,000 AI-powered autonomous robots in its fulfillment centers to speed up logistics, ensuring customers receive their goods in a timely manner.', 'But Amazon is also using AI extensively in its industry-leading cloud services platform, Amazon Web Services (AWS). It developed its own data center AI chips, including the new Trainium2, which is 4 times faster than its predecessor, empowering developers to accelerate the training phase of their AI models. AWS also offers a host of large language models (LLMs) to its business customers, including its own called Titan, as well as third-party models from leading start-ups like Anthropic, in which Amazon bought an equity stake worth $4 billion.', 'Simply put, AWS offers all the hardware and software businesses need to build AI applications for their own purposes.', 'The Amazon story is incredibly attractive from a value perspective. Its stock is part of the ""Magnificent Seven,"" a group of technology giants that outperformed the S&P 500 index by a wide margin in 2023. But Amazon stock is the cheapest of the group by far based on its price-to-sales (P/S) ratio.', ""Amazon is on track to deliver $570 billion in total revenue in 2023 (pending its official Q4 results). That's more than any other company in the Magnificent Seven, yet it trades at less than half the P/S valuation of the next-cheapest stock in the group, Alphabet."", ""Amazon shares have delivered a 202,486% gain since the company came public in 1997, which means an investment of just $500 back then would be worth over $1 million today. It's unlikely to repeat that rate of growth, but an investor who starts with $200,000 today could join the millionaires' club within the next 20 years so long as Amazon increases its revenue by 8.3% annually (it's on track to rise by more than 11% in both 2023 and 2024, according to Wall Street estimates)."", 'Plus, Amazon stock would have to quadruple just to trade in line with the average P/S ratio of the other six Magnificent Seven stocks, without factoring in any further revenue growth at all.', 'Should you invest $1,000 in Oracle right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Oracle, consider this:', ""The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Oracle wasn't one of them.

The Zacks Consensus Estimate -- the consensus of EPS estimates from the sell-side analysts covering the stock -- for the current and following years is tracked by the system."", 'The power of a changing earnings picture in determining near-term stock price movements makes the Zacks rating system highly useful for individual investors, since it can be difficult to make decisions based on rating upgrades by Wall Street analysts.

That's partly because of the influence of institutional investors that use earnings and earnings estimates for calculating the fair value of a company's shares. An increase or decrease in earnings estimates in their valuation models simply results in higher or lower fair value for a stock, and institutional investors typically buy or sell it. Their transaction of large amounts of shares then leads to price movement for the stock."", ""For Paccar, rising earnings estimates and the consequent rating upgrade fundamentally mean an improvement in the company's underlying business.

However, Berkshire has built that portfolio over decades, so it's not as simple as just buying what Buffett already owns."", 'However, a few Buffett stocks are hanging out at attractive valuations right now, making them potential buys to kick off the new year.', ""Credit card company American Express (NYSE: AXP) is one of Buffett's most significant and longest-tenured stock holdings.

Credit cards are a booming business in the U.S., where American Express targets a premium audience of business spenders and high earners."", ""Its long existence has also built brand power. American Express is widely recognized today, and that's proving out as wealth among Americans transfers from older generations to younger ones. American Express has noted that millennial and Gen Z customers are its fastest-growing demographics. In Q3, spending among these groups grew 18% year over year and represented 60% of new global accounts."", ""Getting traction with the younger consumers, who are becoming the critical pillars of the economy, could ensure long-term growth for the business.

At the stock's forward P/E of about 15, American Express could be considered a bargain for the brand name and expected future growth."", ""In the payments-processing industry, Visa (NYSE: V) is another top-tier financial company in the Berkshire Hathaway portfolio. Since the stock accounts for only 0.6% of the portfolio's value, one might say Buffett missed out a bit on Visa's tremendous returns. Since Berkshire first began buying shares in 2011, the stock has returned more than 1,500%, easily outpacing the broader market."", ""Unlike American Express, Visa doesn't lend money. Instead, it charges merchants fees on each transaction that crosses its payment network.

Investors may find that Visa still offers some great years of returns."", ""Buffett's investments in financial stocks extend into emerging markets, too. Nu Holdings (NYSE: NU), a digital bank that serves Latin America, has fantastic long-term growth opportunities. Berkshire bought the stock shortly after its initial public offering (IPO) in late 2021. It's a low-weight position for the conglomerate, accounting for just 0.2% of the portfolio's value."", ""Nu Holdings has nearly 90 million customers in Latin America, a region with more than 660 million people. Of those, an estimated 122 million adults don't have bank accounts. Many of those potential customers are up for grabs as the region's economy develops."", ""Importantly, Nu Holdings is profitable. Based on company forecasts for the completed -- but not yet reported -- Q4, analysts expect to learn that it earned $0.22 per share in 2023. That would give the stock a price-to-earnings ratio (P/E) of 38. Earnings should expand as the company continues growing. Average estimates for 2025 are for EPS of $0.50, giving it a forward P/E of just over 16. Investors willing to hold onto the stock for a few years (or ideally, longer) should see Nu Holdings grow into its valuation and then some.

Since taking over the once-struggling textile company in 1965, Buffett and his team have generated total returns on capital 153 times greater than those of the benchmark S&P 500. He was schooled in the art of value investing from Benjamin Graham, the author of the iconic investing tome The Intelligent Investor, and subsequently adapted it to fit his style.', ""Buffett's slight modifications to Graham's quantitative, value-based investing model include a heavier emphasis on management quality, a company's competitive advantages, and more often than not, a company's dividend growth potential. Not all of Berkshire Hathaway's stock holdings pay dividends, but most of the conglomerate's largest and longest holdings are blue chip dividend payers with a long track record of regular increases to the payout."", 'Which Warren Buffett dividend stocks stand out as top buys in 2024? Due to their formidable economic moats and impressive history of dividend raises, Visa (NYSE: V) and American Express (NYSE: AXP) both screen as outstanding buys right now. Read on to find out more about these two blue chip dividend stocks.', ""Visa is a global titan in the electronic payment services industry. It is also a top 20 Berkshire stock holding, with the conglomerate's position worth about $2.16 billion at the moment."", 'Visa fits the mold of Buffett\'s investing style to a T. Speaking to this point, it has a strong competitive advantage in the electronic payment services market. The company\'s competitive moat has even been labeled as ""unassailable"" by the investment firm Morningstar. Moreover, Visa has increased its dividend payments at a remarkable compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 19.1% over the last 17 years.', ""Visa's dividend program also screens as extremely safe. It has a fairly low payout ratio of 21.7%, and the company is forecast to grow its top line by more than 31% over the next two years. Visa should thus have no problem boosting its cash distributions to shareholders in the years to come."", ""The only minor downside is that the stock's yield is only 0.8%, which is about half that of the average S&P 500-listed stock. However, Visa's stock is highly likely to continue its recent winning streak due to the ongoing shift from cash to digital payments worldwide, which should more than compensate for its low yield."", ""Berkshire has been a loyal shareholder of American Express, or Amex, since the early 1990s. Currently, the credit card and payment services company is the conglomerate's third-largest holding, after Apple and Bank of America."", 'Why has Berkshire held on to this credit card stock for so long? One likely reason is its competitive edge, which comes from its distinctive business model. Unlike other credit card issuers that rely mostly on interest income, Amex makes about 80% of its revenue from fees charged to cardholders and merchants.', 'Another reason is its loyal customer base, which consists of affluent individuals and businesses that use their cards frequently for high-dollar purchases such as travel and entertainment, generating more transaction fees for Amex.', ""As for dividends, Amex has been increasing the size of its dividend checks at a CAGR of 8.4% over the past 20 years. Although the company's yield of 1.28% is below average, it sports a low payout ratio of 26.6% and a solid revenue growth outlook for 2024 (around 9.5%). Hence, its dividend growth potential is superb, to put it mildly."", 'Keeping with this theme, Buffett noted in Berkshire\'s latest annual letter that Amex is ""highly likely"" to continue to increase its cash distributions to shareholders in the years to come.', 'Should you invest $1,000 in Visa right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Visa, consider this:', ""The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Visa wasn't one of them.

Indeed, management recently reiterated a view it first provided last January for 15% to 17% year-over-year revenue growth in 2023. Even more, Amex continues to stick to its aggressive long-term target for annualized average revenue growth of 10% or greater and earnings-per-share growth in the mid-teens in 2024 and beyond.', ""This strong business momentum, combined with the stock's cheap valuation, makes American Express one of my top investment ideas for 2024 and beyond."", ""What's behind the company's extraordinary momentum? Let's examine its operations to find out."", ""The beauty of Amex's business model boils down to its ability to grow revenue and earnings in many different economic environments, thanks to a variety of levers."", 'For instance, consider how the payments company grew total revenue by 16% year over year for the nine-month period that ended Sept. 30, even though network volume grew only 9% year over year. Indeed, even when network volume slowed to 7% growth year over year in Q3, total revenue still rose 13%.', ""How does the company pull this off? The key to Amex's third-quarter growth was increased revenue from its membership fees (net card fee revenue rose 20% year over year), as new and existing customers increasingly choose cards with substantial annual fees in exchange for membership perks."", ""Adding to the versatility of Amex's business, net interest income is likely to accelerate during periods when the company's cardmembers spend less due to macroeconomic uncertainty. This is because revolving loan balances typically increase during times of economic weakness."", ""To this end, Amex's net interest income rose 34% year over year in Q3 to $3.4 billion, accounting for 22% of total revenue. So this aspect of Amex's business arguably offers a lever for the company during more challenging economic environments."", 'Looking to earnings specifically, American Express benefits from faster volume growth during boom times. But there are levers to pull during tough times, as well.', ""During difficult economic environments, for example, Amex's earnings are bolstered by lower credit card reward utilization rates since customers spend less on traveling and ultimately redeem fewer travel perks. Similarly, the company's earnings may benefit from faster top-line growth during good times, when it's easier to acquire more high-quality card members. But Amex can offset some of the negative earnings impact of slower top-line growth during tough times by cutting back on card member acquisition marketing spend as it focuses spending on a smaller subset of higher quality credit profiles."", ""The point is, it's not too surprising American Express continues to grow nicely. Additionally, it's a testament to its model's resilience. Sure, its revenue and earnings would likely take a hit and potentially even turn negative during severe recessionary periods. But there's sound reasoning behind management's aggressive long-term targets, thanks to its resilient, nimble, and lucrative operation."", ""Fortunately, the stock's conservative valuation at about 15 times forward earnings seems to be already pricing in a recession. And as American Express CEO Stephen Squeri often reminds investors, every recession is followed by a recovery. With this in mind, the stock's low forward price-to-earnings ratio has arguably already factored in expected troubles."", 'Notably, Amex management provided a timely update for investors earlier this month during the Goldman Sachs 2023 U.S. Financial Services Conference. Management\'s message was clear: Everything seems to remain on track for a strong finish to the year. Squeri reiterated that the company still expects to grow its top line by a total of 15% to 17% this year. And that view comes despite what was ""a little bit skittish"" October as far as billings growth goes.', 'Squeri\'s optimistic view for the company\'s full-year 2023 performance has been aided by a bounce back in November and ""very strong"" shopping trends from consumers between Thanksgiving and Cyber Monday, the CEO explained during the conference. Even more, Squeri said the company still expects to be able to average annualized revenue growth of around 10% or more in 2024 and beyond and, more importantly, earnings-per-share growth in the mid-teens.', ""Whatever the economy brings, the company's resilience in 2023 and management's confidence going into 2024 show that American Express is likely positioned to do very well over the long term -- especially in the context of the stock's very conservative valuation."", '10 stocks we like better than American ExpressWhen our analyst team has a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

Based on this payment, the dividend yield on the company's stock will be 2.3%, which is an attractive boost to shareholder returns."", ' Check out our latest analysis for NetApp ', 'While it is great to have a strong dividend yield, we should also consider whether the payment is sustainable. Based on the last payment, NetApp was quite comfortably earning enough to cover the dividend. This means that a large portion of its earnings are being retained to grow the business.', 'Looking forward, earnings per share is forecast to rise by 65.5% over the next year. If the dividend continues along recent trends, we estimate the payout ratio will be 42%, which is in the range that makes us comfortable with the sustainability of the dividend.', 'The company has a sustained record of paying dividends with very little fluctuation. The annual payment during the last 10 years was $0.60 in 2014, and the most recent fiscal year payment was $2.00. This means that it has been growing its distributions at 13% per annum over that time. We can see that payments have shown some very nice upward momentum without faltering, which provides some reassurance that future payments will also be reliable.', ""Some investors will be chomping at the bit to buy some of the company's stock based on its dividend history. NetApp has seen EPS rising for the last five years, at 21% per annum.

Coke, on the other hand, has had to rely mostly on price increases to keep sales rising in the past year.', ""Walmart is boosting profitability and generating much stronger cash flow lately, which means management has more capital available to invest in the business and send back to shareholders through stock buybacks and a rising dividend.

We'll use ROE to examine Waste Management, Inc. (NYSE:WM), by way of a worked example."", ""Return on equity or ROE is a key measure used to assess how efficiently a company's management is utilizing the company's capital. In other words, it is a profitability ratio which measures the rate of return on the capital provided by the company's shareholders."", ' Check out our latest analysis for Waste Management ', 'Return on equity can be calculated by using the formula:', ""Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' Equity"", 'So, based on the above formula, the ROE for Waste Management is:', '33% = US$2.3b ÷ US$7.0b (Based on the trailing twelve months to September 2023).', ""The 'return' is the yearly profit. Another way to think of that is that for every $1 worth of equity, the company was able to earn $0.33 in profit."", ""By comparing a company's ROE with its industry average, we can get a quick measure of how good it is. The limitation of this approach is that some companies are quite different from others, even within the same industry classification. Pleasingly, Waste Management has a superior ROE than the average (8.6%) in the Commercial Services industry."", ""That's clearly a positive. With that said, a high ROE doesn't always indicate high profitability. Especially when a firm uses high levels of debt to finance its debt which may boost its ROE but the high leverage puts the company at risk. To know the 2 risks we have identified for Waste Management visit our risks dashboard for free."", ""Companies usually need to invest money to grow their profits. That cash can come from issuing shares, retained earnings, or debt. In the case of the first and second options, the ROE will reflect this use of cash, for growth. In the latter case, the debt required for growth will boost returns, but will not impact the shareholders' equity. In this manner the use of debt will boost ROE, even though the core economics of the business stay the same."", ""It's worth noting the high use of debt by Waste Management, leading to its debt to equity ratio of 2.12. There's no doubt the ROE is impressive, but it's worth keeping in mind that the metric could have been lower if the company were to reduce its debt. Investors should think carefully about how a company might perform if it was unable to borrow so easily, because credit markets do change over time."", ""Return on equity is a useful indicator of the ability of a business to generate profits and return them to shareholders. A company that can achieve a high return on equity without debt could be considered a high quality business. If two companies have around the same level of debt to equity, and one has a higher ROE, I'd generally prefer the one with higher ROE."", 'But ROE is just one piece of a bigger puzzle, since high quality businesses often trade on high multiples of earnings. It is important to consider other factors, such as future profit growth -- and how much investment is required going forward. So I think it may be worth checking this free report on analyst forecasts for the company.', 'Of course Waste Management may not be the best stock to buy.

This year should be its 50th year of dividend growth, which would put it into the noble class of Dividend Kings.', ""What's even more impressive about ADP is that it hasn't been making a habit of giving investors paltry annual raises to keep its streak alive. For example, it raised its payment by 12% last year. Add in its above-average dividend yield (2.4% compared to an average of 1.5% for the S&P 500), and ADP is a great stock for those seeking an attractive and steadily rising income stream."", ""ADP is a global leader in providing HCM software and solutions. It has over 1 million clients across 140 countries, and provides payroll services for more than 41 million workers. The company's business generates lots of recurring revenue and cash flow, partly thanks to its strong client retention rate (92.2% in its fiscal 2023, which ended June 30). It generated $18 billion in revenue during its last fiscal year (up 9%) and $4.2 billion in cash flow (up nearly 36%). It paid less than half that cash flow in dividends ($1.9 billion), leaving ample excess cash to fund growth-related investments and return additional money to investors through share repurchases. "", ""The company also has an elite balance sheet. It ended its fiscal 2023 with over $2 billion in cash against around $3 billion in debt. That backs its exceptional credit rating (AA-/Aa3). ADP's financial fortress puts its dividend on an extremely firm foundation. "", ""ADP is already the category leader in most of the markets in which it participates. However, that doesn't mean it doesn't have a long growth runway. The company estimates that the total addressable market opportunity for its HCM solutions is $150 billion. Further, it expects the market to grow by 5% to 6% annually. With its revenue reaching $18 billion last year, it still has plenty of room to grow. "", 'The company currently expects its revenue to rise by 6% to 7% in fiscal 2024 as it captures more of its large and steadily growing addressable market. That should drive 10% to 12% earnings-per-share growth. Those numbers align with the medium-term growth targets it outlined at its last investor day in 2021, which were 7% to 8% annual revenue growth and 11% to 13% adjusted earnings-per-share growth. ', 'That forecast suggests ADP should be able to continue growing its dividend at an above-average rate. The company is targeting a dividend payout ratio of 55% to 60% of its adjusted earnings. (It was right around 60% in its fiscal 2023.) ADP should have a similar payout ratio in fiscal 2024, given its recent 12% dividend increase and expectations that earnings will rise by 10% to 12% in the current fiscal year. ', ""Meanwhile, with a medium-term earnings growth rate of 11% to 13% and a payout ratio in the neighborhood of its current level, ADP could continue raising its dividend at double-digit percentage rates in the coming years. That's a strong growth rate, considering the current expectation that companies in the S&P 500 will, on average, grow their dividends by around 6% annually over the next few years. "", 'That sets ADP up to potentially produce attractive total returns. With a more than 2% dividend yield and double-digit earnings and dividend growth, the HCM solutions provider could deliver an average annual total return percentage in the low-to-mid teens. ', ""ADP appears to be a lock to reach Dividend King status in 2024. And its streak of payout hikes should continue beyond this year, given the company's fortress-like financial profile and strong growth prospects.

It’s easily the powerhouse in the energy sector, thus warranting a closer look.', 'Pros: Notably, ConocoPhillips also prints a three-year revenue growth rate of 28.4%, blowing past nearly 81% of its rivals. It also features a price/earnings-to-growth (PEG) ratio of 0.53X, lower than the sector median 0.92X.', 'Cons: Recent sales performances have dipped conspicuously so investors need to be cautious of outside pressures impacting hydrocarbon players.', 'Source: askarim / Shutterstock', 'What it is: A company that needs no introduction because you probably use its products on a daily basis, Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) stands alone as a consumer technology giant. And while it’s not nearly as efficient as energy players based on profit per employee, it is the most efficient among non-energy, non-government-associated enterprises.', 'Relevance: Per Agency Reviews, Apple lands at number 13 in terms of employee-focused high-efficiency stocks. Apple posted net income of $99.8 billion in FY 2022 (ended September). At the time, it boasted a workforce of 164,000 people. Therefore, its profit per employee came out to $609,000. It also helps that consumers can’t get enough of Apple-branded smart devices.', 'Pros: Despite being a mature idea among high-efficiency stocks, it continues to print an impressive three-year revenue growth rate of 15.7%. As well, Apple enjoys robust margins across the board. Unsurprisingly, it’s consistently profitable.', 'Cons: If there’s something to nitpick, AAPL runs rich multiples. For example, it trades at a lofty 29.33X forward earnings.', 'Source: Casimiro PT / Shutterstock.com', 'What it is: A home construction company, D.R. Horton (NYSE:DHI) and the rest of the industry has been in the crosshairs of economists and various market pundits. With low interest rates driving intense demand for real estate, sales blossomed for D.R. Horton. However, the combo of high inflation and high borrowing costs imposes an ambiguous cloud over the business.', 'Relevance: While many questions exist about DHI, it’s notable for its standing as one of the high-efficiency stocks. Per the market research specialist, the company lands at number 16. In FY 2022 (ended September), the homebuilder posted net income of nearly $5.9 billion. At the time, it had 13,237 people on its payroll. That yields a profit per employee of $443,000.', 'Pros: So long as the housing shortage fuels buyer demand, DHI seemingly stands on solid ground. It’s been on a blistering run since late October.', 'Cons: Despite the encouraging rally, DHI may impose bag-holding concerns if economic headwinds sideline would-be buyers.', 'Source: Jer123 / Shutterstock.com', 'What it is: Founded in 1919, American International Group (NYSE:AIG) is a multinational finance and insurance corporation. Per its public profile, it features operations in more than 80 countries and jurisdictions. While not the most exciting enterprise, AIG commands a pertinent business that may be able to negotiate turbulent waters.', 'Relevance: Perhaps an oddball name that many investors wouldn’t think of as belonging to a list of high-efficiency stocks, AIG secured the number-17 slot. At the end of fiscal 2022, the company posted net income of $10.3 billion. During that snapshot, the company carried a workforce of 26,200 people. That yielded a profit per employee of $392,000. Significantly, it stands out among financial businesses.', 'Pros: Currently, AIG runs a three-year EBITDA growth rate of 25%, beating out nearly 81% of rivals. Also, it enjoys an above average net margin of 8.14%.', 'Cons: It could use some work in the balance sheet, particularly its high debt level compared to cash.', 'Source: photobyphm / Shutterstock.com', 'What it is: A multinational pharmaceutical and biotechnology firm, Pfizer (NYSE:PFE) already ranked among the top players in the industry. However, it truly soared to prominence thanks to its efforts in forwarding a Covid-19 vaccine. Unfortunately for stakeholders, faded fears of the SARS-CoV-2 virus led to a severe erosion of equity value.', 'Relevance: One possible avenue for success is that Pfizer could leverage its technologies to advance new therapeutics and vaccines. While that’s a speculative proposition, what’s a sure thing is that the company posted net income of $31.4 billion in 2022. With a workforce of 83,000, Pfizer’s profit per employee came out to $378,000. Therefore, it’s easily one of the high-efficiency stocks within the broader healthcare umbrella.', 'Pros: PFE is also significantly undervalued on paper. For instance, shares trade at only 8.78X forward earnings, far lower than the sector median 14.53X.', 'Cons: Pfizer’s relevance needs to come to the forefront soon because of severe market erosion.', 'Source: izzuanroslan / Shutterstock.com', 'What it is: A company that revolutionized the entertainment media landscape, Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) initially started off as a platform enabling convenient consumption of content. Later, it helped popularize the concept of on-demand video via streaming. Now, the company is also known for its groundbreaking original content.', 'Relevance: Along with dominating the entertainment industry and shifting paradigms within the ecosystem, Netflix also has the distinction of being one of the high-efficiency stocks. In 2022, the company posted net income of $4.5 billion. At the time, it had 12,800 employees on its payroll, yielding a $351,000 profit per employee. That’s only going to make its media rivals even more jealous.', 'Pros: While Netflix has endured challenges due to competitive pressures, it’s still a top-tier performer. For example, its three-year revenue growth rate clocks in at 16.2%, beating out 84% of its peers. And it’s consistently profitable.', 'Cons: Given the dominance of the company, NFLX doesn’t come cheap, priced at nearly 31X forward earnings.', 'Source: Ascannio / Shutterstock.com', 'What it is: Leveraging the largest social media network in the world, Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) is – if we assume no catastrophic implosion – permanently relevant thanks to Facebook. With over 3 billion monthly active users (MAUs), the network represents a big data goldmine. As well, Meta has transitioned into a tech juggernaut.', 'Relevance: While it’s not the most heralded tech enterprise when it comes to high-efficiency stocks, Meta more than holds its own. In 2022, the company posted net income of $23.2 billion. At the time, it featured a headcount of 86,482 on its payroll. These metrics yielded a profit per employee of $268,000, landing it on the number 24 spot.', 'Pros: Meta continues to impress onlookers, particularly with a three-year revenue growth rate of 20.6%. That stat ranks better than 70.13% of companies in the interactive media space. Also, it features robust operating and net margins.', 'Cons: META isn’t overly expensive but it’s not cheap, priced at 31.3X trailing-year earnings.', 'On the date of publication, Josh Enomoto did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.\xa0The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com\xa0Publishing Guidelines.', 'Musk’s “Project Omega” May Be Set to Mint New Millionaires.

I think MSC Industrial (NYSE: MSM), Freeport-McMoRan (NYSE: FCX), and On Semiconductor (NASDAQ: ON) are three names worth looking at closely. They are all companies with excellent megatrends behind them and look set for long-term growth.', ""Significant events often change how companies think about running their businesses. In this case, the COVID-19 pandemic and the accompanying lockdowns created massive pressure on supply chains. These issues, most visibly seen in semiconductor shortages that affected myriad companies' ability to deliver products and sent costs soaring, have caused many companies to reassess their supply chains and procurement strategies."", ""As such, companies are looking to reduce supply chain complexity, often reducing their number of suppliers and looking to reshore production to the United States. It's no accident that U.S. manufacturing spending has boomed in recent years."", 'According to the Department of the Treasury, this spending is primarily ""driven by construction for computer, electronic, and electrical manufacturing"" and supported by broader spending.', ""This is music to the ears of industrial suppliers like MSC Industrial, whose sales are its customers' metalworking and maintenance, repair, and operations (MRO) needs. While the company is currently going through a period of softness in its end markets and is susceptible to some bad news flow, it's nothing that lower interest rates won't alleviate later in the year."", 'Moreover, if the renaissance in U.S. manufacturing and reshoring continues, then MSC Industrial will be one of the long-term winners.', ""The world is moving away from the internal combustion engine (ICE) and toward electric vehicles (EVs). It's also moving away from reliance on fossil fuels for energy generation toward renewable energy. Both trends are positive for copper demand, as EVs require much more copper, mainly in its wiring, than ICE vehicles do."", 'Meanwhile, investment in wind, solar energy, and storage solutions imply significant investment in copper, including investments in the transmission and distribution networks necessary to connect renewable energy to the grid. In addition, the ongoing electrification-of-everything trend -- think data centers, industrial automation, and smart buildings, infrastructure, and cities -- is also driving demand.', 'That all speaks to a solid underlying demand for copper, and Freeport-McMoRan, with its substantive copper mining operations in Indonesia and the U.S., stands well placed to benefit. The demand side of the equation is positive for Freeport-McMoRan, and the supply side is, too.', 'At the same time copper is needed for the energy transition, increasing environmental legislation makes obtaining mining permits harder. Not only does that restrict supply growth, helping support prices, but it also puts a premium on miners such as Freeport-McMoRan, who have brownfield expansion opportunities in Indonesia, Chile, and Arizona, as well as an initiative to extract copper from existing stockpiles using advanced recovery techniques. It all makes Freeport-McMoRan an ideal way to play the energy transition.', ""In common with MSC Industrial, On Semiconductor is experiencing some cyclical weakness in its end markets, but that doesn't mean its long-term growth strategy isn't right. Semiconductor companies are known for their exposure to cyclical end markets such as consumer electronics and information technology. When these types of customers see a slowdown in their sales, the first thing they do is cut semiconductor orders."", 'As such, semiconductor companies are usually treated as cyclical companies with volatile earnings and extra near-term risk. On Semiconductor is trying to reduce that cyclicality by exiting non-core markets and focusing on the secular megatrends in its two core end markets, namely industrials and automotive.', 'Management believes that growth technologies such as industrial automation, EV charging, renewable-energy infrastructure, advanced driver-assistance systems, and 5G networks provide On Semiconductor with an opportunity to increase their content significantly.', ""The near-term problem is that one undisclosed customer is holding back investment in response to weakening automotive sales. While that's disappointing to hear, it doesn't change the long-term investment thesis or the need for the automotive industry to invest in EVs hungry for the kind of intelligent power and sensing solutions On Semiconductor provides."", ""Moreover, the company's forward price-to-earnings ratio of 17.4, based on analyst estimates, arguably already reflects the bad news from a customer. Lower interest rates in 2024 will help, and On Semiconductor's secular growth markets look very well placed, making the stock attractive for growth investors."", 'Should you invest $1,000 in Freeport-McMoRan right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Freeport-McMoRan, consider this:', ""The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Freeport-McMoRan wasn't one of them.

Despite its impressive finances, the beverage giant's stock performance trailed the Dow Jones Industrial Average by a wide margin in 2023."", ""Wall Street is concerned about Coke's relatively weak sales outlook as consumer demand tilts away from traditional sodas. Shares also seem expensive, compared to industry peers."", ""The good news is that you've got some attractive options among dividend stocks if you're looking for alternatives to Coke stock today. Walmart (NYSE: WMT) has a similarly dominant market share, for example, and PepsiCo (NASDAQ: PEP) shares are valued at a discount compared to the beverage titan. Let's look at some excellent reasons to buy these two dividend giants instead of Coca-Cola right now."", ""Walmart stock fared better than Coke in 2023, but the retailer still trailed the wider market for the year. Its 11.2% increase for the year wasn't enough to keep up with the Dow's 13.7% rise or the 24.2% spike that investors saw in the S&P 500. Coke stock fell 7.4% in 2023."", 'Yet better returns are likely on the way. In mid-November, Walmart reported solid customer traffic trends heading into the core holiday shopping season. Comparable-store sales in the U.S. market rose 5%, thanks to the combination of a 3% traffic increase and 2% higher average spending. Coke, on the other hand, has had to rely mostly on price increases to keep sales rising in the past year.', ""Walmart is boosting profitability and generating much stronger cash flow lately, which means management has more capital available to invest in the business and send back to shareholders through stock buybacks and a rising dividend. Sure, Walmart's yield is about half of Coke's 3.1%, but with profits rising faster than sales this year, investors can expect more significant dividend hikes ahead. Meanwhile, consider taking advantage of this cheaply valued stock that's priced at 0.7x annual sales, compared to Costco Wholesale's price-to-sales ratio (P/S) of 1.2."", ""If you'd prefer to stay in the same industry, consider PepsiCo as another great alternative. This dividend stock is arguably less risky than Coke, due to its more diverse sales portfolio that includes snack and breakfast foods in addition to beverages. Investors saw concrete benefits of this diversification during the early phases of the pandemic when Coke's sales plummeted while Pepsi's remained more stable."", 'Pepsi has its share of challenges, to be sure. The company is posting negative sales volumes in several of its niches, which means investors will want to watch that metric for a rebound going forward.', ""Yet profitability is strong and rising, cash flow is ample, and Pepsi has a clear path toward continued market-share gains as it innovates across brands like Doritos, Quaker, and Gatorade. Pepsi's dividend yield sits close to Coke's 3% rate, offering a nice bonus for patient investors willing to hold this stock over the long term."", ""Both companies have decades of experience behind them at steadily boosting their payouts each year. And there's no reason why both stocks couldn't be a good fit in a diversified portfolio."", ""But Pepsi, along with Walmart, offers some attractive features that aren't available in a Coca-Cola investment at the moment. Consider keeping them on your watch list, then, if you're looking for other strong dividend options."", 'Should you invest $1,000 in Walmart right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Walmart, consider this:', ""The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Walmart wasn't one of them.

Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value.

But with many investors expecting interest rates to stabilize or decline in 2024, it makes sense to consider adding a few of these unloved blue chip dividend plays back to your portfolio.', ""That's because over the long run, many stable blue chip tech stocks with high yields tend to outperform fixed-income investments with set maturity dates. So as the new year starts, I think it would be smart to buy three dividend plays: Cisco (NASDAQ: CSCO), Texas Instruments (NASDAQ: TXN), and Corning (NYSE: GLW)."", ""Cisco is the world's largest networking hardware and software company. The company struggled with supply chain constraints in fiscal 2022 (which ended in July 2022), but it overcame those challenges in fiscal 2023, and revenue growth accelerated again."", ""Unfortunately, that recovery ended in the first quarter of fiscal 2024 as Cisco's revenue declined sequentially again. Macro headwinds caused the slowdown, driving many of its large enterprise, service provider, and cloud customers to deploy their purchased hardware at a slower-than-expected rate."", 'Cisco CEO Chuck Robbins admitted that customers were still waiting to deploy ""one quarter to two quarters\' worth of shipped orders"" -- and that the company\'s revenue would drop 4% to 6% for the full year as its adjusted EPS stays roughly flat. That outlook weighed down the stock, but it now trades at just 13 times forward earnings and pays a high forward dividend yield of 3.1%. That low valuation and high yield should limit its downside potential until the company overcomes near-term challenges.', ""Cisco is also in the process of acquiring Splunk to expand its networking observability and cybersecurity platforms. That $28 billion deal, which is expected to close in the third quarter of calendar 2024, should reduce Cisco's dependence on traditional networking hardware and increase the stickiness of its software and services ecosystem."", ""Texas Instruments manufactures analog and embedded chips for a broad range of customers. These chips aren't as powerful as CPUs or GPUs, but they handle essential tasks such as wireless communications and power management features."", ""Over the past year, the softness of TI's industrial and communications markets -- which were both heavily exposed to the macro headwinds -- offset the stronger growth in its automotive, personal electronics, and enterprise systems markets. That's why analysts expect its revenue and earnings to decline 12% and 25%, respectively, in 2023."", ""That cyclical slowdown, along with the company's commitment to ramp up its spending on its long-term transition from 200mm to 300mm wafers, which will reduce the costs of its unpackaged parts by roughly 40% over the long term, spooked the bulls. For 2024, analysts expect its revenue to rise just 1% as its earnings decline another 6%."", ""That near-term outlook seems grim, but TI has weathered downturns before. It's also committed to returning most of its free cash flow (FCF) to its investors through buybacks and dividends. The company bought back nearly half its shares since 2004 and raised its dividend annually for the past 20 years. Its attractive forward yield of 3.1%, along with a reasonable forward multiple of 25, should limit the downside potential as the macro environment improves and TI upgrades its plants."", 'Corning is the creator of Gorilla Glass, the chemically hardened glass that shields LCD and OLED screens on smartphones and other devices.

But in 2022, Corning's revenue rose only 1% -- and analysts anticipate a 9% decline in 2023. That deceleration was largely driven by the softness of its optical and display panel markets, Apple's slower iPhone sales, and tough currency headwinds. Analysts expect earnings to decline 19%."", 'But just like Cisco and TI, Corning has survived cyclical downturns before. Corning reduced its share count by nearly 40% over the past decade, and it still looks cheap at 15 times forward earnings.
