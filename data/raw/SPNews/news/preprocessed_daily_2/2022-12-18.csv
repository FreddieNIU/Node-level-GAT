Despite this raise, the dividend yield of 1.5% is only a modest boost to shareholder returns. See our latest analysis for Nucor Nucor's Earnings Easily Cover The DistributionsEven a low dividend yield can be attractive if it is sustained for years on end. Before making this announcement, Nucor was easily earning enough to cover the dividend. This means that most of what the business earns is being used to help it grow.Looking forward, earnings per share is forecast to fall by 67.3% over the next year. If the dividend continues along recent trends, we estimate the payout ratio could be 19%, which we consider to be quite comfortable, with most of the company's earnings left over to grow the business in the future.historic-dividendNucor Has A Solid Track RecordEven over a long history of paying dividends, the company's distributions have been remarkably stable. Since 2012, the dividend has gone from $1.46 total annually to $2.00. This means that it has been growing its distributions at 3.2% per annum over that time. Slow and steady dividend growth might not sound that exciting, but dividends have been stable for ten years, which we think makes this a fairly attractive offer.The Dividend Looks Likely To GrowSome investors will be chomping at the bit to buy some of the company's stock based on its dividend history. It's encouraging to see that Nucor has been growing its earnings per share at 58% a year over the past five years. Earnings have been growing rapidly, and with a low payout ratio we think that the company could turn out to be a great dividend stock.We Really Like Nucor's DividendOverall, we think this could be an attractive income stock, and it is only getting better by paying a higher dividend this year. The company is generating plenty of cash, and the earnings also quite easily cover the distributions. However, it is worth noting that the earnings are expected to fall over the next year, which may not change the long term outlook, but could affect the dividend payment in the next 12 months. Taking this all into consideration, this looks like it could be a good dividend opportunity.Story continuesCompanies possessing a stable dividend policy will likely enjoy greater investor interest than those suffering from a more inconsistent approach. However, there are other things to consider for investors when analysing stock performance. Just as an example, we've come across 2 warning signs for Nucor you should be aware of, and 1 of them can't be ignored.

But as Peter Lynch said in One Up On Wall Street, 'Long shots almost never pay off.' Loss-making companies are always racing against time to reach financial sustainability, so investors in these companies may be taking on more risk than they should.If this kind of company isn't your style, you like companies that generate revenue, and even earn profits, then you may well be interested in Acuity Brands (NYSE:AYI). Now this is not to say that the company presents the best investment opportunity around, but profitability is a key component to success in business. Check out our latest analysis for Acuity Brands Acuity Brands' Earnings Per Share Are GrowingIf a company can keep growing earnings per share (EPS) long enough, its share price should eventually follow. Therefore, there are plenty of investors who like to buy shares in companies that are growing EPS. We can see that in the last three years Acuity Brands grew its EPS by 13% per year. That growth rate is fairly good, assuming the company can keep it up.One way to double-check a company's growth is to look at how its revenue, and earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) margins are changing. EBIT margins for Acuity Brands remained fairly unchanged over the last year, however the company should be pleased to report its revenue growth for the period of 16% to US$4.0b. That's encouraging news for the company!In the chart below, you can see how the company has grown earnings and revenue, over time. To see the actual numbers, click on the chart.earnings-and-revenue-historyYou don't drive with your eyes on the rear-view mirror, so you might be more interested in this free report showing analyst forecasts for Acuity Brands' future profits.Are Acuity Brands Insiders Aligned With All Shareholders?It's said that there's no smoke without fire. For investors, insider buying is often the smoke that indicates which stocks could set the market alight. This view is based on the possibility that stock purchases signal bullishness on behalf of the buyer. However, small purchases are not always indicative of conviction, and insiders don't always get it right.Story continuesAcuity Brands top brass are certainly in sync, not having sold any shares, over the last year. But the bigger deal is that the Independent Director, Laura O'Shaughnessy, paid US$100k to buy shares at an average price of US$175. Purchases like this clue us in to the to the faith management has in the business' future.Along with the insider buying, another encouraging sign for Acuity Brands is that insiders, as a group, have a considerable shareholding. As a matter of fact, their holding is valued at US$29m. This considerable investment should help drive long-term value in the business. While their ownership only accounts for 0.6%, this is still a considerable amount at stake to encourage the business to maintain a strategy that will deliver value to shareholders.Is Acuity Brands Worth Keeping An Eye On?One important encouraging feature of Acuity Brands is that it is growing profits. In addition, insiders have been busy adding to their sizeable holdings in the company. That makes the company a prime candidate for your watchlist - and arguably a research priority. Of course, just because Acuity Brands is growing does not mean it is undervalued. If you're wondering about the valuation, check out this gauge of its price-to-earnings ratio, as compared to its industry.There are plenty of other companies that have insiders buying up shares.

2,99219f53-d827-3368-90e9-bd235b3661b6,USB,2022-12-18,"With 67% ownership of the shares, U.S. Bancorp (NYSE:USB) is heavily dominated by institutional owners",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/67-ownership-shares-u-bancorp-130046334.html,1671368446,STORY,"['USB', 'USB-PQ']","[Every investor in U.S. Bancorp (NYSE:USB) should be aware of the most powerful shareholder groups. The group holding the most number of shares in the company, around 67% to be precise, is institutions. In other words, the group stands to gain the most (or lose the most) from their investment into the company.Since institutional have access to huge amounts of capital, their market moves tend to receive a lot of scrutiny by retail or individual investors. As a result, a sizeable amount of institutional money invested in a firm is generally viewed as a positive attribute.In the chart below, we zoom in on the different ownership groups of U.S. Bancorp. Check out our latest analysis for U.S. Bancorp ownership-breakdownWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About U.S. Bancorp?Many institutions measure their performance against an index that approximates the local market. So they usually pay more attention to companies that are included in major indices.We can see that U.S. Bancorp does have institutional investors; and they hold a good portion of the company's stock. This suggests some credibility amongst professional investors. But we can't rely on that fact alone since institutions make bad investments sometimes, just like everyone does. When multiple institutions own a stock, there's always a risk that they are in a 'crowded trade'. When such a trade goes wrong, multiple parties may compete to sell stock fast. This risk is higher in a company without a history of growth. You can see U.S. Bancorp's historic earnings and revenue below, but keep in mind there's always more to the story.earnings-and-revenue-growthInvestors should note that institutions actually own more than half the company, so they can collectively wield significant power. We note that hedge funds don't have a meaningful investment in U.S. Bancorp. The Vanguard Group, Inc. is currently the largest shareholder, with 7.5% of shares outstanding. BlackRock, Inc. is the second largest shareholder owning 6.3% of common stock, and State Street Global Advisors, Inc. holds about 3.8% of the company stock.Story continuesOn studying our ownership data, we found that 25 of the top shareholders collectively own less than 50% of the share register, implying that no single individual has a majority interest.While it makes sense to study institutional ownership data for a company, it also makes sense to study analyst sentiments to know which way the wind is blowing. Quite a few analysts cover the stock, so you could look into forecast growth quite easily.Insider Ownership Of U.S. BancorpThe definition of an insider can differ slightly between different countries, but members of the board of directors always count. The company management answer to the board and the latter should represent the interests of shareholders. Notably, sometimes top-level managers are on the board themselves.Most consider insider ownership a positive because it can indicate the board is well aligned with other shareholders. However, on some occasions too much power is concentrated within this group.Our information suggests that U.S. Bancorp insiders own under 1% of the company. Being so large, we would not expect insiders to own a large proportion of the stock. Collectively, they own US$105m of stock. Arguably recent buying and selling is just as important to consider. You can  click here to see if insiders have been buying or selling. General Public OwnershipWith a 29% ownership, the general public, mostly comprising of individual investors, have some degree of sway over U.S. Bancorp. This size of ownership, while considerable, may not be enough to change company policy if the decision is not in sync with other large shareholders.Public Company OwnershipWe can see that public companies hold 3.3% of the U.S. Bancorp shares on issue. We can't be certain but it is quite possible this is a strategic stake. The businesses may be similar, or work together.Next Steps:I find it very interesting to look at who exactly owns a company. But to truly gain insight, we need to consider other information, too. Take risks for example - U.S. Bancorp has   2 warning signs   we think you should be aware of.If you are like me, you may want to think about whether this company will grow or shrink. Luckily, you can check this free report showing analyst forecasts for its future.NB: Figures in this article are calculated using data from the last twelve months, which refer to the 12-month period ending on the last date of the month the financial statement is dated.

3,caeeade9-5417-39bc-afb8-4f10ef030c30,WMT,2022-12-18,Here's What To Make Of Walmart's (NYSE:WMT) Decelerating Rates Of Return,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/heres-walmarts-nyse-wmt-decelerating-130027038.html,1671368427,STORY,['WMT'],"[Did you know there are some financial metrics that can provide clues of a potential multi-bagger? Ideally, a business will show two trends; firstly a growing return on capital employed (ROCE) and secondly, an increasing amount of capital employed. If you see this, it typically means it's a company with a great business model and plenty of profitable reinvestment opportunities. However, after briefly looking over the numbers, we don't think Walmart (NYSE:WMT) has the makings of a multi-bagger going forward, but let's have a look at why that may be.What Is Return On Capital Employed (ROCE)?For those that aren't sure what ROCE is, it measures the amount of pre-tax profits a company can generate from the capital employed in its business. The formula for this calculation on Walmart is:Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)0.16 = US$24b ÷ (US$248b - US$101b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to October 2022).So, Walmart has an ROCE of 16%.  In absolute terms, that's a satisfactory return, but compared to the Consumer Retailing industry average of 9.6% it's much better. Check out our latest analysis for Walmart roceAbove you can see how the current ROCE for Walmart compares to its prior returns on capital, but there's only so much you can tell from the past. If you'd like, you can check out the forecasts from the analysts covering Walmart here  for free.How Are Returns Trending?Over the past five years, Walmart's ROCE and capital employed have both remained mostly flat. This tells us the company isn't reinvesting in itself, so it's plausible that it's past the growth phase. So don't be surprised if Walmart doesn't end up being a multi-bagger in a few years time. This probably explains why Walmart is paying out 35% of its income to shareholders in the form of dividends. Unless businesses have highly compelling growth opportunities, they'll typically return some money to shareholders.Story continuesOn a separate but related note, it's important to know that Walmart has a current liabilities to total assets ratio of 41%, which we'd consider pretty high. This can bring about some risks because the company is basically operating with a rather large reliance on its suppliers or other sorts of short-term creditors. Ideally we'd like to see this reduce as that would mean fewer obligations bearing risks.What We Can Learn From Walmart's ROCEIn a nutshell, Walmart has been trudging along with the same returns from the same amount of capital over the last five years. Although the market must be expecting these trends to improve because the stock has gained 59% over the last five years. Ultimately, if the underlying trends persist, we wouldn't hold our breath on it being a multi-bagger going forward.One more thing to note, we've identified   3 warning signs  with Walmart and understanding these should be part of your investment process.For those who like to invest in solid companies, check out this free list of companies with solid balance sheets and high returns on equity.Have feedback on this article?

To skip our detailed analysis, you can go directly to see the 5 Most Diverse Companies in the US.Amid a growing pressure from investors and convincing evidence of economic benefits, companies have started to take ESG (environmental, social and governance) principles very seriously. Over the past few years we have seen a dramatic rise in activist investors pushing major companies to follow ESG practices. Studies also show that ESG is directly linked to economic benefits. For example, a study by Moore Global, which included 1,262 large companies from eight major economies, found that companies that took ESG seriously saw their revenue grow twice the rate of those that are not as committed to ESG. The study also found that profits for companies that stick to ESG principles rose three times faster than those less keen on ESG. The study also said that about 83% of companies invested in ESG reported improved customer retention, while 84% reported that ESG practices improved their ability to attract external investment.Investors are also flocking to companies with strong ESG practices because there’s real money to be made in ESG investing. A 2019 report by McKinsey showed that global sustainable investing topped $30 trillion, a whopping 68% rise from 2014. The climate change problem and increasing awareness about human rights would only increase opportunities in the ESG space.The importance of ESG in investing space can be gauged from the fact that the US government is initiating several actions to enforce companies to stick to ESG rules. The Securities and Exchange Commission is working to develop a common benchmark on how sustainable products are assessed and reported. However, such practices also resulted in a backlash from several companies.Data from Bloomberg Intelligence shows that global ESG assets are expected to surpass a whopping $50 trillion by 2025.Story continuesTo rank the most diverse companies in the U.S., we considered rankings by major publications including Forbes, Fortune, Vervoe and Diversity Inc.

If you want to see more best cheap stocks to buy now for long term, go directly to 5 Best Cheap Stocks to Buy Now for Long Term.To many investors, a cheap stock isn't a stock that's trading for a low stock price.Instead, a cheap stock is a stock of a company that is trading for considerably below its intrinsic value. A company's intrinsic value is what the company is really worth.Although there are exceptions, the intrinsic value of high quality companies with competitive advantages tend to go up in the long term as those companies grow their market share or launch new products or services. The earnings per share of those companies can go higher as those companies buy back their stock. Those high quality companies can also pay a dividend as a way to return capital back to shareholders.In the long term, quality stocks with competitive advantages tend to outperform stocks that might trade for lower valuations but don't have the same quality businesses.In the near term, however, some quality stocks might trade for lower valuations than they should given the market headwinds this year.2022In terms of 2022, there have been a lot of market headwinds for stocks given the Federal Reserve has raised interest rates seven times this year. As a result of the interest rate increases, the Federal Reserve's federal funds rate is now 4.25% to 4.5% and the U.S. central bank might not be done with the raises.According to projections released from the Federal Reserve during a December two day policy meeting, the U.S. central bank will raise interest rates past 5% next year.Given the interest rate increases, borrowing costs have increased and it is harder for some businesses to make money. With the higher rates, some businesses have seen softer demand and the overall valuation of the broader market has decreased as capital has moved from the equities market into Treasuries. With the higher interest rates, many economists think there could be a recession next year.Story continuesWith the lower overall market, the stocks of some high quality businesses are arguably fairly cheap given their future potential in the long term.Given the uncertainty, however, it could be a good idea for long term investors to own a well diversified portfolio of stocks across many different sectors.Pixabay/Public DomainMethodologyFor our list of 10 Best Cheap Stocks to Buy Now for Long Term, we picked 10 stocks with competitive advantages that arguably trade below their intrinsic value in the long term.We then ranked the 10 stocks based on the number of hedge funds in our database that held shares of the same stock at the end of Q3.For those of you interested, check out 12 Cheap Stocks to Buy That Outperformed in 2022.10 Best Cheap Stocks to Buy Now for Long Term10.

(NYSE:CCI) shares are lower, the company's Q3 AFFO nevertheless increased by 5% year over year to $1.85 per share. Furthermore, Crown Castle International Corp. (NYSE:CCI) still benefits from 5G development in the U.S which could increase demand for the company's communications infrastructure in the long term.If demand remains strong, Crown Castle International Corp. (NYSE:CCI) could continue to increase AFFO per share and its intrinsic value could increase in the long term.Alongside Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META), Amazon.com, Inc.

Given the increases, Wal-Mart continued to gain market share in the grocery sector, giving it even more scale to support its everyday low prices.In the third quarter, Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT) approved a new $20 billion share repurchase authorization to replace its existing authorization which had $1.9 billion remaining at the end of September. With the share repurchases, the company could continue to increase its EPS if it maintains its market share.Of the 920 hedge funds in our database, 68 owned shares of Walmart Inc.

We added leading financial institution Bank of America Corporation (NYSE:BAC) which serves individual consumers, small and middle-market businesses, and large corporations with a full range of banking, investing, asset management, and other financial and risk management products and services. The current company was formed through various mergers including NationsBank, FleetBoston, US Trust, Countrywide Financial, and Merrill Lynch with the legacy commercial bank to form a national banking powerhouse and bulge bracket investment firm. As one of the ‘Big Four’ U.S. banks it enjoys scale driven cost advantages and economies of scale which provide meaningful competitive advantages and potential for strong returns in the largely commoditized banking industry. A survivor of the financial crisis, BAC has emerged with a solid capital base and stands to benefit from a rising interest rate environment.6. JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. (NYSE:JPM)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 110Given many analysts think JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co.

If you want to see more stocks in this selection, check out Jim Cramer's 5 Favorite Dividend Aristocrats. Jim Cramer, the host of Mad Money on CNBC and an anchor on Squawk on the Street, is one of the most followed television personalities commenting on Wall Street equities. At the end of August this year, Cramer put out a list of his 10 favorite “dividend aristocrats” to buy and hold throughout 2022, noting that their dividend payouts provide a safe haven against Federal Reserve policies and consequent market declines. Cramer observed that dividend aristocrats, which are members of the S&amp;P 500 Index with a history of increasing dividends consistently for at least 25 years, have fared better than the broader U.S. stock index. On December 16, Cramer attempted to address the primary investor concern regarding the United States slipping into a recession in the coming year. He told his viewers on Mad Money: “We want the Fed to talk a big game, without needing to actually do too much. Talk is better than action. We want [Fed Chair Jerome Powell] to scare the economy into slowing under its own weight. We don’t want endless rate hikes ... that will destroy everything in its path.”Jim Cramer made these comments in light of the Fed raising interest rates by half a percentage point to their highest levels in 15 years on December 14. The S&amp;P 500 was also down 5.6% in December, continuing its losing streak for weeks. In this market environment, some of the dividend aristocrats favored by Jim Cramer for 2022 include The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO), Caterpillar Inc. (NYSE:CAT), and McDonald's Corporation (NYSE:MCD). Our MethodologyWe explored the 10 dividend aristocrats that Jim Cramer listed as his favorites on an August 30 segment of CNBC’s Mad Money. We have also mentioned the comments he made about these stocks after August 30, to see whether he stands by his original bullish thesis for all these names. We have assessed the hedge fund sentiment from Insider Monkey’s database of 920 elite hedge funds tracked as of the end of the third quarter of 2022. The list is arranged according to the number of hedge fund holders in each firm. Story continuesJim Cramer's Favorite Dividend AristocratsJim Cramer's Favorite Dividend Aristocrats10. Federal Realty Investment Trust (NYSE:FRT)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 24Dividend Yield as of December 16: 4.13%Federal Realty Investment Trust (NYSE:FRT) is a leader in the ownership and operation of high quality retail properties located in primary coastal markets ranging from Washington to Boston, as well as San Francisco and Los Angeles. Federal Realty Investment Trust (NYSE:FRT) aims to distribute long-term, sustainable growth through investing in areas where retail demand outpaces supply. CNBC’s Jim Cramer said in an episode of Mad Money on August 30 that the REIT yields about 4.2% and owns huge suburban retail properties. The reason Federal Realty Investment Trust (NYSE:FRT) featured as one of Cramer’s favorite dividend aristocrats was because the kind of properties it owns and leases remain resilient despite economic weakness. On September 14, Jim Cramer reiterated his support for Federal Realty Investment Trust (NYSE:FRT), saying:“While most retail stocks are horrible right now … the companies that own the best retail real estate are doing just fine.” On November 3, Federal Realty Investment Trust (NYSE:FRT) reported a Q3 FFO of $1.59 and a revenue of $273.45 million, outperforming Wall Street estimates by $0.06 and $12.29 million, respectively. The company raised its full-year 2022 earnings per diluted share guidance to $3.88-$3.93 and increased full-year FFO per diluted share guidance to $6.27 - $6.32 from the prior outlook of $6.10-$6.25 and a $6.21 consensus. According to Insider Monkey’s data, 24 hedge funds reported owning stakes worth $132 million in Federal Realty Investment Trust (NYSE:FRT) at the end of Q3 2022, compared to the same number of funds in the prior quarter worth $200 million. Like The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO), Caterpillar Inc. (NYSE:CAT), and McDonald's Corporation (NYSE:MCD), Federal Realty Investment Trust (NYSE:FRT) is one of the dividend aristocrats backed by Jim Cramer. 9. Realty Income Corporation (NYSE:O)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 28Dividend Yield as of December 16: 4.61%Realty Income Corporation (NYSE:O) is an S&amp;P 500 company that seeks to deliver shareholders with dependable monthly income. It is a California-based company that invests in free-standing, single-tenant commercial properties in the United States, Spain, and the United Kingdom which are subject to NNN Leases. Cramer noted on an August 30 Mad Money segment that:“The stock’s been punished lately because most retail has been struggling.”He observed that Realty Income Corporation (NYSE:O) has “tons of consistent clients” like drugstores, supermarkets, dollar stores, and convenience stores. He further added: “Best of all, Realty Income pays you a monthly dividend that yields 4.3% here.”Supporting Realty Income Corporation (NYSE:O) further, he said on a September 14 segment of Mad Money:“As long as their tenants stay in business, they won’t take much of a hit financially. To me, that looks like an opportunity.”On December 13, Realty Income Corporation (NYSE:O) declared a $0.2485 per share monthly dividend, a 0.2% increase from its prior dividend of $0.248. The dividend is payable on January 13, 2023 to shareholders of record on January 3. The forward yield was 4.60%. The firm has a history of increasing dividend payouts for 28 consecutive years. According to Insider Monkey’s data, Realty Income Corporation (NYSE:O) was part of 28 hedge fund portfolios at the end of Q3 2022, up from 19 in the prior quarter. Stuart J. Zimmer’s Zimmer Partners is the largest position holder in the company, with 2.90 million shares worth $169 million. 8. Hormel Foods Corporation (NYSE:HRL)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 29Dividend Yield as of December 16: 2.41%Hormel Foods Corporation (NYSE:HRL) was founded in 1891 and is headquartered in Austin, Minnesota. The company develops, processes, and distributes meat, nuts, and food products to retail, foodservice, deli, and commercial customers in the United States and internationally. The company operates through four segments – Grocery Products, Refrigerated Foods, Jennie-O Turkey Store, and International &amp; Other. Jim Cramer said on his Mad Money segment on August 30 that Hormel Foods Corporation (NYSE:HRL) is a classic defensive name, noting that as inflation crushed consumers, Hormel could be “a good trade-down play.”On December 1, Cramer was in conversation with Hormel Foods Corporation (NYSE:HRL)’s CEO, discussing the company's negative Q4 organic volume growth and the recent dividend increase. The CEO reassured Cramer that the company is dedicated to protecting and increasing its dividend payouts, which may not look huge, but it has consistently increased payouts for the last 57 years. Hormel also has a fortress balance sheet and the negative growth is easily compensated by the strong cash position and dividend growth. Hormel Foods Corporation (NYSE:HRL) still remains one of Cramer’s favorite dividend aristocrats. Hormel Foods Corporation (NYSE:HRL) on November 21 declared a quarterly dividend of $0.275 per share, a 5.8% increase from its prior dividend of $0.26. The dividend is distributable on February 15, 2023 to shareholders of record on January 17. According to Insider Monkey’s data, 29 funds reported owning stakes worth $455.8 million in Hormel Foods Corporation (NYSE:HRL) at the end of September 2022, compared to 27 funds in the earlier quarter worth $434.5 million. Jim Simons’ Renaissance Technologies is the leading position holder in the company, with 2.3 million shares worth $106.3 million. Here is what LRT Capital Management has to say about Hormel Foods Corporation (NYSE:HRL) in its Q3 2021 investor letter:“Hormel Foods Corporation (HRL) – the maker of SPAM and Applegate Turkey (among many other products), is down over 20% since peaking last year, largely on fears of higher cost. We expect the company will be able to raise prices to offset cost inflation as they have always been able to win their past.”7. General Dynamics Corporation (NYSE:GD)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 35Dividend Yield as of December 16: 2.06%General Dynamics Corporation (NYSE:GD) was founded in 1899 and is headquartered in Reston, Virginia. It operates as an aerospace and defense company worldwide, and it has four segments – Aerospace, Marine Systems, Combat Systems, and Technologies. On Mad Money’s August-end segment, Jim Cramer said that he is optimistic about the defense industry overall, but General Dynamics Corporation (NYSE:GD) is the only dividend aristocrat in the sector. He told viewers: “Unfortunately, they also have a business jet division that will no doubt get hit if we have a nasty recession, but that hasn’t stopped the stock from rallying 11% this year, aided by a very hands-on management that knows what’s needed in a less secure world.”Cramer also backed General Dynamics Corporation (NYSE:GD) in a May 2020 segment of Mad Money, saying: “You have to take a long view on GD ’cause it’s not the favorite one right now. It’s not the loved one and the whole group is a little under pressure, but I think General Dynamics is a very good long-term hold.”On December 7, General Dynamics Corporation (NYSE:GD) declared a $1.26 per share quarterly dividend, in line with previous. The dividend is payable on February 10, 2023 to shareholders of record on January 20. The quarterly dividend was increased by 6% in 2022 to stretch General Dynamics’ dividend hike streak to 26 years. According to Insider Monkey’s data, General Dynamics Corporation (NYSE:GD) was part of 35 hedge fund portfolios at the end of September 2022, compared to 42 in the prior quarter. James A. Star’s Longview Asset Management is the leading position holder in the company, with 30 million shares worth $6.4 billion. Here is what Oakmark Global Fund has to say about General Dynamics Corporation (NYSE:GD) in their Q1 2021 investor letter:“The second new U.S. equity purchase was General Dynamics, a leading U.S. defense contractor and owner of the world’s premier business jet franchise (Gulfstream). We were able to purchase this high-quality and durable business at a meaningful discount to our estimate of its intrinsic value after a series of near-term concerns hurt its share price. Taking a longer term view, the company’s business jet franchise should benefit from a multi-year investment program in new, differentiated products. Also, its free cash flow conversion is set to improve materially and the company is poised to benefit from a highly visible ramp up in revenue related to next generation nuclear-powered submarines. As these positives come into clearer view, we expect sentiment to improve, along with the company’s share price.”6. Archer-Daniels-Midland Company (NYSE:ADM)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 37Dividend Yield as of December 16: 1.73%Archer-Daniels-Midland Company (NYSE:ADM) procures, transports, processes, and merchandises agricultural commodities in the United States, Switzerland, Cayman Islands, Brazil, Mexico, the United Kingdom, and internationally. The company operates through three segments – Ag Services and Oilseeds, Carbohydrate Solutions, and Nutrition. Jim Cramer told viewers on August 30 that he likes Archer-Daniels-Midland Company (NYSE:ADM) and the potential upside from supply chain disruptions. He also said that the stock has started to rebound from its mid-July bottom, driven by a recovery in crop prices. He called it a “conservative, decent stock.”Jim Cramer reinforced his prior Archer-Daniels-Midland Company (NYSE:ADM) thesis on a December 14 segment of Mad Money, saying that the stock is the best performer in consumer staples space so far this year, and is a winner as long as the Russia-Ukraine war continues. He categorized it as one of the top five consumer staple stocks for 2023.According to Insider Monkey’s Q3 data, 37 hedge funds were long Archer-Daniels-Midland Company (NYSE:ADM), compared to 42 funds in the earlier quarter. Tom Gayner’s Markel Gayner Asset Management is the leading position holder in the company, with nearly 1.5 million shares worth $117.7 million. In addition to The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO), Caterpillar Inc. (NYSE:CAT), and McDonald's Corporation (NYSE:MCD), Archer-Daniels-Midland Company (NYSE:ADM) is one of the favorite dividend aristocrats of Jim Cramer. Here is what Diamond Hill Long-Short Fund has to say about Archer-Daniels-Midland Company (NYSE:ADM) in its Q1 2022 investor letter:“ADM is a leading agricultural processor that also operates a global nutrition business focused on the development of ingredients and flavors for food and beverages, supplements and more. The company’s recent operating results have benefited (unfortunately) from the war in Ukraine as grain prices and agricultural markets globally experienced strong price increases. ADM is positioned well to benefit from the volatility due to its stable North American agricultural base.” Click to continue reading and see Jim Cramer's 5 Favorite Dividend Aristocrats.  Suggested articles:15 Biggest Endowments in the US10 Best Tobacco Stocks To Buy12 Dividend Stocks That Outperform S&amp;P 500 Disclosure: None.

Biden administration: A little at a time.And that’s how it began, with an announcement that seemed timed with the one-year low in crude prices. The U.S. Department of Energy said on Friday it will start refilling the nation’s heavily drawn-down Strategic Petroleum Reserve, or SPR, from February with an initial purchase of 3 million barrels.News of the SPR’s refilling came amid a renewed hawkish tone for interest rates from the Federal Reserve, European Central Bank and the Bank of England. The stance of the global central banks dampened risk appetite across markets and heightened recession fears, cutting short a rally in crude prices that came just after the worst week for oil in nine months.The Biden administration drew some 200 million barrels from the SPR over the past year, sending inventories in the reserve to 38-year lows, as it attempted to bridge a global supply deficit in crude caused by Russian President Vladimir Putin’s decision to invade Ukraine and the West’s subsequent sanctions on Moscow.Reliance on the SPR accelerated after the White House approved a 180-million barrel draw over a six-month period beginning May. U.S. crude surged to just above $130 a barrel in the first week of March while global benchmark Brent hit almost $140, shortly after the Ukraine invasion began. The 14-year highs in crude prices then and the sanctions on Russia combined to eventually send U.S. pump prices of gasoline to hit record highs of $5 per gallon by June.As of Friday though, U.S. crude settled at under $75 per barrel and Brent at below $80. Gasoline at U.S. pumps averaged $3.18 per gallon, according to the American Automobile Association — although some areas in the United States with refineries in their proximity were pricing a gallon at under $3 due to cheaper costs of moving the fuel.Oil bulls had been anticipating a major swing up in crude prices from any attempts to refill the SPR and the Biden administration has said for a while that it aimed to pay around $70 a barrel for the deed — well below the three-digit pricing expected by those long the market.Story continuesSeventy dollars a barrel is “a good price for companies and it's a good price for taxpayers"", the president himself was quoted saying on Oct. 19 when asked how much the government intended to pay to bring SPR stockpiles back to their previous threshold of around 700 million barrels. As of a week ago, the reserve held just over 382 million barrels, its lowest level since March 1984.When Biden spoke about $70 oil, U.S. crude was trading at around $85 a barrel. Many thought it would go to $100 from there, not drop by another $10 to $15.Any positive impact from the SPR’s refilling was further watered down on Friday by an administration official saying the reserve would also loan out 2 million barrels to domestic energy companies to relieve any supply shortage caused by the Keystone pipeline’s closure.The 622,000 barrel-per-day Keystone pipeline is a critical artery shipping heavy Canadian crude from Alberta to U.S. refiners in the Midwest and the Gulf Coast. It has been closed for a week now, after causing what officials say is the largest U.S. oil spill in a decade.Under the loan arrangement reported Friday, companies will immediately receive 2 million barrels from the SPR to resolve the supply crunch emanating from the Keystone crisis and return them much later, at a mutually-agreed time.“It’s a smart hedge, if you ask me,” John Kilduff, a partner at New York energy hedge fund Again Capital, said, referring to the two countervailing decisions involving the SPR.“Instead of announcing a massive purchase that would take care of the entire 180 million barrels that were drawn down the last six months, the administration chose to just begin with a 3 million barrel purchase. The positive impact on the market will be minimal, just as U.S. consumers at the pump would have liked.”It was a sign of the administration’s resolve to continue using the SPR as a mechanism to keep oil prices low, as well as fix supply problems in the marketplace. Biden’s critics say the reserve was never meant to be a price-fighting tool. The president says his priority is providing relief to Americans suffering from the worst inflation in 40 years.So, here’s the other question: Did the administration effectively check-mate oil longs with its SPR announcement?Yes, for now. Though it’s never a good idea to bet on oil prices staying this way for too long, simply because of supply-demand dynamics.Crude prices could surge if the oncoming cold snap during the Christmas week and beyond sends heating demand through the roof. They could also bolt upright from any Putin idea of slashing Russian production (though he seems to need the money from oil now, the way he’s happy supplying as many barrels as needed by India, which is complying with the G7’s $60 price cap on each barrel of Russian sea-borne crude).Conversely, crude prices could fall further, to mid-$60 levels for WTI and just under $70 for Brent, if the COVID crisis gets out of hand again in China, the world’s largest oil importer. Beijing reopened cities that were under lockdown and rolled back safeguards against the coronavirus last week amid public protests against its tough Zero-COVID policy.With the relaxing of China’s health rules, experts say up to 60% of the population could eventually be infected with the virus, and a January peak could hit vulnerable people such as the elderly and those with pre-existing conditions. They worry about China’s large pool of susceptible individuals, the use of less effective vaccines, and low vaccine coverage among those 80 and older, who are at the greatest risk of severe disease.“If COVID spreads freely and many people cannot get care, we estimate that in the coming months 1.5 million Chinese people will die from the virus,” The Economist said.China’s oil demand could suffer as well. “People’s will to go out may still be conservative in the next one or two months as most cities have yet to see big outbreaks,” Zhang Xiao, an analyst at OilChem, said in comments carried by Bloomberg. He added that gasoline usage may actually drop near term as people opt to stay home to avoid infection or to recover “The market will wait at least till March to see a recovery in gasoline demand.”It’s going to be an interesting Christmas and New Year for oil.Oil: Market Settlements and Activity U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude for delivery in January did a final trade of $74.50, after officially settling Friday’s trade at $74.29, down $1.82, or 2.4%.Earlier on Friday, WTI, as the U.S. crude benchmark is known, hit an intraday low of $73.33. For the week, it rose 4% after an 11% drop last week, like Brent. WTI fell to as low as $70.11 a week ago — hitting a bottom not seen since Dec 21, 2021.U.K. origin Brent crude for delivery in February did a final trade of $79.26, after officially settling Friday’s trade at $79.04, down $2.17, or 2.7%.Earlier on Friday, Brent hit a session low of $78.29. For the week though, the global crude benchmark was up 3.9% after the 11% slump in the week prior that took a barrel of Brent to as low as $75.14 — a bottom not seen since Dec 23, 2021.Oil Price Technical Outlook: WTIGoing into the week ahead, a sustained move above $73 will keep WTI’s chances valid for a further retest of the $77 level, said Sunil Kumar Dixit, chief technical strategist at SKCharting.com.“A strong consolidation above $78 will help extend gains to the psychological handle of $80 and the 100-Week SMA of $82,” Dixit said, referring to the Simple Moving Average.But he cautioned that a break and consolidation below $73 will prompt a retest of WTI’s $70 support base.“If this support base is decisively broken, it exposes WTI to major correctional target-cum-support at the 200-Week SMA of $65.10,” Dixit said.Gold: Market Settlements and Activity Gold futures’ benchmark February contract on New York’s Comex did a final trade of $1,803 after officially settling Friday’s trade at $1,800.20, up $12.40, or 0.7%.Earlier on Friday, February gold hit a session peak of $1,804.20. Earlier in the week, the benchmark gold futures contract hit a six-month high of $1,836.80. Despite the daily rise, for the week, February gold fell 0.6%.The spot price of gold, which is more closely followed than futures by some traders, settled below the $1,800 mark, finishing up $16.41, or 0.9%. Spot gold’s peak for the week was $1,824.53, the highest in six months. For the week itself, spot gold slipped 0.2%.Traders attributed the softer weekly sentiment in gold to the renewed hawkish tone of the Fed and other central banks that sent the dollar higher in the last two days of the week, after the currency’s drop in the first three days.“It seems bullion traders won’t have the green light to buy gold until they are confident that the peak in yields is in place,” said Ed Moya, analyst at online trading platform OANDA. “Eventually, Wall Street will feel confident that the Fed is ready to hold and that might be when gold will be able to resume its role as a safe haven.”“As trading volumes ease into year-end, gold might find itself stuck in a range that could see $1,750 as support and $1,830 as major resistance.”Gold Technical Outlook: Spot Price Spot gold’s second weekly settlement below the 100-week SMA of $1,800 calls for some caution for bullion bulls, said Dixit.“If gold fails to establish its acceptance above the $1,800 level, the risk of a break below $1,788 and $1,773 will increase. If this happens, it can trigger a correction sell-off towards $1,765-$1,745 and which can even extend towards $1,722.”On the positive side, a strong consolidation above $1,800 will help spot gold retest $1,824, Dixit said. “This can extend the rally towards $1,842, possibly setting a new six-month high thereon,” he added.Disclaimer: Barani Krishnan does not hold positions in the commodities and securities he writes about.Related ArticlesIranian oil workers protest for higher wages -social mediaSunak scraps Energy Supply Taskforce introduced by Truss- Sky News]"

(NYSE:CRM)?",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/now-opportune-moment-examine-salesforce-120034260.html,1671364834,STORY,['CRM'],"[Let's talk about the popular Salesforce, Inc. (NYSE:CRM). The company's shares received a lot of attention from a substantial price movement on the NYSE over the last few months, increasing to US$166 at one point, and dropping to the lows of US$128. Some share price movements can give investors a better opportunity to enter into the stock, and potentially buy at a lower price. A question to answer is whether Salesforce's current trading price of US$128 reflective of the actual value of the large-cap? Or is it currently undervalued, providing us with the opportunity to buy? Let’s take a look at Salesforce’s outlook and value based on the most recent financial data to see if there are any catalysts for a price change. See our latest analysis for Salesforce Is Salesforce Still Cheap?Good news, investors! Salesforce is still a bargain right now. According to my valuation, the intrinsic value for the stock is $201.64, which is above what the market is valuing the company at the moment. This indicates a potential opportunity to buy low. However, given that Salesforce’s share is fairly volatile (i.e. its price movements are magnified relative to the rest of the market) this could mean the price can sink lower, giving us another chance to buy in the future. This is based on its high beta, which is a good indicator for share price volatility.Can we expect growth from Salesforce?earnings-and-revenue-growthFuture outlook is an important aspect when you’re looking at buying a stock, especially if you are an investor looking for growth in your portfolio. Although value investors would argue that it’s the intrinsic value relative to the price that matter the most, a more compelling investment thesis would be high growth potential at a cheap price. Salesforce's earnings over the next few years are expected to double, indicating a very optimistic future ahead. This should lead to stronger cash flows, feeding into a higher share value.What This Means For YouAre you a shareholder? Since CRM is currently undervalued, it may be a great time to increase your holdings in the stock. With a positive outlook on the horizon, it seems like this growth has not yet been fully factored into the share price. However, there are also other factors such as capital structure to consider, which could explain the current undervaluation.Story continuesAre you a potential investor? If you’ve been keeping an eye on CRM for a while, now might be the time to make a leap. Its prosperous future outlook isn’t fully reflected in the current share price yet, which means it’s not too late to buy CRM. But before you make any investment decisions, consider other factors such as the track record of its management team, in order to make a well-informed buy.In light of this, if you'd like to do more analysis on the company, it's vital to be informed of the risks involved.

If you want to see more stocks in this selection, check out Jim Cramer's 5 Favorite Dividend Aristocrats. Jim Cramer, the host of Mad Money on CNBC and an anchor on Squawk on the Street, is one of the most followed television personalities commenting on Wall Street equities. At the end of August this year, Cramer put out a list of his 10 favorite “dividend aristocrats” to buy and hold throughout 2022, noting that their dividend payouts provide a safe haven against Federal Reserve policies and consequent market declines. Cramer observed that dividend aristocrats, which are members of the S&amp;P 500 Index with a history of increasing dividends consistently for at least 25 years, have fared better than the broader U.S. stock index. On December 16, Cramer attempted to address the primary investor concern regarding the United States slipping into a recession in the coming year. He told his viewers on Mad Money: “We want the Fed to talk a big game, without needing to actually do too much. Talk is better than action. We want [Fed Chair Jerome Powell] to scare the economy into slowing under its own weight. We don’t want endless rate hikes ... that will destroy everything in its path.”Jim Cramer made these comments in light of the Fed raising interest rates by half a percentage point to their highest levels in 15 years on December 14. The S&amp;P 500 was also down 5.6% in December, continuing its losing streak for weeks. In this market environment, some of the dividend aristocrats favored by Jim Cramer for 2022 include The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO), Caterpillar Inc. (NYSE:CAT), and McDonald's Corporation (NYSE:MCD). Our MethodologyWe explored the 10 dividend aristocrats that Jim Cramer listed as his favorites on an August 30 segment of CNBC’s Mad Money. We have also mentioned the comments he made about these stocks after August 30, to see whether he stands by his original bullish thesis for all these names. We have assessed the hedge fund sentiment from Insider Monkey’s database of 920 elite hedge funds tracked as of the end of the third quarter of 2022. The list is arranged according to the number of hedge fund holders in each firm. Story continuesJim Cramer's Favorite Dividend AristocratsJim Cramer's Favorite Dividend Aristocrats10. Federal Realty Investment Trust (NYSE:FRT)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 24Dividend Yield as of December 16: 4.13%Federal Realty Investment Trust (NYSE:FRT) is a leader in the ownership and operation of high quality retail properties located in primary coastal markets ranging from Washington to Boston, as well as San Francisco and Los Angeles. Federal Realty Investment Trust (NYSE:FRT) aims to distribute long-term, sustainable growth through investing in areas where retail demand outpaces supply. CNBC’s Jim Cramer said in an episode of Mad Money on August 30 that the REIT yields about 4.2% and owns huge suburban retail properties. The reason Federal Realty Investment Trust (NYSE:FRT) featured as one of Cramer’s favorite dividend aristocrats was because the kind of properties it owns and leases remain resilient despite economic weakness. On September 14, Jim Cramer reiterated his support for Federal Realty Investment Trust (NYSE:FRT), saying:“While most retail stocks are horrible right now … the companies that own the best retail real estate are doing just fine.” On November 3, Federal Realty Investment Trust (NYSE:FRT) reported a Q3 FFO of $1.59 and a revenue of $273.45 million, outperforming Wall Street estimates by $0.06 and $12.29 million, respectively. The company raised its full-year 2022 earnings per diluted share guidance to $3.88-$3.93 and increased full-year FFO per diluted share guidance to $6.27 - $6.32 from the prior outlook of $6.10-$6.25 and a $6.21 consensus. According to Insider Monkey’s data, 24 hedge funds reported owning stakes worth $132 million in Federal Realty Investment Trust (NYSE:FRT) at the end of Q3 2022, compared to the same number of funds in the prior quarter worth $200 million. Like The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO), Caterpillar Inc. (NYSE:CAT), and McDonald's Corporation (NYSE:MCD), Federal Realty Investment Trust (NYSE:FRT) is one of the dividend aristocrats backed by Jim Cramer. 9. Realty Income Corporation (NYSE:O)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 28Dividend Yield as of December 16: 4.61%Realty Income Corporation (NYSE:O) is an S&amp;P 500 company that seeks to deliver shareholders with dependable monthly income. It is a California-based company that invests in free-standing, single-tenant commercial properties in the United States, Spain, and the United Kingdom which are subject to NNN Leases. Cramer noted on an August 30 Mad Money segment that:“The stock’s been punished lately because most retail has been struggling.”He observed that Realty Income Corporation (NYSE:O) has “tons of consistent clients” like drugstores, supermarkets, dollar stores, and convenience stores. He further added: “Best of all, Realty Income pays you a monthly dividend that yields 4.3% here.”Supporting Realty Income Corporation (NYSE:O) further, he said on a September 14 segment of Mad Money:“As long as their tenants stay in business, they won’t take much of a hit financially. To me, that looks like an opportunity.”On December 13, Realty Income Corporation (NYSE:O) declared a $0.2485 per share monthly dividend, a 0.2% increase from its prior dividend of $0.248. The dividend is payable on January 13, 2023 to shareholders of record on January 3. The forward yield was 4.60%. The firm has a history of increasing dividend payouts for 28 consecutive years. According to Insider Monkey’s data, Realty Income Corporation (NYSE:O) was part of 28 hedge fund portfolios at the end of Q3 2022, up from 19 in the prior quarter. Stuart J. Zimmer’s Zimmer Partners is the largest position holder in the company, with 2.90 million shares worth $169 million. 8. Hormel Foods Corporation (NYSE:HRL)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 29Dividend Yield as of December 16: 2.41%Hormel Foods Corporation (NYSE:HRL) was founded in 1891 and is headquartered in Austin, Minnesota. The company develops, processes, and distributes meat, nuts, and food products to retail, foodservice, deli, and commercial customers in the United States and internationally. The company operates through four segments – Grocery Products, Refrigerated Foods, Jennie-O Turkey Store, and International &amp; Other. Jim Cramer said on his Mad Money segment on August 30 that Hormel Foods Corporation (NYSE:HRL) is a classic defensive name, noting that as inflation crushed consumers, Hormel could be “a good trade-down play.”On December 1, Cramer was in conversation with Hormel Foods Corporation (NYSE:HRL)’s CEO, discussing the company's negative Q4 organic volume growth and the recent dividend increase. The CEO reassured Cramer that the company is dedicated to protecting and increasing its dividend payouts, which may not look huge, but it has consistently increased payouts for the last 57 years. Hormel also has a fortress balance sheet and the negative growth is easily compensated by the strong cash position and dividend growth. Hormel Foods Corporation (NYSE:HRL) still remains one of Cramer’s favorite dividend aristocrats. Hormel Foods Corporation (NYSE:HRL) on November 21 declared a quarterly dividend of $0.275 per share, a 5.8% increase from its prior dividend of $0.26. The dividend is distributable on February 15, 2023 to shareholders of record on January 17. According to Insider Monkey’s data, 29 funds reported owning stakes worth $455.8 million in Hormel Foods Corporation (NYSE:HRL) at the end of September 2022, compared to 27 funds in the earlier quarter worth $434.5 million. Jim Simons’ Renaissance Technologies is the leading position holder in the company, with 2.3 million shares worth $106.3 million. Here is what LRT Capital Management has to say about Hormel Foods Corporation (NYSE:HRL) in its Q3 2021 investor letter:“Hormel Foods Corporation (HRL) – the maker of SPAM and Applegate Turkey (among many other products), is down over 20% since peaking last year, largely on fears of higher cost. We expect the company will be able to raise prices to offset cost inflation as they have always been able to win their past.”7. General Dynamics Corporation (NYSE:GD)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 35Dividend Yield as of December 16: 2.06%General Dynamics Corporation (NYSE:GD) was founded in 1899 and is headquartered in Reston, Virginia. It operates as an aerospace and defense company worldwide, and it has four segments – Aerospace, Marine Systems, Combat Systems, and Technologies. On Mad Money’s August-end segment, Jim Cramer said that he is optimistic about the defense industry overall, but General Dynamics Corporation (NYSE:GD) is the only dividend aristocrat in the sector. He told viewers: “Unfortunately, they also have a business jet division that will no doubt get hit if we have a nasty recession, but that hasn’t stopped the stock from rallying 11% this year, aided by a very hands-on management that knows what’s needed in a less secure world.”Cramer also backed General Dynamics Corporation (NYSE:GD) in a May 2020 segment of Mad Money, saying: “You have to take a long view on GD ’cause it’s not the favorite one right now. It’s not the loved one and the whole group is a little under pressure, but I think General Dynamics is a very good long-term hold.”On December 7, General Dynamics Corporation (NYSE:GD) declared a $1.26 per share quarterly dividend, in line with previous. The dividend is payable on February 10, 2023 to shareholders of record on January 20. The quarterly dividend was increased by 6% in 2022 to stretch General Dynamics’ dividend hike streak to 26 years. According to Insider Monkey’s data, General Dynamics Corporation (NYSE:GD) was part of 35 hedge fund portfolios at the end of September 2022, compared to 42 in the prior quarter. James A. Star’s Longview Asset Management is the leading position holder in the company, with 30 million shares worth $6.4 billion. Here is what Oakmark Global Fund has to say about General Dynamics Corporation (NYSE:GD) in their Q1 2021 investor letter:“The second new U.S. equity purchase was General Dynamics, a leading U.S. defense contractor and owner of the world’s premier business jet franchise (Gulfstream). We were able to purchase this high-quality and durable business at a meaningful discount to our estimate of its intrinsic value after a series of near-term concerns hurt its share price. Taking a longer term view, the company’s business jet franchise should benefit from a multi-year investment program in new, differentiated products. Also, its free cash flow conversion is set to improve materially and the company is poised to benefit from a highly visible ramp up in revenue related to next generation nuclear-powered submarines. As these positives come into clearer view, we expect sentiment to improve, along with the company’s share price.”6. Archer-Daniels-Midland Company (NYSE:ADM)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 37Dividend Yield as of December 16: 1.73%Archer-Daniels-Midland Company (NYSE:ADM) procures, transports, processes, and merchandises agricultural commodities in the United States, Switzerland, Cayman Islands, Brazil, Mexico, the United Kingdom, and internationally. The company operates through three segments – Ag Services and Oilseeds, Carbohydrate Solutions, and Nutrition. Jim Cramer told viewers on August 30 that he likes Archer-Daniels-Midland Company (NYSE:ADM) and the potential upside from supply chain disruptions. He also said that the stock has started to rebound from its mid-July bottom, driven by a recovery in crop prices. He called it a “conservative, decent stock.”Jim Cramer reinforced his prior Archer-Daniels-Midland Company (NYSE:ADM) thesis on a December 14 segment of Mad Money, saying that the stock is the best performer in consumer staples space so far this year, and is a winner as long as the Russia-Ukraine war continues. He categorized it as one of the top five consumer staple stocks for 2023.According to Insider Monkey’s Q3 data, 37 hedge funds were long Archer-Daniels-Midland Company (NYSE:ADM), compared to 42 funds in the earlier quarter. Tom Gayner’s Markel Gayner Asset Management is the leading position holder in the company, with nearly 1.5 million shares worth $117.7 million. In addition to The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO), Caterpillar Inc. (NYSE:CAT), and McDonald's Corporation (NYSE:MCD), Archer-Daniels-Midland Company (NYSE:ADM) is one of the favorite dividend aristocrats of Jim Cramer. Here is what Diamond Hill Long-Short Fund has to say about Archer-Daniels-Midland Company (NYSE:ADM) in its Q1 2022 investor letter:“ADM is a leading agricultural processor that also operates a global nutrition business focused on the development of ingredients and flavors for food and beverages, supplements and more. The company’s recent operating results have benefited (unfortunately) from the war in Ukraine as grain prices and agricultural markets globally experienced strong price increases. ADM is positioned well to benefit from the volatility due to its stable North American agricultural base.” Click to continue reading and see Jim Cramer's 5 Favorite Dividend Aristocrats.  Suggested articles:15 Biggest Endowments in the US10 Best Tobacco Stocks To Buy12 Dividend Stocks That Outperform S&amp;P 500 Disclosure: None.

Given its impressive performance, we decided to study the company's key financial indicators as a company's long-term fundamentals usually dictate market outcomes. In this article, we decided to focus on Synopsys'  ROE.Return on Equity or ROE is a test of how effectively a company is growing its value and managing investors’ money. In other words, it is a profitability ratio which measures the rate of return on the capital provided by the company's shareholders. Check out our latest analysis for Synopsys How To Calculate Return On Equity?The formula for return on equity is:Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' EquitySo, based on the above formula, the ROE for Synopsys is:18% = US$978m ÷ US$5.6b (Based on the trailing twelve months to October 2022).The 'return' is the yearly profit. Another way to think of that is that for every $1 worth of equity, the company was able to earn $0.18 in profit.What Has ROE Got To Do With Earnings Growth?We have already established that ROE serves as an efficient profit-generating gauge for a company's future earnings. Depending on how much of these profits the company reinvests or ""retains"", and how effectively it does so, we are then able to assess a company’s earnings growth potential. Assuming all else is equal, companies that have both a higher return on equity and higher profit retention are usually the ones that have a higher growth rate when compared to companies that don't have the same features.A Side By Side comparison of Synopsys' Earnings Growth And 18% ROETo begin with, Synopsys seems to have a respectable ROE. Especially when compared to the industry average of 12% the company's ROE looks pretty impressive. Probably as a result of this, Synopsys was able to see an impressive net income growth of 31% over the last five years. However, there could also be other causes behind this growth. For instance, the company has a low payout ratio or is being managed efficiently.Story continuesNext, on comparing with the industry net income growth, we found that Synopsys' growth is quite high when compared to the industry average growth of 24% in the same period, which is great to see.past-earnings-growthEarnings growth is a huge factor in stock valuation. What investors need to determine next is if the expected earnings growth, or the lack of it, is already built into the share price. Doing so will help them establish if the stock's future looks promising or ominous. One good indicator of expected earnings growth is the P/E ratio which determines the price the market is willing to pay for a stock based on its earnings prospects. So, you may want to check if Synopsys is trading on a high P/E or a low P/E, relative to its industry.Is Synopsys Efficiently Re-investing Its Profits?Given that Synopsys doesn't pay any dividend to its shareholders, we infer that the company has been reinvesting all of its profits to grow its business.ConclusionIn total, we are pretty happy with Synopsys' performance. Specifically, we like that the company is reinvesting a huge chunk of its profits at a high rate of return. This of course has caused the company to see substantial growth in its earnings. That being so, a study of the latest analyst forecasts show that the company is expected to see a slowdown in its future earnings growth.

27,de65060a-5b3f-3897-9f5b-0fb95dff6e77,PM,2022-12-18,Philip Morris International Inc. (NYSE:PM) Goes Ex-Dividend Soon,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/philip-morris-international-inc-nyse-125938750.html,1671368378,STORY,['PM'],"[Some investors rely on dividends for growing their wealth, and if you're one of those dividend sleuths, you might be intrigued to know that Philip Morris International Inc. (NYSE:PM) is about to go ex-dividend in just 2 days. The ex-dividend date occurs one day before the record date which is the day on which shareholders need to be on the company's books in order to receive a dividend. It is important to be aware of the ex-dividend date because any trade on the stock needs to have been settled on or before the record date. In other words, investors can purchase Philip Morris International's shares before the 21st of December in order to be eligible for the dividend, which will be paid on the 11th of January.The company's upcoming dividend is US$1.27 a share, following on from the last 12 months, when the company distributed a total of US$5.08 per share to shareholders. Calculating the last year's worth of payments shows that Philip Morris International has a trailing yield of 5.1% on the current share price of $100.28. We love seeing companies pay a dividend, but it's also important to be sure that laying the golden eggs isn't going to kill our golden goose! So we need to check whether the dividend payments are covered, and if earnings are growing. View our latest analysis for Philip Morris International Dividends are typically paid out of company income, so if a company pays out more than it earned, its dividend is usually at a higher risk of being cut. It paid out 89% of its earnings as dividends last year, which is not unreasonable, but limits reinvestment in the business and leaves the dividend vulnerable to a business downturn. We'd be worried about the risk of a drop in earnings. A useful secondary check can be to evaluate whether Philip Morris International generated enough free cash flow to afford its dividend. It paid out more than half (73%) of its free cash flow in the past year, which is within an average range for most companies.Story continuesIt's positive to see that Philip Morris International's dividend is covered by both profits and cash flow, since this is generally a sign that the dividend is sustainable, and a lower payout ratio usually suggests a greater margin of safety before the dividend gets cut.Click here to see the company's payout ratio, plus analyst estimates of its future dividends.historic-dividendHave Earnings And Dividends Been Growing?Businesses with strong growth prospects usually make the best dividend payers, because it's easier to grow dividends when earnings per share are improving. If business enters a downturn and the dividend is cut, the company could see its value fall precipitously. With that in mind, we're encouraged by the steady growth at Philip Morris International, with earnings per share up 4.7% on average over the last five years. A payout ratio of 89% looks like a tacit signal from management that reinvestment opportunities in the business are low. In line with limited earnings growth in recent years, this is not the most appealing combination.Another key way to measure a company's dividend prospects is by measuring its historical rate of dividend growth. In the last 10 years, Philip Morris International has lifted its dividend by approximately 5.1% a year on average. We're glad to see dividends rising alongside earnings over a number of years, which may be a sign the company intends to share the growth with shareholders.To Sum It UpShould investors buy Philip Morris International for the upcoming dividend? Earnings per share have been growing modestly and Philip Morris International paid out a bit over half of its earnings and free cash flow last year. In summary, while it has some positive characteristics, we're not inclined to race out and buy Philip Morris International today.If you're not too concerned about Philip Morris International's ability to pay dividends, you should still be mindful of some of the other risks that this business faces. For example - Philip Morris International has 1 warning sign we think you should be aware of.A common investing mistake is buying the first interesting stock you see.

If you want to see more best cheap stocks to buy now for long term, go directly to 5 Best Cheap Stocks to Buy Now for Long Term.To many investors, a cheap stock isn't a stock that's trading for a low stock price.Instead, a cheap stock is a stock of a company that is trading for considerably below its intrinsic value. A company's intrinsic value is what the company is really worth.Although there are exceptions, the intrinsic value of high quality companies with competitive advantages tend to go up in the long term as those companies grow their market share or launch new products or services. The earnings per share of those companies can go higher as those companies buy back their stock. Those high quality companies can also pay a dividend as a way to return capital back to shareholders.In the long term, quality stocks with competitive advantages tend to outperform stocks that might trade for lower valuations but don't have the same quality businesses.In the near term, however, some quality stocks might trade for lower valuations than they should given the market headwinds this year.2022In terms of 2022, there have been a lot of market headwinds for stocks given the Federal Reserve has raised interest rates seven times this year. As a result of the interest rate increases, the Federal Reserve's federal funds rate is now 4.25% to 4.5% and the U.S. central bank might not be done with the raises.According to projections released from the Federal Reserve during a December two day policy meeting, the U.S. central bank will raise interest rates past 5% next year.Given the interest rate increases, borrowing costs have increased and it is harder for some businesses to make money. With the higher rates, some businesses have seen softer demand and the overall valuation of the broader market has decreased as capital has moved from the equities market into Treasuries. With the higher interest rates, many economists think there could be a recession next year.Story continuesWith the lower overall market, the stocks of some high quality businesses are arguably fairly cheap given their future potential in the long term.Given the uncertainty, however, it could be a good idea for long term investors to own a well diversified portfolio of stocks across many different sectors.Pixabay/Public DomainMethodologyFor our list of 10 Best Cheap Stocks to Buy Now for Long Term, we picked 10 stocks with competitive advantages that arguably trade below their intrinsic value in the long term.We then ranked the 10 stocks based on the number of hedge funds in our database that held shares of the same stock at the end of Q3.For those of you interested, check out 12 Cheap Stocks to Buy That Outperformed in 2022.10 Best Cheap Stocks to Buy Now for Long Term10.

(NYSE:CCI) still benefits from 5G development in the U.S which could increase demand for the company's communications infrastructure in the long term.If demand remains strong, Crown Castle International Corp.

Given the increases, Wal-Mart continued to gain market share in the grocery sector, giving it even more scale to support its everyday low prices.In the third quarter, Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT) approved a new $20 billion share repurchase authorization to replace its existing authorization which had $1.9 billion remaining at the end of September.

We added leading financial institution Bank of America Corporation (NYSE:BAC) which serves individual consumers, small and middle-market businesses, and large corporations with a full range of banking, investing, asset management, and other financial and risk management products and services. The current company was formed through various mergers including NationsBank, FleetBoston, US Trust, Countrywide Financial, and Merrill Lynch with the legacy commercial bank to form a national banking powerhouse and bulge bracket investment firm. As one of the ‘Big Four’ U.S. banks it enjoys scale driven cost advantages and economies of scale which provide meaningful competitive advantages and potential for strong returns in the largely commoditized banking industry.

(NYSE:JPM)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 110Given many analysts think JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. (NYSE:JPM) is America's best big bank, the company has substantial earnings power and many competitive advantages.

(NYSE:JPM) could ultimately perform just as well or even better in the long term given its strong business. If it makes the profits that analysts think it can, JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co.

In fact, Buffett has done more buying of stocks over the past year than at anytime since the Great Recession, spending  almost $66 billion on stocks in the first nine months of the year. Following on the Oracle of Omaha’s lead, here are seven stocks to buy on the dip as the S&amp;P 500 continues to falter.GMGeneral Motors$37.62AMZNAmazon$88.45MRNAModerna$207.25MCDMcDonald’s$271.73TJXTJX Companies$78.66NVDANvidia$169.52CMGChipotle Mexican Grill$1,487.53Stocks to Buy on the Dip: General Motors (GM)Image of General Motors logo on corporate building with clear sky in the background.Source: Katherine Welles / Shutterstock.comThere’s a very compelling case to be made for buying shares of General Motors (NYSE:GM) on the dip. For one, the nuts and bolts of the stock are attractive. Tw0, the share price is down 36% on the year and trading at $37.62, about the same level it was at in 2019 before the pandemic. A price-earnings ratio of 6.39 is rock bottom for a company of GM’s size. And while a quarterly dividend payment of nine cents per share isn’t overly generous, it is better than nothing.General Motors has traveled a bumpy road over the past year. Supply chain problems made it difficult for the company to source needed parts and complete vehicles on time, and ongoing Covid-19 lockdowns in China dented its global sales. For this year’s third quarter, GM reported revenue of $41.89 billion, which was slightly below Wall Street forecasts for $42.22 billion. However, its earnings per share of $2.25 were well ahead of analyst calls for $1.88.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsDespite the rough road, General Motors continues to plow ahead with its company-wide conversion to electric vehicles. In fact, GM chief executive officer (CEO) Mary Barra recently said that the company now expects electric vehicle profits to be comparable to gas vehicle profits by 2025, years ahead of schedule. In all, GM is investing $35 billion to electrify its fleet of cars, trucks and SUVs. It makes our list of top stocks to buy on the dip.Story continuesStocks to Buy on the Dip: Amazon (AMZN)Closeup of the Amazon logo at Amazon campus in Palo Alto, California. The Palo Alto location hosts A9 Search, Amazon Web Services, and Amazon Game Studios teams. AMZN stockSource: Tada Images / Shutterstock.comAnother one of the top stocks to buy on the dip is Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), which Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) just named as one of its favorite stocks for 2023. In fact, analysts at the firm see the Seattle-based e-commerce giant turning a corner in the year ahead after a difficult 2022. A year where it was forced to right size its operations coming out of the pandemic, layoff staff, and cancel several projects that were in development.If Goldman’s bullish forecast proves true, investors would be wise to buy the dip in AMZN stock now while it is comparatively cheap. The company’s share price is down 45% this year. The depreciation, combined with a 20-for-1 stock split this past June, has Amazon’s stock trading for $88 a share, its most affordable level in more than a decade. A year ago, the stock was trading near $2,000.While the price-earnings ratio of just under 82 is a bit rich and Amazon doesn’t pay a dividend, the stock is still worth picking up at its current price given its long-term earnings potential and the fact that it controls nearly half (50%) of the U.S. e-commerce market. Second place eBay (NASDAQ:EBAY) has a 6.6% market share.Stocks to Buy on the Dip: Moderna (MRNA)A bunch of glass vials of SARS-CoV-2 vaccines. Vaccine stocksSource: ShutterstockJust recently, Moderna (NASDAQ:MRNA) jumped nearly 20% in a single trading day. All on news its experimental cancer vaccine reduced the recurrence of melanoma (a deadly form of skin cancer) by an impressive 44%. Moderna’s vaccine was used in combination with pharmaceutical company Merck &amp; Co.’s (NYSE:MRK) cancer immunotherapy Keytruda.The cancer vaccine’s promising results in a clinical trial help to answer the big question that has been hanging over Moderna and its stock all year: what’s next for the Boston-based company after its breakthrough Covid-19 vaccine? Moderna has forecast that it will sell $18 billion to $19 billion of its Covid-19 vaccine in 2022, which is great. But the knock on the company, until now, was that it had a thin pipeline. The Covid-19 shot was the first medication Moderna successfully commercialized.The uncertainty has weighed on MRNA stock, pulling it down 53% from a peak of just under $450 a share reached in Sept. 2021. Now at $207 a share and trading at 7.5x earnings, Moderna’s stock is attractively valued. In addition, if its new cancer vaccine takes off as expected, the stock could potentially see higher highs.Stocks to Buy on the Dip: McDonald’s (MCD)Source: ShutterstockShares of the Golden Arches company outperformed the broader market in 2022, up 2% on the year as compared to a 17% decline in the S&amp;P 500 index. McDonald’s (NYSE:MCD) is the type of reliable blue-chip stock that performs well in good times and bad. After all, people don’t stop eating at McDonald’s just because the economy is slowing down. The loyalty of McDonald’s customer base and its ability to raise prices without losing customers makes MCD stock a worthwhile long-term holding for investors.Currently, MCD stock is trading at just under $272 a share, has a price-earnings ratio of 34, and carries a dividend yield of 2.21%. McDonald’s also continues to innovate and diversify its menu in an effort to attract and retain customers. In addition to popular promotions like a farewell tour for the McRib, McDonald’s also recently began selling double cheeseburgers for only 50 cents each. Now that’s a deal that has to appeal to consumers who’ve been struggling with inflation and high interest rates.TJX Companies (TJX)Friends sit on a ledge with shopping bags after shopping retail stores.Source: Rawpixel.com / ShutterstockDiscount clothing retailer TJX Companies (NYSE:TJX) is another hedge against a possible recession in 2023. The stock has already performed well over the past 12 months, having risen 4% to trade at $78 a share. While that gain might appear modest, it is a lot better than the performance of the overall market, and better than other clothing retailers such as The Gap (NYSE:GPS) and Levi Strauss &amp; Co. (NYSE:LEVI) that are each down more than 25% in 2022.The key to TJX’s resiliency has been its discounts on name brand products through its store chains that include T.J. Maxx, HomeGoods, Sierra, and Marshalls. Offering 20% to 60% off retailers’ regular prices, TJX Companies appeals to price conscious consumers, especially during times of financial strain such as now. TJX reported that its third quarter EPS rose 8.3% from a year ago to 91 cents. Analysts have forecast that the company’s EPS can grow more than 10% annually over the next five years. TJX stock has a decent price-earnings ratio of 27.5 and carries a dividend yield of 1.49%.Nvidia (NVDA)Nvidia (NVDA) logo and sign on headquarters. Blurred foreground with green treesSource: Michael Vi / Shutterstock.comAfter being knocked down for most of the year, shares of semiconductor and microchip company Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) look to be on the mend heading into 2023. Over the past six months, NVDA stock has gained 7% to trade at $176. That said, the share price is still down 41% from the start of 2022, providing a nice entry point for investors who want exposure to a cutting edge technology name.The Santa Clara, California-based semiconductor company makes some of the most advanced chips in the world. Many of which are used to power supercomputers, artificial intelligence applications, video game consoles, and self-driving vehicles. Like other semiconductor companies, Nvidia has been hurt by supply chain bottlenecks and slowing demand for video game consoles coming out of the pandemic.Nvidia’s most recent earnings were mixed with its revenue coming at $5.93 billion, which was above expectations for $5.77 billion. But its EPS clocked in at 58 cents, which was below forecasts for 69 cents. A price-earnings ratio of 75 looks high at first glance. However, it’s in line with similar companies.

The quick service restaurant chain that specializes in Mexican cuisine is another stock that has fared better than the overall market throughout 2022. CMG stock is down 10% over the past 12 months, better than the S&amp;P 500 and many other restaurant securities. Like McDonald’s, Chipotle benefits from a loyal customer base and pricing power.The company has also continued with its expansion plans despite the turmoil of the Covid-19 pandemic and inflationary environment that followed it.  The Newport Beach, California-based company recently opened its 500th restaurant, with plenty more room to grow in existing and new markets, both in the U.S. and abroad. And even though it aggressively raised its prices this year, Chipotle managed to increase its comparable store sales by 7.6% in the third quarter, showing that consumers stick with the company through thick and thin.CMG stock is not cheap at $1,487 per share and with a price-earnings ratio of just over 50. However, Chipotle is hard to beat for investors who are looking for long-term growth stocks. Plus, the company could finally execute the stock split that has long been rumored.Disclosure: On the date of publication, Joel Baglole held long positions in GM and NVDA.

More often than not, we'll see a declining return on capital employed (ROCE) and a declining amount of capital employed. This indicates the company is producing less profit from its investments and its total assets are decreasing. And from a first read, things don't look too good at Public Service Enterprise Group (NYSE:PEG), so let's see why.What Is Return On Capital Employed (ROCE)?For those that aren't sure what ROCE is, it measures the amount of pre-tax profits a company can generate from the capital employed in its business. Analysts use this formula to calculate it for Public Service Enterprise Group:Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)0.044 = US$1.8b ÷ (US$48b - US$6.8b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to September 2022).Thus, Public Service Enterprise Group has an ROCE of 4.4%.  On its own, that's a low figure but it's around the 4.7% average generated by the Integrated Utilities industry. View our latest analysis for Public Service Enterprise Group roceAbove you can see how the current ROCE for Public Service Enterprise Group compares to its prior returns on capital, but there's only so much you can tell from the past. If you'd like, you can check out the forecasts from the analysts covering Public Service Enterprise Group here  for free.The Trend Of ROCEThere is reason to be cautious about Public Service Enterprise Group, given the returns are trending downwards. To be more specific, the ROCE was 6.9% five years ago, but since then it has dropped noticeably. And on the capital employed front, the business is utilizing roughly the same amount of capital as it was back then. This combination can be indicative of a mature business that still has areas to deploy capital, but the returns received aren't as high due potentially to new competition or smaller margins. So because these trends aren't typically conducive to creating a multi-bagger, we wouldn't hold our breath on Public Service Enterprise Group becoming one if things continue as they have.Story continuesOur Take On Public Service Enterprise Group's ROCEIn the end, the trend of lower returns on the same amount of capital isn't typically an indication that we're looking at a growth stock. In spite of that, the stock has delivered a 37% return to shareholders who held over the last five years. Regardless, we don't like the trends as they are and if they persist, we think you might find better investments elsewhere.One more thing: We've identified   3 warning signs  with Public Service Enterprise Group (at least 2 which are concerning)  , and understanding these would certainly be useful.If you want to search for solid companies with great earnings, check out this free list of companies with good balance sheets and impressive returns on equity.Have feedback on this article?

Most former leaders have been jailed or investigated for corruption.The situation has exploded in the last two weeks. Protesters have blocked highways, set buildings on fire and taken over airports in the wake of Castillo's Dec. 7 ouster, hours after he illegally tried to shutter Congress to avoid an impeachment vote he feared losing. At least 18 people have died.Many of the protesters - some Castillo supporters and others simply angry - said they felt ignored by political leaders. Castillo, a former teacher and son of peasant farmers, had at least been one of their own, they said, despite his many flaws.""Nobody represents me now,"" said Huamani, who blames Congress and new president Dina Boluarte, Castillo's former vice president, for the protest deaths. Many like him carry banners calling her a ""murderer"" and demanding she resign.The police and armed forces have been accused by rights groups of using deadly firearms and dropping smoke bombs from helicopters. The military says protesters, most in Peru's Andean south, have used homemade weapons and explosives.Boluarte, Peru's first female president and who can speak Andean indigenous language Quechua, has called for calm and implored Congress to bring forward elections. She has said she will not resign, despite the pressures.Story continues""She only represents the dead,"" Huamani added. ""We elected a humble rural teacher like us, hoping for a revolution that would bring the poor into power.""'NEST OF RATS'Castillo rose unexpectedly to the presidency last year on a wave of support from rural voters fed up with the status quo and what they saw as a corrupt Lima-based political elite.""I was chosen by the forgotten men and women of deep Peru, by the dispossessed who have been neglected for over 200 years,"" Castillo said in a handwritten letter from jail. He is serving 18 months of pretrial detention while being investigated for alleged crimes of rebellion and conspiracy, which he denies.He thanked his supporters for coming out on to the streets and accused the military and police of conducting what he called ""massacres"".""In this difficult context, the coup mongers, exploiting and starving us, today they want to silence my people,"" he wrote.A political rookie, he had won support with pledges to reform the constitution, redistribute huge copper riches and empower marginalized indigenous groups. On many of these promises he failed, his star waning before his ouster. He and his associates faced a spate of corruption probes and he went through five Cabinets and over 80 ministers in just 17 months.But his arrest has erased some of the disappointment. Hundreds of people from Peru's Amazonian jungle, mountain and rural regions have flocked to Lima in his support, including to the jail where he is being held.""The Peruvian people will rise and defend the popular vote,"" supporter Merina Chavez told Reuters outside the prison, aiming her ire at lawmakers. ""Congress did not let him do his job.""Castillo, who ran for the socialist Peru Libre party but later shifted towards the right, faced a hostile and fragmented legislature, where the conservative party of the candidate he narrowly defeated held the largest single bloc.He was impeached three times, the final time being voted out of office by a large majority after his attempt to dissolve Congress sparked resignations by ministers and accusations of a coup by former allies and constitutional officials.Most Peruvians, however, still blame the country's political woes on Congress. Seen as corrupt and self-serving, the parliament has an approval rating of only 11%, according to pollster Datum. Castillo's had been 24% before his removal.In a recent poll some 44% of Peruvians said they supported Castillo's attempt to dissolve the legislature, even though he tried to do it outside constitutional bounds.Outside the Lima jail, Katherine Asto had come to support Castillo wearing a white hat with a slogan making her feelings clear: ""Shut down Congress, it's a nest of rats"".(Reporting by Marco Aquino, Alexander Villegas and Liamar Ramos Writing by Adam Jourdan Editing by Daniel Wallis and Frances Kerry)]"

36,7cd74b4b-1d57-3514-abc8-a456e04b77cd,M,2022-12-18,4 Gold Stocks to Watch in a Promising Industry,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/4-gold-stocks-watch-promising-143502080.html,1671201302,STORY,['M'],"[The prospects for the Zacks Mining - Gold industry look bright at the moment on the back of improving gold prices. The yellow metal is likely to gain next year on improving demand, fears of a recession and geopolitical tensions.With gold prices anticipated to gain further on demand-supply imbalance, companies like Franco-Nevada Corporation FNV, Agnico Eagle Mines AEM, AngloGold Ashanti AU and Galiano Gold Inc. GAU are well-poised for growth, backed by their strong balance sheets, efforts to lower costs and growth initiatives.About the IndustryThe Zacks Mining - Gold industry mainly comprises companies engaged in extracting gold from mines. The mines may be either underground or open pits. Mining is a long and complex process, and requires significant financial resources. It involves exploration to evaluate the deposit's size, followed by assessing ways to extract and process the ore efficiently, safely and responsibly, and, finally, develop the mine before the actual mining process. It normally takes 10-20 years for a gold mine to produce material that can finally be refined. The players in the industry nowadays use a range of sophisticated techniques to extract gold and convert it into dore bars, an alloy of gold and silver, alongside other impurities. These are then sent for purification, following which gold is purchased in the forms of bars or coins or used in jewelry or for other purposes.What's Shaping the Future of the Mining-Gold IndustryGold Prices Regain Ground: The yellow metal started this year on a strong note, hitting a high of $2,078.70 an ounce in the first week of March. However, it soon lost steam as the Fed announced its first rate hike since 2018 to tame the mounting inflation. Since then, for a major part of 2022, gold prices remained under pressure (even dropped to as low as $1,618 an ounce) due to monetary tightening by central banks around the world. Gold prices have, however, regained ground lately. It crossed the $1,700 an ounce mark in November as the Fed meeting that month signaled a likelihood of a slowdown of rate hikes. Gold rose 7% in November, breaking the seven-month decline stint. So far in December, gold has gained 2% and peaked at $1,836.90 an ounce on Dec 13, following the release of the lower-than-expected U.S. annual inflation figures. Gold has since steadied, closing at $1,787.80 an ounce on Dec 15, as the Fed offered a more hawkish outlook on its policy than markets anticipated. At its last meeting, the Fed delivered a smaller half percentage point rate hike but projected a terminal rate of 5.1% next year, higher than previously stated. While rate hikes pose challenges to gold, continued geopolitical risks and fears of recession will likely drive the demand for gold as a hedge.Story continuesLabor Issues, High Costs Persist: The industry continues to face a shortage of skilled workforce, causing a spike in wages. The industry players are persistently grappling with escalating production costs, including electricity, water and materials, and supply-chain issues. Since the industry cannot control gold prices, it focuses on improving sales volume and operating cash flow, and lowering unit net cash costs. The industry participants are opting for alternate energy sources, such as solar or wind farms, to minimize fuel-price volatility and secure supply. Miners are committed to cost-reduction strategies and digital innovation to drive operating efficiencies.India and China to Support Demand: India and China together account for around 50% of consumer gold demand. A pick-up in demand in China is expected next year, aided by fewer COVID disruptions, a cautious economic rebound and a gradual pick-up in consumer confidence. Retail demand in India is expected to improve on improved consumer confidence and pent-up demand. The demand for physical gold is seasonally higher in the later part of the year, aided by the festival and wedding season in India.Impending Demand and Supply Imbalance to Support Prices: Depleting resources, declining supply in old mines and lack of new mines remain inherent threats to the industry. Due to the scarcity of discoveries and exhaustive existing resources, miners prefer building up reserves through acquisitions rather than digging new ones that are inherently risky and capital-intensive. On the demand side, the use of gold in energy, healthcare and technology is rising. The yellow metal has long been considered a safe-haven investment in times of financial or political uncertainty. So, there will be an eventual demand-supply imbalance that is likely to drive gold prices. This bodes well for the industry in the long haul.Zacks Industry Rank Indicates Bright ProspectsThe group’s Zacks Industry Rank, basically the average of the Zacks Rank of all the member stocks, indicates encouraging near-term prospects. The Zacks Mining - Gold Industry, which is a 39-stock group within the broader Zacks Basic Materials sector, currently carries a Zacks Industry Rank #96, which places it at the top 39% of 248 Zacks industries. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperform the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.Before we present a few stocks that you may want to consider for your portfolio, let’s take a look at the industry’s recent stock-market performance and valuation picture.Industry Outperforms S&amp;P 500 &amp; SectorThe Mining-Gold Industry has outperformed the S&amp;P 500 Index, as well as the Basic Material sector, in a year. The stocks in the industry have collectively gained 5.6% compared with the S&amp;P 500 and the broader sector’s decline of 2.0% and 15.1%, respectively.One-Year Price PerformanceIndustry's Current ValuationOn the basis of the forward 12-month EV/EBITDA, a commonly used multiple for valuing gold-mining companies, we see that the industry is currently trading at 6.86X compared with the S&amp;P 500’s 10.57X and the Basic Material sector’s forward 12-month EV/EBITDA of 6.17X. This is shown in the charts below.Enterprise Value/EBITDA (EV/EBITDA) F12M RatioEnterprise Value/EBITDA (EV/EBITDA) F12M RatioOver the last five years, the industry has traded as high as 9.24X and as low as 4.63X, with the median being 6.30X.4 Mining-Gold Stocks to Keep an Eye onAngloGold Ashanti: The company recently completed the acquisition of Coeur Mining’s (CDE) C-Horst, SNA, Secret Pass and Daisy ore bodies, as well as the decommissioned Sterling Mine in the Beatty district of southern Nevada. The addition of the properties consolidates AU’s ownership position in one of North America’s most promising new gold districts. Gold production for the third quarter of 2022 was up 20% year over year to 738,000 ounces, courtesy of solid performances across the portfolio, bringing the year-to-date total to 1.8 Moz (million ounces). This puts the company on track to meet its production guidance of 2.55-2.80Moz in 2022. The majority of production growth is expected to come from Obuasi, with improvements expected at other assets. The company continues to mitigate the impacts of inflation on its costs through the continued integration of its new operating model (which is aimed at improving operating efficiencies), the operational excellence program already in place, and the Full Asset Potential (FP) program. The FP program aims to achieve a step-change in AngloGold Ashanti’s competitiveness by 2024 and includes a three-month assessment that covers all aspects of the company’s mine sites. The company's shares have gained 43% in the past three months.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company’s, headquartered in Johannesburg, South Africa, 2022 earnings has moved up 13% over the past 60 days. AU has a long-term earnings estimate growth rate of 4%. The company currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).  You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here. Price &amp; Consensus: AUGaliano Gold: The company reported gold production of 43,899 ounces in the third quarter of 2022. Higher production for the quarter was driven by improved metallurgical recoveries and stockpile material performing better than expected. The significant work undertaken in the second quarter of 2022 to optimize the Asanko Gold Mine’s plant performance assisted in the higher recoveries achieved during the period. Backed by the performance, GAU revised its gold production guidance upward to 160,000-170,000 ounces for 2022. Backed by these developments, the company's shares have gained 10.4% in the past three months. GAU concluded the metallurgical test work program at Esaase, which provides greater clarity on the deposit’s metallurgical recoveries. These results, in conjunction with the strong exploration success achieved during the quarter, pave the way to reinstate Mineral Reserves for the Asanko Gold Mine, which will be provided in the upcoming Feasibility Study Technical Report.Headquartered in Vancouver, Canada, Galiano Gold has an expected earnings growth of 133% for the current year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company’s fiscal 2022 earnings has moved up 133% over the past 60 days. GAU currently carries a Zacks Rank #2.Price &amp; Consensus: GAUFranco-Nevada Corporation: FNV appears on a promising long-term trajectory, backed by a healthy portfolio of streaming and royalty agreements on several properties mined by some of the most reputable mining companies in the world. FNV is debt-free and uses its free cash flow to expand the portfolio and pay out dividends. Given its focus on cost management, FNV continues to generate high margins. Franco-Nevada has been enhancing its portfolio without adding significant overhead. The company will gain from mine expansions and the construction of new mines in the years to come. FNV’s shares have appreciated 14.2% in the past three months.This Toronto, Canada-based gold-focused royalty and stream company has a long-term estimated earnings growth rate of 4%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings for fiscal 2022 indicates growth of 4.3% from the year-ago quarter’s reported figure. The consensus estimate has moved up 3.7% over the past 60 days. FNV has a trailing four-quarter earnings surprise of 1.3%, on average. The company currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Price &amp; Consensus: FNVAgnico Eagle Mines: The company increased its exploration budget. It is reinvesting in its assets to expand output. Agnico Eagle Mines’s sufficient cash flow is enabling it to maintain a strong exploration budget, primarily focused on Kittila, Canadian Malartic, LaRonde, Kirkland Lake, Hope Bay and Santa Gertrudis. Notably, the company’s Kittila mine in Finland is the largest primary gold producer in Europe. It also hosts the company's largest mineral reserve. With the expected completion of the shaft sinking expansion at Kittila in 2022, the annual gold production is expected to increase in 2022 and beyond. The company continues to expand the exploration drilling of Roura Main, Sisar and Rimpi Zones to make use of better grades. AEM has identified LaRonde, Canadian Malartic and Nunavut as the major drivers for cash flow generation over the next several years. AEM is expected to gain from the Hope Bay acquisition and the Hammond Reef project. It has access to Meliadine and Canadian Malartic, major contributors to its quarterly production. The company's shares have gained 20.5% in the past three months.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the Toronto, Canada-based company’s 2022 earnings has moved up 3.2% over the past 60 days.

If you want to see more stocks in this selection, check out Jim Cramer's 5 Favorite Dividend Aristocrats. Jim Cramer, the host of Mad Money on CNBC and an anchor on Squawk on the Street, is one of the most followed television personalities commenting on Wall Street equities. At the end of August this year, Cramer put out a list of his 10 favorite “dividend aristocrats” to buy and hold throughout 2022, noting that their dividend payouts provide a safe haven against Federal Reserve policies and consequent market declines. Cramer observed that dividend aristocrats, which are members of the S&amp;P 500 Index with a history of increasing dividends consistently for at least 25 years, have fared better than the broader U.S. stock index. On December 16, Cramer attempted to address the primary investor concern regarding the United States slipping into a recession in the coming year. He told his viewers on Mad Money: “We want the Fed to talk a big game, without needing to actually do too much. Talk is better than action. We want [Fed Chair Jerome Powell] to scare the economy into slowing under its own weight. We don’t want endless rate hikes ... that will destroy everything in its path.”Jim Cramer made these comments in light of the Fed raising interest rates by half a percentage point to their highest levels in 15 years on December 14. The S&amp;P 500 was also down 5.6% in December, continuing its losing streak for weeks. In this market environment, some of the dividend aristocrats favored by Jim Cramer for 2022 include The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO), Caterpillar Inc. (NYSE:CAT), and McDonald's Corporation (NYSE:MCD). Our MethodologyWe explored the 10 dividend aristocrats that Jim Cramer listed as his favorites on an August 30 segment of CNBC’s Mad Money. We have also mentioned the comments he made about these stocks after August 30, to see whether he stands by his original bullish thesis for all these names. We have assessed the hedge fund sentiment from Insider Monkey’s database of 920 elite hedge funds tracked as of the end of the third quarter of 2022. The list is arranged according to the number of hedge fund holders in each firm. Story continuesJim Cramer's Favorite Dividend AristocratsJim Cramer's Favorite Dividend Aristocrats10. Federal Realty Investment Trust (NYSE:FRT)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 24Dividend Yield as of December 16: 4.13%Federal Realty Investment Trust (NYSE:FRT) is a leader in the ownership and operation of high quality retail properties located in primary coastal markets ranging from Washington to Boston, as well as San Francisco and Los Angeles. Federal Realty Investment Trust (NYSE:FRT) aims to distribute long-term, sustainable growth through investing in areas where retail demand outpaces supply. CNBC’s Jim Cramer said in an episode of Mad Money on August 30 that the REIT yields about 4.2% and owns huge suburban retail properties. The reason Federal Realty Investment Trust (NYSE:FRT) featured as one of Cramer’s favorite dividend aristocrats was because the kind of properties it owns and leases remain resilient despite economic weakness. On September 14, Jim Cramer reiterated his support for Federal Realty Investment Trust (NYSE:FRT), saying:“While most retail stocks are horrible right now … the companies that own the best retail real estate are doing just fine.” On November 3, Federal Realty Investment Trust (NYSE:FRT) reported a Q3 FFO of $1.59 and a revenue of $273.45 million, outperforming Wall Street estimates by $0.06 and $12.29 million, respectively. The company raised its full-year 2022 earnings per diluted share guidance to $3.88-$3.93 and increased full-year FFO per diluted share guidance to $6.27 - $6.32 from the prior outlook of $6.10-$6.25 and a $6.21 consensus. According to Insider Monkey’s data, 24 hedge funds reported owning stakes worth $132 million in Federal Realty Investment Trust (NYSE:FRT) at the end of Q3 2022, compared to the same number of funds in the prior quarter worth $200 million. Like The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO), Caterpillar Inc. (NYSE:CAT), and McDonald's Corporation (NYSE:MCD), Federal Realty Investment Trust (NYSE:FRT) is one of the dividend aristocrats backed by Jim Cramer. 9. Realty Income Corporation (NYSE:O)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 28Dividend Yield as of December 16: 4.61%Realty Income Corporation (NYSE:O) is an S&amp;P 500 company that seeks to deliver shareholders with dependable monthly income. It is a California-based company that invests in free-standing, single-tenant commercial properties in the United States, Spain, and the United Kingdom which are subject to NNN Leases. Cramer noted on an August 30 Mad Money segment that:“The stock’s been punished lately because most retail has been struggling.”He observed that Realty Income Corporation (NYSE:O) has “tons of consistent clients” like drugstores, supermarkets, dollar stores, and convenience stores. He further added: “Best of all, Realty Income pays you a monthly dividend that yields 4.3% here.”Supporting Realty Income Corporation (NYSE:O) further, he said on a September 14 segment of Mad Money:“As long as their tenants stay in business, they won’t take much of a hit financially. To me, that looks like an opportunity.”On December 13, Realty Income Corporation (NYSE:O) declared a $0.2485 per share monthly dividend, a 0.2% increase from its prior dividend of $0.248. The dividend is payable on January 13, 2023 to shareholders of record on January 3. The forward yield was 4.60%. The firm has a history of increasing dividend payouts for 28 consecutive years. According to Insider Monkey’s data, Realty Income Corporation (NYSE:O) was part of 28 hedge fund portfolios at the end of Q3 2022, up from 19 in the prior quarter. Stuart J. Zimmer’s Zimmer Partners is the largest position holder in the company, with 2.90 million shares worth $169 million. 8. Hormel Foods Corporation (NYSE:HRL)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 29Dividend Yield as of December 16: 2.41%Hormel Foods Corporation (NYSE:HRL) was founded in 1891 and is headquartered in Austin, Minnesota. The company develops, processes, and distributes meat, nuts, and food products to retail, foodservice, deli, and commercial customers in the United States and internationally. The company operates through four segments – Grocery Products, Refrigerated Foods, Jennie-O Turkey Store, and International &amp; Other. Jim Cramer said on his Mad Money segment on August 30 that Hormel Foods Corporation (NYSE:HRL) is a classic defensive name, noting that as inflation crushed consumers, Hormel could be “a good trade-down play.”On December 1, Cramer was in conversation with Hormel Foods Corporation (NYSE:HRL)’s CEO, discussing the company's negative Q4 organic volume growth and the recent dividend increase. The CEO reassured Cramer that the company is dedicated to protecting and increasing its dividend payouts, which may not look huge, but it has consistently increased payouts for the last 57 years. Hormel also has a fortress balance sheet and the negative growth is easily compensated by the strong cash position and dividend growth. Hormel Foods Corporation (NYSE:HRL) still remains one of Cramer’s favorite dividend aristocrats. Hormel Foods Corporation (NYSE:HRL) on November 21 declared a quarterly dividend of $0.275 per share, a 5.8% increase from its prior dividend of $0.26. The dividend is distributable on February 15, 2023 to shareholders of record on January 17. According to Insider Monkey’s data, 29 funds reported owning stakes worth $455.8 million in Hormel Foods Corporation (NYSE:HRL) at the end of September 2022, compared to 27 funds in the earlier quarter worth $434.5 million. Jim Simons’ Renaissance Technologies is the leading position holder in the company, with 2.3 million shares worth $106.3 million. Here is what LRT Capital Management has to say about Hormel Foods Corporation (NYSE:HRL) in its Q3 2021 investor letter:“Hormel Foods Corporation (HRL) – the maker of SPAM and Applegate Turkey (among many other products), is down over 20% since peaking last year, largely on fears of higher cost. We expect the company will be able to raise prices to offset cost inflation as they have always been able to win their past.”7. General Dynamics Corporation (NYSE:GD)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 35Dividend Yield as of December 16: 2.06%General Dynamics Corporation (NYSE:GD) was founded in 1899 and is headquartered in Reston, Virginia. It operates as an aerospace and defense company worldwide, and it has four segments – Aerospace, Marine Systems, Combat Systems, and Technologies. On Mad Money’s August-end segment, Jim Cramer said that he is optimistic about the defense industry overall, but General Dynamics Corporation (NYSE:GD) is the only dividend aristocrat in the sector. He told viewers: “Unfortunately, they also have a business jet division that will no doubt get hit if we have a nasty recession, but that hasn’t stopped the stock from rallying 11% this year, aided by a very hands-on management that knows what’s needed in a less secure world.”Cramer also backed General Dynamics Corporation (NYSE:GD) in a May 2020 segment of Mad Money, saying: “You have to take a long view on GD ’cause it’s not the favorite one right now. It’s not the loved one and the whole group is a little under pressure, but I think General Dynamics is a very good long-term hold.”On December 7, General Dynamics Corporation (NYSE:GD) declared a $1.26 per share quarterly dividend, in line with previous. The dividend is payable on February 10, 2023 to shareholders of record on January 20. The quarterly dividend was increased by 6% in 2022 to stretch General Dynamics’ dividend hike streak to 26 years. According to Insider Monkey’s data, General Dynamics Corporation (NYSE:GD) was part of 35 hedge fund portfolios at the end of September 2022, compared to 42 in the prior quarter. James A. Star’s Longview Asset Management is the leading position holder in the company, with 30 million shares worth $6.4 billion. Here is what Oakmark Global Fund has to say about General Dynamics Corporation (NYSE:GD) in their Q1 2021 investor letter:“The second new U.S. equity purchase was General Dynamics, a leading U.S. defense contractor and owner of the world’s premier business jet franchise (Gulfstream). We were able to purchase this high-quality and durable business at a meaningful discount to our estimate of its intrinsic value after a series of near-term concerns hurt its share price. Taking a longer term view, the company’s business jet franchise should benefit from a multi-year investment program in new, differentiated products. Also, its free cash flow conversion is set to improve materially and the company is poised to benefit from a highly visible ramp up in revenue related to next generation nuclear-powered submarines. As these positives come into clearer view, we expect sentiment to improve, along with the company’s share price.”6. Archer-Daniels-Midland Company (NYSE:ADM)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 37Dividend Yield as of December 16: 1.73%Archer-Daniels-Midland Company (NYSE:ADM) procures, transports, processes, and merchandises agricultural commodities in the United States, Switzerland, Cayman Islands, Brazil, Mexico, the United Kingdom, and internationally. The company operates through three segments – Ag Services and Oilseeds, Carbohydrate Solutions, and Nutrition. Jim Cramer told viewers on August 30 that he likes Archer-Daniels-Midland Company (NYSE:ADM) and the potential upside from supply chain disruptions. He also said that the stock has started to rebound from its mid-July bottom, driven by a recovery in crop prices. He called it a “conservative, decent stock.”Jim Cramer reinforced his prior Archer-Daniels-Midland Company (NYSE:ADM) thesis on a December 14 segment of Mad Money, saying that the stock is the best performer in consumer staples space so far this year, and is a winner as long as the Russia-Ukraine war continues. He categorized it as one of the top five consumer staple stocks for 2023.According to Insider Monkey’s Q3 data, 37 hedge funds were long Archer-Daniels-Midland Company (NYSE:ADM), compared to 42 funds in the earlier quarter. Tom Gayner’s Markel Gayner Asset Management is the leading position holder in the company, with nearly 1.5 million shares worth $117.7 million. In addition to The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO), Caterpillar Inc. (NYSE:CAT), and McDonald's Corporation (NYSE:MCD), Archer-Daniels-Midland Company (NYSE:ADM) is one of the favorite dividend aristocrats of Jim Cramer. Here is what Diamond Hill Long-Short Fund has to say about Archer-Daniels-Midland Company (NYSE:ADM) in its Q1 2022 investor letter:“ADM is a leading agricultural processor that also operates a global nutrition business focused on the development of ingredients and flavors for food and beverages, supplements and more. The company’s recent operating results have benefited (unfortunately) from the war in Ukraine as grain prices and agricultural markets globally experienced strong price increases. ADM is positioned well to benefit from the volatility due to its stable North American agricultural base.” Click to continue reading and see Jim Cramer's 5 Favorite Dividend Aristocrats.  Suggested articles:15 Biggest Endowments in the US10 Best Tobacco Stocks To Buy12 Dividend Stocks That Outperform S&amp;P 500 Disclosure: None.

(NYSE:ZTS) stock at an average sell price of US$162 during the past year. After the stock price dropped 5.8% last week, the company's market value declined by US$4.2b, but insiders were able to mitigate their losses.While we would never suggest that investors should base their decisions solely on what the directors of a company have been doing, logic dictates you should pay some attention to whether insiders are buying or selling shares. Check out our latest analysis for Zoetis Zoetis Insider Transactions Over The Last YearThe Independent Director, Willie Reed, made the biggest insider sale in the last 12 months. That single transaction was for US$301k worth of shares at a price of US$162 each. We generally don't like to see insider selling, but the lower the sale price, the more it concerns us. The silver lining is that this sell-down took place above the latest price (US$144). So it may not tell us anything about how insiders feel about the current share price.

(NYSE:NRG) shareholders may wish to note that the President, Mauricio Gutierrez, recently bought US$480k worth of stock, paying US$32.03 for each share. Although the purchase only increased their holding by 1.4%, it is still a solid purchase in our view. See our latest analysis for NRG Energy NRG Energy Insider Transactions Over The Last YearIn fact, the recent purchase by Mauricio Gutierrez was the biggest purchase of NRG Energy shares made by an insider individual in the last twelve months, according to our records. So it's clear an insider wanted to buy, even at a higher price than the current share price (being US$31.05). Their view may have changed since then, but at least it shows they felt optimistic at the time. In our view, the price an insider pays for shares is very important. As a general rule, we feel more positive about a stock if insiders have bought shares at above current prices, because that suggests they viewed the stock as good value, even at a higher price.While NRG Energy insiders bought shares during the last year, they didn't sell.

Most former leaders have been jailed or investigated for corruption.The situation has exploded in the last two weeks. Protesters have blocked highways, set buildings on fire and taken over airports in the wake of Castillo's Dec. 7 ouster, hours after he illegally tried to shutter Congress to avoid an impeachment vote he feared losing. At least 18 people have died.Many of the protesters - some Castillo supporters and others simply angry - said they felt ignored by political leaders. Castillo, a former teacher and son of peasant farmers, had at least been one of their own, they said, despite his many flaws.""Nobody represents me now,"" said Huamani, who blames Congress and new president Dina Boluarte, Castillo's former vice president, for the protest deaths. Many like him carry banners calling her a ""murderer"" and demanding she resign.The police and armed forces have been accused by rights groups of using deadly firearms and dropping smoke bombs from helicopters. The military says protesters, most in Peru's Andean south, have used homemade weapons and explosives.Boluarte, Peru's first female president and who can speak Andean indigenous language Quechua, has called for calm and implored Congress to bring forward elections. She has said she will not resign, despite the pressures.Story continues""She only represents the dead,"" Huamani added. ""We elected a humble rural teacher like us, hoping for a revolution that would bring the poor into power.""'NEST OF RATS'Castillo rose unexpectedly to the presidency last year on a wave of support from rural voters fed up with the status quo and what they saw as a corrupt Lima-based political elite.""I was chosen by the forgotten men and women of deep Peru, by the dispossessed who have been neglected for over 200 years,"" Castillo said in a handwritten letter from jail. He is serving 18 months of pretrial detention while being investigated for alleged crimes of rebellion and conspiracy, which he denies.He thanked his supporters for coming out on to the streets and accused the military and police of conducting what he called ""massacres"".""In this difficult context, the coup mongers, exploiting and starving us, today they want to silence my people,"" he wrote.A political rookie, he had won support with pledges to reform the constitution, redistribute huge copper riches and empower marginalized indigenous groups. On many of these promises he failed, his star waning before his ouster. He and his associates faced a spate of corruption probes and he went through five Cabinets and over 80 ministers in just 17 months.But his arrest has erased some of the disappointment. Hundreds of people from Peru's Amazonian jungle, mountain and rural regions have flocked to Lima in his support, including to the jail where he is being held.""The Peruvian people will rise and defend the popular vote,"" supporter Merina Chavez told Reuters outside the prison, aiming her ire at lawmakers. ""Congress did not let him do his job.""Castillo, who ran for the socialist Peru Libre party but later shifted towards the right, faced a hostile and fragmented legislature, where the conservative party of the candidate he narrowly defeated held the largest single bloc.He was impeached three times, the final time being voted out of office by a large majority after his attempt to dissolve Congress sparked resignations by ministers and accusations of a coup by former allies and constitutional officials.Most Peruvians, however, still blame the country's political woes on Congress. Seen as corrupt and self-serving, the parliament has an approval rating of only 11%, according to pollster Datum. Castillo's had been 24% before his removal.In a recent poll some 44% of Peruvians said they supported Castillo's attempt to dissolve the legislature, even though he tried to do it outside constitutional bounds.Outside the Lima jail, Katherine Asto had come to support Castillo wearing a white hat with a slogan making her feelings clear: ""Shut down Congress, it's a nest of rats"".(Reporting by Marco Aquino, Alexander Villegas and Liamar Ramos Writing by Adam Jourdan Editing by Daniel Wallis and Frances Kerry)]"

Aerojet's solid fuel rocket motors and other propulsion systems would help L3Harris expand its space defense systems and precision munitions businesses.L3Harris outbid General Electric Co in the final stages of a sale process for Aerojet with a $58-per-share offer, one of the sources said. An agreement could be announced as early as Monday, the sources added.The sources requested anonymity because the matter is confidential. Spokespeople for Aerojet, L3Harris and General Electric did not immediately respond to requests for comment.The deal represents a 28% premium to Aerojet's share price on Oct. 24., the last trading day before Reuters reported that the company was exploring a sale.Aerojet is the biggest maker of propulsion systems in the U.S. defense industry left as an independent company after Northrop Grumman Corp acquired Orbital ATK Inc in 2018 for $9.2 billion.The company develops and manufactures liquid and solid fuel rocket motors and hypersonic engines for space, defense, civil and commercial applications. Its customers include the Pentagon, Boeing, Lockheed Martin and Raytheon Technologies Corp.L3Harris is itself the product of industry consolidation, created in 2019 through the merger of L3 Technologies and Harris Corp, which were looking for scale as they sought to become bigger Pentagon suppliers. The company has since been growing through acquisitions, most recently with a deal in October to buy Viasat Inc's tactical data business for $1.96 billion.Jefferies analysts wrote in a note earlier this month after Reuters reported that L3 Harris was one of the bidders vying for Aerojet that the latter offered complementary programs across key growth areas that would account for 15% of L3Harris' sales. ""Overlap is more complementary than vertical, limiting regulatory risk,"" the Jefferies analysts wrote.(Reporting by David Carnevali in New York and Mike Stone in Washington, D.C.; Editing by Chizu Nomiyama)]"

For more countries, head on over to 5 Most Advanced Countries in Military Technology. Military technology, or the use of technology for the brutal art of warfare, is one of the oldest domains in human history. From the caveman using a simple spear to today's high end stealth fighter jets and drones, this field has continuously evolved and is a primary contributor to the ability of armed forces to see the tide of war turn in their favor.In terms of monetary value, defense items are among the most expensive in the world. The U.S.' crown jewel fighter jet, the F-22 Raptor, costs the USAF a cool $120 million to purchase exclusive of development costs and more than $68,000 (higher than the average U.S. income) to operate per hour. The industry itself stood at $474 billion last year and will grow to $513 billion this year with a compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) of 8.2%. Top American firms, which are also the leading players globally, which manufacturer hypersonics, fighter aircraft, and atom bombs are Lockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE:LMT), Northrop Grumman Corporation (NYSE:NOC), Aerojet Rocketdyne Holdings, Inc. (NYSE:AJRD), and The Boeing Company (NYSE:BA).Out of these, Lockheed is the most versatile, as it is involved in making hypersonic vehicles, nuclear weapons, and the leading fighter aircraft in the world. Its F-22 Raptor is the world's oldest fighter jet. However, Northrop is known for its bombers and drones, and its latest B-21 Raider bomber revealed in December 2022 is a sight to behold.Photo by Joel Rivera-Camacho on UnsplashOur Methodology We studied a wide variety of factors to determine the world's most technologically advanced countries. However, to rank the countries, we have first listed down today's great power nations that are able to project military power globally. The data for military aircraft strength from Global Firepower is used for added context, and middle power nations are used to complete the list.Story continues15 Most Advanced Countries in Military Technology15. State of Israel Total Military Aircraft Fleet Strength as of 2022: 597 The State of Israel has a gross domestic product of $496 billion and a high GDP per capita of $52,173. The Israeli Air Force has fought some of the highest number of wars in its history, and the country is a defense partner of the United States. While its air force relies on American aircraft, Israel uses its own variants of modern aircraft such as the F-16, which is called the F-16I Soufa.14. Hellenic Republic Total Military Aircraft Fleet Strength as of 2022: 633The Hellenic Republic, also known as Greece, is a European country that is commonly referred to as the cradle of Western civilization due to having produced philosophers such as Socrates, Plato, and Aristotle. Its air force relies primarily on the U.S. F-16 Fighting Falcon aircraft, and Greece has produced some of the best fighter pilots in the world which dominate exercises such as the Red Flag and are often voted as the best in NATO. Additionally, Greek F-16s are among the latest in the world, as they belong to the Block 72 category. These jets are often dubbed as 4.5 generation due to modern capabilities such as AESA radars.13. Federative Republic of Brazil Total Military Aircraft Fleet Strength as of 2022: 679 The Federative Republic of Brazil is the largest country in North and South America, and an emerging power with a $3.6 trillion gross domestic product (GDP). The Brazilian Air Force is the second largest air force in the Americas after the U.S. Brazil's aerospace sector is one of the strongest in the world, and the air force relies mostly on aircraft that are produced either entirely or partially in Brazil. These are among the most advanced aircraft in the world, such as the JAS 39 Gripen.12. Taiwan Total Military Aircraft Fleet Strength as of 2022: 741 Taiwan is an Asian island region that plays a central role in the global supply of semiconductors, which are chips that are used in both military systems and consumer products. Taiwan has a total of 741 military aircraft in operation, with roughly half belonging to its air force. Its backbone fighter is the U.S. F-16 Fighting Falcon, but Taiwan's own AIDC F-CK-1 Ching-Kuo stands beside the F-16 as being the air force's primary line of defense. The AIDC F-CK-1 Ching-Kuo can travel as fast as Mach 1.8 with a 1,100 kilometer range, and it was initially designed to carry nuclear weapons. A possible action by China against Taiwan can cause a massive escalation in the region, which would bring profits for companies like Lockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE:LMT), Northrop Grumman Corporation (NYSE:NOC), Aerojet Rocketdyne Holdings, Inc. (NYSE:AJRD), and The Boeing Company (NYSE:BA).11. Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA) Total Military Aircraft Fleet Strength as of 2022: 897The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA), or simply Saudi Arabia, is the world's leading oil exporter. It also has one of the largest air forces in the world, which relies on the American F-15 Eagle aircraft for force projection. The F-15 is one of the most powerful aircraft right now, since it is a dual engine design that gives it a longer range and faster speed. Saudi Arabia has the third largest F-15 fleet in the world, after the U.S. and Japan, and the primary variant used by the Saudis is the F-15 strike fighter - which allows for both air superiority and strike attacks. As security anxieties of Saudi Arabia build up, it is increasing its military spending, which benefits major players like Lockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE:LMT), Northrop Grumman Corporation (NYSE:NOC), Aerojet Rocketdyne Holdings, Inc. (NYSE:AJRD), and The Boeing Company (NYSE:BA).10. Republic of India Total Military Aircraft Fleet Strength as of 2022: 2,182 The Republic of India is one of the largest countries in the world in terms of both population and economy. It is the most populous after China and has an economy that is worth $11.6 trillion - the third largest in the world. India operates fighter aircraft, ballistic missiles, cruise missiles, and even an aircraft carrier. However, most of its equipment is imported, and the country is yet to indigenously develop a modern fighter jet.9. Italian Republic Total Military Aircraft Fleet Strength as of 2022: 862 The Italian Republic is a European country that is also one of the richest in the world with a gross domestic product (GDP) of $3 trillion. Italy operates a total of 862 military aircraft, of which roughly half belong to its air force. The Italian Air Force, or the Aeronautica Militare, relies primarily on Britain's Eurofighter Typhoon as its backbone fighter. The Typhoon is one of the few variable swept wing aircraft in the world, which lets its change its wing shape while in the air to suit the mission profile. Italy is also a partner of the U.S. F-35 program, with the F-35 being one of the few 5th generation aircraft in the world. Italy also develops and manufactures the Panavia Tornado aircraft, in partnership with the U.K. and Germany.8. Republic of Türkiye Total Military Aircraft Fleet Strength as of 2022: 1,057The Republic of Türkiye, or Turkey, has one of the strongest military defense complexes in the world. It is one of the few countries in the world that is licensed in the world to manufacture the F-16, showcasing its technological strength. Turkey manufactures air platforms, naval platforms, artillery, signals equipment, software, sensors, and other defense products. Additionally, it also has the capability to manufacture F-35 components.7. Japan Total Military Aircraft Fleet Strength as of 2022: 1,449Japan is an Asian country that is a leading player in global affairs and a global power. It has a historic defense industry, which enabled it to operate aircraft carriers during World War 2. Japan has rapidly focused on military technology for exports since it lifted its arms exports ban in 2018. The country manufactures the Mitsubishi F-2 fighter jet, which is derived from the F-16, and Japan has also successfully manufactured and operated the F15-J fighter aircraft - an F-15 variant.6. French Republic Total Military Aircraft Fleet Strength as of 2022: 1,055 The French Republic is a European nation with a permanent seat on the United Nations Security Council. France is one of the leading defense exporters globally, with both its submarines and its fighter jets renowned for their performance advantages. France's Dassault Rafale aircraft is among the most advanced in the industry, and France is one of the few countries in the world that can manufacture jet aircraft engines. The Russian invasion of Ukraine has forced European countries like France to increase their military spending and they are expected to increase their orders for companies like Lockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE:LMT), Northrop Grumman Corporation (NYSE:NOC), Aerojet Rocketdyne Holdings, Inc. (NYSE:AJRD), and The Boeing Company (NYSE:BA).Click to continue reading and see 5 Most Advanced Countries in Military Technology.  Suggested Articles:10 Best Performing Country ETFs in 202215 Countries That Produce the Most OilMost Advanced Countries in Artificial IntelligenceDisclosure: None. 15 Most Advanced Countries in Military Technology is originally published on Insider Monkey.]"

You can skip our detailed analysis of the relationship between crime and economic growth around the world and go directly to 5 Most Dangerous Countries in the World in 2022. Crime, Instability and EconomyResearch from Auburn University shows that for an increase of 10% in crime in a country with a mean population of 25 million, it loses $225 million (adjusted for inflation in 2022) in revenue from tourism annually. Moreover, the EGADE Business School of Mexico studied the effects of crime on the inflow of Direct Foreign Investment (DFI) in the country from 2005-2015 and found that homicides and robberies had a statistically-significant negative effect on DFI-inflows during the period. For every 1% increase in homicides, there was a decrease of 0.28% in foreign investment. Robberies had a bigger effect, with 0.33% loss in DFI for every 1% increase in robberies. As far as political instability goes, it has been shown to be positively correlated with crime and most likely has a multiplying effect on the latter. The US, as the dominant military and economic power in the world, has intervened in several countries to prevent political instability. It is able to enforce the rules-based order owing to its military superiority, thanks to defense-technology companies like Lockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE:LMT), Northrop Grumman Corporation (NYSE:NOC) and Raytheon Technologies Corporation (NYSE:RTX).Mitigating StrategiesWe’ve focused on crime in this section since political instability does not have a one-size-fits-all solution. Even in crime, the best bet is to prevent it practically in the most efficient way possible until there’s a unified criminal theory that captures all its nuance. In this respect, the concept of smart cities shows promise. It comprises three layers: technology like smartphones and communication networks like the internet, digital applications that mine insights from big-data, and city-wide implementation frameworks. Story continuesIn terms of crimes in mega cities that are economically important and hard to manage, incidents like robberies, car-theft and burglary could be reduced by 30-40% while response time could be cut by 20-35% using smart city concepts with statistical crime-hot-area flagging and data-driven policing etc. This should of course be done in a manner that does not reinforce stereotypes and endanger certain minorities, compromise people’s liberties or reduce human dignity to data and AI. Photo by Peter Scherbatykh on UnsplashOur MethodologyFor our list of the 25 most dangerous countries in the world in 2022, we’ve defined a dangerous country as one with a high crime rate, high levels of political instability and general violence. For this purpose, we’ve used data from the Global Peace Index (GPI) 2022 by the Economics and Peace Organization.The Global Peace Index measures the danger in countries on a scale of 1 to 5, with higher scores relating to higher danger. It accounts for factors like political instability, violent crime rate, external conflict, intensity of internal conflict and terrorism etc. However, as it additionally also accounts for factors that are irrelevant insofar as danger goes, we’ve used data from sources like The World Bank and Insight Crime as well.25. KenyaGPI Score: 2.30Kenya is dangerous enough for the State Department to warn the US citizens to exercise caution when traveling to the country due to terrorist incidents and violent crime in areas of Turkana and the Kenya-Somalia border. 24. Mozambique GPI Score: 2.31Mozambique is the 24th most dangerous country in the world.

SudanGPI Score: 3Sudan is located in Southeast Africa and happens to be one of the most dangerous countries in the world in 2022.

If you want to see more best cheap stocks to buy now for long term, go directly to 5 Best Cheap Stocks to Buy Now for Long Term.To many investors, a cheap stock isn't a stock that's trading for a low stock price.Instead, a cheap stock is a stock of a company that is trading for considerably below its intrinsic value. A company's intrinsic value is what the company is really worth.Although there are exceptions, the intrinsic value of high quality companies with competitive advantages tend to go up in the long term as those companies grow their market share or launch new products or services. The earnings per share of those companies can go higher as those companies buy back their stock. Those high quality companies can also pay a dividend as a way to return capital back to shareholders.In the long term, quality stocks with competitive advantages tend to outperform stocks that might trade for lower valuations but don't have the same quality businesses.In the near term, however, some quality stocks might trade for lower valuations than they should given the market headwinds this year.2022In terms of 2022, there have been a lot of market headwinds for stocks given the Federal Reserve has raised interest rates seven times this year. As a result of the interest rate increases, the Federal Reserve's federal funds rate is now 4.25% to 4.5% and the U.S. central bank might not be done with the raises.According to projections released from the Federal Reserve during a December two day policy meeting, the U.S. central bank will raise interest rates past 5% next year.Given the interest rate increases, borrowing costs have increased and it is harder for some businesses to make money. With the higher rates, some businesses have seen softer demand and the overall valuation of the broader market has decreased as capital has moved from the equities market into Treasuries. With the higher interest rates, many economists think there could be a recession next year.Story continuesWith the lower overall market, the stocks of some high quality businesses are arguably fairly cheap given their future potential in the long term.Given the uncertainty, however, it could be a good idea for long term investors to own a well diversified portfolio of stocks across many different sectors.Pixabay/Public DomainMethodologyFor our list of 10 Best Cheap Stocks to Buy Now for Long Term, we picked 10 stocks with competitive advantages that arguably trade below their intrinsic value in the long term.We then ranked the 10 stocks based on the number of hedge funds in our database that held shares of the same stock at the end of Q3.For those of you interested, check out 12 Cheap Stocks to Buy That Outperformed in 2022.10 Best Cheap Stocks to Buy Now for Long Term10.

(NYSE:CCI) still benefits from 5G development in the U.S which could increase demand for the company's communications infrastructure in the long term.If demand remains strong, Crown Castle International Corp.

Given the increases, Wal-Mart continued to gain market share in the grocery sector, giving it even more scale to support its everyday low prices.In the third quarter, Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT) approved a new $20 billion share repurchase authorization to replace its existing authorization which had $1.9 billion remaining at the end of September.

As one of the ‘Big Four’ U.S. banks it enjoys scale driven cost advantages and economies of scale which provide meaningful competitive advantages and potential for strong returns in the largely commoditized banking industry.

As a large-cap stock with high coverage by analysts, you could assume any recent changes in the company’s outlook is already priced into the stock. But what if there is still an opportunity to buy? Let’s take a look at Boeing’s outlook and value based on the most recent financial data to see if the opportunity still exists. Check out our latest analysis for Boeing Is Boeing Still Cheap?Good news, investors! Boeing is still a bargain right now. My valuation model shows that the intrinsic value for the stock is $256.76, which is above what the market is valuing the company at the moment. This indicates a potential opportunity to buy low. Although, there may be another chance to buy again in the future. This is because Boeing’s beta (a measure of share price volatility) is high, meaning its price movements will be exaggerated relative to the rest of the market. If the market is bearish, the company's shares will likely fall by more than the rest of the market, providing a prime buying opportunity.Can we expect growth from Boeing?earnings-and-revenue-growthInvestors looking for growth in their portfolio may want to consider the prospects of a company before buying its shares. Buying a great company with a robust outlook at a cheap price is always a good investment, so let’s also take a look at the company's future expectations. With revenues expected to grow by 60% over the next couple of years, the future seems bright for Boeing. If the level of expenses is able to be maintained, it looks like higher cash flow is on the cards for the stock, which should feed into a higher share valuation.What This Means For YouAre you a shareholder? Since BA is currently undervalued, it may be a great time to increase your holdings in the stock. With an optimistic outlook on the horizon, it seems like this growth has not yet been fully factored into the share price. However, there are also other factors such as capital structure to consider, which could explain the current undervaluation.Story continuesAre you a potential investor? If you’ve been keeping an eye on BA for a while, now might be the time to enter the stock. Its buoyant future outlook isn’t fully reflected in the current share price yet, which means it’s not too late to buy BA. But before you make any investment decisions, consider other factors such as the track record of its management team, in order to make a well-informed investment decision.If you want to dive deeper into Boeing, you'd also look into what risks it is currently facing.

For more countries, head on over to 5 Most Advanced Countries in Military Technology. Military technology, or the use of technology for the brutal art of warfare, is one of the oldest domains in human history. From the caveman using a simple spear to today's high end stealth fighter jets and drones, this field has continuously evolved and is a primary contributor to the ability of armed forces to see the tide of war turn in their favor.In terms of monetary value, defense items are among the most expensive in the world. The U.S.' crown jewel fighter jet, the F-22 Raptor, costs the USAF a cool $120 million to purchase exclusive of development costs and more than $68,000 (higher than the average U.S. income) to operate per hour. The industry itself stood at $474 billion last year and will grow to $513 billion this year with a compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) of 8.2%. Top American firms, which are also the leading players globally, which manufacturer hypersonics, fighter aircraft, and atom bombs are Lockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE:LMT), Northrop Grumman Corporation (NYSE:NOC), Aerojet Rocketdyne Holdings, Inc. (NYSE:AJRD), and The Boeing Company (NYSE:BA).Out of these, Lockheed is the most versatile, as it is involved in making hypersonic vehicles, nuclear weapons, and the leading fighter aircraft in the world. Its F-22 Raptor is the world's oldest fighter jet. However, Northrop is known for its bombers and drones, and its latest B-21 Raider bomber revealed in December 2022 is a sight to behold.Photo by Joel Rivera-Camacho on UnsplashOur Methodology We studied a wide variety of factors to determine the world's most technologically advanced countries. However, to rank the countries, we have first listed down today's great power nations that are able to project military power globally. The data for military aircraft strength from Global Firepower is used for added context, and middle power nations are used to complete the list.Story continues15 Most Advanced Countries in Military Technology15. State of Israel Total Military Aircraft Fleet Strength as of 2022: 597 The State of Israel has a gross domestic product of $496 billion and a high GDP per capita of $52,173. The Israeli Air Force has fought some of the highest number of wars in its history, and the country is a defense partner of the United States. While its air force relies on American aircraft, Israel uses its own variants of modern aircraft such as the F-16, which is called the F-16I Soufa.14. Hellenic Republic Total Military Aircraft Fleet Strength as of 2022: 633The Hellenic Republic, also known as Greece, is a European country that is commonly referred to as the cradle of Western civilization due to having produced philosophers such as Socrates, Plato, and Aristotle. Its air force relies primarily on the U.S. F-16 Fighting Falcon aircraft, and Greece has produced some of the best fighter pilots in the world which dominate exercises such as the Red Flag and are often voted as the best in NATO. Additionally, Greek F-16s are among the latest in the world, as they belong to the Block 72 category. These jets are often dubbed as 4.5 generation due to modern capabilities such as AESA radars.13. Federative Republic of Brazil Total Military Aircraft Fleet Strength as of 2022: 679 The Federative Republic of Brazil is the largest country in North and South America, and an emerging power with a $3.6 trillion gross domestic product (GDP). The Brazilian Air Force is the second largest air force in the Americas after the U.S. Brazil's aerospace sector is one of the strongest in the world, and the air force relies mostly on aircraft that are produced either entirely or partially in Brazil. These are among the most advanced aircraft in the world, such as the JAS 39 Gripen.12. Taiwan Total Military Aircraft Fleet Strength as of 2022: 741 Taiwan is an Asian island region that plays a central role in the global supply of semiconductors, which are chips that are used in both military systems and consumer products. Taiwan has a total of 741 military aircraft in operation, with roughly half belonging to its air force. Its backbone fighter is the U.S. F-16 Fighting Falcon, but Taiwan's own AIDC F-CK-1 Ching-Kuo stands beside the F-16 as being the air force's primary line of defense. The AIDC F-CK-1 Ching-Kuo can travel as fast as Mach 1.8 with a 1,100 kilometer range, and it was initially designed to carry nuclear weapons. A possible action by China against Taiwan can cause a massive escalation in the region, which would bring profits for companies like Lockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE:LMT), Northrop Grumman Corporation (NYSE:NOC), Aerojet Rocketdyne Holdings, Inc. (NYSE:AJRD), and The Boeing Company (NYSE:BA).11. Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA) Total Military Aircraft Fleet Strength as of 2022: 897The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA), or simply Saudi Arabia, is the world's leading oil exporter. It also has one of the largest air forces in the world, which relies on the American F-15 Eagle aircraft for force projection. The F-15 is one of the most powerful aircraft right now, since it is a dual engine design that gives it a longer range and faster speed. Saudi Arabia has the third largest F-15 fleet in the world, after the U.S. and Japan, and the primary variant used by the Saudis is the F-15 strike fighter - which allows for both air superiority and strike attacks. As security anxieties of Saudi Arabia build up, it is increasing its military spending, which benefits major players like Lockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE:LMT), Northrop Grumman Corporation (NYSE:NOC), Aerojet Rocketdyne Holdings, Inc. (NYSE:AJRD), and The Boeing Company (NYSE:BA).10. Republic of India Total Military Aircraft Fleet Strength as of 2022: 2,182 The Republic of India is one of the largest countries in the world in terms of both population and economy. It is the most populous after China and has an economy that is worth $11.6 trillion - the third largest in the world. India operates fighter aircraft, ballistic missiles, cruise missiles, and even an aircraft carrier. However, most of its equipment is imported, and the country is yet to indigenously develop a modern fighter jet.9. Italian Republic Total Military Aircraft Fleet Strength as of 2022: 862 The Italian Republic is a European country that is also one of the richest in the world with a gross domestic product (GDP) of $3 trillion. Italy operates a total of 862 military aircraft, of which roughly half belong to its air force. The Italian Air Force, or the Aeronautica Militare, relies primarily on Britain's Eurofighter Typhoon as its backbone fighter. The Typhoon is one of the few variable swept wing aircraft in the world, which lets its change its wing shape while in the air to suit the mission profile. Italy is also a partner of the U.S. F-35 program, with the F-35 being one of the few 5th generation aircraft in the world. Italy also develops and manufactures the Panavia Tornado aircraft, in partnership with the U.K. and Germany.8. Republic of Türkiye Total Military Aircraft Fleet Strength as of 2022: 1,057The Republic of Türkiye, or Turkey, has one of the strongest military defense complexes in the world. It is one of the few countries in the world that is licensed in the world to manufacture the F-16, showcasing its technological strength. Turkey manufactures air platforms, naval platforms, artillery, signals equipment, software, sensors, and other defense products. Additionally, it also has the capability to manufacture F-35 components.7. Japan Total Military Aircraft Fleet Strength as of 2022: 1,449Japan is an Asian country that is a leading player in global affairs and a global power. It has a historic defense industry, which enabled it to operate aircraft carriers during World War 2. Japan has rapidly focused on military technology for exports since it lifted its arms exports ban in 2018. The country manufactures the Mitsubishi F-2 fighter jet, which is derived from the F-16, and Japan has also successfully manufactured and operated the F15-J fighter aircraft - an F-15 variant.6. French Republic Total Military Aircraft Fleet Strength as of 2022: 1,055 The French Republic is a European nation with a permanent seat on the United Nations Security Council. France is one of the leading defense exporters globally, with both its submarines and its fighter jets renowned for their performance advantages. France's Dassault Rafale aircraft is among the most advanced in the industry, and France is one of the few countries in the world that can manufacture jet aircraft engines. The Russian invasion of Ukraine has forced European countries like France to increase their military spending and they are expected to increase their orders for companies like Lockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE:LMT), Northrop Grumman Corporation (NYSE:NOC), Aerojet Rocketdyne Holdings, Inc. (NYSE:AJRD), and The Boeing Company (NYSE:BA).Click to continue reading and see 5 Most Advanced Countries in Military Technology.  Suggested Articles:10 Best Performing Country ETFs in 202215 Countries That Produce the Most OilMost Advanced Countries in Artificial IntelligenceDisclosure: None. 15 Most Advanced Countries in Military Technology is originally published on Insider Monkey.]"

This article is for those who would like to learn about Return On Equity (ROE). By way of learning-by-doing, we'll look at ROE to gain a better understanding of The Southern Company (NYSE:SO).ROE or return on equity is a useful tool to assess how effectively a company can generate returns on the investment it received from its shareholders. Put another way, it reveals the company's success at turning shareholder investments into profits. View our latest analysis for Southern How Do You Calculate Return On Equity?Return on equity can be calculated by using the formula:Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' EquitySo, based on the above formula, the ROE for Southern is:9.2% = US$3.3b ÷ US$36b (Based on the trailing twelve months to September 2022).The 'return' is the income the business earned over the last year. Another way to think of that is that for every $1 worth of equity, the company was able to earn $0.09 in profit.Does Southern Have A Good ROE?Arguably the easiest way to assess company's ROE is to compare it with the average in its industry. Importantly, this is far from a perfect measure, because companies differ significantly within the same industry classification. You can see in the graphic below that Southern has an ROE that is fairly close to the average for the Electric Utilities industry (9.1%).roeThat's neither particularly good, nor bad. While at least the ROE is not lower than the industry, its still worth checking what role the company's debt plays as high debt levels relative to equity may also make the ROE appear high. If true, then it is more an indication of risk than the potential. To know the 4 risks we have identified for Southern visit our risks dashboard for free.How Does Debt Impact ROE?Most companies need money -- from somewhere -- to grow their profits. That cash can come from retained earnings, issuing new shares (equity), or debt. In the case of the first and second options, the ROE will reflect this use of cash, for growth. In the latter case, the use of debt will improve the returns, but will not change the equity. In this manner the use of debt will boost ROE, even though the core economics of the business stay the same.Story continuesSouthern's Debt And Its 9.2% ROESouthern does use a high amount of debt to increase returns. It has a debt to equity ratio of 1.55. Its ROE is quite low, even with the use of significant debt; that's not a good result, in our opinion. Debt increases risk and reduces options for the company in the future, so you generally want to see some good returns from using it.SummaryReturn on equity is one way we can compare its business quality of different companies. Companies that can achieve high returns on equity without too much debt are generally of good quality. If two companies have around the same level of debt to equity, and one has a higher ROE, I'd generally prefer the one with higher ROE.But when a business is high quality, the market often bids it up to a price that reflects this. Profit growth rates, versus the expectations reflected in the price of the stock, are a particularly important to consider. So I think it may be worth checking this free report on analyst forecasts for the company.But note: Southern may not be the best stock to buy. So take a peek at this free list of interesting companies with high ROE and low debt.Have feedback on this article? Concerned about the content? Get in touch with us directly.

While this might not raise any eyebrows, if the P/E ratio is not justified investors could be missing out on a potential opportunity or ignoring looming disappointment.Recent times have been advantageous for Northrop Grumman as its earnings have been rising faster than most other companies. One possibility is that the P/E is moderate because investors think this strong earnings performance might be about to tail off. If you like the company, you'd be hoping this isn't the case so that you could potentially pick up some stock while it's not quite in favour. Check out our latest analysis for Northrop Grumman peIf you'd like to see what analysts are forecasting going forward, you should check out our free report on Northrop Grumman.Does Growth Match The P/E?There's an inherent assumption that a company should be matching the market for P/E ratios like Northrop Grumman's to be considered reasonable.If we review the last year of earnings growth, the company posted a terrific increase of 25%. Pleasingly, EPS has also lifted 103% in aggregate from three years ago, thanks to the last 12 months of growth. So we can start by confirming that the company has done a great job of growing earnings over that time.Looking ahead now, EPS is anticipated to slump, contracting by 7.4% each year during the coming three years according to the analysts following the company. With the market predicted to deliver 9.3% growth per annum, that's a disappointing outcome.In light of this, it's somewhat alarming that Northrop Grumman's P/E sits in line with the majority of other companies. It seems most investors are hoping for a turnaround in the company's business prospects, but the analyst cohort is not so confident this will happen. There's a good chance these shareholders are setting themselves up for future disappointment if the P/E falls to levels more in line with the negative growth outlook.Story continuesWhat We Can Learn From Northrop Grumman's P/E?We'd say the price-to-earnings ratio's power isn't primarily as a valuation instrument but rather to gauge current investor sentiment and future expectations.Our examination of Northrop Grumman's analyst forecasts revealed that its outlook for shrinking earnings isn't impacting its P/E as much as we would have predicted. Right now we are uncomfortable with the P/E as the predicted future earnings are unlikely to support a more positive sentiment for long. Unless these conditions improve, it's challenging to accept these prices as being reasonable.There are also other vital risk factors to consider before investing and we've discovered 2 warning signs for Northrop Grumman that you should be aware of.Of course, you might find a fantastic investment by looking at a few good candidates. So take a peek at this free list of companies with a strong growth track record, trading on a P/E below 20x. Have feedback on this article? Concerned about the content? Get in touch with us directly.

For more countries, head on over to 5 Most Advanced Countries in Military Technology. Military technology, or the use of technology for the brutal art of warfare, is one of the oldest domains in human history. From the caveman using a simple spear to today's high end stealth fighter jets and drones, this field has continuously evolved and is a primary contributor to the ability of armed forces to see the tide of war turn in their favor.In terms of monetary value, defense items are among the most expensive in the world. The U.S.' crown jewel fighter jet, the F-22 Raptor, costs the USAF a cool $120 million to purchase exclusive of development costs and more than $68,000 (higher than the average U.S. income) to operate per hour. The industry itself stood at $474 billion last year and will grow to $513 billion this year with a compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) of 8.2%. Top American firms, which are also the leading players globally, which manufacturer hypersonics, fighter aircraft, and atom bombs are Lockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE:LMT), Northrop Grumman Corporation (NYSE:NOC), Aerojet Rocketdyne Holdings, Inc. (NYSE:AJRD), and The Boeing Company (NYSE:BA).Out of these, Lockheed is the most versatile, as it is involved in making hypersonic vehicles, nuclear weapons, and the leading fighter aircraft in the world. Its F-22 Raptor is the world's oldest fighter jet. However, Northrop is known for its bombers and drones, and its latest B-21 Raider bomber revealed in December 2022 is a sight to behold.Photo by Joel Rivera-Camacho on UnsplashOur Methodology We studied a wide variety of factors to determine the world's most technologically advanced countries. However, to rank the countries, we have first listed down today's great power nations that are able to project military power globally.

You can skip our detailed analysis of the relationship between crime and economic growth around the world and go directly to 5 Most Dangerous Countries in the World in 2022. Crime, Instability and EconomyResearch from Auburn University shows that for an increase of 10% in crime in a country with a mean population of 25 million, it loses $225 million (adjusted for inflation in 2022) in revenue from tourism annually. Moreover, the EGADE Business School of Mexico studied the effects of crime on the inflow of Direct Foreign Investment (DFI) in the country from 2005-2015 and found that homicides and robberies had a statistically-significant negative effect on DFI-inflows during the period. For every 1% increase in homicides, there was a decrease of 0.28% in foreign investment. Robberies had a bigger effect, with 0.33% loss in DFI for every 1% increase in robberies. As far as political instability goes, it has been shown to be positively correlated with crime and most likely has a multiplying effect on the latter. The US, as the dominant military and economic power in the world, has intervened in several countries to prevent political instability. It is able to enforce the rules-based order owing to its military superiority, thanks to defense-technology companies like Lockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE:LMT), Northrop Grumman Corporation (NYSE:NOC) and Raytheon Technologies Corporation (NYSE:RTX).Mitigating StrategiesWe’ve focused on crime in this section since political instability does not have a one-size-fits-all solution. Even in crime, the best bet is to prevent it practically in the most efficient way possible until there’s a unified criminal theory that captures all its nuance. In this respect, the concept of smart cities shows promise. It comprises three layers: technology like smartphones and communication networks like the internet, digital applications that mine insights from big-data, and city-wide implementation frameworks. Story continuesIn terms of crimes in mega cities that are economically important and hard to manage, incidents like robberies, car-theft and burglary could be reduced by 30-40% while response time could be cut by 20-35% using smart city concepts with statistical crime-hot-area flagging and data-driven policing etc. This should of course be done in a manner that does not reinforce stereotypes and endanger certain minorities, compromise people’s liberties or reduce human dignity to data and AI. Photo by Peter Scherbatykh on UnsplashOur MethodologyFor our list of the 25 most dangerous countries in the world in 2022, we’ve defined a dangerous country as one with a high crime rate, high levels of political instability and general violence. For this purpose, we’ve used data from the Global Peace Index (GPI) 2022 by the Economics and Peace Organization.The Global Peace Index measures the danger in countries on a scale of 1 to 5, with higher scores relating to higher danger. It accounts for factors like political instability, violent crime rate, external conflict, intensity of internal conflict and terrorism etc. However, as it additionally also accounts for factors that are irrelevant insofar as danger goes, we’ve used data from sources like The World Bank and Insight Crime as well.25. KenyaGPI Score: 2.30Kenya is dangerous enough for the State Department to warn the US citizens to exercise caution when traveling to the country due to terrorist incidents and violent crime in areas of Turkana and the Kenya-Somalia border. 24. Mozambique GPI Score: 2.31Mozambique is the 24th most dangerous country in the world. While it is not as dangerous as many other countries on the list, the US State Department still recommends caution due to rampant incidents of mugging in the country. Some districts in the province of Cabo Delgado are also threatened with terrorism.23. BurundiGPI Score: 2.47Burundi is a landlocked country located in Southeast Africa. Petty as well as violent crimes are common throughout the country. It is also subject to armed attacks carried out by groups operating out of the eastern Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) in the provinces of Cibitoke and Bubanza, close to the border with the DRC and Rwanda. 22. EritreaGPI Score: 2.49Eritrea, officially called the State of Eritrea, is a country located in the Horn of Africa. According to the Organized Crime Index, the estimated prevalence of human trafficking in Eritrea is the highest in all of Africa. In addition, the country’s remote areas are full of landmines. 21. ChadGPI Score: 2.59Chad is a landlocked country in Africa. The north and east of the country are home to a number of paramilitary organizations and insurgents. These organizations engage in numerous forms of trafficking, including human trafficking. In the extreme north and east of the nation, there is a profusion of  unorganized bandits, outlaws, robbers, and road gangs.20. BurmaGPI Score: 2.63Burma is located in Southeast Asia. Many organized and dangerous armed groups operate in the country, with the United-Wa-State-Army being the largest group. Burma’s military is also known to be notoriously brutal, and involved in criminal activities. 19. NigerGPI Score: 2.65Niger is a landlocked country located in West Africa. It is rampant with petty crime, homicides, terrorism and political turmoil. Terrorists are active throughout northern Niger and in the regions bordering Burkina Faso, Mali, and Libya. Crime is especially high in the Niger capital, Niamey. 18. CameroonGPI Score: 2.70Cameroon is located in Central Africa and is one of the most dangerous countries in the world in 2022, mainly due to terrorism and crime. Boko Haram, a terrorist organization active in the country, carries out criminal activities like kidnapping-for-ransom, burglary and extortion, to finance its operations. Members of secessionist organizations also operate as criminal organizations in the Southwest and Northwest regions of Cameroon, where they intimidate business owners with violence to extract money.17. NigeriaGPI Score: 2.72Nigeria is the most populous country from Africa to make it to the list of most dangerous countries in the world in 2022. It is home to multiple criminal syndicates like Area Boys and Black Axe. Crimes of both violent and petty nature are common throughout the country, in addition to terrorist incidents carried out by Boko Haram and Islamic State West Africa.16. ColombiaGPI Score: 2.72Colombia is located in Latin America.

Earning passive income is great in good times and in bad. That’s because in difficult times like this, the downside many investors would otherwise see via valuation compression can be muted by the cash dividends paid by many companies. It’s a simple idea, but one that many long-term investors latch on to, for good reason.Indeed, it’s generally a good idea to try to get a return on any investment. By building up a cash position through dividends, investors can buy dips when available, and also diversify their portfolio from time to time. Holding cash is another option, for those particularly concerned about this near-term environment.With inflation appearing to have peaked and fears of a recession dimming somewhat, investors have some positive catalysts to look forward to. Thus, we could have some capital appreciation in the cards for 2023. If that’s the case, these dividend stocks to buy may show middle-of-the pack returns for investors. Aggressive growth investors may once again outperform, if risk-on sentiment takes hold again.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsWe’ll see. But for defensive investors, allocating at least a portion of one’s portfolio to dividend paying stocks has proven to be a great way to go. Here are three such stocks I think are worth considering right now.DVNDevon Energy$61.92VZVerizon Communications$37.45VFCV.F. Corp.$28.04Devon Energy (DVN)The logo for Devon Energy (DVN) is displayed on a sign outside an office.Source: Jeff Whyte / Shutterstock.comStarting off this list of dividend stocks to buy is Devon Energy (NYSE:DVN), a company that’s become well known for its incredible recent dividend prowess.This company’s incredible 8.8% yield has provided many dividend investors with a source of great income this year. Indeed, any stock with a less than 12-year payback based on the current dividend rate is one worth considering.Story continuesThat said, Devon’s fixed-plus-variable dividend won’t be as attractive in a lower priced oil environment. While high today, the variable portion of this distribution is what has some investors concerned. It’s likely Devon will see some sort of reduction in its dividend next year, a fact that has led this stock to trade at only 6.3x trailing earnings.I think that’s perfectly amenable for short-, medium- and long-term investors. The fact that Devon’s dividend is variable should be viewed as a positive. When times are good, and cash flows are robust, this is a company that will return cash to shareholders in a big way. However, when times get tough, this is a company that will keep that cash, pay down debt and bolster its balance sheet. Accordingly, this is the perfect dividend stock for cautious investors looking to navigate the markets in 2023.Verizon Communications (VZ)5G stocks, VZ stockSource: Ken Wolter / Shutterstock.comA stable long-term holding for many dividend investors, Verizon Communications (NYSE:VZ) fits into most investors’ risk profiles as among the top dividend stocks to buy for years to come. That’s because this company’s 6.9% dividend yield is supported by one of the largest networks in the U.S., and a business model with pricing power in nearly any market.Interestingly, in a recession, the cell phone bill has been shown to be among the stickiest for consumers (one of the last to be repaid). You’d think that shelter, food and other essential costs would come above a telecom bill. But that’s not the case – our ability to communicate and browse the Internet appears to be a core necessity that’s undervalued by many investors.Thus, this is a stock with rather steady cash flows. That’s been a good and bad thing for Verizon, as this stream of steady cash flows has allowed the company to increase its leverage of late, hampering its potential for future returns down the road. Despite revenue growth of 4% in Q3 to $34.2 billion, which outdid estimates by $410 million, some are concerned about the company’s long-term financial picture. That makes sense, considering adjusted earnings came in lower than expected last quarter as well.That said, I’m of the view that Verizon is a reliable long-term blue-chip dividend stock worth buying on a dip. Now trading at a discount of more than 30% to its peak, this is a stock that’s looking more attractive than we’ve seen in some time.V.F. Corp. (VFC)Image of a giant boot in the street surrounded by people.Source: rblfmr / Shutterstock.comOne company I’ve been bullish on for some time, but has underperformed of late, is V.F. Corp. (NYSE:VFC). For investors intent on holding this company for the long term, this recent decline could bode well, at least in terms of this company’s higher yield. At the time of writing, VFC stock yields a very juicy 7.2%, far better than anything investors can get in the fixed income market without taking significant risk.Of course, there’s risk with holding VFC stock, to be sure. This is a stock that’s declined more than 60% on a year-to-date basis alone. Reaching for yield can turn out to be a dangerous move, and this is a stock that many view as a yield trap, for this reason.That said, V.F. Corp’s umbrella of brands is impressive. This company has top-tier retail names in its portfolio, including the likes of Timberland, The North Face, Dickies, Vans, Eastpack and Jansport. For those seeking quality retail exposure, this is one way to go.Another way to view the decline in VFC stock this year is as an opportunity to pick up a much better dividend yield at a low entry cost. This is a profitable company, trading at a reasonable multiple, in an economically sensitive sector. Thus, for those taking a more bullish stance on the economy for 2023, this is among the best dividend stocks to buy right now.On the date of publication, Chris MacDonald did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.Chris MacDonald’s love for investing led him to pursue an MBA in Finance and take on a number of management roles in corporate finance and venture capital over the past 15 years.

61,f8a85ccf-9e98-3626-a8bf-8fdfbd915823,PFE,2022-12-18,Why Investors Shouldn't Be Surprised By Pfizer Inc.'s (NYSE:PFE) Low P/E,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/why-investors-shouldnt-surprised-pfizer-130024744.html,1671368424,STORY,['PFE'],"[Pfizer Inc.'s (NYSE:PFE) price-to-earnings (or ""P/E"") ratio of 9.6x might make it look like a buy right now compared to the market in the United States, where around half of the companies have P/E ratios above 15x and even P/E's above 29x are quite common. However, the P/E might be low for a reason and it requires further investigation to determine if it's justified.With earnings growth that's superior to most other companies of late, Pfizer has been doing relatively well. It might be that many expect the strong earnings performance to degrade substantially, which has repressed the P/E. If not, then existing shareholders have reason to be quite optimistic about the future direction of the share price. View our latest analysis for Pfizer peWant the full picture on analyst estimates for the company? Then our free report on Pfizer will help you uncover what's on the horizon.What Are Growth Metrics Telling Us About The Low P/E?The only time you'd be truly comfortable seeing a P/E as low as Pfizer's is when the company's growth is on track to lag the market.Taking a look back first, we see that the company grew earnings per share by an impressive 54% last year. Pleasingly, EPS has also lifted 85% in aggregate from three years ago, thanks to the last 12 months of growth. Therefore, it's fair to say the earnings growth recently has been superb for the company.Turning to the outlook, the next three years should bring diminished returns, with earnings decreasing 14% per year as estimated by the analysts watching the company. Meanwhile, the broader market is forecast to expand by 9.3% per annum, which paints a poor picture.With this information, we are not surprised that Pfizer is trading at a P/E lower than the market. Nonetheless, there's no guarantee the P/E has reached a floor yet with earnings going in reverse. There's potential for the P/E to fall to even lower levels if the company doesn't improve its profitability.The Final WordTypically, we'd caution against reading too much into price-to-earnings ratios when settling on investment decisions, though it can reveal plenty about what other market participants think about the company.Story continuesWe've established that Pfizer maintains its low P/E on the weakness of its forecast for sliding earnings, as expected. Right now shareholders are accepting the low P/E as they concede future earnings probably won't provide any pleasant surprises. It's hard to see the share price rising strongly in the near future under these circumstances.It's always necessary to consider the ever-present spectre of investment risk. We've identified 1 warning sign with Pfizer, and understanding should be part of your investment process.It's important to make sure you look for a great company, not just the first idea you come across. So take a peek at this free list of interesting companies with strong recent earnings growth (and a P/E ratio below 20x).Have feedback on this article? Concerned about the content?

To skip our detailed analysis, you can go directly to see the 5 Most Diverse Companies in the US.Amid a growing pressure from investors and convincing evidence of economic benefits, companies have started to take ESG (environmental, social and governance) principles very seriously. Over the past few years we have seen a dramatic rise in activist investors pushing major companies to follow ESG practices. Studies also show that ESG is directly linked to economic benefits. For example, a study by Moore Global, which included 1,262 large companies from eight major economies, found that companies that took ESG seriously saw their revenue grow twice the rate of those that are not as committed to ESG. The study also found that profits for companies that stick to ESG principles rose three times faster than those less keen on ESG. The study also said that about 83% of companies invested in ESG reported improved customer retention, while 84% reported that ESG practices improved their ability to attract external investment.Investors are also flocking to companies with strong ESG practices because there’s real money to be made in ESG investing. A 2019 report by McKinsey showed that global sustainable investing topped $30 trillion, a whopping 68% rise from 2014. The climate change problem and increasing awareness about human rights would only increase opportunities in the ESG space.The importance of ESG in investing space can be gauged from the fact that the US government is initiating several actions to enforce companies to stick to ESG rules. The Securities and Exchange Commission is working to develop a common benchmark on how sustainable products are assessed and reported. However, such practices also resulted in a backlash from several companies.Data from Bloomberg Intelligence shows that global ESG assets are expected to surpass a whopping $50 trillion by 2025.Story continuesTo rank the most diverse companies in the U.S., we considered rankings by major publications including Forbes, Fortune, Vervoe and Diversity Inc.

Given that stock prices are usually aligned with a company's financial performance in the long-term, we decided to study its financial indicators more closely to see if they had a hand to play in the recent price move. Particularly, we will be paying attention to Marathon Petroleum's  ROE today.Return on equity or ROE is a key measure used to assess how efficiently a company's management is utilizing the company's capital. Simply put, it is used to assess the profitability of a company in relation to its equity capital. Check out our latest analysis for Marathon Petroleum How Do You Calculate Return On Equity?Return on equity can be calculated by using the formula:Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' EquitySo, based on the above formula, the ROE for Marathon Petroleum is:40% = US$14b ÷ US$34b (Based on the trailing twelve months to September 2022).The 'return' is the profit over the last twelve months. One way to conceptualize this is that for each $1 of shareholders' capital it has, the company made $0.40 in profit.What Has ROE Got To Do With Earnings Growth?So far, we've learned that ROE is a measure of a company's profitability. Based on how much of its profits the company chooses to reinvest or ""retain"", we are then able to evaluate a company's future ability to generate profits. Generally speaking, other things being equal, firms with a high return on equity and profit retention, have a higher growth rate than firms that don’t share these attributes.A Side By Side comparison of Marathon Petroleum's Earnings Growth And 40% ROEFirstly, we acknowledge that Marathon Petroleum has a significantly high ROE. Secondly, even when compared to the industry average of 32% the company's ROE is quite impressive. Despite this, Marathon Petroleum's five year net income growth was quite flat over the past five years. We reckon that there could be some other factors at play here that's limiting the company's growth. These include low earnings retention or poor allocation of capitalStory continuesAs a next step, we compared Marathon Petroleum's net income growth with the industry and discovered that the industry saw an average growth of 6.8% in the same period.past-earnings-growthEarnings growth is an important metric to consider when valuing a stock. What investors need to determine next is if the expected earnings growth, or the lack of it, is already built into the share price. By doing so, they will have an idea if the stock is headed into clear blue waters or if swampy waters await. What is MPC worth today? The  intrinsic value infographic in our free research report  helps visualize whether MPC is currently mispriced by the market.Is Marathon Petroleum Using Its Retained Earnings Effectively?Marathon Petroleum has a low three-year median payout ratio of 11% (or a retention ratio of 89%) but the negligible earnings growth number doesn't reflect this as high growth usually follows high profit retention.In addition, Marathon Petroleum has been paying dividends over a period of at least ten years suggesting that keeping up dividend payments is way more important to the management even if it comes at the cost of business growth. Our latest analyst data shows that the future payout ratio of the company is expected to rise to 27% over the next three years. Consequently, the higher expected payout ratio explains the decline in the company's expected ROE (to 17%) over the same period.SummaryIn total, it does look like Marathon Petroleum has some positive aspects to its business. Although, we are disappointed to see a lack of growth in earnings even in spite of a high ROE and and a high reinvestment rate. We believe that there might be some outside factors that could be having a negative impact on the business. Additionally, the latest industry analyst forecasts show that analysts expect the company's earnings to continue to shrink in the future.

This article is for those who would like to learn about Return On Equity (ROE). By way of learning-by-doing, we'll look at ROE to gain a better understanding of McCormick &amp; Company, Incorporated (NYSE:MKC).ROE or return on equity is a useful tool to assess how effectively a company can generate returns on the investment it received from its shareholders. In simpler terms, it measures the profitability of a company in relation to shareholder's equity. See our latest analysis for McCormick How To Calculate Return On Equity?The formula for return on equity is:Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' EquitySo, based on the above formula, the ROE for McCormick is:15% = US$694m ÷ US$4.6b (Based on the trailing twelve months to August 2022).The 'return' is the profit over the last twelve months. That means that for every $1 worth of shareholders' equity, the company generated $0.15 in profit.Does McCormick Have A Good ROE?Arguably the easiest way to assess company's ROE is to compare it with the average in its industry. The limitation of this approach is that some companies are quite different from others, even within the same industry classification. The image below shows that McCormick has an ROE that is roughly in line with the Food industry average (13%).roeThat isn't amazing, but it is respectable. Even if the ROE is respectable when compared to the industry, its worth checking if the firm's ROE is being aided by high debt levels. If a company takes on too much debt, it is at higher risk of defaulting on interest payments.  Our risks dashboardshould have the 3 risks we have identified for McCormick.How Does Debt Impact Return On Equity?Virtually all companies need money to invest in the business, to grow profits. The cash for investment can come from prior year profits (retained earnings), issuing new shares, or borrowing. In the case of the first and second options, the ROE will reflect this use of cash, for growth. In the latter case, the use of debt will improve the returns, but will not change the equity. That will make the ROE look better than if no debt was used.Story continuesMcCormick's Debt And Its 15% ROEMcCormick does use a high amount of debt to increase returns. It has a debt to equity ratio of 1.17. While its ROE is respectable, it is worth keeping in mind that there is usually a limit as to how much debt a company can use. Debt increases risk and reduces options for the company in the future, so you generally want to see some good returns from using it.ConclusionReturn on equity is one way we can compare its business quality of different companies. A company that can achieve a high return on equity without debt could be considered a high quality business. If two companies have the same ROE, then I would generally prefer the one with less debt.But when a business is high quality, the market often bids it up to a price that reflects this. It is important to consider other factors, such as future profit growth -- and how much investment is required going forward. So you might want to take a peek at this data-rich interactive graph of forecasts for the company.If you would prefer check out another company -- one with potentially superior financials -- then do not miss this free list of interesting companies, that have HIGH return on equity and low debt.Have feedback on this article?

Using the most recent financial data, we'll take a look at whether the stock is fairly priced by taking the expected future cash flows and discounting them to their present value. We will use the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model on this occasion. There's really not all that much to it, even though it might appear quite complex.Remember though, that there are many ways to estimate a company's value, and a DCF is just one method. If you want to learn more about discounted cash flow, the rationale behind this calculation can be read in detail in the Simply Wall St analysis model. View our latest analysis for CSX The ModelWe use what is known as a 2-stage model, which simply means we have two different periods of growth rates for the company's cash flows. Generally the first stage is higher growth, and the second stage is a lower growth phase. In the first stage we need to estimate the cash flows to the business over the next ten years. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.A DCF is all about the idea that a dollar in the future is less valuable than a dollar today, so we need to discount the sum of these future cash flows to arrive at a present value estimate:10-year free cash flow (FCF) forecast2023202420252026202720282029203020312032 Levered FCF ($, Millions) US$3.54bUS$3.69bUS$3.70bUS$3.76bUS$3.81bUS$3.87bUS$3.94bUS$4.01bUS$4.09bUS$4.16bGrowth Rate Estimate SourceAnalyst x9Analyst x5Analyst x2Analyst x1Est @ 1.49%Est @ 1.64%Est @ 1.74%Est @ 1.81%Est @ 1.86%Est @ 1.90% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 7.9% US$3.3kUS$3.2kUS$2.9kUS$2.8kUS$2.6kUS$2.4kUS$2.3kUS$2.2kUS$2.1kUS$1.9k(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$26bStory continuesWe now need to calculate the Terminal Value, which accounts for all the future cash flows after this ten year period. The Gordon Growth formula is used to calculate Terminal Value at a future annual growth rate equal to the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield of 2.0%. We discount the terminal cash flows to today's value at a cost of equity of 7.9%.Terminal Value (TV)= FCF2032 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$4.2b× (1 + 2.0%) ÷ (7.9%– 2.0%) = US$71bPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$71b÷ ( 1 + 7.9%)10= US$33bThe total value is the sum of cash flows for the next ten years plus the discounted terminal value, which results in the Total Equity Value, which in this case is US$59b. The last step is to then divide the equity value by the number of shares outstanding. Compared to the current share price of US$31.7, the company appears around fair value at the time of writing. The assumptions in any calculation have a big impact on the valuation, so it is better to view this as a rough estimate, not precise down to the last cent.dcfThe AssumptionsNow the most important inputs to a discounted cash flow are the discount rate, and of course, the actual cash flows. Part of investing is coming up with your own evaluation of a company's future performance, so try the calculation yourself and check your own assumptions. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at CSX as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 7.9%, which is based on a levered beta of 1.070. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.SWOT Analysis for CSXStrengthEarnings growth over the past year exceeded its 5-year average.Debt is well covered by earnings and cashflows.Dividends are covered by earnings and cash flows.WeaknessEarnings growth over the past year underperformed the Transportation industry.Dividend is low compared to the top 25% of dividend payers in the Transportation market.OpportunityAnnual earnings are forecast to grow for the next 3 years.Good value based on P/E ratio compared to estimated Fair P/E ratio.ThreatAnnual earnings are forecast to grow slower than the American market.Moving On:Whilst important, the DCF calculation shouldn't be the only metric you look at when researching a company. The DCF model is not a perfect stock valuation tool. Instead the best use for a DCF model is to test certain assumptions and theories to see if they would lead to the company being undervalued or overvalued. If a company grows at a different rate, or if its cost of equity or risk free rate changes sharply, the output can look very different.

If you want to see more cheap NASDAQ stocks to buy, go directly to 5 Cheap NASDAQ Stocks to Buy.NASDAQ stocks are stocks listed on stock exchange named, 'The Nasdaq Stock Market', which is also commonly just known as the Nasdaq.In terms of the Nasdaq, it is the largest U.S. equities exchange by volume and also the first electronic stock exchange in the world given its founding in 1971. As an electronic stock exchange, the Nasdaq has no psychical trading floors and is instead built on an automated network of computers that match buy and sell orders.By being fully electronic, there is potential for the Nasdaq to be faster than its main competitor, The New York Stock Exchange, which has a hybrid system that includes both an electronic trading network and a physical trading floor.As an electronic only stock exchange, it is perhaps more fitting that the Nasdaq is home to many big tech companies such as Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META), Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), and Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) whose stocks are listed on the exchange.Given the growth of the technology industry in the last three decades, the market capitalization of some of the stocks listed on the Nasdaq has increased substantially.2022Given high inflation in 2022, the Federal Reserve has raised interest rates seven times this year. As a result of the interest rate increases, Treasury yields have increased substantially and capital has moved from the tech sector into U.S. government bonds as a result.As a result of the capital outflow, the valuations of many growth companies and big tech companies listed on the Nasdaq have decreased.The Nasdaq Composite, which is a market capitalization weighted stock market index that includes nearly all of the stocks listed on the Nasdaq stock exchange, has decreased substantially as a result.Given the decrease, some leading blue chip stocks listed on the Nasdaq arguably trade below their intrinsic values, which make them potentially 'cheap' stocks.Story continuesGiven the uncertainty, it could be a good idea for long term investors to own a well diversified portfolio of stocks across many different sectors, however.AmazonPhoto by Bryan Angelo on UnsplashMethodologyFor our list of 11 Cheap NASDAQ Stocks to Buy, we picked 11 stocks listed on the Nasdaq that had competitive competitive advantages that arguably trade below their intrinsic values.We then ranked the stocks based on the number of hedge funds in our database that held shares in the same stock at the end of Q3.For those of you interested, check out 15 Biggest Global Tech Companies by Market Cap.11 Cheap NASDAQ Stocks to Buy11. Nasdaq, Inc. (NASDAQ:NDAQ)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 32Nasdaq, Inc. (NASDAQ:NDAQ) is the owner of the stock exchange named, 'The Nasdaq Stock Market'. While shares of Nasdaq, Inc. (NASDAQ:NDAQ) have declined 13.4% year to date, the company's most recent quarterly earnings have nevertheless increased.For Q3, Nasdaq, Inc. (NASDAQ:NDAQ)'s third quarter net sales rose 6% year over year and adjusted diluted EPS increased 15% year over year to $0.68 per share.Although its valuation could decrease in the near term if overall tech valuations decrease, Nasdaq, Inc. (NASDAQ:NDAQ) could nevertheless prove cheap in the long term if it continues its earnings growth.Alongside Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META), Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), and Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), Nasdaq, Inc. (NASDAQ:NDAQ) is a NASDAQ stock that many hedge funds in our database owned at the end of Q3.10. ASML Holding N.V. (NASDAQ:ASML)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 51ASML Holding N.V. (NASDAQ:ASML) is a leading maker of semiconductor production equipment. Given the barriers to entry in the company's niche, ASML Holding N.V. (NASDAQ:ASML) has very few legitimate competitors. As a result, ASML Holding N.V. (NASDAQ:ASML) has substantial pricing power and substantial earnings growth potential given the expected increases in semiconductor demand in the future.Although its shares trade for a forward P/E ratio of 30.02, ASML Holding N.V. (NASDAQ:ASML)'s high quality business and its earnings growth potential make the stock cheap.9. CME Group Inc. (NASDAQ:CME)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 60CME Group Inc. (NASDAQ:CME) is a marketplace company that operates the world's largest financial derivatives exchange. While its shares have declined 25.1% year to date, CME Group Inc. (NASDAQ:CME)'s business remains relatively steady, which arguably could make the stock cheap in the long term. In terms of the marketplace's November statistics, average daily volume rose 1% year over year to 23.5 million contracts, representing the highest November volume on record.Baron Funds commented on CME Group Inc. (NASDAQ:CME) in a Q3 2022 investor letter,CME Group Inc. (NASDAQ:CME) operates the world’s largest and most diversified derivatives marketplace. Shares fell 13% during the quarter (despite reporting strong average daily trading volume growth of 26% year-over year) due to concerns that EPS growth will slow in 2023 as the rate hike cycle comes to an end. We continue to own the stock due to CME’s strong competitive moats, its product breadth and liquidity depth, its durable growth characteristics driven by the secular shift from uncleared over-the-counter trading to exchange-traded futures, and tailwinds from the rising rate environment.8. CSX Corporation (NASDAQ:CSX)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 61Given its year to date decline of 15.82%, CSX Corporation (NASDAQ:CSX) trades for a forward P/E ratio of 16.65, which is attractive in terms of the long term given railroad's competitive advantages.Considering railroads are an oligopoly, CSX Corporation (NASDAQ:CSX) has pricing power which helps the company increase earnings despite the tough macroeconomic environment. For Q3, CSX Corporation (NASDAQ:CSX)'s diluted EPS rose 21% year over year to $0.52 and its sales rose 18% year over year to $3.9 billion.Of the 920 hedge funds in our database, 61 owned shares of CSX Corporation (NASDAQ:CSX) at the end of Q3, ranking the stock #8 on our list of 11 Cheap NASDAQ Stocks to Buy.7. PepsiCo, Inc. (NASDAQ:PEP)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 72Beverage and snack maker PepsiCo, Inc. (NASDAQ:PEP) has a high quality business given its shares are near an all time high at a time when the S&amp;P 500 has declined 19.68% year to date and the Nasdaq Composite index has fallen 32.38% year to date.One reason for the strong performance is that analysts expect PepsiCo, Inc. (NASDAQ:PEP) to earn $6.78 per share in 2022, $7.29 per share in 2023, and $7.92 per share in 2024. If PepsiCo, Inc. (NASDAQ:PEP) can keep increasing its earnings like analysts expect, the company could be cheap in the long term.6. Comcast Corporation (NASDAQ:CMCSA)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 73Comcast Corporation (NASDAQ:CMCSA) is a leading entertainment and communications conglomerate whose shares have declined 31.47% year to date. Given the decline, the company trades for a forward P/E ratio of 9.17 which could be cheap if Comcast Corporation (NASDAQ:CMCSA) meets earnings estimates for the future.In terms of the next three years, analysts expect the company to steadily grow profits given the earnings estimate of $3.59 per share in 2022, $3.75 per share in 2023, and $4.18 per share in 2024.Like Comcast Corporation (NASDAQ:CMCSA), Meta Platforms, Inc.

Most former leaders have been jailed or investigated for corruption.The situation has exploded in the last two weeks. Protesters have blocked highways, set buildings on fire and taken over airports in the wake of Castillo's Dec. 7 ouster, hours after he illegally tried to shutter Congress to avoid an impeachment vote he feared losing. At least 18 people have died.Many of the protesters - some Castillo supporters and others simply angry - said they felt ignored by political leaders. Castillo, a former teacher and son of peasant farmers, had at least been one of their own, they said, despite his many flaws.""Nobody represents me now,"" said Huamani, who blames Congress and new president Dina Boluarte, Castillo's former vice president, for the protest deaths. Many like him carry banners calling her a ""murderer"" and demanding she resign.The police and armed forces have been accused by rights groups of using deadly firearms and dropping smoke bombs from helicopters. The military says protesters, most in Peru's Andean south, have used homemade weapons and explosives.Boluarte, Peru's first female president and who can speak Andean indigenous language Quechua, has called for calm and implored Congress to bring forward elections. She has said she will not resign, despite the pressures.Story continues""She only represents the dead,"" Huamani added. ""We elected a humble rural teacher like us, hoping for a revolution that would bring the poor into power.""'NEST OF RATS'Castillo rose unexpectedly to the presidency last year on a wave of support from rural voters fed up with the status quo and what they saw as a corrupt Lima-based political elite.""I was chosen by the forgotten men and women of deep Peru, by the dispossessed who have been neglected for over 200 years,"" Castillo said in a handwritten letter from jail. He is serving 18 months of pretrial detention while being investigated for alleged crimes of rebellion and conspiracy, which he denies.He thanked his supporters for coming out on to the streets and accused the military and police of conducting what he called ""massacres"".""In this difficult context, the coup mongers, exploiting and starving us, today they want to silence my people,"" he wrote.A political rookie, he had won support with pledges to reform the constitution, redistribute huge copper riches and empower marginalized indigenous groups. On many of these promises he failed, his star waning before his ouster. He and his associates faced a spate of corruption probes and he went through five Cabinets and over 80 ministers in just 17 months.But his arrest has erased some of the disappointment. Hundreds of people from Peru's Amazonian jungle, mountain and rural regions have flocked to Lima in his support, including to the jail where he is being held.""The Peruvian people will rise and defend the popular vote,"" supporter Merina Chavez told Reuters outside the prison, aiming her ire at lawmakers. ""Congress did not let him do his job.""Castillo, who ran for the socialist Peru Libre party but later shifted towards the right, faced a hostile and fragmented legislature, where the conservative party of the candidate he narrowly defeated held the largest single bloc.He was impeached three times, the final time being voted out of office by a large majority after his attempt to dissolve Congress sparked resignations by ministers and accusations of a coup by former allies and constitutional officials.Most Peruvians, however, still blame the country's political woes on Congress. Seen as corrupt and self-serving, the parliament has an approval rating of only 11%, according to pollster Datum. Castillo's had been 24% before his removal.In a recent poll some 44% of Peruvians said they supported Castillo's attempt to dissolve the legislature, even though he tried to do it outside constitutional bounds.Outside the Lima jail, Katherine Asto had come to support Castillo wearing a white hat with a slogan making her feelings clear: ""Shut down Congress, it's a nest of rats"".(Reporting by Marco Aquino, Alexander Villegas and Liamar Ramos Writing by Adam Jourdan Editing by Daniel Wallis and Frances Kerry)]"

I'm senior reporter Phil Rosen.Today's newsletter features my conversation with Citi's Ed Morse, one of the top energy economists and oil-market forecasters in the business.In a wide-ranging conversation, he breaks down Russia and the US, crude prices, and more.Then, I've got a full slate of weekend reads just for you, from across Insider's Pulitzer prize-winning newsroom.If this was forwarded to you, sign up here. Download Insider's app here.Ed MorseCitigroupEd Morse is the global head of commodity research at Citi Group. This conversation has been lightly edited for length and clarity. Phil Rosen: What will energy markets look like in 2023, and what's your oil price forecast? Ed Morse: We have an average price for Brent at the end of the year at $76 a barrel. We have WTI ending the year under $70 a barrel. Overall, there will be more market weakness.It'll be another volatile year, but not quite as volatile as 2022. There will be major uncertainty around what we call the ""fragile five"" producers: Iran, Iraq, Nigeria, Libya, and Venezuela. And, Russian supply is less certain than in the past.We have an underlying view that we will see an imbalance between supply and demand across 2023, with significantly more supply coming into the market than demand, leading to inventory builds, which should weigh on prices so that we see prices ending the year on average lower than the beginning.How has Russia's role in energy markets changed since it invaded Ukraine? EM: There's been a critical build up in anti-Russian sentiment in Europe, and a rethinking of that relationship, that Europe is overly dependent on Russian supplies. So we had companies — even before governments got involved — saying they were not going to import Russian oil and gas.The surge in Brent from around $85 to $125 a barrel earlier this year was not a function of supply versus demand, but a function of large distortions in the market in which the readily available supply from a close source was being shunned.Story continuesHow has the US's role changed in global energy markets this year?EM: There was a stunning impact on American oil. The US started the year as a 7-million-barrel-a-day exporter of crude products. As the year is ending, our exports have been averaging closer to 10 million barrels a day, and at times close to 11 million. The US supply system has played a really significant role in filling the gaps.And Wednesday data showed the US was exporting 1.483 million barrels a day of diesel — in other words, there's been a 91.8% increase in US exports in diesel. So US refineries are running all out, we're exporting a hell of a lot.What impact have the West's sanctions had on Russia and markets? EM: The impact of December 5 sanctions was not nearly as great as the impact of the shunning of Russian oil at the beginning of the year.But there's clear evidence that sanctions are having a punitive impact on Russia's natural gas. The argument had been that the actions had not punished Russia, and that the price of oil had gone up, and Russia was receiving more revenue than it otherwise would have. But it turned out that the drop in revenue from natural gas exports being lost to Europe had no replacement whatsoever because there was no other place to sell the gas to, so revenue from gas exports plummeted.By August, Russians felt the impact of less revenue on the natural-gas side. That's as quasi-permanent as anything can be for Russian revenue, and their plans had been to expand Russia's position in the natural gas market, not to contract it. They will never be able to replace the lost supply going to Europe. Russia simply doesn't have the technology or the ability to penetrate markets, given the reputational risk.And on the oil side, the lower prices go, as long as there's a discount on Russian crude, they get punished for it, all else equal.Should energy markets be concerned about the February sanctions on refined Russian fuels? EM: Energy markets have been very concerned about it, but their concern is slowing. The diesel market's been exceptionally tight, and the big gap in Europe's supply has been in diesel, where they have turned to Russia for most supply.But now it's the case that diesel has become more abundant.China is exporting diesel again, and may be exporting a record amount of it by the time we get to the first quarter of 2023. Supply has been building in Europe, with refineries making more diesel on their own. There's more refining capacity available in the world, with Kuwait and Saudi Arabia increasing refining capacity.But the major, astonishing element really is the US, as I said earlier.Read the full feature on Ed Morse.What did you think of Morse's oil price forecast for 2023? Tweet me @philrosenn, or email me prosen@insider.com.Here's what else to read this weekend:photo of Sergey Brin and Larry Page on a neutral background with triangles in the Google colorsGoogle cofounders Sergey Brin and Larry Page have both donated millions to charity through their foundations, but in distinctly different ways.AP; Marianne Ayala/Insider1.

(NYSE:VZ) as an attractive investment with its 8.1x P/E ratio. Although, it's not wise to just take the P/E at face value as there may be an explanation why it's limited.Verizon Communications hasn't been tracking well recently as its declining earnings compare poorly to other companies, which have seen some growth on average. The P/E is probably low because investors think this poor earnings performance isn't going to get any better. If this is the case, then existing shareholders will probably struggle to get excited about the future direction of the share price. Check out our latest analysis for Verizon Communications peIf you'd like to see what analysts are forecasting going forward, you should check out our free report on Verizon Communications.Is There Any Growth For Verizon Communications?There's an inherent assumption that a company should underperform the market for P/E ratios like Verizon Communications' to be considered reasonable.Retrospectively, the last year delivered a frustrating 14% decrease to the company's bottom line. That put a dampener on the good run it was having over the longer-term as its three-year EPS growth is still a noteworthy 18% in total. Accordingly, while they would have preferred to keep the run going, shareholders would be roughly satisfied with the medium-term rates of earnings growth.Shifting to the future, estimates from the analysts covering the company suggest earnings should grow by 4.5% each year over the next three years. With the market predicted to deliver 9.3% growth per year, the company is positioned for a weaker earnings result.In light of this, it's understandable that Verizon Communications' P/E sits below the majority of other companies. Apparently many shareholders weren't comfortable holding on while the company is potentially eyeing a less prosperous future.Story continuesThe Bottom Line On Verizon Communications' P/EWhile the price-to-earnings ratio shouldn't be the defining factor in whether you buy a stock or not, it's quite a capable barometer of earnings expectations.As we suspected, our examination of Verizon Communications' analyst forecasts revealed that its inferior earnings outlook is contributing to its low P/E. Right now shareholders are accepting the low P/E as they concede future earnings probably won't provide any pleasant surprises. It's hard to see the share price rising strongly in the near future under these circumstances.Having said that, be aware  Verizon Communications is showing 2 warning signs in our investment analysis, you should know about.It's important to make sure you look for a great company, not just the first idea you come across.

(NYSE:TPR) as an investment opportunity by projecting its future cash flows and then discounting them to today's value. One way to achieve this is by employing the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model. There's really not all that much to it, even though it might appear quite complex.Remember though, that there are many ways to estimate a company's value, and a DCF is just one method. If you want to learn more about discounted cash flow, the rationale behind this calculation can be read in detail in the Simply Wall St analysis model. View our latest analysis for Tapestry The CalculationWe use what is known as a 2-stage model, which simply means we have two different periods of growth rates for the company's cash flows. Generally the first stage is higher growth, and the second stage is a lower growth phase. To start off with, we need to estimate the next ten years of cash flows. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.A DCF is all about the idea that a dollar in the future is less valuable than a dollar today, so we need to discount the sum of these future cash flows to arrive at a present value estimate:10-year free cash flow (FCF) forecast2023202420252026202720282029203020312032 Levered FCF ($, Millions) US$759.8mUS$1.05bUS$1.16bUS$1.20bUS$1.23bUS$1.25bUS$1.28bUS$1.31bUS$1.33bUS$1.36bGrowth Rate Estimate SourceAnalyst x6Analyst x6Analyst x3Analyst x2Analyst x1Est @ 2.13%Est @ 2.09%Est @ 2.06%Est @ 2.03%Est @ 2.02% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 9.1% US$696US$878US$888US$845US$793US$742US$694US$649US$606US$567(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$7.4bStory continuesThe second stage is also known as Terminal Value, this is the business's cash flow after the first stage. For a number of reasons a very conservative growth rate is used that cannot exceed that of a country's GDP growth. In this case we have used the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield (2.0%) to estimate future growth. In the same way as with the 10-year 'growth' period, we discount future cash flows to today's value, using a cost of equity of 9.1%.Terminal Value (TV)= FCF2032 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$1.4b× (1 + 2.0%) ÷ (9.1%– 2.0%) = US$19bPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$19b÷ ( 1 + 9.1%)10= US$8.1bThe total value, or equity value, is then the sum of the present value of the future cash flows, which in this case is US$15b. To get the intrinsic value per share, we divide this by the total number of shares outstanding. Compared to the current share price of US$36.6, the company appears quite undervalued at a 43% discount to where the stock price trades currently. Valuations are imprecise instruments though, rather like a telescope - move a few degrees and end up in a different galaxy. Do keep this in mind.dcfThe AssumptionsThe calculation above is very dependent on two assumptions. The first is the discount rate and the other is the cash flows. You don't have to agree with these inputs, I recommend redoing the calculations yourself and playing with them. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Tapestry as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 9.1%, which is based on a levered beta of 1.287. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.SWOT Analysis for TapestryStrengthDebt is well covered by earnings and cashflows.Dividends are covered by earnings and cash flows.WeaknessEarnings declined over the past year.Dividend is low compared to the top 25% of dividend payers in the Luxury market.OpportunityAnnual earnings are forecast to grow for the next 3 years.Good value based on P/E ratio and estimated fair value.ThreatAnnual earnings are forecast to grow slower than the American market.Looking Ahead:Although the valuation of a company is important, it is only one of many factors that you need to assess for a company. The DCF model is not a perfect stock valuation tool. Preferably you'd apply different cases and assumptions and see how they would impact the company's valuation. If a company grows at a different rate, or if its cost of equity or risk free rate changes sharply, the output can look very different. Can we work out why the company is trading at a discount to intrinsic value?

In fact, major companies are already betting on that. BP (NYSE:BP), for example, wants to advance the transition to hydrogen and help decarbonize industries with it. Meanwhile, Hyundai (OTC:HYMTF) is trying to dominate the world of hydrogen trucking in the U.S., and Toyota (NYSE:TM) just unveiled a new hydrogen-powered pickup and SUV. Finally, BMW (OTC:BMWYY) will reportedly test its iX5 hydrogen fuel cell SUV  in the spring. Even the UK government wants to ban gas boilers in homes by 2026, replacing them with heating systems that can be fueled with hydrogen. Because of these companies’ efforts on the hydrogen front,  we put together this list of three hot hydrogen stocks to buy.According to the Hydrogen Council, “Hydrogen is central to reaching net zero emissions because it can abate 80 gigatons of CO2 by 2050. Hydrogen has a central role in helping the world reach net-zero emissions by 2050 and limiting global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius. Complementing other decarbonization technologies like renewable power, biofuels, or energy efficiency improvements, clean hydrogen (both renewable and low carbon) offers the only long-term, scalable, and cost-effective option for deep decarbonization.”So it comes as little surprise that some analysts foresee a multi-trillion-dollar hydrogen opportunity.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsGoldman Sachs, for example, believes that the hydrogen space could become a $12 trillion market by 2030. And Bank of America says green hydrogen could be worth more than $11 trillion by 2050, while Morgan Stanley also thinks that hydrogen could become an $11 trillion opportunity. Here are three top hydrogen stocks to buy.HJENDirection Hydrogen ETF$15.05BEBloom Energy$24.17APDAir Products &amp; Chemicals$325Direxion Hydrogen ETF (HJEN)a symbol with H2 (hydrogen) on it and a fill-up tankSource: Alexander Kirch / Shutterstock.comLet’s start out with Direxion Hydrogen ETF (NYSE:HJEN).

Overall, dozens of companies are utilizing Bloom’s products.Bloom’s earnings have been solid. Last quarter, its revenue jumped 41% year-over-year to $292.3 million. Its gross margins slipped only slightly from 17.8% in Q3 of 2021 to 17.4% last quarter.Bloom also strengthened its liquidity position and reaffirmed its full-year revenue guidance of $1.1 billion to $1.15 billion.In another positive development, UBS analyst Manav Gupta initiated BE stock with a “buy” rating and placed a price target of $35 on the name. Jefferies analyst Sam Burwell also initiated coverage with a “buy” rating, and he set a $29 price target on Bloom.Air Products &amp; Chemicals (APD)Air Products (APD) logo on the Arts Quest building, Air Products is a sponsor of Air Products Town Square at Arts Quest in Bethlehem, PASource: Andy Borysowski / Shutterstock.comAir Products &amp; Chemicals (NASDAQ:APD) is another one of the top hydrogen stocks to buy. The company owns and operates more than 100 hydrogen plants around the world. APD has also been involved in more than 250 hydrogen-fueling projects all over the world. and it even fuels cars, trucks, and buses. Most recently, APD announced plans, in partnership with AES, to invest $4 billion in its first huge green hydrogen facility, which will be located in Texas.In fact, according to an APD press release, “This mega-scale renewable power to hydrogen project includes approximately 1.4 gigawatts (GW) of wind and solar power generation, along with electrolyzer capacity capable of producing over 200 metric tons per day (MT/D) of green hydrogen, making it the largest green hydrogen facility in the United States.”Even more impressively,  Deutsche Bank raised its price target on APD to $340 from $292 and kept a “buy” rating on the shares. BMO Capital also raised its price target on the shares, increasing it to $390 from $339. BMO kept an outperform rating on the stock.Air Products declared a quarterly dividend of $1.62 per share.

To skip our detailed analysis, you can go directly to see the 5 Most Diverse Companies in the US.Amid a growing pressure from investors and convincing evidence of economic benefits, companies have started to take ESG (environmental, social and governance) principles very seriously. Over the past few years we have seen a dramatic rise in activist investors pushing major companies to follow ESG practices. Studies also show that ESG is directly linked to economic benefits. For example, a study by Moore Global, which included 1,262 large companies from eight major economies, found that companies that took ESG seriously saw their revenue grow twice the rate of those that are not as committed to ESG. The study also found that profits for companies that stick to ESG principles rose three times faster than those less keen on ESG. The study also said that about 83% of companies invested in ESG reported improved customer retention, while 84% reported that ESG practices improved their ability to attract external investment.Investors are also flocking to companies with strong ESG practices because there’s real money to be made in ESG investing. A 2019 report by McKinsey showed that global sustainable investing topped $30 trillion, a whopping 68% rise from 2014. The climate change problem and increasing awareness about human rights would only increase opportunities in the ESG space.The importance of ESG in investing space can be gauged from the fact that the US government is initiating several actions to enforce companies to stick to ESG rules. The Securities and Exchange Commission is working to develop a common benchmark on how sustainable products are assessed and reported. However, such practices also resulted in a backlash from several companies.Data from Bloomberg Intelligence shows that global ESG assets are expected to surpass a whopping $50 trillion by 2025.Story continuesTo rank the most diverse companies in the U.S., we considered rankings by major publications including Forbes, Fortune, Vervoe and Diversity Inc. If a company was included in multiple lists, it was ranked higher. We also considered the ranking to each company given by each list.Photo by Ant Rozetsky on Unsplash15.

Earning passive income is great in good times and in bad. That’s because in difficult times like this, the downside many investors would otherwise see via valuation compression can be muted by the cash dividends paid by many companies. It’s a simple idea, but one that many long-term investors latch on to, for good reason.Indeed, it’s generally a good idea to try to get a return on any investment. By building up a cash position through dividends, investors can buy dips when available, and also diversify their portfolio from time to time. Holding cash is another option, for those particularly concerned about this near-term environment.With inflation appearing to have peaked and fears of a recession dimming somewhat, investors have some positive catalysts to look forward to. Thus, we could have some capital appreciation in the cards for 2023. If that’s the case, these dividend stocks to buy may show middle-of-the pack returns for investors. Aggressive growth investors may once again outperform, if risk-on sentiment takes hold again.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsWe’ll see. But for defensive investors, allocating at least a portion of one’s portfolio to dividend paying stocks has proven to be a great way to go. Here are three such stocks I think are worth considering right now.DVNDevon Energy$61.92VZVerizon Communications$37.45VFCV.F. Corp.$28.04Devon Energy (DVN)The logo for Devon Energy (DVN) is displayed on a sign outside an office.Source: Jeff Whyte / Shutterstock.comStarting off this list of dividend stocks to buy is Devon Energy (NYSE:DVN), a company that’s become well known for its incredible recent dividend prowess.This company’s incredible 8.8% yield has provided many dividend investors with a source of great income this year. Indeed, any stock with a less than 12-year payback based on the current dividend rate is one worth considering.Story continuesThat said, Devon’s fixed-plus-variable dividend won’t be as attractive in a lower priced oil environment. While high today, the variable portion of this distribution is what has some investors concerned. It’s likely Devon will see some sort of reduction in its dividend next year, a fact that has led this stock to trade at only 6.3x trailing earnings.I think that’s perfectly amenable for short-, medium- and long-term investors. The fact that Devon’s dividend is variable should be viewed as a positive. When times are good, and cash flows are robust, this is a company that will return cash to shareholders in a big way. However, when times get tough, this is a company that will keep that cash, pay down debt and bolster its balance sheet. Accordingly, this is the perfect dividend stock for cautious investors looking to navigate the markets in 2023.Verizon Communications (VZ)5G stocks, VZ stockSource: Ken Wolter / Shutterstock.comA stable long-term holding for many dividend investors, Verizon Communications (NYSE:VZ) fits into most investors’ risk profiles as among the top dividend stocks to buy for years to come. That’s because this company’s 6.9% dividend yield is supported by one of the largest networks in the U.S., and a business model with pricing power in nearly any market.Interestingly, in a recession, the cell phone bill has been shown to be among the stickiest for consumers (one of the last to be repaid). You’d think that shelter, food and other essential costs would come above a telecom bill. But that’s not the case – our ability to communicate and browse the Internet appears to be a core necessity that’s undervalued by many investors.Thus, this is a stock with rather steady cash flows. That’s been a good and bad thing for Verizon, as this stream of steady cash flows has allowed the company to increase its leverage of late, hampering its potential for future returns down the road. Despite revenue growth of 4% in Q3 to $34.2 billion, which outdid estimates by $410 million, some are concerned about the company’s long-term financial picture. That makes sense, considering adjusted earnings came in lower than expected last quarter as well.That said, I’m of the view that Verizon is a reliable long-term blue-chip dividend stock worth buying on a dip. Now trading at a discount of more than 30% to its peak, this is a stock that’s looking more attractive than we’ve seen in some time.V.F. Corp. (VFC)Image of a giant boot in the street surrounded by people.Source: rblfmr / Shutterstock.comOne company I’ve been bullish on for some time, but has underperformed of late, is V.F. Corp. (NYSE:VFC). For investors intent on holding this company for the long term, this recent decline could bode well, at least in terms of this company’s higher yield. At the time of writing, VFC stock yields a very juicy 7.2%, far better than anything investors can get in the fixed income market without taking significant risk.Of course, there’s risk with holding VFC stock, to be sure. This is a stock that’s declined more than 60% on a year-to-date basis alone. Reaching for yield can turn out to be a dangerous move, and this is a stock that many view as a yield trap, for this reason.That said, V.F. Corp’s umbrella of brands is impressive. This company has top-tier retail names in its portfolio, including the likes of Timberland, The North Face, Dickies, Vans, Eastpack and Jansport. For those seeking quality retail exposure, this is one way to go.Another way to view the decline in VFC stock this year is as an opportunity to pick up a much better dividend yield at a low entry cost. This is a profitable company, trading at a reasonable multiple, in an economically sensitive sector. Thus, for those taking a more bullish stance on the economy for 2023, this is among the best dividend stocks to buy right now.On the date of publication, Chris MacDonald did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.Chris MacDonald’s love for investing led him to pursue an MBA in Finance and take on a number of management roles in corporate finance and venture capital over the past 15 years.

We generally consider it a negative if insiders have been selling, especially if they did so below the current price, because it implies that they considered a lower price to be reasonable. Please do note, however, that sellers may have a variety of reasons for selling, so we don't know for sure what they think of the stock price. We note that the biggest single sale was 53% of Ian Borden's holding.All up, insiders sold more shares in McDonald's than they bought, over the last year. You can see a visual depiction of insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last 12 months, below. If you want to know exactly who sold, for how much, and when, simply click on the graph below!insider-trading-volumeIf you are like me, then you will not want to miss this free list of growing companies that insiders are buying.Are McDonald's Insiders Buying Or Selling?Over the last three months, we've seen a bit of insider selling at McDonald's. insider Anthony Capuano divested only US$8.7k worth of shares in that time. Neither the lack of buying nor the presence of selling is heartening. But the volume sold is so low that it really doesn't bother us.Story continuesInsider OwnershipLooking at the total insider shareholdings in a company can help to inform your view of whether they are well aligned with common shareholders. I reckon it's a good sign if insiders own a significant number of shares in the company. It's great to see that McDonald's insiders own 0.09% of the company, worth about US$182m. I like to see this level of insider ownership, because it increases the chances that management are thinking about the best interests of shareholders.So What Does This Data Suggest About McDonald's Insiders?Our data shows a little more insider selling, but no insider buying, in the last three months. But given the selling was modest, we're not worried. It's great to see high levels of insider ownership, but looking back over the last year, we don't gain confidence from the McDonald's insiders selling. So these insider transactions can help us build a thesis about the stock, but it's also worthwhile knowing the risks facing this company. While conducting our analysis, we found that McDonald's has 1 warning sign and it would be unwise to ignore this.Of course, you might find a fantastic investment by looking elsewhere. So take a peek at this free list of interesting companies.For the purposes of this article, insiders are those individuals who report their transactions to the relevant regulatory body.

If you want to see more stocks in this selection, check out Jim Cramer's 5 Favorite Dividend Aristocrats. Jim Cramer, the host of Mad Money on CNBC and an anchor on Squawk on the Street, is one of the most followed television personalities commenting on Wall Street equities. At the end of August this year, Cramer put out a list of his 10 favorite “dividend aristocrats” to buy and hold throughout 2022, noting that their dividend payouts provide a safe haven against Federal Reserve policies and consequent market declines. Cramer observed that dividend aristocrats, which are members of the S&amp;P 500 Index with a history of increasing dividends consistently for at least 25 years, have fared better than the broader U.S. stock index. On December 16, Cramer attempted to address the primary investor concern regarding the United States slipping into a recession in the coming year. He told his viewers on Mad Money: “We want the Fed to talk a big game, without needing to actually do too much. Talk is better than action. We want [Fed Chair Jerome Powell] to scare the economy into slowing under its own weight. We don’t want endless rate hikes ... that will destroy everything in its path.”Jim Cramer made these comments in light of the Fed raising interest rates by half a percentage point to their highest levels in 15 years on December 14. The S&amp;P 500 was also down 5.6% in December, continuing its losing streak for weeks. In this market environment, some of the dividend aristocrats favored by Jim Cramer for 2022 include The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO), Caterpillar Inc. (NYSE:CAT), and McDonald's Corporation (NYSE:MCD). Our MethodologyWe explored the 10 dividend aristocrats that Jim Cramer listed as his favorites on an August 30 segment of CNBC’s Mad Money. We have also mentioned the comments he made about these stocks after August 30, to see whether he stands by his original bullish thesis for all these names. We have assessed the hedge fund sentiment from Insider Monkey’s database of 920 elite hedge funds tracked as of the end of the third quarter of 2022. The list is arranged according to the number of hedge fund holders in each firm. Story continuesJim Cramer's Favorite Dividend AristocratsJim Cramer's Favorite Dividend Aristocrats10. Federal Realty Investment Trust (NYSE:FRT)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 24Dividend Yield as of December 16: 4.13%Federal Realty Investment Trust (NYSE:FRT) is a leader in the ownership and operation of high quality retail properties located in primary coastal markets ranging from Washington to Boston, as well as San Francisco and Los Angeles. Federal Realty Investment Trust (NYSE:FRT) aims to distribute long-term, sustainable growth through investing in areas where retail demand outpaces supply. CNBC’s Jim Cramer said in an episode of Mad Money on August 30 that the REIT yields about 4.2% and owns huge suburban retail properties. The reason Federal Realty Investment Trust (NYSE:FRT) featured as one of Cramer’s favorite dividend aristocrats was because the kind of properties it owns and leases remain resilient despite economic weakness. On September 14, Jim Cramer reiterated his support for Federal Realty Investment Trust (NYSE:FRT), saying:“While most retail stocks are horrible right now … the companies that own the best retail real estate are doing just fine.” On November 3, Federal Realty Investment Trust (NYSE:FRT) reported a Q3 FFO of $1.59 and a revenue of $273.45 million, outperforming Wall Street estimates by $0.06 and $12.29 million, respectively. The company raised its full-year 2022 earnings per diluted share guidance to $3.88-$3.93 and increased full-year FFO per diluted share guidance to $6.27 - $6.32 from the prior outlook of $6.10-$6.25 and a $6.21 consensus. According to Insider Monkey’s data, 24 hedge funds reported owning stakes worth $132 million in Federal Realty Investment Trust (NYSE:FRT) at the end of Q3 2022, compared to the same number of funds in the prior quarter worth $200 million. Like The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO), Caterpillar Inc. (NYSE:CAT), and McDonald's Corporation (NYSE:MCD), Federal Realty Investment Trust (NYSE:FRT) is one of the dividend aristocrats backed by Jim Cramer. 9. Realty Income Corporation (NYSE:O)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 28Dividend Yield as of December 16: 4.61%Realty Income Corporation (NYSE:O) is an S&amp;P 500 company that seeks to deliver shareholders with dependable monthly income. It is a California-based company that invests in free-standing, single-tenant commercial properties in the United States, Spain, and the United Kingdom which are subject to NNN Leases. Cramer noted on an August 30 Mad Money segment that:“The stock’s been punished lately because most retail has been struggling.”He observed that Realty Income Corporation (NYSE:O) has “tons of consistent clients” like drugstores, supermarkets, dollar stores, and convenience stores. He further added: “Best of all, Realty Income pays you a monthly dividend that yields 4.3% here.”Supporting Realty Income Corporation (NYSE:O) further, he said on a September 14 segment of Mad Money:“As long as their tenants stay in business, they won’t take much of a hit financially. To me, that looks like an opportunity.”On December 13, Realty Income Corporation (NYSE:O) declared a $0.2485 per share monthly dividend, a 0.2% increase from its prior dividend of $0.248. The dividend is payable on January 13, 2023 to shareholders of record on January 3. The forward yield was 4.60%. The firm has a history of increasing dividend payouts for 28 consecutive years. According to Insider Monkey’s data, Realty Income Corporation (NYSE:O) was part of 28 hedge fund portfolios at the end of Q3 2022, up from 19 in the prior quarter. Stuart J. Zimmer’s Zimmer Partners is the largest position holder in the company, with 2.90 million shares worth $169 million. 8. Hormel Foods Corporation (NYSE:HRL)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 29Dividend Yield as of December 16: 2.41%Hormel Foods Corporation (NYSE:HRL) was founded in 1891 and is headquartered in Austin, Minnesota. The company develops, processes, and distributes meat, nuts, and food products to retail, foodservice, deli, and commercial customers in the United States and internationally. The company operates through four segments – Grocery Products, Refrigerated Foods, Jennie-O Turkey Store, and International &amp; Other. Jim Cramer said on his Mad Money segment on August 30 that Hormel Foods Corporation (NYSE:HRL) is a classic defensive name, noting that as inflation crushed consumers, Hormel could be “a good trade-down play.”On December 1, Cramer was in conversation with Hormel Foods Corporation (NYSE:HRL)’s CEO, discussing the company's negative Q4 organic volume growth and the recent dividend increase. The CEO reassured Cramer that the company is dedicated to protecting and increasing its dividend payouts, which may not look huge, but it has consistently increased payouts for the last 57 years. Hormel also has a fortress balance sheet and the negative growth is easily compensated by the strong cash position and dividend growth. Hormel Foods Corporation (NYSE:HRL) still remains one of Cramer’s favorite dividend aristocrats. Hormel Foods Corporation (NYSE:HRL) on November 21 declared a quarterly dividend of $0.275 per share, a 5.8% increase from its prior dividend of $0.26. The dividend is distributable on February 15, 2023 to shareholders of record on January 17. According to Insider Monkey’s data, 29 funds reported owning stakes worth $455.8 million in Hormel Foods Corporation (NYSE:HRL) at the end of September 2022, compared to 27 funds in the earlier quarter worth $434.5 million. Jim Simons’ Renaissance Technologies is the leading position holder in the company, with 2.3 million shares worth $106.3 million. Here is what LRT Capital Management has to say about Hormel Foods Corporation (NYSE:HRL) in its Q3 2021 investor letter:“Hormel Foods Corporation (HRL) – the maker of SPAM and Applegate Turkey (among many other products), is down over 20% since peaking last year, largely on fears of higher cost. We expect the company will be able to raise prices to offset cost inflation as they have always been able to win their past.”7. General Dynamics Corporation (NYSE:GD)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 35Dividend Yield as of December 16: 2.06%General Dynamics Corporation (NYSE:GD) was founded in 1899 and is headquartered in Reston, Virginia. It operates as an aerospace and defense company worldwide, and it has four segments – Aerospace, Marine Systems, Combat Systems, and Technologies. On Mad Money’s August-end segment, Jim Cramer said that he is optimistic about the defense industry overall, but General Dynamics Corporation (NYSE:GD) is the only dividend aristocrat in the sector. He told viewers: “Unfortunately, they also have a business jet division that will no doubt get hit if we have a nasty recession, but that hasn’t stopped the stock from rallying 11% this year, aided by a very hands-on management that knows what’s needed in a less secure world.”Cramer also backed General Dynamics Corporation (NYSE:GD) in a May 2020 segment of Mad Money, saying: “You have to take a long view on GD ’cause it’s not the favorite one right now. It’s not the loved one and the whole group is a little under pressure, but I think General Dynamics is a very good long-term hold.”On December 7, General Dynamics Corporation (NYSE:GD) declared a $1.26 per share quarterly dividend, in line with previous. The dividend is payable on February 10, 2023 to shareholders of record on January 20. The quarterly dividend was increased by 6% in 2022 to stretch General Dynamics’ dividend hike streak to 26 years. According to Insider Monkey’s data, General Dynamics Corporation (NYSE:GD) was part of 35 hedge fund portfolios at the end of September 2022, compared to 42 in the prior quarter. James A. Star’s Longview Asset Management is the leading position holder in the company, with 30 million shares worth $6.4 billion. Here is what Oakmark Global Fund has to say about General Dynamics Corporation (NYSE:GD) in their Q1 2021 investor letter:“The second new U.S. equity purchase was General Dynamics, a leading U.S. defense contractor and owner of the world’s premier business jet franchise (Gulfstream). We were able to purchase this high-quality and durable business at a meaningful discount to our estimate of its intrinsic value after a series of near-term concerns hurt its share price. Taking a longer term view, the company’s business jet franchise should benefit from a multi-year investment program in new, differentiated products. Also, its free cash flow conversion is set to improve materially and the company is poised to benefit from a highly visible ramp up in revenue related to next generation nuclear-powered submarines. As these positives come into clearer view, we expect sentiment to improve, along with the company’s share price.”6. Archer-Daniels-Midland Company (NYSE:ADM)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 37Dividend Yield as of December 16: 1.73%Archer-Daniels-Midland Company (NYSE:ADM) procures, transports, processes, and merchandises agricultural commodities in the United States, Switzerland, Cayman Islands, Brazil, Mexico, the United Kingdom, and internationally. The company operates through three segments – Ag Services and Oilseeds, Carbohydrate Solutions, and Nutrition. Jim Cramer told viewers on August 30 that he likes Archer-Daniels-Midland Company (NYSE:ADM) and the potential upside from supply chain disruptions. He also said that the stock has started to rebound from its mid-July bottom, driven by a recovery in crop prices. He called it a “conservative, decent stock.”Jim Cramer reinforced his prior Archer-Daniels-Midland Company (NYSE:ADM) thesis on a December 14 segment of Mad Money, saying that the stock is the best performer in consumer staples space so far this year, and is a winner as long as the Russia-Ukraine war continues. He categorized it as one of the top five consumer staple stocks for 2023.According to Insider Monkey’s Q3 data, 37 hedge funds were long Archer-Daniels-Midland Company (NYSE:ADM), compared to 42 funds in the earlier quarter. Tom Gayner’s Markel Gayner Asset Management is the leading position holder in the company, with nearly 1.5 million shares worth $117.7 million. In addition to The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO), Caterpillar Inc. (NYSE:CAT), and McDonald's Corporation (NYSE:MCD), Archer-Daniels-Midland Company (NYSE:ADM) is one of the favorite dividend aristocrats of Jim Cramer. Here is what Diamond Hill Long-Short Fund has to say about Archer-Daniels-Midland Company (NYSE:ADM) in its Q1 2022 investor letter:“ADM is a leading agricultural processor that also operates a global nutrition business focused on the development of ingredients and flavors for food and beverages, supplements and more. The company’s recent operating results have benefited (unfortunately) from the war in Ukraine as grain prices and agricultural markets globally experienced strong price increases. ADM is positioned well to benefit from the volatility due to its stable North American agricultural base.” Click to continue reading and see Jim Cramer's 5 Favorite Dividend Aristocrats.  Suggested articles:15 Biggest Endowments in the US10 Best Tobacco Stocks To Buy12 Dividend Stocks That Outperform S&amp;P 500 Disclosure: None.

(NASDAQ:MDLZ) is a favorite amongst the big guns",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/78-institutional-ownership-mondelez-international-120051107.html,1671364851,STORY,['MDLZ'],"[Every investor in Mondelez International, Inc. (NASDAQ:MDLZ) should be aware of the most powerful shareholder groups. And the group that holds the biggest piece of the pie are institutions with 78% ownership. Put another way, the group faces the maximum upside potential (or downside risk).Because institutional owners have a huge pool of resources and liquidity, their investing decisions tend to carry a great deal of weight, especially with individual investors. Therefore, a good portion of institutional money invested in the company is usually a huge vote of confidence on its future.In the chart below, we zoom in on the different ownership groups of Mondelez International. View our latest analysis for Mondelez International ownership-breakdownWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Mondelez International?Many institutions measure their performance against an index that approximates the local market. So they usually pay more attention to companies that are included in major indices.Mondelez International already has institutions on the share registry. Indeed, they own a respectable stake in the company. This implies the analysts working for those institutions have looked at the stock and they like it. But just like anyone else, they could be wrong. It is not uncommon to see a big share price drop if two large institutional investors try to sell out of a stock at the same time. So it is worth checking the past earnings trajectory of Mondelez International, (below). Of course, keep in mind that there are other factors to consider, too.earnings-and-revenue-growthInstitutional investors own over 50% of the company, so together than can probably strongly influence board decisions. Mondelez International is not owned by hedge funds. The Vanguard Group, Inc. is currently the company's largest shareholder with 8.9% of shares outstanding. BlackRock, Inc. is the second largest shareholder owning 7.0% of common stock, and State Street Global Advisors, Inc. holds about 4.4% of the company stock.Story continuesOur studies suggest that the top 25 shareholders collectively control less than half of the company's shares, meaning that the company's shares are widely disseminated and there is no dominant shareholder.While studying institutional ownership for a company can add value to your research, it is also a good practice to research analyst recommendations to get a deeper understand of a stock's expected performance. Quite a few analysts cover the stock, so you could look into forecast growth quite easily.Insider Ownership Of Mondelez InternationalThe definition of company insiders can be subjective and does vary between jurisdictions. Our data reflects individual insiders, capturing board members at the very least. The company management answer to the board and the latter should represent the interests of shareholders. Notably, sometimes top-level managers are on the board themselves.Insider ownership is positive when it signals leadership are thinking like the true owners of the company. However, high insider ownership can also give immense power to a small group within the company. This can be negative in some circumstances.Our most recent data indicates that insiders own less than 1% of Mondelez International, Inc.. It is a very large company, so it would be surprising to see insiders own a large proportion of the company. Though their holding amounts to less than 1%, we can see that board members collectively own US$106m worth of shares (at current prices). It is good to see board members owning shares, but it might be worth checking if those insiders have been buying. General Public OwnershipWith a 21% ownership, the general public, mostly comprising of individual investors, have some degree of sway over Mondelez International. While this size of ownership may not be enough to sway a policy decision in their favour, they can still make a collective impact on company policies.Next Steps:It's always worth thinking about the different groups who own shares in a company. But to understand Mondelez International better, we need to consider many other factors. Like risks, for instance. Every company has them, and we've spotted   4 warning signs for Mondelez International   (of which 1 is significant!) you should know about.If you are like me, you may want to think about whether this company will grow or shrink.

98,547c02dc-1b6d-362d-b739-939cd7476dc9,MDLZ,2022-12-18,12 Countries That Produce the Best Chocolate in the World,Insider Monkey,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/12-countries-produce-best-chocolate-193228814.html,1671305548,STORY,"['MDLZ', 'CHLSY', 'HSY']","[In this piece, we will take a look at the twelve countries that produce the best chocolate in the world. For more countries, head on over to 5 Countries That Produce the Best Chocolate in the World. Chocolate is one of the world's favorite foods. The sweet confectionery is a favorite among children and adults alike, so much so that global chocolate consumption stood at a whopping eight million tons last year. In terms of kilograms of chocolate consumption per person per year, Switzerland is at the top, with an average Swiss consuming 10 kilograms each year. Additionally, nine out of the top ten chocolate consuming nations are located in Europe, a fact that is also present when the list of the world's largest chocolate exporters is analyzed (as you will find out throughout this piece).However, just because they eat the most chocolate does not mean that the Europeans produce the most chocolate as well. Chocolate, in its purest form, is bitter and is made from the kernels of the cacao seed. This plant is found predominantly in Africa, and it is estimated that up to two thirds of the world's cacao seeds originate from the continent. Africa's large contribution of cocoa is simply due to the fact that the cacao tree can only grow in regions that are 20 degrees North or South of the equator. The use of this plant for food, for the earliest form of chocolate, makes it one of the oldest food products in the world as well, with some estimates suggesting that humans first started consuming the cacao plant in the 19th century BCE.With the progression of time, the industry has also evolved. As has been the case with corn, chocolate has also seen the use of gene editing technologies. These have enabled producers to study how the effects of global warming on Africa can be mitigated to ensure that the world keeps on getting its chocolate. One such example is the partnership between Mars and the University of California, Davis, which aims to take a look at DNA sequencing for plant breeding to improve Africa's orphan crops. Additionally, their direct collaboration will analyze methods to use CRISPR DNA sequencing to mutate the cacao plant and ensure that it can also survive in hotter climates. CRISPR is a proprietary technology of the Swiss firm CRISPR Therapeutics AG (NASDAQ:CRSP), and is used primarily in healthcare.Story continuesOther uses of technology in the chocolate industry mirror those in general crop production. Throughout the chocolate manufacturing process, ranging from processing, blending, conching, tempering, shaping, and storing, machines and connectivity are aiding workers. Intelligent factories enable machines to communicate with a central platform for data processing and analytics requirements, with roller refiners first used to break the crystals down and then refine them into fine powder. These systems are manufactured by companies such as Artisan Industrial in Australia, with processing plants increasingly starting to use rollers instead of sugar milling equipment for production. Another key player in the chocolate production equipment market is Buhler Industries Inc. (OTCMKTS:BIIAF). Moving towards the market as a whole, according to Fortune Business Insights, the global chocolate confectionery market was worth $114 billion in 2019 and will grow at a compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) of 2.3% until 2027 to be worth $136 billion by the end of the forecast period. The firm believes that growth in demand for specialty chocolates will drive the growth, while the associated health risks of obesity and diabetes will hamper it. Some well-known confectionery companies that manufacture and sell chocolates are Chocoladefabriken Lindt &amp; Sprüngli AG (SWX:LISN.SW), Mondelez International, Inc. (NASDAQ:MDLZ), and The Hershey Company (NYSE:HSY).Our Methodology:We used trade data to analyze which countries export the most chocolates. These are then analyzed in terms of their industry, its origins, and the key players that are often publicly traded companies as well.Countries That Produce the Best Chocolate in the World12. Republic of Türkiye Chocolate Exports in 2021: $688 millionThe Republic of Türkiye is a transcontinental country with a strong confectionery industry as well. Estimates suggest that this industry makes up to 2% of Turkey's food processing industry. Turkey sold 200,300 tons of chocolate in 2019, and the country's largest customers were Iraq, Saudi Arabia, and the United Arab Emirates. The industry is aiming to expand its sales and set a whopping $1.5 billion export target for 2021 according to a statement from the export union. However, Turkish chocolate exports in 2021, as listed by the Harmonized Tariff Schedule item '1806 Chocolate and other food preparations containing cocoa', stood at $688 million with an estimated 233,254 tons shipped. Turkey's largest chocolate company in terms of market capitalization is Kent Gida Maddeleri Sanayii ve Ticaret A.S. (IST:KENT), and other firms such as Ülker Bisküvi Sanayi A.S. (IST:ULKER) and Oylum Sinai Yatirimlar Anonim Sirketi (IST:OYLUM) also manufacture and sell chocolates.11. Swiss Confederation Chocolate Exports in 2021: $854 millionThe Swiss Confederation, or Switzerland, is a European nation that is one of the richest and most developed countries in the world. Swiss chocolate dates its way back to the 1700s when the country invented both condensed milk and then milk chocolate. In fact, Henry Nestle, the inventor of condensed milk, saw his company become the global food behemoth that is known today by his surname. Swiss companies are also known for operating their factories as museums which allow visitors to take a glimpse in their past. Given its history, it is no surprise that some of the most well-known chocolate companies are located in Switzerland. Perhaps the most renowned is Chocoladefabriken Lindt &amp; Sprüngli AG (SWX:LISN.SW), with others being Barry Callebaut AG (SWX:BARN) and Läderach.10. Russia Federation Chocolate Exports in 2021: $863 millionThe Russian Federation is a transcontinental country that has had a storied relationship with chocolate. Russian chocolate companies are some of the oldest in the world, as they trace their roots back to the 1800s. However, the country's experimentation with communism led to these factories being nationalized at one point in time, as chocolate was viewed as a food of the city dwellers instead of the farmer and working class. Still, Russia exported $863 million of chocolate last year, which weighed 324,334 tons. Russian chocolate manufacturers include A. Korkunov (a Mars subsidiary), OAO Konditerskiy Kontsern Babayevskiy Open Joint-Stock Company (the oldest Russian chocolate company set up in 1804), and Rot Front Open Joint-Stock Company. The latter two are subsidiaries of United Confectioners. Despite Russia's animosity with the West, Russian consumers love consuming chocolates made by Chocoladefabriken Lindt &amp; Sprüngli AG (SWX:LISN.SW), Mondelez International, Inc. (NASDAQ:MDLZ), and The Hershey Company (NYSE:HSY).9. United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland Chocolate Exports in 2021: $1 billionThe United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, simply known as the U.K. or Britain, is one of Europe's largest economies and a great power in global politics. It is also one of Europe's largest chocolate consumers, and its chocolate processing and grinding industry are among the largest on the continent. The British chocolate and confectionery market was valued at £3.4 billion in 2022, and it is expected to grow by 4.4%. Britain's Cadbury chocolate brand is one of the most famous in the world and is currently owned by the U.S. firm Mondelez International. Other British firms headquartered in the U.K. that make chocolates are Hotel Chocolat Group plc (LON:HOTC.L) and Real Good Food plc (LON:RGD.L).8. French Republic Chocolate Exports in 2021: $1.55 billionThe French Republic is another prosperous European nation and another great power. Chocolate in France dates back to the 17th century, when it was limited only to the nobility, royalty, or the bourgeois. The masses on the other hand were able to enjoy chocolate in the 19th century. The first French chocolate maker was a pharmaceutical firm that started to use it for its medicinal properties. Since then, the industry has expanded greatly, as evident by France's $1.55 billion of chocolate exports last year. Most French chocolate firms are privately held, and one of the largest companies is Cémoi.7. United States of America Chocolate Exports in 2021: $1.68 billionThe United States of America is a global superpower and a major exporting nation. American confectionery firms are among the largest players in the world, and those that are listed on the public stock market are worth billions of dollars. The largest publicly listed American chocolate company is Mondelez International, Inc. (NASDAQ:MDLZ) which has a market capitalization of a whopping $90 billion. America's second multi-billion dollar company is The Hershey Company (NYSE:HSY), and a private firm Mars, Incorporated is also known all over the world and has stakes in international subsidiaries.6. Canada Chocolate Exports in 2021: $1.77 billionCanada is a North American country rich in natural resources and with a strong economy that lets it rank among the list of world's First World countries. The Canadian chocolate market has grown by 2.8% on average between 2017 and 2022, and it is worth $2.7 billion in 2022. Canada's oldest chocolate company is Ganong Bros., Limited, which was set up in 1873. Its largest publicly traded confectionery firm is Rogers Sugar Inc. (TSE:RSI.TO) with a CAD$609 million market capitalization. Chocolates made by Chocoladefabriken Lindt &amp; Sprüngli AG (SWX:LISN.SW), Mondelez International, Inc. (NASDAQ:MDLZ), and The Hershey Company (NYSE:HSY) are also extremely famous in the country. Click to continue reading and see 5 Countries That Produce the Best Chocolate in the World.

Given that the market rewards strong financials in the long-term, we wonder if that is the case in this instance. Specifically, we decided to study Ulta Beauty's  ROE in this article.Return on Equity or ROE is a test of how effectively a company is growing its value and managing investors’ money. Put another way, it reveals the company's success at turning shareholder investments into profits. See our latest analysis for Ulta Beauty How Is ROE Calculated?ROE can be calculated by using the formula:Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' EquitySo, based on the above formula, the ROE for Ulta Beauty is:62% = US$1.2b ÷ US$1.9b (Based on the trailing twelve months to October 2022).The 'return' is the amount earned after tax over the last twelve months. One way to conceptualize this is that for each $1 of shareholders' capital it has, the company made $0.62 in profit.What Is The Relationship Between ROE And Earnings Growth?So far, we've learned that ROE is a measure of a company's profitability. Based on how much of its profits the company chooses to reinvest or ""retain"", we are then able to evaluate a company's future ability to generate profits. Assuming all else is equal, companies that have both a higher return on equity and higher profit retention are usually the ones that have a higher growth rate when compared to companies that don't have the same features.A Side By Side comparison of Ulta Beauty's Earnings Growth And 62% ROEFirstly, we acknowledge that Ulta Beauty has a significantly high ROE. Secondly, even when compared to the industry average of 29% the company's ROE is quite impressive. This likely paved the way for the modest 13% net income growth seen by Ulta Beauty over the past five years. growthNext, on comparing with the industry net income growth, we found that Ulta Beauty's reported growth was lower than the industry growth of 35% in the same period, which is not something we like to see.Story continuespast-earnings-growthThe basis for attaching value to a company is, to a great extent, tied to its earnings growth. It’s important for an investor to know whether the market has priced in the company's expected earnings growth (or decline). This then helps them determine if the stock is placed for a bright or bleak future. Is ULTA fairly valued? This infographic on the company's intrinsic value  has everything you need to know.Is Ulta Beauty Using Its Retained Earnings Effectively?Ulta Beauty doesn't pay any dividend currently which essentially means that it has been reinvesting all of its profits into the business. This definitely contributes to the decent earnings growth number that we discussed above.ConclusionOverall, we are quite pleased with Ulta Beauty's performance. In particular, it's great to see that the company is investing heavily into its business and along with a high rate of return, that has resulted in a respectable growth in its earnings. With that said, the latest industry analyst forecasts reveal that the company's earnings growth is expected to slow down.

If you want to see more stocks in this selection, check out Jim Cramer's 5 Favorite Dividend Aristocrats. Jim Cramer, the host of Mad Money on CNBC and an anchor on Squawk on the Street, is one of the most followed television personalities commenting on Wall Street equities. At the end of August this year, Cramer put out a list of his 10 favorite “dividend aristocrats” to buy and hold throughout 2022, noting that their dividend payouts provide a safe haven against Federal Reserve policies and consequent market declines. Cramer observed that dividend aristocrats, which are members of the S&amp;P 500 Index with a history of increasing dividends consistently for at least 25 years, have fared better than the broader U.S. stock index. On December 16, Cramer attempted to address the primary investor concern regarding the United States slipping into a recession in the coming year. He told his viewers on Mad Money: “We want the Fed to talk a big game, without needing to actually do too much. Talk is better than action. We want [Fed Chair Jerome Powell] to scare the economy into slowing under its own weight. We don’t want endless rate hikes ... that will destroy everything in its path.”Jim Cramer made these comments in light of the Fed raising interest rates by half a percentage point to their highest levels in 15 years on December 14. The S&amp;P 500 was also down 5.6% in December, continuing its losing streak for weeks. In this market environment, some of the dividend aristocrats favored by Jim Cramer for 2022 include The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO), Caterpillar Inc. (NYSE:CAT), and McDonald's Corporation (NYSE:MCD). Our MethodologyWe explored the 10 dividend aristocrats that Jim Cramer listed as his favorites on an August 30 segment of CNBC’s Mad Money. We have also mentioned the comments he made about these stocks after August 30, to see whether he stands by his original bullish thesis for all these names. We have assessed the hedge fund sentiment from Insider Monkey’s database of 920 elite hedge funds tracked as of the end of the third quarter of 2022. The list is arranged according to the number of hedge fund holders in each firm. Story continuesJim Cramer's Favorite Dividend AristocratsJim Cramer's Favorite Dividend Aristocrats10. Federal Realty Investment Trust (NYSE:FRT)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 24Dividend Yield as of December 16: 4.13%Federal Realty Investment Trust (NYSE:FRT) is a leader in the ownership and operation of high quality retail properties located in primary coastal markets ranging from Washington to Boston, as well as San Francisco and Los Angeles. Federal Realty Investment Trust (NYSE:FRT) aims to distribute long-term, sustainable growth through investing in areas where retail demand outpaces supply. CNBC’s Jim Cramer said in an episode of Mad Money on August 30 that the REIT yields about 4.2% and owns huge suburban retail properties. The reason Federal Realty Investment Trust (NYSE:FRT) featured as one of Cramer’s favorite dividend aristocrats was because the kind of properties it owns and leases remain resilient despite economic weakness. On September 14, Jim Cramer reiterated his support for Federal Realty Investment Trust (NYSE:FRT), saying:“While most retail stocks are horrible right now … the companies that own the best retail real estate are doing just fine.” On November 3, Federal Realty Investment Trust (NYSE:FRT) reported a Q3 FFO of $1.59 and a revenue of $273.45 million, outperforming Wall Street estimates by $0.06 and $12.29 million, respectively. The company raised its full-year 2022 earnings per diluted share guidance to $3.88-$3.93 and increased full-year FFO per diluted share guidance to $6.27 - $6.32 from the prior outlook of $6.10-$6.25 and a $6.21 consensus. According to Insider Monkey’s data, 24 hedge funds reported owning stakes worth $132 million in Federal Realty Investment Trust (NYSE:FRT) at the end of Q3 2022, compared to the same number of funds in the prior quarter worth $200 million. Like The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO), Caterpillar Inc. (NYSE:CAT), and McDonald's Corporation (NYSE:MCD), Federal Realty Investment Trust (NYSE:FRT) is one of the dividend aristocrats backed by Jim Cramer. 9. Realty Income Corporation (NYSE:O)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 28Dividend Yield as of December 16: 4.61%Realty Income Corporation (NYSE:O) is an S&amp;P 500 company that seeks to deliver shareholders with dependable monthly income. It is a California-based company that invests in free-standing, single-tenant commercial properties in the United States, Spain, and the United Kingdom which are subject to NNN Leases. Cramer noted on an August 30 Mad Money segment that:“The stock’s been punished lately because most retail has been struggling.”He observed that Realty Income Corporation (NYSE:O) has “tons of consistent clients” like drugstores, supermarkets, dollar stores, and convenience stores. He further added: “Best of all, Realty Income pays you a monthly dividend that yields 4.3% here.”Supporting Realty Income Corporation (NYSE:O) further, he said on a September 14 segment of Mad Money:“As long as their tenants stay in business, they won’t take much of a hit financially. To me, that looks like an opportunity.”On December 13, Realty Income Corporation (NYSE:O) declared a $0.2485 per share monthly dividend, a 0.2% increase from its prior dividend of $0.248. The dividend is payable on January 13, 2023 to shareholders of record on January 3. The forward yield was 4.60%. The firm has a history of increasing dividend payouts for 28 consecutive years. According to Insider Monkey’s data, Realty Income Corporation (NYSE:O) was part of 28 hedge fund portfolios at the end of Q3 2022, up from 19 in the prior quarter. Stuart J. Zimmer’s Zimmer Partners is the largest position holder in the company, with 2.90 million shares worth $169 million. 8. Hormel Foods Corporation (NYSE:HRL)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 29Dividend Yield as of December 16: 2.41%Hormel Foods Corporation (NYSE:HRL) was founded in 1891 and is headquartered in Austin, Minnesota. The company develops, processes, and distributes meat, nuts, and food products to retail, foodservice, deli, and commercial customers in the United States and internationally. The company operates through four segments – Grocery Products, Refrigerated Foods, Jennie-O Turkey Store, and International &amp; Other. Jim Cramer said on his Mad Money segment on August 30 that Hormel Foods Corporation (NYSE:HRL) is a classic defensive name, noting that as inflation crushed consumers, Hormel could be “a good trade-down play.”On December 1, Cramer was in conversation with Hormel Foods Corporation (NYSE:HRL)’s CEO, discussing the company's negative Q4 organic volume growth and the recent dividend increase. The CEO reassured Cramer that the company is dedicated to protecting and increasing its dividend payouts, which may not look huge, but it has consistently increased payouts for the last 57 years. Hormel also has a fortress balance sheet and the negative growth is easily compensated by the strong cash position and dividend growth. Hormel Foods Corporation (NYSE:HRL) still remains one of Cramer’s favorite dividend aristocrats. Hormel Foods Corporation (NYSE:HRL) on November 21 declared a quarterly dividend of $0.275 per share, a 5.8% increase from its prior dividend of $0.26. The dividend is distributable on February 15, 2023 to shareholders of record on January 17. According to Insider Monkey’s data, 29 funds reported owning stakes worth $455.8 million in Hormel Foods Corporation (NYSE:HRL) at the end of September 2022, compared to 27 funds in the earlier quarter worth $434.5 million. Jim Simons’ Renaissance Technologies is the leading position holder in the company, with 2.3 million shares worth $106.3 million. Here is what LRT Capital Management has to say about Hormel Foods Corporation (NYSE:HRL) in its Q3 2021 investor letter:“Hormel Foods Corporation (HRL) – the maker of SPAM and Applegate Turkey (among many other products), is down over 20% since peaking last year, largely on fears of higher cost. We expect the company will be able to raise prices to offset cost inflation as they have always been able to win their past.”7. General Dynamics Corporation (NYSE:GD)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 35Dividend Yield as of December 16: 2.06%General Dynamics Corporation (NYSE:GD) was founded in 1899 and is headquartered in Reston, Virginia. It operates as an aerospace and defense company worldwide, and it has four segments – Aerospace, Marine Systems, Combat Systems, and Technologies. On Mad Money’s August-end segment, Jim Cramer said that he is optimistic about the defense industry overall, but General Dynamics Corporation (NYSE:GD) is the only dividend aristocrat in the sector. He told viewers: “Unfortunately, they also have a business jet division that will no doubt get hit if we have a nasty recession, but that hasn’t stopped the stock from rallying 11% this year, aided by a very hands-on management that knows what’s needed in a less secure world.”Cramer also backed General Dynamics Corporation (NYSE:GD) in a May 2020 segment of Mad Money, saying: “You have to take a long view on GD ’cause it’s not the favorite one right now. It’s not the loved one and the whole group is a little under pressure, but I think General Dynamics is a very good long-term hold.”On December 7, General Dynamics Corporation (NYSE:GD) declared a $1.26 per share quarterly dividend, in line with previous. The dividend is payable on February 10, 2023 to shareholders of record on January 20. The quarterly dividend was increased by 6% in 2022 to stretch General Dynamics’ dividend hike streak to 26 years. According to Insider Monkey’s data, General Dynamics Corporation (NYSE:GD) was part of 35 hedge fund portfolios at the end of September 2022, compared to 42 in the prior quarter. James A. Star’s Longview Asset Management is the leading position holder in the company, with 30 million shares worth $6.4 billion. Here is what Oakmark Global Fund has to say about General Dynamics Corporation (NYSE:GD) in their Q1 2021 investor letter:“The second new U.S. equity purchase was General Dynamics, a leading U.S. defense contractor and owner of the world’s premier business jet franchise (Gulfstream). We were able to purchase this high-quality and durable business at a meaningful discount to our estimate of its intrinsic value after a series of near-term concerns hurt its share price. Taking a longer term view, the company’s business jet franchise should benefit from a multi-year investment program in new, differentiated products. Also, its free cash flow conversion is set to improve materially and the company is poised to benefit from a highly visible ramp up in revenue related to next generation nuclear-powered submarines. As these positives come into clearer view, we expect sentiment to improve, along with the company’s share price.”6. Archer-Daniels-Midland Company (NYSE:ADM)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 37Dividend Yield as of December 16: 1.73%Archer-Daniels-Midland Company (NYSE:ADM) procures, transports, processes, and merchandises agricultural commodities in the United States, Switzerland, Cayman Islands, Brazil, Mexico, the United Kingdom, and internationally. The company operates through three segments – Ag Services and Oilseeds, Carbohydrate Solutions, and Nutrition. Jim Cramer told viewers on August 30 that he likes Archer-Daniels-Midland Company (NYSE:ADM) and the potential upside from supply chain disruptions. He also said that the stock has started to rebound from its mid-July bottom, driven by a recovery in crop prices. He called it a “conservative, decent stock.”Jim Cramer reinforced his prior Archer-Daniels-Midland Company (NYSE:ADM) thesis on a December 14 segment of Mad Money, saying that the stock is the best performer in consumer staples space so far this year, and is a winner as long as the Russia-Ukraine war continues. He categorized it as one of the top five consumer staple stocks for 2023.According to Insider Monkey’s Q3 data, 37 hedge funds were long Archer-Daniels-Midland Company (NYSE:ADM), compared to 42 funds in the earlier quarter. Tom Gayner’s Markel Gayner Asset Management is the leading position holder in the company, with nearly 1.5 million shares worth $117.7 million. In addition to The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO), Caterpillar Inc. (NYSE:CAT), and McDonald's Corporation (NYSE:MCD), Archer-Daniels-Midland Company (NYSE:ADM) is one of the favorite dividend aristocrats of Jim Cramer. Here is what Diamond Hill Long-Short Fund has to say about Archer-Daniels-Midland Company (NYSE:ADM) in its Q1 2022 investor letter:“ADM is a leading agricultural processor that also operates a global nutrition business focused on the development of ingredients and flavors for food and beverages, supplements and more. The company’s recent operating results have benefited (unfortunately) from the war in Ukraine as grain prices and agricultural markets globally experienced strong price increases. ADM is positioned well to benefit from the volatility due to its stable North American agricultural base.” Click to continue reading and see Jim Cramer's 5 Favorite Dividend Aristocrats.  Suggested articles:15 Biggest Endowments in the US10 Best Tobacco Stocks To Buy12 Dividend Stocks That Outperform S&amp;P 500 Disclosure: None.

And the truth is, you can make significant gains if you buy good quality businesses at the right price. For example, long term Stryker Corporation (NYSE:SYK) shareholders have enjoyed a 56% share price rise over the last half decade, well in excess of the market return of around 37% (not including dividends).So let's assess the underlying fundamentals over the last 5 years and see if they've moved in lock-step with shareholder returns. Check out our latest analysis for Stryker To paraphrase Benjamin Graham: Over the short term the market is a voting machine, but over the long term it's a weighing machine. By comparing earnings per share (EPS) and share price changes over time, we can get a feel for how investor attitudes to a company have morphed over time.During five years of share price growth, Stryker achieved compound earnings per share (EPS) growth of 6.4% per year. This EPS growth is lower than the 9% average annual increase in the share price. This suggests that market participants hold the company in higher regard, these days. That's not necessarily surprising considering the five-year track record of earnings growth.The graphic below depicts how EPS has changed over time (unveil the exact values by clicking on the image).earnings-per-share-growthWe know that Stryker has improved its bottom line lately, but is it going to grow revenue? This free report showing analyst revenue forecasts should help you figure out if the EPS growth can be sustained.What About Dividends?It is important to consider the total shareholder return, as well as the share price return, for any given stock. Whereas the share price return only reflects the change in the share price, the TSR includes the value of dividends (assuming they were reinvested) and the benefit of any discounted capital raising or spin-off. So for companies that pay a generous dividend, the TSR is often a lot higher than the share price return. As it happens, Stryker's TSR for the last 5 years was 65%, which exceeds the share price return mentioned earlier. And there's no prize for guessing that the dividend payments largely explain the divergence!Story continuesA Different PerspectiveAlthough it hurts that Stryker returned a loss of 3.4% in the last twelve months, the broader market was actually worse, returning a loss of 19%. Of course, the long term returns are far more important and the good news is that over five years, the stock has returned 10% for each year. In the best case scenario the last year is just a temporary blip on the journey to a brighter future. It's always interesting to track share price performance over the longer term.

110,7673f30f-6717-3e77-b399-b71f6dac8595,PGR,2022-12-18,Is The Market Rewarding The Progressive Corporation (NYSE:PGR) With A Negative Sentiment As A Result Of Its Mixed Fundamentals?,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/market-rewarding-progressive-corporation-nyse-120100218.html,1671364860,STORY,['PGR'],"[It is hard to get excited after looking at Progressive's (NYSE:PGR) recent performance, when its stock has declined 2.3% over the past week. We, however decided to study the company's financials to determine if they have got anything to do with the price decline. Long-term fundamentals are usually what drive market outcomes, so it's worth paying close attention. Specifically, we decided to study Progressive's  ROE in this article.Return on equity or ROE is an important factor to be considered by a shareholder because it tells them how effectively their capital is being reinvested. In simpler terms, it measures the profitability of a company in relation to shareholder's equity. Check out our latest analysis for Progressive How Is ROE Calculated?The formula for ROE is:Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' EquitySo, based on the above formula, the ROE for Progressive is:5.8% = US$857m ÷ US$15b (Based on the trailing twelve months to September 2022).The 'return' refers to a company's earnings over the last year. So, this means that for every $1 of its shareholder's investments, the company generates a profit of $0.06.What Has ROE Got To Do With Earnings Growth?We have already established that ROE serves as an efficient profit-generating gauge for a company's future earnings. Based on how much of its profits the company chooses to reinvest or ""retain"", we are then able to evaluate a company's future ability to generate profits. Generally speaking, other things being equal, firms with a high return on equity and profit retention, have a higher growth rate than firms that don’t share these attributes.Progressive's Earnings Growth And 5.8% ROEWhen you first look at it, Progressive's ROE doesn't look that attractive. We then compared the company's ROE to the broader industry and were disappointed to see that the ROE is lower than the industry average of 13%. Progressive was still able to see a decent net income growth of 7.1% over the past five years. We reckon that there could be other factors at play here. For example, it is possible that the company's management has made some good strategic decisions, or that the company has a low payout ratio.Story continuesAs a next step, we compared Progressive's net income growth with the industry and were disappointed to see that the company's growth is lower than the industry average growth of 13% in the same period.past-earnings-growthEarnings growth is a huge factor in stock valuation. It’s important for an investor to know whether the market has priced in the company's expected earnings growth (or decline). This then helps them determine if the stock is placed for a bright or bleak future. Has the market priced in the future outlook for PGR? You can find out in our latest intrinsic value infographic research report. Is Progressive Efficiently Re-investing Its Profits?The high three-year median payout ratio of 50% (or a retention ratio of 50%) for Progressive suggests that the company's growth wasn't really hampered despite it returning most of its income to its shareholders.Besides, Progressive has been paying dividends for at least ten years or more. This shows that the company is committed to sharing profits with its shareholders. Our latest analyst data shows that the future payout ratio of the company is expected to drop to 37% over the next three years. The fact that the company's ROE is expected to rise to 23% over the same period is explained by the drop in the payout ratio.SummaryIn total, we're a bit ambivalent about Progressive's performance. While no doubt its earnings growth is pretty respectable, the low profit retention could mean that the company's earnings growth could have been higher, had it been paying reinvesting a higher portion of its profits. An improvement in its ROE could also help future earnings growth. That being so, the latest analyst forecasts show that the company will continue to see an expansion in its earnings. Are these analysts expectations based on the broad expectations for the industry, or on the company's fundamentals?

(NYSE:EL) insiders offloaded a considerable amount of shares over the past year could have raised some eyebrows amongst investors. Knowing whether insiders are buying is usually more helpful when evaluating insider transactions, as insider selling can have various explanations. However, shareholders should take a deeper look if several insiders are selling stock over a specific time period.Although we don't think shareholders should simply follow insider transactions, we would consider it foolish to ignore insider transactions altogether. View our latest analysis for Estée Lauder Companies Estée Lauder Companies Insider Transactions Over The Last YearIn the last twelve months, the biggest single sale by an insider was when the President, Fabrizio Freda, sold US$11m worth of shares at a price of US$268 per share. We generally don't like to see insider selling, but the lower the sale price, the more it concerns us. The silver lining is that this sell-down took place above the latest price (US$241). So it may not shed much light on insider confidence at current levels.Insiders in Estée Lauder Companies didn't buy any shares in the last year.

A high insider ownership often makes company leadership more mindful of shareholder interests. Estée Lauder Companies insiders own 13% of the company, currently worth about US$11b based on the recent share price. This kind of significant ownership by insiders does generally increase the chance that the company is run in the interest of all shareholders.Story continuesSo What Do The Estée Lauder Companies Insider Transactions Indicate?The fact that there have been no Estée Lauder Companies insider transactions recently certainly doesn't bother us. It's great to see high levels of insider ownership, but looking back over the last year, we don't gain confidence from the Estée Lauder Companies insiders selling.

If you want to see more stocks in this selection, check out Jim Cramer's 5 Favorite Dividend Aristocrats. Jim Cramer, the host of Mad Money on CNBC and an anchor on Squawk on the Street, is one of the most followed television personalities commenting on Wall Street equities. At the end of August this year, Cramer put out a list of his 10 favorite “dividend aristocrats” to buy and hold throughout 2022, noting that their dividend payouts provide a safe haven against Federal Reserve policies and consequent market declines. Cramer observed that dividend aristocrats, which are members of the S&amp;P 500 Index with a history of increasing dividends consistently for at least 25 years, have fared better than the broader U.S. stock index. On December 16, Cramer attempted to address the primary investor concern regarding the United States slipping into a recession in the coming year. He told his viewers on Mad Money: “We want the Fed to talk a big game, without needing to actually do too much. Talk is better than action. We want [Fed Chair Jerome Powell] to scare the economy into slowing under its own weight. We don’t want endless rate hikes ... that will destroy everything in its path.”Jim Cramer made these comments in light of the Fed raising interest rates by half a percentage point to their highest levels in 15 years on December 14. The S&amp;P 500 was also down 5.6% in December, continuing its losing streak for weeks. In this market environment, some of the dividend aristocrats favored by Jim Cramer for 2022 include The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO), Caterpillar Inc. (NYSE:CAT), and McDonald's Corporation (NYSE:MCD). Our MethodologyWe explored the 10 dividend aristocrats that Jim Cramer listed as his favorites on an August 30 segment of CNBC’s Mad Money. We have also mentioned the comments he made about these stocks after August 30, to see whether he stands by his original bullish thesis for all these names. We have assessed the hedge fund sentiment from Insider Monkey’s database of 920 elite hedge funds tracked as of the end of the third quarter of 2022. The list is arranged according to the number of hedge fund holders in each firm. Story continuesJim Cramer's Favorite Dividend AristocratsJim Cramer's Favorite Dividend Aristocrats10. Federal Realty Investment Trust (NYSE:FRT)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 24Dividend Yield as of December 16: 4.13%Federal Realty Investment Trust (NYSE:FRT) is a leader in the ownership and operation of high quality retail properties located in primary coastal markets ranging from Washington to Boston, as well as San Francisco and Los Angeles. Federal Realty Investment Trust (NYSE:FRT) aims to distribute long-term, sustainable growth through investing in areas where retail demand outpaces supply. CNBC’s Jim Cramer said in an episode of Mad Money on August 30 that the REIT yields about 4.2% and owns huge suburban retail properties. The reason Federal Realty Investment Trust (NYSE:FRT) featured as one of Cramer’s favorite dividend aristocrats was because the kind of properties it owns and leases remain resilient despite economic weakness. On September 14, Jim Cramer reiterated his support for Federal Realty Investment Trust (NYSE:FRT), saying:“While most retail stocks are horrible right now … the companies that own the best retail real estate are doing just fine.” On November 3, Federal Realty Investment Trust (NYSE:FRT) reported a Q3 FFO of $1.59 and a revenue of $273.45 million, outperforming Wall Street estimates by $0.06 and $12.29 million, respectively. The company raised its full-year 2022 earnings per diluted share guidance to $3.88-$3.93 and increased full-year FFO per diluted share guidance to $6.27 - $6.32 from the prior outlook of $6.10-$6.25 and a $6.21 consensus. According to Insider Monkey’s data, 24 hedge funds reported owning stakes worth $132 million in Federal Realty Investment Trust (NYSE:FRT) at the end of Q3 2022, compared to the same number of funds in the prior quarter worth $200 million. Like The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO), Caterpillar Inc. (NYSE:CAT), and McDonald's Corporation (NYSE:MCD), Federal Realty Investment Trust (NYSE:FRT) is one of the dividend aristocrats backed by Jim Cramer. 9. Realty Income Corporation (NYSE:O)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 28Dividend Yield as of December 16: 4.61%Realty Income Corporation (NYSE:O) is an S&amp;P 500 company that seeks to deliver shareholders with dependable monthly income. It is a California-based company that invests in free-standing, single-tenant commercial properties in the United States, Spain, and the United Kingdom which are subject to NNN Leases. Cramer noted on an August 30 Mad Money segment that:“The stock’s been punished lately because most retail has been struggling.”He observed that Realty Income Corporation (NYSE:O) has “tons of consistent clients” like drugstores, supermarkets, dollar stores, and convenience stores. He further added: “Best of all, Realty Income pays you a monthly dividend that yields 4.3% here.”Supporting Realty Income Corporation (NYSE:O) further, he said on a September 14 segment of Mad Money:“As long as their tenants stay in business, they won’t take much of a hit financially. To me, that looks like an opportunity.”On December 13, Realty Income Corporation (NYSE:O) declared a $0.2485 per share monthly dividend, a 0.2% increase from its prior dividend of $0.248. The dividend is payable on January 13, 2023 to shareholders of record on January 3. The forward yield was 4.60%. The firm has a history of increasing dividend payouts for 28 consecutive years. According to Insider Monkey’s data, Realty Income Corporation (NYSE:O) was part of 28 hedge fund portfolios at the end of Q3 2022, up from 19 in the prior quarter. Stuart J. Zimmer’s Zimmer Partners is the largest position holder in the company, with 2.90 million shares worth $169 million. 8. Hormel Foods Corporation (NYSE:HRL)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 29Dividend Yield as of December 16: 2.41%Hormel Foods Corporation (NYSE:HRL) was founded in 1891 and is headquartered in Austin, Minnesota. The company develops, processes, and distributes meat, nuts, and food products to retail, foodservice, deli, and commercial customers in the United States and internationally. The company operates through four segments – Grocery Products, Refrigerated Foods, Jennie-O Turkey Store, and International &amp; Other. Jim Cramer said on his Mad Money segment on August 30 that Hormel Foods Corporation (NYSE:HRL) is a classic defensive name, noting that as inflation crushed consumers, Hormel could be “a good trade-down play.”On December 1, Cramer was in conversation with Hormel Foods Corporation (NYSE:HRL)’s CEO, discussing the company's negative Q4 organic volume growth and the recent dividend increase. The CEO reassured Cramer that the company is dedicated to protecting and increasing its dividend payouts, which may not look huge, but it has consistently increased payouts for the last 57 years. Hormel also has a fortress balance sheet and the negative growth is easily compensated by the strong cash position and dividend growth. Hormel Foods Corporation (NYSE:HRL) still remains one of Cramer’s favorite dividend aristocrats. Hormel Foods Corporation (NYSE:HRL) on November 21 declared a quarterly dividend of $0.275 per share, a 5.8% increase from its prior dividend of $0.26. The dividend is distributable on February 15, 2023 to shareholders of record on January 17. According to Insider Monkey’s data, 29 funds reported owning stakes worth $455.8 million in Hormel Foods Corporation (NYSE:HRL) at the end of September 2022, compared to 27 funds in the earlier quarter worth $434.5 million. Jim Simons’ Renaissance Technologies is the leading position holder in the company, with 2.3 million shares worth $106.3 million. Here is what LRT Capital Management has to say about Hormel Foods Corporation (NYSE:HRL) in its Q3 2021 investor letter:“Hormel Foods Corporation (HRL) – the maker of SPAM and Applegate Turkey (among many other products), is down over 20% since peaking last year, largely on fears of higher cost. We expect the company will be able to raise prices to offset cost inflation as they have always been able to win their past.”7. General Dynamics Corporation (NYSE:GD)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 35Dividend Yield as of December 16: 2.06%General Dynamics Corporation (NYSE:GD) was founded in 1899 and is headquartered in Reston, Virginia. It operates as an aerospace and defense company worldwide, and it has four segments – Aerospace, Marine Systems, Combat Systems, and Technologies. On Mad Money’s August-end segment, Jim Cramer said that he is optimistic about the defense industry overall, but General Dynamics Corporation (NYSE:GD) is the only dividend aristocrat in the sector. He told viewers: “Unfortunately, they also have a business jet division that will no doubt get hit if we have a nasty recession, but that hasn’t stopped the stock from rallying 11% this year, aided by a very hands-on management that knows what’s needed in a less secure world.”Cramer also backed General Dynamics Corporation (NYSE:GD) in a May 2020 segment of Mad Money, saying: “You have to take a long view on GD ’cause it’s not the favorite one right now. It’s not the loved one and the whole group is a little under pressure, but I think General Dynamics is a very good long-term hold.”On December 7, General Dynamics Corporation (NYSE:GD) declared a $1.26 per share quarterly dividend, in line with previous. The dividend is payable on February 10, 2023 to shareholders of record on January 20. The quarterly dividend was increased by 6% in 2022 to stretch General Dynamics’ dividend hike streak to 26 years. According to Insider Monkey’s data, General Dynamics Corporation (NYSE:GD) was part of 35 hedge fund portfolios at the end of September 2022, compared to 42 in the prior quarter. James A. Star’s Longview Asset Management is the leading position holder in the company, with 30 million shares worth $6.4 billion. Here is what Oakmark Global Fund has to say about General Dynamics Corporation (NYSE:GD) in their Q1 2021 investor letter:“The second new U.S. equity purchase was General Dynamics, a leading U.S. defense contractor and owner of the world’s premier business jet franchise (Gulfstream). We were able to purchase this high-quality and durable business at a meaningful discount to our estimate of its intrinsic value after a series of near-term concerns hurt its share price. Taking a longer term view, the company’s business jet franchise should benefit from a multi-year investment program in new, differentiated products. Also, its free cash flow conversion is set to improve materially and the company is poised to benefit from a highly visible ramp up in revenue related to next generation nuclear-powered submarines. As these positives come into clearer view, we expect sentiment to improve, along with the company’s share price.”6. Archer-Daniels-Midland Company (NYSE:ADM)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 37Dividend Yield as of December 16: 1.73%Archer-Daniels-Midland Company (NYSE:ADM) procures, transports, processes, and merchandises agricultural commodities in the United States, Switzerland, Cayman Islands, Brazil, Mexico, the United Kingdom, and internationally. The company operates through three segments – Ag Services and Oilseeds, Carbohydrate Solutions, and Nutrition. Jim Cramer told viewers on August 30 that he likes Archer-Daniels-Midland Company (NYSE:ADM) and the potential upside from supply chain disruptions. He also said that the stock has started to rebound from its mid-July bottom, driven by a recovery in crop prices. He called it a “conservative, decent stock.”Jim Cramer reinforced his prior Archer-Daniels-Midland Company (NYSE:ADM) thesis on a December 14 segment of Mad Money, saying that the stock is the best performer in consumer staples space so far this year, and is a winner as long as the Russia-Ukraine war continues.
