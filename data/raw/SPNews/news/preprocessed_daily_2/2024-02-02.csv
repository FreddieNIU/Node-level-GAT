If you wish to skip our detailed analysis on unveiling the social security conundrum, you may go to 10 Countries Where You Can Retire on Just Social Security in 2024. ', '2024 is here, and it looks like it isn’t the retirement fiesta that social security beneficiaries were hoping it to be. The hefty Cost of Living Adjustments (COLAs) from 2022 and 2023 are finally taking a snooze, leaving retirees with a meager 3.2% adjustment for this year. This means that, on average, recipients are witnessing an increase of $54 only. BlackRock, Inc. (NYSE:BLK) notes that even though this COLA largely seems ""underwhelming"", it is still higher than the average increase of 2.5% in the 30 past years. Moreover, since the COLA is tied to the Bureau of Labor Statistics Consumer Price Index and consumer prices have eased, the smaller adjustment seems rather justified. So, the question lingering in the air is this: if inflation is tapering off and retirees have a bit more to splurge, why isn\'t that extra cash translating into a noticeable ease on their pockets?', 'According to the Senior Citizens League, most of the items seniors spend their money on seem to be consistently outpacing COLAs. Healthcare appears to be the biggest concern for retirees, eating away a significant chunk, if not all of their retirement incomes. The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS), for example, has raised the standard monthly premium for Medicare Part B enrollees to $174.70 this year, an increase of 6% from 2023. Moreover, deductibles for Medicare Part B beneficiaries have risen to $240 in 2024 from $226 in 2023. Due to the higher Medicare Part B premiums, many retirees may not be getting their full COLA as they are automatically deducted from their social security checks.', 'While this may be true for seniors relying on their social security checks, Rob Williams from The Charles Schwab Corporation (NYSE:SCHW) believes that this permanent COLA increase may help the average retiree capitalize on some gains.', '""Social Security benefits generally do keep up with inflation, though there is a lag… At the same time, the average retiree\'s expenses generally shrink over time, which can complement those higher benefits.”', '-Rob Williams, managing director for financial planning, retirement income, and wealth management at the The Charles Schwab Corporation (NYSE:SCHW) Center for Financial Research.', 'Though we might not entirely buy into the idea of expenses shrinking with age, given that growing older often brings a host of health concerns, the possibility of increased benefits may not be entirely unfounded. So how exactly will the COLA help the average retiree in the long run? Well, according to The Charles Schwab Corporation (NYSE:SCHW), if inflation rates continue to ease in the coming months, retirees will get to keep the higher benefits.', 'Nevertheless, solely relying on Social Security in retirement is no easy feat, which is why individuals must start saving for this period of their lives early on. There are many strategies that individuals can adopt to save for retirement. As such, employers play an active role in determining how much an individual can save for their future. According to research by asset manager BlackRock, Inc. (NYSE:BLK) and 401(k) provider Human Interest, individuals who have access to automated, employer-based retirement savings tools contribute an average of 7.4% of their salaries. This is in stark contrast to workers who don’t have such tools and contribute a meager 0.9% annually. The study by BlackRock, Inc. (NYSE:BLK) further discloses that the average worker using their employer’s retirement plan will have accumulated $710,900 for their retirement as opposed to their counterparts with no plans, resulting in a saving of $86,500 only. Similarly, employer matches also help significantly raise the amount of money being accumulated in a retirement savings account, something individuals with no employer plans are deprived of.', 'For many of these retirees who were deprived of employer retirement accounts, and yet many others who have simply failed to save for such an important phase of their lives, living on social security income is their only hope. According to the Social Security Administration (SSA), the average monthly retirement benefit is $1,781.63, not a huge sum for someone in the USA. According to the Motley Fool, the average cost of living in the USA is $2,317, creating a noticeable $536 gap that can pose a significant challenge for seniors trying to make ends meet each month. On the other hand, there are many places to retire on $1,000 a month outside the USA, an option many potential retirees are considering for their golden years.', 'To compile the list of countries where you can retire on just social security in 2024, we have used our previous lists of best places to retire around the world, the cheapest and safest countries to retire to, and the cheapest English-speaking countries to retire to. Next, we filtered out the countries that had a cost of living higher than the average social security check, i.e.: $1,781 (rounded off to $1,800). Countries were subsequently ranked in descending order based on their cost of living, arranging them from the highest to the lowest expenses. Please note that the cost of living figures can vary based on individual lifestyles and choices, and the provided values are averages. These figures have been taken from numerous sources such as International Living, Insider Monkey, and Expat Exchange, to name a few.', 'By the way, Insider Monkey is an investing website that tracks the movements of corporate insiders and hedge funds.

The company reported earnings per share (EPS) of $1.49 for the final months of 2023. That beat Wall Street’s consensus estimate of $1.47. Revenue in the final quarter of last year came in at $4.08 billion, which was only slightly below forecasts of $4.12 billion.

The appendix of today’s presentation includes supplemental information and disclosures, along with a reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures. So with that, let’s turn the call over to Leon.', 'Leon Topalian: Thanks, Jack and welcome everyone. I’d like to begin by congratulating our 32,000 Nucor teammates for delivering another strong year of financial results. We closed out 2023 with solid performance earning $3.16 per share in the fourth quarter on our way to $18 per share for the full year. This represents the third most profitable year in Nucor’s history behind 2022 and 2021. In fact, Nucor’s combined net earnings over the past 3 years, exceeds the combined net earnings of the last 20 years. This is a testament to the focus and dedication of our team as we execute our strategy to grow the core, expand beyond and live our culture. In keeping with our commitment to shareholders and our balanced approach toward capital allocation, Nucor invested $2.2 billion in CapEx and returned $2.1 billion to shareholders in 2023, representing 46% of our net earnings.', 'We are coming off the 3 best years in Nucor’s history, but in spite of that, we are even more excited about what lies ahead. The U.S. economy continues to be resilient and steel-intensive megatrends are starting to drive increased demand for the products we make and our focus on expand beyond businesses downstream are generating excellent returns. Turning to our safety performance, 2023 statistically was the safest year in Nucor’s history making 5 straight years of improvement. We also had 29 divisions going the entire year without a recordable injury. We finished the year with a company-wide injury and illness rate of 0.79, which is 17% lower than 2022 and well below the steel industry average. However, with that said, Nucor will not internally acknowledge 2023 as a record year in safety, will not celebrate 2023 as a record year, because on November 3, we lost a Nucor team member to a workplace accident.', 'Subsequently, on November 9, we had a company-wide safety stand down. It was a chance to honor our fallen team member and his family, reflect on our most important value, safety and reinforce that the health, safety and well-being of every Nucor team member is what matters most. Our team members come to work each and everyday to support themselves, their loved ones and they must go home each and everyday. That is our greatest responsibility to all 32,000 team members who make up our Nucor family. Every leader inside of Nucor is committed to delivering our mission to become the world’s safest steel company and there is no doubt in my mind, we will achieve our goals together. Nucor is the largest and most diversified steel producer in North America.', 'We pioneered the commercial application of EAF steelmaking over 50 years ago, and today, we own and operate 30 electric arc furnaces with 4 more under construction. EAF steelmaking and our unique entrepreneurial culture have made us the industry leader and our current strategy, we will keep Nucor out in front as we continue to deliver the financial results and capabilities our investors and customers have come to expect. Today, Nucor leads the North American steel industry across financial, operational and environmental criteria. Value creation for shareholders through prudent capital deployment is our primary financial objective. Since the beginning of 2020, we have invested over $12 billion in CapEx and strategic acquisitions to grow our core and expand beyond.', 'During the same time, our average annual ROE has exceeded 30% and our annualized EPS growth rate has exceeded 40%. In terms of operation, Nucor makes approximately 1 out of every 4 tons of steel produced in the United States. We have a highly efficient business model and our unrivaled breadth of products and capabilities serve the widest range of end markets. Sustainability is a key differentiator for Nucor and a major part of our growth strategy. We are the largest recycler in the Western Hemisphere and among the lowest in greenhouse gas intensity across global steelmaking. And we are taking steps to position us even better for the future. Supplying customers with the sustainable solutions they have come to expect. That’s why we helped create the Global Steel Climate Council and announced a commitment towards net zero steelmaking by 2050 across Scopes 1, 2 and 3.', 'Our business strategy and investments are driving growth for shareholders. In raw materials, we are leveraging our market intelligence and flexible supply chain to provide more sustainable inputs. We are investing in advanced scrap separation technologies and near zero emission iron-making and we have partnered with ExxonMobil to capture and store up to 800,000 tons of CO2 per year at our Louisiana DRI facility beginning in 2026. In our Steel Mills segment, we are shifting the mix toward higher margin value-added products. We continue to ramp up Brandenburg, the most capable EAF plate mill in the world. We are constructing a state-of-the-art sheet mill in West Virginia. And we are expanding our rebar micro mill footprint, targeting some of the highest growth regions in the U.S. Turning to Steel Products, we have a strategic advantage on the supply side, given the integration between our mills and steel product teams.', 'We’ll continue to leverage this advantage while pursuing more cross-selling and companion tons through our solutions teams and we are investing in automation and technology to improve efficiency and reduce the risk of injuries. And finally, our Expand Beyond strategy into its steel adjacent platforms is paying off. We are leveraging our core competencies to grow into higher margin businesses aligned with steel-intensive megatrends. We are executing this strategy through a combination of acquisitions and organic growth, including the construction of 2 new utility structure production facilities. For 2023, our Expand Beyond platforms contributed roughly $415 million in EBITDA, led by overhead doors and insulated metal panels. We remain confident in hitting our $700 million EBITDA run-rate goal for Expand Beyond divisions in the coming years.', 'We believe the American steel industry is still on the front end of megatrends working their way into steel markets. We are starting to see some increased activity in certain markets like bridge and highway, semiconductor chip plants, EV factories and renewable energy. And as we have shared before, Nucor expects the federal programs that support these megatrends to add somewhere between 5 million to 8 million tons of incremental annual demand for steel over the next several years. While the long-term trends look favorable, we have seen some pockets of slower-than-expected activity. For instance, adoption rates for electric vehicles are tracking lower than some have predicted and several offshore wind projects have been canceled or delayed due to supply chain challenges as well as higher costs.', 'Warehouse starts are expected to decline again in 2024, but we still expect them to stay above pre-pandemic levels. And despite some of these near-term headwinds, Nucor remains optimistic about the longer term prospects for these end markets. Non-res construction is our largest end market and it has proven to be incredibly resilient. Some of the strongest growth is coming from the sharp rise in advanced manufacturing and infrastructure investment, both expected to rise double-digits over the next 2 years according to Dodge construction forecast. This is helping to offset some of the softness we are seeing for more rate sensitive sectors, which should begin to pick up later in the year if interest rate cuts occur as many expect. Before turning it over to Steve, I’d like to share a few thoughts on how Nucor’s business model continues to deliver attractive returns for our shareholders.', 'From 2020 to 2023, we have generated a combined EBITDA over $30 billion, net earnings of nearly $20 billion, and returned nearly $10 billion to our shareholders. Throughout it all, we have maintained the strongest balance sheet of any North American steel producer, allowing us to grow the company by investing in higher margin, less volatile businesses. As our results demonstrate, Nucor is a growth company. And given our investment plans and the long-term outlook for steel in the U.S., we see more opportunities for growth in the years ahead. With that, I will turn it over to Steve who will share additional details on our financial results and near-term outlook. Steve?', 'Steve Laxton: Thank you, Leon and thanks to our shareholders for joining us this morning. Nucor ended 2023 on a strong note with fourth quarter consolidated net earnings of $785 million, including $127 million of pre-operating startup cost. We exceeded the midpoint of our guidance due primarily to better-than-expected performance from our Steel Mills segment in the month of December. In addition to solid earnings for the quarter, the power of Nucor’s business model allowed us to generate more than $1.5 billion of operating cash flow during the quarter, with working capital contributing about $250 million of that total. Turning to our operating segment results, our Steel Mills Group generated $588 million of pre-tax earnings in the fourth quarter, a decrease of 33% from the third quarter.', 'Total steel mill shipments declined 4% from the prior quarter and realized pricing for the segment was lower across all major products. Our mill utilization rate was 74%, down from 77% in the prior quarter, but higher than the 70% in the fourth quarter of 2022. In the back half of the fourth quarter, we saw an uptick in customer confidence as the UAW strikes were resolved and the Federal Reserve signaled the end to interest rate hikes. Shipment volumes increased as the quarter progressed and we began to realize higher pricing for sheet steel consistent with pricing trends in the published indices. We are expecting further improvements in both shipments and realized pricing to favorably impact results in the first quarter of 2024. Our Steel Products segment delivered another strong quarter with pre-tax earnings of $656 million.', 'This represented just over half the total segment earnings for the fourth quarter and is the sixth consecutive quarter with Steel Products contributed at least 40% of our total segment earnings. For the year, Steel Products generated segment earnings of $3.4 billion, its second best year behind 2022. Realized pricing and margins continued to moderate in the fourth quarter, but on an earnings per ton basis for the full year of 2023, only gave up about 6 percentage points. Our Raw Materials segment posted a pre-tax loss of about $14 million for the quarter. Compared to the prior quarter, pricing was relatively stable, but output was lower and per ton cost rose due to planned outages at our DRI facilities. Now turning to capital allocation, with $2.2 billion in capital spending and $2.1 billion in shareholder returns in 2023, Nucor once again demonstrated a measured and balanced approach to its capital deployment.', 'With respect to our shareholder returns, it’s worth noting that next week we will pay our 203rd consecutive quarterly cash dividend in the amount of $0.54 per share. This represents a 6% increase over the prior dividend. As Leon highlighted, Nucor is taking meaningful steps to grow its earnings power and cash flow potential. Since 2018, we have been able to increase our dividend by 42% and reduced our shares outstanding by 23%. For the foreseeable future, we remain confident we will continue to be able to return at least 40% of our net earnings to shareholders by way of dividends and share repurchases. A cornerstone of our capital allocation framework is a commitment to a strong investment grade credit rating and liquidity that enables our strategy.', 'Nucor’s balance sheet remains well positioned to enable continued execution of our balanced capital allocation philosophy, with a debt-to-capital ratio of 25% and a debt-to-EBITDA ratio of less than 1%. We have a long history of putting capital to use and returning capital to shareholders. Given that principle and our ambitious growth plans, we do expect to end 2024 with a lower cash balance than when we started the year. We finished 2023 with a strong cash position for several reasons. First, with more than $7 billion of cash from operations, we generated robust cash flows throughout the year. Second, we experienced some timing delays in our planned capital spending. And finally, we were preserving liquidity for possible acquisition opportunities, which ultimately did not materialize.', 'Now that we have broken ground in West Virginia, the pace of our capital spending should accelerate. For 2024, we expect total capital expenditures of approximately $3.5 billion, with our 7 largest growth projects represented approximately two-thirds of this total. In addition, we are firmly committed to growing our portfolio of solutions and expand beyond footprint through value-creating acquisitions. To that end, we are actively fostering a pipeline of acquisition candidates. As always, we will be selective, opportunistic and disciplined in our approach. But unlike our organic growth strategy, the timing and size of potential acquisitions is far less predictable. Looking ahead to the first quarter of 2024, we expect consolidated earnings to be higher than the prior quarter, with improved performance from the steel mills and raw materials segments, partially offset by weaker earnings from the Steel Products segment.', 'For the Steel Mills segment, we expect quarterly earnings to increase due to higher realized pricing and higher volumes, in particular, from our sheet mills. In the Steel Products segment, we expect lower realized pricing compared with the prior quarter. Across most of our steel products groups, current backlogs are consistent with historic norms, while margins have remained higher than historic averages. For the Raw Materials segment, we expect modest profitability on higher shipments and relatively stable pricing. Looking ahead, 2024 appears to have a more stable outlook than may have been expected just a few months ago, with a reasonable probability of seeing the much discussed soft landing. As Leon mentioned in his opening remarks, the U.S. economy appears relatively healthy with inflation and unemployment metrics continuing to trend favorably.', 'Market expectations for gradual declines in interest rates could result in more demand for consumer durables, light vehicles and increased activity across a broad construction sector. As the most diversified producer of steel and steel products with the widest array of market solutions, these potential expectations bode well for Nucor. Looking beyond 2024, several steel-intensive megatrends are only in the early stages. While economic cycles will continue to impact the markets, we broadly see positive demand drivers that provide a constructive backdrop to Nucor’s midterm growth potential. With that, we’d be happy to take your questions.

In fact, efficiency level, which measures a company's capability to transform available input into output, is often considered an important parameter for gauging its potential to make profits."", 'However, at times it becomes difficult to measure the efficiency level of a company. This is why one must consider popular efficiency ratios while selecting stocks.', 'These efficiency ratios are:', 'Receivables Turnover: This is the ratio of 12-month sales to four-quarter average receivables. It shows a company\'s potential to extend its credit and collect debt in terms of that credit. A high receivables turnover ratio or the ""accounts receivable turnover ratio"" or ""debtor\'s turnover ratio"" is desirable as it shows that the company is capable of collecting its accounts receivables or that it has quality customers.', ""Asset Utilization: This ratio indicates a company's capability to convert assets into output and is thus a widely known measure of efficiency level. It is calculated by dividing total sales over the past 12 months by the last four-quarter average of total assets. Like the above ratios, high asset utilization may indicate that a company is efficient."", ""Inventory Turnover: The ratio of the 12-month cost of goods sold (COGS) to a four-quarter average inventory is considered one of the most popular efficiency ratios. It indicates a company's ability to maintain a suitable inventory position. While a high value indicates that the company has a relatively low level of inventory compared to COGS, a low value indicates that the company is facing declining sales, which has resulted in excess inventory."", ""Operating Margin: This efficiency measure is the ratio of operating income over the past 12 months to sales over the same period. It measures a company's ability to control operating expenses. Hence, a high value of the ratio may indicate that the company manages its operating expenses more efficiently than its peers."", 'Here are the top four stocks that made it through the screen:', 'Axonics is focused on the development and commercialization of a novel implantable SNM system for patients with urinary and bowel dysfunction.

On superior results, we're very proud to say that we've had a very strong total shareholder return since IPO of over 1,500%, beating all of the benchmark REIT indices and also every -- almost every other health care REIT."", ""On distinctive impact, Alexandria's tenants whom we have supported are responsible for an astounding 50% of the novel FDA approved therapies over the last decade, truly amazing. And our unique one of a kind full continuum of care 115 project in Dayton, Ohio has treated more than 7,000 patients afflicted by opioid addiction and other substance abuses and has made a dramatic positive impact on the lives of thousands of people, and we're very proud of that accomplishment. And then moving to lasting endurance want to congratulate the Alexandria family team on this significant 30-year anniversary milestone of our founding on January 5, 1994 and who would or could have imagined in 1994 that this fledgling garage startup would have created an entirely new class of real estate at the Vanguard and the heart of the life science industry, combating many of the illnesses, which afflict our family and friends."", ""So moving on to my take on fourth quarter and year-end 2023, I'd say we have witnessed the unprecedented eight-year bull run of the life science capital markets 2014 through 2021, the longest on record, coupled with the rocket ship funding during COVID. And the market in 2023 has clearly reflected the rationalization of the past decade. With respect to Alexandria in 2023, I would say, I would characterize our 2023 overall operating and financial performance as highly resilient. Notable achievements include 11% plus NOI growth year-over-year, 2023 to 2022 in very, very strong. We delivered a record $265 million of incremental NOI in 2023 with our development capabilities moving that to fruition, which are first-in-class. We've continued very solid leasing in 2023 with over 4 million plus rentable square feet leased with very respectable GAAP and cash numbers."", ""Two key leases in fourth quarter, which are noted in the supplement, the lease to Novo Nordisk and the lease to Cargo Therapeutics. 2023, we had a remarkable 76% of leasing with existing tenants, and we look forward to a strong 2024 leasing effort and expect a handful of significant leases to mature soon. We expect to make significant progress on our lease expirations and filling vacant space, while achieving positive rent growth. 2023 we did a highly confident job of self-funding our growth and will continue to do so in 2024. Our balance sheet and liquidity are in the best shape in the company's history, and we're very proud of that accomplishment. We have given and reconfirmed very solid detailed guidance for 2024, and we believe that the life science industry will continue to benefit most importantly, from some key macro tailwinds in 2024, including positive M&A activity, declining interest rates, increased innovation and some great key data readouts."", ""And finally, before I turn it over to Peter to comment on a range of critical issues. I want to comment on the sale of our 42nd Street asset in New York City, leased to Pfizer through midyear 2024. They previously vacated and moved their headquarters to another site in New York City. We made a strategic decision not to go forward with the contemplated redevelopment of that building to in part to state and local to challenging state and local governmental policies. We also had a somewhat similar, but not on the scale reaction back a number of years ago and our successful reduction in our footprint in the city of San Francisco. We have created and grown the commercial life science lab space market in New York City. When we delivered our East Tower and our ACLS mega campus back in 2010, there were only essentially two companies of any significance that we're doing commercial life science research in New York City, many academics, but no -- virtually no commercial."", ""Today, there are over 100 but New York City, the life science market there remains here 14 years later, still a small start-up market. And we believe that by focusing on our ACLS New York City mega campus. That's the best way for us to continue to be successful. And we have taken this disciplined action out of an abundance of prudence. And with that, let me turn the commentary over to Peter."", ""Peter Moglia: Thanks, Joel. In Flagship Pioneerings 2024 Annual Letter, Founder and CEO, Noubar Afeyan, described 2023 as a polycrisis, encompassing the confluence of economic turbulence, climate change, deeply fractured politics, two global wars, threats to democracy, loss of trust in institutions, and continuing dislocations triggered by the COVID epidemic. Alexandria's solid 2023 performance within such a dismal backdrop is nothing less than extraordinary. I don't want to steal too much of Mark's thunder, but leasing close to our average volume since 2018 ex the rocket ship years and maintaining strong earnings growth, while navigating through this poly crisis is a testament to Alexandria's competitive advantage and the power of our brand that Joel and Dan eloquently articulated at Investor Day."", ""Heading into 2024, the poly crisis remains, but so does our resiliency. Our balance sheet is as strong as ever. And in 2023, we proved that we can self-fund our investments and still maintain our lowest leverage level in history. Thus, with our unique business model, highly skilled and experienced talent impeccable execution and a healthy underlying industry poised to advance human and planetary health. We've created the fertile industrial ecosystem, Mr. Afan [ph] postulated can generate value while defending against any coming vulnerabilities, we aim to prove that thesis right. I'm going to discuss our development pipeline, leasing, supply and asset sales and hand it over to Hallie. In the Fourth Quarter, we delivered 1,228,604 square feet into our high barrier to entry submarkets bringing total deliveries for the year to 3,271,170 square feet covering 15 projects."", 'The annual incremental NOI delivered during the year of approximately $265 million and the incremental NOI delivered during the quarter of $145 million are both the highest total in company history. The initial weighted average stabilized deal for 2023 deliveries was 7%, supported by a strong stabilized yield on cost of 7.7% from our fourth quarter deliveries. Development and redevelopment leasing activity of approximately 234,000 square feet was higher quarter-over-quarter for the third reporting period in a row, and the positive momentum is expected to continue as we signed 270,000 square feet of LOIs during the quarter. At quarter end, our pipeline of current and near-term projects are 60% leased or under negotiations, which include executed LOIs. From the first quarter of 2024 through the end of 2027, we expect to deliver approximately 90% of the $495 million of stabilized NOI the current pipeline is expected to generate.', ""Demand from our highly innovative credit tenant base, looking to leverage the place-making and scale of our mega campus model is expected to drive future opportunities, such as the Novo Nordisk lease executed during the quarter for 165,000 square feet at the Alexandria Center for Life Science Waltham, Mega Campus in Greater Boston. Transitioning to leasing and supply. We leased 4,306,072 square feet during the year and 889,737 square feet during the quarter. To put some context to that, it's roughly half of the average of the rocket ship years of 2021 and 2022, but very close to the average volume we leased in the three years prior from 2018 through 2020. We've returned to the fundamentals which were trending positively before 2021 and 2022."", 'So we feel really good about the near- and long-term prospects for our business. We spoke a lot about the competitive advantages that our Mega Campus model affords us during Investor Day. 63% of the total leasing we did during the year was completed in our highly curated Class A mega campuses, located in high barrier to entry life science clusters. And they are the key reason we continue to post strong cash and GAAP rent increases, which came in at 15.8% and 29.4%, respectively, for the year. We believe the beginning of 2023 was the low point for demand and are pleased to see that demand for Greater Boston, San Francisco Bay and San Diego are all up year-over-year. A good sign since this does not include a number of projects that are on hold as management teams and Boards remain cautious.', 'However, that should change soon. As you will hear from Hallie, the trajectory of the industry has turned positive. In the meantime, we continue to win the majority of the current high-quality demand due to tenants prioritizing location, place-making experience, ability to scale, proven operational excellence, reliability and trustworthiness. Our teams continue to closely track supply building-by-building in our proprietary databases. As we turn the page on 2023, we expect 2024 to be the peak year for new deliveries then begin to dissipate in 2025. In Greater Boston, unleased competitive supply estimated to be delivered in 2024 is 7% of market inventory, a 0.9% increase over last quarter, not due to new projects, but because of project deliveries being pushed from 2023 to 2024.', 'In 2025, the unleased competitive supply will increase market inventory by another 2.5%, an expected slowdown from 2024 levels. In San Francisco Bay, unleased competitive supply estimated to be delivered in 2024 is 10.7% of market inventory, which is a 2.7% increase. Like Greater Boston, this increase is driven by projects that were expected to deliver in 2023, but are taking longer than expected. In 2025, the unleased competitive supply will increase market inventory by much less at 2.2%, a good sign, but still a 1% increase over last quarter due to a new project breaking ground in Menlo Park. In San Diego, unleased competitive supply estimated to be delivered in 2024 is 6.8% of market inventory, a slight decrease from last quarter due to an increase in supply from projects being pushed from 2023 to 2024, offset by leasing in those projects.', ""In 2025, the unleased competitive supply will decelerate to 2.7% of market inventory. A quick update on direct and sublease vacancy. Direct vacancy in Greater Boston is up 258 basis points to 7.05%, still mid-single-digits despite a number of deliveries in late 2023. It has climbed 270 basis points to 12.36% in our San Francisco Bay markets due to unleased new deliveries. And in San Diego, the increase has been more modest, rising 121 basis points to 7.97% driven primarily by Serina Therapeutics vacating all of their leases in the region. They are not an Alexandria tenant. Subleased vacancy has remained stable, ranging from 5.4% in San Diego to 5.9% in Boston. I'll conclude with an update on our value harvesting asset recycling program. Continued demand for our assets enabled us to self-fund our investments as we presented at Investor Day."", ""Page 6 of the supplemental summarizes the material transaction closed during the year. What can be taken away from the partial interest sales at 15 Necco and 9625 Town Center Drive and the sale of 11119 North Torrey Pines Road is that well-located and stabilized assets located in Alexandria's primary submarkets continue to command a premium valuation. Others in solid locations, but in need of material CapEx for repositioning such as the Second Avenue and Memorial portfolio in Greater Boston completed in the Second Quarter and the Memorial Drive Beaver Street and Roselle Street portfolio completed in the fourth quarter, delivered solid per square foot valuations due to their solid historical performance. Due to the unstabilized nature of these portfolio sales, the cap rates will not provide any meaningful insights to return expectations on stabilized properties."", ""However, I can point you to Healthpeak's 65% sale of 3020 and 3030 Callan Ridge Road in Torrey Pines as a directional comp. The building is fully leased long-term to a credit tenant but is not expected to be occupied by said tenant. The purchase price yielded a 5.3% cap rate despite that change or despite that challenge. As we presented at Investor Day, our strategies that continue to widen the moat with competitive advantages our mega campus model provides by recycling our non-campus assets into our current and future mega campuses. With that, I'll pass the call over to Hallie."", 'Hallie Kuhn: Thank you, Peter, and good afternoon, everyone. This is Hallie Kuhn, SVP of Science and Technology and Capital Markets. Today, I will provide a recap of the life science industry in 2023 and an overview of the health and demand drivers of each of our life science tenant segments as we kick off 2024. John Templeton wisely wrote that bull markets are born on pessimism, grow on skepticism, mature on optimism and die of euphoria. While the reset of the life science industry from euphoric 2021 highs has been rocky, healthy pessimism is seeding renewed momentum, underscored by rational valuations and capital flowing to the strongest technologies and experienced management teams. Fundamentally, the staggering unmet medical need that drives the $5 trillion secularly growing life science industry has not debated, and the opportunity for companies and investors in the life science sector to positively impact human health and disease is massive.', 'Through the ups and downs, the trajectory of the industry is positive, translating long-term, into a healthy and expanding tenant base. This sentiment is reflected in the numbers. The XBI, a weighted index of small and mid-cap biotech ended 2023, up 8%. Large biopharma performance, which had an exceptional 2022, while the rest of the market generally languished, ended flat. Two notable exceptions were Alexandria tenants, Eli Lilly and Novo Nordisk both of which ended the year up over 50% as the market for their novel diabetes and obesity medicines accelerated. And as Peter mentioned, in December, we announced a significant lease with Novo Nordisk for their new US R&D headquarters on our Waltham Mega campus in Greater Boston. Another 2023 biopharma trend was M&A.', ""Excluding mega mergers over $50 billion, 2023 set a new high watermark with $159 billion in acquisitions. These were largely sub-$10 billion deals driven by pharma's need to bolster pipelines as they face steep revenue loss due to patent expirations. As M&A dollars are recycled back into the industry, it creates a positive cycle of innovation as scientists and entrepreneurs start their next new venture. Altogether, the M&A life cycle is an important driver of demand across our regions. With respect to the FDA, 55 novel medicines were approved in 2023, the second highest year on record and double the average number of annual approvals 20 years ago. There were also eight advanced cell and gene therapies approved. Tenant Vertex received FDA approval of CASGEVY this December, a potentially curative therapy for severe sickle cell disease and the first approved treatment utilizing a novel genome editing technology known as CRISPR."", ""The takeaway is that the industry's model is working, novel scientific discoveries, such as CRISPR, which was elucidated just over a decade ago are translating into impactful medicines for patients. Now let's take a closer look at the health and demand across each of our life science tenant segments. First, large pharma, which makes up 19% of our ARR continues to deploy substantial capital towards internal and external R&D, equating to over $270 billion in R&D spend. Commitment to R&D is an imperative for pharma. Over the next decade, the top 20 pharma are staring down approximately $200 billion of lost revenue as patents expire, new competitors enter the market and a subset of medicines become subject to potential price setting by Medicare through the recently enacted IRA legislation."", ""And where does pharma look to offset gap in revenue to smaller and nimbler biotechs. Currently, $3 out of every $5 of top 20 pharma revenue stemmed from medicines acquired through M&A and partnerships. Fortunately, this segment is well positioned with strong balance sheets and an estimated $1 trillion in available firepower to leverage. All told, we expect healthy levels of internal research and M&A to continue through 2024 and beyond. Importantly, innovation requires people and a critical component of the pharma equation is stellar talent. Recruiting and retaining scientists is more important than ever. Cancer can't be cured from the couch and expectations of a scientific workforce where working from home is not an option or high, requiring amenities and community that the scale of Alexandria's mega campuses are uniquely positioned to provide."", ""This need is driving several large pharma requirements across our clusters. Transitioning to public biotechnology. Our ARR from biotechs with marketed products increased to 17% compared to 14% in 3Q. This increase is due to the delivery of Moderna's new headquarters at 325 Binney Street on our One Kendall Square mega campus, as well as several clinical stage companies transitioning to commercial stage after receiving marketing approval for new therapies. This segment continues to mature, with tenants such as Vertex eclipsing a market cap of $100 billion in 2023. Next step are our pre-commercial public biotech companies, which represent 8% of our ARR. For this segment, data trumps all. Companies that meet expected milestones have executed significant follow-on financings and stock prices have responded positively."", 'In total, nearly $20 billion in follow-on financing was raised on U.S. stock exchanges in 2023, a quarter of which was raised by Alexandria tenants. Companies have also tapped alternative financing structures such as pipes and royalty deals providing additional access to liquidity. Our San Francisco-based tenant BridgeBio has raised over $900 million in the past 12 months from a combination of these sources, driven by clinical data for a novel medicine treating transthyretin amyloid cardiomyopathy, a potential fatal disease of the heart muscle. As the IPO market cracks open in 2024, companies with the right clinical pedigree will be able to access additional liquidity. Last week, the first IPO of the year by asset-based CG Oncology priced above their target range and raised $380 million.', ""On to private biotechnology, which encompasses 10% of our ARR, while life science venture investments slowed in 2023 relative to the highs of 2021 and 2022, it still exceeds pre-COVID levels and came in at approximately $40 billion. Series A, B and C rounds are predominantly being led by outside investors. Speaking to healthy levels of new investments, with the caveat that valuations have come down and deals often take longer to close. Funds have been conservative deploying the capital raised in the past several years and have ample dry powder. As the market's warm, we expect venture activity to remain strong through 2024. One counterbalance is that we may see less later-stage financings as a subset of companies go public instead of raising another round of private capital."", 'Next, our life science product, service and device tenants, which represent 21% of our ARR. This segment includes contract manufacturers, diagnostic firms and research tool companies, all of which are critical and complementary to companies developing new medicines. For example, research tool companies are creating the next generation of advanced life science technologies such as super-resolution microscopes and DNA sequencers that can process an entire genome in half a day. These technologies often require large specialized footprints, complex infrastructure and highly trained scientific talent. As the trusted brand for life science real estate, our tenants look to Alexandria to safeguard the billions of dollars of equipment, intellectual property and assets housed within their labs.', 'Last, our institutional tenants totaling 11% ARR as well-funded often credit tenants, institutions continue to be an engine of innovation within our ecosystems. One pioneering institutional tenant that came out of stealth this month is Cambridge-based Arena BioWorks. With $500 million in funding, Arena hired scientific luminaries from around the country, with the goal to combine and accelerate academic research and venture-backed drug development under one roof. Returning to where we started, the life science industry is squarely in the realm of healthy skepticism, exceeding the very early innings of the next bull run. We are not completely out of the woods yet with question marks around interest rates and 2024 election looming. However, accelerating pace of scientific innovation, access to significant capital from multiple sources and enormous unmet need for life-saving therapies will propel the industry forward and translate into healthy demand and increasing long-term revenue.', 'With that, I will pass it over to Marc.', ""Marc Binda: Thank you, Hallie. This is Marc Binda here. Hello, and good afternoon, everyone. Congratulations to our entire team for outstanding execution this past year in a very challenging macroeconomic environment. I'll start with our solid financial results. Total revenues and NOI for 2023 were up 11.5% and 12.2%, respectively, over 22%, primarily driven by solid same-property performance and record high development and redevelopment projects placed into service in 2023 with an incremental annual NOI of $265 million. FFO per share diluted as adjusted was $897, up a solid 6.5% over 2022. We're very proud to report solid operating results for the year, driven by disciplined execution of our mega campus strategy. Our tenants continue to appreciate our brand collaborative mega campuses and our operational excellence by our team."", 'We have high-quality cash flows with 52% of our annual rental revenue as of 4Q 2023 from investment-grade and publicly traded large-cap tenants, up 3% from the prior quarter. And we have one of the highest quality client rosters in the REIT industry. 75% of our annual rental revenue comes from our collaborative mega campuses, collections remained very high at 99.9%, adjusted EBITDA margins remained strong at 69% and 96% of our leases contain annual rent escalations approximating 3%. Now, solid rental rate growth and leasing volume drove same-property NOI growth in 2023, up 3.4% and 4.6% on a cash basis. These results were in line with our previous guidance and very solid results, especially considering the macro environment. As expected, our Fourth Quarter same-property results took some pressure due to some temporary vacancy and four properties spread across Boston, San Francisco and San Diego, comprising about 330,000 square feet that is 64% leased or negotiating.', 'We expect same property results to accelerate in the second half of 2024, driven by anticipated solid rental rate growth, occupancy growth in the second half of the year, coupled with the four properties I just mentioned, as well as contractual rent increases and the burn-off of contractual free rent from executed leases. We expect solid same property growth for 2024 consistent with what we provided at our Investor Day in December, up 1.5% and 4% on a cash basis at the mid point of our guidance range. Leasing volume in the fourth quarter was solid at 890,000 square feet for the quarter and 4.3 million for the year, which is in line with our general historical average from 2013 to 2020. We continue to benefit from our long-standing tenant relationships and brand loyalty with 76% of our leasing completed in 2023 coming from existing tenant relationships.', 'Rental rate growth for lease renewals and releasing space in 2023 was very strong at 29.4% and 15.8% on a cash basis. These are very solid results and are the third highest annual amounts, compared to the 10 years preceding the rocket ship years of 2021 and 2022. 4Q 2023 rental rate growth for lease renewals and releasing of space was 9.2% and 5.5% on a cash basis. Due to the incredible execution by our team, we were able to backfill the roughly 100,000 square foot former Atreca space in San Carlos with a very exciting clinical-stage biotech company called Cargo Therapeutics during the quarter at solid economics, including no TIs and limited downtime. The starting cash rent on that deal was slightly negative at about negative 4% compared to the most recent in-place rents from [indiscernible] that was three years into a 10-year lease.', 'Given the quarterly results are driven by a relatively small amount of square feet, the relatively flat results from this transaction had a meaningful impact on the quarterly rental rate increases. Excluding this transaction, rental rate increases for the quarter would have been 21.4% and 9.7% on a cash basis. We expect solid rental rate growth on lease renewals and releasing of space for 2024 at a midpoint of 15% and 9% on a cash basis with some variation from quarter-to-quarter. The overall mark-to-market for cash rental rates related to our in-place leases for the entire asset base remains solid at 14%. Our non-revenue-enhancing expenditures, including TIs and leasing commissions on second generation space have averaged 15% of NOI over the last five years and remained low during 2023 and in the 12% to 13% range.', ""Year-end occupancy was solid at 94.6%, up 90 basis points from the prior quarter and the primary driver of the increase from the third quarter was space that was delivered in San Diego. The midpoint of our guidance range for occupancy for year-end 2024 is 95.1%, so we do expect some modest growth in occupancy through the year as well as growth in same-property occupancy in the second half of the year. Transitioning to the balance sheet. We have one of the strongest balance sheets in the company's history as of 4Q 2023. Our corporate credit rankings link in the top 10% of all publicly traded US public REITs. We met our goal for year-end leverage of 5.1 times for net debt to adjusted EBITDA on a quarterly annualized basis. And we ended the year with tremendous liquidity of $5.8 billion fixed rate debt comprising 98.1% of our total debt, a weighted average remaining term of debt of 12.8 years and no debt maturities until 2025."", 'Only 20% of our debt matures in the next five years and 29% of our debt matures in 2049 and beyond with an attractive rate of 3.91%. We continue to focus on the enhancement of our overall asset base and the recycling of capital through outright dispositions of assets that are not integral to our mega campus strategy. We recognize that these types of assets will likely have a higher cost of capital than our core assets located in our mega campuses, but this will allow us to recycle these proceeds into our highly leased development and redevelopment pipeline and to continue to enhance our mega campus strategy. For 2023, we completed dispositions and partial interest sales of $1.3 billion, including $439 million of dispositions completed in the fourth quarter.', ""Importantly, during 2023, we did not issue any new common equity other than the settlement of our outstanding forward equity contracts from 2022, which raised $104 million and we're very proud of our strong execution capability. The team is laser focused on the execution of our capital plan headed into 2024, and we have pending dispositions subject to letters of intent or sales agreements for another $142 million that we expect to close in 2024. Based upon our current outlook, we expect our asset recycling program to be more heavily weighted towards outright dispositions of non-core assets rather than partial interest sales in 2024. In the fourth quarter, we recognized impairments aggregating $271.9 million, which included two significant items."", ""First was the $94.8 million charge related to the sale of 380 and 420 East Street located in the Seaport, which had been announced last quarter and subsequently closed during the fourth quarter. And then second, as Joel mentioned, $93.5 million of a charge related to an office property located in Manhattan, which was classified as held for sale this quarter. The New York project Joel mentioned was acquired in 2018 as a covered land project with a leaseback and in-place cash flows. But in the fourth quarter, we elected not to proceed with the conversion project and this is now under contract and expected to be sold next year. Cash flows from operating activities after dividends for 2024 is expected to be very strong at $450 million at the midpoint of our guidance, and we'll continue to support growth in our annual common stock dividends per share."", ""We had a low conservative FFO payout ratio of 56% for the quarter with a 6% average per share dividend increase over the last five years and at this pace of retained cash flows over the next three years, Cash flows from operating activities after dividends should generate close to $1.4 billion of efficient capital for reinvestment. Now I'll turn to a couple of important highlights on the external growth side. 2023 and 4Q 2023 were both record years in terms of the amount of incremental annual NOI onboarded with $265 million and $145 million, respectively. Importantly, about 80% of the annual rental revenue delivered in the fourth quarter was the investment-grade or publicly traded large cap tenants, including Moderna and Eli Lilly. With a very large amount of deliveries around mid-quarter on average in the fourth quarter, we expect a significant earnings benefit headed into 1Q 2024."", ""We expect tremendous growth in incremental annual net operating income on a cash basis of $114 million upon the burn-off of initial free rent related to recently delivered projects with a weighted average burn-off period of about 10 months. And as Peter highlighted, we have 5.7 million rentable square feet of projects that are 60% leased or negotiating and projects that will generate $495 million of incremental annual net operating income over the next four years. A key item to highlight here is that we had strong leasing activity in the pipeline with over 500,000 square feet either leased or added to the negotiating bucket through signed LOIs during the quarter, which was the most we've had since 2Q 2022. Next, on capitalized interest, our outlook for capitalized interest for 2024 is consistent with our previous guidance."", ""And as a reminder, we expect capitalized interest for 2024 to be impacted by the following: First, and overall decline in average real estate basis subject to capitalization compared to 2023, which was driven in part by the large basis placed into service in the fourth quarter of 2023, and second, we expect an offsetting increase caused by an uptick in our weighted average interest rate on borrowings used in the calculation of capitalization of interest in 2024 compared to 2023. I'll turn next to venture investments. Realized gains from venture investments included in FFO per share as adjusted for the quarter was $12.3 million, which was below our recent run rate, in part due to a large realized loss on one of our investments that occurred late in the quarter."", 'FFO per share as adjusted over the last three years has included on average, $96 million of realized gains in each year from venture investments or approximately $24 million per quarter. Our outlook for quarterly realized gains from venture investments in 2024 and is $95 million to $125 million, which is modestly above our three-year annual average of $96 million. Gross unrealized gains in our venture investments as of the end of the quarter were $320 million on a cost basis of just under $1.2 billion. Turning to guidance. We have reaffirmed our solid guidance for 2024 that was initially provided in connection with our Annual Investor Day on November 29th, with a few minor changes as outlined in our supplemental package on Page 4. Our range for guidance for EPS is $3.49 to $3.69 and our range for FFO per share diluted as adjusted is $9.37 to $9.57, with no change in the midpoint of $9.47, which represents a solid 5.6% growth in FFO per share, following excellent growth last year of 6.5%.', 'Lastly, our ATM program expired in early January of this year upon the expiration of our shelf registration, so we do expect to file a new program here in the near future.

This highly integrated solution is optimized for mass-market smartphones.', ""It combines in a single placement, the low, mid, and high band main path content traditionally offered in two placements. This reduces surface area by 40%, simplifies design, and accelerates time to market. In addition to developing highly integrated solutions with increasing levels of functional density, we're also advancing technology in our high-performance discrete portfolio, including our BAW filters. During the quarter, we received purchase orders for discrete BAW filters using our recently released next-generation BAW technology. During the quarter we continue to bring channel inventories down and now our shipments are more closely aligned with end-market demand. We are also seeing incremental improvement in end-market demand in the Android ecosystem."", ""For calendar 2024, we expect total smartphone units to grow in low single digits, with 5G units growing over 10%. To compete and win, we collaborate with customers on their three-year product roadmaps and we supply them industry-leading solutions. We enjoy our position as the preferred strategic RF supplier for all the customers we serve in the Android space, and we are very well positioned to benefit as their portfolios continue to transition to 5G. In summary, demand for Qorvo's products has improved, primarily due to our proactive efforts to align channel inventories with end-market demand and content gains on key customer programs. We are delivering customers industry-leading products and technologies, and design activity remains robust."", 'This positions Qorvo favorably for continued strong content and durable long-term growth. And with that, let me hand the call over to Grant.', 'Grant Brown: Thanks, Bob, and good afternoon, everyone. Revenue for the quarter was $1.074 billion. Non-GAAP gross margin was 43.8% and non-GAAP diluted EPS was $2.10, all exceeding the midpoint of our guidance range. Revenue increased approximately 44% year-over-year and continue to benefit from significant content gains at our largest customer. As communicated last quarter, ACG achieved year-over-year growth in September, CSG achieved year-over-year growth during the September quarter, and we expect HPA to achieve strong year-over-year growth in the March quarter. Regarding gross margin, a larger portion of December revenue was manufactured internally during periods of lower utilization, which led to higher unit costs compared to the September quarter.', 'Factory utilization is improving and the impact from underutilization in factory-related variances continues to moderate. Non-GAAP operating expenses in the quarter were $234 million. We continue to invest in new product development as it is a critical catalyst for driving multi-year growth across all three business segments. Alongside these growth-oriented investments, we continue to launch productivity initiatives across the enterprise. These initiatives also spanning multiple years, are designed to support future growth, augment productivity, and enhance profitability. In total, non-GAAP operating income in the quarter was $237 million or 22% of sales. Non-GAAP net income was $206 million, representing diluted earnings per share of $2.10.', ""Turning to the cash flow statement. We're pleased to report that during the December quarter, we generated a free cash flow of $467 million, setting a new quarterly record for Qorvo. Our capital expenditures for the period were $26 million and we repurchased approximately $100 million of stock at $94 per share. The rate and pace of our share repurchases consider several factors, including our long-term financial outlook, free cash flow, debt maturities, alternative uses of cash, and other relevant strategic considerations. This approach ensures that our capital allocation strategy balances future growth with the return of capital, and aligns with our underlying goal of delivering long-term shareholder value. On the balance sheet, as of quarter end, we had approximately $1.6 billion of long-term debt outstanding and over $1 billion of cash and equivalents."", 'Regarding balance sheet presentation, the 2024 notes have been reclassified as current and will mature in December. Subject to changes in the interest rate environment and other factors, we currently expect to retire these notes later this year. In line with the expectations shared during our previous earnings call, we successfully reduced our net inventory balance over the period. We ended the quarter with a net inventory balance of $727 million, a sequential decrease of $113 million. In terms of days of inventory, this represents a decrease from 138 days in the September quarter, to 118 days in the December quarter. This reduction reflects our commitment to efficient inventory management, and we expect continued improvement in the March quarter.', 'Turning to the current quarter outlook, we expect revenue of approximately $925 million plus or minus $25 million, non-GAAP gross margin of approximately 42%, and non-GAAP diluted EPS of $1.20 at the midpoint of the revenue range. Relative to December, we expect March revenue to reflect a larger percentage of higher cost inventories previously manufactured internally during periods of lower utilization. As these higher cost previously manufactured inventories sell through, it paves the way for future gross margins that reflect increasing levels of utilization. We currently expect to have sold through most of these higher cost inventories and associated costs by the second half of this calendar year. We project non-GAAP operating expenses in the March quarter will be approximately $245 million, with variability related to labor-related expenses and the timing of program development spend.', ""Below the operating income line, non-operating expense is expected to be approximately $10 million, reflecting interest paid on our fixed rate debt, offset by interest income earned on our cash balances, FX gains or losses, along with other items. Our non-GAAP tax rate for fiscal 2024 is expected to be within a range of 11% to 13%. In December, we announced a new partnership with Luxshare related to the divestiture of our Beijing and Dezhou assembly and test facilities. Upon the closing of this transaction, Luxshare will acquire each facility's operations and assets, which includes the property, plant, and equipment, as well as the existing workforce, to enable the seamless continuity of operations. Qorvo will continue to maintain our sales, product and test engineering, and customer support employees in China."", 'We believe that adding Luxshare as a strategic partner will strengthen our position to serve our customers globally. As it relates to our manufacturing strategy, this is a further step in our ongoing efforts to reduce capital intensity. This move aligns with previous actions, including the closure of our Florida manufacturing operations and the recent sale of our Farmers Branch facility in Texas. We are efficiently managing a complex supply chain, including our internal factories, which support all three operating segments and will remain an ongoing focus. We will leverage internal manufacturing where it uniquely differentiates our products and outsource production where we maintain a strong network of foundry and OSAT partners. Qorvo is well positioned to capitalize on multiple growth drivers within each of our three operating segments.', 'We are confident that our investments in our technology portfolio, product development, and advanced manufacturing will broaden our addressable market, diversify revenue, expand margin, and accelerate growth. At this time, please open the line for questions. Thank you.', 'See also 12 Best February Dividend Stocks To Buy and 13 Best Aerospace Stocks To Buy On Sale.', 'To continue reading the Q&A session, please click here.']"

Although the CBOE Volatility Index is currently at a multiyear low, investors have watched as the three major stock indexes have vacillated between bear and bull markets in successive years since the start of 2020.', ""When the going gets tough on Wall Street, investors have historically turned their attention to time-tested businesses with a history of outperformance. Though the FAANG stocks are one example of a group of consistent outperformers, it's stocks enacting splits that have been the preferred choice by investors over the past two-plus years."", 'A ""stock split"" is an event that allows a publicly traded company to alter both its share price and outstanding share count without having any impact on its market cap or operating performance. It\'s nothing more than a cosmetic change that can make a company\'s share price more nominally affordable for everyday investors via a forward-stock split, or can help a company remain listed on a major stock exchange by increasing its share price, as with a reverse-stock split.', 'Although there have been a couple of instances of publicly traded companies making investors richer years after a reverse-stock split, most investors tend to flock to companies enacting forward splits.', 'Since mid-2021, nine high-profile companies have completed forward splits, including megacap superstar Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA), e-commerce company Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN), and internet search behemoth Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOGL)(NASDAQ: GOOG), to name a few. Nvidia completed a 4-for-1 split in 2021, while Amazon and Alphabet enacted respective 20-for-1 splits in 2022.', 'What these former stock-split stocks all share is seemingly impenetrable moats.', ""Nvidia has developed into the infrastructure backbone of the artificial intelligence (AI) movement. The company's A100 and H100 graphics processing units (GPUs) might account for an up-to 90% share of the GPUs deployed in AI-accelerated data centers this year. Even with new competitors entering the space, Nvidia isn't going to be relinquishing its AI-GPU dominance anytime soon."", ""Amazon's online marketplace accounted for 39.5% of online retail sales in the U.S. in 2022, according to Insider Intelligence. That's over eight percentage points higher than its 14 closest competitors, combined! What's more, Amazon Web Services (AWS) is the world's leading provider of cloud-infrastructure services."", ""Alphabet's Google was responsible for nearly 92% of worldwide internet search share in December 2023 and has tallied at least a 90% share of monthly internet search dating back over eight years. Meanwhile, YouTube (which Alphabet owns) is the second most-visited social site on the planet, and Google Cloud has become the third-biggest global cloud-infrastructure service provider, by market share."", 'Impenetrable moats, exceptional execution, and top-tier innovation is why former stock-split stocks have succeeded.', 'Earlier this week, a new ""member"" announced its introduction to this exclusive group.', 'Following the closing bell on Jan. 30, retail giant Walmart (NYSE: WMT) announced plans to conduct a 3-for-1 stock split in the weeks to come.', 'According to Doug McMillon, the CEO and president of Walmart, the intent of its stock split is to ensure that its employees can purchase whole shares rather than fractional shares of the company\'s stock. Said McMillon, ""Given our growth and our plans for the future, we felt it was a good time to split the stock and encourage our associates to participate in the years to come.""', ""Interestingly, this stock split is going to de-emphasize Walmart's influence in the ageless Dow Jones Industrial Average. The Dow is a share price-weighted index, and Walmart's share price is about to decline from about $165 to roughly $55 by the time the market opens for trading on Feb. 26, 2024. Whereas Walmart is currently the 17th most influential stock in the Dow, it could be in the bottom five following its split."", ""However, this is a minor price to pay to reflect Walmart's decades of outperformance."", ""One reason Walmart has been virtually unstoppable is the company's sheer size. Having deep pockets and virtually unparalleled product variety means it can undercut smaller/local stores on price. Furthermore, its selection and lower price points make it a logical choice for cost-conscious consumers. If above-average inflation rates persist, Walmart would be a clear beneficiary."", ""Innovation and adaptation are additional ingredients to Walmart's decades-long outperformance. Just last year, Walmart outlined plans to increase automation and data reliance in its supply chain to improve inventory accuracy, bolster its omnichannel sales platform, and ultimately make the company nimbler when it comes to adapting to changing consumer demands. By the end of fiscal year 2026 (Jan. 31, 2026), Walmart anticipates that roughly 55% of its fulfillment-center volume will be handled by automated facilities."", ""The company's aggressive investments in technology will further enhance its competitive edge. Average unit cost should decline, which will allow the company to pay higher wages to workers who are making a difference on the front lines."", ""Nevertheless, Walmart is on track to end January with a forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio north of 25. That's the priciest this stock has been in at least a decade. Even with its top-notch competitive advantages, Walmart will likely need more than short-lived, stock-split euphoria to push its valuation higher."", ""With Walmart officially breaking the seal on brand-name, forward-stock splits in 2024, it's just a matter of time until another high-flying stock follows in its footsteps. While there's no way to concretely know which widely owned company will join the ranks of the elite stock-split stocks next, I'd be betting on semiconductor company Broadcom (NASDAQ: AVGO) to be the next in line."", 'Prior to being acquired by Avago in 2016, Broadcom had conducted a couple of forward-stock splits. On the other hand, Avago (which kept the Broadcom name following the buyout) has never enacted a stock split. But with shares of the company climbing more than 2,100% over the trailing decade to north of $1,200 per share, now looks like as good a time as any to make its stock more nominally affordable for everyday investors.', ""Broadcom's bread and butter has long been its wireless-focused operations. This is a company that makes wireless chips and accessories used in next-generation smartphones. The 5G revolution has encouraged consumers and businesses to upgrade their wireless devices to take advantage of faster download speeds. This ongoing replacement cycle has steadily lifted Broadcom's operating cash flow."", ""I'd be remiss if I didn't also mention Broadcom's backlog. Although CEO Hock Tan wasn't as forthcoming with his company's backlog in 2023 as he was in the previous year, he did note that Broadcom had a whopping $31 billion in orders in its backlog as of September 2022. An extensive backlog minimizes recessionary fears and all but ensures predictable cash flow for the company."", ""However, the fuel that's helped Broadcom's stock effectively double over the past eight months is AI. Last year, Broadcom unveiled its Jericho3-AI chip, which can connect up to 32,000 GPUs at once in high-compute data centers. Broadcom's AI solution is at the heart of the split-second decision-making needed by AI-driven software and systems."", ""Broadcom is expected to report is fiscal first-quarter operating results in about a month. Don't be surprised if it follows in Walmart's footsteps and becomes the second brand-name stock-split stock of 2024."", 'Should you invest $1,000 in Walmart right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Walmart, consider this:', ""The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Walmart wasn't one of them.

Several years ago it represented a magical, enlightening moment for me, one of great sharing of my passion with [similar] people. So going back to school renews this feeling,” said De Vincenzo.', '“Only today I have the experience that I didn’t have back then and that I can now offer to people in the same way others did with me.

Topics will range from enhancing cultural identities to attention to environment and resources, as well as exploring the relationship between human touch and new technologies.', 'The latter include AI, which De Vincenzo recently experimented with. As reported earlier this week, he collaborated with digital artist and prompt designer Silvia Badalotti on creating the new, AI-generated advertising campaign for Etro.', '“AI looks scary because we don’t really know everything about it but we’ll learn to use it. I was very fascinated by it,” said De Vincenzo, mentioning that the project he worked on “showed me that the human figure remains fundamental in the process.”', '“AI is a medium like a camera or a computer, it’s nothing more than that. As far as I know, the filter of the human person that guided me into this parallel world was fundamental,” he added.', 'Olivia Spinelli, head of the IED Milano fashion school, praised De Vincenzo for bringing an interesting and “cultured vision of fashion, made up of a series of elements which he effectively transfers into the clothes and collections he designs.”', '“In addition to his creative standpoint, he is also extraordinary from a human point of view. A person with the right ability to listen and to interact empathically: great values, also in fashion,” added Spinelli.', 'In addition to overseeing the women’s, men’s and home collections for Etro since 2022, De Vincenzo still retains his role as head designer for leather goods at Fendi, which he first joined in 2000.', 'De Vincenzo launched his namesake label of womenswear in 2009, when he also won the Vogue Italia “Who Is on Next?” talent search competition and joined the Milan Fashion Week schedule.

But as you can see below, its revenue declined from $2.17 billion in the same quarter last year to $1.77 billion.

Steadily increasing DIO can be a warning sign that demand is weak, and if inventories continue to rise, the company may have to downsize production."", ""This quarter, Microchip Technology's DIO came in at 185, which is 51 days above its five-year average, suggesting that the company's inventory has grown to higher levels than we've seen in the past."", ""It was good to see Microchip Technology beat analysts' EPS expectations this quarter. That stood out as a positive in these results. On the other hand, its revenue guidance for next quarter missed analysts' expectations and its inventory levels increased. Management noted it is seeing weak demand as customers are overflowing with inventory. To cope with the lower sales outlook, Microchip plans to limit discretionary spending and tightly manage its inventory levels. In March and June, the company intends to have a two-week shutdown of its large wafer fabrication facilities. It will also reduce activity in many other factories, resulting in underutilization charges. Overall, the results could have been better.

We appreciate you joining us for MetLife's Fourth Quarter 2023 Earnings and Near-Term Outlook Call. Before we begin, I point you to the information on non-GAAP measures on the Investor Relations portion of metlife.com in our earnings release and in our quarterly financial supplements, which you should review. On the call this morning are Michel Khalaf, President and Chief Executive Officer; and John McCallion, Chief Financial Officer. Also participating in the discussion are other members of senior management.Last night, we released a set of supplemental slides, which address the quarter as well as our near-term outlook. They are available on our website. John McCallion will speak to those supplemental slides in his prepared remarks. An appendix to the slides features outlook sensitivities, disclosures, GAAP reconciliations and other information which you should also review. After prepared remarks, we will have a Q&A session which will end promptly at the top of the hour. As a reminder, please limit yourself to one question and one follow-up.With that, over to Michel."", 'Michel Abbas Khalaf', ""Thank you, John, and good morning, everyone. As we begin 2023, I shared our conviction that despite the uncertain times, MetLife would exit the year stronger than we entered it. We accomplished this by countering the challenging environment with the actions we've taken to focus, simplify and differentiate our business. We maintained an accelerated momentum in MetLife's diversified set of market-leading businesses driving strong results for the year and the quarter. And we illustrated our financial strength and flexibility with sound transactions and well-timed capital management ending the year with solid capital ratios and robust cash on hand. Clearly, our all-weather strategy stood up again in 2023. We remain steadfastly focused on what matters most in delivering for our customers and shareholders.In 2023, we exited a pandemic and have yet to enter a widely expected U.S. recession. We managed through a bank liquidity crisis and the resulting credit concerns, and we adapted to an inverted yield curve that has persisted longer than any in history. Against this backdrop, the fundamentals of our businesses are as strong as I have ever seen. Our successful 2023 is a testament to the resilience and durability of our business model, a relentless focus on execution, concentrating on the factors we control, our risk management culture and processes, the discipline we apply to managing our assets and liabilities, and the prudence of our investment portfolio. On that last point, the strength and stability of our commercial real estate portfolio, which we detailed a year ago, has borne out, as we said, a modest increase in LTVs and stable debt service coverage ratios, and we expect that to remain true in 2024.For the year, we delivered an adjusted return on equity, excluding notable items, of 13.8%, achieving our target for this all-important metric. We were unwavering in our expense discipline, employing efficiency and agility to post a full year direct expense ratio of 12.2%. We upheld our commitment to responsible growth, directing capital to its highest and best use with high-teen IRRs and mid single-digit payback periods on new business. We returned $4.7 billion to shareholders via common stock dividends and share repurchases, and we continue to generate strong recurring free cash flow and remain financially flexible with significant liquidity at our holding companies. The resilience of our strategy and the clarity of our purpose remain powerful drivers of MetLife's success. Our diversified portfolio of market-leading businesses is well positioned to perform for years to come. Backed by a strong balance sheet and our demonstrated ability to generate cash flow, I am confident in MetLife's ability to create value for shareholders and other stakeholders and to deliver financial security to our customers as we have for over a century and a half.Now turning to our fourth quarter 2023 results. Last night, we reported quarterly adjusted earnings of $1.4 billion or $1.83 per share. Excluding notable items, we reported $1.93 per share, up 21% compared to $1.59 per share a year ago. Again, this quarter, our businesses showed strong underlying momentum with excellent underwriting results. Also, our recurring investment income grew on higher balances and higher new money rates. Shifting to the full year 2023, the differentiation and scale across our market-leading businesses were among the factors that helped fuel our underlying business fundamentals. We generated adjusted earnings, excluding notable items, of $5.6 billion. On the strength of new money yields, our adjusted net investment income grew 9% year-over-year to almost $20 billion despite variable investment income falling below expectations. Adjusted PFOs, excluding pension risk transfers, climbed 6% with healthy growth across most business segments.Group Benefits posted adjusted earnings excluding notable items of $1.6 billion, up 22% from the prior year. The scale and breadth of this franchise business continues to drive organic growth and represents a clear point of competitive advantage. Sales gained 9% while adjusted PFOs, excluding the impact of participating policies, rose roughly 5%. We believe group PFO growth is sustainable at more than $1 billion per year. Higher interest rates serve as a tailwind to our leading Retirement and Income Solutions business with new money yields exceeding roll-off rates for the past 7 consecutive quarters. Volume growth in RIS away from PRT was very strong with more than $5 billion of longevity reinsurance sales and more than $3 billion of structured settlements. Pension risk transfers totaled $5.3 billion for the year, the third largest annual total in MetLife's history. This followed an all-time record year in 2022, and we have a strong pipeline of new opportunities in '24 and beyond.Sales growth in Asia remains strong, propelled by market demand in Japan for FX-denominated life insurance products and a new cash value life product in Korea. Finally, Latin America continues to be a growing and important region for MetLife. Adjusted earnings on a reported basis in 2023 grew 15% over the prior year, and we've expanded our distribution capabilities as well as our product portfolio. One of the ways we hold ourselves accountable is against the Next Horizon commitments we made in 2019. On that basis, we are ahead of schedule to meet all criteria. In fact, we have even moved the goalpost on ourselves and raised the bar on certain of our Next Horizon commitments. For instance, we initially committed to an adjusted return on equity of 12% to 14% and last year, we chose to push that target even higher to 13% to 15%. And as you've seen within our outlook disclosure, we further tightened our expense ratio target from 12.6% to 12.3%. While we have the strongest conviction in our Next Horizon strategy, we do not view it as a ceiling on our aspirations. We constantly look to set higher standards and position MetLife for even greater success.When I spoke of emerging from 2023 stronger, our capital and cash is another prime example. During the year marked by periods of financial and geopolitical turmoil, our balance sheet strength enabled us to repurchase $3.1 billion of our common stock and increase our common stock dividend per share, paying out roughly $1.6 billion in common stock dividends. Even still, we enter 2024 with robust levels of cash and higher capital ratios in our key markets. Our capital management has carried into 2024, and we have repurchased roughly $0.5 billion of net common shares in the month of January. We continue to have capacity for further action with approximately $1.6 billion remaining on our repurchase authorization. There is no doubt MetLife's financial strength and financial flexibility was on full view during 2023, particularly with the execution of our $19 billion risk transfer transaction that closed in November. This will free up more than $3 billion of capital over time and illustrates the disciplined approach we apply to evaluating our portfolio of businesses.We ended the year with $5.2 billion of cash and liquid assets on our balance sheet which is comfortably above our target cash buffer of $3 billion to $4 billion. We have consistently said that when responsible growth is attractive and available, we will deploy capital organically or inorganically. If not, we will return capital to our shareholders. I am pleased our Next Horizon strategy continues to prove its mettle amid uncertainty. Looking ahead, whether driven by Fed policy and changes to the yield curve, geopolitical events or the unfolding U.S. election cycle, it is prudent to anticipate more uncertainty in 2024. The supplemental slides we published last night include some near-term targets and elements of guidance. It should be plain to see that we anticipate the underlying momentum building across our businesses to continue. This is evident in our flagship Group Benefits business where of a large embedded base we've established a strong growth outlook for premium fees and other revenues. And on further note, we've also increased our expectations for both Group Life and Non-Medical Health margins. Importantly, the outlook that we've provided reflects the world as we see it, not as we wish it to be. In that context, we assume a more modest private equity return of high single digits in the near term, down from the 12% assumption we have used in prior years. Private equity remains an important contributor to our well-tested asset liability matching program. It is an asset class well suited to diffuse long-term liabilities and our historical track record has been very strong.In closing, when we launched our Next Horizon strategy in 2019, we could not have predicted the many challenges we would face in the markets where we operate. But our unyielding execution against our strategy is serving us and our many stakeholders well, allowing us to positively impact our customers and live our purpose. Our 2023 results reflect our capacity to move ahead with urgency and deliver on our strategy. We saw very good underlying business performance, supported by a strong capital base. We will continue to concentrate on controlling what we can control, balance sheet security, responsible growth, expense efficiency and capital deployment among others. In the final year of the Next Horizon strategy time frame, we believe our past progress positions us to reach for new heights not possible 4 years ago. I am energized for the future of MetLife driven by the continued momentum I see building in our businesses for 2024 and beyond.Now I'll turn it over to John to cover our performance and outlook in detail."", 'John Dennis McCallion', ""Thank you, Michel, and good morning. I will start with the 4Q '23 supplemental slides, which provide highlights of our financial performance, an update of our liquidity and capital positions as well as our commercial mortgage loan portfolio. In addition, I will discuss our near-term outlook in more detail. Starting on Page 3, we provide a comparison of net income to adjusted earnings in the fourth quarter and full year of 2023. Market risk benefit or MRB remeasurement losses in the fourth quarter was due to the decline in long-term interest rates. Net derivative gains were only a partial offset as the favorable impact from lower long-term interest rates were mitigated by changes in short-term interest rates and higher equity markets in the quarter. For the full year, the variance between net income and adjusted earnings was mostly attributable to net derivative losses, primarily due to stronger equity markets, changes in foreign currencies and higher interest rates in 2023. In addition, net investment losses were largely the result of normal trading activity on the portfolio in a rising interest rate environment as well as the mark-to-market impact on securities that were transferred as part of the reinsurance transaction with Global Atlantic. Overall, the portfolio remains well positioned with modest levels of credit losses and the hedging program continues to perform as expected.On Page 4, you can see the fourth quarter year-over-year comparison of adjusted earnings by segment, excluding $76 million after tax, of an unfavorable notable item relating to asbestos litigation reserves in 4Q of '23 that was accounted for in Corporate & Other. There were no notable items in the prior year quarter. Regarding the asbestos reserve increase of $76 million, based on our latest review, while we continue to observe a declining claim count, the frequency of severe claims related to asbestos has not declined as expected. The total reserve is $364 million at the end of 2023. Adjusted earnings, excluding total notable items were $1.4 billion, up 14% and 12% on a constant currency basis. The primary drivers were strong recurring interest margins, higher variable investment income, or VII, volume growth and favorable underwriting margins. Adjusted earnings per share, excluding total notable items were $1.93, up 21% and 19% on a constant currency basis.Moving to the businesses. Group Benefits adjusted earnings were $466 million, up 19% versus the prior year period. The key drivers were favorable life underwriting margins and solid volume growth. The Group Life mortality ratio was 83.5%, favorable to the prior year quarter of 87.3% and below the bottom end of our 2023 target range of 85% to 90%. Consistent with CDC U.S. mortality data, we saw a much lower number of life claims than typical in the fourth quarter. Regarding Non-Medical Health, the interest-adjusted benefit ratio was 70.7% in the quarter, and at the low end of its annual target range of 70% to 75%. We expect both the life mortality ratio and the Non-Medical Health ratio to be higher in Q1 given the seasonality of the business.Turning to the top line, Group Benefits adjusted PFOs on a full year basis were up 3% year-over-year. Taking participating contracts into account, which dampened growth by roughly 200 basis points, the underlying PFOs were up approximately 5% year-over-year within our 2023 target growth range of 4% to 6%. In addition, Group Benefits 2023 sales were up 9% year-over-year. The continued strong growth is primarily due to solid growth across most products, including continued strong momentum in voluntary. RIS adjusted earnings were $421 million, up 10% year-over-year. The primary drivers were favorable investment margins due to higher recurring interest and variable investment income, as well as favorable underwriting margins. RIS investment spreads were 121 basis points. Spreads, excluding VII were 134 basis points, up 10 points versus Q4 of '22, primarily due to higher interest rates as well as income from in-the-money interest rate caps. RIS adjusted PFOs, excluding pension risk transfers were up 75% year-over-year, primarily driven by strong sales of structured settlement products and post-retirement benefits, as well as growth in U.K. longevity reinsurance. With regards to PRT, we added transactions worth approximately $1.9 billion in the fourth quarter, bringing our full year total to roughly $5.3 billion. This marks the third highest PRT sales year for MetLife, and we continue to see an active market.Moving to Asia. Adjusted earnings were $296 million, up 12% and 11% on a constant currency basis, primarily due to higher investment margins and lower taxes. For Asia's key growth metrics, general account assets under management on an amortized cost basis were up 6% year-over-year on a constant currency basis, and sales were essentially flat versus the prior year quarter. For the full year, Asia sales were up 13%, driven by strong growth across the region, exceeding its 2023 guidance range of mid- to high-single digits. Latin America adjusted earnings were $207 million, up 13% and 4% on a constant currency basis, primarily due to solid volume growth, partially offset by less favorable underwriting margins versus a strong Q4 '22. In addition, LATAM had favorable Chilean encaje returns of 7.9% in 4Q of '23 versus 6.1% in the prior year quarter. Latin America's top line continues to perform well as adjusted PFOs were up 29% and 19% on a constant currency basis, driven by strong sales and solid persistency across the region. For the full year, adjusted PFOs were also up 29% on a reported basis and 19% on a constant currency basis exceeding LatAm's 2023 guidance of low double-digit growth.EMEA adjusted earnings were $47 million, down 27% on both a reported and constant currency basis, primarily driven by an unfavorable tax charge following a favorable tax benefit in the prior year period, as well as less favorable expense and underwriting margins. This was partially offset by higher recurring interest margins year-over-year. EMEA full year 2023 adjusted earnings of $265 million exceeded our outlook expectations of roughly $55 million per quarter. EMEA adjusted PFOs were up 5% on both a reported and constant currency basis, and sales were up 18% on a constant currency basis, reflecting strong growth across the region. MetLife Holdings adjusted earnings were $156 million, down 15%, largely driven by foregone earnings as a result of the reinsurance transaction that closed in November. Corporate and other adjusted loss was $156 million, excluding the unfavorable notable item of $76 million after tax that I referenced earlier. This compares to an adjusted loss of $210 million in the prior year. Higher net investment income and favorable taxes were the primary drivers. The company's effective tax rate on adjusted earnings in the quarter was approximately 19%, which includes favorable tax benefits, primarily related to the true-up of the federal tax return to provision.On Page 5, this chart reflects our pretax variable investment income for the 4 quarters and full year of 2023. VII was $63 million in the fourth quarter, primarily driven by positive returns in our corporate and mortgage loan funds. The private equity portfolio and real estate equity funds had a combined return of essentially 0 in the quarter. For the full year, VII was $419 million, well below our 2023 target of approximately $2 billion. That said, while mark-to-market returns were below expectation in 2023, the PE portfolio generated approximately $2 billion in cash distributions during the year. On Page 6, we provide VII post-tax by segment for the prior 4 quarters and full year 2023. As reflected in the chart, RIS, Asia and MetLife Holdings continue to hold the largest proportion of VII assets given their long-dated liability profile.Now turning to Page 7. The chart on the left of the page shows the split of our net investment income between recurring and VII for the past 3 years as well as Q4 of '22 versus Q4 of '23. While VII has had lower than trend returns over the last couple of years, recurring income, which accounted for most of the net investment income in 2023 was up approximately $2.6 billion year-over-year, reflecting higher interest rates and growth in asset balances. The expansion of recurring income in 2023 more than offset the lower VII year-over-year. Shifting your attention to the right of the page, which shows our new money yield versus roll-off yield since 4Q of '20. New money yields continue to outpace roll-off yields over the past couple of years, consistent with rising rates. In this quarter, our global new money yield continued its upward trajectory coming in at 6.67%, 142 basis points higher than the roll-off yield. Turning to Page 8. I'll provide a few updates on our commercial mortgage loans. Overall, the CML portfolio continues to perform consistent with expectations where we expect higher quality assets to outperform the asset sector broadly. The average LTV on our CML portfolio now stands at 64% as of December 31, up slightly from 63% in the third quarter of '23 and the average debt service coverage ratio remains steady at 2.3x. The modest increase in LTVs and stable debt service coverage ratio are further indicators of the disciplined approach we take to investing in this asset class. The quality of our CML portfolio remains strong with only 2.6% of loans having LTVs more than 80% and DSCRs less than 1x. With regard to CML loan maturities, we resolved 100% of the loans that were scheduled to mature in 2023. Our expectation going forward remains for modest credit losses on the portfolio. Turning to Page 9. This chart shows the comparison of our direct expense ratio over the prior 8 quarters and full year 2022 and 2023. Our direct expense ratio in 4Q of '23 was up modestly at 12.4%, reflecting the impact from seasonal enrollment costs in Group Benefits, as well as higher employee-related costs. That said, as we have highlighted previously, we believe our full year direct expense ratio is the best way to measure performance due to fluctuations in quarterly results. For the full year of 2023, our direct expense ratio was 12.2%, below our 2023 target of 12.6%. We believe this result once again demonstrates our consistent execution and focus on an efficiency mindset in a challenging inflationary environment while continuing to make investments in our businesses. I will now discuss our cash and capital positions on Page 10. Cash and liquid assets at the holding companies were approximately $5.2 billion at December 31, which is above our target cash buffer of $3 billion to $4 billion. The cash at the holding companies reflects the net effects of subsidiary dividends, payment of our common stock dividend, share repurchases of roughly $900 million in the fourth quarter as well as holding company expenses and other cash flows. In addition, we repurchased shares totaling approximately $500 million in January. For the 2-year period 2022 and 2023, our average free cash flow ratio excluding notable items totaled 74% and was within our 65% to 75% target range. In terms of statutory capital for our U.S. companies, our combined 2023 NAIC RBC ratio is still preliminary, but expected to be approximately 400% and above our 360% target. For our U.S. companies, preliminary 2023 statutory operating earnings were approximately $4.5 billion, while net income was approximately $3.9 billion. Statutory operating earnings increased by approximately $1.9 billion year-over-year, primarily driven by favorable underwriting and impacts from the reinsurance transaction. This was partially offset by higher expenses. We estimate that our total U.S. statutory adjusted capital was approximately $19.5 billion as of December 31, 2023, up 10% from September 30, 2023, primarily due to operating earnings and the impact of the reinsurance transaction. This was partially offset by dividends paid. Finally, we expect that Japan solvency margin ratio to be approximately 720% as of December 31, and which will be based on statutory statements that we filed in the next few weeks. Before I shift to our near-term outlook, starting on Page 12, a few points on what we included in the appendix. The chart on Page 17 reflects new business value metrics for MetLife's major segments from 2018 through 2022. This is the same chart that we showed as part of our 3Q '23 supplemental slides, but we feel it's worth including, again, for the sake of completeness. Also, Pages 18 through 21 provide interest rate assumptions and key outlook sensitivities by line of business.Now let's turn to Page 12 for further details on our near-term outlook. Starting with the overview. We expect continued uncertainty to persist around inflation and unemployment in 2024. We expect the U.S. dollar to stabilize around current levels. Based on the 12/31/23 forward curve, we assume long-term interest rates to be largely unchanged in 2024, and the yield curve will move from inverted to modestly upward sloping as short-term interest rates decline, and we assume a 5% annual return for the S&P 500. For our near-term targets, we are maintaining our adjusted ROE range of 13% to 15%. We expect to maintain our 2-year average free cash flow ratio of 65% to 75% of adjusted earnings. Also, given continued focus on expense discipline, building capacity to reinvest in growth initiatives and our overall efficiency mindset, we are lowering our direct expense ratio guidance for 2024 from 12.6% to 12.3%. Specifically for 2024, VII expected to be approximately $1.5 billion. Our Corporate & Other adjusted loss target is expected to be $750 million to $850 million after tax in 2024. This represents an approximate $100 million increase from our prior adjusted loss guidance of $650 million to $750 million in 2023. The higher range reflects C&O's current run rate, given the impact of a higher rate environment on interest expense and pension costs as well as the impact of lower expected benefits from VII. We are increasing our expected effective tax rate range by 2 points to 24% to 26% to reflect our expectation for higher earnings in foreign markets with higher tax rates and lower tax credits in the U.S. At the bottom of the page, you will see certain interest rate sensitivities relative to our base case, reflecting a relatively modest impact on adjusted earnings over the near term. On Page 13, the chart reflects our VII average asset balances from $18 billion in 2022 to $19.7 billion expected in 2024. Private equity investments will continue to represent the vast majority of our VII asset balances. We are reducing our near-term expected annual return for private equity to be between 7% to 10%. And we are also lowering our expected returns for real estate and other funds to be in the range of 5% to 7% over the near term. We expect PE and real estate returns will remain pressured in the first quarter of '24 before trending higher. Finally, as a reminder, we include prepayment fees on fixed maturities and mortgage loans in VII. So now I will discuss our near-term outlook for our business segments. Let's start with the U.S. on Page 14. For Group Benefits, excluding the excess premium from participating Group Life contracts of approximately $300 million in 2023, adjusted PFOs are expected to grow at 4% to 6% annually over the near term. And for 2024, we expect growth to be in the top half of that range. This reflects the strong momentum in the business, particularly in voluntary products as well as exceptionally strong persistency in our national accounts. Regarding underwriting, we expect 2024 underwriting margins to be generally consistent with 2023. As such, we are reducing our near-term Group Life mortality ratio and Non-Medical Health interest-adjusted benefit ratio ranges by 1 percentage point to 84% to 89% and 69% to 74%, respectively. Finally, keep in mind, these are annual ratios and both typically skew to the higher end of the ranges in the first quarter given the seasonality of the business. For RIS, we are maintaining our 2% to 4% expected annual growth for total liability exposures across our general account spread and fee-based businesses. Regarding investment spread, full year 2023 was 125 basis points and is expected to be relatively flat for the full year of 2024. This incorporates both the impact of the roll-off of our interest rate caps with maturities throughout 2024 and the offsetting benefit of VII reemerging over the year as a more meaningful contributor. As such, we expect the investment spread range for 2024 is 115 to 140 basis points. We have also provided updated RIS sensitivities for interest rate movements in the appendix. Sensitivities reflect the anticipated impact from interest rate cap maturities throughout 2024. As such, our sensitivity to (inaudible) declines throughout the year. For MetLife Holdings, we are expecting adjusted PFOs to decline by approximately 13% to 15% in 2024 and then declining 4% to 6% annually thereafter. And we are lowering the adjusted earnings guidance range to $700 million to $900 million in 2024 to reflect the foregone earnings from the reinsurance transaction as well as lower expected PE returns and natural runoff of the business. Now let's look at the near-term guidance of our businesses outside the U.S. on Page 15. For Asia, we expect the recent sales momentum to continue and generate mid single-digit growth over the near term. In addition, we expect general account AUM to maintain mid single-digit growth. We are expecting adjusted earnings to grow roughly 20% in 2024 as we assume VII to have a greater impact throughout the year. We are maintaining mid single-digit adjusted earnings growth expectation over the remainder of the near term. For Latin America, we expect both adjusted PFOs and adjusted earnings to grow by high single digits over the near term. Finally, for EMEA, we are expecting sales to grow mid- to high-single digits and adjusted PFOs to grow mid-single digits over the near term. The forward curve assumes a strengthening of the U.S. dollar relative to most currencies in EMEA. As such, we project EMEA's adjusted earnings run rate to be roughly $60 million to $65 million per quarter in 2024. And and then grow by mid-single digits in 2025 and 2026 based on the forward curve for these currencies. Let me conclude by saying that MetLife delivered a solid quarter to close out another strong year. The underlying strength of our business fundamentals remains on display with strong top line growth, coupled with disciplined underwriting and expense management. While VII remains below historical returns, core spreads remain robust, and continue to benefit from the higher yield environment. While the current environment remains uncertain, we are excited about the outlook and growth prospects for our businesses over the near term and beyond. MetLife continues to move forward from a position of strength with a strong balance sheet, recurring free cash flow generation and a diversified set of our market-leading businesses. And we are committed to deploying capital to achieve responsible growth and build sustainable value for our customers and our shareholders. And with that, I will turn the call back to the operator for your questions."", 'Operator', '(Operator Instructions). Our first question is from Ryan Krueger with KBW.', 'Ryan Joel Krueger', ""My first question is on the ROE target. And I recognize that you just raised the target by 100 basis points a year ago to 13% to 15%, but it seems like your segment outlook would suggest something at least a bit above 15%, maybe something closer to 15.5%. So I guess I just wanted to hear your perspective on -- am I thinking about that incorrectly or is there some potential upside to this ROE based on the current trends you're seeing?"", 'John Dennis McCallion', ""Ryan, it's John. I think we wouldn't debate your model calculations there. I think it's fair to say that -- we certainly are trending to the high end of that range, if not with a plus sign, but we just moved it a year ago, and I think we'll take a year here and take stock at that time. But I'd say -- I think maybe just to help you with that, one other thing is it's -- like I said, we'll take stock. We think over time, and we've been talking about this, that there has been kind of -- as a result of higher rates, there has been a shift in volume and returns on our business. So it wouldn't preclude us from doing it again. We just -- I think we want to take some time to take stock."", 'Ryan Joel Krueger', 'Understood. Makes sense. And then I think you said that you expected the RBC ratio to be around 400%. I would have thought it would have been maybe a little higher than that following the reinsurance transaction. Do you have any more color on it if there are any offsets?', 'John Dennis McCallion', ""Yes, I think when we announced the deal, we thought this would give us 50 to 60 points. We still think it will and it's little bit of what happens immediately and then how things tread in over time. Also, there's a lot of other things going on, fungibility, growth. We had some very sizable growth in RIS. So we've deployed some extra capital this year. So I think a lot of those things. But in terms of the deal economics that we outlined at the time of signing, everything came in as expected."", 'Operator', 'Next, we go to the line of Suneet Kamath with Jefferies.', 'Suneet Laxman L. Kamath', ""Appreciate all the color on the guidance. But maybe if we could just circle back to consolidated recurring NII. I think you talked about a pretty big lift in '23 relative to '22, that $19.3 billion. Any help in terms of what you think that could look like given all the moving pieces as we think about 2024?"", 'John Dennis McCallion', ""Suneet, it's John. It's a good question. I mean, sometimes NII, it's a helpful metric certainly from, I'd say, mix and just to show that higher rates have more than offset or actually offset some of the depression in VII. And I think the point of that slide is to show that we -- there's more power there once things kind of reemerge on the VII front. Sometimes it's a little hard with just translating NII to earnings. So we're a little cautious on this given the target around that because we have different products that perform well in different environments and ultimately spread. So I think we're a little hesitant to kind of forecast for you. I think the point of that slide was to indicate that it shows the growth in our business. It shows that we're well diversified. We can perform well in a variety of economic environments. And I think that's really the -- probably the theme to take away. So sorry, I didn't get to maybe your exact question -- answer, but that's probably the best I can do."", 'Suneet Laxman L. Kamath', ""Okay. Got it. And then as we think about the benefit in the caps in '23 and what that looks like in '24 as they roll off, should we think about the improvement in VII is essentially like those 2 kind of net as a wash? Or is one kind of greater than the other? I just want to get some additional color on that, if we could."", 'John Dennis McCallion', ""Yes, it's a great question. I think what you just said at the end around -- in terms of them being a wash is a pretty good way of thinking about it. So we had 125 basis points last year all-in for 2023. We gave a range of 115 bps to 140 bps for next year. I think the midpoint is a little above 127 bps, I guess, if you did the math. And our view is, yes, there's -- the interest rate cash will roll off throughout the year, and then VII will emerge throughout the year and essentially offset the decline there. And so we think the best way to think about the spreads for the year is relatively flat to what you saw for the full year of '23. It will give and take here and there. As we point out on the slide, we think VII in the first quarter will continue to be pressured. Obviously, the caps haven't fully rolled off yet. So we'll have -- we'll still have income from them. And then as VII emerges, you'll see the caps roll off and they'll essentially offset."", 'Operator', 'Next, we have a question from Tom Gallagher with Evercore ISI.', 'Thomas George Gallagher', ""So your assumed alternative returns are now around 7.5% for '24 and I think the RBC risk charge, if I was to do a weighted average would be 15% to 20% on most of that portfolio. Have you considered pivoting some of the portfolio into assets with comparable, let's say, 7% yields like private credit or just other fixed income, but much lower risk charges. I'm just thinking about it from the perspective of -- we've had 2 years of underperformance. Your outlook for a third year is below those levels and rates are higher. And if I think about both your cost of capital and ROE, I think it would be a fairly meaningful positive, not -- recognizing you can't do this overnight, but is that something you consider pivoting or shifting to?"", 'John Dennis McCallion', ""Tom, it's John. I think the last point you made around you can't do this overnight is an important piece, but I think direction of travel, that's probably a fair point. And I think we've talked about the fact that -- we are in a different rate environment, so the relative value of investments are probably different than where they were when it was lower for longer. We pride ourselves in diversification. So it's not that we would make an abrupt shift, but we do believe that making some tweaks to allocations is appropriate in different environments. And that would -- I think what you're referencing is one that we would lean towards. We've had -- it's an asset class where you have prior commitments and those then get deployed judiciously and actually, there are probably some really good opportunities right now that we're leveraging. Having said that, we think distributions will likely outpace new contributions, just given our revised level of new commitments. And I think over time, you would see a moderate shift in allocation in that asset class versus others."", 'Thomas George Gallagher', ""Okay. And then just a question on Group Benefits. The 100 basis points improvement in the margin target or at least the loss ratio targets. Can you comment on what's driving that? Is that stable pricing, sustainably higher visibility or low visibility loss ratios and maybe a little bit on the Group Life side, what you're thinking?"", 'Ramy Tadros', ""Tom, it's Ramy here. And I would say, at the highest level in terms of our near-term outlook here is, this is driven by the change in business mix both in terms of the customer segments that we serve as well as the products that we offer. So from a customer perspective, we've executed well on our strategy to target higher growth in regional markets. We're seeing the benefits of that in terms of growth. Regional markets has grown 2 to 3 percentage points higher than the overall average, and we see a clear path for that growth to continue and regional market is a segment that does carry a lower loss ratio across both the life underwriting ratio on Non-Medical Health and we're also seeing a shift from a product perspective. We've executed well on our employee-paid strategy in general and voluntary strategy in particular. And in voluntary, we've seen double-digit growth over many years and we expect that to persist in the future given customer needs and the opportunity to drive penetration in the workplace. And the loss ratio here tends to be also more favorable to the overall portfolio. So between that customer segment and that product view, if you think about this over time, we feel kind of a shift to the outlook is warranted.Let me tell you what it's not been driven by. On the life ratio, this quarter was very favorable, and it's really driven, as John pointed out, to the population mortality experience. So this is not one quarter mix of trend. This is one quarter here that was favorable, and we do expect the Q1 numbers to tick up given the seasonality of life claims. And then on the disability side, our outlook in terms of the ratios does include an expectation and the profitability of our disability line of business will moderate over time, but that is outweighed by the other factors that I've just mentioned. And back to Q1 as well there, just remember, there's also seasonality in that ratio in Q1 given the seasonality of the dental business. So net-net, think about it as business mix customer and product mix that's really driving this shift downwards in the ranges."", 'Operator', 'Next, we go to the line of Jimmy Bhullar with JPMorgan.', 'Jamminder Singh Bhullar', ""So first question on retirement spreads. Can you discuss the driver of the sequential decline in spreads each for the last 2 quarters? And how much of this is being driven by mix of business versus maybe competition because what we're seeing is your yields have gone up, but the crediting rates seem to be rising even faster than that."", 'John Dennis McCallion', ""Jimmy, it's John. The simple answer just sequentially for us is, we just [developed] the lower rates late in the quarter caused a bit of compression on the spread number, just how the -- we had the caps in the money and lower rates came in. So it was different than the forward curve at the time of the third quarter when we gave the 135 to 140 range, came in at 134 ex VII. So that's the main driver. It's not pricing. Pricing has actually been pretty healthy, relatively speaking. We haven't seen any change in pricing. And so anything -- if anything, it's really just a simple change in the curve."", 'Jamminder Singh Bhullar', ""Okay. And then on the CRE portfolio, you mentioned resolving all of the maturities for '23. Can you give us a sense of how much of your book is coming due over the next 1 to 2 years, especially in office properties? And as you're resolving these loans, are you having to extend more of them than you've done in the past? Or are you resolving them similar to how you would have done it over the last several years?"", 'John Dennis McCallion', ""Yes, sure, Jimmy. It's John again. So just as a reminder, for 2023, just rough percentages of the resolution, about 30% was pay off or refinance. Another 60 was these contractual extensions where the borrowers have to be in good financial condition. We have some pretty high level of requirements there. So those are contractual if you're -- if you meet those requirements, then you have the right and they tend to be more floating rate nature loans where they're just waiting to lock in fixed rates. There's less than 10% on just, I would say, maturity extensions where we agree with the borrower. It's a good -- there's a good positive situation for us to extend, and then there's kind of a couple of points of foreclosures. In terms of 2024, about 10% of the balance comes due in terms of maturities, the overall PBO that we have. I'd say that -- in terms of resolutions, probably a similar mix to what we saw in terms of percentage. And I think in terms of -- we gave a little bit of magnitude this past year in terms of what we thought were at risk loans and level of charge-offs. Our view in 2024 is that we'd see a similar order of magnitude on both loans at risk and level of charge-offs as well."", 'Operator', 'Next, we go to the line of Elyse Greenspan with Wells Fargo.', 'Elyse Beth Greenspan', ""My first question is on the PRT side. I think we've stopped seeing, right, the seasonality where deals are much more weighted to the fourth quarter. So just trying to get a sense of your outlook for '24 and how we should think about the cadence of potential transactions there?"", 'Ramy Tadros', ""Elyse, it's Ramy here. I think you're right to point out kind of the -- we've seen less of that seasonality, we're seeing deals being done throughout the year. Our outlook there remains pretty positive. We continue to see a very healthy pipeline, in particular, a pipeline at the larger end of the market, where we are most competitive. And all the macro indicators in terms of what the plant sponsors are saying in terms of the funding level, the magnitude of assets sitting in frozen defined benefit plan, all kind of indicate expectations of continued kind of high level of activity in this market into '24. So no change in terms of our view of the robustness of the pipeline. And look, I mean, if you step back and look at RIS more broadly, the liability exposures are all -- are up 3% year-over-year. And most of that growth is coming from our spread earning general account business, which is actually growing at 4%. And that's coming off 2022 where we had the $8 billion PRT deal, and that growth is not just PRT. I mean, PRT was about $5.3 billion, but we're also seeing continued strength across a range of spread-based products, be it structured settlements and be it some of our products in our Risk Solutions business and so on."", 'Elyse Beth Greenspan', ""And then my second question, how should we think about dividends to parent that you guys could take in '24 as you could look to upstream the capital that you guys are getting from the holdings transaction?"", 'Michel Abbas Khalaf', ""Elyse, it's Michel. Thanks for the question. So we talked about the reinsurance transaction as providing us with significant financial flexibility. And as you heard from John, our RBC ratio is approximately 400%. And I would just note here that the 5.2% HoldCo cash does not yet include any of the reinsurance proceeds. So the excess capital is sitting in our statutory entities. And it will ultimately migrate to the HoldCo. We view excess capital as fungible, and we will redeploy it over time. And in the absence of attractive organic or inorganic growth opportunities, I think we've built a good track record in terms of being deliberate and expeditious post major divestitures and how we return capital to shareholders. And as you've seen since we closed on the transaction, we've leaned into buybacks with -- especially in January. I wouldn't sort of consider January as a monthly run rate for the full year, but we're going to continue to be opportunistic here. I hope that helps."", 'John Dennis McCallion', ""And I would just add, Elyse, I mean, just to kind of put a finer point on just the financial flexibility and the fungibility of that. I mean, we might -- because we have excess capital at the OpCo, we might think differently at the HoldCo, it will depend, right? I mean, I don't think we have to necessarily have it all at the HoldCo. We have a range of 3 to 4, it might give us some ability to manage more differently in that -- within that range because we have excess OpCo. So I think we just want to -- I think the flexibility is the key point."", 'Operator', 'Next, we go to the line of Alex Scott with Goldman Sachs.', 'Taylor Alexander Scott', ""First one I had is just going back to the VII guidance quickly. Could you frame for us how much of the lower VII guide, it is maybe a little more specific to first quarter VII and what you see in the results that you sort of already have eyes on since it's lagged as opposed to level setting like the ongoing expectation?"", 'John Dennis McCallion', ""Alex, it's John. I'd love to say that we have great insights into -- as a result of having the lag. But I'm not so sure that has proven out the way we thought it would each quarter. I think all we know is that we think -- we kind of believe that it will bump along the kind of the bottom again before becoming a more meaningful contributor in the outer quarters. We think managers -- even though the S&P jumped up in the quarter, it was kind of late in the quarter. We believe managers will be a bit cautious in their year-end remarks and maybe remain conservative before writing investments based on some of the public market multiples. So that's our -- that's kind of our base case assumption. We don't have a lot of insight yet in actual financial statements that have come through. So we'll -- obviously, those will come through as we move through the quarter."", 'Taylor Alexander Scott', ""Got it. Okay. That's helpful. Maybe for a second one, just on what you saw around pricing in Group Benefits, maybe in the U.S. and LatAm, around year-end enrollment and so forth, I mean, margins are really good. Are you seeing any competition that's starting to heat up there?"", 'Ramy Tadros', ""Thanks, Alex. It's Ramy here. I would say, we're really off to a strong start in '24. If you look at '23 overall sales were up 9% year-over-year, as John mentioned, and we saw a very strong persistency in line with our expectations. And we also saw the rate actions that we were able to take also in line with our expectations across market segments. So while there is competition, and it is a competitive market, when we think about pricing as well as persistency, I think all the nonprice factors of differentiations that we've talked about in the past are playing into our favor here and we've been able to hold margins and as you've seen, expanded the margin outlook. 1/1, I can give you a bit of a flavor on that. We're still in the midst of it. But initial indications in terms of our sales growth are in the 5% to 10% again year-over-year with really solid growth across the product portfolio, across both core and voluntary. So these are really good indicators for us both in terms of volume and margin as we look into '24."", 'Operator', 'And ladies and gentlemen, we have time for one last question from John Barnidge with Piper Sandler.', 'John Bakewell Barnidge', ""Maybe sticking with Group Benefits, can you maybe talk about growth in employee counts among your corporate partners, whether it's larger in the small or the jumbo end, maybe a viewpoint of 1/1 renewals with that?"", 'Ramy Tadros', ""John, I don't have that number handy specifically in terms of the employee count. The best thing you could look at for an indicator for that is just overall employment levels because we have a very diversified book up and down market. It's highly diversified by industry. So you could think of us as reflecting the broader economy in terms of our employee count. The one that I would look at more closely is, and this is where we see a lot of white space with respect to employee cost is the penetration rate in the workspace. We still see plenty of opportunity to drive penetration of our own products, be it voluntary or employee paid. And that's through the deployment of the right technology, the right tools, the right engagement capabilities and that's really what's been fueling our voluntary growth over the past few years, and that's where we see continued future growth opportunities."", 'John Bakewell Barnidge', ""My follow-up question. You talked about the frequency of asbestos claims hasn't declined as expected. Can you maybe talk about that versus what the assumption was?"", 'John Dennis McCallion', ""Yes. John, it's John. So as we said, this is something that we look at each third and fourth quarter where we conduct our experience study and this is an exposure where there is a declining claim count, but what hasn't declined as expected or as fast as expected is some of the severe claims, so the larger claims. And that's really what we trued up this quarter. Again, it's a kind of a runoff claim count exposure has -- we've been seeing that for some time. But in the last 12 months, we just saw a slightly different trend that we needed to adjust for. I mean, the overall reserves just above $350 million."", 'Operator', ""And I'll now turn the conference back to John Hall for closing remarks."", 'John Arthur Hall', 'Great. Thank you, operator, and thank you, everybody, for joining us this morning. Have a great day.', 'Operator', 'Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude your conference for today.

This upgrade is essentially a reflection of an upward trend in earnings estimates -- one of the most powerful forces impacting stock prices.', ""The Zacks rating relies solely on a company's changing earnings picture. It tracks EPS estimates for the current and following years from the sell-side analysts covering the stock through a consensus measure -- the Zacks Consensus Estimate."", 'Since a changing earnings picture is a powerful factor influencing near-term stock price movements, the Zacks rating system is very useful for individual investors. They may find it difficult to make decisions based on rating upgrades by Wall Street analysts, as these are mostly driven by subjective factors that are hard to see and measure in real time.', 'Therefore, the Zacks rating upgrade for Gartner basically reflects positivity about its earnings outlook that could translate into buying pressure and an increase in its stock price.', 'Most Powerful Force Impacting Stock Prices', ""The change in a company's future earnings potential, as reflected in earnings estimate revisions, has proven to be strongly correlated with the near-term price movement of its stock. That's partly because of the influence of institutional investors that use earnings and earnings estimates for calculating the fair value of a company's shares. An increase or decrease in earnings estimates in their valuation models simply results in higher or lower fair value for a stock, and institutional investors typically buy or sell it. Their bulk investment action then leads to price movement for the stock."", ""For Gartner, rising earnings estimates and the consequent rating upgrade fundamentally mean an improvement in the company's underlying business. And investors' appreciation of this improving business trend should push the stock higher."", 'Harnessing the Power of Earnings Estimate Revisions', 'Empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock movements, so it could be truly rewarding if such revisions are tracked for making an investment decision. Here is where the tried-and-tested Zacks Rank stock-rating system plays an important role, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions.', ""The Zacks Rank stock-rating system, which uses four factors related to earnings estimates to classify stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), has an impressive externally-audited track record, with Zacks Rank #1 stocks generating an average annual return of +25% since 1988.

Irrespective of market conditions, only the top 5% of the Zacks-covered stocks get a 'Strong Buy' rating and the next 15% get a 'Buy' rating.

(NASDAQ:ALGN) shareholders, because the company has just released its latest annual results, and the shares gained 3.4% to US$273. Align Technology reported in line with analyst predictions, delivering revenues of US$3.9b and statutory earnings per share of US$5.81, suggesting the business is executing well and in line with its plan. The analysts typically update their forecasts at each earnings report, and we can judge from their estimates whether their view of the company has changed or if there are any new concerns to be aware of. Readers will be glad to know we've aggregated the latest statutory forecasts to see whether the analysts have changed their mind on Align Technology after the latest results."", ' Check out our latest analysis for Align Technology ', ""After the latest results, the 15 analysts covering Align Technology are now predicting revenues of US$4.05b in 2024. If met, this would reflect an okay 4.8% improvement in revenue compared to the last 12 months. Statutory earnings per share are predicted to jump 24% to US$7.23. In the lead-up to this report, the analysts had been modelling revenues of US$4.06b and earnings per share (EPS) of US$7.18 in 2024. So it's pretty clear that, although the analysts have updated their estimates, there's been no major change in expectations for the business following the latest results."", ""The consensus price target rose 8.6% to US$308despite there being no meaningful change to earnings estimates. It could be that the analystsare reflecting the predictability of Align Technology's earnings by assigning a price premium. There's another way to think about price targets though, and that's to look at the range of price targets put forward by analysts, because a wide range of estimates could suggest a diverse view on possible outcomes for the business. Currently, the most bullish analyst values Align Technology at US$344 per share, while the most bearish prices it at US$215. As you can see, analysts are not all in agreement on the stock's future, but the range of estimates is still reasonably narrow, which could suggest that the outcome is not totally unpredictable."", ""These estimates are interesting, but it can be useful to paint some more broad strokes when seeing how forecasts compare, both to the Align Technology's past performance and to peers in the same industry. We would highlight that Align Technology's revenue growth is expected to slow, with the forecast 4.8% annualised growth rate until the end of 2024 being well below the historical 15% p.a. growth over the last five years. By way of comparison, the other companies in this industry with analyst coverage are forecast to grow their revenue at 8.0% per year. So it's pretty clear that, while revenue growth is expected to slow down, the wider industry is also expected to grow faster than Align Technology."", ""The most obvious conclusion is that there's been no major change in the business' prospects in recent times, with the analysts holding their earnings forecasts steady, in line with previous estimates. Fortunately, the analysts also reconfirmed their revenue estimates, suggesting that it's tracking in line with expectations. Although our data does suggest that Align Technology's revenue is expected to perform worse than the wider industry. We note an upgrade to the price target, suggesting that the analysts believes the intrinsic value of the business is likely to improve over time."", ""With that said, the long-term trajectory of the company's earnings is a lot more important than next year.

For Q4, total revenues were up 6.1% year-over-year, reflecting increased Systems and Services revenues. Strength in Clear Aligner volumes for teens and international doctors as well as continued growth from Invisalign touch-up cases, under our Invisalign Doctor Subscription Program, or DSP. Our Q4 Systems and Services revenues were up year-over-year, primarily due to increased services, CAD/CAM and nonsystems revenues, including scanner leasing and rental programs and certified preowned scanner sales. Q4 total Clear Aligner shipments were slightly lower year-over-year. On a year-over-year basis, Clear Aligner volumes were down for the Americas and EMEA regions and were up for the APAC region.', ""For Q4, Clear Aligner shipments include approximately 20,000 Invisalign DSP touch-up cases, primarily in North America, an increase of more than 60% year-over-year from Q4 '22. DSP continues to be well received by our customers and is currently available in the U.S. and Canada, Iberia and Nordics and most recently, the U.K. We're excited that DSP is proving helpful to doctors and their patients as we continue to expand the program. For fiscal 2023, total Invisalign DSP touch-up cases shipped were 73,000, up 85% year-over-year. For non-case revenues, Q4 was up 13.3% year-over-year, primarily due to continued growth from Vivera Retainers along with Invisalign DSP retainer revenues. On a sequential basis, Q4 total revenues were down slightly, 0.4%, primarily reflecting anticipated seasonally lower teens case starts, especially in the U.S. ortho channel and unfavorable foreign exchange offset somewhat by increased revenues from System and Services as well as an increase in Clear Aligner volume for adults and noncomprehensive cases and stronger volumes from Canada and the EMEA region."", 'Q4 total Aligner shipments were slightly lower sequentially.

The December gauge practice analysis tool that collects and consolidates data from approximately 1,000 orthodontic practices across the U.S. and Canada reported year-over-year decline for new patients, total exams and total starts, particularly among teens and kids. It also shows a year-over-year decline for wires and brackets and total Clear Aligner starts with Invisalign case starts better than the Clear Aligner brand. And the teen segment for Q4, a 197,000 teens and younger patients started treatment with Invisalign Clear Aligner Systems, up 6% year-over-year and were a record number of teen cases shipped compared to prior fourth quarters.', 'Q4 teens starts were down sequentially, consistent with historical seasonality, primarily in China as well as seasonally fewer teen starts in North America compared to Q3. For fiscal 2023, total Invisalign Clear Aligner shipments for teens and younger patients reached a total of 809,000 cases, up 8% compared to the prior year and made up 34% of total Clear Aligner shipments. During Q4, we announced that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration cleared the Invisalign Palatal Expander System, we call it IPE, Invisalign Palatal Expander for commercial availability in the United States. The FDA 510(k) clearance is for broad patient applicability, including growing children, teens and adults. Full early intervention treatments such as Phase I or early interceptive treatment, makes up about 20% of the orthodontic case starts each year and is growing.', 'Together with Invisalign First Aligners, IPEs provide doctors with a solution set to treat the most common skeletal, dental malocclusions in growing children. The addition of mandibular advancement features to Invisalign aligners also provides doctors with more options for treating skeletal, dental joint balances and bite correction and for their growing patients during their teenage years. Essentially, we now have an Invisalign digital treatment solution for every phase of treatment. IPE is currently available on a limited basis in Canada and the United States, and we recently received regulatory clearance in Australia and New Zealand where we anticipate commercialization in Q2. We expect IPE to be available in other markets pending future applicable regulatory approvals.', ""We're also launching ClinCheck smile video, the next generation of In-Face digitalization with AI-assisted video that is expected to be available to all doctors who use the Invisalign Practice App and ClinCheck treatment planning software. This new tool is designed to help improve patients' understanding and of the confidence in Invisalign treatment and is based on iTero Intraoral Scanner and doctors ClinCheck plan for Invisalign treatment. ClinCheck smile video simulates the doctor's ClinCheck treatment plan with a short video of a patient's face, and they talk and smile, which helps patients visualize their potential new smile and can lead to a higher patient treatment acceptance. We expect to roll out ClinCheck smile video in Q1 '24 in North America and EMEA, followed by APAC later in the year."", 'Before I turn the call over to John for our fourth quarter financial review, I want to share one more exciting news. Today, we introduced the latest innovation in the iTero family of inter-oral scanners. The iTero Lumina inter-oral scanner designed to meet the needs of doctors and their patients by offering smaller wand with unparalleled data capture capabilities for effortlessly scanning by clinical members. The iTero Lumina Inter-oral scanner is a breakthrough technology. With 3x wider field of capture and a 50% smaller wand that delivers faster scanning, higher accuracy and superior visualization for greater practice efficiency. iTero Lumina quickly, easily and accurately captures more data while delivering exceptionally scanned quality and photorealistic images that eliminate the need for inter-oral photos altogether.', 'Doctors can now scan at twice the speed with a wide field of capture, multi-angled scanning and large capture distance, meaning they can capture more dentition in greater detail throughout the scanning process. To date, Align has filed over 30 patent applications covering technology related to the iTero Lumina inter-oral scanner. I believe iTero Lumina has the potential to set a new standard of care for dental practices by simplifying the scanning of complex oral regions while offering superior chairside visualization and more comfortable experience for patients, especially kids. Initial doctor feedback has been very positive, noting that iTero Lumina scanner is much faster, clear, less invasive for their patients and the imaging and visualization translates to better communications and patient experience.', ""The iTero Lumina inter-oral scanner is available now with orthodontic workflows and will be available in the second half of 2024 restorative workflows, although we expect that GP practices can benefit now from the new scanning technology. A global broadcast to unveil iTero Lumina and provide attendees with insights and detailed information from our iTero team and early customer users is planned for February 15.

Before I go into the details, I want to note that during Q4 '23, we incurred a total of $14 million of restructuring and other charges, primarily related to post-employment benefits."", 'Q4 operating expenses were $498 million, roughly flat sequentially and down 1.4 points year-over-year. On a sequential basis, operating expenses were up slightly due -- primarily due to restructuring and other charges, offset by lower employee compensation. Year-over-year operating expenses decreased by $7.1 million primarily due to controlled spend on advertising and marketing as part of our efforts to proactively manage costs, partially offset by employee-related costs and slightly higher restructuring charges. On a non-GAAP basis, excluding stock-based compensation, restructuring and other charges and amortization of acquired intangibles related to certain acquisitions, operating expenses were $446.7 million, down 2.5% sequentially and down 2.8% year-over-year.', 'Our fourth quarter operating income of $171.5 million resulted in an operating margin of 17.9%, up 0.6 points sequentially and up 5.4 points year-over-year. Operating margin was unfavorably impacted by approximately 0.6 points sequentially primarily due to foreign exchange. The year-over-year increase in operating margin is primarily attributed to operating leverage and proactively managing our costs as well as favorable impact from foreign exchange by approximately 0.6 points. On a non-GAAP basis, which excludes stock-based compensation, restructuring and other charges, the amortization of intangibles related to certain acquisition, operating margin for the fourth quarter was 23.8%, up 2 points sequentially and up 5.5 points year-over-year.', 'Interest and other income and expense net for the fourth quarter was an income of $1.3 million compared to a loss of $4.2 million in the third quarter and income of $2.7 million in Q4 2022, primarily driven by favorable foreign exchange. The GAAP effective tax rate for the fourth quarter was 28.3%, higher than the third quarter effective tax rate of 25.1% and lower than the fourth quarter effective tax rate of 63.8% in the prior year. The fourth quarter GAAP effective tax rate was higher than the third quarter effective tax rate primarily due to onetime benefit related to tax guidance issued in Q3, partially offset by lower U.S. taxes on foreign earnings in Q4. As a reminder, in Q4 2022, we changed our methodology for the computation of our non-GAAP effective tax rate to a long-term projected tax rate and have given effect to the new methodology from January 1, 2022.', 'Our non-GAAP effective tax rate for the fourth quarter was 20%, reflecting the change in our methodology. Fourth quarter net income per share was $1.64, up sequentially $0.06 and up $1.10 compared to the prior year.

On a non-GAAP basis, net income per diluted share was $2.42 for the fourth quarter up $0.28 sequentially and up $0.69 year-over-year. Moving on to the balance sheet. As of December 31, 2023, cash, cash equivalents and short and long term marketable securities were $980.8 million, down sequentially $321.2 million and down $60.8 million year-over-year. Of our $980.8 million balance, $196.1 million was held in the U.S. and $784.7 million was held by our international entities.', ""In October 2023, we purchased approximately 1 million shares of our common stock at an average price of $190.56 per share through a $250 million Accelerated Share Repurchase.

We have $650 million remaining available for repurchase of our common stock under this stock repurchase program. Q4 accounts receivable balance was $903.4 million, slightly down sequentially. Our overall days sales outstanding was 85 days, flat sequentially and year-over-year. Cash flow from operations for the fourth quarter was $46.9 million."", 'Capital expenditures for the fourth quarter were $33.4 million, primarily related to our continued investments to increase aligner manufacturing capacity in facilities. Free cash flow, defined as cash flow from operations less capital expenditures, amounted to $13.5 million. Now turning to our outlook. Assuming no circumstances occur beyond our control, we provide the following framework for Q1 and fiscal 2024. For Q1 2024, we expect our worldwide revenues to be in the range of $960 million to $980 million, up slightly from Q4 of 2023. We expect Clear Aligner volume and ASPs to be up slightly sequentially. We expect Systems and Services revenue to be down slightly sequentially, although less than the historical seasonal decline, given the launch of the iTero Lumina for ortho workflows in Q1 2024.', 'We expect our Q1 2024 GAAP operating margin and non-GAAP operating margin to be slightly above Q1 2023 GAAP operating margin and non-GAAP operating margin, respectively. For full year, we expect fiscal 2024 total revenues to be up mid-single digits over 2023. We expect fiscal 2024 Clear Aligner and Systems and Services revenues to grow year-over-year in the same approximate range as our 2024 total revenues. We expect fiscal 2024 Clear Aligner ASPs to be up slightly year-over-year primarily due to price increases and favorable foreign exchange, partially offset by a higher mix of noncomprehensive products, which have lower ASPs. We expect fiscal 2024 GAAP operating margin and non-GAAP operating margin to be slightly above the 2023 GAAP operating margin and non-GAAP operating margin, respectively.', 'We expect our investments in capital expenditures for the fiscal 2024 to be approximately $100 million. Capital expenditures are expected to primarily relate to building construction and improvements as well as manufacturing capacity in support of our continued expansion. In summary, I am pleased with our fourth quarter and fiscal 2023 results, and I am especially proud of our continued focused execution of our product road map and innovation pipeline. We are committed to delivering on our strategic growth drivers of international expansion, patient demand, orthodontist utilization and GP dentist treatment to extend our leadership in digital orthodontics and dentistry. I believe that the next wave of innovation that we are introducing into the market will further differentiate Align and allow us to continue to increase our share of the large untapped market opportunity of 22 million annual orthodontic case starts as well as an additional 600 million consumers who could benefit from a healthy, beautiful smile using Invisalign Clear Aligners.', ""With that, I'll turn it back to Joe for final comments. Joe?"", ""Joseph Hogan: Thanks, John. In closing, while I'm pleased with our better-than-expected fourth quarter results and start to the year, I'm even more excited about Align innovation in 2024 and our next wave of growth drivers. When I spoke to you about a year ago, I discussed the innovations that we are planning to bring to market that we continue to revolutionize the orthodontic and dental industry and scanning software and direct 3D printing. We are delivering on that promise. With the introduction of iTero Lumina powered by Multi-Direct Capture technology, we are pushing the boundaries of what inter-oral scanners can do. iTero Lumina is a combination of years of research and development to offer visualization capabilities that support doctors, clinical decisions while also enhancing their patients' comfort and overall treatment experiences."", 'Building on more than 20 years of expertise in revolutionizing imaging technologies, the iTero Lumina scanner elevates the standard in digital scanning to achieve exceptional clinical outcomes and increased practice efficiency. The iTero scanner is at the forefront of digital dentistry. With the closing of our acquisition of Cubicure, a pioneer of direct 3D printing solutions for polymer additive manufacturing, we will enable the next generation of 3D printed products, helping to create more unique configurations for aligners that are more sustainable and also efficient solutions. We also expect it to extend and scale our printing materials and manufacturing capabilities for our 3D printed product portfolio, which now includes the Invisalign Palate Expander System.', 'And with the introduction of IPE, we have expanded the clinical applicability of the Invisalign system to nearly 100% of the orthodontic case starts. The ability to direct 3D print, IPE will eventually lead to other direct printed products with the goal of direct 3D printed Invisalign Clear Aligners, which we hope to achieve in the next couple of years. As a company, Align has multifaceted competitive advantage, technology innovation, where we invest up to $300 million in R&D per year to bring in some of the most disruptive products in digital dentistry and orthodontics to the market in a highly regulated industry. A direct sales force that consists of 5,000 highly trained specialists, a doctor-centered model because we understand the importance of doctor-directed care, a $1 billion brand trusted by over 17 million patients worldwide and global scale and manufacturing to deliver millions of customized Clear Aligner parts every day.', ""We are extremely pleased with our latest innovations and commercialization of products to better serve our doctors, customers and their patients. Our belief in the future business overall is unwavering. Before we turn the call over to the operator, I want to address an important matter regarding DTC or direct to consumer Clear Aligners in our industry. Align has always believed that a doctor-centered model for orthodontic treatment is the safest for patients, and we're always looking for new and better ways to support doctors as they work to create better smiles for their patients. Recent news regarding the bankruptcy of a DTC clear aligner company has led many consumers to reach out to Invisalign providers to address their unmet needs, including helping those DTC patients with incomplete treatments."", ""To support these former DTC patients who are seeking help from Invisalign providers and practices, in Q4 we introduced a program in the U.S. and select other markets, offering up to a 50% off Invisalign case submission in Vivera Retention to help offset any additional cost to finish their treatment. We want to help everyone achieve a healthy beautiful smile and strongly recommend that individuals who are impacted by this matter seek the advice of a licensed orthodontist or dentist. Our concierge team is always available to answer questions and help connect consumers with Invisalign practices. With that, I'll thank you for your time today. We look forward to updating you on our next earnings call. Now I'll turn the call over to the operator for questions."", 'Operator?', 'See also Jim Cramer is Bullish on These 10 Stocks and 15 Cheapest Countries to Get Second Citizenship.', 'To continue reading the Q&A session, please click here.']"

It invested $10 billion in ChatGPT developer OpenAI last year, and it has integrated the start-up's technology into its entire product portfolio. In fact, Microsoft is one of very few companies successfully monetizing AI software at scale right now."", ""The company's results for the fiscal 2024 second quarter (ended Dec. 31) are now in the books, and growth in its AI-related segments is skyrocketing. When investors look back on this moment five years from now, they might wish they'd bought Microsoft stock. Here's why."", ""For the past year, most investors have focused on Microsoft's business-to-business cloud computing platform Azure, where the company is deploying AI-as-a-service to tens of thousands of customers. That segment is still critical, and I'll discuss it in more detail shortly, but first, let's explore Copilot because it gained a heap of momentum in Q2."", ""Microsoft Copilot is a virtual assistant powered by large language models (LLM) and generative AI, which is capable of creating text, images, videos, and even computer code. It was developed independently of ChatGPT, but Copilot does borrow some of OpenAI's technology. It's embedded for free in the Windows operating system, Edge internet browser, and Bing internet search engine."", ""Copilot is also available in Office 365 applications like Word, PowerPoint, and Excel. Businesses can access it for $30 per user, per month, and Microsoft's research found it accelerated tasks like writing, searching, and summarizing by 29%. Microsoft has more than 400 million paid 365 seats (users), and all of them are candidates for the Copilot upgrade, so this is a substantial financial opportunity."", 'Then there is Copilot for the Microsoft Power Platform, which allows businesses to build everything from websites to software applications without writing code. No-code technology can effectively turn any employee into a developer, and in Q2, over 230,000 businesses were using Power, which was a whopping 80% increase from just three months prior.', ""But it gets better. The new Copilot Studio platform allows businesses to customize Copilot for their own needs. It means they don't have to use the out-of-the-box version of Copilot for 365, for example, which empowers them to unlock an even greater productivity boost. Over 10,000 organizations are using Copilot Studio in Q2, with prices starting at $200 per month. As Copilot becomes more widely adopted, the Studio platform will eventually be an essential tool for every organization."", 'Microsoft generated a record-high $62 billion in revenue during Q2, which was an 18% increase year over year. The company breaks its results into three core segments, but Intelligent Cloud led the way (as is normally the case), with revenue growing by 20.3% to $25.8 billion.', ""But the real story within Intelligent Cloud was Azure. Its revenue grew by an impressive 30%, with 6 percentage points of that growth coming specifically from AI. That's double the contribution AI made in the prior quarter just three months earlier."", ""Microsoft delivers OpenAI's latest industry-leading GPT-4 models to its business customers through Azure, which they can use to develop their own AI applications. The company said it had over 53,000 Azure AI customers in Q2, and one-third of them weren't Azure users at all 12 months ago. In other words, AI specifically has attracted around 17,700 new business customers to Azure in the past year."", 'Microsoft also said more than half of the Fortune 500 companies are now Azure AI customers, including beverage giant Cola-Cola, which has deployed generative AI in a few different ways of late.', 'Azure deal sizes are also growing, with an increase in billion-dollar contracts in Q2. Microsoft says telecommunications provider Vodafone will invest $1.5 billion in cloud and AI services over the next 10 years. Microsoft told investors that generative AI is driving a 70% increase in productivity for some work tasks, and if that trend continues, there could be thousands of businesses like Vodafone around the world that deploy billions of dollars into the technology.', ""Microsoft delivered $2.93 in earnings per share (profit) during Q2. Not only was that a 33% increase year over year, but it was also comfortably above Wall Street's expectations of $2.78. The company has now generated $11.06 in trailing-12-month earnings, which places its stock at a price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 36.8."", ""That is expensive relative to the rest of the market. The Nasdaq-100 technology index, for example, trades at a P/E ratio of 31.4. But here's why Microsoft has earned that premium."", ""First, Azure is the world's second-largest cloud platform behind Amazon Web Services (AWS). However, AWS only grew its revenue by 12% in its last quarter, whereas Azure grew by 29% during the equivalent period -- and now 30% in the more recent Q2. In other words, it's rapidly taking market share, and much of that is due to AI."", ""Beyond Azure, Microsoft likely has more scale with which to monetize AI software than any other company. Given the substantial installed base of Office 365 applications, the transition to AI-enabled versions will be extremely simple. Microsoft doesn't even have to acquire new customers to generate significant financial growth; it simply has to upsell its existing users."", ""Even if Microsoft grows its earnings per share by a relatively modest compound annual rate of 10% for the next five years -- and assuming its P/E ratio remains constant -- that could translate into 61% upside in its stock price. But considering Microsoft's earnings soared by 30% in the first six months of fiscal 2024, that 10% growth rate might prove to be a very conservative baseline."", 'Where to invest $1,000 right now', 'When our analyst team has a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

While we are already seeing traction, there was an impact in the quarter, and it will take some time to normalize. Let me walk you through the details. Our performance in the quarter was fundamentally strong. Our Q1 total company revenue was a record $9.4 billion, up 8% year-over-year. Our global comparable store sales grew 5% year-over-year, supported by a 5% comp growth in North America, driven by 4% ticket growth, and 10% comp growth in China. Our global operating margins expanded by 130 basis points to 15.8% and our overall earnings per share grew 20% to $0.90. This speaks to the continued successful execution of our reinvention plan and the durable business we are building.', 'We are fortunate to have built one of the strongest brands in the world and we continue to benefit from customer loyalty. Throughout the quarter, we saw our most loyal customers around the world coming into our stores more often. Specifically in the US, we set new records with our 90-day active reward members growing 13% year-over-year to a record 34.3 million, with tender reaching an all-time high of 59%, demonstrating increased engagement. Importantly, the frequency of our most loyal customers increased sequentially and spend per member reached a record in Q1, fueled by our holiday promotion which significantly exceeded our expectations. Our cold and gingerbread platforms drove a record high ticket in the US in the quarter. We also had the highest sales of Starbucks gift cards in our history, making us number two in gift cards sold.', 'In total, we have an incredible $3.6 billion preloaded onto our cards in the US in the quarter. In short, our growing Starbucks Rewards members are visiting our stores more frequently and increasing their spend each time that they come. We also saw great momentum in China. We aim to be the best in the premium market in China. Our brand equity across Starbucks and Starbucks Reserve is second to none. Based on our latest brand tracker, Starbucks continues to be the first choice in away from home coffee, including among the Gen Z consumers. We continue to lead in brand affinity and have the highest awareness, brand familiarity, and purchase-intent scores. We have the most outstanding partners in our stores, with very strong customer connection, and the highest retention rates in our industry.', ""We offer distinctive global and locally relevant product innovation anchored on superior coffee with food attachments and a morning daypart that now has surpassed pre-COVID levels. Our loyal customers, a major part of tender, are coming more often, and our loyalty program is growing. We're doing all of this while offering premium physical and digital experiences delivered across our distinctive store portfolio, across other physical channels and through our digital connection and doing so at a commensurate value. This ambition being best in premium in China is in line with our long-term growth ambitions for China. Let me now talk about the headwinds and our response. We entered the first quarter very strong globally, we had great momentum in August and September and that continued into October, which exceeded our expectations across every measure."", 'Beginning in mid-November, while our business continued to grow, the growth rate was impacted by three unexpected factors. First, we saw a negative impact to our business in the Middle East. Second, events in the Middle East also had an impact in the US, driven by misperceptions about our position. Our most loyal customers remained loyal and in fact increased their frequency and spend in the quarter. But we did see a softening of US traffic. Specifically, our occasional US customers who tend to visit in the afternoon came in less frequently. I will speak in a moment as to how we quickly responded with an effective action plan. Finally, we experienced a slower than expected recovery in China, driven by a more cautious consumer. While we had a relatively very strong 11/11 holiday, the overall market weakness led to significantly increased pricing competition.', ""We responded quickly to these headwinds. In the US, we implemented targeted offers aimed at bringing our occasional customers into our loyalty program. As we've seen over time, Starbucks Rewards members develop a routinized long-term relationship with our brand that increases both ticket and transactions. Additionally, we activated new capabilities within our proprietary deep Deep Brew data analytics and AI tool to identify and incentivize specific Rewards members cohorts. Finally, we are leaning further into our brand marketing and factual narrative and social media to engage these audiences where they are. We've already seen the positive impact of these new initiatives with our more occasional customers beginning to rebound in December. However, we continue to see further opportunity to welcome back our very occasional customers."", ""We feel good about the trajectory over the course of the quarter, but it will take time for our plans to be fully realized. In China, we remain very confident in the long term. The market is going through a transition as we see an increase in mass market competitors, which we believe will shake out over time, and the market will emerge looking fundamentally different than what we see today. We expect a much larger and tiered market as per capita consumption continues to increase and the market matures. There are three key elements in our China strategy. First, we are offering more coffee forward, locally relevant product innovations and we're increasing engagement in social media channels through influences and partnerships, which are highly effective in China."", ""These actions are increasing awareness and have led to greater customer frequency. Second, we have made significant investments in technology, increasing our omni-channel capability, allowing us to serve more customers through new occasions. These investments have also led to a more digitized store environment, increasing efficiency of our supply chain and stores, while enhancing the partner experience and strengthening our unit economics in both existing and new stores. Finally, we're increasing the percentage of new stores opening in lower tier markets and new county cities, where we see meaningfully stronger new store economics. As you can see, we moved quickly to respond and implement a plan to address these unexpected headwinds. It will take time for these action plans to be fully realized."", ""That said, we remain confident in our Triple Shot strategy and our long-term growth. So let me share some of the progress in the quarter. Our first Triple Shot Reinvention priority is to elevate our brand by operating great stores and driving product innovation. The best lever for elevating our brand is our store experience. We continue to raise the bar on running great stores with a focus on enhancing both our partner and customer experience. One example is the continued rollout of our Siren System cold and food stations. We remain on track to have approximately 10% of our stores equipped with a Siren System by the end of this year. We are a coffee company, and we will continue to lead with coffee innovation. We're continuing the installation of our Clover Vertica in nearly 10% of our US company-operated stores in the quarter."", 'We are on track to have on-demand single-cup brewers installed in nearly 60% of our US company-operated stores in fiscal year 2024. This will continue to elevate our coffee offering while also making partners more productive by reducing waste and creating efficiencies in store, allowing them to spend more time doing what they do best, connecting with our customers. Just imagine, a perfectly brewed on-demand cup of coffee at any time throughout the day, even decaf. This quality and the offering are like no other in the industry. We also continue to offer coffee blends which are distinctive and remind people of the romance of coffee. Our Verona blend is anchored in the essence of Verona, Italy. It was our tribute to the city of romance in Italy.', ""In celebration of our five years in Italy, we will introduce a new coffee, Starbucks Milano Roast, inspired by the art and culture of Milan. Milan's miart, an international modern and contemporary art fair, is the perfect backdrop to a launch in our Milan Roastery that will then scale globally. The moment will capture our love of coffee, the passion of our partners, and the dynamism of Milano. Today, we're excited to launch the Oleato platform with Oleato customizations across the US. In the coming weeks, we will also launch Chocolate Covered Strawberry Creme Frappuccino and a Chocolate Hazelnut Cookie Cold Brew in time for Valentine's Day. Starting this week and continuing over the next few months, we will be introducing three new beverage platforms, each of which is squarely aimed at our Gen Z and millennial customers across a range of coffee and cold beverages and compelling for the afternoon."", ""These product innovations are examples of how we continuously elevate the brand and welcome customers back with a unique Starbucks experience. We're also offering new and exciting options beyond coffee, including food that appeals to different dayparts, especially the afternoon. In January, we added new menu items, including the Potato, Cheddar & Chive Bakes and the Chicken, Maple Butter & Egg Sandwich. These are products that tide our customers over between lunch and dinner. Importantly, our digital experience makes attaching food to afternoon drink orders easy and convenient. We've seen a very positive customer response to these new items and we are expanding inventory to meet the strong demand. We're also pleased with the pace of our new store openings and strong unit economics."", 'Our most recent age class of company operated new stores in the US is averaging unit volumes of approximately $2 million with ROIs of approximately 50%. And as we continue to open more stores, growing by approximately 4% this year in the US on a base of over 16,000, including licensed stores, we will further invest in purpose-built stores to meet our customers where they need and want us to be. This includes drive-throughs which have grown by over 500 stores since Q1 of last year. Even in the US, we see abundant greenfield opportunity ahead. Our second strategic priority is further strengthening and differentiating our leadership position in digital. We saw our mobile order and pay surpass a record high 30% of all transactions in the quarter.', ""And we reduced downtime of mobile order and pay by half, as we continued to find ways to deliver a better customer experience. We'll continue to make the Starbucks app even better, including adding the ability to use a personal cup in ordering through the app, and the rollout of more accurate order wait times. We're also laser focused on ensuring our customers can personalize their orders in whatever way they want. One example is helping customers find products based on dietary needs. We saw record results in our US delivery business with growth of nearly 80% year-over-year, aided by our expanded partnership with DoorDash. We see significant growth for continued incremental growth as delivery represents only 2% of our transactions. Our purpose-built stores optimized for delivery and fulfillment help seize this opportunity."", ""Additionally, we are conducting a pilot with Gopuff, targeting a fully incremental opportunity for overnight orders between 5:00 PM and 5:00 AM. In this pilot, Starbucks trained baristas prepare handcrafted Starbucks drinks and food inside Gopuff micro-fulfillment centers, delivering to the customer's door in about 30 minutes. To further expand the reach and impact of mobile ordering and rewards, we now offer Starbucks Connect in over 40% of our more than 6,700 US licensed stores with further expansion planned for this year. We're also pleased to share that Bank of America will be our next Starbucks Rewards partner, delivering even more value to our most loyal customers. This opportunity builds with the great success of our partnership at Delta Airlines that is deep in connection and engagement with our members, and is one of two new Starbucks Rewards partnerships we told you we would roll out this year."", 'Our third strategic priority is becoming truly global. Our international business represents an important growth opportunity for us over the long term. If you look at our business excluding the headwinds, we had a strong quarter, demonstrating the momentum and resiliency across the portfolio. We opened over 420 net new stores in the quarter, a growth of 10% year-over-year, bringing total store count to over 20,600 stores with nearly 14,000 of those stores outside of China and the US. In Japan, we reached a milestone of 1,900 stores across the market with much opportunity ahead. Let me address our business in the Middle East. I am deeply distressed by the violence shaking the region. As I have shared, Starbucks condemns violence against the innocent, hate and weaponized speech.', 'We are intensely focused on supporting our partners and the many other stakeholders affected by what is taking place. We have seen a significant impact on traffic and sales in the region, and we are working with our licensees during this time to ensure the safety and well-being of our partners and our customers. I shared earlier in my remarks how we are addressing the near-term situation in China. Overall, our business and brand in China remain strong. Our revenue in the quarter grew 20% in constant currency, underpinned by a 10% increase in comparable store sales growth as the market lapped prior year mobility restrictions. As we strengthen our position in the premium market in China, let me point to a few accomplishments of the quarter. We launched 12 new coffee forward beverages in the quarter, including Intenso, which was incredibly popular with our customers, including Gen Z, fueling the morning daypart, which is now larger than pre-COVID levels.', 'Our digital channels accounted for a record 52% of sales, up 4 percentage points quarter-over-quarter. Our Starbucks Rewards Gold member frequency increased by nearly 10% over the prior quarter with total member engagement setting a record 73% of tender, demonstrating the stability of our most loyal customers. Our new stores continue to deliver attractive returns on both the top line and profitability, with further strength in unit economics in stores opened in new county cities. And our turnover amongst full-time store partners reached a record low in the quarter, coupled with an all-time high partner satisfaction score. Early this month we celebrated our 25th anniversary in China. With nearly 7,000 stores, we have built a durable business.', ""We have built a terrific brand, and we are well on track to hit our 9,000 store target by 2025 and continue to have full confidence in the market opportunity. We continue to see enormous potential in China's premium market, and no one is better positioned to lead in this space. Even as we navigate a dynamic environment, we remain confident in our long-term growth in our international segment. As part of elevating our brand across the international segment, along with a second reserve store in India, we will open two additional Starbucks roasteries that celebrate coffee, art and design in markets outside the US and China. We will announce these locations and opening timings in due course. Turning to our fourth priority, we've focused on unlocking $3 billion in efficiencies, and I'm pleased to say that we're making steady progress."", ""Our Triple Shot Reinvention efforts delivered 130 basis points of margin expansion in the first quarter of the fiscal year. As you've heard me say often, the key to our success is the experience that our partners create for our customers. We're investing in a better experience for our partners to advance our business through a more balanced growth model as we unlock efficiency. In the quarter, we have seen the effectiveness of the reinvention-driven investments we have made in in-store operational efficiencies, such as standards, equipment innovation, and scheduling improvements, leading to a more stable environment for our partners. Turnover has decreased by 5% year-over-year and is now well below pre-COVID levels. Average partner hours increased 10%, leading to a 14 percentage point increase in partner sentiment related to scheduling, specifically preferred hours, which we know is important to partners."", ""We are listening to our partners and investing to make their experience better. Of course, we have more work to do, but we are proud of the progress we have made to date. Outside of our stores, we're working to drive efficiencies across our supply chain and expenses. I am pleased with the progress and we remain on track to unlock [few billion] (ph) dollars in efficiencies over the next three years. Our final priority is reinvigorating our partner culture. In addition to the investments in partner experience, we're focused on partner culture. Our leadership team and Board of Directors have been deeply engaged in putting the partner experience at the heart of the business. An independent assessment found that our strategic investments, greater on the ground support, a dedicated labor relations team, and more bespoke management trading are having a tangible impact on the commitments we've made to our partners."", ""The assessment was also clear that there has been no union busting playbook at Starbucks. I want to be clear in my view on the matter of unionization at Starbucks. We believe in a direct relationship with our partners, and in the 4% of our stores in the US where our partners have chosen to be represented by a union, we are committed to finding a constructive path forward with those unions. I care deeply about our partners, their experiences and safety at Starbucks and their futures. Our partners remain core to the success of our business. And I am proud to be restitching the fabric of the green apron for all partners. Going forward, we plan to continue to focus deeply on reinvigorating our partner culture. It's a priority for me and I'll continue spending time each month working up close, shoulder to shoulder with partners in stores."", ""I did this during my visit to India earlier this month and I will continue doing it to stay grounded in the realities of the business. Good and not so good. I'm also proud to have earned my Coffee Master black apron along with my executive leadership team. A deep connection to partners and to coffee is a top priority for me and for every leader at Starbucks. As you look ahead to what is brewing for Starbucks in 2024, I have great optimism. We have a strong strategy. Our refreshed mission, values and promises are underpinning everything we do. We have many strengths to build on and a clear plan to navigate this dynamic environment. While it will take time, we are confident we have significant headroom to further grow top line and bottom line in the long term and invest in our partners and the business while delivering strong shareholder returns."", 'Finally, before I turn this over to Rachel, I want to remind everyone that Starbucks is focused on human connection. We stand for belonging. We stand for joy. We stand for humanity. That is what differentiates our brand and our business and has for the last 52 years. We believe this has never been more important in the world. And with that, Rachel.', 'Rachel Ruggeri: Thank you, Laxman, and good afternoon, everyone. Let me start by saying that I am so proud of the significant margin expansion and double-digit earnings growth we delivered in our first quarter despite the top line headwinds we experienced. Our strong focus on reinvention continued to unlock efficiencies, driving a balanced outcome where both revenue growth and margin expansion drove our earnings growth. As we have shared, we are unlocking multiple paths to support our earnings growth over the long term, creating a more durable business and this quarter proved testament to that durability. Our Q1 consolidated revenue reached a record $9.4 billion, up over 8% from the prior year, even with the confluence of factors adversely impacting our business, as Laxman discussed in detail at the top of our call.', 'The revenue increase was driven by 5% comparable store sales growth, 8% net new company operated store growth, as well as a 6% increase in our global licensed store revenue over the prior year, underscoring the strength of our broader portfolio and our execution. Q1 consolidated operating margin expanded 130 basis points from the prior year to 15.8%, primarily driven by sales leverage and reinvention-related in-store operational efficiencies, partially offset by our continued investments in our partners. Our reinvention has successfully driven resiliency in our business, with our North America margin expanding a notable 280 basis points in the quarter, which I will discuss in further detail in a moment. Q1 EPS was $0.90, up 20% from the prior year.', ""Our strong double-digit EPS growth in the quarter demonstrates multiple paths to drive growth and profitability. I'll now provide segment highlights for Q1. North America delivered another quarter of record revenue in Q1 with $7.1 billion, up 9% from the prior year, driven by a combination of a 5% increase in comparable store sales, inclusive of a 4% and 1% increase in average ticket and transactions respectively, as well as net new company operated growth of 4% over the prior year. Our US licensed store business also contributed to the segment's growth from increased travel and further rollout of our Starbucks Connect program. Our US company operated business delivered 5% comparable store sales growth in Q1, driven by 4% ticket growing from pricing, mix, and customization."", ""This led us to having our highest average ticket in our 50-plus year history, as our successful holiday innovation and complementary product offerings, including our new Chai Tea Latte and Sugar Plum Cheese Danish, resonated with customers. Comparable transactions for the quarter increased 1% as traffic was pressured to negative single digits in November before it started to rebound in December. In light of the pressure traffic, and as Laxman mentioned earlier, customers showed strong loyalty through our Starbucks Rewards program with record engagement and the highest ever spend per member. North America's operating margin was 21.4% in Q1, expanding 280 basis points from the prior year, driven by 240 basis points from reinvention-related in-store operational efficiencies, as well as sales leverage and pricing, partially offset by continued investment in our partners."", ""This substantial margin expansion in the quarter reflected the meaningful labor staffing and scheduling improvements we made as part of our reinvention. We unlocked significant stability by focusing on staffing and scheduling hours based on partners preferred shifts, which enhanced both our partners experience and subsequent store performance. We saw a store efficiency increase as items per labor hour reached its highest levels in the quarter. Outside of stores, we reaped the benefits of enhanced sourcing and waste reductions in the first quarter, as seen by improvement in the segment's product and distribution costs. When you think about the operational efficiencies that continue to manifest both in and out of stores, we expect to continue delivering progressive margin expansion."", ""Moving to international. The segment delivered $1.8 billion in revenue in the quarter, up 12% from the prior year. The revenue growth was driven by a 12% increase in net new company-operated stores year-over-year, as well as a 7% increase in comparable store sales, driven by 11% transaction growth, partially offset by a 3% decline in average ticket. As Laxman mentioned, the pace of recovery in China was slower than expected. That, coupled with a negative impact to our business in the Middle East, pressured our international segment as a whole. However, we continue to see these headwinds as transitory and remain committed to our long-term growth ambitions in the segment. In Q1, China's revenue grew 20%, driven by 15% new store growth, as well as a 10% increase in comparable store sales growth, including 21% transaction growth, largely related to the market lapping prior year COVID impact."", ""Comparable ticket, however, declined 9% due to mix shift, including lower sales of merchandise and increased promotional environment. The market opened 169 net new stores and entered 28 new county cities in the quarter, serving as a proof point that our commitment to expanding our premium position in the market has not wavered. Total international segment operating margin was 13.1% in Q1, contracting 110 basis points from the prior year. The contraction was primarily driven by investments in partner wages and benefits, business mix shift as a greater portion of the segment's revenue was generated in our company-operated markets versus the prior year and strategic investments, partially offset by sales leverage. Shifting to channel development."", ""The segment's revenue of $448 million in Q1 declined 7% from the prior year, largely in line with our expectations given the sale of Seattle's Best Coffee. Our business continues to resonate with customers as Starbucks maintained the number one share position in both US At Home coffee and US Ready to Drink in the first quarter as our holiday offerings such as Peppermint Mocha and Gingerbread were among customer favorites. The segment's operating margin was 46.8% in Q1, down 60 basis points from prior year, driven by product costs in Global Coffee Alliance, partially offset by business makeshift. Although there was contraction in the first quarter, we continue to expect the segment's full-year operating margin to expand to the high 40% to low 50% range and be accretive to our total company margin."", 'Now, moving on to our guidance for fiscal year 2024. We are confident that the business pressures we experienced in the first quarter are transitory. With that, our guidance shared at our reinvention update in November remains unchanged related to our global store growth, operating margin, and EPS. However, given the collective magnitude of headwinds on our first quarter revenue and the time it will take for our action plans to be realized, we are revising our full year outlook for revenue and comp to reflect our Q1 results, as well as account for recent trends, including a softer than planned January, which we expect will impact our Q2 performance. With that, we now expect our full year global revenue growth in the range of 7% to 10%, revised from our previous range of the low end of 10% to 12%.', 'Full year global and US comp growth in the range of 4% to 6%, both revised from the previous range of 5% to 7%. China comp growth of low single digits for the balance of the year, revised from the previous range of 4% to 6% in Q2 through Q4 with higher comp in Q1. Just to be clear, we continue to expect to deliver full year global store growth at approximately 7%, progressive operating margin expansion on a full-year basis, full-year EPS and non-GAP EPS growth in the range of 15% to 20% as we have multiple paths to such earnings growth as we demonstrated in the first quarter. As an additional insight, here are a few clarification items related to guidance. As a reminder, our guidance does not include any impact from foreign currency translation and assumes constant currency.', ""In terms of quarterly shape, we expect growth rates for our global revenue, comp, operating margin, as well as GAAP and non-GAAP EPS to be the lowest in Q2 and meaningfully below our full fiscal year guidance ranges due to the pressures we discussed in today's call. These metrics are then expected to rebound and stabilize in the second half of our fiscal year. While we continue to expect our effective GAAP and non-GAAP tax rates in the mid-20% range, they are expected to be meaningfully higher than our fiscal year 2023 tax rate of 23.6%, which benefited from certain discrete non-recurring tax items. Finally, our disciplined capital allocation approach continues to deliver significant results. The combination of revenue growth, margin expansion, and improved working capital underpinned by the disciplined capital allocation increased our Q1 cash from operations to a record $2.4 billion."", 'Our strong cash generation, together with our leverage and investment grade rating, creates exceptional shareholder returns while maintaining balance sheet flexibility to fund our critical investments, creating a competitive advantage. In summary, here are key takeaways from my discussion today. First, our Triple Shot Reinvention is continuing to unlock our greatest potential, evidenced by the strong operating margin performance and balanced earnings growth in the first quarter in spite of the pressured environment. Next, our revenue and comp guidance has been revised to reflect our Q1 results and expected near-term and transitory headwinds. But importantly, despite these headwinds, we remain committed to our full-year fiscal 2024 EPS growth in the range of 15% to 20%.', ""Further, we have robust plans to navigate through the complex and dynamic environment and recognize our plans will take time to materialize, but remain confident in our long-term growth. And finally, our focused and disciplined approach to capital allocation drives our financial fortitude and balance sheet optionality, keeping us in a position of strength. Before I close, I want to thank all the partners across the globe who consistently find ways to create joy and foster connection to and with our customers. You give me the confidence that our best days are yet to come. So, thank you, partners. With that, I'll turn it back to Tiffany."", ""Tiffany Willis: Thank you, Rachel. Before we open the call to Q&A, we request that your questions today be focused on the quarterly performance that we just discussed, as this call is not to address questions related to recent proxy filing. With that, Diego, let's take the first question."", 'See also 15 Best Low Cost Stocks To Buy Under $75 and 11 Highest Quality Caviars in the World.', 'To continue reading the Q&A session, please click here.']"

(Operator Instructions) As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Todd Leombruno, Chief Financial Officer. Thank you. You may begin.', 'Todd M. Leombruno', ""Well, thank you, Diego, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to Parker-Hannifin's fiscal year 2024 second quarter earnings release webcast. As Diego said, this is Todd Leombruno, Chief Financial Officer speaking. And I'm here today with our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Jenny Parmentier. We know that this is an extremely busy day for everyone, and we appreciate you joining us, and we appreciate your interest in Parker. On Slide 2, you'll see our disclosures addressing forward-looking projections and non-GAAP financial measures. Actual results could vary from our forecast based on the items listed here. Our press release, this presentation and reconciliations for all non-GAAP financial measures were released this morning and are available under the Investors section at parker.com. The agenda for today is Jenny starting with the highlights of our record second quarter. She's also going to reinforce how our portfolio, our team members and the Win Strategy, our business system, are driving margin expansion and position Parker for a very bright future. I'm going to add some color on the financial results and a few details on the increase to our guidance that we released this morning. And after that, we're going to open up the lines, and Jenny and I will take any questions from those in the queue. I now ask you to move to Slide 3. And Jenny, I'll turn it over to you."", 'Jennifer A. Parmentier', ""Thank you, Todd. Good morning to everyone, and thank you for joining our call today. Q2 was a quarter of exceptional results, excellent operating performance driven by all of our team members executing the Win Strategy. Starting with safety. A 16% reduction in recordable incidents over prior Q2. Safety has been and will remain our top priority. Record sales of $4.8 billion in the quarter, a 3% increase over prior year, with organic growth of 3%. Record adjusted segment operating margin of 24.5%, a 300 basis point increase over prior year, with all segments expanding margins. And adjusted EPS growth of 29%, along with 11.9% year-to-date free cash flow margin. Aerospace strength was a significant driver of our performance in the quarter. We now expect to achieve $200 million in cumulative synergies in fiscal year '24, a $50 million increase to our original guide for this fiscal year. We remain committed to achieving $300 million in synergies by fiscal year '26. And our backlog remains resilient at $10.8 billion. We had a strong finish to the first half and, as a result, are increasing fiscal year '24 guidance, Todd will go over this later in the slide deck. Next slide, please. I'd like to spend a few minutes highlighting the power of the entire Parker portfolio. We have a technology powerhouse of interconnected solutions that delivers value for customers in both Aerospace and Industrial markets. Today, 2/3 of our revenue comes from customers who buy 4 or more of the technologies you see across the top of this page. And 2/3 of our portfolio product solutions that we have today enables clean technologies. Next slide, please. Parker has significant content on leading Aerospace programs. We have a comprehensive product offering with proprietary design on premier programs. On the upper left-hand side of this page is our first half sales mix by application. You see a nice balance of commercial and military, as well as business jets, regional transport and helicopters. This diverse aerospace and defense exposure allows us to have multiple products and technologies on every major aircraft program globally, many of them seen along the bottom of this page. All of this adds up to be a compelling value proposition for all of our aerospace customers. Next slide, please. And equally compelling is our global distribution network, a competitive differentiator for Parker. 50% of our diversified Industrial revenue is through distribution, a high-margin channel serving aftermarket and small- to medium-sized OEMs. Our distribution partners integrate Parker technologies that solve customer problems. They are truly an extension of Parker's sales and engineering teams. Building on the success of the North American distribution channel, we continue to drive an increasing revenue mix of 100 basis points per year in international markets. This past December, we held our North America national sales meeting for the first time since the pandemic. Nearly 100 distribution partners attended the meeting, along with Parker divisions and sales teams. It was great to have everyone together again. And despite the destocking, we've been talking about for several quarters, the overall sentiment and tone was very positive for the future. Next slide, please. We continue to be very proud of our margin expansion progress. Our people, our business system, The Win Strategy and our portfolio have truly transformed Parker's performance. The progress can be seen in every segment on this page. In addition to our core strategies on lean pricing and procurement, Win 3.0 initiatives like Simple by Design, our focus on demand forecasting, zero defects, and productivity and automation will take us to 25% adjusted operating margin and beyond. Every strategy and tool in the Win Strategy expand the margins. I'll now turn it back to Todd."", 'Todd M. Leombruno', ""Okay. Thanks, Jenny. I'm going to start on Slide 9, and I'm just going to really quickly go through the FY '24 Q2 financial summary. As Jenny mentioned, the second quarter was an extremely strong quarter for us. It was a great finish to the first half of our fiscal year. And once again, the team set an unbelievable amount of records for the quarter. If you look at this slide, every number in that gold column is a second quarter record. We set new highs for sales, segment operating margin, EBITDA margin, net income and earnings per share. Total sales growth was plus 3% in the quarter. All of that 3% was organic. And just a reminder, this is the first full quarter that we have Meggitt in both the current and prior year periods. The net impact of divestitures and currency basically offset each other. Divestitures were slightly unfavorable at 0.3%, currency was slightly favorable at 0.5%. When you look at the margins, Jenny already mentioned this, but 24.5% was an increase of 300 basis points versus prior year. And adjusted EBITDA margin reached 25.7%. That was an increase of 330 basis points versus prior year. If you take a look at net income, we did $802 million on an adjusted basis. That is a 16.6% return on sales. That was a 30% increase versus prior year. And lastly, adjusted earnings per share, a record for the quarter, $6.15. That was up 29% from prior. Just an exceptional second quarter. And again, unbelievable margin expansion. And what I really like about it, it was very consistent across all of our businesses, as Jenny just shared on that last slide. If you go to Slide 10, this is the earnings per share bridge. And this chart really shows what a high-quality quarter it was for the company. The 29% in adjusted earnings per share, that amounted to an additional $1.39 of earnings per share in the quarter. The main driver of this continues to be excellent operating performance. If you look at segment operating income dollars, that increased by $173 million in the quarter. That accounted for just a little over $1 of that EPS growth. And that equated to 74% of the increased earnings per share in the quarter. Clearly, Aerospace Systems was a major driver of improvement. But what is really impressive is both Industrial businesses also contributed to the increase in segment operating income dollars. If you look at tax, that was $0.18 favorable versus prior year, again, just driven by some discrete items. Other expense was favorable $0.12 versus prior year. That was mainly the result of currency changes and some favorable pension expense. Interest expense was $0.10 favorable versus prior. That really is a result of our successful efforts to reduce outstanding debt over the last 12 months. I'll talk about that in a little bit later in the deck. Corporate G&A and share count were just both slightly higher than prior year, just a net $0.03. And those are the components of the increase in adjusted earnings per share. Really, it's just strong margin performance across the company, continue with some great outstanding performance from the Meggitt business. If you go to the next slide -- oh, excuse me, if you go to Slide 11, we'll talk about the segment performance. That's detailed on Slide 11. I couldn't be prouder of the broad-based margin expansion really driven by the Win Strategy. Jenny mentioned this, but our synergies are ahead of schedule. We did increase that synergy number. Aerospace demand really remains very, very high. So just a nice consistent execution across our businesses, across all of our global team members. You can see that segment operating margin, 24.5%, at the bottom of the page, up 300 basis points. Incrementals were stellar at over 100%. And orders remain positive at plus 2% versus prior year, and backlog really remains resilient. Total backlog dollars did increase slightly sequentially as well. And Jenny mentioned this, but total backlog remains at near record levels. And aerospace activity remains especially robust. If you look at the North American businesses, sales volume reached $2.1 billion in the quarter. Organic growth was down 1.5% versus prior year. That was driven by continued destocking, some channel rebalancing, and really some softness in off-highway markets. However, what is impressive out of the North American team is that adjusted operating margins did increase 240 basis points to a second quarter record of 24.2%. That was just really driven by excellent execution, some great efficiency improvements and really some tight cost controls. Orders in North America also remained consistent with the prior quarter. They remained at down minus 4%. If you look at the international businesses, sales were $1.4 billion, slightly positive versus prior year. Organic growth was essentially flat, which was better than we were forecasting. Organic growth in EMEA was positive at 0.7%. Latin America was positive at 9.2%. And Asia Pac did improve, it did come in at negative 2.5%, really just being pulled down by the slower-than-expected recovery in China. But also what's impressive there is adjusted operating margins did expand 110 basis points in these businesses, and also finished at a second quarter record of 23%. That international team continues to be focused on productivity improvements, expanding margins, and being very resilient across the segment even in a low growth environment. Very impressive results. Orders in the international segment did improve. If you remember, last quarter, they were minus 8%. They did improve to minus 5%. And finally, on Aerospace Systems, they delivered another standout quarter. Sales reached $1.3 billion, a 15% increase from prior year. All of that 15% is organic growth. And volume just continues to be driven by commercial aftermarket growth that was, in the quarter, up 25%. Operating margins reached a new record, increasing by 590 basis points to reach 26.5%. Really, the healthy volumes, the favorable aftermarket mix, outstanding performance from the Meggitt business really all contributed to drive these record margins. We are increasing the synergies. Jenny went over that just briefly. Cumulative synergies were increasing from $150 million to $200 million. And order rates in aerospace continue to remain plus 21%, which is very robust. On the next slide, we'll talk about cash flow. Let's take a look at what we've done there. Our year-to-date cash flow from operations is $1.4 billion. That's 14% of sales. That is an increase of 26% versus prior year. Just fantastic cash flow performance. If you look at free cash flow, that was $1.1 billion. That's up 11.9%, also increasing significantly, 29% increase from prior. Our cash flow conversion is year-to-date 86%. We really have the team remaining focused on being great generators and great deployers of cash. You've heard us say that many times. Last week, our Board approved a quarterly dividend of $1.48 per share. That is our 295th consecutive quarterly dividend. Just a nice, solid testament to our belief that we can be great generators and great deployers of cash. When you look at the full year, we are increasing our expectations for free cash flow. We've increased that range to $2.8 billion to $3.1 billion. That's moving the midpoint up $150 million to approximately $3 billion. And of course, free cash flow conversion will be over 100% for the full year. On the next slide, let's take a look at our progress on deleveraging. We did reduce debt another $400 million in the quarter. And just a reminder, since we closed Meggitt just 5 quarters ago, we have reduced debt by over $2.2 billion now and we've improved our leverage by 1.4x, both ahead -- both of those figures are ahead of what we've originally committed to. If you look at the metrics, gross debt to adjusted EBITDA is now 2.4x, net debt to adjusted EBITDA is 2.3x. And we continue to forecast just approximately $2 billion of debt pay down in the fiscal year. And now based on the performance we've got year-to-date, we expect to achieve net leverage of 2.0x by June of 2024. Just great performance across the board. Okay. On guidance, just a few details on guidance. You saw the increase to guidance. We are reaffirming our full year organic growth midpoint and increasing our margin and earnings per share expectations for the year. Our reported sales growth for the year is forecasted to be in the range of 3% to 5% or roughly 4% at the midpoint, and they are modeled 49% first half, 51% second half. In respect to organic growth, we are raising the aerospace organic growth midpoint by 200 basis points to 12% for the full year. We are also raising the international organic growth midpoint by 100 basis points to minus 2%. That's slightly better than what we gave you last quarter. Those increases are offset by a decrease in the North American organic growth midpoint by 200 basis points to minus 1.5%. Full year organic growth for the entire company remains the same as last quarter at plus 1.5%. Moving on to margins. Adjusted segment operating margin guidance is being raised to 24.3% at the midpoint. That's up 70 basis points from prior guidance. And if you look at it on a year-over-year basis, that would be 140 basis points of margin expansion versus prior year. Meggitt synergies, we've talked a lot about that, we're moving that to $200 million. Corporate G&A, interest and other are relatively unchanged from our prior guide. Tax rate is tweaked just a little bit. We expect the full year to be 22.5%. That's really based on the performance in the first half. We expect the second half to be 23.7% from a tax rate perspective. Full year as-reported earnings per share increased to $20.30 and full year adjusted earnings per share has increased to $24.20. Both of those are at the midpoint. And finally, for FY '24 Q3 adjusted earnings per share, we expect that to be $6 even at the midpoint. And as usual, we've included some more specifics in the appendix. So that's it on the increase to guide. Jenny, I will hand it back to you and ask everyone to move to Slide 15."", 'Jennifer A. Parmentier', ""Thank you, Todd. A few key messages to close this out. Q2, as we stated many times, was an exceptional quarter that closed a strong first half. We'll continue to drive positive results and accelerate our performance using the Win Strategy. Our portfolio and strengthened customer value proposition, along with growth from secular trends, will deliver organic growth of 4% to 6% over the cycle. We remain committed to our FY '27 targets of approximately $30 earnings per share and greater than $3.5 billion free cash flow. We expect another year of record performance, and we have a very promising future ahead of us. We look forward to talking to you about our promising future at our investor meeting on May 16 of this year. Back to you, Todd?"", 'Todd M. Leombruno', ""Okay. Diego, we are ready to open the lines for Q&A, and we'll take whoever is first in the queue."", 'Operator', '(Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from Joe Ritchie with Goldman Sachs.', 'Joseph Alfred Ritchie', ""Great quarter. The first place I'd like to start is just around North America. So clearly, good color, Todd, and what the guidance now implies. But it looks like your order rates are at least stabilizing there, even though you took down the growth guidance for the year. So maybe just talk a little bit about what you're seeing across those end markets and whether you're seeing any stabilization or green shoots on your North America Industrial business?"", 'Jennifer A. Parmentier', ""Sure, Joe. This is Jenny. So yes, we did see, as Todd said, a negative 1.5% of organic decline in Q2. We've had 4 consecutive quarters with negative orders now, but as Todd stated, the orders did remain the same as last quarter at minus 4%. What I would say is that destocking in the channel continued. We saw weakness in off-highway, primarily construction, in Q2, some weakness in transportation and automotive and in heavy duty. We did talk last quarter about this inventory rebalancing and destocking, not only through distribution, but also at the OEM level with customers, dealerships, dealers, and that we did anticipate this to go into calendar year '24. So I would say, overall, destocking is in line with our expectation for Q2, but North America was just a little worse. It's been a year since it started, and it's going to continue into the second half here. And that's what we have in the guide. But backlog remains strong. We had this longer horizon of backlog strength. And I would say that, as I mentioned earlier, distribution sentiment is very positive. We haven't seen any major cancellations or pushouts out there right now. So we lowered the guide, the 2.5% on this continued destocking, and the softer off-highway we think was going to continue. We see it will be construction again and ag too this quarter. But we're feeling good about this guide right now."", 'Todd M. Leombruno', ""Joe, this is Todd. I would just add. If you look at the total Industrial business, right? In total, it kind of came in exactly as we were expecting. You're exactly right, there was a little bit of a shift from North America into the international markets. But when you look at total reported sales, at least what we're guiding to, these are really very, very close to all-time highs when it comes to volumes. So we feel really good about that. We think we can continue to expand margins despite what's going on with the choppiness in the order market. So we feel really good about that."", 'Joseph Alfred Ritchie', ""Yes. That's great color from both of you. I guess my quick follow-on there is, look, the margin performance, despite the kind of weaker growth expectations in North America and really across your Industrial businesses, has been incredible. Last couple of quarters, you're above 24%. So I guess the question is like, is 24% kind of a new baseline for the Industrial businesses going forward?"", 'Todd M. Leombruno', ""Joe, it's a great question. Like I said in the comments, I couldn't be prouder of the team. We talk about this all the time, the Win Strategy. Every single item on that win strategy is a margin-enhancing set of tools. And it really is rewarding to see the team put up numbers like that. We have a target set out there. We want the company to be at 25% segment operating margin. We have not achieved that yet. We will achieve that, there is no doubt. But we're just keeping an eye on what's happening with the top line. And obviously, we're doing everything we can within the 4 walls of our facilities to make sure that we keep pushing that number higher."", 'Jennifer A. Parmentier', ""And Joe, I would just add, I mean, our culture is one of continuous improvement. And we're just -- we're never waiting for a downturn. We're using all the tools in the Win Strategy to expand margins. And again, I got to echo Todd's comments, we couldn't be prouder of the team. They're just really doing a really nice job in a slower growth environment. We expect that to continue."", 'Operator', 'Our next question comes from Julian Mitchell with Barclays.', 'Julian C.H. Mitchell', ""Maybe just wanted to understand on the international business in Industrial. Orders have been down, I think, for 5 quarters now. You slightly took up the sales guide. What's your impression of sort of where we are in that orders downturn? Maybe help us understand sort of what on the revenue side changed a little bit. And are we thinking it's sort of a very gradual, maybe we find a floor in the next couple of quarters and then a very gradual recovery thereafter across those main regions in international?"", 'Jennifer A. Parmentier', ""Thanks, Julian. This is Jenny. So listen, we've been saying it's just been choppy in international now for several quarters. But flat -- call it, flat organic growth in Q2. As Todd said, orders did improve from minus 8% in Q1 to minus 5% in Q2. Europe, EMEA, had positive organic growth of 0.7%. It was better than our forecast, as you said, really due to some resilience in our filtration business and favorable project business timing. We did see destocking continue. We see some softness in off-highway and Industrial markets. In Asia Pacific, Todd mentioned the 2.5% organic decline. China recovery is still slow. I mean, we did see some low single-digit positive growth for China in Q2, but again, it was against a much easier comp from the COVID shutdown last year. So off-highway construction remains soft in Asia Pacific, transportation, truck, I would say that India does remain a bright spot in Asia Pacific. When we look forward, that full year organic growth improved 100 basis points really due to the strength we saw in Q2, and an improvement in orders in Asia Pacific. We do expect that Europe destocking will continue and that softness that I mentioned in Q2, off-highway and Industrial markets, will continue. Again, China recovery is still slow, but the team is doing a great job controlling the cost and giving margin performance in the region. And I would say that when you look at the rest of Asia, Japan and Korea is still pretty soft in semicon. But again, Southeast Asia and India look good right now."", 'Julian C.H. Mitchell', ""That's helpful. And then just my follow-up on Aerospace Systems. Maybe help us understand sort of, is it more volume or price perhaps in commercial that drove the revenue guide uplift for aero? And on the synergies point, it came in with a much stronger margin than I think people were expecting for the second quarter, in Aerospace. Maybe help us understand kind of any bucket of those synergies that's coming in ahead of plan?"", 'Todd M. Leombruno', ""Yes, Julian, this is Todd. I'll start on the increase to the top line, obviously, you could see demand across all verticals in the Aerospace business is extremely strong. If you look at what we did in the quarter, 15% organic growth in the quarter, that gave us the confidence to raise the second half. That has been a big plus. If you look at within the business, the mix, it's 47% aftermarket. That was higher than we were forecasting. So that was a part of driving that margin expansion. And we've talked about this now for a year on Meggitt and our base Aerospace business. it really is -- the volume is certainly a help to that. But it's really the team working through the efficiency. The supply chain is still a little noisy on the aerospace side of the business, but it's really -- the team has started to perform in a normalized environment when it comes to that. So that's what gave us comfort in Aerospace."", 'Jennifer A. Parmentier', ""Yes. We've obviously, with pulling the synergies ahead, we've had some great performance by the team. We've done a really nice job delayering the organization and getting it into the Parker division structure. And now we're really starting to see the benefits of implementing the Win Strategy. So the team is really doing a nice job. And as Todd said, we expect this to continue. Volume always helps."", 'Operator', 'Our next question comes from Scott Davis with Melius Research.', 'Scott Reed Davis', ""Just kind of a nuanced question, and excuse if you think it's weird, but your gross margin is just -- has gone up a ton, right? Pre-COVID kind of 25%, today, 35-plus percent. Op margins have gone up, call it, 500 basis points or so that same time frame. But is the future margin improvement that you guys see, do you think it will come more from gross margin than kind of SG&A leverage? Or would we expect a balance there? I guess it's a nuanced question, but I'm kind of fascinated with, it feels like there could be some upside to operating margins perhaps beyond even what you've shown today."", 'Todd M. Leombruno', ""Yes, Scott, it's a great question. It's something we look at intensely across the organization. I think there's upside on both areas, to be totally honest with you. But you're right. If you look at what we've done, and it depends on if you're looking at the as-reported gross margin number, there is a lot of noise in there from the purchase accounting transactions over the last year. But this quarter was fairly clean. So I expect it to stay at the high levels it was at this quarter and obviously improve from there. We are constantly looking at SG&A and reinventing ourselves everywhere that we do business. So I really do think that there is potential in both areas."", 'Jennifer A. Parmentier', ""Yes. I'll just pile on a little bit there. The Win Strategy tools apply to the entire business, right? So I agree with Todd to be in both places. And I mentioned earlier some of the Win Strategy initiatives that came with 3.0. And you look at Simple by Design, just yielding benefits everywhere up and down. And then some of the initiatives that we have around demand forecasting, allowing us to better analyze demand, better staff our factories, really be able to serve the customer better, really reduce our overall cost of service to the customers. So that's really a plus. And then our Zero Defect initiative. A lot of activity around producing a product 100% quality the first time, and that's a lot of cost reduction there. So just a lot of tools in our toolbox to continue to expand margins. And a lot of nice work done across the board by all the teams. The high-performance team structure really lends itself to improvements throughout the whole organization. So it's not going to be in just one area, it'll be across the board."", 'Operator', 'Our next question comes from Nicole DeBlase with Deutsche Bank.', 'Nicole Sheree DeBlase', ""Just maybe starting with the cadence of EPS through the year. I think just looking back at normal seasonality, do you typically see like a step-up in the second half from either the first half or 2Q, however you want to look at it? I mean what are the key puts and takes you're embedding more of like a step down at the midpoint this year?"", 'Todd M. Leombruno', ""Nicole, that's a great question. We looked at that a lot as we put this guidance together. What I like about the guide is the EPS is evenly split now first half, second half, it's 50-50, so there's no big ramp in the second half that should be concerning. I would call out that Q1 and Q2, obviously, those were both record numbers when it comes to EPS. So I think that's a little bit of the driver there. Aerospace business remains strong. We have no concerns about that business whatsoever. But we did see some softness in the North American businesses. And obviously, international got a little bit better, but it's still a little choppiness out there. So that's really the elements that went into our guide. If you look at both of those quarters and really the second half of the year, I mean, we really are still guiding at the record levels of earnings per share."", 'Nicole Sheree DeBlase', 'Totally understood. And then just going back to some of the order trends. You guys gave really good color around the international revenues that you saw. But what actually improved sequentially in the orders going from the down 8% to the down 5% in 2Q?', 'Jennifer A. Parmentier', ""Asia Pacific orders improved in the quarter. That's (inaudible)."", 'Operator', 'Next question comes from Nathan Jones with Stifel.', 'Nathan Hardie Jones', ""I'm going to start off on capital allocation. Now that the balance sheet is in a much better order post paying down a lot of the debt of Meggitt, being back to maybe around 2x net leverage at the end of 2024, can you talk about your willingness to get back into the M&A market? We're in a bit of a different interest rate environment than we were when you bought Meggitt. You went up to a little over 3.5x of leverage to buy that. What your appetite is for potentially levering up given the different interest rate environment and priorities for debt versus M&A?"", 'Jennifer A. Parmentier', ""Thank you, Nathan. This is Jenny. Well, first of all, as we've said, debt paydown is our #1 priority. But as Todd mentioned, we are ahead of schedule for achieving around that 2.0x number by the end of this fiscal year. One thing I would say is that we never let the pipeline go dry. We're always working the pipeline. We've built a lot of relationships over the years. That's how we've wound up with these great companies in our portfolio. And we continue to do that. We have to have the right deal. It has to be the right property out there. We still want to be the consolidator of choice. We like all of our 8 technologies. We do see an opportunity to build on the entire portfolio. We want that to be driven by secular trends and longer cycle, faster-growing, more resilient businesses. And we wanted to be accretive to margins, to EPS, to cash flow. So we'll keep this pipeline going. And we'll be looking for that right deal."", 'Nathan Hardie Jones', 'I mean, would you be willing to do something like 3.5x of leverage and then delever after that, again, given the change in the interest rate environment as a lower number kind of your feeling these days given the interest rate environment?', 'Todd M. Leombruno', ""Nathan, this is Todd. I'll take a stab at that. So listen, we're not trying to do anything bigger than what we've done. Jenny said it, I think, very well, we're trying to make sure we do the right deal for the company, for the shareholders. What we have proven is we have proven that we can delever quickly. We generate cash like we've never done before. And I think what we've been is we've been created with the way we structured those deals that allows us some flexibility on that. So I don't think we would -- we wouldn't be afraid to do something like what we did before, but we don't necessarily have to do that if it doesn't present itself."", 'Operator', 'Our next question comes from Mig Dobre with Baird.', 'Mircea Dobre', ""All right. Just a follow-up on that discussion with Nathan. When you're approaching M&A at this point, first, are you sort of just looking at the 8 technologies that you currently have in your portfolio? Or are you willing to look more broadly beyond that? And also, how do you sort of think about your specific vertical or end-market exposure? You've done some sizable things obviously in Aerospace. Is that still an area that you're looking at? Or are you, frankly, willing to look to further diversify your portfolio beyond the end-markets that you currently have exposure to?"", 'Jennifer A. Parmentier', ""We like the 8 core technologies. We think that, that is where we do really well. We don't have a specific Aerospace mix number that we target. Right now, we have a nice balance between the segments. But we're going to continue to keep growing the Industrial business as well. So we're going to be looking at the markets that we know, customers that we know, and technologies that we're familiar with. So that's our current focus."", 'Todd M. Leombruno', ""And I would just add, you're right, we have expanded the Aerospace exposure pretty significantly. But those are the same technologies that we have throughout the entire company. So they just happen to be in Aerospace end-markets. The applications are part of those 8 technologies. So that's why we like those 8 technologies."", 'Mircea Dobre', ""Understood. And then I know a lot of people asked about margins, I guess I'll ask one as well. The performance in Industrial really kind of stood out to me, given everything that's going on in those end markets. And I'm sort of curious as to what are you effectively doing there? Is this margin expansion that we're seeing more of a cost mitigation and an environment in which the volumes are, frankly, not that great? Or is there something more structural in nature? If we see reacceleration, for instance, in fiscal '25, should we assume normal incremental margins at that point on this base? Or will some of these costs that you're taking out eventually come back with volume?"", 'Jennifer A. Parmentier', ""I think you can -- we can say that you would see normal incremental margins with an acceleration. It's a lot of what we've talked about this morning. The Win Strategy is very effective across all the businesses. And our teams are doing an excellent job with some of our legacy tools around lean and supply chain, as well as some of those newer initiatives that are driving cost out. And we'll continue to see that in the Industrial business. We've said a couple of times, Win Strategy 3.0 still has room in it, and we'll continue to expand margins."", 'Operator', 'Our next question comes from Andrew Obin with Bank of America. Our next question comes from Jeff Sprague with Vertical Research Partners.', 'Todd M. Leombruno', ""Yes. Diego, it's a busy day out there. I know people might be stacked up on multiple calls."", 'Operator', ""We have Joe O'Dea with Wells Fargo."", ""Joseph John O'Dea"", ""Jenny, I wanted to circle back. You talked about sort of recent meetings with distributors and a broadly sort of positive tone. Can you just expand on that a little bit in terms of how maybe that tone has changed over the last several months, what they're pointing to, trying to understand bigger picture thematic elements versus a little bit more near term kind of on the ground and what folks are talking about seeing out there?"", 'Jennifer A. Parmentier', ""I would have to tell you that, visiting distributors and talking with distributors over the last several quarters, I've never felt a negative tone. They've all felt rather positive and bullish on the future. A slowdown in orders, but never an overall concern of what was in front of us. What I would say about the meeting in December is that there was just a lot of talk about a return to acceleration. Not seeing it yet, but very positive that it would come. And commentary on it's been almost 4 quarters now, now it has been 4 quarters and we usually see that turn coming in front of us. So just a very overall positive sentiment. Some of them are participating in some of these, what we would call, mega CapEx projects. They've commented on how they're working with some local and national contractors on new plants that are being built, site prep and some of the walls going up. So some feel really positive about that. So again, really good sentiment, good tone about the future."", ""Joseph John O'Dea"", 'I appreciate the color. And then I also wanted to ask on international margins. I think you commented about ongoing progress in terms of the distribution side of the margin profile improving on the International segment. But those International margins are pretty close to North America margins, too. So just if we think specifically about the distribution side, what does the margin gap look like sort of International versus North America? How much more upside should we think about in terms of navigating higher on international distribution margins?', 'Todd M. Leombruno', ""Yes. Joe, this is Todd. We've been very public, the sales that go through the distribution network are anywhere from 10 to 15 margin points better than our direct shipments. And that's just -- it's part of the structure of the channel, sort of the value they add, Jenny had a nice slide that kind of went through why that is supportive of that margin mix. What we've been trying to do for many years now is to increase that mix in the international businesses. And that was on the slide as well. We think we're not done with that yet."", 'Jennifer A. Parmentier', ""No, we're not done."", 'Todd M. Leombruno', '(inaudible) more room to grow on that. So we feel like that still has room to grow, and that will also be a margin driver out into the future.', 'Operator', 'Our next question comes from Jeff Hammond with KeyBanc Capital Markets.', 'Jeffrey David Hammond', ""Just on second half Aero margins, I think you're guiding maybe flat to a little bit down. It seems like synergies are building. Just wondering, I think historically, your margins have kind of built through the year. Just how are you thinking about maybe any headwinds within second half versus first half Aero margins?"", 'Jennifer A. Parmentier', ""Yes, I would just start with, and then I can let Todd to add on. We had a really nice aftermarket mix in Q2 and in the first half, but really driven by favorable spares. So it's -- we didn't feel comfortable forecasting that into the second half, so that is some of it."", 'Todd M. Leombruno', ""Yes. We did call out some one-timers in Q1 that were margin positive. Q2 obviously was another great margin quarter. Jenny is absolutely right. That mix at 47%, we hope it remains there, but we didn't feel prudent to guide that way. And again, I just go back to, if you look at the second half there, those are record numbers when you look at what we're guiding to. So we feel like we can achieve them. There's just -- I can see a few more quarters at that level before we get overly confident."", 'Jeffrey David Hammond', ""Okay, that's great. And then just the backlog, I think you've said it's stable at a high level. I think you've given some stats around 30% and 50% for Industrial and 55% for overall, and that was kind of 2x. Are those kind of running at those same levels? Are we seeing any backlog drawdown?"", 'Jennifer A. Parmentier', ""No. I mean they're just exactly what you said, they're holding steady at those levels. And it is about twice of what we've seen in the past. So we feel really good about the quality of the backlog. I would tell you that we constantly analyze it and we do a lot of checks with our customers. But again, not seeing any major cancellations or pushouts at this time. So we think it's of good quality."", 'Operator', 'Our next question comes from Andrew Obin with Bank of America.', 'Andrew Burris Obin', 'I apologize for the confusion earlier. Just a question on pricing and inflation. I guess our channel work suggests that, just generally, fluid power pricing is running higher, I think, than we would have expected. In the new calendar year, what are your expectations? How your expectations about pricing are evolving? Any change to your framework? And what does it say about sort of just general inflationary environment for the industrials?', 'Jennifer A. Parmentier', ""So Andrew, this is Jenny. Just kind of a reminder with pricing, we went out early and often through some of these really historical inflationary times over the last couple of years. We are now back at our regular pricing cadence of January and July. And I would just say that the increase that we just did was very modest. I wouldn't consider it a higher increase for fluid power. So -- and that's what we -- barring any major changes, that's what we expect to see going into the future. So we still are in inflationary times. And there's some of those inflationary cost drivers that aren't going to reverse. So looking forward, this is what we see right now, but we'll continue to use the pricing tools that we've always used in the past."", 'Andrew Burris Obin', ""Got you. And just a follow-up, I think, on Meggitt synergies. I guess, just to clarify, you've raised the synergies from $150 million to $200 million cumulative. So should we think about it as a pull forward? Or is the $300 million target going higher because, clearly, Meggitt has been a big success for you, but just to understand what the formal framework is?"", 'Jennifer A. Parmentier', ""Consider it a pull forward. We originally said $75 million for this fiscal year. Now it's going to be that $50 million higher. So we're in a good position here. We remain committed to the $300 million by FY '26. We're just realizing some of that sooner."", 'Todd M. Leombruno', ""Diego, I'm being told that, that was the last question in the queue. So unless you see anything different, we will wrap up just a little bit early. I know it's a busy day out there for everyone. If you do need any follow-ups, Jeff Miller, our VP of Investor Relations; and Yan Huo, our Director of Investor Relations, certainly, will be available if you need any follow-ups. And as always, we appreciate your attention. Thank you for your support of Parker. And I hope everyone has a great day. Thanks."", 'Operator', ""Thank you. And that concludes today's conference. All parties may now disconnect. Have a great day.""]"

Reported EPS is $0.89, expectations were $0.88. Sysco Corporation isn’t one of the 30 most popular stocks among hedge funds at the end of the third quarter (see the details here).', ""Operator: Welcome to Sysco's Second Quarter Fiscal Year 2024 Conference Call. As a reminder, today's call is being recorded. We will begin with opening remarks and introductions. I would like to turn the call over to Kevin Kim, Vice President of Investor Relations.

Additionally, we want to make the audience aware of Sysco's participation at the CAGNY Investor Conference on February 20th and our Investor Day on May 22nd in New York."", ""We hope you can join these events in person or virtually. At this time, I'd like to turn the call over to Kevin Hourican."", ""Kevin Hourican: Thanks Kevin and good morning everyone. Thank you for joining our call today. I'm very pleased with Sysco's performance for the quarter. Our company is the market leader in a growing industry or size and scale matter. This past quarter, we demonstrated that important position of strength by delivering another quarter of double-digit earnings per share growth. Sysco delivered bottom-line growth through a combination of volume growth, disciplined margin management, and expense control. Our positive momentum from the first half of our fiscal year is expected to continue into the second half, and we remain confident in our full year growth expectations for sales and EPS. This includes 2024 adjusted EPS growth of 7% at the midpoint of our guidance range."", ""Sysco has improved how we leverage our scale through the Recipe for Growth strategy and we continue to deliver industry-leading profitability metrics as well as leverage our industry-leading strong balance sheet. Our confidence in the year has enabled us to increase our capital allocation to shareholders for the year. We are announcing today an increase of our stock buyback target for fiscal year 2024. We now expect to buy back approximately $1.25 billion of our stock this year up from our previously communicated $750 million. With the increased stock buyback and our industry-leading dividend yield, we will contribute more than $2.25 billion directly to our shareholders. Sysco's strong balance sheet and free cash flow enable us to make these types of shareholder-friendly decisions while providing ample liquidity to fund the long-term growth of our business."", ""We are, as we say, play from a position of strength. So let's get started with a brief highlight of the quarter on Slide number 5. Beginning with the top line, we delivered sales growth of 3.7%, a sequential improvement from Q1, driven by a combination of positive case volume growth and positive product cost inflation. Importantly, this included a sequential improvement in local case volume growth quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year. We will share more on that later. Turning to the bottom line, we posted over 11% growth in adjusted EPS, generating strong operating leverage. This is the fifth consecutive quarter of positive operating leverage and the 11th consecutive quarter of double-digit adjusted EPS growth. Kenny will provide more details in his financial section."", 'Today, I would like to update you on two topics I highlighted as priorities on our Q1 earnings call: Local case volume and supply chain productivity. During the quarter, we sequentially increased our case volume performance, growing our US foodservice segment 3.4% and delivering local case volume growth of 2.9%. We grew our market share profitably through our improvement efforts. Notably, this growth comes with the industry-leading profit margin rates you can expect from Sysco. The rate of volume growth does not include the benefit of Edward Don, which closed in late November, and we remain solidly on track to deliver our growth ambition versus the market this year. Importantly, the initiatives we outlined to drive local case performance earlier this year began to bear fruit this past quarter.', 'We are focused on improving sales execution. Our efforts are centered around properly serving our local customers in improving our local sales growth. A reminder of our local sales focus areas for fiscal 2024. First, we started adding incremental sales headcount in the second quarter and expect to continue hiring in the second half of fiscal year 2024 and in the coming years. The incremental headcount is targeted to optimize territory sizes and enhanced sales consultant effectiveness, demonstrating focused actions to deliver higher returns. The benefits from increasing our local salesforce will accrue over time as new colleagues complete their training, move up the productivity curve and settle into their territories. As previously indeed, we continue to expect to see the vast majority of the positive impact from our fiscal year 2024 hires impact fiscal year 2025 performance.', 'Second, we recently refined our compensation model to further motivate our sales consultants on win, win, win behaviors for Sysco, our customers and our salesforce. We can already see the impact of the compensation change, and we expect the impact of these recent changes to grow over time. We will continue to optimize our compensation program over time to ensure we are properly rewarding and motivating our sales team. Third, our focus on performance management continues with a hyper focus on customer visit frequency and sales consultant visit quality. These efforts are improving outcomes of our sales visits and can be closely tracked in our CRM tool. Leveraging technology to maximize the effectiveness of each customer visit remains a top priority and I am pleased with the impact of our sales leadership team in the past quarter.', ""Lastly, total team selling continues to gain traction. Our sales teams across broadline and specialty are working more collaboratively and we are leveraging our data to maximize the time allocation of our selling specialists in produce, protein and ethnic cuisine segments like Italian. All told, these interconnected actions increased our local case performance from Q1 to Q2 by 300 basis points. Importantly, the exit velocity of the quarter was even stronger as our performance improved each month of the quarter. We are confident in our ability to continue to grow local sales, while maintaining the positive momentum we have displayed in national sales. Next, I would like to provide an update on the progress we've been making within our supply chain."", 'We continue to improve the performance of our supply chain by focusing on operational excellence. Chart 9 displays our year-over-year operating profit improvement, driven by positive operating leverage, with gross profits growing at a faster rate than operating expenses. Our supply chain employees continue to move up the productivity curve due to improved colleague training and significantly improved levels of retention, especially within the driver position with improved retention comes improved outputs across the supply chain, lowering hiring expenses, lower training expenses, improved productivity, lower levels of product shrink, improved safety metrics and improved service levels to our customers. Each of these elements positively impact our P&L and the improvement drops straight to the bottom line.', 'We are extremely focused on continuing to improve colleague retention and productivity within our supply chain. Lastly, we continue to improve the rigor and discipline in our colleague staffing efforts. This includes better matching our hours worked to the volume of cases shipped and the difficult work of flexing down our staffing during lower volume periods. We will continue to refine our engineered labor standards that drive our staffing models, and we will increase the agility with which we match our staffing to our volume. Our Q2 results display a continuation of quarter-over-quarter progress in productivity gains, and we remain disciplined and focused on continuing that rate of improvement. These efforts will benefit the P&L in fiscal 2024 and will carry into 2025 and beyond.', 'We are bullish on our ability to continue to lower our cost to serve while simultaneously improving customer service levels. As I lift up from these two topics, improving sales effectiveness and improving our supply chain productivity, I would also like to communicate that we remain on track with our Recipe for Growth business transformation. Our digital efforts continue to advance. Our merchant teams continue to improve our product assortment, especially in Sysco brand. We are excited about the integration with Edward Don and how we can profitably grow our equipment and supplies business. We remain very pleased with the performance of our Greco Italian platform, and I am proud of our international business leaders for the compelling performance produced year-to-date from our International segment.', 'At our Investor Day in May, we will dive deeper into each of our Recipe for Growth pillars. Foodservice distribution is a space for size and scale matters, logistics scale, cold storage scale in both warehousing and transportation, technology scale, and sales force expertise and scale. We believe that no one is better positioned than Sysco to leverage global scale advantages in order to better serve customers and profitably grow the business. I am very pleased that fiscal 2024 is off to a strong start, as we are profitably growing our market share and continuing a track record of delivering compelling top and bottom-line growth. For the remainder of fiscal 2024, we remain hyper focused on the execution elements I highlighted today as well as advancing our Recipe for Growth strategy.', ""We are confident that these efforts will enable Sysco to deliver our financial plan. I'll now turn it over to Kenny, who will provide a more detailed review of our financial performance. Kenny, over to you."", ""Kenny Cheung: Thank you, Kevin and good morning everyone. I'm going to build upon Kevin's commentary with a couple of points. First, we have positive momentum as Q2 marked another milestone with record topline and bottom-line performance. Future results included sales and volume growth, along with strong cost of goods sold performance, resulting in adjusted gross profit dollar growth and margin expansion. Positive operating leverage was also driven by gross profit growing at a faster rate than operating expenses, demonstrating our disciplined margin management, which rendered adjusted EPS growth of over 11%. Second, we are excited about our first half performance and confidence in our positive momentum for the remainder of the year."", 'Therefore, we are increasing our share repurchases expectations from $750 million to $1.25 billion for FY 2024 versus the prior guidance. This will increase expected total shareholder returns, including dividends and share repurchases to approximately $2.25 billion for FY 2024. This is in addition to our continued reinvestment into the business, including M&A, such as the addition of BIX and Edward Don earlier this year. Capital allocation is a competitive advantage for Sysco as the strength of our balance sheet and free cash flow generation allows us to invest for growth and reward our shareholders at the same time. Now, turning to a summary of our reported results for the quarter, starting on Slide 13. For the second quarter, our enterprise sales grew 3.7%, with US foodservice growing 3.2%, international growing 9.6%, SYGMA and decreasing 1%, driven by planned exit of customers that did not meet our disciplined profit thresholds.', 'This planned exit along with strong supply chain productivity improvement, helped more than double our SYGMA profits this quarter, another prime example of our ROIC focus in action. Enterprise inflation was 1.1%. Additionally, US broadline inflation was slightly positive and our international segment was up 6.6%, all aligned with our expectations. Total US foodservice volume increased 3.4% and local volume was up 2.9%, a 300 bps sequential improvement from Q1. Please note, volume reporting includes slight benefits from the acquisition of BIX Produce. Our volume reporting does not include our Edward Don or Specialty Meat business based on their unique product attributes. We produced $3.5 billion in gross profit, up 4.9%. Adjusted gross margin improved to 18.2%, an increase of 21 bps.', 'Our gross profit dollar and margin percentage improvement reflected our ability to effectively manage product cost fluctuations driven by incremental progress from our strategic sourcing efforts and disciplined pricing. Penetration rates of Sysco brand products increased 22 bps to 46.9% in U.local and was essentially flat at 36.8% in US broadline. Overall, adjusted operating expense were $2.8 billion for the quarter or 14.4% of sales as we achieved another quarter of positive operating leverage. The strong management of expenses during the quarter was due to the positive impact of the variable labor planning tool and supply chain efficiencies that Kevin mentioned, and benefits from our previously announced $100 million of cost-out commitments.', 'We are on track to achieve this commitment for FY 2024 and the planning process for delivering incremental costs for future periods has already begun. Additionally, with the successful closure of our BIX and Edward Don acquisition, we are on pace to realize both top and bottom line synergies. Adjusted operating income growth of 7.6% in USFS, coupled with outsized profit contributions from our international and SYGMA segments, contributed to bottom line performance. Positive momentum continued in our International segment, with adjusted operating income growing 30.1% during the quarter. Our international results are a continuation of the robust growth and positive momentum in this segment over the past three years. The Recipe for Growth playbook is yielding dividends in the US and internationally.', 'In total, Q2 adjusted operating income was $745 million, up 9.2% and adjusted EBITDA was $927 million, up 11.6%. Turning to the balance sheet, which remains strong. We ended the quarter at 2.75 times net debt leverage ratio. This is in line with our target range of 2.5 to 2.75 times net debt leverage ratio. Our planned increase to the share repurchase program is already in action with an accelerated share repurchase program that was executed in early January. We ended the quarter with $11.2 billion in net debt that is well laddered and over $3.4 billion in total liquidity. Approximately 96% of our debt is fixed with the floating component offset by our cash reserves. Our strong investment-grade credit rating is a competitive advantage as evidenced by our team successfully issuing approximately $1 billion of new debt in November.', 'We are committed to our capital allocation strategy as seen on Slide 19, which includes a balanced approach with three elements: First, investing in the business for profitable and consistent growth; second, maintaining our investment-grade credit rating; and third, returning cash to shareholders, through dividends and share repurchases. Turning to our first half cash flow. We generated $856 million in operating cash flow and $527 million in free cash flow, growing 70% and 141%, respectively. This growth includes continued strong conversion rates from EBITDA to operating cash and free cash flow, and we remain on track to grow free cash flow for full year FY 2024. Our strong financial position enabled us to return $353 million to shareholders via share repurchases and dividends this quarter.', ""Looking forward to fiscal year 2024 guidance, we are reiterating net sales growth of mid-single digits to approximately $80 billion. Adjusted EPS is expected to grow to $4.20 to $4.40. This represents a 7% growth at the midpoint. Additionally, we expect positive operating leverage with gross profit growing at a faster rate than OpEx for the year. We continue to expect slightly positive rates of industry volume growth and inflation. This includes Sysco's US broadline remaining inflationary in the second half of the fiscal year. Our planned top line also includes benefits from M&A activity consistent with previous disclosures for an average annual contribution of 50 to 100 basis points of growth. We will continue to opportunistically evaluate accretive acquisitions, but the remainder of FY 2024 will focus on integration efforts, capturing synergies for accretive acquisitions like Don and returning excess cash back to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends."", 'For the second half and over the long-term, we expect to win market share, profitably and consistently. Our efforts will also focus on strong cash generation with conversion rates, ultimately feeding our plans to grow and reward our shareholders. Thank you for your time today. With that, operator, we are now ready for questions.', 'See also Light Street Capital Returned 46% in 2023: Top 15 Picks and 25 Most Innovative Economies in 2024: Why WIPO Rankings Are Inaccurate.', 'To continue reading the Q&A session, please click here.']"

', 'The case for Procter & Gamble is simple enough. The company is part of the consumer staples sector. It has products consumers need, not want. And in many cases, consumers are still loyal to the company’s popular brands even when they are competing with generic or house brands.', 'PG stock is up about 66% in the last five years. Some years (2020 and 2021) have been great. In 2022, not so much. The average gain of about 13% stock price growth every year is not going to beat the markets in many years, but P&G is still a reliable, long-term investment. ', 'And even in the years when the stock doesn’t perform as well, the stock has a solid, and growing dividend. P&G is part of the exclusive Dividend Kings club having increased its dividend for 68 consecutive years. ', 'Source: RAMAN SHAUNIA / Shutterstock.com', 'Verizon Communications (NYSE:VZ) is proof that boring can be beautiful. The wireless business is a tough business model in the best of times. But it’s also a reliable business model. And with about 28% of market share, investors can count on consistency quarter after quarter. ', 'VZ stock is down about 25% in the last five years. Much of that has been because the company was spending money to build out its 5G infrastructure. But analysts bidding up the stock is a good sign that investors are betting that the company is about finished with that spending. That should allow for stock price appreciation in the coming years. ', 'That stock price growth will pair nicely with a juicy dividend that currently has a\xa0yield of over 6% and the company has increased that dividend in each of the last 19 years. With the company’s cash flow likely to increase in coming years, more dividend growth is a near certainty.

As a lawyer, activist, and executive at nonprofit organizations, he sued cigarette makers, cultivated whistleblowers, and led the campaign to ban smoking on airlines.', 'Which is why allies in the anti-smoking movement were surprised when in October he became CEO of the Foundation for a Smoke-Free World, a nonprofit created and entirely funded by Philip Morris International, one of the world’s largest tobacco companies.', 'Douglas, who previously worked for the American Cancer Society and the American Lung Association, sees his new job as the continuation of his anti-smoking work. He joined the foundation only after its board agreed to make a clean break from Philip Morris. He wants to bring together foundations, nonprofits, public health experts, elected officials, regulators, and academics in a renewed effort to curb death and disease caused by smoking.', 'It won’t be easy. Because anti-smoking groups aren’t just fighting the tobacco companies these days. They’re fighting, sometimes bitterly, among themselves.', '“I’m under no illusions about the challenges,” Douglas says.', 'The stakes are high. Smoking remains the leading cause of preventable death in the United States, killing about 480,000 people a year, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. To succeed, Douglas will have to work through what he calls the “very fraught, polarized environment” that hampers the nonprofits, foundations, governments, and academics who work on tobacco control. They have fractured over tobacco harm reduction — the idea that people who cannot or will not quit smoking should be provided with alternatives, notably e-cigarettes, which deliver nicotine without burning tobacco.', 'Bloomberg Philanthropies and the nonprofits it supports — the Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids and long-established groups like the American Cancer Society, the American Lung Association, and the American Heart Association — have campaigned relentlessly to limit access to e-cigarettes. The Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids has focused on what it continues to describe as a “youth e-cigarette epidemic,” even though vaping by teens has fallen by more than 60% since its peak in 2019. They argue that e-cigarettes will lead to a new generation addicted to nicotine, even if they are not smoking.', 'Backed by $300 million in Bloomberg philanthropic money, along with political donations from Michael Bloomberg, the anti-vaping groups have helped convince five states – California, Massachusetts, New Jersey, New York, and Rhode Island – to ban the sale of flavored e-cigarettes. The nonprofit Truth Initiative goes further, saying it is “committed to making tobacco use and nicotine addiction a thing of the past,” which would require removing all e-cigarettes from the market. Some cities, including San Francisco, have already done so.', 'Douglas and his allies in the harm reduction camp say that’s been nothing short of disastrous. Bans on flavored e-cigarettes, which now cover nearly 40% of the United States, have been associated with increased sales of conventional cigarettes, according to several academic studies and financial analysts.', '“These bans disincentivize the far safer product and move people back to a product that’s going to kill one in two of them,” Douglas says.', 'The argument threatens to derail progress on one of the most successful public health campaigns in history. The percentage of Americans who smoke has dropped from 42% in 1964 — when the first Surgeon General’s report warned of the dangers of smoking — to less than 12%. But the arrival of e-cigarettes fractured opponents of smoking, especially after startup company JUUL marketed its vapes with high nicotine levels to young people, infuriating activists and regulators.', '“I can’t think of any other field of public health that has been so divided,” says Charles Gardner, a former program officer at the Foundation for a Smoke Free World and a global-health expert who previously worked at the Rockefeller and UBS Optimus foundations.', 'Tobacco money', 'The mission of the Foundation for a Smoke Free World, which Philip Morris started in 2017, is to reduce deaths and diseases caused by smoking. It focuses largely, but not entirely, on reduced-risk nicotine products, a category that includes e-cigarettes, oral tobacco, and “heat not burn” products that warm up tobacco without burning it.', 'This aligns with the goals of the company, which says that its future depends on replacing cigarettes with the smoke-free products that it sells. Philip Morris International promised that the foundation would be independent and said it would fund it with $80 million a year for 12 years.', 'Anti-smoking groups called the foundation a public relations stunt, noting that the tobacco industry has a long history of creating front groups to push its agenda. Joanna Cohen, a professor of disease prevention at the Bloomberg School of Public Health at Johns Hopkins University, and Ellen MacKenzie, the school’s dean, urged universities and nonprofits around the world to shun the foundation.', 'Douglas says the company has no influence over the foundation. All ties with Philip Morris were severed after accepting $122.5 million, which he characterized as a severance payment.', 'But some anti-tobacco advocates remain skeptical. Yolonda Richardson, president of the Campaign for Tobacco Free Kids, and Deborah Arnott, chief executive of a British health charity called Action on Smoking and Health, told Reuters that the foundation was tainted by accepting tobacco money and could not be seen as independent.', 'Douglas would like his critics to reserve judgment. “I’m asking those who feel doubt at this early stage to not merely rely on what I say but to watch what we do,” he says.', 'Vaping vs. Smoking', 'What, then, will the foundation do?', 'Douglas intends to correct widespread and dangerous misunderstandings about the relative risks of conventional cigarettes, e-cigarettes, and nicotine. There are no safe tobacco products; all fall along what’s called a continuum of risk. Nicotine pouches and gums are widely accepted because, unlike e-cigarettes, they have been approved as smoking-cessation medicines by the FDA.', 'That said, the vast majority of scientific experts and government agencies, including the Centers for Disease Control, say that vaping is safer than smoking, although its long-term effects remain unknown.', 'Public-opinion surveys, however, show that Americans mistakenly believe that e-cigarettes are as harmful or more harmful than conventional cigarettes. Misinformed smokers, therefore, have no reason to switch to the safer product.', 'Surprisingly, physicians are also misinformed. Surveys of doctors in the United States and around the world have found that most blame nicotine for many of the negative health consequences of smoking. Nicotine is addictive, but other chemicals and carcinogens, particularly those produced by combustion, are the primary causes of tobacco-related disease and death.', '“Doctors understand that you shouldn’t be smoking,” says Michael Cummings, a tobacco-control expert at the Medical University of South Carolina. “Unfortunately, they’ve been sold a bill of goods on vaping.”', 'Misperceptions affect not only patients and the advice they get from doctors but also the beliefs and actions of elected officials who favor an abstinence-only approach to nicotine.', '“Misunderstanding leads to poor policy,” Douglas says. While concerns about the long-term effects of vaping are valid, studies show that people who switch from conventional cigarettes to smoke-free nicotine products show immediate decreases in biomarkers associated with disease in their blood and urine.', 'More than anything else, Douglas would like to find common ground with the Bloomberg-funded groups around policies that would keep tobacco and nicotine products away from kids while helping adults kick their smoking habit.', '______', 'Marc Gunther is a contributor at the Chronicle of Philanthropy, where you can read the full article.

On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.', ""While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call, it's worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise."", 'Zacks Consensus Estimate', 'This seller of Marlboro and other cigarette brands is expected to post quarterly earnings of $1.44 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +3.6%.', 'Revenues are expected to be $8.93 billion, up 9.6% from the year-ago quarter.', 'Estimate Revisions Trend', 'The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 0.71% higher over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.', 'Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change.', 'Earnings Whisper', ""Estimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. Our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) -- has this insight at its core."", 'The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.', ""Thus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only."", 'A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.', 'Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).', 'How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Philip Morris?', ""For Philip Morris, the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of -0.50%."", 'On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #3.', 'So, this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Philip Morris will beat the consensus EPS estimate.', 'Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?', ""Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number."", 'For the last reported quarter, it was expected that Philip Morris would post earnings of $1.61 per share when it actually produced earnings of $1.67, delivering a surprise of +3.73%.', 'Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times.', 'Bottom Line', 'An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.', ""That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported."", ""Philip Morris doesn't appear a compelling earnings-beat candidate.

But the reality is that when a company loses money each year, for long enough, its investors will usually take their share of those losses. A loss-making company is yet to prove itself with profit, and eventually the inflow of external capital may dry up."", ""If this kind of company isn't your style, you like companies that generate revenue, and even earn profits, then you may well be interested in Roper Technologies (NASDAQ:ROP). While this doesn't necessarily speak to whether it's undervalued, the profitability of the business is enough to warrant some appreciation - especially if its growing."", ' See our latest analysis for Roper Technologies ', ""If a company can keep growing earnings per share (EPS) long enough, its share price should eventually follow. So it makes sense that experienced investors pay close attention to company EPS when undertaking investment research. Shareholders will be happy to know that Roper Technologies' EPS has grown 26% each year, compound, over three years. If the company can sustain that sort of growth, we'd expect shareholders to come away satisfied."", ""One way to double-check a company's growth is to look at how its revenue, and earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) margins are changing. Roper Technologies maintained stable EBIT margins over the last year, all while growing revenue 15% to US$6.2b. That's encouraging news for the company!"", ""You can take a look at the company's revenue and earnings growth trend, in the chart below.

Notably, they have an enviable stake in the company, worth US$245m. We note that this amounts to 0.4% of the company, which may be small owing to the sheer size of Roper Technologies but it's still worth mentioning. This should still be a great incentive for management to maximise shareholder value."", ""You can't deny that Roper Technologies has grown its earnings per share at a very impressive rate. That's attractive. Further, the high level of insider ownership is impressive and suggests that the management appreciates the EPS growth and has faith in Roper Technologies' continuing strength.

Joining me on the call this morning are Neil Hunn, President and Chief Executive Officer; Jason Conley, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; Brandon Cross, Vice President and Principal Accounting Officer; and Shannon O'Callaghan, Vice President of Finance. Earlier this morning, we issued a press release announcing our financial results. The press release also includes replay information for today's call.

Today, we will discuss our results primarily on an adjusted non-GAAP and continuing operations basis.

And lastly, transaction-related expenses associated with our completed acquisitions."", ""Reconciliations can be found in our press release and in the appendix of this presentation on our website. And now if you please turn to Page 4, I'll hand the call over to Neil. After our prepared remarks, we will take questions from our telephone participants. Neil?"", ""Neil Hunn: Thank you, Zack, and thanks to everyone for joining our call. We're looking forward to sharing our quite good 2023 fourth quarter and full-year results with you this morning. As we turn to Page 5, let's look at today's agenda. This morning, I'll start by walking through our full-year highlights and then we'll turn to commenting on our most recent acquisition, Procare Solutions. Jason will then go through our quarterly results, both in aggregate and at the segment level, share our annual results and review our strong balance sheet position, then I'll pick up and discuss our segment level annual results, our 2024 outlook, wrap up, and turn to your questions. Let's go ahead and get started. Next slide, please. As we turn to Page 5, the two key takeaways for today's call are; first, we delivered a very strong 2023; and second, we remain well-positioned and are carrying positive momentum into 2024."", ""As we look back on the full-year, we're proud of what the organization accomplished. From a financial perspective, we delivered 15% revenue growth, 16% EBITDA growth and 32% free cash flow growth, with free cash flow margins at 32%. Our total revenue growth of 15% was underpinned with 8% organic revenue growth. Jason will cover this in a few minutes, but Q4 was strong as well with 13% total revenue growth and 8% organic revenue growth. Also during the year, we deployed $2.1 billion in the high-quality vertical software acquisitions, highlighted by our bolt-on acquisitions of Syntellis and Replicon. As we all know, last year was a challenged year relative to available acquisition opportunities, given that I'm super-proud of our team's ability to grind through the market conditions and successfully convert two outstanding value-creation M&A opportunities."", 'Given all this, we entered this year with positive momentum. We continue to see strong demand for our mission-critical solutions. As a reminder, each of our businesses is a leader in their respective market and delivers system of record, network critical or vital and-or lifesaving technologies. As a result, we continue to see strong demand for our solutions. Also as we head into 2024, we have meaningful contributions from our recent acquisitions, Syntellis, Replicon, and Procare. It is important to highlight these additions to our portfolio of businesses also improved the underlying quality of our enterprise in terms of reoccurring revenue mix and organic growth profile. Finally, we continue to be very active in the M&A market, in environment that we expect to be notably improved in 2024 with a strong balance sheet and a large pipeline of attractive opportunities.', ""So, a strong '23 and solid momentum both organic and inorganic behind us as we enter 2024. Now please turn to the next page, Page 6, where I will discuss our most recent acquisition, Procare Solutions. Procare Solutions is a fantastic addition to the Roper portfolio. Let's start with the fundamentals. We're paying $1.75 billion net of $110 million tax benefit for the business. We expect Procare to contribute about $260 million of revenue and $95 million of EBITDA for the 12 months ended Q1 '25. Procare will be accretive to our free cash flow in '24 and to our adjusted DEPS in '25. We will fund the acquisition with a portion of our $3.5 billion revolver, and we'll report Procare in our Application Software segment and expect the deal to close this quarter."", ""Procare meets all our longstanding acquisition criteria, leader in a smaller market, delivers mission-critical verticalized software solutions, competes based on customer intimacy, operates in asset-light business model, and is led by a skilled passionate leadership team. What' incrementally different for us is the maturing leader nature of this company. As we outlined during our Investor Day last year, our corporate strategy leans on implementing two modest improvements. First, continue to improve our long-term sustainable organic growth rate. And second, capture more value from our capital appointment capacity. Relative to additional capital deployment value capture, we are focusing on doing a higher proportion of bolt-on activity as evidenced by last year's capital deployment records and adding higher-growth or maturing leader business profiles to our enterprise."", ""Procare is a prototypical maturing leader archetype, meeting all our longstanding criteria that I mentioned above, but as structurally faster growth business that possesses the opportunity to improve margins as the top-line scales. For Procare, we expect mid-teens top-line growth with improving margins from an already strong position for the years to come. Let's talk about what the company does. Procare is the leading provider of mission-critical and purpose-built software to 37,000 owners and operators of early childhood education centers which they used to run their business. The software provides all the needed functionality to run the childcare center ranging from parents and family engagement, staff and teachers scheduling, classroom management, tuition billing and payment processing."", 'The market itself is quite attractive. And in the midst of a long-term secular tailwind of young dual income families seeking higher levels of early childhood education versus daycare. In addition, like most industries, this one is undergoing long-term tech-enablement. Given these factors, this market is growing annually in the low double digits area. As mentioned, Procare is the leading player with a 1.5 times through all their market-share advantage in this space given their super compelling value proposition that combines both software and the integrated payment capabilities. Given this, Procare has very high gross retention and compelling net retention as well. Finally, from a extensive due diligence of the business, we are encouraged by the fact that Procare has multiple strategic and operating pathways available to deliver mid-teens growth and long-term margin expansion.', 'Net-net, this is a highly compelling value creation opportunity for Roper, and our shareholders. And to Joanne, your leadership team and all the Procare family, welcome to Roper. So with that, Jason, let me turn the call over to you so you can walk-through our fourth quarter and full-year results, as well as our very strong financial position. Jason?', ""Jason Conley: Great. Thanks, Neil. I'll walk-through the enterprise and segment results for Q4, and enterprise results for the full-year along with a review of our balance sheet. Starting with Q4 on Slide 7. We had an excellent finish to a strong year, revenue over $1.6 billion was 13% over prior year, led by 8% organic growth with acquisitions adding four points and less than a point of currency benefit. Organic outperformance was led by our TEP segment, highlighted by Neptune and Verathon. Gross margin of 69.7% was down 30 basis points versus prior year given the higher mix coming from our TEP segment. EBITDA grew 11% to $659 million with EBITDA margin coming in at a solid 40.8%. With the offsetting impact of interest and taxes, this translated into DEPS growth of 11% to $4.37, above our guidance range of $4.28 to $4.32."", ""Also from a cash perspective, free cash flow finished strong at $596 million, up 30% over prior year. This was in-line with our expectations with a good renewal season across our software businesses. We turn to Slide 8, I'll briefly click into the segment performance in Q4. Application Software delivered revenue growth of 15% over prior year to $852 million with organic growth contributing seven points and the balance coming primarily from our bolt-on acquisitions of Syntellis and Replicon. EBITDA margin of 43.2% in the quarter was below prior year's high watermark of 45.6%, which as we discussed last year, was driven by lower incentive-based compensation. Network Software was up 3% to $363 million with EBITDA up 10% to $208 million. As we have discussed before, our freight matching businesses are navigating a drawdown of carriers, following exceptional marketplace growth over 2021 and 2022, which is mixing down the growth rate for the segment."", ""However, our business leaders DAT and Loadlink have aligned the cost base with reduced carrier subscribers to still drive solid EBITDA growth in the quarter. Our TEP segment grew by 17% in the quarter to $399 million with EBITDA of 13% to a $134 million. Growth was led by exceptional performance at Neptune, with continued increasing demand for ultrasonic technologies and overall favorable market conditions. Also Verathon continued its remarkable growth with strengthened single-use products across Laryngoscopy and Bronchoscopy. EBITDA margin of 33.6% was down from prior year given some one-time investments and incentive compensation in the quarter. Turning to Slide 9, I'll walk through our full-year 2023 performance. As Neil just mentioned, revenue was just under $6.2 billion, up 15% over prior year with organic growth of 8% and acquisitions contributing seven points, mainly Frontline and Syntellis."", ""Looking at a three-year revenue CAGR on this slide, similar to 2023, it's also at 15%. Further, the organic -- average organic growth rate over the three-year period has been about 8%. So as Neil mentioned, we benefited from some market conditions over that time period. EBITDA of just over $2.5 billion was up 16% over prior year yielding EBITDA margin of 40.6%. Our three-year EBITDA over this period was also up 16%. So the story remains the same at Roper. We own and continually grow a portfolio of high gross margin businesses and generally convert EBITDA -- growth to EBITDA in the 45% range, which allows for ample investment back into the business for future sustainable growth. Free cash flow for the year was just shy of $2 billion, which represents a 32% margin and is coincidentally up 32% over 2022."", 'Full-year contribution from our Frontline acquisition and excellent performance across the enterprise drove this result, underpinned by strong renewals, favorable DSO and improving inventory turns. Of note, our net working capital as a percent of annualized revenue was negative 19% in Q4 to the new record for Roper. Importantly, over a three-year period, we have compounded cash flow at 16%. Our consistent focus on growing cash flow and the strength of our new portfolio following our divestitures demonstrates a solid base from which to continue our long-term growth algorithm. To that end, we expect free cash flow margin to be 30% or more in 2024. With that, we can flip to Slide 10 to discuss our strong financial position. From a liquidity standpoint, we finished the year with $3.14 billion available on our revolver, with over $200 million of cash.', ""Regarding leverage, we brought down net-debt to EBITDA from 2.7 times at the beginning of 2023, to a year end figure of 2.4 times despite deploying $2.1 billion towards acquisitions. We expect to close on Procare later in Q1 and will utilize our revolver to fund the transaction. So this will be our pro-forma leverage to about 3 times. Our solid balance sheet coupled with strong cash generation gives us capacity to deploy $4 billion or more of capital, while remaining committed to our solid investment-grade rating. Since our October call, deal activity has demonstrably increased with a corresponding lift in asset quality. That said, our market optimism remains balanced by our disciplined process in patient posture. With that, I'll turn the call back over to Neil to talk about our full-year segment performance and the indications for 2024."", 'Neil?', ""Neil Hunn: Thanks, Jason. As we turn to Page 12, let's look-back on the year for our Application Software segment. Total revenues grew 21% and organic revenues grew 6% to $3.19 billion, while EBITDA margins remained strong at 43.7%. Within the segment, results were consistent with strength at Deltek, Aderant, Vertafore, Strata and Frontline. Deltek continued to see strong gains in our SaaS solutions, especially in the private sector markets. As discussed throughout the year, the GovCon market was tempered given all the uncertainty regarding government spending, notwithstanding Deltek delivered mid-single-digit organic growth for the year. In addition, they continue to innovate and add capabilities during times of uncertainty, which is a hallmark of Roper strategy, highlighted by the bolt-ons of Replicon and ProPricer."", ""ProPricer, a smaller transaction about $80 million purchase price that closed late last year and delivers the leading contract pricing solutions and software for government contractors and federal agencies, an ideal strategic fit for Deltek's cost point product family. Aderant was just amazing last year. They had record bookings and significant adoption of their anchor SaaS solutions and add-on products. Also, Aderant is one of the leaders within Roper and the legal software market as it relates to productizing generative AI solutions within their product stack. Great job by Chris, Rossi, and the entire team at Aderant. Continuing on, Vertafore was solid with strong ARR gains throughout the year. Additionally, Vertafore made great strides with our product strategy deployment and the MGA systems bolt-on is trending well-ahead of our investment case."", ""Strata also was quite good last year, both in terms of organic ARR gains, and their acquisition and integration work associated with Syntellis. Finally, Frontline executed well, delivering strong retention and cash flow during the year. As I mentioned earlier, we will report Procare solutions in this segment and expect the deal to close this quarter. As it relates to our 2024 outlook for this segment, we expect to see mid-single-digit organic revenue growth. Please turn with us to Page 13. Full-year organic revenue for our Network segment grew 5% to $1.44 billion and margins were strong at 55.2%. We'll start with our freight matching businesses, DAT and Loadlink, which both grew in the year despite the year long muted freight market conditions."", 'Similar to that of Deltek, both businesses continue to innovate during the sluggish market with particularly interesting Gen AI innovations at DAT to help combat industry fraud. Pipeline delivered record bookings and had very strong customer retention and expansion activity, leading to strong ARR growth. Foundry, our post-production media and entertainment software business muscled through the year given the writers and actors strikes and made meaningful progress in the transition to a full subscription revenue model. Finally, our alternate site healthcare businesses, MHA, SoftWriters and SHP were strong throughout the year as census levels and senior care facilities improved. As it relates to our full-year 2024 guide for the segment, we expect to see low-single digit organic revenue growth based on the expectation of continued muted freight market conditions, but with continued strong EBITDA margin performance.', ""Now please turn to Page 14 and let's review our TEPs segment's results. Organic revenues for the year grew 15% to $1.55 billion and EBITDA margins remain consistent at 35.3%. As we look back over the year, we entered the year with a high degree of supply-chain uncertainty. During the year, the vast majority of these uncertainties are resolved and our business has done a tremendous job of capturing the opportunity. As we exit '23 and look to '24, we do not see meaningful supply chain constraints. As usual, we'll start with Neptune, our water meter and technology business. Neptune was just great and continues to see strong demand and momentum for their residential and commercial ultrasonic or static meters, and increasing adoption of their meter meter data management software."", ""We remain bullish about Neptune and the market in which they compete. Verathon was awesome as well for the year. Verathon was strong across all three of their product families, ultrasonic, bladder volume measurement, video-assisted intubation and single-use Bronchoscopy. As. As a reminder Verathon's reoccurring single-use offerings now make up about 55% of the business' annual revenue stream. Just an amazing product and business execution journey to both scale and improve the underlying quality of the business. Finally, our RF product businesses, Inovonics and rf IDEAS did a terrific job managing through their supply chain challenges and delivered very strong 2023 financial performance. Looking to our 2024 guidance for this segment, we expect to see high single-digit organic revenue growth for the full-year, and the expectation that Q1 will grow in the mid-teens area."", ""Now please turn with us to Page 16. This morning, we're establishing our 2024 full-year and first quarter guidance. For the full-year, which includes the impact of Procare solutions, we expect to see total revenue growth between 11% and 12%. On an organic basis, we expect to see full-year 2024 revenue grow between 5% and 6%. And finally, we expect to see full-year adjusted DEPS to be in the range of $17.85 - $18.15, which includes about $0.10 to $0.15 of DEPS dilution associated with the Procare deal. Assumed in this guidance, the tax rate in the 21% to 22% range. We want to take a moment, set our guide in context of our long-term strategy and execution model. To remind everyone, historically we operate at a 5% to 6% organic growth portfolio."", ""Our strategy and ambition to structurally improve organic growth rate to be in the 8% to 9% area. Over the last three years, we grew 8%, 9% and 8% on an organic basis. So these years were benefited to some extent from certain market conditions. As such, our view is our current course and speed of organic growth rate is in the 7% to 7.5% area. We are very pleased with our progress to date and continue to work to achieve organic growth aspirations. As it relates to organic revenue outlook for '24, we enter the year mindful of two factors; continued subdued large customer activity in our Application Software segment and our freight matching businesses within our Network segment being below trend based on our expectations for continued muted freight market conditions."", ""As it relates to the first quarter, we expect to see adjusted DEPS in the range of $4.30 and $4.34. Now please turn with us to Page 17, and then we'll look-forward to your questions. As per our custom, we'll will conclude with the same key takeaways with which we started. One, we delivered another great year performance. And two, we have continued positive momentum heading into 2024. Relative to 2023s performance, we delivered 15% revenue growth, 16% EBITDA growth and 32% free cash flow growth, with free cash flow margins also at 32%. Our total revenue growth of 15% was underpinned by 8% organic revenue growth. Importantly, free cash flow was growing 16% on a three-year compounded basis and we delivered our first-ever quarter of a $1 billion of software recurring and reoccurring revenues, quite an important milestone for enterprise."", ""In addition, we deployed $2.1 billion towards high-quality vertical software acquisitions, highlighted by our bolt-ons of Syntellis and Replicon, and year we're deploying capital was structurally challenged and we did so at very compelling values, leading the strong value creation for shareholders. As we enter 2024, we do so with strong momentum. We continue to see robust demand for our mission-critical solutions, a strong outlook for organic growth. Also, you can count on Roper to improve the underlying business quality as we scale our enterprise. Adding to the momentum for the year are the contributions from our 2023 acquisition cohort and last week's announcement of Procare Solutions. Finally, we are well-positioned to continue our capital deployment execution."", ""We remain very active in the M&A market and environment that expect to be notably improved in 2024. We do this with a strong balance sheet, a large pipeline of attractive opportunities and unwavering levels of patience and discipline. Now as we turn to your questions and if you can flip to the final slide, our strategic flywheel. We'd like to remind everyone that what we do at Roper is simple. We compound cash flow over a long arc of time by operating a portfolio of market-leading application-specific and vertically oriented businesses. Once the company is part of Roper, we operate a decentralized environment so our businesses can compete and win based on customer intimacy. We coach our businesses on how to structurally improve the organic growth rates and underlying business quality."", ""Finally, we run a centralized process-driven capital deployment strategy that focuses on finding the next great business to add to our cash flow compounding flywheel.

HCA Healthcare reported US$65b in revenue, roughly in line with analyst forecasts, although statutory earnings per share (EPS) of US$18.97 beat expectations, being 4.2% higher than what the analysts expected. Earnings are an important time for investors, as they can track a company's performance, look at what the analysts are forecasting for next year, and see if there's been a change in sentiment towards the company. We've gathered the most recent statutory forecasts to see whether the analysts have changed their earnings models, following these results."", ' View our latest analysis for HCA Healthcare ', ""Taking into account the latest results, the consensus forecast from HCA Healthcare's 21 analysts is for revenues of US$68.7b in 2024.

Yet prior to the latest earnings, the analysts had been anticipated revenues of US$67.7b and earnings per share (EPS) of US$19.66 in 2024. So the consensus seems to have become somewhat more optimistic on HCA Healthcare's earnings potential following these results."", ""The consensus price target rose 7.6% to US$317, suggesting that higher earnings estimates flow through to the stock's valuation as well. The consensus price target is just an average of individual analyst targets, so - it could be handy to see how wide the range of underlying estimates is. Currently, the most bullish analyst values HCA Healthcare at US$360 per share, while the most bearish prices it at US$250. This shows there is still a bit of diversity in estimates, but analysts don't appear to be totally split on the stock as though it might be a success or failure situation."", ""Taking a look at the bigger picture now, one of the ways we can understand these forecasts is to see how they compare to both past performance and industry growth estimates. We can infer from the latest estimates that forecasts expect a continuation of HCA Healthcare'shistorical trends, as the 5.8% annualised revenue growth to the end of 2024 is roughly in line with the 6.4% annual growth over the past five years. Compare this with the broader industry, which analyst estimates (in aggregate) suggest will see revenues grow 6.4% annually. So although HCA Healthcare is expected to maintain its revenue growth rate, it's only growing at about the rate of the wider industry."", ""The biggest takeaway for us is the consensus earnings per share upgrade, which suggests a clear improvement in sentiment around HCA Healthcare's earnings potential next year. Happily, there were no real changes to revenue forecasts, with the business still expected to grow in line with the overall industry. There was also a nice increase in the price target, with the analysts clearly feeling that the intrinsic value of the business is improving."", 'Keeping that in mind, we still think that the longer term trajectory of the business is much more important for investors to consider.

Good morning to everybody, and thank you for joining the call. We finished 2023 better than expected across most dimensions of our business. In the quarter, we experienced strong demand for services across our diversified portfolio of markets, facilities and service lines. This growth, coupled with improved cost trends drove solid financial performance in the fourth quarter. Diluted earnings per share, excluding gains on sales were $5.90, which represented a 27% increase over prior year. We are encouraged by these results and believe the operational momentum we have created should position us well for 2024. As mentioned at our recent Investor Day, the staying power of HCA Healthcare was on display again throughout the year.', 'Diluted earnings per share excluding gains and losses on sales and debt retirement for the year grew almost 13% as compared to 2022. As a management team, we pride ourselves on the following: first, owning our realities, whatever they are; next, making a big company small so we can adjust timely; and third, being disciplined in thought, resource allocation and execution, helping us to accomplish our mission. Once again, I believe our people have impressively demonstrated these traits in the face of new challenges and delivered positive outcomes for our patients, the communities we serve and our other stakeholders. I often refer to them as can do people. And again, this past year, I think they proved it. I want to thank them for their hard work and everything they do for our company.', ""Same-facility volumes across the company were strong in the fourth quarter. Admissions grew 3% year-over-year. Equivalent admissions were up 4%, emergency room visits grew 2%. Inpatient and outpatient surgery volumes increased approximately 1%. Most of our other volume categories, including cardiac procedures and rehab admissions had solid growth metrics in the quarter also. All domestic divisions had equivalent admissions growth in the quarter. Additionally, payer mix and acuity levels in the quarter improved year-over-year. These factors, along with certain enhancements in a couple of states' Medicaid supplemental programs helped produce same facilities revenue growth of 11% in the quarter. Bill will provide more detail on revenue in his comments."", 'Operating margins improved in the quarter as we were able to generate solid operating leverage across the company on the increased revenue we produced as compared to the prior year, but even more impressively when compared sequentially to the third quarter. We executed well over the year on our people agenda. In the quarter, we saw further progress on key metrics as evidenced by solid employee engagement results, stable turnover trends and reductions in contract labor utilization. As we have detailed in the past, we have implemented a comprehensive human resources plan. We expect to make further progress on it as we move into 2024. Our plan will remain a top organizational priority with significant investments in workforce development and trainings, which includes expansions in both Galen College of Nursing and our centers for clinical advancement.', 'With respect to hospital-based physician costs in the quarter, we slowed the rate of growth. As it pertains to Valesco, our physician staffing joint venture, we reduced the operating loss in the fourth quarter, more in line with our expectations. As indicated at our Investor Day, we expect to invest significantly this year in our long-term plans, which we designed to take our company from strength to strength and achieve the growth potential we see in our core business. These investments revolve around three distinct opportunities. The first one includes continued network expansion in facilities, services and workforce to meet the demand growth that we expect in our markets while also supporting our efforts to increase market share. In 2024, we have over $2 billion of new capital projects scheduled to come online that will increase capacities.', 'Additionally, we expect to integrate a number of newly acquired hospitals and outpatient facilities that should complement our networks. The second opportunity includes a robust agenda designed to advance digital capabilities across the company and unlock the embedded value we see in our operations. As high performing as we are today, we believe there is more operational potential inside our company with evolving technological tools we are investing to unlock this value. We believe this initiative, together with our care transformation and innovation program will enhance quality, drive further efficiencies through our financial resiliency program and improve overall operational management capabilities, including integrating our revenue cycle and case management functions better.', 'The third area of opportunity pertains to the flexibility we have to use our balance sheet position and strong cash flow production to invest heavily in our business and in our people while also allocating capital to our shareholders. In 2024, we plan to increase capital spending to over $5 billion and enhance our share repurchase program to around $5 billion. We continue to believe this strategic plan will produce more winning play for our organization, allowing us to deliver better services for patients while also creating value for other stakeholders. Let me close with this, the constants in our organization consists of three principles: giving our patients what they deserve whenever they need services, partnering with our physicians to deliver high-quality outcomes and leveraging the distinct elements of HCA Healthcare to improve performance.', ""Our approach to delivering on these core values comes from what we term the HCA way. That is supporting our local provider systems with value-added enterprise-level capabilities coupled with disciplined and detailed oriented management teams that relentlessly focus on execution. This operating philosophy has helped us navigate different economic cycles, adapt to changes in the industry and address challenges such as the COVID pandemic. As we look to the future, we have designed our next-generation growth plan to build upon the strengths we have developed over the years and take advantage of the opportunities in front of us. I am proud of HCA Healthcare and I'm even more proud of our people. We will move into 2024 in the years ahead with greater purpose with a renewed agenda to drive sustained growth and with confidence in our ability to deliver value and positive outcomes for our stakeholders."", ""With that, I'll turn the call to Bill, and he will discuss in more detail the quarter's results and 2024 guidance."", 'Bill Rutherford: Okay, great. Thank you, Sam, and good morning, everyone. I will provide some additional comments on our performance for the quarter and year and then discuss our 2024 guidance. We highlighted at our recent Investor Day that our formula of combining strong operational performance with a disciplined and balanced allocation of capital has a long track record of generating value over time. Our results for 2023 and our guidance for 2024 reflect a continuation of this formula. Sam provided many of our fourth quarter indicators in his comments. So let me take a moment to review some of our results for the full year 2023. We have strong top line growth. For the year, our same facility admissions grew 3.3% over prior year, equivalent admissions grew 4.8%, emergency room business grew 4.7% and total surgical cases were up 2.3%.', 'We maintained our strong acuity trends with case mix index increasing and payer mix improved with managed care and other admissions growing 6% for the full year on a same-facility basis. Revenue per equivalent admission grew 2.7% on a same facility basis. This contributed to same-facility revenue growing 7.6% and 7.9% on a consolidated basis for the full year 2023. We coupled top line strength with strong management of operating costs. Salaries, wages and benefits as a percentage of revenue improved 60 basis points on a consolidated basis compared to prior year. Contract labor declined 20% for the year and equated to 5.3% of those SMEB in the fourth quarter. Our teams continue to do a great job managing the supply costs, which improved 40 basis points as a percentage of revenue for the full year.', 'As we have mentioned throughout the year, we are managing through pressures on professional fees and hospital-based physician costs. But we saw an improvement in the sequential rate of growth in both the third and fourth quarter. Sam mentioned, we also saw an improvement in our Valesco joint venture, which was in line with our expectations. We are confident in our plans to continue working through what we believe are industry-wide pressures in this area. The result of this is we produced solid margins of 19.6% in line with our range of expectations on a consolidated basis and adjusted EBITDA growth of 5.5% on an as reported basis for the full year 2023. So as a management team, we are very pleased with the operational performance of the company during the year.', 'Let me briefly discuss our results in the fourth quarter. Adjusted EBITDA grew just under 14% in the quarter as compared to the prior year. This is primarily due to strong revenue growth and solid expense management during the quarter. In addition to our strong core business trends, we recognized a year-over-year adjusted EBITDA increase of approximately $250 million related to our supplemental payment programs. This includes the new North Carolina program and certain favorable adjustments within the Texas program. Additionally, based on our experience with the program to date, we began accruing the Florida program in the quarter, whereas previously, we had recognized this program on an annual lump sum basis. Our recently acquired entities, as well as facilities divested in the prior year, resulted in about $90 million less adjusted EBITDA in the quarter, with roughly half of this decline from the Valesco joint venture.', 'In summary, the quarter was the strongest operational performance of the year. And with the additional benefit from the supplemental programs and impact of new and divested facilities, we are very pleased with the year-over-year growth we were able to produce. So next let me speak to capital allocation. We deployed a balanced allocation of capital in 2023. For the full year, our cash flow from operations was $9.4 billion compared to $8.5 billion in the prior year or just under 11% growth. Capital expenditures were just above $4.7 billion for the year, which was in line with our expectations. We purchased approximately $3.8 billion of our outstanding shares and paid approximately $660 million of dividends during the year. Our debt-to-adjusted EBITDA leverage remains near the low end of our stated guidance range of three to four times, so we believe we are well positioned going into 2024.', 'And with that, let me speak to our 2024 guidance for a moment. As noted in our release this morning, we are providing full year 2024 guidance as follows. We expect revenues to range between $67.75 billion and $70.25 billion. We expect net income attributable to HCA Healthcare to range between $5.2 billion and $5.6 billion. We expect adjusted EBITDA to range between $12.85 billion and $13.55 billion. And expect diluted earnings per share to range between $19.70 and $21.20. And finally, we expect capital spending to range between $5.1 billion and $5.3 billion. So let me provide a little additional commentary on our guidance. First, let me note the $145 million payer settlement we reported in the first quarter of 2023. Our guidance assumes a growth in equivalent admissions between 3% and 4% and revenue per equivalent admission between 2% and 3%.', 'Regarding state supplemental programs, I want to highlight that these programs are complex and most have multiple attributes that impact the timing and amounts we receive. So this results in some variability of the timing of recognizing the impact of these programs during the year. For 2024, we are anticipating benefit from a new program in Nevada. But based on current assumptions, we expect some modest headwinds when we aggregate the impact of all of these supplemental programs and we believe this could range between $100 million and $200 million for the year. We expect full year margins to be within our historical trends, and cash flow from operations to range between $9.5 billion and $10 billion. Depreciation is estimated to be about $3.2 billion.', 'And interest expense is projected to be around $2 billion. Finally, our fully diluted shares are expected to be around 264 million for the year. Also noted in our release this morning, our Board of Directors has authorized a new $6 billion share repurchase program. This will be in addition to the approximately $300 million remaining on our prior authorization. In addition, our Board declared an increase in our quarterly dividend from $0.60 to $0.66 per share. With that, let me turn the call back over to Sam.', ""Sam Hazen: All right, thank you, Bill. As you saw in our press release, Bill Rutherford has decided to retire after 34 years with the company, 10 years as CFO, and Bill had a tremendous career with HCA. And then in my communication to our colleagues throughout the company I indicated that is impressive as the results were financially with the company during his tenure. Bill's legacy with the company will be remembered by the many people in the company has positively impacted with his leadership, mentorship and the way he embraced our mission and culture. And so Bill, congratulations on your retirement, and thank you very much on behalf of the Board and the senior team for everything you've done for the organization. Now part of Bill’s legacy is creating a really deep financial team inside our organization."", ""We pride ourselves on having the capabilities to build talent and then replace talent and we are fortunate to have Mike Marks as our next CFO. Mike has been with the company for 28 years. He has had various roles most of which were in the National Group as the Group’s CFO for the National Group for 10 years, and then he has been in the Senior Vice President and Financial Operations role for the last few years. He is a proven HCA executive, he understands and appreciates our culture, he knows how to execute and get results and I know he's going to be an exceptional CFO for HCA. And I am eager for many of you to get to meet him. So Mike, congratulations. So with that Frank, we will go into questions."", 'Frank Morgan: Thank you, Sam. And thank you, Bill. As a reminder, please limit yourself to one question so we might give as many as possible in the queue, an opportunity to ask a question. Greg, you may now give instructions to those who would like to ask a question.', 'See also 15 Countries that Produce the Best Software Engineers and 35 Low-Stress High-Paying Jobs In The World.', 'To continue reading the Q&A session, please click here.']"

Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.', 'Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).', 'How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Take-Two?', ""For Take-Two, the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of -8.01%."", 'On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #1.', 'So, this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Take-Two will beat the consensus EPS estimate.', 'Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?', ""While calculating estimates for a company's future earnings, analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number."", 'For the last reported quarter, it was expected that Take-Two would post earnings of $1.02 per share when it actually produced earnings of $1.23, delivering a surprise of +20.59%.', 'Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates three times.', 'Bottom Line', 'An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.', ""That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported."", ""Take-Two doesn't appear a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release."", 'Expected Results of an Industry Player', 'Another stock from the Zacks Toys - Games - Hobbies industry, Mattel (MAT), is soon expected to post earnings of $0.32 per share for the quarter ended December 2023. This estimate indicates a year-over-year change of +77.8%. Revenues for the quarter are expected to be $1.68 billion, up 19.8% from the year-ago quarter.', 'The consensus EPS estimate for Mattel has been revised 36.2% lower over the last 30 days to the current level. However, a lower Most Accurate Estimate has resulted in an Earnings ESP of -27.56%.', 'This Earnings ESP, combined with its Zacks Rank #4 (Sell), makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Mattel will beat the consensus EPS estimate.

With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Kevin Clark."", ""Kevin Clark: Thank you, Jane, and thanks everyone for joining us this morning. Let's begin on Slide 3. Aptiv ended the year on a solid note with fourth quarter results broadly in-line with our expectations, demonstrating our ability to execute in a less predictable market. Touching on a few highlights, new business bookings reached $7.7 billion, the result of continued demand for our portfolio of industry-leading advanced technologies; revenue was $4.9 billion, with growth over market impacted by the UAW strike and customer mix, which Joe will go through in more detail later; operating income totaled $600 million, reflecting a 90 basis point margin increase; the strong flow-through on volumes and operating performance more than offset headwinds from FX, commodities, and the UAW strike; we repurchased $300 million of stock during the quarter, given our share price and cash position."", 'In summary, our team is doing an exceptional job executing in a fast-changing environment, identifying opportunities to provide solutions to our customers, while at the same time, working to mitigate headwinds from ongoing cost pressures. Turning to Slide 4, we delivered on our commitments and achieved record results in 2023, despite having to navigate through unexpected developments. New business bookings were a record $34 billion, reflecting continued strong demand for our products. As vehicles become higher contented and more software defined, customers are increasingly seeing the value of Aptiv as an important technology partner, particularly across our smart vehicle architecture, active safety and high voltage electrification portfolio, where we lead the industry in delivering high-performance, flexible and cost-effective solutions.', 'Aptiv is also positioned to benefit from the transition to the software-defined future across several other industries, with opportunities accelerating in the telecom, aerospace and defense, and industrial markets. Revenue increased 12% to over $20 billion in 2023, a new record level, principally driven by our high-growth active safety and high voltage product lines. Strong top-line growth contributed to a record $2.1 billion of operating income, operating margin increased 150 basis points to 10.6% as strong volume flow-through and operating performance more than offset the headwinds from FX, commodities and the UAW strike. Lastly, we generated record operating cash flow of $1.9 billion for the year, providing flexibility around capital deployment, allowing us to proactively repurchase shares and pay down debt.', 'Moving to Slide 5, as I already mentioned, bookings reached $34 billion, our third consecutive year of record new business awards, and includes nine different customers, who each awarded Aptiv over $1 billion in new business. Advanced Safety and User Experience bookings totaled a record $12 billion, driven by active safety bookings of $3.4 billion, representing a combination of next-gen hardware and perception software building blocks, as well as full system turnkey solutions. The strength of which is reflected in over $11 billion of cumulative bookings over the last three years, and $5.2 billion of customer awards for our smart vehicle architecture solutions with three different OEMs, bringing cumulative awards since the launch of our SVA products to over $10 billion with eight different OEMs. Signal and Power Solutions new business bookings reached a record of over $22 billion, in part due to a record $6.2 billion in high voltage electrification bookings, up roughly $2 billion over 2022, representing awards from both traditional and new mobility providers, bringing cumulative high voltage customer awards to roughly $14 billion since 2021.', ""Our industry-leading portfolio, combined with our global reach and ability to execute highly complex programs, perfectly positions Aptiv to win new business and gives us a clear line of sight to $35 billion of business awards in 2024. Turning to Slide 6 to review our Advanced Safety and User Experience segment's full year highlights. We achieved significant commercial success across all of our key product lines, further solidifying our position as a partner of choice with our OEM customers. Building on its leading market position, Wind River continues to experience solid commercial traction across a variety of end markets. In the fourth quarter, one of Canada's largest communication service providers selected Wind River Studio for their full O-RAN deployment in North America."", ""OMRON, a leader in healthcare systems and industrial automation, also chose Wind River Studio for their industrial edge platform development. And within automotive, Hyundai Mobis expanded their existing relationship with Wind River by selecting Wind River Studio to help reduce development time and costs from product design to system validation and mass production testing. Demand for Aptiv's full system solutions across active safety, user experience and smart vehicle architecture also remains strong, with major bookings across all geographic regions, including with Japanese OEMs and emerging Chinese local players, bringing a growing pipeline of additional opportunities. To best support our customers, while further optimizing our cost structure, we implemented several initiatives across our engineering and supply chain functions."", ""To accelerate and streamline our product development process, our AS&UX engineers have incorporated Wind River Studio's DevSecOps toolchain into their programs. We've also centralized our engineering activities in India to a new and larger technology center in Bangalore, where Aptiv and Wind River teams can better collaborate on our software product platforms, allowing us to double our engineering capacity in the country, thereby enabling the cost effective rotation of our engineering footprint. From a supply chain perspective, we're on track to fully map our global supply chain into a digital twin by year-end. During 2023, we fully mapped our semi providers, increasing our visibility and improving our ability to proactively mitigate potential sourcing risks."", ""Lastly, we've closely partnered with roughly a dozen local Chinese semiconductor suppliers for both China and non-China applications that are positioning us to meet increasing demand from our Chinese customers with local sources of supply and increasing the resiliency and flexibility of our supply chain for our global OEM customers. Turning to Signal and Power Solutions' full year highlights on Slide 7. From a commercial perspective, we've continued to benefit from our industry-leading portfolio and global scale, which uniquely positions us to deliver optimized vehicle architecture solutions for both emerging EV players and leading global OEMs. During 2023, we were awarded significant vehicle architecture programs by a global EV manufacturer, including optimized electrical distribution and 48 volt connection systems."", ""In China, while we remain highly selective in our customer and platform choices, we're actively driving increased penetration of a select group of local OEMs. In 2023, bookings with China local OEMs reached $3 billion, representing approximately 60% of the total SPS bookings in the region. Intercable Automotive had record new business awards and added four new global customers with their industry-leading busbar technology, which enables more efficient power distribution and optimized battery pack design. We've also seen an increase in customer demand for our solutions that reduce complexity, weight and cost, including our integrated power electronics solutions, which help integrate the onboard charger, battery distribution unit and DC to DC converter."", ""From an operational perspective, we've also implemented several initiatives to improve manufacturing efficiency. Within our electrical distribution business, we're launching our first highly automated production line, covering all aspects of system assembly. With this new technology, we expect to increase current automation levels to approximately 30% by 2026, putting us on a path to over 50% automation by 2030, which will improve efficiency and product quality, while also reducing labor dependency and the associated exposure to inflationary pressures. At the same time, we've been building a more resilient and sustainable business by supporting the trend towards local production and minimizing cross-border flows of product. We continue to pursue manufacturing footprint rotations in multiple regions and have successfully established production capabilities for Intercable Automotive in North America to serve in-region customers."", ""Turning to Slide 8, at this year's Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas, we showcased our industry-leading portfolio of products through a full range of functional, fully integrated solutions, both in our tech theater, as well as on the roads with drivable demo vehicles. This is best represented by our software defined vehicle demonstrator, which showcased advanced ADAS and user experience applications, embedded on Wind River's cloud native software platform and running on Aptiv smart vehicle architecture hardware. With our first time driving a vehicle -- this was our first time driving a vehicle on public roads, supported by SVA, further reinforcing our leadership in next-generation architectures. We demonstrated critical elements of our Gen 6 ADAS platform, including our urban point-to-point hands-free driving application, as well as in-cabin monitoring."", ""We also showcased our high voltage capabilities with a custom-built 800-volt electric vehicle. This vehicle included optimized high voltage cabling and busbars, connection systems, and integrated power electronics. We also introduced Aptiv's containerized battery management system running on our central vehicle controller, both of which were supported by Wind River's VxWorks operating system, while telemetric data was visualized through Wind River Studio. Finally, all these solutions and more were available for deep dives in our technology theater. When taken together, the solutions on display represented our full system portfolio by showcasing capabilities from sensor to cloud. In total, we had over 1,000 stakeholders visit our pavilion, ranging across customers, vendors and the industry partners."", ""And as a follow up to CES, we scheduled a wide range of customer engagements, including the Mobile World Congress in late February and customer-focused tech shows during the balance of this year. Our industry-leading product portfolio underscores our position as the partner of choice to develop and deliver next-generation solutions. Moving to Slide 9, before I turn the call over to Joe to walk through the financials, I wanted to provide some context on our outlook for 2024. As our industries continue to evolve, we're experiencing growing demand for our full system capabilities, spanning across hardware and edge to cloud software solutions. This increasing level of strategic engagement has turned into three straight years of record new business bookings, and in turn, will continue to drive strong revenue growth and implied growth above market."", ""Joe will walk through our outlook for revenue growth in more detail, but we now expect our growth over market to be in the 6 point to 8 point range, reflecting the changing pace of EV adoption and customer mix. As I highlighted earlier, we have proactively taken actions to reduce our cost structure, to adapt to the changing market environment and to help offset ongoing inflationary pressures. We remain disciplined in our capital allocation approach, which will include further strengthening our competitive position with investments in advanced technology and capabilities that drive operational excellence. To that end, while our Motional joint venture continues to make progress on their technology roadmap, we've decided to no longer allocate capital to Motional and are pursuing alternatives to further reduce our ownership interest."", ""Lastly, while we will continue to prioritize organic investments and strategic M&A opportunities that drive profitable growth, our stock price presents an attractive opportunity to return capital to our shareholders, and we're targeting up to an additional $750 million in share repurchases during 2024. The last few years have presented the industry with unprecedented macro challenges, including COVID and supply chain disruptions. During this period, the management team has remained laser-focused on execution, enhancing our competitive position and increasing the resiliency of our business model, which is reflected in our 2023 financial results and our outlook for 2024, and our conviction in the long-term value of our business is higher than ever, and we remain committed to delivering that value to our shareholders."", 'With that, I will now turn the call over to Joe to go through the numbers in more detail.', 'Joe Massaro: Thanks, Kevin, and good morning, everyone. Starting with a recap of the quarter on Slide 10. Revenues were $4.9 billion, in-line with our expectations, including the impact of the UAW strike in October. Adjusted growth in the quarter was 2% over the prior year, representing negative growth over market of 5% in the quarter. As Kevin noted, and I will discuss in more detail, the growth over market primarily resulted from the impact of the UAW strike and North American OEM production mix, as well as customer mix in China and slower high voltage growth. Adjusted EBITDA and operating income of $772 million and $600 million, respectively, in-line with our expectations. Operating income margins expanded 90 basis points versus prior year, reflecting strong flow-through on incremental volumes, the benefit of customer recoveries of direct material increases and strong operating performance, including the benefit of cost saving actions taken in the second half of 2023, offsetting the impact of the strike, which totaled approximately $50 million in the quarter, and foreign exchange was a 20-basis point headwind in the quarter.', 'EPS was $1.40, an increase of 10%, driven by higher operating income, partially offset by interest and tax expense. Operating cash flow totaled $624 million, and capital expenditures were approximately $200 million for the quarter. During the fourth quarter, we repurchased $300 million of stock, bringing full year repurchases to approximately $400 million. Looking at revenue in more detail on Slide 11. As noted, revenue in the fourth quarter was $4.9 billion, reflecting sales growth of $188 million, a favorable $62 million contribution from net price downs and commodities and foreign exchange tailwinds of approximately $29 million. From a regional perspective, North American revenues were down 7% or 11% below market, driven in part by the UAW strike impact, which totaled $100 million in October.', 'In addition, as we cautioned during the fourth quarter, foreign manufacturers, primarily the Japanese OEMs with whom we do not have significant content, experienced very strong year-over-year production growth in the quarter, further impacting the relative production mix in the North American market. In Europe, adjusted growth was 6%, in-line with vehicle production, driven by active safety growth of 18%, partially offset by slower high voltage growth in the region. And in China, revenues were up 12%, driven by SPS growth with local OEMs. China growth over market was 8 points below vehicle production, primarily impacted by lower production at multinational joint venture customers, as well as slower high voltage growth of 4% in the quarter. As I will discuss in more detail shortly, we do expect growth over market to increase in 2024 from the second half 2023 levels.', 'Moving to the AS&UX segment on the next slide. Revenue growth was flat in the quarter. Active safety growth was 11% despite the UAW strike, which primarily impacted the active safety product line in North America. User experience was down 16% in the quarter, driven in large part by the previously noted China customer mix shift, impacting our user experience volumes with multinational joint venture OEMs in China. For the full year, adjusted revenue growth was 17% with strong active safety growth of 29% and user experience growth of 4%. Segment adjusted operating in the quarter was $141 million, up 83% over prior year, despite the negative strike impact of $10 million in the quarter. Operating income margins expanded 440 basis points to 10.4% as performance and cost savings initiatives offset higher labor costs.', 'Full year operating income and margins were in-line with our original expectations, as margins improved by almost 40 basis points, inclusive of a full year strike impact of $15 million. As we have previously discussed, given the nature of the AS&UX business and the timing of certain customer reimbursements and engineering credits, the quarterly profitability of the business is cyclical and weighted to the fourth quarter. We would expect this trend to continue in 2024. Turning to Signal and Power on Slide 13, revenue in the fourth quarter was $3.6 billion, an increase of 3% or 4% below vehicle production. As anticipated, overall SPS growth over market was impacted in North America by the UAW strike and OEM mix, representing approximately 5 points of growth in the quarter.', 'Lower high voltage growth, which primarily impacted the European region, was lower by 2 points. For the full year, adjusted revenue growth was 11% despite the impact of the strike. High voltage growth was approximately 20% for the year and segment growth in China was 13%. Segment adjusted operating income was $459 million in the quarter, up 3% from prior year, despite a $40 million or 90 basis point strike impact. Operating performance was strong, including the benefit of lower supply chain disruption costs, offsetting the impact of higher labor and other costs. Customer recoveries offset the impact of material inflation and commodities in the quarter, and foreign exchange continued to present a headwind, equal to 60 basis points on a year-over-year basis.', 'Full year operating margins were up 50 basis points despite the significant headwinds related to foreign exchange and the strike. Turning now to Slide 14 and 2024 macro expectations. We are forecasting global vehicle production to be flat for the year, reflecting approximately 93 million units. Regionally, we expect North America to be up approximately 1% at 16.5 million units, Europe down 2% or approximately 18 million units, and China flat at approximately 30 million units. While we remain cautious about the impact of macroeconomic and geopolitical factors, we do believe that supply chain constraints have improved significantly, and based on what we see today, should not have a significant impact on overall customer production levels. Our macro assumptions also assume copper at $4, Mexican Peso at 18.25, the Euro at 110 and the RMB at 7.', 'Moving to Slide 15 and our 2024 full year outlook. We expect revenue in the range of $21.3 billion to $21.9 billion, up 7% at the midpoint compared to 2023, reflecting 7 points of growth over market. EBITDA and operating income are expected to be approximately $3.28 billion and $2.55 billion at the midpoint, reflecting strong flow-through on volume growth, continued margin expansion in higher growth product lines, and operating performance and cost reduction initiatives to offset increasing labor headwinds, including higher-than-expected labor inflation in Mexico, as well as the stronger Peso. Adjusted earnings per share is estimated to be between $5.55 and $6.05. EPS growth of 19% is primarily driven by strong earnings and lower interest expense, partially offset by an increase in the expected tax rate to 17.5%.', ""As I will discuss further, we are targeting share repurchases of $750 million in 2024 and have reflected a full year benefit estimate of $0.05 per share at the midpoint of our guidance. As it relates to Motional, as Kevin mentioned earlier, Aptiv will not participate in future funding rounds. Despite the continued progress made by the Motional team on their technology roadmap, given the pushout of the commercialization of the Level 4/5 robo-taxi business model, we no longer believe capital allocation to Motional is appropriate for Aptiv. In addition, we are also exploring steps to reduce a significant portion of our common equity holdings. Working within the construct of the joint venture agreement, we will look to sell or otherwise reduce our holdings during 2024, reducing the dilutive earnings per share impact of the Motional losses on Aptiv's earnings."", ""Given that the exact timing of the reduction in shareholdings is not yet known, we have included the expected full year impact of Motional's losses in our current outlook: a non-cash equity loss of approximately $340 million or $1.20 of earnings per share. Moving to cash flow, we expect 2024 operating cash flow of $2.3 billion, driven by higher earnings. Capital expenditures are expected to be approximately 5% of revenues. Finally, although we are not providing quarterly guidance in 2024, we did want to provide some perspective on calendarization during the year as both revenue growth and earnings are weighted towards the second half. Our full year guidance assumes adjusted revenue growth in the first half of the year of 3% to 5%. Adjusted growth in the second half of the year accelerates to 9% to 10%, and is weighted towards the fourth quarter."", ""With respect to earnings, consistent with the higher level of revenue growth and the previously noted cyclicality in the business, margins will expand throughout the year similar to 2023. On Slide 16, we provide a bridge of 2024 revenue and operating income guidance as compared to 2023. Starting with revenue, our growth over market combined with flat global vehicle production results in a net contribution of revenues of $1.2 billion. The full year benefit of material cost recoveries will effectively offset changes in commodity, prices and price downs, and FX is estimated at a positive $100 million. Turning to adjusted operating income, we expect margin expansion of 120 basis points in the midpoint of our guide, driven by continued strong flow-through on incremental volumes, net price and commodities will offset, and we expect our strong operating performance in 2023 to continue into '24, as manufacturing and material performance as well as additional cost reduction actions are expected to offset incremental labor costs and non-material inflation."", ""In summary, we remain focused on driving disciplined revenue growth while balancing investment in the business with increased levels of performance and expanding operating margins. Moving to Slide 17, we wanted to discuss our updated growth over market framework of 6% to 8%, down from our prior range of 8% to 10%. As we have discussed, our growth over market represents Aptiv's relative secular growth expectations above global vehicle production. During the second half of 2023, our growth over market was negatively impacted by several factors, including the UAW strike, stronger Japanese OEM production in North America, as well as a change in Chinese customer mix as local Chinese OEMs grew faster than multinational customers in China. When combined with a direct UAW strike impact, the OEM and customer mix reduced our growth over market in 2023 by approximately 5 points on a full year basis."", 'In addition, a slowdown in high voltage growth, driven by lower EV production, and the exiting of a relationship with a smaller North American EV only producer accounted for a 2% decrease in growth over market. As we look out into 2024, we believe the impact of the UAW strike and the OEM production mix in North America effectively reverses. In addition, improved production schedules at our multinational Chinese OEM customers and our continued growth with local Chinese OEMs will contribute to higher growth over market in China. However, we are forecasting high voltage growth to slow to approximately 20% in 2024, consistent with the 2023 levels, but down from pre-2023 levels of approximately 30%. Our updated framework of 6% to 8% incorporates these changes as well as the continued contribution from our active safety, engineered components and commercial vehicle product lines.', 'Slide 18 provides an update on our multi-year margin expansion performance. As noted, we saw very strong margin expansion in 2023, exceeding the expectations we laid out last February. Operating income margin expanded 150 basis points over 2022, despite the strike impact of $80 million and foreign exchange headwinds of over $100 million. Strong flow-through on sales growth was partially offset by net price in commodities as a slight headwind, and we saw significant reductions in supply chain disruption costs, and the operating teams drove incremental material and manufacturing performance, more than offsetting the impact of higher labor and operating costs. The accomplishments of last year provide a strong jumping-off point for 2024, as we target 120 basis point margin expansion at the midpoint of our guide.', ""In addition to the ongoing performance initiatives during the second half of 2023, we also took several cost reduction actions to help bolster our overall performance and help ensure achievement of the 2024 margin expansion. These additional actions, as well as our continued focus on our overall cost structure and footprint, are necessary as we expect to see continued labor and operating cost pressures, particularly in our Mexico operations over the coming years. We are also forecasting the Peso to remain at a relatively strong level in 2024. Before handing the call back to Kevin, I'd like to touch upon our continued strong performance as it relates to cash flow generation and capital allocation. We generated a record $1.9 billion in operating cash flow, allowing us to continue to maintain a disciplined and accretive track record of capital deployment."", 'In 2023, we continue to invest in the business, focusing on longer-term growth and innovation. In addition, we opportunistically de-levered by paying down our $300 million Term Loan A resulting in a full year earnings per share benefit of $0.05 in 2024. In addition, we purchased $400 million of stock, including $300 million in the fourth quarter. Looking at 2024, we expect operating cash flow to increase to $2.3 billion, and we will continue to maintain a well-balanced approach to capital allocation. In addition to both investing in organic and inorganic opportunities, we are forecasting additional share repurchases in 2024, targeting a total of $750 million in the year, while we will continue to maintain our current financial policy, as it relates to our balance sheet and leverage profile.', ""As we have discussed in the past, our sustainable business model and relentless focus on operating performance enables us to convert more income to cash, allowing Aptiv to maintain a well-balanced approach to capital allocation that, we believe, helps drive shareholder value. And with that, I'd like to hand the call back to Kevin for his closing remarks."", ""Kevin Clark: Thanks, Joe. I'll wrap up on Slide 20 before opening the line up for questions. As the management team reflects on 2023, we expect the pace of innovation to continue to accelerate and drive ongoing transformation across industries. Aptiv is perfectly positioned to benefit from this change, having identified the safe, green and connected megatrends over a decade ago. We have purpose built our portfolio to provide flexible, high-performance and cost-effective solutions that address our customers greatest challenges, all on a global scale. At the same time, we remain committed to flawless execution and operational excellence, enabling us to unlock incremental profitability and deliver value to our shareholders. In closing, I am proud of what the Aptiv team accomplished during 2023, and I'm excited about what we will deliver in the years ahead. Operator, let's now open the line for questions."", 'See also 15 Best Low Cost Stocks To Buy Under $75 and 12 Highest Quality Camera Phones in 2024.', 'To continue reading the Q&A session, please click here.']"

My name is Cynthia, and I am your operator for today's call. Today's conference is being recorded. (Operator Instructions) I would now like to introduce Ryan Simon, Vice President, Investor Relations, to begin the call. Please go ahead."", 'Ryan M. Simon', ""Thank you, Cynthia. Good afternoon, and thank you for joining Hologic's First Quarter Fiscal 2024 Earnings Call. With me today are Steve MacMillan, the company's Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer; Karleen Oberton, our Chief Financial Officer; and Essex Mitchell, our Chief Operating Officer. Our first quarter press release is available now on the Investors section of our website. We will also post our prepared remarks to our website shortly after we deliver them as well as an updated corporate presentation. And a replay of this call will be available on our website for the next 30 days. Before we begin, we would like to inform you that certain statements we make today will be forward-looking. These statements involve known and unknown risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied. Such factors include those referenced in the safe harbor statement included in our earnings release and SEC filings. Also during this call, we will discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation to GAAP can be found in our earnings release. Two of these non-GAAP measures are: one, organic revenue, which we define as revenue, excluding divested businesses, and revenue from acquired businesses owned by Hologic for less than 1 year; and two, organic revenue, excluding COVID-19, which further excludes COVID-19 assay revenue, revenue related to COVID-19 and sales from discontinued products in diagnostics. Finally, any percentage changes we discuss will be on a year-over-year basis, and revenue growth rates will be in constant currency unless otherwise noted. Now I'd like to turn the call over to Steve MacMillan, Hologic's CEO."", 'Stephen P. MacMillan', ""Thank you, Ryan, and good afternoon, everyone. We are pleased to discuss our financial results for the first quarter of fiscal 2024. For the quarter, total revenue was $1.01 billion and non-GAAP earnings per share was $0.98. Both revenue and EPS came in above the high end of our guidance. Before diving into our results, it is important to view our Q1 growth performance in proper perspective. Simply put, our first 2 quarters of fiscal '24 faced incredibly difficult comps. Despite Q1 '24, having 4 fewer selling days compared to the prior year and even against a prior year Molecular Diagnostics ex COVID revenue growth of 24.5% and a surgical revenue growth rate of nearly 15%, we grew total organic revenue ex COVID, a solid 5.2%. Even more impressive, when adjusting for the 4 fewer selling days, our Q1 results stand taller. On an adjusted basis, we estimate the total company organic revenue growth ex COVID, was in the high single digits for the period. These are incredibly strong results against challenging comps as we continue to perform exceptionally well against our 5% to 7% ex COVID long-term target. We continue to showcase our durability and broad strength across our divisions, both delivering on our short-term guidance and maintaining our long-term targets. Keep in mind that our long-term revenue targets are more impressive today given we are growing off a much larger base than we originally contemplated. As we've said before, you can count on us to deliver. During our call today, we will focus on building upon our messaging from the JPMorgan conference 3 weeks ago. During our presentation, we highlighted that we are a new Hologic, bigger, faster, stronger and poised for continued success. As part of our discussion, Essex will share more insights about our high confidence in our future success. He will also shed light on what we view as underappreciated elements of our growth strategy, that are helpful to fully recognize the potential of our business. Before then turning the call over to Karleen to discuss our detailed financial results, we will share reflections from our participation at the World Economic Forum in Davos. While we continue to make progress elevating women's health, it is clear we still have a long way to go. Starting with our meetings at JPMorgan. We realize there are 2 camps of investors. There is one camp that understands our transformation and recognizes the drivers powering our current results and future growth potential. At the same time, there is another camp that quite frankly, does not. That said, we certainly appreciate the complexity. Over the past 3 years, there have been many moving pieces, clouding the narrative of the force we've become, from revenues still normalizing following the ups and downs of COVID to moving past semiconductor chip supply challenges, to selling days dynamics only naming a few. Each has contributed to irregular comps that may be difficult to interpret and also challenging to model. We appreciate that each represents a layer of complexity that must be pulled back to fully appreciate the underlying strength of our business. Looking beyond the quarterly nuances, our steady performance over time really shines. Above all, we are bigger, faster, stronger and poised for further growth. We are a durable and diversified growth company with disciplined operations, peer group-leading margins, an exceptionally strong balance sheet and above all, a talented and engaged employee workforce. We are poised to continue to drive top line growth while growing the bottom line even faster. To shed more light on what gives us high confidence in our future, I'll pass it over to Essex."", 'Essex D. Mitchell', ""Thank you, Steve, and good afternoon, everyone. As we commented over the past several quarters, we have dramatically transformed our business since 2019 through the challenges of the pandemic. More recently, as we've moved further away from the peaks of COVID testing and prevalence, we have posted exceptional ex-COVID results. These results back up our claims then we are much more than a COVID story and without a doubt, built for the long term. At the same time, as Steve mentioned, there is a lot to unpack to fully understand our business. Many recognize that we are a new Hologic compared to where we were in fiscal 2019. Since then, we've grown our Molecular Diagnostics business approximately 80%, our Breast business nearly 10% and our Surgical business, nearly 40%. Yet there are still some on the fence and uncertain of our future growth potential. As some of our peers have also performed well over this time period, it's not easy to see the true wins. The underlying assumption is that winners must be exclusively taking share. In reality, there was much more to it. In addition to competing and taking share, Hologic's growth is centered on innovation and making share. We then drive this innovation to commercial execution by leveraging our world-class sales teams. As we are positioned today, our future growth is much less about hand-to-hand combat in the trenches of the markets where we operate. Instead, our growth is derived from growing and expanding markets through education, awareness, innovative new products and tapping into underpenetrated markets. As an example, our 3 largest revenue product lines launched since 2019 excluding COVID, our BV/CV/TV, Biotheranostics and Fluent. These 3 lines alone collectively delivered over $300 million in revenue in 2023. That was essentially nonexistent to start 2019. Moreover, each product line falls into one or more of our market-creating strategies, and each is still in their earlier stages of growth. Similarly, outside of the top 3, we have a number of other product lines in new since 2019, which could each individually represent $100 million revenue opportunity over time. And these lines are also still in their earlier innings of growth. To highlight a few, our respiratory assays, GYN scopes and laparoscopic surgical portfolio each delivered double-digit growth rate for fiscal '23. On top of our market expansion activity, we continue to drive further growth by leveraging our large installed and user bases of core products in each division. Through the Panther, our gantry and our hysteroscopic surgical portfolio, we have incredibly deep customer relationships in each of our unique channels. Post COVID, our call points around the world are stronger than ever. Customers associate Hologic with industry-leading differentiated technologies, ongoing innovation, best-in-class workflow and automation solutions. Moreover, our strong reputation as leaders and champions for women's health continues to open doors. Earning this advantage provides us a unique opportunity to supercharge growth from products introduced into our channel. While there are many out there that claim to be winners, even in categories, we continue to lead it year-over-year. We are extremely confident in our ability to carve out and create opportunities for growth. Similarly, we are equally confident in our demonstrated ability to gain and maintain market share across our core product lines. With our core businesses incredibly healthy in many of our growth driving products still in early innings. All in, we believe we are well positioned for the future and well positioned to maintain our strong performance for the years to come. Steve?"", 'Stephen P. MacMillan', ""Thank you, Essex. To close out the discussion of our growth prospects, while we continue to make significant progress outside of the U.S. we still have tremendous opportunity to grow and build a much greater presence internationally. Shifting gears, before turning the call over to Karleen, we'd like to share reflections from our time at the World Economic Forum in Davos. For a third year in a row, we had the opportunity to participate at the Forum where we presented the results of our third annual Hologic Global Women's Health Index. The index, which is the largest study of its kind, examining the overall state of women's health and well-being, continues to generate tremendous support from major organizations dedicated to improving women's health. As we've said before, over time, we believe the index may be the single greatest contribution to the world that we make at Hologic. This year's results show that we all need to stand behind women more than ever. The harsh reality is that women's health globally has not only stagnated over the past year, but is sadly moving in the wrong direction. The data shows that only 11% of women were screened for cancer and only 10% for STIs. Billions of women are not being screened, this must change, and we have a tremendous opportunity to lead the way with our women's health portfolio. The key takeaway here is that in many ways, our markets are still in the early innings of reaching their potential. As we look ahead, we are even more inspired to live into our purpose, passion and promise. We continue to believe, and we have proven that we can drive results through our unwavering commitment to women's health. Our strong results come from our strong purpose. And finally, in late breaking news, we are incredibly proud to announce that just last night, our new Genius Digital Diagnostic System with the Genius cervical AI algorithm received clearance from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. This accomplishment is only made possible by the creativity, focus and dedication of our outstanding diagnostics team. Continuing to trail blaze our path, our system is the first and only FDA-cleared digital cytology system that combines deep learning-based AI with advanced imaging technology. It can help more accurately detect cervical cancer, improved cytology workflow and ultimately enhance patient care. We continue to deliver and at a time when women need it most. With that, let me hand the call over to Karleen."", 'Karleen M. Oberton', ""Thank you, Steve, and good afternoon, everyone, and congratulations again to our diagnostics team. In my statements today, I will provide an overview of our divisional revenue results and walk down our income statement that highlights the broad-based strong performance across our business. I will also touch on a few additional key financial metrics and finish with our guidance for the second quarter of fiscal '24 and the full year. Jumping right in, we are pleased to share that our first quarter financial performance was strong. We exceeded our expectations on both the top and bottom line. Total revenue came in at $1.013 billion, beating the midpoint of our guidance by about $40 million. As Steve mentioned, despite 4 fewer selling days in the quarter, we delivered organic revenue growth of 5.2%, excluding the impact of COVID in line with our long-term revenue growth target of 5% to 7%. In addition, non-GAAP earnings per share was $0.98, exceeding the high end of our guidance. Overall, we continue to deliver robust performance on both the top and bottom lines.Before moving to our divisional results, we again want to emphasize that our balance sheet and willingness to deploy capital remain a core strength of our business in a macro environment that remains dynamic. As an example, in our first quarter, we initiated a $500 million accelerated share repurchase program. We purchased an additional $150 million of our stock and also paid down $250 million of floating rate debt. With a cash balance of $1.9 billion, a leverage ratio well below our target range, and roughly $350 million remaining on our current share repurchase authorization, we have significant firepower and flexibility to deploy further capital, should the opportunity arise. Turning to our divisional results. In Diagnostics, first quarter revenue of $447.8 million declined 20.6%. Excluding COVID assay and related ancillary revenue, Diagnostics revenue declined 0.9%. Yet adjusted for selling days, we estimate we grew mid-single digits compared to the prior year. As a reminder, Q1 '23 was a very strong quarter for Diagnostics, posting 15.8% growth ex COVID and Molecular Diagnostics [24.5%] growth ex COVID. And without a doubt, our Q1 '24 results was impacted by 4 fewer selling days compared to the prior year. Within Diagnostics, our Molecular business continues to drive the division's results, delivering growth of 1.9% ex COVID or mid- to high single digits when adjusted for the impact of fewer selling days. We continue to see underlying strength in BV/CV/TV, which grew more than 20% in the quarter and is still in its early innings of adoption by our customers. More than 95% of our BV/CV/TV revenue is derived in the U.S., representing incredible longer-term opportunity internationally. In addition, non-COVID respiratory revenue delivered ahead of our expectations as we experienced stronger-than-anticipated demand for our flu, RSV and 4-Plex assays. Our responding with published CDC data on respiratory virus positivity, sales ramped up in the final weeks of the quarter. Finally, Biotheranostics remains a positive driver of growth for our molecular business and delivered accretive revenue performance in the period. Now moving to Breast Health. Total first quarter revenue of $377.7 million increased 12.2%, showcasing solid double-digit growth. Demand for our gantries remains robust, and our interventional business also delivered a strong quarter. In our gantry business, we continue to benefit from a strong cadence of orders in our elevated backlog continues to give us high confidence in the performance of this business going forward. Finally, as a reminder, Q1 '23 results were impacted by constrained supply. In Interventional, we continue to see strong performance from our Brevera needles as well as from our Tumark markers used for marking biopsy sites in suspicious lesions in breast tissue. Leveraging strong performance in the quarter, we believe our Breast Health franchise remains well positioned to deliver on its financial targets in fiscal '24. Continuing next to Surgical. Our first quarter revenue of $162.2 million increased 4.6% or high single digits when adjusted for selling days. The division's growth continues to be fueled by MyoSure in the related Fluent system with an increasing contribution from our laparoscopic portfolio. As anticipated, NovaSure declined in Q1 as we lapped the selling price contribution from the product's V5 extension introduced just before fiscal '23. And finally, in our Skeletal business, first quarter revenue of $25.4 million declined 5.6% from lower capital placement and upgrades. Now let's move on to the rest of the non-GAAP P&L for the first quarter. Gross margin of 60.8% was driven primarily by strong performance in our base business and higher-than-expected COVID revenues, which carries a favorable impact to our margins. However, as anticipated, our gross margin results remains temporarily depressed due to the ongoing amortization of semiconductor chips purchased at higher costs during the chip supply headwind. As we continue to deploy gantries, we are moving farther away from this high-priced inventory. And as a result, we expect margins to continue to benefit from this inventory cycling as we progress through the year. Shifting to operating expenses. Total operating expenses of $327.3 million in the first quarter decreased by 3.6%. This decrease in the period was driven by lower marketing spend, lower costs from fewer days and less expense due to the recently divested SSI business. For Q1 '23, this translates to a 28.5% operating margin, in line with our expectations. While we continue to deliver peer group-leading operating margins, we continue to exercise operational discipline and continuously seek to improve where it makes sense for our business. Below operating income, other income net, represented a gain in our fiscal first quarter. As expected, we benefited from elevated cash balance and high interest rates, even though we deployed significant cash in the quarter. Finally, our tax rate in Q1 was 19.75% as expected. Moving on from the P&L. Cash flow from operations was $220 million in the first quarter. In addition, as previously mentioned, during Q1, we repurchased 2.2 million shares for $150 million. This activity was above and beyond initiating a $500 million ASR, showcasing our high confidence in our business and willingness to bet on ourselves as well as our ongoing strategy to deploy capital. Now let's move on to our non-GAAP financial guidance for the second quarter and full year fiscal '24. For our fiscal Q2 '24, we are expecting total revenue in the range of $990 million to $1.01 billion and EPS of $0.95 to $1. For the full year '24, our guidance assumes revenue of $3.99 billion to $4.065 billion and EPS of $3.97 to $4.12. With respect to foreign exchange, we are assuming an FX tailwind of $2 million for Q2 and $12 million for fiscal '24. We Much of this tailwind was realized in Q1. And therefore, we estimate that foreign exchange will remain neutral to marginally favorable throughout the remainder of the year. Turning to our divisions. We want to reiterate that we expect each business to grow at least 5% to 7% for the full fiscal '24, excluding the impact of COVID. Starting with Diagnostics. We expect the business to grow within our 5% to 7% long-term framework for the remainder of fiscal '24. While performance was below this level in Q1, primarily due to the impact of fewer selling days compared to the prior year period. We expect the division to return to more normal growth in Q2 and for the remainder of our fiscal year. We expect improving utilization and menu expansion on the Panther coupled with ongoing contributions from Biotheranostics to continue to drive molecular growth. Closing out on non-COVID diagnostics, we expect blood revenue of approximately $7 million in Q2 and $30 million for the year. In terms of COVID revenue, we expect COVID assay sales to be approximately $20 million in the second quarter of '24 and $60 million for the full year. COVID related items are expected to be slightly less than $30 million in the second quarter and approximately $105 million for the full year fiscal '24. Moving to Breast Health. We continue to expect fiscal '24 to showcase strong demand for our portfolio of products and services. While moving on, it's important to understand the comp dynamics that will impact the Breast business through fiscal '24. As previously noted, Q1 '23 was a softer comp due to shipped supply constraints. As a reminder, in Q2 '23, we delivered a strong quarter of gantry placements to meet pent-up customer demand during these earlier days of chip supply recovery. And deliveries in Q3 and Q4 of '23 were both lower than Q2. We expect this dynamic to result in a lower breast health year-over-year growth rate in Q2 that will improve in the back half of fiscal '24. For the full year, we continue to expect to deliver more gantries in fiscal '24 than in '23 as we move further from the chip supply headwinds while maintaining excellent demand visibility. Finally, in Surgical, we anticipate our full year fiscal '24 revenue growth to be at the high end of our 5% to 7% long-term target. Although impacted by fewer selling days, Q1 started the year strong, and we expect the business to perform well in Q2 and the remainder of the fiscal year. Moving next to margins. Our guidance assumes a cadence of improvement throughout fiscal '24 for both gross margin and operating margin. For gross margin, we anticipate Q2 levels similar to Q1, exiting the fiscal year in the low 60s. As well, our guidance assumes Q2 operating margins approaching 30% with the Q4 '24 exit rate around 31%. Continuing down the P&L. We expect Q2 operating expenses to step down from Q1. As a reminder, Q1 is typically our highest spend quarter seasonally as we kick off the fiscal year with our internal global sales meetings and major trade show events such as RSNA. For the balance of the year, we anticipate quarterly operating expenses to be about $300 million to $310 million. Below operating income, we estimate fiscal '24 other income net to be in an expense of approximately $10 million in Q2 and an expense between $30 million to $50 million for the full year. Our current guidance assumes an increase in interest income relative to our previous guide as we expect to have a higher cash balance throughout the remainder of the fiscal year. Our guidance is based on an annual effective tax rate of approximately 19.75% and diluted shares outstanding are expected to be approximately 239 million for the full year. To conclude, Q1 was a strong quarter across each of our businesses and sets us up nicely for the rest of the year. As we closed Q1, we moved forward to Q2 in fiscal '24 with good momentum. And as always, we remain focused on advancing women's health around the world while delivering on our promises and commitments to our shareholders, employees, customers and patients around the world. With that, we ask the operator to open the call for questions."", 'Operator', '(Operator Instructions) We will take our first question from Tejas Savant with Morgan Stanley.', 'Tejas Rajeev Savant', ""Congrats on the solid performance here. Steve, I want to start with the Molecular Diagnostics franchise. I want to ask you a little bit about Aptima there. You've talked in the past about the benefits of co-testing, the time it will take for physicians to embrace any change. That said, if guidelines move to HPV testing alone, how do you think about the upside on Aptima? And what, if any, should be the gating factors to transitioning those volumes? Are there any sort of differences in competitive dynamics for ThinPrep versus the HPV franchise?"", 'Stephen P. MacMillan', ""I think regardless of what happens with the guidelines, we see co-testing as being well entrenched. If anything, it's going to probably get stronger with the approval we just got last night of our digital cytology business, which I think is probably not as fully appreciated, but as we bring that to market, it's going to dramatically improve the workflow for our customers. It's going to improve the efficacy. It just -- it's probably the biggest improvement step forward in cytology in 40 years. So we remain very committed and believing incredibly strongly. By the way, as a reminder, it's a single collection device that is used both for our Aptima HPV as well as cytology. So it's no additional work for the doctor or the patient and you get the results. So we continue to be very excited and if anything probably more excited about our cytology business combined with our HPV business going forward."", 'Tejas Rajeev Savant', ""Got it. That's helpful. And then, Karleen, one for you on margins. So you talked about sort of exiting this year at about 31%. Can you just help us parse out the dynamics from the gantry chips with the higher cost coming through the backlog here versus your network optimization plans, what are the relative impacts of those 2 drivers? And as we look to fiscal '25, should we be thinking of that 31% as a good jumping off point, off of which you expect to see quarter-over-quarter expansion?"", 'Karleen M. Oberton', ""Yes. So let me take it in 2 parts. So on the gross margin line, the chips in the network optimization efforts are probably about a 50- to 75-point basis headwind to gross margins. And again, we see -- have line of sight to that improving over the course of the year. As we mentioned in our prepared remarks on operating expenses, if you looked at just Q1, if you took out the impact of kind of the seasonally high Q1 operating expenses -- operating margins would have been closer to 30%. So just moving through the year, as we see those dynamics at the gross margin and the new step-down in operating expenses, we see line of sight to exiting the year at 31%. I do think that is a good jumping off point. I think I would caution from significant improvement over the course of ['25] from there, given those are really, as we said, peer-leading operating expenses, and we always want to continue to make sure that we are investing the right amount back into our R&D and innovation and see the benefits like we saw last night with the approval of digital cytology."", 'Operator', 'We will take our next question from Patrick Donnelly with Citi.', 'Patrick Bernard Donnelly', ""Steve, maybe one for you on the Diagnostics business. It sounds like the rest of the year are going to kind of hang around that 5% to 7% framework inside there. I think one of the reasons for the uptick was improved utilization. Obviously, that utilization piece has been a big focus as we come out of COVID. Now that we're in a relatively -- hopefully, relatively stable environment on the testing side without COVID, can you just talk about utilization metrics that you're seeing? What gives you guys the confidence on that trajectory? Any metrics would be helpful there."", 'Stephen P. MacMillan', ""Yes. Sure, Patrick. I think the biggest metric, obviously, we track over time is just purely revenue. And I think we continue to feel good. But the internals on that are if you go customer by customer, we continue to grow our portfolio with a lot of our customers and not to be overlooked are our largest customers in the U.S. as they shift from TIGRIS to Panther, it is opening up additional menu opportunities for them to be adopting things like BV/CV and some of our other products. So we see really good growth with our largest customers in the U.S. We're also continuing to see and what we're still in the early-ish innings is the international expansion and all those Panthers we placed internationally during COVID as those are coming online. And I think what I love about these businesses, frankly, is they bring on 1 or 2 assays at a time, they get more experience and then they bring more. And so it's not like a one-off pop that, frankly, might be better in the short term but harder to lap. And so what we really have going on around the world are customers all over the place, just gradually bringing on either additional assays or as we come out with new menu being able to build that. And that installed base of Panthers that we're able to just drive more throughput through is what really makes us feel very good about the future."", 'Karleen M. Oberton', ""I'll just add 2 points to that, Patrick. While we haven't given a per Panther utilization, I would say that we are seeing that per Panther utilization grow year-over-year. And the other metric I would give you is that we went back to 2019, around 20% of our customers were running 4 more assays that's probably close to double here at the end of '23. So those are the things that should give us confidence of the stickiness of the Panther and the customers are adding menu."", 'Operator', 'We will take our next question from Jack Meehan with Nephron Research.', 'Jack Meehan', ""Steve, there's always next season soon enough."", 'Stephen P. MacMillan', ""That's right. Essex is also a big Eagle's fan."", 'Jack Meehan', 'Yes, the pain train. Well, I wanted to get your thoughts on the Diagnostics business at Biotheranostics. Could you just give us an update, talk about the growth runway for the Breast Cancer Index test? And I think, Karleen, you mentioned growth was accretive, but did it slow a little bit? Was that related to selling days? Or just any color would be great.', 'Stephen P. MacMillan', ""Yes. I think, Jack, the more we look at the BCI test and the opportunities ahead of us, I think we're still in the earlier innings on what that business can become. And there's -- since we've owned it, and watching the team operate. I think we just feel incredibly good about the long-term potential. So it was still well accretive and still growing nicely here. We just don't want to be breaking it out down to the level given the size of it, but feel really, really good about the opportunity."", 'Jack Meehan', ""All right. And then the cash on the balance sheet, continue to get a lot of questions around M&A priorities for Hologic. The recent questions we've got have been around interest in doing things in the med tech world. I was wondering if you could just comment on that. And then kind of on the Biotheranostics team, just like the world of specialty labs kind of using that as a foray into that world? Just any color on M&A strategy would be great."", 'Stephen P. MacMillan', ""Yes. I think, Jack, I think the magic that because we are both diagnostics and med tech, to your first part of that question, it does open up the opportunity for additional things. And we're seeing some interesting things that would allow us to build on our surgical platform or our breast cancer, the breast surgery business areas. So we continue to look in those areas. And frankly, I think some of the valuations in those areas might be a little bit better than, say, for example, some of the diagnostics ones. So I think we certainly can shop in that aisle. And coming back to the second part of your question, the other aisle we can shop in specialty labs. I think one of the things we're really proud of with Biotheranostics is it actually makes money, which you very well know that a lot of the specialty labs, there's a lot of great top line revenue, but a lot of expense and not much profit. And so I think we continue to want to be thinking about things that can be generating bottom line as Karleen is staring at me hard right now. I'm making part of that up, but I've worked with long enough to know her discipline. So we're being very mindful and careful in that space and continuing to feel like what we know we're good at is taking existing assets that are on the market and operating them pretty well. We don't want to take on wildly dilutive things just because we have the cash, and we continue to, I think, be patient and the underlying performance of our businesses continues to give us that ability to be patient. So hopefully, that gave you the landscape here, Jack. Thank you."", 'Operator', 'We will take our next question from John Sourbeer with UBS.', 'John Newton Sourbeer', 'Just a question on the -- to start off on the Breast Health business. Any updates on what the backlog looks like there? And how many quarters of backlog that you have? And just how would that compare to a normal backlog in that business?', 'Karleen M. Oberton', ""Yes. I think we certainly have several quarters of backlog probably going into early '25 at what I'll call elevated levels. We, traditionally, have backlog for this business, given the capital nature of it, but we see it being elevated for probably the next 3 to 5 quarters as we work through that backlog and supply the gantries to our customers."", 'John Newton Sourbeer', ""Got it. And then as a follow-up, on the Diagnostics business and the Panther, I appreciate that you're not providing pull-through there, I mean but a bit, just any way like quantitative or qualitatively, to provide on just what type of improvement on customer spending you're seeing with the addition of the Fusion sidecar?"", 'Karleen M. Oberton', ""So what I would say is that the respiratory menu is on the Fusion sidecar and that's where we see the most upside coming through in that respiratory menu. But certainly, as we've talked about, BV/CV is really leading the growth in the Molecular Diagnostics business at this point, primarily in the U.S. longer term, that's a great opportunity internationally, but also seeing customers take on some of our legacy women's health assays as well. So feel good about that the whole menu is driving the growth, but led by BV/CV at this point."", 'Operator', 'We will take our next question from Vijay Kumar with Evercore ISI.', 'Vijay Muniyappa Kumar', ""Steve, maybe my first one for you here. It was helpful for you to talk about those growth drivers. I'm curious, what percentage of revenues do you think are growing high single sustainably? What percentage should be growing with mid-single-ish? And what percentage of your revenues are low singles? Have you looked at that analysis? I'm just curious on when you say 5 to 7, how investors could get comfortable when they do the sum of the parts between on the business segments?"", 'Stephen P. MacMillan', ""Yes. I think we think about it by business segment. And I think what we've really said, Vijay, is that each of our businesses this year should be within that 5% to 7%. So I think that has us feel really good. Obviously, within each of the businesses, we're not going to go down to product line by product line, right? But if you played it out, right? Surgical, you got MyoSure and Fluent growing faster than that, you have NovaSure lower than that, right? We've got that always across the businesses. But I think the way to think about it is we feel really good about each of our businesses growing in that range. And I would tell you that internationally, each of those businesses is certainly at the higher end of that range, if not slightly beyond. So we've got it across, every business has growth drivers. And like any business, there's always a few that aren't growing as fast. And that's just the nature of the beast. But overall, I think what we're -- again, magically, every one of our businesses is in that frame."", 'Vijay Muniyappa Kumar', ""Understood. And Karleen, maybe one for you on the guidance, like Q1 came in mid-singles despite the days headwinds, 2Q guidance is for about [$3.5]. Why -- when I just think about the $3.5 versus the [$5] you did in Q1, is it just the comps? What's driving 2Q? And when you think about the back half step up from first half to hit the annual guide is just days normalization in the back half? Or any other drivers we should be looking at for the back half?"", 'Karleen M. Oberton', ""Yes. The biggest issue here in Q2 is the comps that is driving that. So if you looked at Q2 of '23, ex COVID grew almost 15%, Molecular within that, grew almost 24%, breast over 25% and surgical over 25%. So I think what we've been saying all along is that Q2 was just an outstanding quarter, proud of that quarter. As we went into Q3 and Q4, we have more normalized comps that were going against that drive that improved growth rate in the back half."", 'Operator', 'We will take our next question from Anthony Petrone with Mizuho Group.', 'Dimitri Tahal', 'This is Dimitri speaking for Anthony. Congratulations on great quarter. I just wanted to ask about like the Molecular Diagnostics ex COVID, it seems like it might have slowed down this quarter versus like year-over-year. And just a little bit more color on that this quarter and kind of like your expectations for Q2, you see like a stronger respiratory virus season? How should we think about that?', 'Stephen P. MacMillan', ""Yes. I think the big piece that affected Molecular in the quarter, the single biggest was the 4 fewer selling days. It's a disposable run rate business. And if you think about that, that knocked between 400 and 600 basis points off the quarterly growth rate, frankly, depending on exactly how the days fall. And both that quarter and this quarter that we're in now the second quarter are going against these ridiculously strong comps of over 20-ish percent Molecular growth from a year ago. But I think the overall run rate and the sheer size of the business is now, we feel very good about."", 'Dimitri Tahal', 'Sounds great. And you guys gave full year guidance for COVID. Should we be thinking about that kind of the new baseline now going forward?', 'Karleen M. Oberton', ""Yes. I think as we've talked about, we think of COVID as upside. So the guide would indicate is a continued step down each quarter. I mean, it's hard to really tell us the another flu season next year that drives a little elevated COVID. But again, we just -- we're looking at it as upside. And so I would maybe even think about something less than what we're anticipating for '24 and '25."", 'Operator', 'We will take our next question from Puneet Souda with Leerink Partners.', 'Puneet Souda', ""Steve, so first one on Genius digital DX system. Can you just remind me, and I apologize if I missed this, any changes to pricing or margins as a result? And maybe just -- I know ThinPrep remains the same, but can you just talk a little bit about how do you see the adoption of this in a market that's fairly established already? And then I have a follow-up for Karleen."", 'Stephen P. MacMillan', ""Sure. Thanks, Puneet. Yes, I don't assume any real change in the margin structure. I think the real win here is the workflow. I will tell you our key customers are incredibly excited. As you well know, right, one of the biggest issues right now running labs, everything else is workers and psychologists, especially trying to read these slides. It's been a very manual and labor-intensive process. I can tell you going back to one of my first meetings with Quest when I got in this role almost 10 years ago, I called that meeting 9 years ago with discussions around the workflow of cytology and it was one of the biggest concern. So our team has gone out and really addressing that. And I think the magic is going to be unleashing that as we are internationally as well. It's been part of what's starting to drive the growth in our European business has been having that approval already over there. So feeling really good as well as, frankly, the reduction of the false negatives, so it's just that much more accurate and going forward. So I think it's going to be -- we think it's going to bring some new life, particularly, it's been the excitement from our customers that I think has been the galvanizing part for us."", 'Puneet Souda', ""Got it. That's very helpful. And then, Karleen, I wanted to ask about the tax rate. How are you thinking about the net result of the 15% global tax rate if that was implemented? And then R&D tax credit that just sort of came through with the tax bill passing in the house? Netting those effects, how should we think about the tax rate longer term for Hologic?"", 'Karleen M. Oberton', ""Yes. So let me first frame that to the extent the global minimum tax rate is in effect, for us, it doesn't impact us to fiscal '26. So we've got some time before we have to deal with that. But I would say given the lack of legislation here in the U.S., it's really hard to say what the impact is. But I would tend to think it would be more on the mineral side given that our tax rate is already over the 15%. And in regards to the change in the amortization for R&D expense, probably minimally favorable for us, but really a minimal impact given that's just a timing issue really in any event."", 'Operator', 'We will take our next question from Ryan Zimmerman with BTIG.', 'Ryan Benjamin Zimmerman', ""I want to start with Breast Health a little bit. I have the opportunity to spend some time with Eric and the team at RSNA. And I'm just curious because you mentioned the increase in gantries and just help us understand kind of where we're at in the placement of gantries relative to sockets. And just how much of the growth is coming from new software like Genius AI detection and things like that. And as we normalize for comps, what the right way to think about the growth of the Breast Health business is given this mix now that's moving maybe away from equipment to more software?"", 'Stephen P. MacMillan', ""Yes, Ryan, I wouldn't underestimate that there's still going to be continued gantry placement. So a lot of it -- the core is actually still the gantry replacements. And then it's the service in the revenue and the additional AI and other things that we sell underneath it. But I think we continue to feel very good about gantry placements really from a couple of standpoints. First off, there's still kind of the tail end of going from 2D to 3D, but we're really into the mode now of also the early adopters of 3D. Their machines are now need to be upgraded. And with all the additional enhancements we've made to the system, we continue to place those gantries. So I think it's -- we've turned it into certainly a much more diversified business. But at the core, the gantries are still a very key foundational component of the strength of our business."", 'Ryan Benjamin Zimmerman', ""Okay. That's helpful, Steve. And then just piggybacking off that, I mean, love to get your assessment on the CapEx environment. We've heard from some of your peers already. We have some 340B money that's kind of making its way back to hospitals, which may or may not be making its way into capital equipment demand. But I'd love to get your view of kind of the year ahead on the CapEx demand from Hologic's perspective."", 'Stephen P. MacMillan', ""Yes. I think we continue to feel pretty good from most of our customers around the CapEx side. I think when people were more fearful, 1 year, 1.5 years ago, we kind of felt like it was still okay. If there's a little bits to dribble back in, that's fine, too. But I think overall, we think we're in a reasonable position and not seeing any dramatic changes one way or the other, at least affecting our business. And again, we're not the biggest capital component for the hospitals as are the ERP systems or certainly the big iron piece. So we continue to feel like regardless, we're in a good position."", 'Operator', ""We'll take our next question from Casey Woodring with JPMorgan."", 'Casey Rene Woodring', ""Maybe one for Karleen. On the other income line, can you please be specific on what you're assuming for non-GAAP interest income, interest expense and other income for 2Q and the full year. By my math, I'm getting the $6 million of net interest and other income for 1Q and you're guiding to $30 million to $50 million of other expense for the year. So just trying to bridge 1Q through the rest of the year."", 'Karleen M. Oberton', ""Yes. So 1Q is a little unique in 2 pieces. Our interest income was actually higher than our interest expense, given that we still had a favorable interest rate hedge in place, which actually expired at the end of December. So moving forward, our interest expense, our weighted average cost of debt will increase about 100 basis points through the balance of the year, which really drives that slip and that interest expense will be higher than interest income to the tune of roughly the $30 million to $50 million. Also in Q1 is we had about $4 million to $5 million of benefit below the line from our mark-to-market investments which really are EPS neutral as they offset mark-to-market liability on deferred compensation. So we really don't forecast any benefit or expense related to that because again, this offset in operating expenses. So it's really maintaining a high cash balance and assuming some deployment as we exit the year, but it's really that expiration of that interest rate hedge contract that drives higher interest expense."", 'Casey Rene Woodring', ""Got it. That's helpful. And then maybe just if I can sneak one more in. On the international piece, saw very strong growth there above the fleet average, I think, 33% constant currency in breast. I know international revenue is inherently lower margin. You've talked about that before. But curious if you're doing anything there to drive that contribution margin higher, any investments you're making outside the U.S.? And how should we think about international margin expansion versus the fleet average kind of moving forward?"", 'Stephen P. MacMillan', ""Yes. We're really proud of what the international team has been doing and looking at selective pricing opportunities. They've been very disciplined on the cost side. So that we're still dilutive -- our international growth is still dilutive certainly to the gross margin and a touch on the operating margin, but our teams are being very disciplined in trying to help lessen that gap over time."", 'Karleen M. Oberton', ""Yes. And I think there's opportunities as we go direct in key markets, not only do we see better revenue performance, but that is usually typically accretive to the margin line as well."", 'Operator', 'We will take our next question from Derik De Bruin with Bank of America.', 'Derik De Bruin', ""Sorry, I don't do -- I typically don't do sports references. So I won't make one. But just out of so I know you say that the market's not trench warfare. But I mean you do have -- I mean, you do have really strong competitors in viral load testing and STI testing. How should we sort of think about what your market shares are and what's around? Because I mean it is the market of the testing you're expanding for these? Or are they stagnant? I'm just sort of curious about sort of like market growth. And then can you talk a little bit about what your pipeline beyond BV/CV/TV? And just the what other sort of like molecular assays can be sort of be added? So it's a question on Mike, what's the market expansion opportunities in some of these markets that are more, I would say, competitive and hadn't historically grown a lot and versus what's the new pipeline?"", 'Stephen P. MacMillan', ""Derik, starting -- there's certainly -- we face very formidable competitors, and there's a lot of hand-to-hand combat. The flip side is, and I think it is the piece that people consistently miss is how much opportunity there is to expand our markets, right? And let's go to Surgical for a moment. Nobody ever would have imagined that MyoSure would have someday gotten to be as big as NovaSure when we first launched it. And now it dwarfs NovaSure and is still growing strongly. As we've come out with BV/CV, BV/CV may become our largest assay. It's -- sometimes it's hard to fully understand the impact and the size of the market creation that we're doing. So we just want people to understand it, it's hard to fully identify because we're growing and building these markets. And when you look at even some of the data that we got from the Global Women's Health Index, where women's health sits and testing sits globally is still a fraction of what it should be, right? If you consider that only 10% of all women in the world got tested that should for STIs. That alone would say the market is probably 10x. Now we're not going to realize that in the next 5 years either. So to call the total available market truly 10x because it's not quite accessible at that level, it's where we're in between. So I think that the gist is we continue to pioneer new products, new assays and grow and create these markets over time."", 'Operator', 'We will take our next question from Michael Matson with Needham & Company.', 'Michael Stephen Matson', ""Yes. I wanted to follow up on the earlier question just on the gantries in the mammography business. So I understand that you've made a number of enhancements and so forth. But I believe the platforms fairly been around for a while now. So I mean, is there any -- and I know you're not trying to be as capital focused, boom bust and all that stuff. But it seems like every company has got to kind of launch a new platform every once in a while. So I mean is that something we could see in the near term maybe?"", 'Stephen P. MacMillan', ""Yes, completely. So first, as a reminder, recall that we did launch our 3D performance and then our 3D, and what we've been doing is gradually improving and working on better imaging, better detection all through. So it's not like we're selling a 10-year-old product even though we had -- it's now 10 years a little -- 11 years since we got the 3D approved. But we've been selling newer products along the way. And having said that, we are working on additional hardware and gantry changes as well that will evolve here over the next few years."", 'Michael Stephen Matson', ""Okay. And then just on M&A, I think there was another question kind of about the areas that you're looking at, but I guess I wanted to ask about just potential size of the deals, Steve, because I feel like you kind of hit it or maybe directly commented in the past that you are potentially open to larger deals if you found the right thing and by larger, I mean, kind of $1 billion-plus."", 'Stephen P. MacMillan', ""Yes, I think we would consider something in that range if it brings significant revenue and frankly, EBITDA. So we're not going to embark on something of that size for a science project or something early stage or something that's losing money. I would say you would only expect us to do something like that. We have the capacity but it would have to be a pretty special asset. There's not a lot of things, but there are a few things we're looking at in that range. And we continue to be incredibly disciplined, but it would be established businesses that we think we could improve upon in terms of their ability to contribute to us."", 'Ryan M. Simon', ""Cynthia, this is Ryan. In consideration of time, we'll take 1 final question."", 'Operator', 'And we will go next to Navann Ty with BNP.', 'Navann Ty Dietschi', ""Maybe my first question, if you can discuss your AI capabilities versus competition including in Breast Health versus the recent innovation with competitors? And a second question, following up on your comments regarding the vaginitis international that you're leading. Can you discuss the size of the long-term opportunity outside of the U.S. and any potential structural differences?"", 'Stephen P. MacMillan', ""Yes. I think relative to the AI front as it relates to Breast Health, we've been on the leading edge for quite some time between our CAD programs and the A -- the Genius AI detection program. So we continue to feel very good particularly as it relates to the workflow advantages and the linkage to our workstations and our products. And on the second question of international, I think, again, we've been generating, frankly, double-digit growth for our international business for the better part, excluding COVID-ish for the last 5 or 6 years and continue to see international being accretive to our overall growth rate here for years to come. So thank you very much."", 'Operator', ""This concludes today's question-and-answer session. And this now concludes Hologic's First Quarter Fiscal 2024 Earnings Conference Call.

The Company defines its non-GAAP net income, EPS, and other non-GAAP financial measures to exclude, as applicable: (i) the amortization of intangible assets; (ii) the impairment of goodwill and intangible assets and equipment and the loss to record assets held-for-sale to fair value less costs to sell; (iii) adjustments to record contingent consideration at fair value; (iv) charges to write-off inventory for a product line discontinuance; (v) restructuring charges, facility closure and consolidation charges (including accelerated depreciation), and costs incurred to integrate acquisitions (including retention, transaction bonuses, legal and professional consulting services); (vi) transaction related expenses for acquisitions; (vii) third-party expenses incurred related to the implementation of the European MDR/IVDR requirements and obtaining the appropriate approvals for its existing products; (viii) debt extinguishment losses and related transaction costs; (ix) the unrealized (gains) losses on the mark-to-market of foreign currency contracts to hedge operating results for which the Company has not elected hedge accounting; (x) litigation settlement charges (benefits) and non-income tax related charges (benefits); (xi) other-than-temporary impairment losses on investments and realized gains and losses resulting from the sale of investments; (xii) the impacts related to internal restructurings and non-operational items; (xiii) other one-time, non-recurring, unusual or infrequent charges, expenses or gains that may not be indicative of the Company's core business results; and (xiv) income taxes related to such adjustments. The Company defines adjusted EBITDA as its non-GAAP net income plus net interest income/expense, income taxes, and depreciation and amortization expense included in its non-GAAP net income. The Company defines its net leverage ratio as the principal amount of its debt net of cash and cash equivalents, divided by its EBITDA for the last four quarters. The Company defines its adjusted ROIC as its non-GAAP operating income tax effected by its non-GAAP effective tax rate divided by the sum of its average net debt and stockholders’ equity, which is adjusted to exclude the effects of goodwill and intangible assets and equipment impairment charges."", ""These non-GAAP financial measures should be considered supplemental to, and not a substitute for, financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP. The Company's definition of these non-GAAP measures may differ from similarly titled measures used by others."", ""The non-GAAP financial measures used in this press release adjust for specified items that can be highly variable or difficult to predict. The Company generally uses these non-GAAP financial measures to facilitate management's financial and operational decision-making, including evaluation of Hologic's historical operating results, comparison to competitors' operating results and determination of management incentive compensation. These non-GAAP financial measures reflect an additional way of viewing aspects of the Company's operations that, when viewed with GAAP results and the reconciliations to corresponding GAAP financial measures, may provide a more complete understanding of factors and trends affecting Hologic's business."", ""Because non-GAAP financial measures exclude the effect of items that will increase or decrease the Company's reported results of operations, management strongly encourages investors to review the Company's consolidated financial statements and publicly filed reports in their entirety. A reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures is included in the tables accompanying this release."", 'Conference Call and Webcast', 'Hologic’s management will host a conference call at 4:30 p.m. ET today to discuss its financial results for the first quarter of fiscal 2024.

Unfortunately, these high risk investments often have little probability of ever paying off, and many investors pay a price to learn their lesson. A loss-making company is yet to prove itself with profit, and eventually the inflow of external capital may dry up."", ""So if this idea of high risk and high reward doesn't suit, you might be more interested in profitable, growing companies, like Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX). Now this is not to say that the company presents the best investment opportunity around, but profitability is a key component to success in business."", ' See our latest analysis for Netflix ', ""The market is a voting machine in the short term, but a weighing machine in the long term, so you'd expect share price to follow earnings per share (EPS) outcomes eventually. That makes EPS growth an attractive quality for any company. Impressively, Netflix has grown EPS by 26% per year, compound, in the last three years. As a general rule, we'd say that if a company can keep up that sort of growth, shareholders will be beaming."", ""Top-line growth is a great indicator that growth is sustainable, and combined with a high earnings before interest and taxation (EBIT) margin, it's a great way for a company to maintain a competitive advantage in the market. The good news is that Netflix is growing revenues, and EBIT margins improved by 2.8 percentage points to 21%, over the last year. Ticking those two boxes is a good sign of growth, in our book."", 'In the chart below, you can see how the company has grown earnings and revenue, over time. Click on the chart to see the exact numbers.', ""The trick, as an investor, is to find companies that are going to perform well in the future, not just in the past. While crystal balls don't exist, you can check our visualization of consensus analyst forecasts for Netflix's future EPS 100% free."", ""Since Netflix has a market capitalisation of US$246b, we wouldn't expect insiders to hold a large percentage of shares. But we are reassured by the fact they have invested in the company. Notably, they have an enviable stake in the company, worth US$2.1b. We note that this amounts to 0.9% of the company, which may be small owing to the sheer size of Netflix but it's still worth mentioning. So despite their percentage holding being low, company management still have plenty of reasons to deliver the best outcomes for investors."", ""You can't deny that Netflix has grown its earnings per share at a very impressive rate. That's attractive. Further, the high level of insider ownership is impressive and suggests that the management appreciates the EPS growth and has faith in Netflix's continuing strength. Fast growth and confident insiders should be enough to warrant further research, so it would seem that it's a good stock to follow. Of course, identifying quality businesses is only half the battle; investors need to know whether the stock is undervalued. So you might want to consider this free discounted cashflow valuation of Netflix."", 'Although Netflix certainly looks good, it may appeal to more investors if insiders were buying up shares.

The company predicted “mid-single-digit” sales growth for the coming year, a far cry from the 9% growth analysts expected. It’s also looking to offload its leftover Yeezy shoe inventory after terminating its deal with rapper Ye, formerly known as Kanye West.', 'Adidas joined competitors Nike and Puma in cutting expectations for the coming year, causing concern among some that consumer spending could be pulling back, despite stronger-than-expected numbers in 2023.', 'Adidas CEO Bjorn Gulden acknowledged in a statement that the company’s financial performance was “not good,” and on its Wednesday earnings call asked for patience as the company continues to make progress.', '“Consumer sentiment around the world is, of course, not great. It’s not like people are lining up everywhere to buy product,” Gulden said.', 'When reached for comment, an Adidas spokesperson directed Fortune to a company press release. A spokesperson for Puma said the company could not comment because it is in its quiet period, and Nike did not immediately respond to a request for comment.', 'With high-profile layoffs at big tech companies in the news, pay raises cooling, and American workers nervous and staying in their jobs more, it’s possible that consumers will pull back on nonessential spending. The average consumer likely wants to make their money stretch, which could hurt shoe and apparel companies that have struggled to keep people shopping at higher price points, Citi analyst Monique Pollard told Reuters.', '“It does suggest that consumers are a bit more focused on getting value for money,” she said.', 'This trend can also be seen in streaming, another industry likely to see some pullback if consumer spending weakens. Last week, industry leader Netflix reported strong revenue and profit results for 2023, but its competitors have not seen similar success.', 'As the price of streaming services continues to rise, consumers may increasingly decide to rely on one service and cut out all the others. “It’s logical to expect further consolidation” in the industry, Netflix said in an investor letter.', 'Although a pullback in consumer spending would be a setback for the economy, it might just be a positive for Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell.', 'Powell, attentive to the so-far slow cooling of inflation, indicated at a Wednesday press conference that the Federal Reserve would not be cutting rates soon, despite misplaced hope from investors.', 'A slowdown in spending may help change his mind—with consumers less willing to spend, producers and retailers would be incentivized to lower prices, which could finally bring inflation to the Fed 2% target.', 'This story was originally featured on Fortune.com']"

The S&P 500 enjoys a bull market and has touched record highs after spinning in a tight trading range for quite some time.', 'The broader index gained more than 3% in January, as solid economic growth crushed recession fearmongering while inflationary pressure cooled down to levels that encouraged the Federal Reserve to take a dovish stance.', ""The uptick in consumer outlays and strength in the labor market helped the U.S. economy expand at an annualized rate of 3.3% in the fourth quarter of 2023, which followed an annual growth of 4.9% in the third quarter, per the Commerce Department. Strong back-to-back readings came in despite the Fed's monetary tightening measures."", 'In reality, consumer spending increased by 2.8% in the final quarter of 2023, while business investments and government spending also improved. On the other hand, jobs are being added to the economy at a steady clip and the jobless rate remains low.', 'Needless to say, economic slowdown fears are now on the back burner, with most of the respondents surveyed by the National Association of Business Economics agreeing that there is a 50% or less chance of the U.S. economy heading into a recession in the upcoming one-year span as prices pressures have eased and supply-chain issues have ebbed.', ""Talking about inflation, the Fed's preferred measure of inflation, the personal consumption expenditures price index, increased only 1.7% in the fourth quarter, less than the 2.6% increase in the third quarter, and very much around the Fed's target of 2%. With price pressures falling, the Fed is expected to trim interest rates this year, which boosts consumer spending and business investments."", 'Thus, with things looking up for the economy, the stock market is poised to gain for the rest of the year. Historically, the rest of the year\'s performance is dependent on how stocks performed in January, better known as the ""January barometer.""

However, causing a huge disappointment to market participants, the central bank clearly said that it is highly unlikely that the first interest rate cut will occur in March.', 'Fed Chairman Jerome Powell said, “Based on the meeting today, I would tell you that I don’t think it’s likely that the committee will reach a level of confidence by the time of the March meeting to identify March as the time to do that. But that’s to be seen.”', 'At the same time, the post-FOMC statement removed the part that signaled the central bank still has a tightening bias. This categorically means that the rate hike rate regime, which started in March 2022, is over.', 'Powell added, “We believe that our policy rate is likely at its peak for this tightening cycle and that if the economy evolves broadly as expected, it will likely be appropriate to begin dialing back policy restraint, at some point this year.”', 'Following the Fed’s decisions, Wall Street fell sharply. The Dow slid 0.8%, marking its worst day since December. The S&P 500 fell 1.6% to post its worst day since September. The Nasdaq Composite plummeted 2.2%, recording its worst single-day performance since October.', 'The impressive bull run is set to continue in 2024. The Fed in all probability, will initiate a rate cut latest by June. A lower interest rate regime will boost economic growth speeding up investment by businesses. In 2022, small-cap companies suffered from record-high inflation, a soaring interest rate and fear of an impending recession. However, in 2023, this segment of the economy found some relief from these three concerns. The rate cut will further boost mid and small-sized enterprises.', 'A lower interest rate regime will be beneficial to high-growth sectors like technology and consumer discretionary. Several companies in these spaces depend on cheap sources of credit as the full potential of their business is realized over a long period. A low risk-free interest rate will reduce the discount rate thereby increasing the net present value of investment in these stocks.', 'The global supply-chain system has been improving slowly since last year as U.S. corporate behemoths are rescheduling their supply-chain system’s bypassing of China. Moreover, the fundamentals of the U.S. economy remain firm despite record-high inflation and interest rate.', 'The Department of Commerce reported that the U.S. economy grew at a rate of 3.3% in fourth-quarter 2023, well above the consensus estimate of 2%. The U.S. GDP rose 2.5% in 2023 compared with 1.9% in 2022. At the beginning of 2023, the consensus estimate for full-year GDP was 2%. The resilient labor market started showing softness but it hasn’t crumbled. Personal consumption remains robust.', 'Finally, a preliminary estimate revealed that a massive $1.4 trillion entered U.S. money market funds primarily due to an extremely high interest rate regime, with cash yielding around 5%. A systematic decline in the market interest rate will shift a major part of these gigantic funds to equity markets.\xa0\xa0\xa0 ', 'In this regard, every dip will be a good buying opportunity even for those stocks that have skyrocketed in 2023 and have strong potential for 2024 and beyond.

It was a credible result overall, with revenues of US$147b and statutory earnings per share of US$15.48 both in line with analyst estimates, showing that Phillips 66 is executing in line with expectations. The analysts typically update their forecasts at each earnings report, and we can judge from their estimates whether their view of the company has changed or if there are any new concerns to be aware of. We've gathered the most recent statutory forecasts to see whether the analysts have changed their earnings models, following these results."", ' View our latest analysis for Phillips 66 ', ""After the latest results, the consensus from Phillips 66's twelve analysts is for revenues of US$136.5b in 2024, which would reflect a discernible 7.4% decline in revenue compared to the last year of performance. Statutory earnings per share are forecast to descend 19% to US$13.16 in the same period. Before this earnings report, the analysts had been forecasting revenues of US$136.7b and earnings per share (EPS) of US$12.66 in 2024. The analysts seems to have become more bullish on the business, judging by their new earnings per share estimates."", ""There's been no major changes to the consensus price target of US$145, suggesting that the improved earnings per share outlook is not enough to have a long-term positive impact on the stock's valuation. The consensus price target is just an average of individual analyst targets, so - it could be handy to see how wide the range of underlying estimates is. There are some variant perceptions on Phillips 66, with the most bullish analyst valuing it at US$166 and the most bearish at US$119 per share. Analysts definitely have varying views on the business, but the spread of estimates is not wide enough in our view to suggest that extreme outcomes could await Phillips 66 shareholders."", ""These estimates are interesting, but it can be useful to paint some more broad strokes when seeing how forecasts compare, both to the Phillips 66's past performance and to peers in the same industry. These estimates imply that revenue is expected to slow, with a forecast annualised decline of 7.4% by the end of 2024. This indicates a significant reduction from annual growth of 12% over the last five years. By contrast, our data suggests that other companies (with analyst coverage) in the same industry are forecast to see their revenue grow 0.05% annually for the foreseeable future. So although its revenues are forecast to shrink, this cloud does not come with a silver lining - Phillips 66 is expected to lag the wider industry."", ""The biggest takeaway for us is the consensus earnings per share upgrade, which suggests a clear improvement in sentiment around Phillips 66's earnings potential next year. Fortunately, the analysts also reconfirmed their revenue estimates, suggesting that it's tracking in line with expectations. Although our data does suggest that Phillips 66's revenue is expected to perform worse than the wider industry. There was no real change to the consensus price target, suggesting that the intrinsic value of the business has not undergone any major changes with the latest estimates."", 'Keeping that in mind, we still think that the longer term trajectory of the business is much more important for investors to consider. We have forecasts for Phillips 66 going out to 2026, and you can see them free on our platform here.', ""However, before you get too enthused, we've discovered 2 warning signs for Phillips 66 (1 is a bit unpleasant!) that you should be aware of."", 'Have feedback on this article?

And welcome to the Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2023 Philips 66 Earnings Conference Call. My name is Emily, and I’ll be your operator for today’s call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Please note that this conference is being recorded. I will now turn the call over to Jeff Dietert, Vice President, Investor Relations. Jeff, you may begin.', 'Jeff Dietert: Thank you. Welcome to Philips 66 fourth quarter earnings call. Participants on today’s call will include Mark Lashier, President and CEO; Kevin Mitchell, CFO; Tim Roberts, Midstream and Chemicals; Rich Harbison, Refining; and Brian Mandell, Marketing and Commercial. Today’s presentation can be found on the Investor Relations section of the Philips 66 website along with supplemental financial and operating information. Slide two contains our Safe Harbor statement. We will be making forward-looking statements during today’s call. Actual results may differ materially from today’s comments. Factors that could cause actual results to differ are included here, as well as in our SEC filings. With that, I’ll turn it over to Mark.', 'Mark Lashier: Thanks, Jeff. Welcome, everyone, to our fourth quarter earnings call. We delivered a strong quarter and a strong year. In 2023, our total shareholder return was 33% and we increased our quarterly dividend by 8%. Today we’re going to cover a few major items, including the reasons why Philips 66 is an attractive investment opportunity and we’ll highlight the progress we’ve made on our strategic priorities. Next, we’ll discuss our fourth quarter financial results. Then we look forward to your questions. On slide three, we summarize the attributes that make us a differentiated and attracted value proposition. Our diversified and integrated portfolio delivers strong returns on capital employed and a high payout ratio supported by dividend growth.', 'We’re on a path to increase mid-cycle adjusted EBITDA by 40% to $14 billion by 2030. In addition, 75% of this growth will be outside of Refining. We expect this growth and more stable cash flow to support our valuation going forward and contribute to attractive total shareholder returns. Our disciplined approach to capital allocation across our portfolio has contributed to an average return on capital employed of 13% since our formation in 2012, almost double our cost of capital. We’re committed to financial flexibility and our strong investment grade credit rating remains differentiated relative to our peers. We expect to return in excess of 50% of our growing operating cash flow to shareholders. All of these attributes will support a secure, competitive and growing dividend, strong share repurchases, as well as debt reduction at mid-cycle margins.', 'Slide four summarizes our achievements to-date on our strategic priorities. On our last call, we raised our targets and continue to successfully execute our plan to increase mid-cycle adjusted EBITDA and grow shareholder distributions. Since July of 2022, we’ve distributed $8.3 billion through share repurchases and dividends. We’re on track to achieve our $13 billion to $15 billion target by the end of 2024. The execution of our plan to enhance Refining operating performance has resulted in crude utilization rates above the industry average for four consecutive quarters. In fact, we operated at our highest annual rate since 2019. We remain focused on improving performance, increasing market capture and reducing costs to enhance our earnings per barrel.', 'In Midstream, our NGO wellhead to market business continues to exceed our expectations. The team has done a remarkable job of integrating DCP Midstream and captured run rate synergies of $250 million as of year-end and we expect over $400 million of synergies by 2025. Since increasing our ownership of DCP, the Midstream annual run rate for adjusted EBITDA has been $3.6 billion. The stable cash generation from our Midstream business has grown to a level that covers the company’s top capital priorities, funding sustaining capital and the dividend. We’re delivering on business transformation targets and remain laser focused on further reducing our cost structure in 2024. Kevin will be providing more details. In addition, we plan to monetize assets that no longer fit our long-term strategy.', 'These asset dispositions are expected to generate over $3 billion in proceeds that will support our strategic priorities, including returns to shareholders. Timing of these dispositions will be subject to satisfactory market conditions and any necessary regulatory approvals. Our total adjusted EBITDA in 2023 was $12.7 billion, reflecting above mid-cycle margins in Refining and nearly $6 billion contributed by our more stable Midstream and Marketing and Specialties businesses. We’re focused on disciplined capital allocation, only funding attractive, high-return projects across our portfolio. The Rodeo Renewed Project to convert our San Francisco Refinery into one of the world’s largest renewable fuels facilities is expected to generate strong returns.', 'The project’s progressing well and we expect to start up later this quarter. Looking forward, we’re well positioned to achieve our targets by capitalizing on the strengths of our diversified and integrated portfolio. We’ll do this through continued operating and commercial excellence to deliver significant shareholder value through the economic cycles as demonstrated by our total shareholder return of 33% in 2023. Our commitment to a secure, competitive and growing dividend has resulted in a 16% compound annual growth rate since 2012. Before I turn the call over to Kevin to review the financial results, I’d like to thank the Phillips 66 team for their continued dedication to safe and reliable operations. Our employees enable us to execute on our strategic priorities and deliver on our mission to provide energy and improve lives.', 'Kevin, over to you.', 'Kevin Mitchell: Thank you, Mark. I’ll start on slide five with an update on our business transformation progress and how we are reducing costs to sustain higher cash generation. We achieved $1.2 billion in run rate savings as of year-end 2023, comprised of $900 million of cost reductions and $300 million of sustaining capital efficiencies. Sustaining capital is one of our business transformation success stories. Our sustaining capital historically averaged about $1 billion per year and we added approximately $200 million with the consolidation of DCP Midstream. Despite the additional sustaining capital requirements from DCP, we reduced our sustaining capital spend to under $900 million in 2023. This $300 million benefit is also reflected in our 2024 capital plan.', 'Through the end of 2023, we realized $630 million in cost reductions. The majority of these cost reductions relate to Refining, operating and SG&A expenses, as well as benefits to equity earnings and gross margin. On slide six, we provide more detail on the cost reductions at the total company level. Adjusted controllable costs were $8.4 billion in 2023, compared with $8.1 billion in 2022. The chart illustrates the main cost drivers year-over-year, including the impact of a full year of DCP consolidation. We continue to realize cost synergies from the DCP acquisition and subsequent integration. Our successful business transformation has already reduced costs, including our share of WRB costs, by approximately $500 million and this work continues.', 'Slide seven provides a breakdown of Refining costs. Refining adjusted controllable costs, including turnaround expense and our proportionate share of WRB and MiRO controllable costs, decreased over $550 million to $5.2 billion in 2023. Business transformation savings reduced Refining costs by approximately $300 million. Additionally, lower turnaround expense and market impacts, primarily from lower utility prices, further reduced costs. These cost reductions more than offset inflationary impacts. On a $1 per barrel basis, adjusted controllable costs were $7.56 per barrel or $6.57 per barrel, excluding turnaround expense. This is a fully burdened cost that includes about $1 per barrel for Refining share of corporate allocations and SG&A expenses.', 'The business transformation savings reduced our 2023 adjusted costs by over $0.40 per barrel. We expect to achieve our full $1 per barrel run rate target by the end of 2024. Additional details can be referenced in the appendix to this presentation. Slide eight summarizes our fourth quarter results. Adjusted earnings were $1.4 billion or $3.09 per share. We generated operating cash flow of $2.2 billion, including cash distributions from equity affiliates of $226 million. Capital spending for the quarter was $634 million. We distributed $1.6 billion to shareholders through $1.2 billion of share repurchases and $457 million of dividends. Net debt to capital ratio was 34% at year-end 2023 and return on capital employed was 16% for the year. Slide nine highlights the change in results by segment from the third quarter to the fourth quarter.', 'During the period, adjusted earnings decreased $708 million, mostly due to lower results in Refining and Marketing and Specialties, partially offset by improved results in Midstream. In Midstream, fourth quarter adjusted pre-tax income of $754 million was a record, up $185 million from the prior quarter, reflecting improvements in both NGL and transportation. The NGL business increased primarily due to higher margins and record volumes at the Sweeney Hub, as well as lower operating costs. Transportation results were also higher, mainly reflecting the recognition of deferred revenue related to throughput and deficiency agreements. Chemicals adjusted pre-tax income increased $2 million to $106 million in the fourth quarter. This increase was mainly due to higher margins, mostly offset by lower equity earnings from CPChem’s affiliates and decreased sales volumes from lower seasonal demand.', 'Global O&P utilization was 94%. Refining fourth quarter adjusted pre-tax income was $797 million, down $943 million from the third quarter. The decrease was primarily due to lower realized margins. Realized margins decreased due to lower market crack spreads, partially offset by inventory hedge impacts, higher Gulf Coast clean product realizations, wider heavy crude discounts and strong commercial results. Market capture increased from 66% to 107%. Marketing and Specialties adjusted fourth quarter pre-tax income was $432 million, a decrease of $201 million from the previous quarter. The decrease was mainly due to a seasonal decline in domestic wholesale fuel margins, primarily in the Mid-Continent. Our adjusted effective tax rate was 23%. Slide 10 shows the change in cash during the fourth quarter.', 'We started the quarter with a $3.5 billion cash balance. Cash from operations excluding working capital was $2 billion. There was a working capital benefit of $207 million, mainly reflecting a reduction in inventory that was mostly offset by movements in accounts receivables and payables, which included the impact of declining commodity prices. We funded $634 million of capital spending and repaid approximately $100 million of debt. Additionally, we returned $1.6 billion to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends. Our ending cash balance was $3.3 billion. This concludes my review of the financial and operating results. Next, I’ll cover a few outlook items for the first quarter. In Chemicals, we expect the first quarter global O&P utilization rate to be in the mid-90s.', 'In Refining, we expect the first quarter worldwide crude utilization rate to be in the low 90s and turnaround expense to be between $110 million and $130 million. Our turnaround expense guidance excludes costs associated with the conversion and start-up of the Rodeo Renewable Fuels Facility. At our San Francisco Refinery, we are executing the Rodeo Renewed Project. The facility operated as a crude oil refinery in January. [Audio Gap]', 'Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] [Audio Gap] Apologies, everyone. We have lost connection to the speakers. Please stand by while we reconnect them.', 'Kevin Mitchell: … refinery, we are executing the Rodeo Renewed Project. The facility operated as a crude oil refinery in January and we will shut down crude operations in February, as we are prepared to start up renewable fuels production by the end of the quarter. We anticipate $100 million of decommissioning and start-up costs in the first quarter. We anticipate first quarter, corporate and other costs to come in between $290 million and $310 million.

You can skip our detailed analysis on this critical naval vessel and head over directly to the 5 Navies with the Most Submarines in the World.', 'Assessing the strength of a military requires a thorough scrutiny of the sophistication of its weaponry. There is great emphasis on submarines in modern warfare due to the crucial role these submersible vessels play underwater in both covert operations and offensive roles against adversaries. These watercrafts are an integral component in the arsenal of leading naval forces across the world.\xa0', 'While the United States undisputedly has the most powerful military in the world, it surprisingly is not on top spot when it comes to the fleet size of submarines. This, however, does not imply any deficiency in the realm because most of its submarines are of premium quality, powered with nuclear technology in contrast to a majority of other countries that are in the race.', 'The Virginia class is the latest class of submarines operated by the United States Navy. The nuclear-powered attack submersible first joined the Navy in 1998. Designed by General Dynamics Corporation (NYSE:GD)’s subsidiary, General Dynamics Electric Boat (GDEB), and Huntington Ingalls Industries, Inc. (NYSE:HII), the Virginia class offers multiple capabilities to the Navy, such as reconnaissance, land attack, anti-shipping, and special operations. According to a Congressional Research Service report in April 2019, the Virginia class costs between $2.8 to $3.2 billion per unit.', 'Australia is likely to become the second country after the United States to operate the Virginia class of submarines, as the US Navy plans on selling the used nuclear submarines to Australia under the AUKUS pact in 2032 and 2035. The monetary aspects of the agreement are not known. Australia’s Babcock International, which provides infrastructure in Adelaide and Perth for nuclear powered submarines, has already entered into a strategic partnership with Huntington Ingalls Industries, Inc. (NYSE:HII) to ‘provide critical capability requirements’ for the submarine program.', 'Another fast-attack, nuclear powered submarine operated by the US is the Seawolf class, which was developed during the 1980s to regain the Navy’s technological superiority over Soviet vessels. The submarine is nearly impossible to locate when it is cruising at 20 knots, and is ten times quicker than the Los Angeles class it succeeded. The Seawolf class was also built by General Dynamics Corporation (NYSE:GD).', 'The US Navy is also working on Columbia-class, its upcoming nuclear powered ballistic missile submarine, which is scheduled to enter service in 2031. The development work for the project started in October 2020, with General Dynamics Corporation (NYSE:GD) being chosen as the primary contractor and design lead, while Huntington Ingalls Industries, Inc. (NYSE:HII) serving as the primary contractor.\xa0', 'In 2020, it was reported that Lockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE:LMT) would provide fleet support for the strategic weapon system Trident for the Columbia-class submarine program. The US Navy last year in September marked the successful test launch of Trident II D5 Life Extension Fleet Ballistic Missile (FBM) from the Pacific Ocean. Jerry Mamrol, the VP of Lockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE:LMT)’s Fleet Ballistic Missiles, said on the occasion that his company was proud of the decades long partnership with the Navy, and looks forward to modernizing the missile for use in the Columbia-class of submarines. The D5 missile built by Lockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE:LMT) is one of the most advanced ballistic missiles in the world, with a nominal range of 4,000 nautical miles. It is currently used by the UK’s Vanguard-class and the US’s Ohio-class of submarines.', ""Other prominent submarines currently in operation include the United Kingdom's Astute-class, four of which are currently in service of the Royal Navy, and Russia's Graney-class and Sierra II-class submarines, with the former being the country's latest nuclear attack submarine that succeeded the Akula-class in 2013."", 'Copyright: 1971yes / 123RF Stock Photo', 'Navies with the most submarines in the world are ranked in ascending order of the fleet size of their submarines.

These include two Hashmat class submarines whose designs are based on French Agosta class submarines, three Khalid class submarines which are also known as Agosta-90B-class, and three Cosmos-class mini submarines designed by an Italian company.\xa0', 'Submarines: 8', 'Next on our list of navies with the most submarines in the world is Italy whose naval fleet consists of four Sauro-class and four Type 212A Todaro-class vessels. All eight of these are diesel-electric attack submarines. The Type 212A Todaro-class submarines also have air-independent propulsion enabled in them. The country has a large shipbuilding industry, with Fincantieri leading much of Italy’s naval constructions. In 2021, it was reported that Italy is also building two small submarines for Qatar, which is testament to the country’s naval export potential.', 'Submarines: 8', 'Four German-made, diesel electric S-44 submarines received between December 2016 and August 2021 as part of a $1.7 billion contract signed between Germany and Egypt in 2011 have bolstered Egypt’s naval strength. Prior to that, the only submarines the African nation had were four units of Chinese Type 033 Romeo-class – which are still operated by the Egyptian Navy.', 'Submarines: 9', 'France is among navies with the most submarines in the world. Its fleet size of nine submarines comprises five nuclear-powered submarines – Émeraude, Améthyste, Perle, Suffren, and Duguay-Trouin; and four nuclear ballistic missile submarines named Le Triomphant, Le Téméraire, Le Vigilant, and Le Terrible. The nuclear ballistic missile submarines are capable of carrying 16 M45 ballistic missiles and a TN-71 thermonuclear warhead.', 'Submarines: 10', 'According to the UK government, the Royal Navy operates 10 submarines, of which, six are nuclear submarines, while four are ballistic nuclear submarines. It is one of only six countries to possess all nuclear submarines, as noted by the Daily Express. The UK’s Astute class is one of the most powerful submarines in the world, capable of carrying 36 torpedoes, mines, Tomahawk cruise missiles, and anti-ship Harpoon missiles.', 'Submarines: 11', 'Greece is one of the countries with the most submarines in the world, with a fleet size of 11 – all of which are diesel-electric attack submarines. Of these, five are air-independent propulsion enabled according to NTI. In December 2018, the Greek government approved two programs to purchase 36 torpedoes for its Papanikolis-class submarines. The Papanikolis class is among Greece’s finest classes, with the capacity to travel at a speed of 20 knots and be submerged under water for 50 days.', 'Submarines: 12', 'The Turkish Navy operates 12 submarines, which comprises three classes of four units each – Gür (Type 209T2/1400), Ay (Type 209/1200), and Preveze (Type 209T/1400). All of these are diesel-electric submarines. By 2027, Turkiye plans on operating six Reis-class of submarines, which will enhance the strength of the Turkish Navy due to their air independent propulsion capabilities.', 'Submarines: 18', 'Half-way through the list comes India, with 18 submarines in its fleet. These include sixteen diesel-electric submarines, and two nuclear-powered submarines – INS Arihant and INS Arighat. In 2019, Delhi signed a $3 billion deal with Russia for the lease of Akula-class nuclear submarines for a period of 10 years. Under the pact, the first delivery is expected in 2025.', 'Submarines: 19', 'Next up is Iran, whose naval fleet of 19 submarines comprises fifteen Ghadir-class and Nahang-class of mini submarines, which possess tubes for firing torpedoes and anti-cruise missiles. The country also operates four diesel-electric submarines – one of these is locally built, while three were received from Russia.', 'Submarines: 22', 'South Korea’s navy operates 22 submarines, the largest of which is the Dosan Ahn Changho-class, with a displacement of more than 3,000 tonnes.

During the fourth quarter, NOV was awarded and began executing on an integrated directional drilling tool contract in the Middle East with an independent service company to drill 14 directional wells in Kuwait. Additionally, NOV's integrated directional drilling bottom hole assemblies (BHAs), which include Vector™ motors, Tolteq™ measurement while drilling (MWD) tools, and PowerStroke™ jars, were used to successfully drill two geothermal wells in Iceland, despite the challenging downhole conditions prevalent in this growing application."", 'NOV was selected to provide a custom intermediate-sized drill pipe with Tuboscope™ TKTM 340TC coating, specifically intended for deployment in Eagle Ford hot wells. The unique size and coating combination is expected to enhance drilling performance and extend the lifespan of rig tools when subjected to temperatures exceeding 350° F. NOV also secured orders for Delta™ 544 connections to be threaded on IntelliServ™ wired drill pipe for an upcoming project in the Middle East, facilitating near-instantaneous data transfer from downhole to the surface to provide drillers with clear insights to make informed decisions. This integration allows NOV to merge the cost-effectiveness of its premier Delta connection with the downhole telemetry offered by IntelliServ.', 'NOV secured a multi-year contract, after a four-year testing and approval process, from a major national oil company to provide TK™-Liner for 6 5/8"" premium connection tubulars used in offshore Water-Alternating Gas (WAG) wells for enhanced oil production. The high-performance glass-reinforced epoxy lining system is gaining widespread acceptance in major oil & gas and geothermal markets for its reliable protection and performance in corrosive environments. NOV also earned several repeat orders to provide TK™-340TC insulating coating for a major operator drilling in the Eagle Ford and Haynesville shale plays. With the use of TK-340TC to reduce thermal conductivity, the operator has been able to maintain lower drilling fluid temperatures throughout the string and reduce downhole equipment failures and downtime. Based on the significant cost savings and improved drilling efficiencies, four additional coated strings have been ordered.', 'NOV was selected to provide a complete coiled tubing equipment package tailored for geothermal wells for a client on the North Island of New Zealand. This package includes a two-piece coiled tubing unit consisting of a control power unit featuring NOV’s latest Hi-Vis Cabin equipped with the CTES™ OrionTM V data acquisition system, a reel trailer capable of carrying 29,200 feet of 2 7/8"" coiled tubing, an HR-6100 Injector, Texas Oil Tools pressure control equipment, and a Twin 1,200 BHP Fluid Pumper with sound attenuation capabilities. The pumper is equipped with our latest touchscreen control system, allowing remote control panel operation, along with two strings of 2 7/8"" QT900 Grade Quality Tubing.', 'Fourth Quarter Earnings Conference Call', 'NOV will hold a conference call to discuss its fourth quarter 2023 results on February 2, 2024 at 10:00 AM Central Time (11:00 AM Eastern Time).

This widely-known consensus outlook gives a good sense of the company's earnings picture, but how the actual results compare to these estimates is a powerful factor that could impact its near-term stock price."", 'The earnings report, which is expected to be released on February 8, 2024, might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.', ""While management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations, it's worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise."", 'Zacks Consensus Estimate', 'This maker of Behr paint, Delta faucets and other building products is expected to post quarterly earnings of $0.66 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +1.5%.', 'Revenues are expected to be $1.77 billion, down 7.7% from the year-ago quarter.', 'Estimate Revisions Trend', 'The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 0.56% higher over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.', 'Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts.', 'Earnings Whisper', ""Estimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. Our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) -- has this insight at its core."", 'The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.', ""Thus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only."", 'A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.', 'Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).', 'How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Masco?', ""For Masco, the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of -1.25%."", 'On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #4.', 'So, this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Masco will beat the consensus EPS estimate.', 'Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?', ""Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number."", 'For the last reported quarter, it was expected that Masco would post earnings of $0.91 per share when it actually produced earnings of $1, delivering a surprise of +9.89%.', 'Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates three times.', 'Bottom Line', 'An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.', ""That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported."", ""Masco doesn't appear a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release."", 'Stay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.', 'Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

A data initiative partly funded through the data.org Inclusive Growth and Recovery Challenge uses this kind of market data to deliver insights to help build their businesses.', 'The Mastercard Center for Inclusive Growth', 'BY VICKI HYMAN', 'In India, smallholder farmers are reducing their harvest loss and increasing their selling prices through the use of cold storage, which is connected to a mobile app that tracks the shelf life of produce in real time for digital inventory management.', ""In Mozambique, many laborers advertise for work by painting their phone numbers on planks nailed to trees. Now they're getting labor market insights delivered directly to their phones and access to tools to improve their marketing and business management skills."", ""And when auditing lending records from banks in Colombia, Mexico and India, researchers found a high risk of future bias against women applicants. The low representation of women in the existing data skewed the algorithms used to spot creditworthy applicants. So they built a new one that's gender-fair."", 'None of this would have been possible a decade ago. But the rise in connected devices and exponential growth in the data produced, combined with rapid advances in artificial intelligence and machine learning, has unleashed the potential of data science. Until recently, however, governments, nonprofits and civic organizations have lacked the budgets, staff and capacity to take full advantage of data science to help more people.', ""Founded by the Mastercard Center for Inclusive Growth and the Rockefeller Foundation in 2020, data.org democratizes data by forging partnerships around the world to harness data science to tackle society's most pressing issues. Among its initiatives: the Inclusive Growth and Recovery Challenge, which funded breakthrough data for social good concepts, including the three above, and the Capacity Accelerator Network, which aims to train a million data professionals by 2032 through hubs in more than 20 countries and counting. Mastercard continues to support data.org as it accelerates impact through data science at scale."", '""Data has the potential to widen the gap between the haves and have-nots,"" says Shamina Singh, founder and president of the Center for Inclusive Growth. ""We need to continue to do the work that\'s necessary to ensure that data science for social impact creates inclusive growth.""', ""The Mastercard Newsroom spoke to Singh and Danil Mikhailov, the executive director of data.org, about tackling the challenges facing the nascent field of data for social impact, why diversity is crucial in developing the talent pipeline and where they're seeing success."", 'Shamina, your work at the Center aims to reduce economic inequality and narrow the digital divide that perpetuates that inequality. There\'s also information inequality. What is the ""data divide"" and how does that manifest itself in the communities in which the Center works?', ""Singh: Data is power, and the enormous race we're seeing around AI right now is proof of that. What we need to keep top of mind is that the people who are losing the race are also those people who could benefit the most from data access. Information inequality is the idea that information is incredibly powerful, incredibly useful, and those who have access to it could really accelerate their growth, while those who don't have access or capacity could be left behind. This tracks with what we've seen in the financial inclusion space, where as more people entered the digital economy, we saw more people being left behind."", ""We're trying to address these gaps that are forming through data-driven initiatives and the intentional implementation of new technologies with inclusion at the forefront. What we're doing at the Center is creating capacity for the social sector to realize the power of their own data to put it to use for social good. That's the basis of this partnership and the creation of data.org - to actually create a new institution, a new way of doing this work using new technology and new data resources."", 'Danil, a year ago data.org released a report on the key trends and tensions as the field of data for social impact matures. What are some of the challenges that organizations still face? Has there been any progress? Has anything new popped up since generative AI has taken hold in the last year?', ""Mikhailov: Shamina, I love your framing of information inequality: the data haves and the data have-nots. That is still a reality. The gap isn't shrinking. The gap is increasing. We are making progress to try and reduce the rate at which the gap is increasing. We've been using data in different fields for decades, centuries. The current generation of data science technologies, including gen AI, is so new and is changing so fast, that it leads to a field that is very fragmented. Everyone is launching their startups or their new tools and approaches, which means it's hard to bring the field together around some of the common challenges. And the definition of what data for social impact is, or impact AI - they're new terms and the field hasn't yet coalesced around by what we mean by that. What data.org is doing is bringing together many of the actors in the space - social impact organizations, tech companies and startups, academic institutions, etc., around what we mean by them."", 'Can you give me an example?', ""Mikhailov: We've done a lot of work in defining a role we think is missing in the field - a data ecosystem designer. We think, fundamentally, what we need to make much healthier data ecosystems is to find people who will focus on bringing organizations together around certain principles. Just as in urban planning - building a healthy city that has good public spaces and private spaces, a good balance of architecture -you need somebody who is in charge. So we've been doing work with other organizations to unite around this concept of ethical data ecosystem design. Then we need to fix funding. There is a lot of work that needs to go into this, and Mastercard has been building sustainable funding streams for this kind of work. Technology is expensive. There's no way to avoid it. When you build data science techniques, you're competing with other big tech companies in the world. So what we've being doing is actually flipping this on its head by partnering with big tech giants, to connect them with the social impact sector, providing a channel to help the sector and for them to use their muscles to help lift others."", ""The report also called out the need for more data scientists, particularly in developing countries where the work can have great impact but also where there's perhaps not the educational infrastructure to train data scientists. What are you doing to address this?"", ""Mikhailov: We need more data scientists. We need them to be different. We need them in different places. First of all, numbers. We're not training enough data scientists for the new economy, not in the private sector let alone the social impact sector. So we need more investment in universities, more informal training, more professional training for those who already have jobs to retrain and add the desired skills to their existing skillsets. But we also need those people to be different. So we need to invest more in making sure that there are more women data scientists, and that there are more data scientists from different, currently disenfranchised, backgrounds, particularly in the Global South. We also need the skills to be different. So at the moment, we're teaching data science just as a technical discipline - mathematics, coding, which are hugely important. But often, to solve problems and create social impact, you need to understand the subject matter. So you need to understand, for example, when you talk about climate or health or financial inequality, what are the causes behind those problems? If you only have technical skills, you often can do more harm than good when you try to create solutions. So teaching data scientists to have the interdisciplinary skills of both the tech knowledge and understanding of the subject matter is something that we focus on in our Capacity Accelerator Network."", ""Singh: At Mastercard, we've always said the customer is at the center of our innovation, but the truth is that if you're coding or creating technologies or solutions, you're going to do so based on what you know, who you are and your life experiences. What we've intentionally tried to do with the Capacity Accelerator Network is expand the pool of tech talent in the development phase to ensure that the inputs represent the diversity of the communities, countries and regions we're operating in."", '""We want to ensure emerging technology, things like generative AI, are a part of the development from the outset. That inclusion is prioritized from the beginning.""', 'Shamina Singh', ""To accomplish this, we are working to ensure that we are providing training and building diversity in data science through engagements with things like HBCU networks and Hispanic-serving institutions to make sure we are building with - not just for - those who these solutions are meant to support. This is a divergence from the norm where the data haves or technology haves typically gain first access and then the technology makes its way to the rest of the population and they have to engage with something that's not necessarily built with them in mind. We want to ensure emerging technology, things like generative AI, are a part of the development from the outset. That inclusion is prioritized from the beginning."", ""When you think about the initiatives you've supported through data.org, what is one that you feel epitomizes the power of data for good?"", ""Mikhailov: I'll cheat and go for two. So one example is really kind of high-end, global, and one example is much more local. So on the high-end scale, it's Epiverse, a global collaborative developing a data analysis ecosystem that can help everyone get ahead of the next public health crisis. It's about creating a set of open-source tools for public health analysts and data scientists, epidemiologists, that kind of community. Obviously it's inspired by the pandemic; we need to act globally, and we need to be able to share insights quickly. It's now in a half dozen countries, and over the next few years, it's projected to scale to another 10 to 20 countries. Then I'd go for our Inclusive Growth and Recovery Challenge, where we supported nine great projects around the world, each of those in a very specific local setting, driven by local communities and having a lasting impact. For example, helping communities in the U.S. use data on brownfield sites in their cities to help communities regenerate that land."", ""Singh: Let me build on that. The importance of the Inclusive Growth and Recovery Challenge was that we wanted to create the demand and the supply for data science for social impact, a relatively new concept. Our intention is to utilize financial backing in selected winners to help them scale and yield further investment, growing their mission and our mission at the same time. The way you know it's successful is if that prize yields even more investment. And we've been thrilled to see this come to fruition, where notably the challenge winners have actually generated something like $30 million in additional investment. When others become invested in the capacity building, that's when you know change is happening."", 'Originally published by The Mastercard Center for Inclusive Growth', 'Check out more content from The Mastercard Center for Inclusive Growth', 'View additional multimedia and more ESG storytelling from The Mastercard Center for Inclusive Growth on 3blmedia.com.', 'Contact Info:Spokesperson: The Mastercard Center for Inclusive GrowthWebsite: https://www.3blmedia.com/profiles/mastercard-center-inclusive-growthEmail: info@3blmedia.com', 'SOURCE: The Mastercard Center for Inclusive Growth', 'View the original press release on accesswire.com']"

A replay of this call will be posted on our website for 30 days. With that, I will now turn the call over to our Chief Executive Officer, Michael Miebach."", ""Michael Miebach: Thank you, Devin. Good morning, everyone. Here's the headline. We closed out 2023 with another quarter of strong earnings and revenue growth. Quarter four net revenues were up 11% and operating income up 13%, both versus a year ago on a non-GAAP currency-neutral basis, excluding special items as always. These results were driven by healthy consumer spending and the ongoing execution of our strategy. Our deal momentum continued this quarter, powered by a broad range of unique diversified products and services both designed to solve our customers' needs. Let's start on the macroeconomic front, where we see both tailwinds and headwinds. First, the labor market remains strong with low unemployment and rising wages."", ""These remain key drivers of consumer spending. Some risks we're monitoring include credit availability and delinquency rates. Second, while inflation continues to moderate, prices of many goods and services remain elevated. We're tracking the efforts of central banks who are actively managing interest rates to normalize inflation. And finally, geopolitical uncertainty remains a concern in several markets. On balance, we remain fairly positive about the growth outlook, but we are monitoring the environment closely and we'll manage the business accordingly. Looking at our switch trends this quarter, domestic volume growth remains healthy and cross-border spending remains strong, up 18% globally in the fourth quarter on a local currency basis."", ""With that as a backdrop, we remain focused on our strategic priorities which fuel our growth algorithm across payments and services and new networks. In payments, our growth algorithm consists of five key areas. One, being in the flow to capture the natural growth of economies. Two, accelerating the secular shift to electronic payments across both spend and transactions. Three, further penetrating the addressable market in new flow. And four, growing market share, and five, optimizing our customer portfolios for performance. Economies are growing and that's not in our control. However, we are executing on the rest. Building on that, the runway for the secular shift is substantial. We are accelerating it by scaling acceptance, enhancing the user experience for digital transactions and driving adoption in new sectors and new use cases."", ""In 2023, we added millions of new acceptance locations worldwide. This growth has been aided by scaling our tap on phone and cloud commerce capabilities. We're now live in over 18 markets. Smaller merchants can start accepting payments by simply downloading an app, and larger merchants are leveraging the technology to promote quick and seamless checkout experiences anywhere in store. We're supporting partners like Apple, who in 2023 expanded tap to pay on iPhone into Australia, the UK, France, Brazil and several other markets. We're also accelerating the secular shift away from both from cash and closed-loop transactions such as transit through our contactless capabilities. Contactless provides a fast, secure and seamless consumer experience in areas like transit, which creates an opportunity to capture incremental transactions with a tap for every single ride."", ""And when consumers use contactless for transit, they often extend that behavior across other low dollar spend categories. We've made great progress with many major cities such as London and New York, operating broad-based open-loop systems. However, there's still significant runway for us given that only a small percentage of large cities globally are operating open-loop systems at scale. And we're leaning into advanced payment technologies like Click to Pay, tokenization and biometrics. They offer embedded, secure and password-free checkout solutions and with that bring an elevated level of security, simplicity and speed to every transaction. And that's true regardless of the device, browser, or card. These solutions not only benefit consumers, but they also create value for merchants as their customers are less likely to abandon a transaction and issuers also benefit from an increase in customer stickiness."", ""For Click to Pay, we are now live in over 35 countries supported by over 50 channel partners. And in 2023, we drove over 60% growth in transactions. Klarna will implement Click to Pay this year and activate their merchants across all European markets where they operate. We're driving tokenization across all channels including devices, commerce platforms, card on file and guest checkout. Tokenization reduces fraud and increases approval rates by approximately 3 to 6 percentage points across regions. And we're expanding our biometric payment capabilities, which enable payments with a smile or a wave. After launching in Brazil, we have now partnered with NEC Corporation to bring our biometric checkout to the Asia-Pacific region. We're also driving growth by winning and retaining deals across consumer payments, account to account and new flows."", 'This week, we shared that BOK Financial will flip its U.S. Debit portfolio to Mastercard, making us the exclusive partner across its debit and commercial portfolios. They selected us due to our differentiated virtual card and open banking assets fraud solutions and our shared commitment to financial inclusion. This marks the third U.S. regulated debit flip we signed in the last year building on our recent successes with Citizens and Webster Bank, both of which have now started converting their portfolios. And BPER Banca, one of the largest banks in Italy, will migrate their debit card portfolio to Mastercard as well. We renewed our partnership with Commonwealth Bank of Australia where we will retain exclusivity across their consumer credit and debit portfolios.', ""We signed a long-term partnership with Shinhan Card, the largest issuer in Korea, to solidify our leadership in the country. This relationship spans consumer and commercial card offerings and expands into new services including data analytics. And in Canada, we executed an exclusive long-term renewal of the President's Choice Financial, consumer credit and prepaid portfolios. We're also winning in fintechs, co-brands and public sector partners. When it comes to fintechs, Mastercard is a partner of choice. In fact, Mastercard serves over 80% of the top digital payment and neobank fintechs on the CNBC Global Fintech list. This quarter, Starling Bank, one of the largest fintechs in the UK renewed their partnership with Mastercard. In the co-brand space, we're partnering with J."", ""Crew and Synchrony in the U.S. to launch the retailer's first co-branded digital first card. And in the public sector, we have an exclusive partnership with Fiserv Money Network for all U.S. state and federal government benefit and wage disbursement debit programs. As part of our partnership, we are thrilled to launch with the California Economic Development Department in February, the largest unemployment program in the United States. As you can see, we continue our positive deal momentum powered by our differentiated products and services, while always keeping a focus on financial discipline. This also helps us to capture more of the secular tailwind and in turn further drive services growth. Looking to China, we are thrilled that our joint venture in China has released formal approval to commence domestic bankcard clearing."", ""Believe that we will be uniquely positioned to provide Chinese consumers with an exceptional payment experience using a single card that's optimized for both domestic and cross-border spend. While we're excited about the medium to long-term opportunity, there's still work to be done as we fully build out the issuing and acceptance footprint. As we do that, we continue to grow our presence with bank and fintech partners in the market. ICBC launched the first world Mastercard product in November and Bank of Communications selected Mastercard to launch their first international debit card. Beyond cards, we also continue to make meaningful progress in the account-to-account space. This quarter, we announced a long-term strategic partnership with The Clearing House, the operator of the RTP network, which continues to secure our position in real time payments in the United States."", 'Now shifting gears, we continue to execute against our strategy to capture the large secular opportunity in targeted new flows including commercial payments and disbursements and remittances. We continue to win in commercial. This spans commercial point of sale and B2B accounts payable which we target through our market-leading virtual card solution. This quarter alone we renewed our commercial relationships with JPMorgan and FLEETCOR, two of the largest commercial issuers in the United States. BNP Paribas Fortis will flip their business credit portfolio to Mastercard in Belgium and on the virtual card front, we announced two exciting partnerships in the online travel agency space with Booking.com and Agoda. Turning now to disbursements and remittances.', 'In 2023, we grew transactions by over 30%. We continue to scale our use cases. For example UBS has integrated our cross-border services capability. This will enable them to execute instant cross-border payments from multiple use cases, including helping their customers pay employees abroad. In addition, we also partnered with Alipay to establish them as a cross-border payments receiving institution in China. Payments, services and new networks reinforce each other. We said it countless times. Our services and new networks provide differentiation as noted in many of the wins I mentioned. Underlying payments growth helps drive services too and payments growth brings incremental rich data. Our services turn that data into valuable insights and when implemented by our customers, those insights can drive incremental digitization of payments.', 'In turn, this generates even more data, more transactions, more need for fraud tools and the powerful cycle continues. The services and new networks components of our growth algorithms are built on, driving increased penetration of existing customers, extending our services across new customers and customer types and continuing to build and deploy new services. Here are a few examples how we are executing against each of these. The past year Bank of America has expanded their services relationship with us to include test and learn program management and supplier enablement solutions. This is on top of many of our services they already have. Axis Bank in India has also expanded their relationship with us. They will use our consulting, marketing and analytics services to support end-to-end portfolio lifecycle management.', ""Worldpay is utilizing our fraud alerts to streamline the dispute resolution process. And Citi has deployed consumer clarity digital receipts to provide eligible U.S. cardholders with detailed purchase information directly to their bank app. Now with increased visibility about the merchant and purchase details, consumers can easily validate transactions and reduce the number of disputes they file. Square is also integrating consumer clarity solution. Furthermore, Nexi has chose Mastercard as a strategic partner to rollout open banking for e-commerce payments across Europe and the list goes on. We're extending our services and solutions across new customer types including large marketplaces. Alibaba will use Mastercard's open banking technology to help streamline the onboarding experience for small businesses on the U.S. marketplace and reduce fraud."", ""And Meta utilizes our digital identity technology to improve authentication for online orders. We also continue to develop new services and solutions, many of which leverage the work we are doing with Generative AI. Generative AI brings more opportunity to drive better experiences for our customers, and makes it easier to extract insights from our data. It can also help us increase internal productivity. We're working on many GenAI use cases today to do just that. For example, we recently announced Shopping Muse. Shopping Muse uses Generative AI to offer a conversational shopping tool that recreates the in-store human experience online, can translate consumers' colloquial language into tailored recommendations. Another example is Mastercard Small Business AI."", 'The tool will draw on our existing small business resources along with the content from a newly formed global media coalition to help business owners navigate a range of business challenges. The platform, which is scheduled for pilot launch later this year, will leverage AI to provide personalized real-time assistance delivered in a conversational tone. And finally, we expanded Mastercard Access, which provides customers with a single point of connectivity to quickly and easily source our AI digital and identity services. Using access customers can deploy these services across multiple rails or networks including those outside the Mastercard network. This is an exciting development, which enhances our ability to scale our services across networks and streamlines the ability for our customers to adopt our capabilities.', ""So with that, I will wrap it up. In summary, we delivered another strong quarter and year of revenue and earnings growth. We're successfully executing against our strategy and on our growth algorithm. Our differentiated capabilities, diversified business model and focused strategy position us well to capitalize on the significant opportunity in front of us. Sachin, over to you."", 'Sachin Mehra: Thanks, Michael. Turning now to Page 3, which shows our financial performance for the fourth quarter on a currency-neutral basis, excluding where applicable, special items and the impact of gains and losses on our equity investments. Net revenue was up 11%, reflecting continued growth in our payment network and our value-added services and solutions. Operating expenses increased 9%, including a minimal impact from acquisitions. And operating income was up 13%, including a minimal impact from acquisitions. Net income and EPS increased by 15% and 18%, respectively, both reflecting the strong operating income growth as well as a non-recurring tax benefit recognized in the fourth quarter. EPS was $3.18, which includes an $0.08 contribution from share repurchases.', ""During the quarter, we repurchased $1.8 billion worth of stock and an additional $586 million through January 26, 2024. So let's turn to Page 4, where you can see the operational metrics for the fourth quarter. Worldwide gross dollar volume or GDV increased by 10% year-over-year on a local currency basis. In the U.S., GDV increased by 4% with credit growth of 5% and debit growth of 3%. Outside of the U.S., volume increased 13% with credit growth of 13% and debit growth of 12%. Sequentially, the debit growth rate was primarily impacted by the lapping of the NatWest portfolio migration in the UK. Overall, cross-border volume increased 18% globally for the quarter on a local currency basis, reflecting continued strong growth in both travel and non-travel related cross-border spending."", 'While this is sequentially lower versus Q3, this is primarily due to tougher comps as we continue to lap the cross-border travel recovery from last year. Turning to Page 5. Switched transactions grew 12% year-over-year in Q4, both card-present and card-not-present growth rates remain strong. Card-present growth was aided in part by increases in contactless penetration as contactless now represents approximately 65% of all in-person switched purchase transactions. In addition, card growth was 8%. Globally, there are 3.3 billion Mastercard and Maestro-branded cards issued. Turning to Slide 6 for a look into our net revenues for the fourth quarter discussed on a currency-neutral basis. Payment Network net revenue increased 7%, primarily driven by domestic and cross-border transaction and volume growth and also includes growth in rebates and incentives.', ""Value-added Services & Solutions net revenue increased 17%, primarily driven by strong growth in our Cyber & Intelligence Solutions, driven by the growth in our underlying drivers and the continued scaling of our fraud and security solutions and our identity and authentication solutions. In addition, we saw strong growth in our marketing, data analytics and consulting services as well as our loyalty solutions. This was partially tempered by slower relative growth in our other solutions. Now let's turn to Page 7 to discuss key metrics related to the payment network, again, described on a currency-neutral basis unless otherwise noted. Looking quickly at each metric. Domestic assessments were up 7%, while worldwide GDV grew 10%. The difference is primarily driven by mix."", 'Cross-border assessments increased 21%, while cross-border volumes increased 18%. The 3 ppt difference is primarily due to favorable mix. Transaction processing assessments were up 10%, while switched transactions grew 12%. The 2 ppt difference is primarily due to lower revenues related to FX volatility versus the prior year. Other network assessments were $251 million this quarter. As a reminder, these assessments primarily relate to licensing, implementation and other franchise fees and may fluctuate from period to period. Moving on to Page 8. You can see that on a non-GAAP currency-neutral basis, excluding special items, total adjusted operating expenses increased 9%, which includes a minimal impact from acquisitions. This increase was primarily due to increased spending on personnel to support the continued execution of our strategic initiatives and increased spending on marketing campaigns, advertising and sponsorships like the UEFA Champions League and the Rugby World Cup.', 'Turning to Page 9, you will see that we are no longer providing operating metrics as a percentage of 2019 given that we are well past the pandemic. Now let me comment on the operating metric trends in the fourth quarter and through the first four weeks of January. Starting with switch volume growth year-over-year. The sequential decline from Q3 to Q4 is primarily due to the lapping effects from the routing of all Mastercard branded volume in Japan to the Mastercard switch and the migration of the NatWest portfolio to Mastercard. Specific to the U.S., the sequential decline from Q3 to Q4 was primarily due to tougher comps. Moving to the first four weeks of January, switched volume growth in the U.S. was impacted primarily by severe weather events across the country.', 'As we look specifically at the fourth week of January, which did not have the same impacts from severe weather, switched volume in the U.S. returned to approximately 5% growth year-over-year, similar to what we saw in December. Outside of the U.S., we continue to lap the migration of the NatWest portfolio. Switch transactions follow similar patterns to switched volumes. Looking at cross-border for both Q4 and the first four weeks of January, cross-border travel growth continues to be primarily impacted by tougher comps as we lap the recovery of travel. Cross-border card-not-present ex travel continues to show strength. Turning now to Page 10, I wanted to share our thoughts on fiscal year 2024. Let me start by saying our business fundamentals remain strong.', 'We continue to grow through a combination of healthy consumer spending, new and renewed customer agreements, continued secular shift from cash to card and strong growth across our service offerings. In short, as Michael said, we are executing on our strategy and realizing the benefits from our growth algorithm. Overall, we remain fairly positive about the growth outlook. Consumer spending continues to be supported by a strong labor market and wage growth. Our base case scenario for 2024 reflects healthy consumer spending and recent spending dynamics. That being said, we are closely monitoring both positives and negatives in the macro environment as well as geopolitical events, and we stand ready to manage our investment levels as appropriate while maintaining focus on our key strategic priorities.', 'As it relates to the full-year 2024, our base case is for net revenues to grow at the high end of a low double-digit rate on a currency-neutral basis, excluding acquisitions. Acquisitions and foreign exchange are forecasted to have a minimal impact for the year. In terms of operating expenses, we expect full year growth at the low end of a low double-digit rate on a currency-neutral basis, excluding acquisitions and special items. Of note, this includes an increase of approximately 1 ppt in operating expense due to a new Brazil tax legislation, which went into effect as of January 1, 2024. This legislation results in higher operating expenses due to an increase in indirect taxes, which is more than offset by a reduction in our income taxes expense.', 'Acquisitions and foreign exchange are forecasted to have a minimal impact to this growth rate for the year. Now turning to Q1 2024. Year-over-year net revenue growth is expected to be at the low end of a low double-digit rate on a currency-neutral basis, excluding acquisitions. Acquisitions and foreign exchange are forecasted to have a minimal impact to this growth rate for the quarter. Let me briefly talk through why our full year currency-neutral net revenue growth is expected to be higher than the first quarter of 2024. This is primarily driven by two factors: First, revenues related to FX volatility were highest in Q1 2023 compared to the other quarters in the year. And second, while our value-added services and solutions continue to grow at a healthy pace, from a cadence perspective, we expect Q1 growth to be lower relative to the other quarters, primarily due to tougher comps.', 'From an operating expense standpoint, we expect Q1 operating expense growth to be at the high end of a high single-digit rate versus a year ago, again, on a currency-neutral basis, excluding acquisitions and special items. Once again, this includes an increase of approximately 1 ppt related to the Brazil tax legislation that I mentioned earlier. Acquisitions are forecasted to add 0 to 1 ppt to this OpEx growth and foreign exchange is expected to be a headwind of approximately 0 to 1 ppt for the quarter. Other items to keep in mind. On the other income and expense line, we expect an expense of approximately $60 million to $65 million for Q1, given the prevailing interest rates and debt levels. This excludes gains and losses on our equity investments, which are excluded from our non-GAAP metrics.', 'Finally, we expect a non-GAAP tax rate of 16% to 17% for Q1 and approximately 17% on a full year basis, all based on the current geographic mix of our business. This reflects the benefit to our effective tax rate related to the Brazil tax legislation that I mentioned earlier. And with that, I will turn the call back over to Devin.', 'Devin Corr: Thank you.

The company beat forecasts, with revenue of US$9.9b, some 4.3% above estimates, and statutory earnings per share (EPS) coming in at US$2.46, 25% ahead of expectations. Earnings are an important time for investors, as they can track a company's performance, look at what the analysts are forecasting for next year, and see if there's been a change in sentiment towards the company. We thought readers would find it interesting to see the analysts latest (statutory) post-earnings forecasts for next year."", ' View our latest analysis for QUALCOMM ', ""Taking into account the latest results, the consensus forecast from QUALCOMM's 27 analysts is for revenues of US$38.0b in 2024. This reflects an okay 4.7% improvement in revenue compared to the last 12 months. Statutory earnings per share are predicted to grow 15% to US$8.10. In the lead-up to this report, the analysts had been modelling revenues of US$38.0b and earnings per share (EPS) of US$7.45 in 2024. The analysts seems to have become more bullish on the business, judging by their new earnings per share estimates."", ""The analysts have been lifting their price targets on the back of the earnings upgrade, with the consensus price target rising 5.0% to US$160. That's not the only conclusion we can draw from this data however, as some investors also like to consider the spread in estimates when evaluating analyst price targets. The most optimistic QUALCOMM analyst has a price target of US$180 per share, while the most pessimistic values it at US$120. These price targets show that analysts do have some differing views on the business, but the estimates do not vary enough to suggest to us that some are betting on wild success or utter failure."", ""Looking at the bigger picture now, one of the ways we can make sense of these forecasts is to see how they measure up against both past performance and industry growth estimates. We would highlight that QUALCOMM's revenue growth is expected to slow, with the forecast 6.3% annualised growth rate until the end of 2024 being well below the historical 14% p.a. growth over the last five years. By way of comparison, the other companies in this industry with analyst coverage are forecast to grow their revenue at 16% per year. Factoring in the forecast slowdown in growth, it seems obvious that QUALCOMM is also expected to grow slower than other industry participants."", ""The biggest takeaway for us is the consensus earnings per share upgrade, which suggests a clear improvement in sentiment around QUALCOMM's earnings potential next year. Fortunately, the analysts also reconfirmed their revenue estimates, suggesting that it's tracking in line with expectations. Although our data does suggest that QUALCOMM's revenue is expected to perform worse than the wider industry. We note an upgrade to the price target, suggesting that the analysts believes the intrinsic value of the business is likely to improve over time."", 'Keeping that in mind, we still think that the longer term trajectory of the business is much more important for investors to consider.

GuruFocus has detected 7 Warning Sign with QCOM.', ""On January 31, 2024, Qualcomm Inc (NASDAQ:QCOM) filed its 10-Q report, revealing a financial performance that reflects both the company's resilience and the challenges it faces in a dynamic market. The filing date marks a critical point for investors to understand Qualcomm's current position and future prospects. With revenues climbing to $9.9 billion, a 5% increase from the previous year, and net income surging by 24% to $2.8 billion, Qualcomm demonstrates strong financial health. This SWOT analysis aims to dissect these figures and beyond, providing a comprehensive view of the company's strategic position."", ""Technological Leadership and Patent Portfolio: Qualcomm Inc (NASDAQ:QCOM) stands out for its pioneering role in wireless technology, particularly with its CDMA and OFDMA patents that are essential for 3G, 4G, and 5G networks. The company's intellectual property portfolio is a formidable asset, granting it a competitive advantage in the market. Qualcomm's technological innovations not only drive its licensing business but also underpin its leadership in the wireless chip sector. The firm's Snapdragon processors are synonymous with high performance, powering a vast array of premier handsets and positioning Qualcomm as the go-to supplier for cutting-edge processors."", ""Financial Performance: The company's financial robustness is evident in its latest 10-Q filing, which shows a solid balance sheet with a notable increase in net income. This financial strength provides Qualcomm with the flexibility to invest in research and development, ensuring its continued leadership in wireless technology. The increase in revenues, particularly from the QCT segment, underscores the company's ability to capitalize on market demand, despite the highly competitive environment."", ""Customer Concentration: A significant weakness for Qualcomm Inc (NASDAQ:QCOM) is its reliance on a limited number of customers and licensees for a substantial portion of its revenues. This dependence on a few major players, especially those in the premium handset market, exposes the company to risks associated with any fluctuations in these customers' sales or strategic shifts towards vertical integration. The loss or reduction of business from any key customer could have a material adverse effect on Qualcomm's financial results."", ""Operational Risks: Qualcomm's operational model, which includes a fabless production approach, relies heavily on third-party suppliers for procurement, manufacture, assembly, and testing of its products. While this model offers certain advantages, it also presents risks related to supply chain disruptions, geopolitical conflicts, and natural disasters. Any failure to execute supply strategies effectively could harm the company's business and operational results."", ""Market Expansion: Qualcomm Inc (NASDAQ:QCOM) has significant opportunities to grow its business by extending its technologies into new and expanded product areas beyond mobile handsets. The automotive and Internet of Things (IoT) markets present vast potential for the company's wireless technology and chips. Qualcomm's strategic investments in these sectors could lead to new revenue streams and diversification of its customer base, reducing its reliance on the smartphone market."", ""5G Technology Leadership: As a leader in 5G technology, Qualcomm is well-positioned to capitalize on the global transition to 5G networks. The company's expertise and extensive patent portfolio in this area provide a strong foundation for growth as industries and applications increasingly adopt 5G technology. Qualcomm's ability to drive innovation in 5G will likely result in continued demand for its products and licensing agreements."", ""Geopolitical Tensions: Qualcomm Inc (NASDAQ:QCOM)'s significant business concentration in China poses a threat amid escalating U.S./China trade and national security tensions. Any adverse political actions, such as trade restrictions or inclusion on government entity lists, could limit the company's ability to transact with key Chinese customers or suppliers, potentially impacting its revenues and growth prospects."", ""Intense Competition and Vertical Integration: The semiconductor industry is characterized by fierce competition, and Qualcomm faces the threat of its customers developing their own integrated circuit products. This trend towards vertical integration, particularly among major handset manufacturers, could lead to a reduction in demand for Qualcomm's products, affecting its market share and profitability."", ""In conclusion, Qualcomm Inc (NASDAQ:QCOM) exhibits a strong financial foundation and technological leadership, particularly in the 5G domain. However, the company must navigate the challenges of customer concentration and geopolitical risks, particularly in China.

For defense contracting giant Lockheed Martin (NYSE: LMT), however, it was rather ho-hum."", 'Reporting fourth-quarter (and therefore full-year) results last week, Lockheed Martin was forced to admit that 2023 sales inched up only 2.4% in comparison to 2022, to $67.6 billion. On profit, the news was better. As calculated according to generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), Lockheed earned $6.9 billion, or $27.55 per share, compared with $5.7 billion, or $21.66 per share, in 2022 -- 21% year over year growth, or 27%, depending on how you look at it.', 'But as regards cash flow, and more importantly free cash flow, the news was depressing again. Operating cash flow grew barely 1%, and free cash flow was up less than 2% at $6.2 billion -- and 10% below reported net income, indicating less than stellar quality of earnings.', 'Ho. Hum.', 'Wall Street was most decidedly not impressed with these numbers, and Lockheed Martin stock fell 4% on the day they were announced -- then continued to slide all week long, ending up down more than 6% post-earnings.', ""It probably didn't help that Lockheed's forecast for 2024 wasn't clearly any better than the numbers it put up in 2023. Turning to guidance, Lockheed said it expects to book between $68.5 billion and $70 billion in sales this year -- 3.6% growth in the best-case scenario, and potentially as little as 1.3%. Free cash flow will be flat to down at about $6.2 billion. Profit, meanwhile, will fall to a range of from $25.65 to $26.35 per share, below both actual results for 2023 and analysts' forecasts for 2024."", ""Yes, you read that right: In a bull market for defensive weapons, Lockheed Martin says it's going to earn less money this year than it did last year."", 'Why is this?', 'Demand doesn\'t seem to be the issue. Lockheed CEO Jim Taiclet confirmed the company is seeing ""continued strong demand for our all-domain portfolio of advanced defense tech solutions."" Backlog of orders hit a new record of $160.6 billion at the end of 2023, rising 7% year over year -- nearly three times as fast as sales.', 'It just seems to be taking a little while for that growth to appear. In a post-earnings conference call, company CFO Jay Malave also confirmed that Lockheed\'s book-to-bill ratio was about 1.1 in 2023, supporting the thesis that sales are still growing, although there\'s a ""long cycle nature [to] Lockheed Martin\'s"" defense sales. And with Lockheed\'s revenues already at all-time highs, and government budgets stretched all around the world, there simply may not be a lot of room left to grow no matter how strong the demand is.', ""At the same time, Lockheed Martin's profit margins on its sales look similarly stretched. At 13.4% for the year, they're within a whisker of the 13.6% margin high reached in 2020, suggesting that profit, too, may have nowhere to go but down from this point. Indeed, in comments on the conference call, Malave seemed to be telling analysts to expect 10.5% (possibly net) margin in 2024, rising to not much more than 11%, and not sooner than 2026."", ""Big picture, therefore, here's what I think we're looking at with Lockheed Martin stock. At 15.5 times earnings the stock looks cheap -- especially when compared with an S&P 500 that's selling for nearly 27 times earnings. However, revenue is at historical highs and growth is slowing, while profit margin is near an all-time peak -- and falling."", ""That doesn't sound like a scenario in which investors can count on seeing profit grow much at all from here on out. And indeed, according to a poll conducted by S&P Global Market Intelligence, most analysts are predicting Lockheed's earnings won't grow much faster than 3% annually over the next five years -- barely surpassing the rate of inflation."", ""Even in the midst of what look like they should be a bull market conditions for defense companies, I wouldn't buy Lockheed Martin stock today."", 'Should you invest $1,000 in Lockheed Martin right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Lockheed Martin, consider this:', ""The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Lockheed Martin wasn't one of them.

One common approach is to try and find a company with returns on capital employed (ROCE) that are increasing, in conjunction with a growing amount of capital employed. This shows us that it's a compounding machine, able to continually reinvest its earnings back into the business and generate higher returns. Having said that, while the ROCE is currently high for Lockheed Martin (NYSE:LMT), we aren't jumping out of our chairs because returns are decreasing."", ""If you haven't worked with ROCE before, it measures the 'return' (pre-tax profit) a company generates from capital employed in its business.

If you're interested, you can view the analysts predictions in our free report on analyst forecasts for the company."", ""There hasn't been much to report for Lockheed Martin's returns and its level of capital employed because both metrics have been steady for the past five years. Businesses with these traits tend to be mature and steady operations because they're past the growth phase. Although current returns are high, we'd need more evidence of underlying growth for it to look like a multi-bagger going forward. This probably explains why Lockheed Martin is paying out 50% of its income to shareholders in the form of dividends. Unless businesses have highly compelling growth opportunities, they'll typically return some money to shareholders."", ""While Lockheed Martin has impressive profitability from its capital, it isn't increasing that amount of capital. Although the market must be expecting these trends to improve because the stock has gained 63% over the last five years. However, unless these underlying trends turn more positive, we wouldn't get our hopes up too high."", ""Like most companies, Lockheed Martin does come with some risks, and we've found 1 warning sign  that you should be aware of."", 'High returns are a key ingredient to strong performance, so check out our free list ofstocks earning high returns on equity with solid balance sheets.', 'Have feedback on this article?

You can skip our detailed analysis on this critical naval vessel and head over directly to the 5 Navies with the Most Submarines in the World.', 'Assessing the strength of a military requires a thorough scrutiny of the sophistication of its weaponry. There is great emphasis on submarines in modern warfare due to the crucial role these submersible vessels play underwater in both covert operations and offensive roles against adversaries. These watercrafts are an integral component in the arsenal of leading naval forces across the world.\xa0', 'While the United States undisputedly has the most powerful military in the world, it surprisingly is not on top spot when it comes to the fleet size of submarines. This, however, does not imply any deficiency in the realm because most of its submarines are of premium quality, powered with nuclear technology in contrast to a majority of other countries that are in the race.', 'The Virginia class is the latest class of submarines operated by the United States Navy. The nuclear-powered attack submersible first joined the Navy in 1998. Designed by General Dynamics Corporation (NYSE:GD)’s subsidiary, General Dynamics Electric Boat (GDEB), and Huntington Ingalls Industries, Inc. (NYSE:HII), the Virginia class offers multiple capabilities to the Navy, such as reconnaissance, land attack, anti-shipping, and special operations. According to a Congressional Research Service report in April 2019, the Virginia class costs between $2.8 to $3.2 billion per unit.', 'Australia is likely to become the second country after the United States to operate the Virginia class of submarines, as the US Navy plans on selling the used nuclear submarines to Australia under the AUKUS pact in 2032 and 2035. The monetary aspects of the agreement are not known. Australia’s Babcock International, which provides infrastructure in Adelaide and Perth for nuclear powered submarines, has already entered into a strategic partnership with Huntington Ingalls Industries, Inc. (NYSE:HII) to ‘provide critical capability requirements’ for the submarine program.', 'Another fast-attack, nuclear powered submarine operated by the US is the Seawolf class, which was developed during the 1980s to regain the Navy’s technological superiority over Soviet vessels. The submarine is nearly impossible to locate when it is cruising at 20 knots, and is ten times quicker than the Los Angeles class it succeeded. The Seawolf class was also built by General Dynamics Corporation (NYSE:GD).', 'The US Navy is also working on Columbia-class, its upcoming nuclear powered ballistic missile submarine, which is scheduled to enter service in 2031. The development work for the project started in October 2020, with General Dynamics Corporation (NYSE:GD) being chosen as the primary contractor and design lead, while Huntington Ingalls Industries, Inc. (NYSE:HII) serving as the primary contractor.\xa0', 'In 2020, it was reported that Lockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE:LMT) would provide fleet support for the strategic weapon system Trident for the Columbia-class submarine program. The US Navy last year in September marked the successful test launch of Trident II D5 Life Extension Fleet Ballistic Missile (FBM) from the Pacific Ocean. Jerry Mamrol, the VP of Lockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE:LMT)’s Fleet Ballistic Missiles, said on the occasion that his company was proud of the decades long partnership with the Navy, and looks forward to modernizing the missile for use in the Columbia-class of submarines. The D5 missile built by Lockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE:LMT) is one of the most advanced ballistic missiles in the world, with a nominal range of 4,000 nautical miles. It is currently used by the UK’s Vanguard-class and the US’s Ohio-class of submarines.', ""Other prominent submarines currently in operation include the United Kingdom's Astute-class, four of which are currently in service of the Royal Navy, and Russia's Graney-class and Sierra II-class submarines, with the former being the country's latest nuclear attack submarine that succeeded the Akula-class in 2013."", 'Copyright: 1971yes / 123RF Stock Photo', 'Navies with the most submarines in the world are ranked in ascending order of the fleet size of their submarines.

These risk factors and other key information are detailed in our SEC filings, including our annual and quarterly reports. Now, let me turn the call over to Ryan. Ryan?', ""Ryan Marshall: Thanks, Jim, and good morning. I'm excited to speak with you today about PulteGroup's outstanding fourth quarter and full-year financial results. Over the past few years, we have faced macro challenges ranging from COVID, to supply chain disruptions, to skyrocketing mortgage rates. Through it all, we've remained disciplined and consistent in running our operations, but when needed, have quickly adjusted key business practices to position PulteGroup for ongoing success. The benefits of this approach can be seen in the strength of our reported results. Bob will detail our Q4 performance, so let me highlight several of our key operating and financial achievements for the full year of 2023. By strategically increasing our spec production, we had more inventory available to meet the demand of first time home buyers and those consumers worried about mortgage rate volatility."", 'Increased house inventory was a critical support to PulteGroup delivering 28,600 homes in 2023, and record home sale revenues of $15.6 billion. In the face of increased costs for land, labor, and materials, we carefully managed product offerings, pricing, incentives, and absorption paces to maintain high profitability, while ensuring we continue to turn our assets. The result, we reported outstanding full-year gross margins of 29.3%, which helped drive a 6% increase in earnings per share to a record $11.72 per share, and a 27% return on equity. We also continue to efficiently increase our land pipeline as we completed transactions to put approximately 40,000 new lots under control. Inclusive of these lots, 53% of our total land pipeline is under option, either with the land sellers or through our expanding land banking structures.', 'Since making the decision to expand our use of land banking starting 15 months ago, we have placed approximately 25 communities representing $1.5 billion worth of future land and development spend into such structures. And finally, consistent with our stated capital allocation priorities, we invested $4.3 billion into the business through land acquisition and development spend in 2023, and returned $1.2 billion to investors through share repurchases, dividends, and debt paydown. Inclusive of our 2023 spend, we have repurchased almost half of the 2013 shares outstanding since initiating the program over a decade ago. By remaining consistent in our business practices and making market-responsive adjustments were needed, we reported another year of exceptional financial results.', 'I want to thank the entire PulteGroup team for their tireless efforts and support in delivering superior homes and experiences to our home buyers, while providing outstanding financial returns to our investors. Consistent with the broader housing market, we saw homebuying demand being negatively impacted during the early part of the fourth quarter, as 30-year mortgage rates increase toward their 2023 peak of 8%. We then saw buyer sentiment and demand improved, as mortgage rates finally rolled over, ultimately dropping more than 100 basis points as we moved through November and December. The decline in rates helped drive our December net new orders and absorption pace to be the highest month in the quarter. The increased homebuying activity in December was an important driver of the 57% increase in our Q4 net new orders, and demonstrates the desire for home ownership remains high across all buyer groups.', 'It remains our view that the long-term outlook for new home construction is extremely positive. A structural shortage of housing caused by years of underbuilding has only been exacerbated by a lack of resale inventory as owners are financially and/or emotionally locked into their low rate mortgages. While the lack of existing home inventory will resolve itself over time, we believe that land entitlement and labor availability challenges mean it will be difficult to correct for the many years of underbuilding in this country. Given our constructive views on the outlook for housing demand, we are investing in our operations, with the goal of growing unit volumes by 5% to 10% annually. Our decision to walk away from option locks as interest rates increased in 2022, will impact our community openings in 2024, leading to our growth this year being closer to the lower end of this range, as we expect closings of approximately 30,000 homes in 2024.', ""For those of you who have followed PulteGroup’s story for the past few years, you know it's never been about growth for growth's sake. Our focus is always on investing in our business to build shareholder value. So, our objective is to grow our volumes while maintaining high returns on equity. To accomplish this, we must continue to intelligently invest in high quality and high returning projects, while continuing to invest in our own assets through the ongoing repurchase of our stock. As we have demonstrated for much of the past decade, we expect to continue to generate strong cash flows that will allow us to fund our business investment, pay our dividend, and return excess capital to our shareholders, all while maintaining our balance sheet strength and flexibility."", ""Our expectation of continued financial success is reflected in this morning's announcement that our board approved a $1.5 billion increase to our share repurchase authorization. With many forecasting interest rates to fall, the economy to stay relatively healthy, and conditions in the job market to remain favorable, there are certainly reasons to be optimistic about housing demand in the coming years. Let me now turn over the call to Bob for a review of our fourth quarter results. Bob?"", ""Bob O’Shaughnessy: Thanks, Ryan. Good morning. As Ryan mentioned in his comments, market conditions changed meaningfully as the fourth quarter progressed and as mortgage rates began to fall. Our reported financial results for the period were influenced by these evolving market dynamics, so I'll note any important areas of impact in my prepared remarks. Wholesale revenues in the fourth quarter were $4.2 billion, compared with $5 billion in the prior year. Our lower home sale revenues for the period primarily reflect a 14% decrease in closings to 7,615 homes, along with a 2% decrease in our average sales price to $547,000. I would highlight that our fourth quarter closings came in about 5% below our previous guide, as sales early in the quarter were negatively impacted by higher mortgage rates and the general softening in overall buyer demand."", ""As Ryan noted, homebuying demand accelerated in the back half of the quarter, but sales, particularly sales of finished spec homes that would close in the quarter, finished below our assumptions. We could have captured incremental sales and closing value by offering higher incentives, but we didn't see that as a worthwhile tradeoff. Given that buyer trends have remained positive in January, I think we made the right choices as we have inventory available to meet the stronger demand. Our mix of closings in the quarter were comprised 40% first time, 36% move-up, and 24% active adult, which is in alignment with our stated goal for the buyer mix for our business. In the fourth quarter of 2022, closings were 36% first time, 39% move-up, and 25% active adult."", ""Our average community count for the fourth quarter was 919, which represents an 8% increase over last year's fourth quarter average of 850 communities, and was in line with our prior guidance. Looking at order activity in the quarter, our net new orders increased 57% over last year to 6,214 homes. The large increase over last year reflects both improved demand in 2023, as well as the extremely difficult operating environment in the fourth quarter of 2022. As discussed previously, demand conditions grew increasingly difficult early in the fourth quarter this year as mortgage rates climbed to 8%, but we experienced a notable improvement in buying activity as rates decreased over the back half of the quarter. On a sequential basis, our absorption pace improved from November to December, and we would attribute much of this improvement to the decline in interest rates."", 'Along with stronger demand conditions, the year-over-year increase in fourth quarter net new orders benefited from a decrease in cancellation rates. In the most recent quarter, cancellations as a percentage of beginning period backlog fell to 9%, down from 11% in the comparable prior year period. Looking at our order activity by buyer group, fourth quarter net new orders increased 70% for first time buyers, 78% for move-up buyers, and 15% for active adult buyers. Our order numbers indicate that demand improved across all buyer groups, which is a very positive dynamic when assessing potential housing demand in 2024. As a result of our sales and closing activity, our quarter end backlog was 12,146 homes, which is effectively flat with last year.', 'Reflective of the increased mix of first-time buyers and their lower average sales prices, our ending backlog value declined slightly to $7.3 billion. Inclusive of the 7,128 homes we started in the fourth quarter, we ended the year with 16,889 homes in production. 44% of our production is spec, including 1,263 finished specs, which puts us in a strong position to meet buyer demand as we head into the spring selling season. By the end of the fourth quarter, our construction cycle time was down to 130 days, which is a sequential improvement of about two weeks from the end of the third quarter. Going forward, we continue to target getting our cycle time down to 100 days or below by the end of the year. Based on our production pipeline, we expect closings in the first quarter of 2024 to be between 6,200 and 6,600 homes.', 'And given our units under production, we expect full-year deliveries to grow by 5% to 30,000 homes. We currently expect the average sales price of closings to remain in the range of $540 million to $550,000 for the first quarter and the full year of 2024, which is consistent with our fourth quarter pricing. At the midpoint, this would imply price stability over the course of the year. Our fourth quarter gross margin was 28.9%, which is down approximately 50 basis points from both the fourth quarter of last year and the third quarter of this year, but likely remains the industry leader among the big builders. As with the entire year, our fourth quarter margins reflect higher incentive and input costs. Incentives, which primarily impact revenues, increased 50 basis points sequentially from the third quarter to 6.5%.', 'On the cost side, lower lumber prices offset inflation and other material and labor, but higher land and land development costs impacted margins in the period. Given my prior comments that we expect pricing to be flat in 2024, we anticipate that land and house cost inflation will result in gross margins to be in the range of 28% to 28.5% for each quarter during the year. We reported fourth quarter SG&A expense of $308 billion, or 7.4% of home sale revenues, compared with prior year SG&A expense of $351 million, or 7.1%. The 30-basis point drop in overhead leverage can be attributed to the lower closings and revenues realized in the quarter versus the prior year. It should be noted that we recorded $65 billion of pre-tax insurance benefit in the fourth quarters of both 2023 and 2022.', 'Based on anticipated closing volumes, we expect SG&A expense for the full year of 2024 to be in the range of 9.2% to 9.5% of home sale revenues. Given our typical seasonality of closings, we expect SG&A expense in the first quarter to be approximately 10% of home sale revenues, with overhead leverage improving as we move through the remaining quarters of the year. For the fourth quarter, our financial services operations reported pre-tax income of $44 million, which is up from $24 million last year. The improvement in pre-tax income reflects more favorable market conditions across our financial services platform, coupled with higher capture rates, including an increase to 85%, up from 75% last year in our mortgage operations. Our reported pre-tax income for the most recent quarter was $947, million compared with prior year pre-tax income of $1.2 billion.', 'In the period, we recorded tax expense of $236 million for an effective tax rate of 24.9%. Projecting ahead to 2024, we expect our full-year tax rate to be in the range of 24% to 24.5%. Looking at the bottom line, our reported fourth quarter results showed net income of $711 million or $3.28 per share. In the comparable prior year period, we reported net income of $882 million, or $3.85 per share. For the full year of 2023, we reported net income of $2.6 billion and a record earnings of $11.72 per share. Reflective of our strong operating results, in 2023 we generated cash flows from operations of $2.2 billion. Given our current expectations for operating and financial results, along with our plans to increase land investment to $5 billion in the coming year, we expect 2024 cash flows from operations to be approximately $1.8 billion.', ""Turning to our investment and capital allocation activities, we invested $1.3 billion in land acquisition and development in the fourth quarter, of which 59% was for development of our existing land assets. For the year, our land investment totaled $4.3 billion, of which 59% was for development. Given our constructive views on near and longer term housing dynamics, as noted, our plan is to increase our land spend to approximately $5 billion in 2024. We would again anticipate a roughly 60/40 split between development and land acquisition. This increase in investment is consistent with Ryan's earlier comments regarding positioning the business to routinely grow future delivery volumes by 5% to 10% per year. Inclusive of our fourth quarter investments, we ended 2023 with 223,000 lots under control, which is an increase of 5% over the prior year."", ""I would highlight that on a year-over-year basis, we lowered our owned lot count by 4,000 lots, while increasing our lots under option by roughly 16,000 lots. As a result, our percentage of lots under option increased to 53%, up from 48% last year. There's still a lot of runway ahead of us to achieve our goal of 70% option lots, but we're moving in the right direction. Based on the investments we've made and our anticipated community openings and closings in 2024, we expect our average community count in 2024 to be up 3% to 5% in each quarter as compared to the comparable prior year period. Consistent with our stated capital allocation priorities, we continue to return capital to shareholders in 2023. To that end, we paid out $142 million in dividends, and have increased our dividend per share by 25%, starting in the first quarter of 2024."", ""We also repurchased 13.8 billion common shares at a cost of $1 billion for an average price of $72.50 per share, which included $300 million of repurchases at an average price of $83.03 per share in the fourth quarter. With the 13.8 billion shares acquired in 2023, we have repurchased approximately half of the shares outstanding at the time we initiated the program back in 2013. Having repurchased these shares at an average cost of $32.16 per share, we believe it's been a great investment for our shareholders. In addition to buying our stock, in the fourth quarter we took advantage of market conditions by using $35 billion of cash on hand to pay down a portion of our debt. For all of 2023, we retired $101 million of our 2026 and 2027 senior notes through open market transactions, helping to lower our quarter end debt to capital ratio to 15.9%, down 280 basis points from last year."", 'Adjusting for the $1.8 billion of cash on our balance sheet, we ended the year with a net debt to capital ratio of 1.1%. Now, let me turn the call back to Ryan for some final comments.', 'Ryan Marshall: Thanks, Bob. Successfully navigating our business through the past 12 months of rising interest rates has been challenging. The same could be said about the past 24, 36, and 48-month periods as we battled through COVID and the global collapse in supply chains. I am extremely proud of how our entire team responded to these events and the exceptional operating and financial results PulteGroup has delivered over an unprecedented period. Looking back over the five-year period of 2019 to the just recently completed 2023, we grew volumes 5% annually and delivered just under 135,000 homes. To support our growth during this period and for future years, we invested almost $19 billion in cumulative land acquisition and development spend.', ""Through our disciplined land investment, operational focus, and organizational expertise, we capitalized on market conditions to grow earnings per share over this period at a compounded annual growth rate of 34%, while delivering an average annual return on equity of just over 26%. It's this type of strong financial performance during an extended period of market volatility that has prompted increased discussion about the need to reconsider how the large homebuilders are valued. I think that if you want to be valued differently, you must demonstrate a fundamental change in how you operate the business and the results you deliver, not just for a year or two, but over an extended period of time. What's different about the past five years is that while investing $19 billion into our operation, we also generated almost $7 billion in net cash flow from operations during the sustained period of growth."", ""In fact, we recorded only one year of negative cash flow from operations since shifting our focus in 2012 from just topline growth, to driving high returns over the housing cycle. We paid off $1.1 billion of debt, while cutting our leverage by more than half, to end 2023 with a debt to capital ratio of 15.9%, and a net debt to capital ratio of 1.1%. And we returned $4 billion to shareholders through stock repurchases and dividends. I'd add that the reality is, we've been operating our business in just this way for really the past 10 years. I know stocks reflect performance, so I believe that if we can continue to both grow our business and deliver ROE that remains among the industry leaders, while generating positive cash flow and maintaining a low risk profile, that our stock price and shareholders will ultimately be rewarded."", 'Let me now turn the call back to Jim Zeumer.', ""Jim Zeumer: Great.

Thank you for joining us today as we review our results for calendar year 2023. First, I'd like to introduce the members of our management team, who are here with me today. We have Scott Lauber, our President and Chief Executive; Xia Liu, our Chief Financial Officer; and Beth Straka, Senior Vice President of Corporate Communications and Investor Relations.Now as you saw from our news release this morning, we reported full year 2023 adjusted earnings of $4.63 a share. This excludes a onetime noncash charge of $0.41 a share. You may recall that the Illinois Commerce Commission, in November, disallowed the construction costs for the modern service centers and facilities that we built in Illinois to improve employee safety and productivity. We firmly believe that the investments were necessary and prudent. And at the appropriate time, we will appeal the decision in court. Despite the setback in Illinois, I'm pleased to report that we delivered another year of solid results on virtually every meaningful measure from customer satisfaction, to financial performance, to steady execution of our capital plan. Xia will provide you with more detail on our financial metrics for 2023 in just a few moments. Turning to other regulatory matters. The Wisconsin Commission approved our limited reopener filings in December. New rates are now in effect for all of our Wisconsin utilities. And in Illinois, a limited rehearing has been scheduled for a portion of our Safety Modernization Program. As a reminder, the Illinois Commerce Commission ordered a pause in that program for at least 1 year. We've been systematically replacing old leaking cast iron pipes under the streets of Chicago. This long-running project is approximately 38% complete today. We had planned to invest approximately $265 million in these safety upgrades during 2024. Given the commission's order, we will not be carrying out the program as envisioned. We honestly do not believe that stopping the work is in the best interest of our Chicago customers. But we will have another opportunity to make our case in the coming months through this limited rehearing. In addition, the Illinois Commission will open a new docket this month to examine the Future of Gas across the state of Illinois. This review is expected to take at least 1 year to complete.Switching gears now. Let's look at the investment needs of our broader enterprise. We continue to refine our ESG progress plan, our road map, if you will, for the period 2024 through 2028. As you'd expect, we're lowering our planned capital investment in Illinois. But the bigger picture is strong and growing.And today, we're increasing our 5-year plan by $300 million. What was a $23.4 billion plan, the largest in our company's history, is now a 5-year plan totaling $23.7 billion. The increase is focused on 2 categories, electric distribution to support the strong economic growth we're seeing in Wisconsin and WEC Energy's projects that are in our due diligence pipeline. That's our WEC infrastructure projects. In fact, we're in the final stage now of getting another major project for our infrastructure portfolio, a 300-megawatt solar investment for approximately $460 million. Closing and commercial operation could take place in the second quarter of this year. We'll keep you informed. Overall, the building blocks of our updated capital plan clearly support our long-term growth rate. Growth from our 5-year plan on a compound average annual basis remains in the 6.5% to 7% range. As always, we're starting with the midpoint of our 2023 guidance.However, we expect earnings for 2024 to come in at or below the current consensus estimate. The reason is simple, as we redeploy capital, at least temporarily away from Illinois, the majority of the quality projects we're investing in will not be in service for the full year 2024. So for this year, for 2024, we project earnings to be in the range of $4.80 to $4.90 a share, and Xia will provide you with more detail in just a moment or 2. One final but important point about our capital plan. As a percentage of the total enterprise, our regulated Electric business will be larger 5 years from now than it is today. Economic development, reliability and decarbonization are driving that growth. We plan to continue our investment in the infrastructure segment as well. But 5 years from now, we expect the Infrastructure segment will be only 6% of our asset base. And now turning to the regional economy. The unemployment rate in Wisconsin stands at 3.3%. That continues a long-running trend below the national average. And as we've discussed, we're seeing some really exciting developments here in the state. You've heard about Microsoft's plans in the Wisconsin Innovation Park south of Milwaukee. That investment continues to build. Microsoft has now purchased a total of 1,345 acres of property and construction is already underway on a major data center complex. Of course, Microsoft didn't alone, in what we call the I-94 Corridor, companies like HARIBO and Uline are expanding their footprints as well. For example, Uline just announced plans for a third office building in Pleasant Prairie. Uline expects to complete construction by 2025, creating additional space for more than 700 workers. Uline, in case you're not familiar with the name, is the leading distributor of shipping, industrial and packaging materials to businesses throughout North America. And just last week, WestRock, a Fortune200 company that produces sustainable paper and packaging materials, announced plans to build a 587,000 square foot manufacturing facility on the former site of our Pleasant Prairie Power Plant. These developments highlight the strength and the potential of the Wisconsin economy and underscore the need for the investments we're outlining in our 5-year ESG progress plan.And with that, I'll turn the call over to Scott for more specifics on our regulatory calendar, our capital plan and our operational highlights. Scott, all yours."", 'Scott J. Lauber', ""Thank you, Gale. I'd like to start with some more updates on the regulatory front. First, let's review where we stand after the Wisconsin Public Service Commission's written orders this past December. The reopener filings address recovery of capital investments for certain projects going into service in 2023 and also this year. These are renewable facilities, RICE generation and LNG reliability investments. The return on equity and the equity layer were not up for consideration as part of this proceeding. In the coming months, we plan to file a new rate review in Wisconsin for test years 2025 and 2026. You heard from Gale on the latest developments in Illinois. The commission has granted us a limited rehearing focused on our request to rescore $134 million of Safety Modernization Program in 2024. This mostly relates to emergency work, work that is in progress and work driven by public entities like the city of Chicago. We expect the commission to issue an order by June 1.Now turning to our updated capital plan. We have identified $300 million of additional capital investment compared to the initial version of our 5-year plan. I'll walk you through the changes, which are summarized for your reference in the slides we provided for today's call. Most notably, we have included several new investments in our Energy Infrastructure portfolio. We're continuing to take advantage of production tax credits under the Inflation Reduction Act, while providing solid returns through long-term offtake agreements. We expect these projects to add approximately $800 million to our plant, and we're already on our way. Just last month, we closed on an incremental 10% ownership of the Samson Solar Farm, now in operation in Northern Texas. We now own 90% of the farm for a total investment of $280 million. And as Gale mentioned, we have another major project, solar project in their sites. We also plan to increase investment in Wisconsin by $300 million to better support economic development and reliability in the state. Offsetting these incremental investments, you will see an $800 million decrease in our planned spending on the Illinois Gas Delivery system over the 5-year period. This is driven by the regulatory order we received in November. Meanwhile, we're making good progress on a number of regulated projects in support of affordable, reliable and clean energy. We continue to work toward our ambitious goal for reducing greenhouse gas emissions. At the end of 2023, we achieved a 54% reduction in carbon emissions from electric generation, compared to 2005. That puts us well on our way toward an 80% reduction in target by the end of 2030, as we build our portfolio of low and no carbon generation.And the progress continues. The final panels of the Badger Hollow Solar Park are now in service, completing the largest solar project in Wisconsin's history. As you'll recall, our Wisconsin utilities own a total of 200 megawatts of solar capacity at Badger Hollow. The facility's first phase went online in December 2021 and the second phase wrapped up at the end of 2023. In addition, our Bluff Creek LNG storage facility is now in service. Liquefied natural gas provides a solution to meet peak customer demand for heating as well as gas supply needed for power generation. This storage will be necessary during extreme weather events, like we experienced in mid-January. I'm also pleased to announce that we have been using renewable natural gas in our distribution system. This replaces a portion of the traditional natural gas we deliver to customers, while contributing to our methane reduction goal. Our latest pilot project with EPRI and CMBlu Energy is also underway. And as you'll recall, this is testing a long-duration battery made with environmentally friendly materials. We look forward to sharing the results across the industry later this year. It's a strong start to the year. Our capital plan is robust and highly executable and we continue to focus on the fundamentals of the business. With that, I'll turn things back to Gale."", 'Gale E. Klappa', ""Scott, thank you very much. Now as you may have seen, our Board at this January meeting raised the quarterly dividend to $0.835 a share. That's an increase of $0.055 a share or 7%. This will mark the 21st consecutive year that our shareholders will be rewarded with higher dividends. The increase is consistent with our policy of paying out 65% to 70% of our earnings in dividends and underscores our confidence in delivering a bright, sustainable future. One other quick note on our track record of dividend growth. We learned last week that WEC Energy is being added to S&P's High Dividend Aristocrats Index. This index is made up exclusively of companies that have raised their dividends for at least 20 consecutive years.Next up, Xia will provide you with more detail on our financial results, our financing plan and our 2024 guidance. Xia?"", 'Xia Liu', ""Thanks, Gale. Turning now to earnings. Excluding the $0.41 per share noncash impairment charge in Illinois, our 2023 adjusted earnings per share were $4.63. Our earnings package includes a year-over-year comparison of results on Page 16. I'll walk through the significant drivers. Starting with our utility operations. Weather had an estimated $0.24 negative impact year-over-year. In fact, January, February and December of 2023 were the warmest on record, over the past 133 years. Higher depreciation and amortization expense and interest expense added another $0.33 of negative variance. These unfavorable variances were more than offset during the year. Rate-based growth contributed $0.75 of positive variance year-over-year. This includes the base rate increase for our Wisconsin and Minnesota utilities, as well as the rate increase for Peoples Gas that was effective December 1, 2023. Additionally, fuel expense improved our earnings by $0.14. Lower day-to-day O&M resulted in a $0.10 improvement and taxes and other items benefited earnings by $0.04. Remember, we originally guided our 2023 total company day-to-day O&M to be 3% to 5% higher than 2022. Throughout the year, we were able to manage to a much tighter range. Our actual 2023 total company day-to-day O&M was only 0.6% higher than 2022. Turning now to Sales. You'll see the details on Page 12 of the earnings package. On a weather-normal basis, retail electric deliveries in Wisconsin, excluding the iron ore mine, were down 1% in 2023. The decrease was driven by our large commercial and industrial sales, which were down 3.3%. Meanwhile, Residential and Small Commercial and Industrial sales increased 0.2%, which were ahead of our forecast. Our sales projections for 2024 can be found on Pages 12 and 13 of the earnings package. Overall, we're projecting relatively flat Electric sales year-over-year and 0.8% growth in Gas sales year-over-year. Regarding our investment in American Transmission Company, earnings decreased $0.03 compared to 2022. Recall that last year, we reported a $0.05 pickup from a resolution of MISO ROE appeals. This was partially offset by a $0.02 improvement in earnings related to additional capital investment. Earnings at our Energy Infrastructure segment improved $0.04 in '23, compared to 2022. This was mainly driven by an increase in production tax credits. Finally, you'll see that earnings at our Corporate and other segment decreased $0.29, primarily driven by an increase in interest expense. Overall, we improved our performance by $0.18 per share on an adjusted basis in 2023.Now Gale and Scott have laid out our refreshed 5-year capital plan. In light of the $300 million increase to our capital plan, we have revised our funding plan accordingly. Consistent with our previous message, we're funding this increase with an even split between debt and equity. As you can see on Page 21 of the earnings package, we now expect to issue between $1.95 billion and $2.35 billion of common equity over the next 5 years. As you can see on the chart, over the next 5 years, we expect cash from operations to fund about 64% of our cash needs. About 28% of the funding is expected to come from debt and the remaining 8% from issuance of common equity. We have turned on new equity to satisfy the dividend reinvestment and employee benefit plans, and we also expect to use at-the-market programs. Our common equity issuance is still projected to be in the range of $100 million to $200 million for 2024. Post 2024, our equity issuances will be tied to our capital plan, ratably at approximately $500 million a year.Finally, let's look at our earnings guidance. As Gale stated, for the full year 2024, we're providing guidance of $4.80 to $4.90 per share. In developing this guidance range, we took into consideration the expected loss of earnings from lower rate base in Illinois and timing of several projects under development. Now let me briefly discuss our day-to-day nonfuel O&M expense expectations. We expect our 2024 O&M to be 6% to 7% higher. Approximately 5% of the increase is driven by assets that were included in recent rate cases, projects in the Infrastructure segment and extraordinary storm costs in January. The remaining O&M increase of 1% to 2% is largely driven by inflation, offset by operating efficiencies. Looking at the bigger picture, our O&M projection for 2024 is well below our actual O&M expenditures 8 years ago in 2016. In terms of first quarter 2024 earnings guidance, we project to earn in the range of $1.96 per share to $2 per share. This forecast takes into account January weather and assumes normal weather for the rest of the quarter. Recall that we earned $1.61 per share in the first quarter last year. There are a couple of main drivers for the quarter. One, weather was unfavorable by $0.10 in Q1 last year. Of course, we're assuming normal weather for the remainder of the quarter this year. Two, with the rate design changes at Peoples Gas, under the latest commission order, we now expect base revenues will be concentrated in the first and fourth quarter heating months, when natural gas usage is the highest. Correspondingly, we expect lower contributions from Peoples Gas in Q2 and Q3. We'll provide you with more details as the year progresses. As a reminder, however, in Illinois, we have a decoupling mechanism in place that mitigates the weather impact. With that, I'll turn it back to Gale."", 'Gale E. Klappa', ""Xia, thank you very much. Operator, we're ready now for the question-and-answer portion of the call."", 'Operator', '(Operator Instructions) And it looks like your first question comes from the line of Shar Pourreza with Guggenheim Partners.', 'Shahriar Pourreza', ""Gale, just a quick one on -- so the $4.80 to $4.90 guidance for '24, I mean, that's obviously about 5.4% growth year-over-year. And you obviously have a very tight EPS growth range and the divid this year is clearly from the CapEx timing. As we kind of bridge into '25, let's just say, can you kind of grow at that top end or above the EPS growth range to keep you within the 6.5% to 7% target? Or should we assume kind of bottom end in the near term and a step-up in the back half, given the pace at which you may not be able to deploy capital?"", 'Gale E. Klappa', ""Well, great question, Shar. Let me say this. We have a lot of levers and a lot of great opportunities. And so it's probably too early to say exactly where in the 2025 range we might land, but we're pretty optimistic about the levers and the opportunities that we have in 2024, of course, as we redeploy, as I mentioned in the script, as we redeploy in -- away from Illinois and into quality projects, timing is really the driver here.But let me just say this, if we were able to make the top end of our 2024 guidance, $4.90, we would have recovered virtually the entire hit from the Illinois rate order. So that might help put things in perspective for 2024. And then we will work on '25 and beyond. But again, we -- I mean, just with what we're seeing here on the ground, we have tremendous opportunity for appropriate investments that will drive growth."", 'Shahriar Pourreza', 'Okay. Got it. Perfect. And then just Gale on the $800 million reduction in Illinois, was that all related to S&P, and what was the amount that was above that? And then just that concurrent shift into sort of the infrastructure segment? I guess, can you just talk about the profile of that spend and whether sort of there any earnings accretive opportunities from this shuffle, especially since you do target returns on an adjusted basis anyway for the infrastructure segment, that is higher than the regulated side?', 'Gale E. Klappa', ""Yes. We do. We target returns on the Infrastructure segment slightly higher than the regulated piece of the business. But to answer your first question, virtually all of the $800 million reduction that you're seeing, as we allocate capital in our various business segments -- virtually all of that $800 million reduction in Illinois is an assumption because we just don't know what S&P spending is going to look like going forward. So that's virtually all related to the cessation of work."", 'Shahriar Pourreza', ""Okay. Got it. Okay. Perfect. And then just lastly for me. It's just -- obviously, the S&P program -- obviously, there's a new docket out there and there's an investigation, but there was sort of this independent engineering study that was recently conducted by the commission that already sort of proved out that the S&P needed to be carried out. How does that kind of play into this new docket?"", 'Gale E. Klappa', ""Yes, Shar, great memory. Shar, it is exactly correct. A number of years ago, 2017, 2018 time frame, the Illinois Commission ordered us to bring in a highly recognized outside engineering firm, an independent engineering firm, to assess the condition of, particularly, the cast iron and ductile iron pipes under Chicago. Remember, we started out on this program, there were 2,000 miles of iron pipes that we believe needed to be replaced. It's called the Kiefner study, K-I-E-F-N-E-R. It's on file with the commission itself, if anyone wants to take a look at it. But long story short, that Kiefner study, which was delivered to the commission in January of 2020, concluded something pretty stark. The conclusion was that more than 80% of the remaining iron pipes under Chicago have a remaining useful life of less than 15 years. That material was reintroduced in our rate case this past fall. It was dismissed by the intervenors as old data. And I guess my only comment on that is the pipes aren't getting any younger, and the corrosion keeps on coming. So we think there's really a solid basis from the standpoint of safety and from the continuing call from the Federal Pipeline Safety Administration to accelerate the replacement of these pipes. But you got a great memory, that study is on record and very supportive of the need to continue for safety reasons, the work we've had underway."", 'Operator', 'And our next question comes from the line of Neil Kalton with Wells Fargo Securities.', 'Neil Andrew Kalton', ""So a quick question on the -- sort of following up on the initial questions on the S&P program. If that were to come back into play, that $800 million -- how should we think about the capital allocation at that point? Would we reverse some of what we're seeing today or not necessarily? Would it be added if at that point?"", 'Gale E. Klappa', ""That's a great question, Neil. And I'm going to ask Scott to give you his view on this as well. I would say, first of all, it wouldn't be surprising, at least to me, if some of the capital that is currently on pause in Illinois would come back, simply because of the need to continue safety. So looking at it a little more broadly, Neil, our view is the sweet spot of growth is still 6.5% to 7% a year. So I think we have to see, Scott, where we stand in terms of additional infrastructure investments that we have in the pipeline. But as Scott said, we have several hundred million dollars of those projects now that are in final due diligence stages. Scott?"", 'Scott J. Lauber', ""No, absolutely. And then when you think about the S&P program, unfortunately, about 1,000 workers stopped doing work at the end of the year here. So depending on how long it takes, it may take a while to ramp it up efficiently, too. So you would -- we'd really evaluate that as we get through these hearings or re-hearings."", 'Gale E. Klappa', ""Yes. Actually, Scott is making a great point. I mean you can't just turn it on a dime. So if indeed, just thinking out aloud with you, Neil, if indeed, the commission investigation of the program or their review of the need for the program lasts a year, which the order yesterday suggested a year, but it also said if it could be expedited with all the proper information, they would welcome that. . But I wouldn't think that it could be turned on back to its full level even if authorized to do so this year."", 'Neil Andrew Kalton', ""Got it. Makes sense. And one quick follow-up. Couldn't help but notice. I guess the -- we had thought the CapEx coming out, the $800 million would be replaced one for one, and instead I think you've added $300 million to the program. And just curious as to what drove that? Obviously, it entailed a little more equity to do that."", 'Gale E. Klappa', ""Yes, Neil, as we continue to get more detailed and granular information about the need to support the economic growth, in particular in the I-94 corridor that we talked about. Clearly, there's going to need to be some additional distribution investment. No question about that. And then there's also some additional renewable need. So those were the 2 things, all regulated, all Wisconsin. But really driven by the continued expansion and location. And I just mentioned in the script, as you may recall, another major investment by a company based in Atlanta called WestRock with a 587,000 corrugated box production plan. So the economic growth is just amazing. I would encourage anybody. In fact, we're going to invite all of you to come see what we're seeing on the ground here in the not-too-distant future. The economic growth, the expansions that we're seeing in that I-94 corridor are just literally amazing."", 'Operator', 'And our next question comes from the line of Jeremy Tonet with JPMorgan.', 'Gale E. Klappa', 'Rock n Roll, Jeremy.', 'Jeremy Bryan Tonet', ""Just wanted to kind of come back to Illinois overall here. And given the lower-than-expected rate case outcomes from the ICC than you expected. What's your current view, I guess, on Illinois as a regulatory jurisdiction here? And how have conversations with stakeholders been trending regarding the longer-term outlook for Illinois and Gas Illinois?"", 'Gale E. Klappa', ""Well, I think clearly, we're going to see a lot more evidence as we move through 2024 because there are really 2 dockets now of a very significant importance that are in their absolute beginning stage. The first occurred yesterday, when the Illinois Commission authorized the start of their review of our safety modernization program. And then they're also beginning this look at, which will take, we think, at least a year, just look at the Future of Gas in the state of Illinois. Actually, we're looking forward to both of these dockets. Because there will be broad-based evidence from all kinds of parties, intervenors across the board, who all have an opinion on this. I would just simply say that we're encouraged by the fact that there's going to be open, productive discussion in both of these dockets. And when you step back and think about it, particularly with the fact that we talked about earlier, where from a safety standpoint, these cast iron pipes, 80% of them have a remaining life of less than 15 years. I think at the end of the day, Illinoisans are pretty practical. And at the end of the day, I think we're going to get to a very reasonable point. This policy is just too important to the future, not only from an Energy supply standpoint, but from an economic standpoint for the state of Illinois. Scott, do you want to add anything to that?"", 'Scott J. Lauber', 'No, I agree. It just -- it will be good to get the facts on the table and everyone be able to talk about the issues and work through it. So we have a lot of good information and willing to provide it.', 'Jeremy Bryan Tonet', ""Got it. That's helpful there. And then just want to pivot towards Wisconsin here. With the PSC, we've seen kind of some rapid turnover, if you will, and just wondering, I guess, updated thoughts on commission outlook and relationships going forward given the changes we've seen?"", 'Gale E. Klappa', ""Well, I think probably the most significant change, obviously, is Chairman Valcq deciding that she would like to retire from the position and Summer Strand, who was appointed last year by the governor becoming the new Chair. And I would just simply repeat what we've said before about the qualifications that Summer Strand has in her background in energy policy, her background in construction and engineering very, very well suited to a position like this. So we're looking forward to working even more closely with Summer. And then the other most recent appointment is a person who's been at the commission and has headed up divisions and staffs at the commission for, I believe, more than a decade. So a good bit of experience to join Summer Strand. And Scott, I think we feel like we're both of these appointments are very balanced."", 'Scott J. Lauber', 'Yes, very balanced and having that experience in the commission and be able to fill one of the spots very quickly is good to see.', 'Jeremy Bryan Tonet', 'Got it. And maybe just a last one, if I could. Just thoughts about the Energy Infrastructure segment in general versus the regulated utilities. There was a pivot, kind of a way before and then back towards it. And so just wondering how you think about, I guess, investments in the 2 different sides. And are you targeting higher returns on the Infrastructure business, in excess of the authorized ROEs. So just wondering kind of how you see the gives and takes there given the shifts in CapEx in recent years?', 'Gale E. Klappa', ""Well, let me start and we'll let Scott give you his view on this as well. Let me start by saying that when we originally laid out our new 5-year capital plan, which would have been in early November, but it was before, obviously, the rate order decision in the Illinois. Essentially that plan to achieve a 6.5% to 7% EPS growth -- that plan crowded out, if you will, a number of Infrastructure projects that we had in the due diligence pipeline. So really, it was not all that difficult to begin to look at what alternatives do we have here for high-quality projects. I would say there are kind of 2 things related to your question. The first is -- the first is that we are still seeing a significant number of high-quality projects that we're looking at, number one. Number two, we target in the neighborhood of an 8% unlevered IRR, that's kind of basically the way we look at this. That should result in a return slightly higher than the regulated business. But I would just add, and Scott can add on to this. For a number of the projects, and we probably don't talk enough about this, we're building flexibility for our regulated business, particularly, Scott, for the projects that are in the MISO footprint."", 'Scott J. Lauber', ""That's exactly right, Gale. So when these PPAs wind down at the end, 10, 15 years, we'll have the ability then perhaps to either repower -- repower them, find another offtaker or especially in the MISO footprint, move them into the regulated utility here as we continue to decarbonize. So I think there's a lot of opportunities here. And when we look at these projects, we also look at getting all the cash back within 10 years and for sure in the time of the PPA. So we're really looking at it as good cash flow, but also opportunities here in the regulated long term."", 'Gale E. Klappa', 'Does that respond to your question?', 'Jeremy Bryan Tonet', ""Yes, that's helpful. I'll leave it there."", 'Operator', 'And our next question comes from the line of Durgesh Chopra with Evercore ISI.', 'Durgesh Chopra', 'Just a clarification on 2024 EPS guidance. Does that include the 300-megawatt project that you might be executing on or rather buying in the -- I think you said in the first half, the solar project?', 'Gale E. Klappa', ""Yes, it does. Yes. And we're in final due diligence right now on that project. However, the project itself is not yet commercial. It's close, but it's not yet commercial."", 'Durgesh Chopra', 'Got it. So in that $4.80 to $4.90 range, we should be modeling like half a year plus contribution from that project?', 'Gale E. Klappa', ""That's fair. Absolutely. That's fair."", 'Durgesh Chopra', ""Okay. And then maybe just, Xia, just can you update us on the timing of equity. I think you're targeting a small amount this year and then sort of pro rata going forward, setting the numbers of $100 million to $200 million this year and then $450 million a year starting in 2025. How should we think about that with a slightly higher equity number now?"", 'Xia Liu', ""Nothing is new, Durgesh. The $100 million to $200 million, we're on the way getting there. We turned on the dividend reinvestment plan and employee benefit plans as of January 1 this year. And we have seen shares coming in so far. And traditionally, those programs give us between $100 million to $200 million. If not, we'll turn on the ATM program, later in the year. And then going forward, it will be a combination of benefit programs and the ATM program."", 'Durgesh Chopra', ""So just to be clear, though, the total equity issuance amount doesn't -- it should still be in that $100 million to $200 million range. I guess what I was really asking is the incremental equity, I know it's small. That's going to be just kind of 2025 and beyond?"", 'Xia Liu', 'Correct. Yes. Exactly.', 'Gale E. Klappa', 'Yes.', 'Operator', 'And our next question comes from the line of Michael Sullivan with Wolfe Research.', 'Michael P. Sullivan', ""I wanted to just parse out the '24 guide a little bit more. How much year-over-year uplift are you getting from the Energy Infrastructure segment? And can you just confirm the Solar project, is it going to be taking PTC or ITC?"", 'Gale E. Klappa', ""We'll let Xia give you the breakdown, but the solar project that we're in final due diligence on would be PTCs. Not ITCs, PTCs. So we're not -- to your point, we're not playing accounting games. We're not trying to take some giant one time leap forward here, it would be the standard approach that we've used on all of our other Infrastructure projects. Xia?"", 'Xia Liu', ""Yes, I would look at it holistically. So '23 to '24, we talked about the reduction from Illinois. That's $0.10 to $0.12. And we have some interest headwinds in the year and a little bit of O&M. And offsetting that, you would see Wisconsin, ATC and WEC to offset those headwinds. So overall, that's the increase from the $4.63 to midpoint $4.85."", 'Michael P. Sullivan', ""Okay. And then just on sticking with '24, the O&M increase, how much of that was kind of known, I guess, through most of last year? And how much of it popped up more recently? Like I don't know if you could piece out this January storm and then the -- these projects, it sounds like there's a little bit of reg lag on. Yes. What was kind of like known versus more recent development of the O&M uptick?"", 'Gale E. Klappa', ""Well, we'll let Xia give you the more detailed answer, but long story short, the lion's share of the O&M increase is already recovered in rates. I mean they were driven by asset additions, I mean driven by -- mostly by asset additions that have come into service and were recovered in the last rate cases. Xia?"", 'Xia Liu', ""Yes. And that's it. So about 1% -- I call it out 5% of those. We already knew. 1% of that was related to storm. The rest would be the O&M and related to assets in the rate cases, as well as additional WEC Infrastructure projects."", 'Michael P. Sullivan', 'Okay. Do you have that on, sorry, go ahead, Gale.', 'Gale E. Klappa', 'No, I was just going to say, if you just think about it broadly, as we add assets, you add O&M to basically operate those assets and we added a considerable -- I mean, we added a considerable number of renewable assets, infrastructure projects, et cetera. But if you look at core O&M, I mean, core O&M is very, very under control.', 'Michael P. Sullivan', 'Okay. Just -- can you put the storm onetime in like an earnings per share basis?', 'Gale E. Klappa', ""Scott, I think we're talking, the January storm $8 million-ish..."", 'Scott J. Lauber', ""Yes, it's about $0.02."", 'Michael P. Sullivan', 'Okay. Okay. And -- and then kind of just shifting to this upcoming Wisconsin rate case, any like high-level sense of the size of the rate increase we should be anticipating there?', 'Gale E. Klappa', 'Scott, go ahead.', 'Scott J. Lauber', ""So we're currently pulling all those numbers together. As you can tell, we've been working on filling in the hole from the Illinois capital. But we're currently working on those numbers. We've got these asset additions that we're putting in this year. And of course, there will be some inflation as we look at the O&M. So we don't have a final number yet, but we should know by the end of the first quarter here, when we file something, but it's -- everything seems reasonable as we're pulling stuff together."", 'Michael P. Sullivan', 'Okay. Like within the range of where the last case was, in terms of like opening ask, ballpark, is that fair?', 'Scott J. Lauber', ""Yes. Yes, I doubt it to be higher than that. It will be in that ballpark or a little less, I would think. We're still pulling those together though, and we got to factor a lot of stuff in and look at like the production tax credits we're getting on the Solar that just went into service and factor in that all in."", 'Gale E. Klappa', ""And you'll see the filing in the second quarter."", 'Operator', 'And our next question comes from the line of Andrew Weisel with Scotiabank.', 'Andrew Marc Weisel', ""Two quick follow-ups on the commissioners in Wisconsin. So obviously, some new faces there. First question, just to confirm, that turnover won't have any impact on the timing or outcome of the rate case, right? Well, I shouldn't say outcome. It won't impact the timing, right?"", 'Gale E. Klappa', 'No. The timing has been set by commission policy. I would expect no change.', 'Andrew Marc Weisel', ""Okay. Great. The other question I had relates to former Commissioner, Tyler Huebner, he was ousted, if you will, by the Republican-led Senate. And a lot of the media reports make it sound like a lot of the pushback from that Senate was around his support for renewables and solar in particular. So my question is, do you worry that the state's commitment to renewables might potentially be changing politically? And if so, would that impact your spending strategy at all?"", 'Gale E. Klappa', ""Short answer is, no. And in fact, I don't know what you were reading, but I really don't think his support for renewables or solar was really a deciding factor in the Senate vote at all. I would just ask you to go back and perhaps read some of the other -- actually, there are very specific comments that were made by members of the Senate Energy Committee, news releases that were put out after the fact, explaining the action. But it wasn't -- at least in our view, it was not at all related to the fact that he felt a certain amount of renewables were needed, not at all."", 'Andrew Marc Weisel', ""Okay. Great. That's reassuring. Then just a very quick follow-up on equity. I understand this slightly higher equity related to the higher CapEx. What about the write-down following the Illinois rate case and disallowances? Are you not expecting that to lead to additional equity? Or are you awaiting results of rehearings or potential court cases before you decide?"", 'Xia Liu', ""That write-down, the additional equity will sent down to Illinois. That's already in the 5-year plan. It's included in the new equity numbers I gave you."", 'Gale E. Klappa', ""So we've already baked into the 5-year plan."", 'Operator', 'Our next question comes from the line of Paul Fremont with Ladenburg.', 'Paul Basch Michael Fremont', ""I guess my first question is, does -- when you look at sort of the '28 outlook for the company, the 5% decrease in the Natural Gas Distribution segment, what does that assume in terms of outcomes in Illinois?"", 'Gale E. Klappa', ""It assumes the status quo because we just don't know exactly the outcome of the Safety Modernization review. Scott?"", 'Scott J. Lauber', ""Right. So it assumes that we will still be doing emergency work and work for the city and some of those real reliability needs. But we're assuming the status until they get through the system -- the Safety Modernization Program and review that neighborhood program, we don't have any of that in there."", 'Gale E. Klappa', ""So Scott's right, it assumes some spending because we have to do emergency work related to -- I mean, if you can't fix a pipe and you have to replace it, we have to do that emergency work. And we really do need to cooperate with the city of Chicago when they're replacing their water mains, for example. So -- but beyond that, it does not assume any return to the full roughly $280 million a year. It does not assume that."", 'Paul Basch Michael Fremont', 'And presumably, I mean, if the outcome were favorable in Illinois, would that potentially change upward?', 'Gale E. Klappa', ""It certainly could. We'll just have to see the outcome. And we probably won't know more on that, though, until -- what you think, Scott?"", 'Scott J. Lauber', ""Late, at the end of next year, the same time as this year. It's going to take a while to get through, which is -- they want to be thorough. So that's good."", 'Gale E. Klappa', ""And because it's not only a specific look at the Safety Modernization Program, but with a separate docket on the Future of Gas. There will be broad policy decisions within a year, we believe."", 'Paul Basch Michael Fremont', 'Great. And then, can you discuss what comprises the added Infrastructure investment? Is that all essentially renewable investment?', 'Gale E. Klappa', 'Oh, yes. Yes, largely solar, but yes, all renewable.', 'Paul Basch Michael Fremont', 'Great. And any update on the tender or -- and where are you in the tender? Because the early period, I think, expired. When does the tender expire?', 'Gale E. Klappa', 'Xia has all the details for you. And yes, the early tender has run its course.', 'Xia Liu', 'Yes. The early tender has expired. We expect to tender a little over $120 million, out of the $500 million, so all that is coming together.', 'Paul Basch Michael Fremont', ""So are you're still waiting for the regular tender to expire, right?"", 'Xia Liu', ""Correct. But given the expiration of the early tender, we don't expect much pickup up to the early expiration date."", 'Paul Basch Michael Fremont', 'Okay. And then, I guess, last question, when would we see sort of the annual breakout of the change in your spending? So in other words, the 5-year numbers?', 'Xia Liu', ""We have that in the 10-K, so we'll issue the 10-K in February, and then we have a February investor deck, which will give you the details for the next 3 years."", 'Operator', 'And our next question comes from the line of Julien Dumoulin-Smith with Bank of America.', 'Julien Patrick Dumoulin-Smith', ""There's been a lot of conversation on all sides on legislation in Illinois and a lot of different parties coming to the table. Obviously, it doesn't seem entirely right or obvious where that's going. But -- how do you see that kind of meshing up against these various dockets, whether it's Future of Gas or frankly, your own rehearing. We're just kind of getting a cohesive set of policies, maybe aligning with the governor around or what have you. I mean how do you see that possibly coming together? Like what venue even, if you will?"", 'Gale E. Klappa', ""Well, I think -- I'm not sure if there's a clear answer to that, but I can give you my opinion and let you know my opinion on this because it's not a clear answer, it could be wrong. But my sense is that every major step that we're going to see going forward is going to be under the umbrella of implementing what we call CEJA, the Clean Energy Jobs Act. And I think that you see that path very clearly discussed with -- by Chairman, Scott, as he talks about his decisions and the Commission's decisions being tied to implementation of that Clean Energy Jobs Act. So that's, I think, the framework or the umbrella under which a lot of all of these dockets are going to proceed, if you will. And I think the Chairman sees his job as his mandate from the Governor, of basically putting into action that piece of legislation. And one of the most important steps now is going to be at the Commission and with that docket that they've now just authorized looking at the Future of Gas in the state of Illinois. And again, that's going to be very open, very productive. I think all the stakeholders are going to have their say. And I would just say to you, at the end of the day, Midwesterners, Illinoisans are pretty practical people. So I think we're going to end up with a practical result. That would be my projection at the end of all of those discussions. Scott, anything to add?"", 'Scott J. Lauber', ""No, nothing additional Gale. I agree with you. We'lll probably go through that process."", 'Gale E. Klappa', 'I hope that responds to your question, Julien.', 'Julien Patrick Dumoulin-Smith', ""Absolutely. I know it's a little opaque for the time being. But appreciate it. Look, actually, related, if we can, just talking about QIP, I mean, obviously, there's an element of trying to get recovery here of spending. Is there any portion of spending that can be funneled through that or related riders here? I mean how do you think about lag in the context of spending in Illinois? I mean obviously, you're pulling back on spending here, but I just want to try to make sure we kind of calibrate accordingly to how to think about the business and the ability to earn at or near you are authorized, if you will?"", 'Gale E. Klappa', ""Well, I think it's a great question. I think the short answer is, really to be found in the docket that now is being authorized and will come to a conclusion by June 1 or we expect early June at the latest. So there were -- under that Safety Modernization Program, you call it QIP, which was the piece of legislation that authorized a rider to recover these investments, a bill rider. There were several buckets of activity that were included in that legislation and recovered through that rider.One of the buckets, we feel just has to continue. As Scott mentioned earlier, it's the emergency work and it's the work that, for example, we do in conjunction with the city of Chicago, they are actively replacing aging water mains. And it doesn't make a lot of sense to rip up the streets twice. So we work together, and we work together very well to accomplish what we need to accomplish as they were doing their work. That bucket also got paused in the Commission's order, as well as the big piece of the plan, which is the neighborhood work, going neighborhood by neighborhood based on risk, to upgrade the safety and put in new modern state-of-the-art piping.So the piece that we're saying to them that, look, we really need to continue and get appropriate recovery for is a $134 million. It's that bucket of work relating to emergency things that we have to do and to work, for example, like with the city of Chicago. So that piece is what we're asking for a recovery on and we should get an answer, Scott, I believe, by early June."", 'Scott J. Lauber', ""Yes. We expect that in June. And then the remaining, as you look at the neighborhood programs, and we think it will take about a year to go through the docket, that then would have to be looked at in a forward-looking test year, I'd imagine, as we put rates together. So there will be really 2 steps here."", 'Julien Patrick Dumoulin-Smith', 'Indeed.', 'Gale E. Klappa', ""So that's the story. I was just going to say watch this space. There will be a lot of activity over the course of the next 12 months."", 'Operator', 'Our final question today comes from the line of Paul Patterson with Glenrock Associates.', 'Paul Patterson', ""So following up on Julien's question on rate lag as you, I'm sure, aware that you were one of a number of decisions that happened late in 2023, that were not what the utilities kind of expected. And as you know, Gale, you've been doing this a long time. We may be entering into an environment where there just is less appetite for the CapEx spending and more of a desire for bang for the buck kind of approach or regulatory lag, as Julian was bringing up. I guess, sort of a bigger picture question, a, I mean, at least where I'm looking at that, that's what I see, if you disagree, let me know. And then secondly, how do you think, because you've been doing this long time, and you've seen this kind of environment in the past, I'm sure. What -- how you might approach the situation in which there's just a hesitancy to continue with mechanisms like the S&P or at least augmenting them or changing them in such a way that it might be a bit more of a challenge. I just wanted to -- just wondering sort of big picture if you can sort of address that."", 'Gale E. Klappa', ""Yes, I'd be happy to. And as you ask the question, there are 2 specific things that really come to my mind. The first is that -- I mean, we're obviously only going to make investments that follow public policy. And public policy on the Safety Modernization Program, on the Future of Gas in Illinois are going to be decided in the next 12 months. Having said that, there's a -- I believe there's a certain amount of investment that's simply going to have to take place for the safety of Chicagoans. What amount that is, I don't know. In terms of what decision might be made. But I can't imagine the Safety Modernization Program, maybe it's changed, maybe it's not, but I can't imagine that investment going to 0. Just from a pure practical standpoint, I don't think that's feasible in terms of protecting the city of Chicago or preparing the city of Chicago for an energy future that could include renewable natural gas, hydrogen any other type of fuel. So that's kind of piece 1. Piece 2, just remember that under normal circumstances, Illinois has a future test period. Their rate cases have a 1-year future test period, which does help to mitigate any kind of issue related to regulatory lag on a normal ongoing basis. And then I guess the other thing that I would add is look at just the adjustments we've made since November 16, in our capital plan. I mean, I mentioned earlier, 3 megatrends are driving the kind of investment opportunity that we have in front of us, which is robust. And those 3 megatrends are basically reliability, the incredible economic growth that we're seeing in terms of expansion and attraction here of businesses and industrial customers. And then the third -- and these are all important decarbonization.So I don't see, regardless of the outcome in Illinois, any type of really diminished opportunity, Scott, in terms of the broad avenues that we have for productive investment that support those trends."", 'Scott J. Lauber', ""No. And when you're looking at it, when you think about the decarbonization, it's more than that because a lot of these power plants that are retiring, it's either invest hundreds of millions of dollars there or in a carbon-free resource and doesn't cost anything for the fuel. So there's also cost savings there in the long term with the production tax credit. So we do have a lot of opportunities here."", 'Gale E. Klappa', 'Paul, does that respond?', 'Paul Patterson', 'Appreciate it.', 'Gale E. Klappa', 'All right. Well, I think we wore you guys out today. So that concludes our conference call for this afternoon. Thank you so much for your questions and for participating as always. And if you have any additional thoughts or questions, Beth Straka is happy to pick up the phone. She can be reached at (414) 221-4639. Thanks, everybody, so long.', 'Operator', ""Thanks, Gale. Ladies and gentlemen, that concludes today's call. Thank you all for joining, and you may now disconnect.""]"

In the first stage we need to estimate the cash flows to the business over the next ten years. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period.

In this calculation we've used 6.2%, which is based on a levered beta of 0.800. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole.

I'm pleased to share that we expect continued strong growth in 2024, driven by demand for our products, which Caroline will speak to momentarily.Turning to the progress we're making in research. We're currently pursuing programs across a more diverse set of therapeutic areas with high unmet need and across more modalities than at any time in recent memory. This year, we will remain keenly focused on advancing our broad and diverse pipeline, which includes 2 launches that will address critical health needs and have blockbuster commercial opportunity.In cardiometabolic, we're very excited by the anticipated FDA action on our application for sotatercept in the United States, which we believe has the potential to transform the treatment journey for many patients suffering from pulmonary arterial hypertension. Our commercial and manufacturing teams are fully prepared for the strong uptake we expect. Sotatercept is an important component of our growing cardiometabolic pipeline, which we believe has significant long-term potential.In vaccines, the FDA accepted for priority review our filing for V116. If approved, V116 would be the first vaccine, specifically designed to address the majority of invasive pneumococcal disease in adults ages 65 and older. Based on its compelling profile, V116 has the potential to become an important new preventative option for adults, and we believe it can achieve majority market share in this setting. We look forward to a potential approval in June.And in oncology, we continue to expand into additional tumor types in earlier stages of certain cancers as well as progress our increasingly broad pipeline of novel candidates. We have achieved substantial diversification with a dramatically expanded set of late-stage programs, which Dean will speak to. I'm confident that Merck is well positioned to provide important innovation to patients and sustain its leadership in oncology, well into the future. I know Dean and his team are energized by our progress and are prepared to build on the success we've had in 2023 to further advance Merck's pipeline and bring transformative innovation to patients this year and beyond.In summary, our science-led strategy, which keeps the patient at the center of everything we do, is delivering important advancements and helping us build a sustainable growth engine for our company. We've made considerable progress over the past year in advancing and expanding our pipeline, which has resulted in substantially increased long-term commercial opportunities. We've taken meaningful steps to diversify and position ourselves for sustained leadership in oncology, while also building one of our deepest and broadest pipelines across discovery and development in our recent history outside of oncology and notably in cardiometabolic and immunology. Further, we also expect to benefit from promising late-stage programs across our vaccines, neurosciences, HIV and animal health pipelines, a robust set of early-phase programs and the potential to add exciting innovation through future science-led business development. As a result, we are increasingly confident that we're well positioned to drive patient impact and value creation this year and well into the next decade.I would again like to thank our global teams for their commitment to strong research, commercial and operational execution. With a concerted focus on achieving continued excellence, I'm very confident in our ability to deliver short- and long-term stakeholder value. I look forward to providing future updates on our progress and impact.With that, I'll turn the call over to Caroline."", 'Caroline Litchfield', ""Thank you, Rob. Good morning. 2023 was another impactful year for our company. We delivered strong revenue growth of 12%, excluding LAGEVRIO and foreign exchange. Growth was driven by robust performance across Oncology, Vaccines and Animal Health. We remain confident in our ability to continue to deliver strong results in the near term while making disciplined investments in innovative science, which will drive long-term value for patients and shareholders. Now turning to our fourth quarter results. Total company revenues were $14.6 billion. Excluding the impact from LAGEVRIO and foreign exchange, the business delivered strong growth of 13%. The following revenue comments will be on an ex-exchange basis. Our Human Health business sustained its momentum. Excluding LAGEVRIO, growth was 14% driven by Oncology and Vaccines. Sales in our Animal Health business increased 4%, driven by companion animal products.Turning to the performance of our key brands. In Oncology, sales of KEYTRUDA grew 22% to $6.6 billion. Global growth was driven by increased uptake in earlier-stage cancers, including triple-negative breast cancer and renal cell carcinoma, with particularly strong growth in international markets due to the more recent launches of these important indications. Growth was also driven by the strong global need of patients with metastatic disease.We continue to be encouraged by the positive impact our recent approvals are having on certain patients with earlier-stage non-small cell lung cancer. In the U.S., we have made considerable progress in helping to improve drug treatment rates and have further increased our leadership position in the adjuvant setting.We also received positive feedback from health care providers following the recent launch of KEYNOTE-A39 in advanced urothelial cancer. With this approval, KEYTRUDA in combination with PADCEV is now indicated for first-line advanced urothelial cancer patients, regardless of cisplatin eligibility. Based on the outstanding clinical data, we believe this regimen has the potential to transform the standard of care for these patients.Alliance revenue from Lynparza and Lenvima grew 8% and 5%, respectively. WELIREG sales grew 78% to $72 million driven by increased uptake in VHL-associated tumors. We are excited by the opportunity to provide a new treatment option for certain patients with previously treated advanced renal cell carcinoma, following the recent approval based on the LITESPARK-005 study.Our Vaccines portfolio delivered excellent growth led by GARDASIL, which increased 27% to $1.9 billion, driven by global demand, particularly in China. In the U.S., GARDASIL sales benefited from CDC purchasing patterns.VAXNEUVANCE sales grew to $176 million driven by ongoing launches in Europe and continued uptake of the pediatric indication in the U.S. As a reminder, fourth quarter 2022 sales in the U.S. benefited from inventory stocking in preparation for the pediatric launch.In our hospital acute care portfolio, BRIDION sales declined 3%. Increased market share among neuromuscular blockade reversal agents in the U.S. was more than offset by the impact of generic entrants in international markets, particularly in Europe.Our Animal Health business delivered another solid quarter with sales increasing 4%. Companion animal sales grew 12% driven by the BRAVECTO line of product due to strong underlying demand and timing of purchases. Livestock sales were flat, reflecting favorable price actions, offset by the timing of ruminant product purchases.I will now walk you through the remainder of our P&L, and my comments will be on a non-GAAP basis. Gross margin was 77.2%, an increase of 1.5 percentage points, largely due to favorable product mix, including a benefit from lower sales of LAGEVRIO. Operating expenses increased to $11.6 billion, including a $5.5 billion onetime charge related to our collaboration with Daiichi Sankyo. Excluding this charge, operating expenses grew 8%, reflecting disciplined investment in support of our expansive early- and late-phase pipeline and key growth drivers. Other expense was $174 million.Our tax rate was approximately 114%, which reflects the impact of the charge related to Daiichi Sankyo. Excluding this charge, the underlying tax rate was 13.1%. Taken together, earnings per share were $0.03, which includes a $1.69 negative impact from the charge related to Daiichi Sankyo.Now turning to our 2024 non-GAAP guidance. We expect another year of strong growth driven by key marketed products, and we'll begin to benefit from the anticipated launches of impactful new products, such as sotatercept and V116. We project revenue to be between $62.7 billion and $64.2 billion, representing growth of 4% to 7%. This growth includes a negative impact from foreign exchange of approximately 2% using mid-January rates. The headwind is primarily due to the devaluation of the Argentine peso, which we expect will largely be offset by inflation-related price increases, consistent with market practice.Our gross margin assumption is approximately 80.5%, which includes the benefit from reduced royalties paid on KEYTRUDA and GARDASIL. Operating expenses are assumed to be between $25.1 billion and $26.1 billion, which includes an approximate $650 million onetime charge related to the announced acquisition of Harpoon Therapeutics. As a reminder, our guidance does not assume additional significant potential business development transactions.Other expense is expected to be approximately $200 million. We assume a full-year tax rate between 14.5% and 15.5%. We assume approximately 2.54 billion shares outstanding. Taken together, we expect EPS of $8.44 to $8.59. This range includes an approximate $0.26 per share charge related to the planned acquisition of Harpoon Therapeutics, which is not tax-deductible, and the negative impact from foreign exchange of approximately $0.25 using mid-January rates, including the impact from Argentina.Now turning to capital allocation, where our strategy remains unchanged. We will prioritize investments in our business to drive near- and long-term growth. We are excited by the significant progress our team has made to advance and augment our innovative pipeline in 2023. In 2024, we will increase this investment, including the initiation of more late-stage clinical trials across multiple novel candidates, each of which has significant potential to address important unmet medical needs.We remain committed to our dividend and plan to increase it over time. Business development remains a high priority. We maintain ample capacity given our strong investment-grade credit rating and cash flow to pursue additional science-driven, value-enhancing transactions going forward. We will continue to execute a modest level of share repurchases.To conclude, we enter 2024 with confidence in the outlook for our business in the near and long term. Global demand for our innovative medicines and vaccines remain strong, and we are excited about our expansive pipeline. We are in a position of financial and operational strength as a direct result of our long-standing commitment to science in order to improve the lives of the patients we serve. Our continued investments in innovation and excellent execution will enable us to deliver value to patients, customers and shareholders well into the future.With that, I'd now like to turn the call over to Dean."", 'Dean Y. Li', 'Thank you, Caroline. Good morning. Today, I will provide notable R&D updates since our last earnings call and a brief summary of 2023 accomplishments. Momentum in the pipeline remains strong. Progress is spanning both early- and late-phase programs across multiple therapeutic areas.Starting with oncology. We are diversifying our portfolio and executing on our strategy, which is broadly based on 3 strategic pillars: immuno-oncology; precision molecular targeting; and tissue targeting. In immuno-oncology, we remain committed to the development of KEYTRUDA and further transforming cancer care to address the needs of certain patients. In the fourth quarter, we received approvals from both the FDA and the European Commission in 2 gastrointestinal indications: one in combination with chemotherapy for the first-line treatment of adults with locally-advanced unresectable or metastatic HER2-negative gastric or gastroesaphageal junction adenocarcinoma based on KEYNOTE-A59; and another in combination with gemcitabine and cisplatin for the treatment of patients with locally-advanced unresectable or metastatic biliary tract cancer based on KEYNOTE-966.As we continue to harness the potential of KEYTRUDA, we have an increased focus on earlier stages of disease, where we believe timely, effective intervention may significantly improve patient outcomes. Last month, we announced FDA approval for KEYTRUDA in combination with chemo radiotherapy for the treatment of FIGO Stage III through IVa cervical cancer based on the Phase III KEYNOTE-A18 trial. This is an important advancement and provides a new option that has potential to become the standard of care.To date, with all the research conducted with checkpoint inhibitors, the only studies to have demonstrated statistically significant overall survival benefit in earlier-stage cancers are KEYTRUDA-based regimens: KEYNOTE-671 as part of a neoadjuvant followed by post-surgery adjuvant treatment regimen for certain patients with resectable non-small cell lung cancer and KEYNOTE-564 as a post-surgery adjuvant treatment regimen for certain patients with renal cell carcinoma.Since the approval of a KEYNOTE-671 in October, it is notable that the American Cancer Society released guidance recommending that certain individuals with significant smoking history undergo an annual low-dose CT scan. The guidance also expands the age range for lung cancer screening. We look forward to the opportunity to help impact patients and support the identification of more patients at risk. Additional data from KEYNOTE-564 demonstrating an overall survival benefit were presented at the ASCO GU conference last week. Detailed findings from KEYNOTE-123 evaluating KEYTRUDA for the adjuvant treatment of patients with localized, muscle-invasive and locally-advanced resectable urothelial carcinoma demonstrating a disease-free survival benefit versus observation were also presented at ASCO GU.Also in the earlier-stage setting, along with our partner, Moderna, we announced 3-year recurrent-free survival and distant metastasis-free survival data for our individualized neoantigen therapy, V940, in combination with KEYTRUDA for the adjuvant treatment of Stage III and IV melanoma following complete resection. We are encouraged by the durability of the responses observed and the potential for this regimen to impact patients earlier in their diagnosis. The Phase III trials in the adjuvant setting for certain patients with melanoma and non-small cell lung cancer are actively enrolling. Progress continues in precision oncology. The FDA approval for WELIREG, our HIF2 alpha inhibitor for the treatment of adults with advanced RCC following a PD-1 or PD-L1 inhibitor and a VEGF-TKI, marks the first drug approved in a new therapeutic class for eligible patients with advanced renal cell carcinoma in nearly a decade and builds on the 2021 approval for the treatment of adults with certain von Hippel-Lindau disease-associated tumors. Additional Phase III studies for WELIREG, in combination with KEYTRUDA and/or lenvatinib for the treatment of certain types of renal cell carcinoma in the advanced and adjuvant settings, are ongoing.Finally, moving to the tissue targeting space. Together with Astellas and Seagen, now Pfizer, we announced the FDA approval for KEYTRUDA in combination with PADCEV, a Nectin-4-targeting ADC for the first-line treatment to patients with locally advanced or metastatic urothelial cancer based on results from KEYNOTE-A39. These results demonstrated a superior overall survival benefit versus gemcitabine plus cisplatin or carboplatin and extend our pioneering work in combining KEYTRUDA with chemotherapy as well as reinforcing the value of an ADC to enable targeted delivery of chemotherapy to the tumor tissue.Following the announcement of our collaboration with Daiichi Sankyo in October, we are pleased to receive priority review from the FDA for MK-1022, or patritumab deruxtecan, our investigation of a fully humanized anti-HER3 ADC for patients with advanced EGFR-mutated non-small cell lung cancer previously treated with 2 or more systemic therapies. The agency has set a target action date of June 26.Through our agreements with Kelun and Daiichi Sankyo as well as our own discovery programs, we have established a robust pipeline of tissue-targeting ADCs. And the recently announced acquisition of Harpoon Therapeutics provides the opportunity to help complement and strengthen our approach by providing a portfolio of novel T cell engagers, the most significant of which is HPN-328, an investigational delta-like ligand 3 targeting T cell engager being evaluated in small cell lung cancer and neuroendocrine tumors.Our strong diverse portfolio of immuno-oncology precision molecular and tissue-targeting agents positions us well to have a profound impact on even more patients long into the future.Next to our Vaccine pipeline. We are making notable advancements with our population-specific vaccine program for pneumococcal disease. The FDA has accepted for priority review the new biologics license application for V116, our 21-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine, specifically designed for adults supported by results from multiple Phase III clinical trials evaluating V116 in both pneumococcal vaccine-naive and vaccine-experienced adult patient population.Results from STRIDE-3 trial were presented at the World Vaccine Congress West Coast in November and additional data from STRIDE-3 as well as STRIDE studies 4, 5 and 6 will be presented at the International Society of Pneumonia and Pneumococcal Disease Congress in March. If approved, as Rob noted, V116 would be the first new pneumococcal-conjugate vaccine specifically designed to address the serotypes responsible for approximately 83% of invasive pneumococcal disease in adults 65 years of age and older, according to CDC data from 2018 to 2021. Importantly, V116 includes 8 unique serotypes, which account for 30% of disease according to the same CDC data. These serotypes are not covered by currently licensed pneumococcal vaccine options. The FDA has set a target action date of June 17.Turning to programs in the cardiometabolic disease pipeline. We are eager to bring sotatercept to patients as an important treatment option for pulmonary arterial hypertension. The FDA has set a target action date of March 26.Beyond data from the STELLAR trial, we have the Phase III ZENITH and HYPERION studies, which are evaluating sotatercept in patients with more advanced disease and those earlier on their disease journey. In addition, the Phase II CADENCE trial will evaluate WHO Group II pulmonary hypertension focused on a type of left heart disease.As we close out 2023, it is important to highlight our significant progress and execution across therapeutic areas and modalities as well as multiple business development transactions. In the year, we have more than 25 regulatory approvals in major markets. We also initiated over 20 Phase III studies across multiple new classes of assets, including in oncology with bomedemstat, our LSD1 inhibitor in essential thrombocythemia; nemtabrutinib, our BTK inhibitor in first-line chronic lymphocytic leukemia or small lymphocytic lymphoma; MK-2870, our TROP2 ADC in collaboration with Kelun in non-small cell lung cancer and endometrial carcinoma; MK-5284, our CYP11A1 inhibitor in collaboration with Orion in metastatic castrate-resistant prostate cancer; and V940 in collaboration with Moderna for the adjuvant treatment of certain types of melanoma and non-small cell lung cancer. Also in immunology, with tulisokibart in ulcerative colitis. Finally, in cardiometabolic disease with multiple trials for MK-0616 in hypercholesterolemia.As a result of the increasing depth and breadth of our pipeline, we are planning to initiate an even greater number of Phase III trials in 2024. Considerable credit goes to my colleagues across the organization for their hard work and unwavering dedication. We are executing on our science-led strategy and look forward to providing further updates on our progress throughout the year.And now I will turn the call back to Peter.', 'Peter Dannenbaum', ""Thank you, Dean. Ivy, we're now ready to take questions. (Operator Instructions) Thank you."", 'Operator', '(Operator Instructions) Our first question will come from the line of Umer Raffat from Evercore ISI.', 'Umer Raffat', ""I know there's a trial due for you guys later this year, KEYFORM-007 trial. That's the LAG-3 with pembrolizumab in colorectal cancer. Just curious how you're thinking about the risk profile and the odds of success heading into that and if there's been any interim OS analysis."", 'Dean Y. Li', ""I'll take this. Umer, thank you very much for that question. I mean just to recognize that in MSI high, we have a strong presence with pembro there. The larger group in CRC or colorectal cancer is in the MSS population. At this point, there's not really been any checkpoint inhibitor that's shown dramatic impact in MSS CRC. So our interest in driving pembro plus LAG-3 in that is to demonstrate that a checkpoint inhibitor could have a meaningful impact in MSS CRC.If we should get a positive signal in that, clearly, we would use that as a beachhead to expand and extend the role of checkpoint inhibitors in MSS CRC, which is a place that requires a lot of more innovation. In terms of specific interim analysis on this, we generally try to keep that when there's data that's worth sharing, that's when we share it."", 'Operator', ""Next, we'll go to the line of Trung Huynh from UBS."", 'Trung Chuong Huynh', ""So for sotatercept, we noticed the HYPERION study primary completion date has now moved to August 26. It was November 29 on clinicaltrials.gov. That's 3 years earlier. Just -- could you just let us know the reason for that change? And if I could sneak one in. Just is there a place to transition sotatercept from inpatient clinic administration to self-administration?"", 'Dean Y. Li', ""So let me take the first question. So there's a series of trials in relationships with sotatercept. So the March date that we talk about is for a potential decision by the FDA for approval based on the STELLAR trial. And we think in the second half of 2024, we may be in a position in relationship to the EU.We have other trials, as you point out, especially Phase III trials, and they are ZENITH and they are HYPERION. Those 2 are based on events. So it's a tracking of events that sort of define when those happen. So the ZENITH, I think, is now like September 2025 and HYPERION is August 2026. So that's just been event-driven.In relationship to how best to treat patients, well we're in conversations with the FDA in relationship to where is the best place for patients to be treated. But I'll just highlight that we have an image of an auto injector moving very fast through our pipeline. So that might give you a sense of where we think this may end up."", 'Operator', ""Next, we'll go to the line of Daina Graybosch from Leerink Partners."", 'Daina Michelle Graybosch', 'One on Oncology for one of the new assets going into Phase III, the ORION MK-5684. I wonder if you could talk more about that asset. And what gives you confidence that it will demonstrate broad benefit in prostate cancer, in addition to the patients with the ARLBD mutations? And can you confirm the stat design of the 2 Omaha studies will prioritize a hierarchy to statistically look at the mutation segment first?', 'Dean Y. Li', ""Yes. So just so that everyone is looking at this asset in the same way, there have been critical medicines that ablate androgen field growth in prostate cancer. And the interest in the CYP11A1 is it's very high upstream, and we think that it could be an important contribution.Clearly, we're in -- as you point out, we're interested both broadly, but especially in the specific mutation patients. And so we will be advancing those trials to look at that subpopulation as well as more broad populations. In terms of the statistical sort of analysis in that, that's something that I think probably would be best sort of discussed with our clinical teams at a different time."", 'Operator', ""Next, we'll go to Carter Gould from Barclays."", 'Carter Lewis Gould', 'Maybe following up on the commentary on V116. You talked about a potential to reach a majority market share. What does that sort of imply around the potential ACIP recommendation or the potential for a catch-up opportunity in the adult segment?', 'Dean Y. Li', ""Yes. So I'll just -- so again, we're talking about V116. We're talking about FDA potential action in June 2024, followed by ACIP, followed by MMWR. I think it's in March that we're going to be presenting STRIDE-3 and 6, and I think the data will be out there. And as you'll see in that, between STRIDE-3 and throughout STRIDE-3 all the way to 6, you'll see data in relationship to vaccination of those who are naive versus previously vaccinated. And you will see data in the patient population, or the population that 65, but also in the 50-plus as well. As that data is digested, both by the FDA, but probably very importantly, by the ACIP, I think those data will guide how the ACIP makes their decision."", 'Operator', ""Next, we'll go to the line of Evan Seigerman from BMO Capital Markets."", 'Evan David Seigerman', ""I was wondering if you could expand on some of the nuances of your guidance. Specifically, do you include meaningful revenues from sotatercept or V116? I'm assuming they're due for approval at some point this year."", 'Caroline Litchfield', ""Thank you for the question, Evan. This is Caroline. As we've guided for 2024, we're very confident in the underlying momentum in our business across Oncology, across Vaccines, across Animal Health. We also are very excited about the potential launches for sotatercept and V116.For sotatercept, given the significant clinical data we have and the understanding that there are many patients that have already been identified who can benefit for sotetecept on top of the treatments they have, we are expecting a strong launch. For V116, as Dean just outlined, we'll wait for the FDA approval, the ACIP recommendation. We'll then expect MMWR to publish, and therefore, expect to have impact with V116 coming towards the end of this year."", 'Operator', ""Next, we'll go to the line of Terence Flynn from Morgan Stanley."", 'Terence C. Flynn', 'A competitor recently reported some disappointing data with their TROP2 ADC and later line lung. I recognize these TROP2s are all different given the technology, the linkers. But does this impact at all your development strategy for your TROP2 in lung or perhaps increase the need for a biomarker strategy here?', 'Dean Y. Li', ""Yes. This is Dean. Thanks for that question. So I'll just step back, and I think I've said this previously, especially in lung, it's very important to understand what the standard of care is and that one would have to beat it in a significant way. And the standard of care, in our minds, in the late stage, is roughly KEYNOTE-189. And now in the earlier stage, it's clearly in KEYNOTE-671 both with clear OS data.What we have said previously is that we are unclear that any one ADC can have as broad of an impact as KEYNOTE-189 or 671 and that in order for ADC to have a substantial advantage in those patient populations, one may need to focus on a biomarker-selected patient population. And so the data that we saw does not change our way of thinking. It's the way of thinking that we've discussed previously.And I would just add that it's really important, there's also data out there where people are doing retrospective biomarker data in this. For us to demonstrate true efficacy in any patient population, we need a biomarker strategy that is prospective and one that can be easily actionable throughout the world."", 'Operator', ""Next, we'll go to the line of Tim Anderson from Wolfe Research."", 'Adam Jolly', ""This is Adam on for Tim. On GARDASIL, a 2-dose regimen was recently approved in China. We're wondering if that poses a revenue problem. Potentially, it doesn't, if it just means that more supply gets spread out across more people, and Merck ends up selling just as many doses in total. Can Merck share its perspective here?"", 'Robert M. Davis', ""No, Adam, thanks for the question. So there's actually been Chinese competitors with an offering for some time actually in the Chinese market. And that market is large. We continue to believe in the eligible cohorts in just the urban females, which is the Tier 1 to Tier 3 cities, is about 200 million -- a little over 200 million women. And so of that, we think probably about 30% have actually received vaccination. So you're still looking at 120 million, 130 million eligible population.As we look at this and as we've seen over time, we continue to be very competitive. We're maintaining a vast majority of share in the private market. And really, you're seeing most of the local competitors go to the lower-tier cities and to a different population than we've been targeting. So that does not change our view of the growth potential in China long term. Obviously, we will continue to face competition there, and we are positioning ourselves to continue to succeed there. But the approval you're talking about is not changing our view."", 'Caroline Litchfield', ""The only thing I add, if I may, is we have significant opportunity to protect further females in China. At the end of 2023, we also submitted to the regulatory authorities our data on GARDASIL for males. So we're hopeful to introduce that in the Chinese market in the future."", 'Operator', ""Next, we'll go to the line of Mohit Bansal from Wells Fargo."", 'Mohit Bansal', ""Congrats on the progress. Maybe one question on V116 as well. So Pfizer has recently made comments around adult market shrinking at this point. So could you comment on how do you see the peak opportunity for V116 in the context of adult market shrinking and then you're taking share from a shrinking market?"", 'Robert M. Davis', ""Yes. I'll start and then Caroline can jump in as well. But I think as you look at the market size and the comments, I don't want to speak to comments that others have made. I think it's also important to understand that as we bring a vaccine which brings significant incremental coverage, at 83% versus, if you look at PCV20, just as an example, it's closer to, I think, about 50%. So you're looking at significant incremental coverage, which I think can have an impact on how you think both about catch-up to cover the disease.As Dean noted in his prepared comments, we have 8 serotypes covering 30% of what is causing disease, which is unique to us. So we think that, that will have implications both in terms of catch-ups as well as potentially to be able to go for patients 50 and plus versus 65 and plus.So if you take all of those things into account, we still see this as a very large opportunity for us. Our view is it's about an $8 billion market in '23. We anticipate it actually growing to be over $10 billion later in the decade. And with that being the pediatric segment of that is about 70%. So we're looking at 30% of that is what is the adult piece. So as we see it, this is still a growing market, a good market. And we remain very confident that V116 will both have a majority share and be a meaningful contributor."", 'Operator', ""Next, we'll go to the line of Chris Schott from JPMorgan."", 'Christopher Thomas Schott', ""Just a bigger-picture question on business development. The company has obviously been very active the past few years. And I'm just trying to get a sense of just kind of size and stage of assets that you consider just given the current R&D investments you're making and the asset and kind of the amount of capital you're allocating there. So I guess, specifically, are deals along the lines of an Acceleron or a Prometheus still deals that Merck would look at and prioritize? Or at this point, should you be even thinking about maybe earlier-stage assets that would be more of the focus?"", 'Robert M. Davis', ""Yes. Chris, thanks for the question. Obviously, first, I just want to reinforce the pride I have in what Dean and the team have been able to do and the meaningful progress we're making both in our internal pipeline and what we've been able to do through the business development, which is, I think, in some ways, in a weird way, underlying your question.As we sit here today, while I feel very good about the progress we've made in the growing portfolio, the diverse and deep portfolio we have in our pipeline, we do continue to believe we need more, and we will continue to prioritize business development. And I would say that our views of deals like Prometheus, like Acceleron are still the size of deals we are very interested in, if we can find great assets. So clearly, that's an area of focus. But also continuing to do smaller deals as well, like what you saw with Harpoon.So it's going to be a range of deals. But I think as you look in that 0 to kind of $15 billion, $1 billion to $15 billion, it continues to be where we will look for. And then obviously, we've also, I think, shown that not only are we very open to doing acquisition, but we see collaboration as an important tool as well, very similar to what we did with Daiichi Sankyo. So we're going to be looking at the full suite and including deals that fit those categories."", 'Operator', ""Next, we'll go to the line of Andrew Baum from Citi."", 'Andrew Simon Baum', ""I was going to ask you about your expectations for the ACIP recommendation on revaccination of Prevnar vaccinated patients, but I suspect you may not want to share that view. So instead, maybe I could ask you about the first-line TROP2 SKB non-small cell trials that you're running in combination with KEYTRUDA. Some of the recently published academic data suggests that TROP2 internalization is a biomarker in patients who are primarily resistant to PD-1.So it just seems like an odd population to be exploring the drug in, assuming that is real and not a fake signal. And I take completely the caveats that it's retrospective data analysis in other settings. But given that, it would seem to be more sensible to have a combination with chemo and layering on top. And can you do this given the profile of the drug in terms of bone marrow suppression?"", 'Dean Y. Li', ""Yes. So I'll just answer more broadly in relationship to TROP2 as an ADC and specifically our compound. One of the things that is extremely useful to us is its adverse effect profile, especially for lung cancer patients and relationship to lung toxicity, is readily manageable. It's a quite good profile.In terms of your question about the paper that I think that you talked about internalization and this, I think those are interesting and important papers for us to consider. But I think one of the things that's also important for us to do is to do the clinical experiment and see what the results are in relationship. We are confident that TROP2 ADC will have an impact. TROP2 ADCs in breast cancer has had an impact. And we believe that our TROP2 ADC, especially the linker payload, will have an important impact in lung cancer.And then the question that you have is, how do you combine it? Do you combine it with chemo? Do you combine it with PD-1? How do you think through that? I think those are questions that our clinical team thinks deeply about, but we also think deeply about what line of therapy and also what the standard of care is. And if you want to move to first line standard of care is KEYNOTE-189 with a chemo/pembro basis. So one has to think about how one would advance a TROP2 from different lines all the way to first line. So those considerations come in quite heavily."", 'Operator', ""Next, we'll go to the line of Seamus Fernandez from Guggenheim Securities."", 'Seamus Christopher Fernandez', ""Congrats on the quarter and the guidance. Can you just talk a little bit about subcutaneous KEYTRUDA, how you anticipate payers' acceptance of this new delivery modality as well as potential economic benefits to patients given the shift from Part B to Part D? I think there could be some benefits from the updated catastrophic cap being drivers there. But struggling in the face of potential biosimilars of KEYTRUDA after 2028 to see how payers would treat this. Just interested to have a little bit more color on the economic benefits, not just the benefits to the patients of subcutaneous KEYTRUDA."", 'Dean Y. Li', ""So this is Dean. I'll take the first question, and then I'll hand it over to Rob and Caroline because the economic question and the payer is also related to the innovation that you provide. I just want to make sure that our way of thinking about something like pembro with hyaluronidase given as subcu is really there's going to be a call for that innovation.I'll just emphasize, we constantly speak about the earlier-stage cancer. And right now, we have 9 approvals. And as I've said in relationship in the prepared remarks, of those approvals, 2 -- the only 2 that have checkpoint inhibitors that OS benefit is KEYTRUDA base, which is early lung cancer and RCC.I actually just came from a meeting speaking to a bunch of thoracic oncologists in this, and it's quite interesting to hear how they speak for those who are thoracic oncologists, who are linked to a setting with medical oncologists, they very clearly understand why KEYNOTE-671 perioperative is a category 1.In situations where you may have a CT surgeon outside of a major care plan or a care -- a major medical center sometimes you have CT surgeons moonlighting doing lobectomies and resection for that, the KEYNOTE-091. And constantly, what we hear from the physicians and the provider, and many of them are in provider systems of all different types, is the need to have an alternative way to get the KEYTRUDA to them, either Q3, Q6 given the regimen. So I just want to emphasize that the subcu pembro plus hyaluronidase is an innovation that is going to be demanded and is being demanded by the field."", 'Robert M. Davis', ""Yes. Thanks, Dean. And to the questions on the economics, and I think we've commented on this a little bit in various settings. But as we think about our strategy for bringing this to the market from a commercial perspective, our view is the quality-of-life benefits this brings does demonstrate and afford us the ability to get a premium price. But we also are very cognizant that any subcu pembro will have to be considered in the context of a generic IV version.So we will price our subcu to drive for volume and to do for conversion, which means we will be looking at prices really more in line with where you would see the generic version at a premium that history has shown is very manageable and expected and covered by payers today when you look at the different delivery for them. So in that sense, we think we will be able to manage this.The whole question of Part B versus Part D, we'll have to see how it plays out as far as the ultimate side of administration. But if it does end up being into the Part D category, which is a reasonable chance, you are correct in that some of the new coverages that are out there in catastrophic and with a cap, also then from a patient perspective, should lower the burden they're going to face, which we also think could help with conversion."", 'Operator', ""Next, we'll go to the line of Geoff Meacham from Bank of America."", 'Geoffrey Christopher Meacham', ""Caroline, on margins, you highlighted a benefit from KEYTRUDA and GARDASIL this year, which I think was expected. But looking forward, is the guidance this year a reasonable target until the KEYTRUDA LOE? I wasn't sure if there's other drivers going forward or whether mix could impact margins as well."", 'Caroline Litchfield', ""Thank you for the question, Geoff. So as you all know, our company has made great progress in expanding operating margin over a number of years. As we look to 2024, we expect operating margin to improve. And that's really driven by the strength of the top line and mix of revenue by the roll-off of royalties that we've noted on KEYTRUDA and GARDASIL, being disciplined in our expenses, while we do invest fully behind our expansive pipeline.As we go beyond 2024, we still point to an operating margin of greater than 43% in 2025. But our focus as a company and as a team is to really ensure that we are fueling the pipeline, supporting the portfolio of products that we're launching to drive growth into the long term."", 'Operator', ""Next, we'll go to the line of Steve Scala from TD Cowen."", 'Stephen Michael Scala', ""I believe the Merck RSV monoclonal antibody Phase II/III study is registrational and reads out this year. Is that correct? And assuming positive, how soon could Merck be on the market? And how might this product be differentiated from by Fortis? It's just a little odd that this could be a $1 billion opportunity, not that far off, and Merck never talks about it."", 'Dean Y. Li', ""I really appreciate the question, so I will talk about it. In relationship to the RSV monoclonal antibody, it's for the early birth. It's an antibody, it's passive immunization, and it's for the pediatric population. This is a single shot. This is not weight-based, and we believe it has a longer season in relationship to other choices. And so we think it's an important readout, and we're very excited and interested to move on this RSV monoclonal antibody.I would also emphasize that the New England Journal of Medicine just published a series of papers, not in RSV, but also in dengue that also we're very excited about. And we're moving that forward quickly. And then more broadly from the ID vaccine, I've said previously that I'm very intrigued to see the results of our NRTTI islatravir and our other NRTTI, MK-8527. So that will also be coming out this year. We'll be able to see those. So it is the RSV. It is the dengue that was just out there, and it is the HIV data that we're going to be very interested in seeing across this year."", 'Robert M. Davis', ""Yes. And Steve, just to maybe, from a commercial perspective, build on the question, from a launch timing perspective, our expectation is that we would be in the market in 2025. And obviously, we're working to be ready for that season in 2025.And then from -- a differentiator for us, recall that our coverage covers what is the full prevention season for RSV, which is 5 to 6 months. We're a single fixed dose, not a weight-based administered shot. So for us, those are all very important things.And the last thing I'd note is the site of action for us is really, we think, has low risk of development of resistance and is different than the competition. So we actually are very bullish on this. I think we don't talk about it, frankly, because we have so many other good things to talk about. It sometimes gets lost. But it doesn't mean we're not excited about this and/or dengue, which frankly, I still believe dengue is a little bit, obviously, later than this but huge for us. So those are things we're excited about. It just reinforces the breadth of the portfolio we have."", 'Operator', ""Next, we'll go to the line of Chris Shibutani from Goldman Sachs."", 'Chris Shibutani', ""If I could ask about immunology, essentially a reentry into that realm with the Prometheus acquisition. If you could just update us on what we should be expecting to learn and also what you find interesting perhaps being to further build out on the immunology platform. Specifically, the clinicaltrials.gov has the Phase II maintenance data in UC is enrolling. Should we expect to hear from you on results there?I did not observe something there on Crohn's disease. What's the update on that program? And then in immunology further, it appeared from the start of the year a lot of excitement about different modalities, cell therapies in particular, oral advanced treatments. Share with us some views on where you think immunology could go to take Merck to be a relevant presence in the 2030s."", 'Dean Y. Li', ""Chris, that's a great question and an expansive question. So let me just hit in relationship to the TL1A antibody. We have our ulcerative colitis trial moving forward, and that's been listed and that's moving forward.I think probably the really important thing for me that I look out is getting the Crohn's disease trial moving. The reason I think it's really important is I'll remind myself that TL1A is in the super TNF family. But TL1A may be different than run-of-the-mill TNF in its ability to not just dampen inflammation but affect fibrosis.So going from ulcerative colitis to Crohn's disease, Crohn's disease has lots of strictures in this. That will be important. And it will be also important to look and follow -- I follow our data in TL1A in relationship to lung disease and scleroderma. So that's with that.I would also emphasize that there are other assets within the partnership or acquisition that we did with Prometheus and those compounds, which had already been discussed previously, are advancing through the pipeline as well.And then the other question that you have is, are we interested in other platforms moving forward? The answer is absolutely yes. I think you had a question in terms of cell therapy with immunology. I think there is interesting there. But as you know, we've -- when we've looked at cell therapy in relationship to cancer, especially not in heme, but in solid, we've been a little bit probably more exploratory. And right now, our view of cell therapy in immunology is one that might be more similar to our view of cell therapy in solid tumor, a little bit more exploratory."", 'Operator', ""And for our final question, we'll go to the line of Louise Chen from Cantor Fitzgerald."", 'Louise Alesandra Chen', 'I just wanted to ask you on your ADC platform, if you feel that what you have is enough for now or do you want to expand or add on to it. And any interest in radiopharmaceuticals?', 'Dean Y. Li', ""Thank you very much for that question. So when we think about tissue targeting, we think of ADCs. And the answer is, I think the ADC fields will continue to develop, and I think there will be other payloads, other linkers, but also the specificity by which you do the tissue targeting in relationship to the antibody may change.There's also clearly evidence of potential movements into peptide drug conjugates that we're interested in as well as the possibility that the payload is no longer chemotherapy-based, but other sort of compound-based. So we're interested in that.In tissue targeting more broadly, we are interested. And so we view that as, okay, that's how we're going to move sort of toxic cell chemotherapy agents into tissue targeting sort of scheme making chemotherapy precision medicine. But we also are very interested in the IO space in relationship to tissue targeting, and that is -- our foray in that is really helped by our proposed acquisition with Harpoon that has a very interesting asset in relationship to tissue targeting and immune engagers."", 'Peter Dannenbaum', ""Great. Thank you, Louise, and thank you all for the really good questions and appreciate you sticking to mostly one question. We got through a lot of questioners, so appreciate that. If you have any follow-ups, please reach out to IR. We'll be seeing you soon. Thank you."", 'Operator', ""Thank you all for participating in the Merck & Co. Q4 Sales and Earnings Conference Call. That concludes today's conference. Please disconnect at this time, and have a great rest of your day.""]"

Last year, Pfizer has responded to concerns related to its COVID-19 products being the rearview mirror with a cost-cutting program, internal restructuring and by getting deeper into oncology with its purchase of cancer drugmaker Seagen. Treating and preventing cancer is the one battle the pharmaceutical industry has not won, but last year, Pfizer, along with Moderna Inc (NASDAQ: MRNA) and smaller players like Mainz Biomed N.V. (NASDAQ: MYNZ) gave hope that this could change with their intense efforts.', 'The New-York based drugmaker reported its\xa0revenue tumbled more than 41% to $14.25 billion,\xa0coming short of Wall Street estimates of $14.42 billion.\xa0Covid vaccine dragged revenue down as it tanked as much as 53% YoY $5.36 billion. Throughout 2023,\xa0COVID products, the Paxlovid antiviral treatment and vaccine Comirnaty, jointly brought in $12.5 billion which means Pfizer met its target, but this is a far cry from 2022’s $57 billion.', 'Pfizer made a net loss of $3.37 billion or\xa060 cents per share\xa0but adjusted earnings amounted to\xa010 cents, topping the 22 cents loss that LSEG estimated.', 'On a brighter note, while restructuring and acquisition costs ballooned 222%, Pfizer did a good job in lowering total expenses as it also slashed R&D by\xa022% to $2.82 billion which helped its results.', ""Pfizer guided for 2024 revenue growth in a range that is flat to up 5%, with revenue in the range between $58.5 billion and $61.5 billion, maintaining its adjusted earnings forecast in the range between $2.05 and $2.25 per share.\xa0Also,\xa0Pfizer said it's on track to deliver $4 billion in annual net cost savings by the end of this year as part of its cost realignment plan, which is even better than its original goal of $3.5 billion."", 'While Pfizer gets to\xa0celebrate its 175th anniversary this year,\xa0it didn’t get under the spotlight before the Covid-19 pandemic. It made history with its blockbuster vaccine so here’s to hoping it also delivers its promise to treat cancer at that same speed of science.\xa0Unfortunately, its attempt to take part in the booming weight loss drug market got shattered last month as it\xa0eliminated its twice-daily\xa0experimental weight loss pill due to patients having trouble tolerating the drug in a midstage clinical study, although they lost significant weight.', 'Another concern for Pfizer is that its blockbuster drugs like blood thinner Eliquis and cancer drug Ibrance will be losing their exclusivity later this decade, with losses estimated to be about $17 billion in lost revenue from 2025 to 2030. But the good news is that drug launches should bring back Pfizer into the game and to growth. Pfizer is expecting its new drugs to bring in $20 billion in revenue by the end of the decade with new business deals also bringing in $25 billion in revenue during the same timeframe.', 'Therefore, if its cancer treatment bet goes through, the worst seems to be over for Pfizer.', 'At the end of 2023, Moderna succeeded to overshadow weak Covid-19 vaccine sales with optimistic news on the skin cancer vaccine and the combined treatment it developed with Merck & Co Inc (NYSE: MRK). New data showed that mRNA technology-powered Moderna vaccine combined with the blockbuster drug Keytruda from Merck lowered the risk of late-stage skin cancer returning after three years by as much as 49%, suggesting that the benefits of this combined treatment held up. Moderna expects its personalized mRNA vaccine that is designed to prevent cancer to come back to be available already in 2025. With Keytruda, Merck just topped both top and bottom-line estimates for the fourth quarter. The cancer drug alone boosted Merck’s revenue by as much as 21% YoY. Merck also guided for strong annual profit on the back of continued Keytruda momentum.', 'A molecular genetics diagnostic company specializing in the early detection of cancer,\xa0Mainz Biomed also made its mark last year when it comes to colorectal cancer. With its flagship product,\xa0ColoAlert® ,\xa0easy-to-use screening test,\xa0The eAArly DETECT U.S. study results reported a sensitivity for colorectal cancer of 97% with a specificity of 97% and a sensitivity for advanced adenoma of 82%, confirming results from its prior European study ColoFuture. These studies also assessed the potential of mRNA technology as Mainz Biomed integrated a portfolio of novel gene expression (mRNA) biomarkers\xa0into the test. With this innovative move, Mainz Biomed did not only achieve a fantastic accuracy for detecting CRC, but also advanced adenoma which is a well-known CRC precursor. It is a widely-known fact how important early detection is for the ultimate outcome of cancer treatment, but with its work, Mainz Biomed opened the door for something no one ever did until now- prevent cancer, CRC that is, by detecting a state that precedes it.', 'All in all, pharma companies, both big and small, have set their eyes on beating cancer this year.', 'DISCLAIMER: This content is for informational purposes only.

If you want to skip the latest stock market news, then you can take a look at the 5 Blue-Chip Stocks At 52-Week Lows. ', 'The end of January has provided the media and investors with crucial information from the Federal Reserve just in time to set expectations of what to expect from the market and the economy moving forward. 2024 is an important year not only in finance but also in politics due to the upcoming presidential election. At the same time, interest rates are at multi-year highs, tightening financial conditions and creating a restrictive environment that increases the possibility of stressing business operations.', 'These stressors were visible during the bank earnings cycle of Q4 2023. In fact, the first month of 2024 is ominously similar to what happened in March 2023. Back then, rapid interest rate hikes by the Federal Reserve coupled with imprudent financial planning led to a string of successive bank failures on Wall Street. Some of the biggest banks in the U.S. were left unable to meet their depositor requirements, and for a while, government officials, analysts, hedge fund managers, executives, economists, and others were left wondering whether the contagion could spread to mega banks such as JPMorgan Chase & Co. (NYSE:JPM) and Bank of America Corporation (NYSE:BAC).', ""Now, another regional bank is creating quite a bit of turmoil in the banking sector. New York Community Bancorp, Inc. (NYSE:NYCB)'s shares are down by a painful 37% for their worst drop in history. The plummet followed the bank's announcement that it lost $252 million in the fourth quarter. It also expects high credit losses in 2024, while it also announced a shocking 71% dividend cut fueled by the need to shore up its balance sheet to maintain regulatory status."", ""The fall in New York Community Bancorp's shares shows how small firms are more vulnerable to economic headwinds than large firms. This is also why during turbulent economic times, particularly like those in 2022 and 2020, investors often flock to the stability of large cap stocks. After its record setting share price drop, NYCB is worth a modest $4.67 billion which classifies it as a mid cap stock. Stocks that have a market capitalization greater than $10 billion are classified as large cap stocks, and they are followed by the rare bunch of firms called mega caps which are worth at least $200 billion."", ""Subsequently, large cap stocks are often sizeable companies with robust balance sheets that provide management, employees, and investors with comfort in their ability to weather out most economic storms. This might be important considering that perhaps the most important financial report for January 2024 has come in the form of the Federal Reserve's latest decision for interest rates."", ""In its latest meeting, the central bank decided to keep interest rates at current levels after it shared that while inflation has dropped, it remains high enough to keep the monetary environment in restrictive territory. The Fed's announcement came as even big tech mega cap stocks failed to maintain their footing in an economy that's growing but seeing tight capital conditions that managers have not had to account for in years. Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL), one of the technology industry's eminent players when it comes to artificial intelligence warned that costs would prove to be higher than what many would have liked them to be."", 'Fed Chair Jerome Powell stated at the post policy announcement press conference that his organization would ""need to see continuing evidence to build confidence that inflation is moving down sustainably toward our goal"" of 2% before it can feel comfortable to tinker with the monetary policy. The Fed\'s top official was also content with the labor market\'s performance as he shared that labor demand and supply seemed to be stabilizing and wage growth had also started to moderate. Inflation and the labor market performance are the two key areas of monetary policy that the Federal Reserve has to moderate, and their performance provides analysts and investors with the first set of the proverbial tea leaves when it comes to understanding future stock market and economic performance.', 'Chair Powell went on to add:', 'We believe that our policy rate is likely at its peak for this tightening cycle and that, if the economy evolves broadly as expected, it will likely be appropriate to begin dialing back policy restraint at some point this year. But the economy has surprised forecasters in many ways since the pandemic, and ongoing progress toward our 2 percent inflation objective is not assured. The economic outlook is uncertain, and we remain highly attentive to inflation risks. We are prepared to maintain the current target range for the federal funds rate for longer, if appropriate.', 'As labor market tightness has eased and progress on inflation has continued, the risks to achieving our employment and inflation goals are moving into better balance. We know that reducing policy restraint too soon or too much could result in a reversal of the progress we have seen on inflation and ultimately require even tighter policy to get inflation back to 2 percent. At the same time, reducing policy restraint too late or too little could unduly weaken economic activity and employment. In considering any adjustments to the target range for the federal funds rate, the Committee will carefully assess the incoming data, the evolving outlook, and the balance of risks. The Committee does not expect it will be appropriate to reduce the target range until it has gained greater confidence that inflation is moving sustainably toward 2 percent.

If you want to skip the latest stock market news, then you can take a look at the 5 Blue-Chip Stocks At 52-Week Lows. ', 'The end of January has provided the media and investors with crucial information from the Federal Reserve just in time to set expectations of what to expect from the market and the economy moving forward. 2024 is an important year not only in finance but also in politics due to the upcoming presidential election. At the same time, interest rates are at multi-year highs, tightening financial conditions and creating a restrictive environment that increases the possibility of stressing business operations.', 'These stressors were visible during the bank earnings cycle of Q4 2023. In fact, the first month of 2024 is ominously similar to what happened in March 2023. Back then, rapid interest rate hikes by the Federal Reserve coupled with imprudent financial planning led to a string of successive bank failures on Wall Street. Some of the biggest banks in the U.S. were left unable to meet their depositor requirements, and for a while, government officials, analysts, hedge fund managers, executives, economists, and others were left wondering whether the contagion could spread to mega banks such as JPMorgan Chase & Co. (NYSE:JPM) and Bank of America Corporation (NYSE:BAC).', ""Now, another regional bank is creating quite a bit of turmoil in the banking sector. New York Community Bancorp, Inc. (NYSE:NYCB)'s shares are down by a painful 37% for their worst drop in history. The plummet followed the bank's announcement that it lost $252 million in the fourth quarter. It also expects high credit losses in 2024, while it also announced a shocking 71% dividend cut fueled by the need to shore up its balance sheet to maintain regulatory status."", ""The fall in New York Community Bancorp's shares shows how small firms are more vulnerable to economic headwinds than large firms. This is also why during turbulent economic times, particularly like those in 2022 and 2020, investors often flock to the stability of large cap stocks. After its record setting share price drop, NYCB is worth a modest $4.67 billion which classifies it as a mid cap stock. Stocks that have a market capitalization greater than $10 billion are classified as large cap stocks, and they are followed by the rare bunch of firms called mega caps which are worth at least $200 billion."", ""Subsequently, large cap stocks are often sizeable companies with robust balance sheets that provide management, employees, and investors with comfort in their ability to weather out most economic storms. This might be important considering that perhaps the most important financial report for January 2024 has come in the form of the Federal Reserve's latest decision for interest rates."", ""In its latest meeting, the central bank decided to keep interest rates at current levels after it shared that while inflation has dropped, it remains high enough to keep the monetary environment in restrictive territory. The Fed's announcement came as even big tech mega cap stocks failed to maintain their footing in an economy that's growing but seeing tight capital conditions that managers have not had to account for in years. Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL), one of the technology industry's eminent players when it comes to artificial intelligence warned that costs would prove to be higher than what many would have liked them to be."", 'Fed Chair Jerome Powell stated at the post policy announcement press conference that his organization would ""need to see continuing evidence to build confidence that inflation is moving down sustainably toward our goal"" of 2% before it can feel comfortable to tinker with the monetary policy. The Fed\'s top official was also content with the labor market\'s performance as he shared that labor demand and supply seemed to be stabilizing and wage growth had also started to moderate. Inflation and the labor market performance are the two key areas of monetary policy that the Federal Reserve has to moderate, and their performance provides analysts and investors with the first set of the proverbial tea leaves when it comes to understanding future stock market and economic performance.', 'Chair Powell went on to add:', 'We believe that our policy rate is likely at its peak for this tightening cycle and that, if the economy evolves broadly as expected, it will likely be appropriate to begin dialing back policy restraint at some point this year. But the economy has surprised forecasters in many ways since the pandemic, and ongoing progress toward our 2 percent inflation objective is not assured. The economic outlook is uncertain, and we remain highly attentive to inflation risks. We are prepared to maintain the current target range for the federal funds rate for longer, if appropriate.', 'As labor market tightness has eased and progress on inflation has continued, the risks to achieving our employment and inflation goals are moving into better balance. We know that reducing policy restraint too soon or too much could result in a reversal of the progress we have seen on inflation and ultimately require even tighter policy to get inflation back to 2 percent. At the same time, reducing policy restraint too late or too little could unduly weaken economic activity and employment. In considering any adjustments to the target range for the federal funds rate, the Committee will carefully assess the incoming data, the evolving outlook, and the balance of risks. The Committee does not expect it will be appropriate to reduce the target range until it has gained greater confidence that inflation is moving sustainably toward 2 percent. We will continue to make our decisions meeting by meeting.', ""With these details in mind, let's take a look at some blue chip stocks that are trading at 52 week lows.

Now, I will turn the call over to Dave Calhoun."", ""Dave Calhoun: Thank you, Matt. Good morning everybody and thanks for joining us. While we report on our fourth quarter results today, my focus is on Alaska Airlines Flight 1282 and the actions we are taking as a company that strengthen quality and earn the confidence of our customers, the confidence of our regulators, and the flying public. Brian will cover the financials. I will keep my comments strictly to the issue at hand. I'll start upfront by apologizing again to Alaska Airlines, to their crew and to their passengers and more broadly, to all of our customers who were affected by the 737 MAX 9 grounding. The NTSB's investigation into the accident is ongoing. I have an amazing amount of confidence in the work that they do."", ""They bring experts to the investigation. And they take all the time that's necessary to draw accurate conclusions, and we intend to be there with them. As part of that NTSB process, I cannot comment on any specific root cause or speculate a root cause. As a participant in the process, I do believe the investigation will narrow quickly. Whatever conclusions are reached, Boeing is accountable for what happened. Whatever the specific cause of the accident might turn out to be, an event like this simply must not happen on an airplane that leaves one of other factories. We simply must be better. Our customers deserve better. I want to remind everybody what a great job the pilots and the crew at Alaska Airlines did in responding to a desperate moment."", ""I also want to remind everybody what a terrific job the leadership at Alaska Airlines did, grounding the airplanes and ensuring safety. Alaska Airlines did exactly what companies like Boeing would hope that they do at a moment like that and that is why the airline industry is as safe as it is. We caused the problem, and we understand that. Over these last few weeks, I've had tough conversations with our customers, with our regulators, congressional leaders and more. We understand why they are angry, and we will work to earn their confidence. There is no message, no slogan that will accomplish that. It's all about real, demonstrated action and absolute transparency every step of the way. So, let's talk about those steps. Our team has worked diligently to help our customers restore their 737-9 airplanes to service."", 'The FAA approved the detailed inspection protocol last Wednesday. And today, all 737-9 operators are safely returning their airplanes in service. More broadly, we are taking immediate and comprehensive actions to strengthen quality of Boeing and within our supply chain. We instituted additional quality controls and inspections at Boeing and at our supplier. We issued bulletins to suppliers to strengthen the focus on conformance and reducing the risks of quality escapes. We opened our factories to 737 operators for additional direct oversight and we appointed an expert quality adviser to conduct a comprehensive and independent review of our commercial airplane quality management system, and they will remain with us for many years. Most importantly, last week, we paused 737 production for the day as more than 10,000 teammates across Renton, Seattle, and Moses Lake stopped to focus on safety and quality and only safety and quality.', ""This was a quality stand-down at a scale we have never done before, and we're going to keep doing them across our commercial factories. In addition to our internal actions, the FAA has announced new oversight of our 737 manufacturing. We will cooperate fully and transparently with the FAA at every turn. We respect their role as our regulator, and we will follow their direction in every step on production. Today, we're producing 737s at a rate of 38 per month and we will remain at that rate until the FAA and Boeing is satisfied with our quality and manufacturing process. This increased scrutiny, whether it comes from us, from our regulator or from third-parties, will make us better. It's that simple. Over the last several years, we've taken close care not to push the system too fast."", 'And we have never hesitated to slow down, to hold production or to stop deliveries to take the time we need to get things right. Nobody knows that better than our investors. As you know, we stopped delivering 787s for over a year to ensure that each conform to our exacting specifications prior to delivery. And on the 737 line, we have regularly slowed rate breaks to support the stability of the overall production system and to correct non-conformances when identified. But this actually makes it absolutely clear we have more work to do. I know that these moments that impact delivery schedules can frustrate our customers and our investors. But quality and safety must come above all else. And our customers and our investors know that and are in there with us.', ""On that note, as you will see, we are not issuing financial outlook for 2024 today. Now is not the time for that. We won't predict timing. We won't get ahead of our regulator. We will go slow to go fast. And we will encourage and reward employees for speaking up to slow things down if that's what's needed. We will simply focus on every next airplane and ensuring we meet all the standards that we have, all the standards that our regulator has and that our customers demand. As we go about that work, we remain confident in our recovery. Since day one, we've been focused squarely on inculcating safety and quality to everything that we do and getting back to our legacy of having engineering excellence at the center of our business. That focus and commitment is unwavering."", ""And we will continue to strengthen our processes and our execution every step of the way. Most importantly, we will be transparent every step of the way. And with our 170,000 employees in mind, I'd like to close with a message directly to our team. We have confidence in you, and we have confidence in Boeing. We have confidence in our airplanes. I know how seriously you take your work. Our men and women on the manufacturing floor and in our engineering offices know exactly what we must do. You know your work better than anyone else on the planet. Use your voice, speak up, focus on every next detail. We will seek out and act on your feedback. We're in a challenging moment. We will earn trust back through demonstrated action and a commitment to total transparency."", ""I'm confident in you, I'm confident in our company and that together, we will do just that. Brian, over to you."", ""Brian West: Thanks Dave and good morning everyone. Let's start off with the total company financial performance for the quarter. Revenue was $22 billion. That's up 10% year-over-year. Growth was driven by higher commercial volume and favorable mix. The core loss per share was $0.47, better than last year primarily on improved commercial volume, better mix and lower abnormal costs. They were offset by lower defense margins and higher period expenses, including R&D, which we expected. Free cash flow was $3 billion in the quarter, in line with the prior year and up sequentially from the third quarter primarily due to improved commercial deliveries and strong order activity, which show favorable advanced payment timing, some of which was anticipated in the first quarter of 2024."", ""Turning to the next page, I'll cover Boeing Commercial Airplanes. BCA booked 611 net orders in the quarter with 411 737s, including an order with Akasa, 98 777Xs largely an Emirates order and 83 787s. We have over 5,600 airplanes in backlog valued at $441 billion. BCA delivered 157 airplanes in the quarter and revenue was $10.5 billion. That's up 13% driven by higher widebody deliveries and favorable mix. Operating margin was just positive at 0.4%, driven by returning to normal 737 delivery levels in the quarter, improved mix as well as lower abnormal costs associated with getting to five per month on the 87 and resuming production on the 777X. Now, I'll give more color on the key programs. On the 737, we delivered 110 airplanes in the quarter and 45 in December."", ""The program also began FAA certification flight testing on the 737-10 in December. For the year, we delivered 396 airplanes, on the upper end of the revised guidance range we provided in October. Per the FAA announcement, we'll maintain production at 38 per month and work transparently with the FAA to complete all requirements for future increases. At the same time, we'll continue to prioritize the master schedule to avoid disruption in our supply chain. On the 737-9, we're actively supporting our customers' return to service activities. And as of today, the majority are back flying. In our factory, we have 10 -9s in production, all of which will undergo the FAA group inspection process prior to delivery. Spirit has also adopted this inspection routine in its factory."", ""The quarter ended with about 200 MAX airplanes in inventory. It's important to think about this inventory in three buckets. First, there are 140 737-8s built prior to 2023. The vast majority are for customers in China and India. We still expect to deliver most of these airplanes by year-end as we work towards shutting down the shadow factory. In the second bucket, there are around 25 airplanes produced in 2023 that are still in WIP, given the disruptions in the second half of last year. And we expect these to deliver in 2024. And lastly, there are approximately 35 -7 to -10s that we will deliver once those airplanes are certified, the timing of which will be determined by the FAA. Moving on to the 787. We delivered 23 airplanes in the quarter, including 11 in December."", 'For the year, we delivered 73 airplanes, within the guidance range we originally outlined for 2023. The program successfully transitioned production to five per month in the quarter and still plan to steadily work our way to 10 per month in the 2025, 2026 timeframe. We ended the quarter with approximately 60 airplanes in inventory, about 50 of which require rework, which continues to progress steadily. We still expect to deliver most of these airplanes by year-end as we finish the rework and shut down the shadow factory. We booked $77 million of abnormal costs in the quarter and have approximately $300 million left to go that will wind down by year-end, in line with our expectations. On the 777X, we resumed production in the quarter and continue to progress along the program timeline, which remains unchanged.', 'During the quarter, the Emirates order for 90 777Xs brought the program backlog to more than 400 airplanes and also extended the accounting quantity. We continue to follow the lead of the FAA as we progress through the certification process, including working to obtain approval from the FAA to begin certification flight testing. We booked $71 million of abnormal costs in the quarter, which is now fully behind us after resuming production, in line with our expectations. Moving to the next page, Boeing Defense and Space. BDS booked $8 billion in orders during the quarter, including the Lot 10 Award from the US Air Force for 15 KC-46A Tankers. The backlog is now at $59 billion. Revenue was $6.7 billion, up 9% on the tanker award and improved volume and BDS delivered 52 aircraft and two satellites in the quarter.', 'Operating margin was minus 1.5% in the quarter, a sequential improvement from 3Q, but still we have more work to do. 4Q results were impacted by cost true-ups on three fixed-price development programs totaling $139 million as well as unfavorable performance and mix on other programs. Our game plan to get BDS back to high single-digit margins by the 2025-2026 timeframe remains unchanged. Our core business remains solid, representing 60% of our revenue and performing in the mid to high single-digit margin range. The demand for these products is very strong and we need to execute, compete and grow these offerings. On the 25% of the portfolio primarily comprised of fighter and satellite programs, operational performance stabilized as we exit the year.', 'And as a result, the fourth quarter saw improved margin trends, although still negative. We still expect to return to the strong historical performance levels as we roll out new contracts with tighter underwriting disciplines as we move into the 2025-2026 timeframe. Lastly, we have our fixed-price development programs that represent the remaining 15% of revenue. Despite the relatively modest cost trips [ph] in the quarter, we continue to focus on maturing these programs and retiring risks quarter in, quarter out. And we made some good progress in the fourth quarter. In addition to capturing the tanker award from the US Air Force, the program delivered nine aircraft in the fourth quarter, continuing to build positive momentum in spite of the supply-related disruptions to the factory that we faced earlier last year.', ""And on the T-7A, the first Red Hawk arrived at Edwards Air Force Base in November, formally starting the Air Force development flight test campaign for the aircraft. Overall, the defense portfolio is poised to improve. The strong demand across the customer base, the products are performing in the field, and we're confident that our efforts to drive execution and stability will return this business to performance levels that our investors recognize. Moving now to the next page, Boeing Global Services. BGS had another strong quarter. They received $6 billion in orders and the backlog is now at $20 billion. Revenue was $4.8 billion, up 6% primarily on favorable commercial volume and mix. Operating margins were a very strong 17.4%, an expansion of 350 basis points versus last year as both our commercial and government businesses were delivering double-digit margins."", ""In the quarter, BGS opened a parts distribution center in India and received a follow-on contract to provide sustainment for the C-17. Turning now to the next page, I'll cover cash and debt. On cash and marketable securities, we ended the quarter at $16 billion. On debt, the balance remained flat at $52.3 billion and over the next few days, we'll pay down $4 billion of the $5 billion of maturities coming due this year from our available cash on hand. We continue to maintain access to $10 billion of revolving credit facilities, all of which remain undrawn. Our liquidity position remains strong. Our investment-grade credit rating continues to be a priority. And we're developing -- deploying capital in line with the portage [ph] we've shared previously: invest in the business and pay down debt."", ""Turning to the next page, I'll cover our full year financials. Full year revenue was $77.8 billion, up 17% year-over-year. Growth was driven by improved commercial volume primarily on higher 787 deliveries. The core loss per share was $5.81, better than prior year primarily on improved commercial volume and mix as well as lower fixed price development charges in defense. Free cash flow was $4.4 billion for the year, up versus prior year primarily on higher 787 deliveries and favorable receipt timing that was partially offset by higher expenditures as we increase production rates and invest in the business. While we're postponing issuing 2024 guidance today, given our current focus, we're committed to sharing timely and transparent updates moving forward."", ""I would like to provide some additional context on our path forward. We always knew 2024 was going to be an important year in our recovery. Based on what we know today, we expect another steady year of free cash flow, driven by the 737 production at 38 per month, ongoing execution of the 787 toward our long-term objectives, continued liquidation of our 737 and 787 inventory, and continued focus to wind down both shadow factories. Our defense business will continue to improve as we mature fixed-price programs and transition recently challenged programs with better underwriting disciplines that we've already started to see and BGS will continue to generate strong free cash flow. Longer term, we're focused on quality and stability, which will ultimately drive free cash flow."", ""Nothing has changed on the demand front, and the backlog is strong and growing. Remember, our 2025-2026 guidance was based on achieving stability and we have to earn that by applying resources to fix our issues and demonstrate predictability one airplane at a time, side-by-side with our regulator. This team is up to the challenge, and we'll apply any and all resources to get back to deliveries that satisfy our customers and underwrite the long-term demand profile. We're still confident in the goals we laid out for 2025-2026 although it may take longer in that window than originally anticipated, and we won't rush the system. With that, I'll turn it back to Dave for closing comments."", ""Dave Calhoun: Yes. Thanks Brian. We're addressing you from Renton, home of 737 MAX family. We're living in the here and now, and we're working with all of our people and I couldn't be more impressed with their commitment, dedication and the comprehensive nature around which they will look at this. Boeing will get better. I am confident in that. We will address everything that needs to be learned from the accident, and we'll move forward. So, thanks.

Now, Skyworks stock is finally gearing up for a bull run with the demand environment continuing to show improvements, as evident from the company’s Q1-2024 earnings released on January 30. I am bullish on Skyworks, as I believe the company is attractively valued at a time when its prospects are improving.', 'For the first quarter of Fiscal 2024, Skyworks reported revenue of $1.2 billion and earnings per share of $1.97. The company generated record operating cash flows of $775 million for the quarter and record free cash flows of $753 million. These achievements came on the back of a near-10% year-over-year decline in revenue, highlighting the noteworthy efficiency improvements booked by the company to start the new Fiscal year on the right foot.', 'Skyworks is booking efficiency gains at a time when the semiconductor sector is beginning to turn a corner. This is encouraging news for investors.', 'According to Gartner (NYSE:IT), global semiconductor revenue declined by 11% in 2023 due to an inventory glut that stemmed from waning demand for high-performance chips. However, inventory levels are expected to normalize this year, paving the way for chip manufacturers to convert the surging demand for chips into financial gains. Gartner predicts global semiconductor revenue to grow by 17% this year to $624 billion.', 'During the Q1 earnings call, Skyworks CEO Liam Griffin confirmed the ongoing recovery in demand and highlighted the stabilizing demand environment across Android ecosystems. The CEO went on to claim that excess supply conditions are abating and that inventory levels at the OEM level are normalizing. These remarks suggest Skyworks will be a beneficiary of the improving prospects for the chip sector this year.', 'Leading Android smartphone manufacturers, including Samsung and Oppo, have struck a bullish stance for 2024, which is good news for Skyworks. Global smartphone shipments declined in both 2022 and 2023, but IDC projects unit shipments to grow by a modest 4% this year, marking the beginning of a new cycle in which smartphone shipments will continue growing through 2027.', 'This improving outlook for the smartphone sector should enable Skyworks to grow in the foreseeable future. Skyworks is one of the leading component suppliers to Android smartphone makers and is also a major supplier of chips to Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL). The Mobile segment accounted for 71% of revenue in Q1, while the Broad Markets segment accounted for the remainder.', 'Apple is the largest customer of Skyworks and generally accounts for more than half of its revenue. This high concentration on one customer increases the business risk for the company, but so far, Skyworks has managed this risk commendably by emerging as an indispensable partner of Apple that produces advanced chips with high radio frequency content. In the 5G era, smartphone manufacturers are trying to partner with chip companies with proven experience in delivering high-quality components, and Skyworks is one.', 'Skyworks Solutions is investing in its future by focusing on strategic investments in product development to position the company to secure more design wins in key market segments. The company continues to look for value-accretive partnerships as well. Examples of recent deals include the expansion of its WiFi design pipeline with key partners such as Cisco Systems (NASDAQ:CSCO), Linksys, and TP-link.', 'Skyworks is investing in next-generation wireless standards such as WiFI 6E and 7 as well, which should enable the company to play a critical role in the ongoing upgrade cycle.', 'In a bid to diversify revenue sources, Skyworks is actively expanding into new market segments, which is another promising sign. In Q1, the company secured several design wins in the infrastructure development sector, including optical transport products for a leading, undisclosed operator in India. The company also reported a few design wins in the automotive sector, covering telematics, infotainment systems, and onboard chargers with a few OEMs.', 'Skyworks may face some pressure if Apple iPhone sales lose some steam in 2024 amid inflationary pressures. Plus, Wall Street analysts seem divided on the prospects for the company.', 'For instance, on January 10, BMO Capital Markets identified Skyworks as a best-in-class growth company trading at a reasonable valuation in addition to 24 other tech companies. According to BMO (NYSE:BMO), these 25 companies could outperform the broad market this year, even if the momentum behind tech stocks loses some strength.', 'KeyBank Capital Markets, however, struck a cautious stance for Apple’s key suppliers, as the research firm believes demand for Apple devices will not be impressive in 2024.', 'Overall, based on the rating of 23 Wall Street analysts, SWKS stock comes in as a Moderate Buy. The average Skyworks stock price target is $111.68, which implies upside of 8.5% from the current market price.', 'Despite the seemingly limited upside potential based on Wall Street rankings, Skyworks stock seems well-positioned to turn a corner this year, aided by the improving demand environment for the semiconductor sector.', 'Skyworks Solutions, at a forward P/E of 14.8, looks cheaply valued at a time when the chip sector is setting up for a breakout after two consecutive years of disappointing performance. For context, during the previous up-cycle in 2019 and 2020, Skyworks traded at average P/E multiples of close to 20. With the chip sector turning a corner today, it seems reasonable to expect Skyworks to enjoy an expansion in valuation multiples this year.', 'The quarterly dividend of 68 cents per share, coupled with stock buybacks, improves the investment appeal of Skyworks further.', 'Skyworks Solutions is nearing an inflection point, with the semiconductor industry projected to register positive growth this year after a disappointing 2023. Skyworks is strategically investing in new products and partnerships to drive earnings growth, and the company seems to be trading at an attractive valuation amid the continued demand stabilization in the chip sector.', 'Disclosure']"

This call is being broadcast live over the web and can be accessed from the Investor Relation section of the company website at skyworksinc.com.

Please refer to our press release within the Investor Relations section of our company website for a complete reconciliation to GAAP. With that, I'll turn the call to Liam."", ""Liam Griffin: Thanks, Raji, and welcome everyone. Skyworks continued to execute well during the first fiscal quarter of 2024 despite a volatile macroeconomic environment. We delivered revenue of $1.202 billion. We posted earnings per share of a $1.97, and generated $775 million of operating cash flow. Free cash flow was also a record at $753 million or a 63% free cash flow margin, which reflects strong working capital management and moderating CapEx intensity. Let's review both near and long-term secular trends in our end markets. After two challenging years across Android ecosystems, we see signs that the industry is stabilizing. Excess supply conditions are abating and inventory levels in the distribution channel and at the OEM level are normalizing."", ""Customers are starting to restock inventory, albeit gradually as supply and demand dynamics improve and new phones are introduced into the market. Moreover, we've made strategic investments in product development, positioning us to compete for design wins and share gains focusing on highly integrated platforms for the leading mobile OEMs. We are pleased with our competitive positioning and technology roadmap and are poised to return to growth when the markets recover. Within broad markets, we see crosscurrents, but many factors are moving in the right direction. In consumer IoT, we believe that we are past the bottom, as inventory levels in the channel have normalized and demand signals are improving. Furthermore, we are executing on the upgrade cycle to WiFi 6E and 7."", 'We see significant design win momentum across our retail, carrier, and enterprise channels. These systems carry substantially higher dollar content, because of the addition of the new 6 gigahertz band and the inclusion of BAW filtering technology. We expect wireless infrastructure and traditional data center will remain a headwind throughout 2024, as OEMs continue to digest excess inventory. Despite this, we remain bullish on several new product cycles, including major design wins in ethernet for high bandwidth networks and 400-gig and 800-gig optical module upgrades. Lastly, automotive and industrial markets are experiencing a near-term inventory correction. However, we see opportunities for growth in our automotive business driven by higher adoption rates of connectivity in the vehicle, along with growing EV penetration, driving demand for our power isolation products.', 'Taken together, we anticipate December quarter represents the bottom in the broad markets business. There are several long-term secular growth dynamics that leverage our differentiated technology, including the proliferation of intelligent edge connected IoT devices, automotive, electrification and advanced safety systems, and AI enabled workloads, driving cloud and data center upgrades. Each of these trends require intricate connectivity engines underlying the need for speed, ultra reliable low latency performance. In addition, 5G technology is expanding beyond the smartphone into more use cases in broad markets, including private cellular networks in factories and stadiums, customer premise equipment supporting Verizon and T-Mobile and multi-band, automotive, telematics, and wearables to name a few.', 'We also remain bullish on the long-term RF content story in smartphones, coupled with growing 5G penetration, we see increasing levels of complexity and content with each new generation. For example, 5G Advanced is driving higher RF content, including the addition of satellite bands 4x4 MIMO on the downlink and uplink, higher bandwidth, more carrier aggregation, upgrades to WiFi and GPS and other innovations. Lastly, we are energized about the prospect of generative AI migrating to the smartphone, sparking a potential major upgrade cycle, as the performance bar rises every year to support AI enabled phones, the complexity requirements of RF will continue to increase driving the need for more integration, lower power consumption, smaller footprint, and spectral efficiency.', ""5G is the ideal standard for on-device AI applications as it takes advantage of lower latency, faster transmission speeds and higher frequency ranges. In addition, AI enabled workloads are driving demand for high speed connectivity for data intensive infrastructure and cloud upgrades, accelerating the demand for our high precision timing products. Turning to our quarterly business highlights, we secured several design wins in infrastructure, including optical transport products with a major operator in India, and timing devices for 5G small cells for private networks. We expanded the WiFi design pipeline with Cisco's enterprise access points, Linksys tri-band mesh router, and TP-link’s tri-band gaming router. We increased design win momentum in automotive, including telematics, infotainment systems, and onboard chargers across the leading OEMs. Lastly, in emerging IoT, we delivered next-generation smart energy solutions with Google's Nest temperature sensors and introns residential gas meters."", ""In summary, Skyworks delivered solid financial results despite a challenging macro environment. Our strong balance sheet, record cash flow and profitability reflect our resilient business model, diverse customer base, and technology scale. With that, I will turn the call over to Kris for discussion of last quarter's performance and our outlook for Q2 of fiscal 2024."", 'Kris Sennesael : Thanks, Liam. Skyworks’ revenue for the first fiscal quarter of 2024 was $1.202 billion, slightly above the midpoint of our outlook. Mobile was approximately 71% of total revenue, an increase of 7% sequentially, as we supported the ramp of new high-performance solutions at our largest customer. Android-related revenue with Google, Samsung and the Chinese OEMs grew modestly sequentially. Broad markets were approximately 29% of total revenue, down 18% sequentially, mostly driven by some specific inventory corrections in wireless infrastructure, automotive and industrial. Gross profit was $557 million, with gross margin at 46.4%, in line with expectations. Gross margin was down 70 basis points sequentially, driven by an unfavorable mix shift, resulting from lower broad markets revenue.', 'Also, during Q1, we reduced our internal inventory by $193 million to $927 million, well below our target of $1 billion. Operating expenses were $191 million, below the low end of the guidance range, given our ongoing focus on managing discretionary expenses, while continuing to invest in our technology and product roadmaps. We generated $366 million of operating income, translating into an operating margin of 30.4%. We incurred $7 million of other expense, and our effective tax rate was 11.7%, driving net income of $317 million and diluted earnings per share of $1.97, which is $0.02 above the guidance that we provided during the last earnings call. Skyworks’ business model continues to generate very strong cash flow. First fiscal quarter cash flow from operations increased to an all-time record of $775 million.', 'Capital expenditures were reduced to $22 million or less than 2% of revenue, resulting in an all-time record free cash flow of $753 million or 63% free cash flow margin. Strong profitability, combined with great working capital management and lowering the CapEx intensity of the business, drove the record cash flow numbers. Also, during fiscal Q1, we paid $109 million in dividends, and repaid the remaining $300 million on our term loan. We ended the quarter with over $1 billion in cash and investments, and $1 billion in debt, creating a net positive cash position, and an optimal capital structure, providing us with superior flexibility and optionality. Now, let’s move on to our outlook for Q2 of fiscal 2024. We anticipate revenue between $1.020 billion to $1.070 billion.', 'We expect our mobile business to be seasonally down, consistent with historical patterns, while in broad markets, we anticipate modest growth off the December bottom, as inventory levels are normalizing in certain end markets. Gross margin is projected to be in the range of 45% to 46%, reflecting our seasonally weakest period of the year. We anticipate margin expansion during the remainder of 2024, benefiting from our disciplined management of our manufacturing and operational cost structure, both internal and external, along with higher factory utilization rates. We will also benefit from a favorable mix shift as our broad markets business recovers and accelerates. We expect operating expenses in the range of $193 million to $197 million as we continue to make strategic investments in mobile and broad markets to drive share gains and increased diversification.', ""Below the line, we anticipate roughly $4 million in other expense and an effective tax rate of 11.5% and a diluted share count of approximately 161 million shares. Accordingly, at the midpoint of the revenue range of $1.045 billion, we intend to deliver diluted earnings per share of $1.52.

The Zacks Banks - Major Regional industry, to which Wells Fargo belongs, has gained 1.9% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?"", ""Although media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision."", 'Revisions to Earnings Estimates', ""Rather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings."", ""We essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements."", 'For the current quarter, Wells Fargo is expected to post earnings of $1.10 per share, indicating a change of -10.6% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -1.4% over the last 30 days.', 'The consensus earnings estimate of $4.72 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of -13.1%. This estimate has changed -2.4% over the last 30 days.', 'For the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $5.30 indicates a change of +12.3% from what Wells Fargo is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has remained unchanged.', ""With an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions.

After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth."", 'In the case of Wells Fargo, the consensus sales estimate of $20.22 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of -2.5%.

Determination of TF expression is not required. Nonclinical data suggest that the anticancer activity of tisotumab vedotin is due to the binding of the ADC to TF-expressing cancer cells, followed by internalization of the ADC-TF complex, and release of MMAE via proteolytic cleavage. MMAE disrupts the microtubule network of actively dividing cells, leading to cell cycle arrest and apoptotic cell death.

Throughout 2023,\xa0COVID products, the Paxlovid antiviral treatment and vaccine Comirnaty, jointly brought in $12.5 billion which means Pfizer met its target, but this is a far cry from 2022’s $57 billion.', 'Pfizer made a net loss of $3.37 billion or\xa060 cents per share\xa0but adjusted earnings amounted to\xa010 cents, topping the 22 cents loss that LSEG estimated.', 'On a brighter note, while restructuring and acquisition costs ballooned 222%, Pfizer did a good job in lowering total expenses as it also slashed R&D by\xa022% to $2.82 billion which helped its results.', ""Pfizer guided for 2024 revenue growth in a range that is flat to up 5%, with revenue in the range between $58.5 billion and $61.5 billion, maintaining its adjusted earnings forecast in the range between $2.05 and $2.25 per share.\xa0Also,\xa0Pfizer said it's on track to deliver $4 billion in annual net cost savings by the end of this year as part of its cost realignment plan, which is even better than its original goal of $3.5 billion."", 'While Pfizer gets to\xa0celebrate its 175th anniversary this year,\xa0it didn’t get under the spotlight before the Covid-19 pandemic. It made history with its blockbuster vaccine so here’s to hoping it also delivers its promise to treat cancer at that same speed of science.\xa0Unfortunately, its attempt to take part in the booming weight loss drug market got shattered last month as it\xa0eliminated its twice-daily\xa0experimental weight loss pill due to patients having trouble tolerating the drug in a midstage clinical study, although they lost significant weight.', 'Another concern for Pfizer is that its blockbuster drugs like blood thinner Eliquis and cancer drug Ibrance will be losing their exclusivity later this decade, with losses estimated to be about $17 billion in lost revenue from 2025 to 2030. But the good news is that drug launches should bring back Pfizer into the game and to growth. Pfizer is expecting its new drugs to bring in $20 billion in revenue by the end of the decade with new business deals also bringing in $25 billion in revenue during the same timeframe.', 'Therefore, if its cancer treatment bet goes through, the worst seems to be over for Pfizer.', 'At the end of 2023, Moderna succeeded to overshadow weak Covid-19 vaccine sales with optimistic news on the skin cancer vaccine and the combined treatment it developed with Merck & Co Inc (NYSE: MRK). New data showed that mRNA technology-powered Moderna vaccine combined with the blockbuster drug Keytruda from Merck lowered the risk of late-stage skin cancer returning after three years by as much as 49%, suggesting that the benefits of this combined treatment held up. Moderna expects its personalized mRNA vaccine that is designed to prevent cancer to come back to be available already in 2025. With Keytruda, Merck just topped both top and bottom-line estimates for the fourth quarter. The cancer drug alone boosted Merck’s revenue by as much as 21% YoY. Merck also guided for strong annual profit on the back of continued Keytruda momentum.', 'A molecular genetics diagnostic company specializing in the early detection of cancer,\xa0Mainz Biomed also made its mark last year when it comes to colorectal cancer. With its flagship product,\xa0ColoAlert® ,\xa0easy-to-use screening test,\xa0The eAArly DETECT U.S. study results reported a sensitivity for colorectal cancer of 97% with a specificity of 97% and a sensitivity for advanced adenoma of 82%, confirming results from its prior European study ColoFuture. These studies also assessed the potential of mRNA technology as Mainz Biomed integrated a portfolio of novel gene expression (mRNA) biomarkers\xa0into the test. With this innovative move, Mainz Biomed did not only achieve a fantastic accuracy for detecting CRC, but also advanced adenoma which is a well-known CRC precursor. It is a widely-known fact how important early detection is for the ultimate outcome of cancer treatment, but with its work, Mainz Biomed opened the door for something no one ever did until now- prevent cancer, CRC that is, by detecting a state that precedes it.', 'All in all, pharma companies, both big and small, have set their eyes on beating cancer this year.', 'DISCLAIMER: This content is for informational purposes only.

On behalf of the Pfizer team, thank you for joining us. This call is being made available via audio webcast at pfizer.com. Earlier this morning, we released our results for the fourth quarter and full-year 2023 via press release that is available on our website at pfizer.com.

Forward-looking statements on the call are subject to substantial risks and uncertainties speak only as of the call's original date and we undertake no obligations to update or revise any of these statements. With that, I will turn the call over to Albert."", ""Albert Bourla: Thank you, Francesca. Good morning, everyone and thank you for joining us. I'm pleased to discuss some of the highlights from the fourth quarter and full-year 2023, and of course, a compelling year we have ahead. I’d like to begin with a few reflections on 2023. As you know, we missed our initial internal projections and Street expectations predominantly related to our COVID products, which affected our stock price performance. Despite however this challenging year, there were a few great things that happened in 2023 that may have gotten lost amidst the mixed expectations. First, in 2023, Pfizer impacted the lives of more than 620 million people approximately around the world. We believe there is no other company that can reach as many people and patients as Pfizer."", 'If you multiply this with our brand equity and awareness, it creates a connection with consumers that can be a very strong asset for us. Second, despite the decline in revenue from our COVID products, as of the reported results for the first nine months of 2023, we were the number 1 pharmaceutical company in terms of revenues from pharma-only products, a marked improvement from our fourth position in 2019. Next, 2023 was a record year for FDA approvals with nine new molecular entity approvals on Pfizer and many more approvals for new indications in already approved products, marking a very productive year of pipeline execution for Pfizer. Finally, we closed the Seagen acquisition. In the current regulatory environment, being able to close such a large acquisition demonstrates our ability to successfully engage with regulatory bodies.', 'Our deliberate and strategic efforts throughout 2023 created a strong foundation to support us. We are now focused on maximizing the opportunities that have positioned us for success and our team is driving confidently as we start 2024. From the advent of penicillin to the development of the COVID-19 vaccine, Pfizer has been at the forefront of medical and pharmaceutical breakthroughs for the past 175 years. This year is our 175th anniversary. That can not only change patient lives but has changed history. Our strategy to continue to build on our proud history of innovation and commercial excellence is supported by the power and strength of our unmatched global scale and footprint, spanning commercial, financial, medical, regulatory, manufacturing and government relations.', ""We have a clear view on how we will deliver operational, commercial and financial success across our business. Our confidence stems from the opportunity we have to bring additional focus to our business by executing five strategic priorities. We will get into each in more detail but the five key priorities for Pfizer this year is here are: First of all, to achieve world-class oncology leadership, to deliver the next wave of pipeline innovation, to maximize the performance of our new products, expand margins by realigning our cost base, allocate capital to enhance shareholder value. I’m confident that Pfizer is well positioned to execute and that we can deliver meaningful value for our patients and our shareholders. Let's start with our first priority which is to achieve a world-class oncology leadership, which I believe we are in a strong position to do."", ""As a reminder, one in three people will be diagnosed with cancer in their lifetime. Oncology represents one of the largest and fastest growing therapeutic areas. Completing the acquisition of Seagen doubled our oncology research and resources overnight, and meaningfully extended the reach and medical impact of our U.S. commercial and medical footprint, with a range of portfolio expansion opportunities boosted by Seagen's broad and deep pipeline. Seagen's in-line medicines are expected to immediately enhance Pfizer's top-line growth, and our combined portfolio provides the opportunity to lead genitourinary cancers and be a leader in breast cancer and deliver at least eight potential blockbuster products by 2030. We look forward to providing more information about our oncology platform at our Pfizer Oncology Innovation Day on February 29."", 'As we build our leadership position, we have multiple potential key oncology catalysts in 2024 that we are acutely focused on. On the commercial side, the PADCEV launch in locally advanced/metastatic bladder cancer in combination with pembrolizumab and XTANDI launch in nonmetastic castration-sensitive prostate cancer. We are excited by the strength of the PADCEV EV-302 data and recent FDA approval, as it represents an opportunity to broaden the reach of this potentially practice-changing, platinum-free regimen to even more patients in the frontline metastatic urothelial cancer setting. Essentially, the recent approval doubles the addressable population, which had already doubled this past spring. We are also looking forward to Phase 3 Data readouts from Vepdegestrant in second line HR+ metastatic breast cancer and Braftovi in first line BRAF colorectal cancer.', ""We also plan to advance our late-stage pipeline with Phase 3 starts of CDK4i in post-CDK4/6 metastatic breast cancer and B6A in non-small cell lung cancer. Building on Pfizer's potential medicines, the pipeline across breast cancer, genitourinary cancer, hematology and CRC, our CDK4 inhibitor could be a compelling follow-on to IBRANCE. And finally, in the early-stage pipeline, we look forward to initiating first-in-patient studies of four new ADC candidates this year, where we believe we have acquired the expertise to be a leader. Our second priority is to deliver the next wave of pipeline innovation with discovery and development across our therapeutic areas outside of Oncology in Vaccines, Anti-Infectives, Internal Medicine Metabolic Diseases, and Inflammation and Immunology."", ""In 2024, we plan to continue to make meaningful investments in R&D. In fact, Pfizer's R&D budget is one of the highest in the industry, and supports our robust pipeline. We are pursuing cutting-edge science across modalities and platforms to deliver the next generation of potential breakthroughs. We are also leveraging AI and other digital tools across the value chain to increase speed and success rates. Starting first with our 4th-generation PCV vaccine candidate, which recently entered the clinic and received FDA Fast Track designation. Building on our deep heritage with PREVNAR, we aim to solidify our leadership in the pneumococcal vaccine space by increasing valency and serotype immunogenicity while maintaining our unique FDA label, which includes both IPD and pneumococcal pneumonia in adults."", 'Respiratory vaccine combinations are another area where we are poised to lead, building upon our successful COVID vaccine. With the first-generation standalone mRNA flu vaccine, data demonstrated superior relatively efficacy versus a recommended flu vaccine in 18-to-64-year-olds, but did not meet success criteria for immunogenicity for the B strains. Our second-generation flu vaccine was tested in a Phase 2 COVID/Flu combination study for 18–64-year-olds and has shown encouraging results in both the A and the B strains. This new construct has now moved already into a Phase 3 COVID/Flu combination trial. Moving next to GBT-601. Our next-generation and potentially best-in-class HbS polymerization inhibitor represents a potential step-wise evolution over Oxbryta for sickle cell disease.', 'Recent data presented at ASH 2023 demonstrated multiple blood parameters approaching normal ranges with treatment, suggesting GBT-601 may have the potential to deliver strong efficacy with the convenience of a once-daily pill. We have reaffirmed our commitment to our emerging cardiometabolic programs, with several early clinical development compounds. On the other end of the weight management spectrum, we have Ponsegromab, our GDF15 neutralizing antibody for cancer cachexia with Phase 2 data expected later this year. Ponsegromab has the potential to be first-in-class and the first FDA-approved treatment for cancer cachexia, which accounts for 20%, 30% of all cancer deaths significantly. Our third priority is of course to maximize the performance of our new products and core franchises through a relentless focus on execution, to continue growing our top-line.', 'To do this, we are prioritizing and focusing, while leveraging data to make changes quickly and adapt. Our Pfizer U.S. Commercial and our Pfizer International Commercial organizations will leverage a more focused, efficient structure to drive executional excellence in their respective markets and expand reach to drive growth over the next several years. To discuss a few examples, we continue to be very enthusiastic about the potential of Nurtec to help the more than one billion people living with migraines worldwide. As access and prescriptions in the U.S. and globally continue to increase, we will continue to focus on direct-to-consumer marketing and reducing barriers to access and affordability for healthcare practitioners and patients. With Oxbryta, we will continue to educate healthcare practitioners and patients on the importance of proactively treating the underlying cause of sickle cell disease by reframing treatment goals to chronic/proactive treatment.', 'With Abrysvo, we are focused on increasing overall RSV market growth and market share by establishing RSV vaccination as a year-round discussion and expanding our retail contracting and offerings. With Elrexfio, we are focused on educating healthcare practitioners in both academic institutions and in the community, awareness building and new patient trialists. Coming off the initial launch of Velsipity, we are focused on helping ensure patient access to Velsipity as a first-line advanced therapy oral option. With Litfulo, we continue to accelerate the consideration of advanced systemic treatments for appropriate alopecia areata patients and further unlock access to Litfulo. In addition, of course, we continue to protect and grow our core franchises and key blockbusters, including Prevnar, Vyndaqel and Eliquis, while exploring further opportunities to advance a number of innovative combination regimens.', 'We believe we are well positioned to bring our global commercial manufacturing and supply capabilities to accelerate current and future marketed products. We believe all these components support our growth potential through 2024 and drive growth potential into 2025. We plan to provide updates throughout the year on how we are advancing these strategic priorities. And with that, I will turn the call over to Dave, who will discuss our financial performance, our initiative to realign our cost base, and our capital allocation strategy to enhance shareholder value. Dave?', ""David Denton : Thank you, Albert, and good morning, everyone. As we enter 2024, we are clearly focused on a small number of critical priorities. These priorities include building a world-class oncology organization, ensuring the next wave of pipeline innovations, maximizing our new product portfolio performance with a more efficient commercial structure, and finally right-sizing our cost base. With that said, I’ll start this morning with our full-year and our fourth quarter results, then I’ll touch on our capital allocation priorities. I'll finish this morning with a few comments on our 2024 guidance and the near-term expectations that set this year as a foundational year to drive our growth potential in the latter half of the decade."", 'For the full-year 2023, we recorded revenues of $58.5 billion, achieving 7% operational growth, solidly in line with our expectations when excluding contributions from both Comirnaty and Paxlovid. The significant sales decline in our COVID products, including a $3.5 billion revenue reversal for Paxlovid, were the primary drivers of an overall 41% operational decrease year-over-year. And with the expectation that Seagen will be a substantial growth contributor in 2024 and beyond, our full-year and fourth quarter results include approximately $120 million in Seagen product revenue after the close of the acquisition on December 14. On the bottom line, we reported full-year 2023 diluted EPS of $0.37 a share, a 93% year-over-year decline, and adjusted diluted earnings per share of $1.84, down 72% versus year-over-year.', 'This decline is primarily due to a significant decrease in sales for both Comirnaty and Paxlovid; the impact of the $3.5 billion revenue reversal for Paxlovid revenues in the fourth quarter related to an expected return of an estimated 6.5 million unused EUA-labeled treatment courses from the U.S. government; and finally a non-cash inventory write-off and other charges of $5.6 billion recorded in the third quarter for Paxlovid and to a lesser extent Comirnaty. Now turning to the quarter, I’d like to highlight that we delivered a solid 8% year-over-year operational revenue growth, again, excluding Comirnaty and Paxlovid. Contributing to this strong performance were our newly approved RSV vaccine as well as Vyndaqel and Eliquis; partially offset by lower revenues for Ibrance and the Prevnar Family.', 'However, our Q4 results, both top and bottom-line, continued to be significantly, and negatively, impacted by our COVID products on a year-on-year basis. Revenues declined 42% operationally, the results were significant decrease in both Comirnaty and Paxlovid sales. Adjusted cost of sales as a percentage of revenues increased by 12 percentage points driven primarily by the $3.5 billion non-cash Paxlovid revenue reversal, and to a much lesser extent, unfavorable changes in sales mix. Overall, our adjusted operating expenses declined 10%, compared to Q4 of last year. Adjusted SI&A expenses increased 1% operationally in the quarter, primarily driven by the timing of marketing and promotional activities, including those related to recently launched and acquired products.', ""And consistent with our strategy, we have been focused on re-prioritizing our R&D spending to enhance overall returns. Adjusted R&D expenses decreased 24% operationally, driven primarily by lower spending across both vaccine programs and certain acquired assets, as well as lower compensation-related expenses. Both our reported diluted loss per share of $0.60 and our adjusted diluted earnings per share of $0.10 for the quarter were negatively impacted by the $3.5 billion Paxlovid revenue reversal, which dampened EPS by approximately $0.54. Continued declines in both Comirnaty and Paxlovid sales also negatively affected our performance in the quarter. Foreign exchange movements had an immaterial impact compared to last year's fourth quarter. As we are increasingly focused on prioritizing our investments to drive forward-looking growth, our GAAP results include a $1.4 billion intangible asset impairment charge associated with etrasimod, based on changes in development plans for additional indications and overall revenue expectations."", 'But I will point out that this product is still projected to contribute over a $1 billion in peak annual sales. Additionally, we recorded a nearly $1 billion intangible asset impairment for Prevnar 13 reflecting a transition to vaccines with higher sero-type coverage. As discussed in prior quarters, our capital allocation strategy is designed to enhance shareholder value and is based on three core pillars. First is growing our dividend. Second is reinvesting in the business. And finally is making share repurchases after de-levering our balance sheet. For 2023, we returned $9.2 billion to shareholders via our quarterly dividend, we have invested $10.7 billion in internal R&D and finally, we have invested approximately $44 billion in completed business development transactions, net of cash acquired, essentially all for the acquisition of Seagen.', ""Our expectation is to maintain and grow our dividend while de-levering our capital structure, with a gross leverage target of 3.25x and a goal to preserve our credit rating and access to Tier 1 commercial paper. Upon achieving our de-levering goals, we anticipate returning to a more balanced capital allocation strategy, inclusive of share repurchases. Now given that we issued our full-year 2024 revenue and adjusted diluted EPS guidance on December 13, let me just hit a few of the highlights. We expect total company full-year '24 revenues to be in the range of $58.5 billion to $61.5 billion, which reflects our expectation of strong contributions across our product portfolio. Importantly, excluding Comirnaty and Paxlovid, we anticipate operational revenue growth of 8%-10%."", 'We remain confident on delivering at least $4 billion of net savings from our cost-realignment program by the end of the year. We believe right sizing the cost base will put us on a strong footing towards margin expansion and increased operational efficiency moving forward. We expect adjusted diluted earnings per share to be in the range of $2.05 to $2.25 a share for the full-year 2024 and as a reminder, this range is inclusive of an anticipated $0.40 of earnings dilution from the Seagen acquisition, and again with the vast majority of this dilution resulting from the financing costs associated with the deal. Cycling into 2024, we have significantly invested in our business to fuel our longer-term growth, and the foundation is set to deliver on our commitments to enhance long-term shareholder value.', ""We are acutely focused on driving near-term performance while solidifying our growth expectations for the back half of the decade. And with that, I'd like to turn it back over to Albert to begin our Q&A session."", ""Albert Bourla: Thank you. With that, let's start the Q&A session.

The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.', ""Thus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only."", 'A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.', 'Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss.

My name is Sheila and I will be your operator for today’s call. [Operator Instructions] Please note that this conference is being recorded. I will now turn the call over to Kristina Kazarian. Kristina, you may begin.', 'Kristina Kazarian: Welcome to Marathon Petroleum’s fourth quarter 2023 earnings conference call. The slides that accompany this call can be found on our website at marathonpetroleum.com under the Investor cab. Joining me on the call today are Mike Hennigan, CEO; Maryann Mannen, President; John Quaid, CFO and other members of the executive team. We invite you to read the Safe Harbor statements on Slide 2. We will be making forward-looking statements today. Actual results could differ. Factors that cause actual results to differ are there as well as in our SEC filings. References to MPC Capital during the prepared remarks today reflects standalone MPC Capital, excluding MPLX. With that, I will turn the call over to Mike.', 'Mike Hennigan: Thanks, Kristina. Good morning, everyone and thank you for joining our call. First, I’d like to recognize some changes we made at our executive management level. Maryann Mannen has been appointed President of MPC. In this role, she will be responsible for our Refining & Marketing, Commercial and HES&S organizations. John Quaid, previously CFO of MPLX succeeds Maryann as CFO of MPC. In addition to these changes, Rick Hessling has been appointed Chief Commercial Officer. Rick will lead our global feedstock and clean products teams with the goal of maximizing margin capture across the entire value chain. Brian Partee has been appointed Chief Global Optimization Officer. Brian will be responsible for assessing and redefining business processes that are critical to improving our performance, including our value chain optimization efforts and determining investments needed to accelerate the delivery of results.', 'At a high level, these organizational changes put more emphasis on advancing important value-creating initiatives, driving increased performance throughout our entire value chain and making a step change in our cash flow generation capability. Turning to our 2023 results. We are pleased to continue to deliver on our strategic commitments. Full year cash provided by operating activities was over $14 billion on a consolidated basis, reflecting our team’s strong execution. Our Refining & Marketing business delivered excellent full year results generating EBITDA of $12.74 per barrel of throughput and capture of 100%. These results reflect strong utilization of our assets and improved execution against our commercial strategy. Incremental to our Refining & Marketing results, our Midstream business posted nearly $6.2 billion of EBITDA.', 'EBITDA for the Midstream segment grew by approximately 7% year-over-year or by approximately $400 million. We expect MPC will receive $2.2 billion of annual cash distributions supported by MPLX’s most recent 10% increase to its quarterly distribution. MPLX is strategic to MPC’s portfolio. Its current pace of cash distributions fully covers MPC’s dividend and more than half of our planned 2024 capital program. We expect MPLX to increase its cash distribution as it pursues growth opportunities further enhancing the value of this strategic relationship. We are committed to returning excess capital to shareholders. In 2023, we returned $11.6 billion through share repurchases, bringing total repurchases to over $29 billion since May of 2021.', 'In addition, we increased MPC’s quarterly dividend by 10% in the fourth quarter. Over the past 5 years, we have grown our quarterly dividend at a compound annual growth rate of over 12%. For the full year 2023, this capital return represents a payout of 92% of our operating cash flow, excluding changes in working capital, highlighting our commitment to superior shareholder returns. Executing on our commitments, combined with a strong macro environment led to total shareholder returns of approximately 31% for MPC in 2023. Turning to our view on the refining macro environment as we head into 2024, global oil demand hit a record high in ‘23 and we see another year of record oil consumption in ‘24. The IEA is currently projecting demand growth of over 1.2 million barrels per day with their projections having been raised higher over the last 3 consecutive months.', 'In our system, both domestically and within our export business, we are seeing steady demand year-over-year for gasoline, diesel and jet fuel. Global supply remains constrained and anticipated global capacity additions have progressed slower than expectations. Gasoline and diesel inventories remained tight globally. And as we look into ‘24, we anticipate that above-average turnaround activity globally in the first quarter as well as the transition to summer gasoline blends will be supportive of refining margins. As we look further into 2024, we believe the U.S. refining industry will experience an enhanced mid-cycle environment due to global supply demand fundamentals and its relative advantages over international sources of supply, including energy costs, feedstock acquisition costs and refinery complexity.', 'Our capital allocation priorities remain unchanged. These include: first, sustaining capital. We remain steadfast in our commitment to safely operate our assets, protect the health and safety of our employees and support the communities in which we operate. Second, our dividend. We are committed to paying a secure, competitive and growing dividend. We intend to evaluate the dividend at least annually. Third, growth capital. We will invest capital, but be disciplined where we believe there are attractive returns, which will enhance our competitiveness and position MPC well into the future. Beyond these three objectives, we will return excess capital through share repurchases to meaningfully lower our share count. From May of ‘21 through January 2024, we reduced our total share count by approximately 45%, repurchasing approximately 300 million shares at an average price of $97.', 'As we execute in 2024, we remain committed to share repurchases as a key component of our capital allocation priorities. MPC’s standalone 2024 capital investment plan, excluding MPLX, totals $1.25 billion. Underpinning our commitment to safety and environmental performance, sustaining capital is approximately 35% of capital spend. In Refining & Marketing, gross spending is down nearly $200 million compared to 2023, reflecting strong capital discipline. In 2024, we are focused on investments that enhance margin and reduce costs. In low carbon, we are investing in an opportunity that offers an attractive return, lowers our cost, increases reliability and reduces emissions. This morning, MPLX also announced its 2024 capital investment plan of $1.1 billion, which is anchored in the Marcellus and Permian basins.', 'At this point, I’d like to turn the call over to Maryann.', 'Maryann Mannen: Thanks Mike. Solid execution of our three strategic pillars remains foundational. We believe the improvements we’ve made to our cost structure, portfolio and commercial execution have driven sustainable structural benefits, irrespective of the market environment. We will continue to build on this strong foundation to recognize value throughout our business. Our refining utilization in 2023 was 92% as we operated our portfolio to meet consumer demand. Recently, we have said we believe our average capture over longer periods of time is approaching 100%. And in 2023, our full year capture was 100%. This commitment to commercial excellence is foundational and we expect to continue to see these results. While our capture results will fluctuate based on market dynamics, we believe that the capabilities we have built over the last few years and expect to enhance further will provide a sustainable advantage.', 'Turning to our operations. In the Gulf Coast, the Galveston Bay reformer repairs progressed as planned. We started the unit back up in mid-November and returned to full operating rates by mid-December. At our Martinez facility, we will be operating at approximately 22,000 barrels per day in the short-term. We have been working closely with the regulators to proceed with repairs to ensure safe and reliable operations. Let me move to Slide 7, which shows our capital investment plan for 2024 in a bit more detail. MPC’s investment plan, excluding MPLX, totals $1.25 billion. The plan includes $1.2 billion for Refining & Marketing segments. Our growth capital plan is approximately $825 million between traditional projects and low carbon. We are investing primarily at our large competitively advantaged facilities to enhance shareholder value and position MPC well into the future.', 'Within traditional Refining & Marketing, $100 million is associated with a multiyear project to increase finished distillate yields at the Galveston Bay refinery. $375 million is focused on smaller projects targeted at enhancing yields at our refineries, improving energy efficiency and lowering our cost as well as investments in our branded marketing footprint. Within low carbon, approximately $330 million is allocated to a multiyear infrastructure investment at our Los Angeles refinery, which will improve energy efficiency and lower facility emissions and $20 million for smaller projects focused on emerging opportunities. Slide 8 provides an overview of the multiyear investment at our Los Angeles refinery. The Los Angeles refinery is the core asset in our West Coast value chain and is one of the most competitive refineries in the regions.', 'This investment, once completed, is expected to further enhance its cost competitiveness by integrating and modernizing utility systems, which will improve reliability and increase energy efficiency. Additionally, a portion of this improvement addresses a new regulation mandating further reductions in emissions. This regulation applies to all Southern California refineries. The improvements are expected to be completed by the end of 2025. We expect to generate a return on our investment of approximately 20%. Turning to Slide 9. At Galveston Bay, we are investing to construct a 90,000 barrel per day high-pressure distillate hydrotreater. This project is planned to strengthen the competitiveness of the refinery through increased production of higher value finished products.', 'Once in service, the new distillate hydrotreater will upgrade high sulfur distillate to ultra-low sulfur diesel, eliminating the need for third-party processing or sales into shrinking lower value high sulfur export market. This strategic investment ensures we provide the clean burning fuel of the world demand and further enhances the competitive position of our U.S. Gulf Coast value chain. The project is expected to be complete by year-end 2027 and generate a return of over 20%. Turning to our low carbon initiatives, we challenge ourselves to lead in sustainable energy by setting meaningful targets to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, methane emissions and fresh water intensity. Targets, which we believe we can demonstrate a tangible pathway to accomplish.', 'In our 2024 capital outlook, we are investing to significantly lower energy intensity and emissions at Los Angeles, one of our largest refineries. Additionally, we are investing in smaller amounts of capital in early-stage developments like RNG which could significantly aid in greenhouse gas emission reductions in the future. Overall, we are taking disciplined steps to advance our goal to lower the carbon intensity of our operations and the products we manufacture, while continuing to supply a growing and evolving market by safely operating our current asset base with the objective to deliver superior cash flow. Let me turn the call over to John.', 'John Quaid: Thanks, Maryann. Moving to fourth quarter highlights, Slide 11 provides a summary of our financial results. This morning, we reported adjusted earnings per share of $3.98 for the fourth quarter and $23.63 for the full year. This quarter’s results were adjusted to exclude the $0.14 per share net effect of three items, a $145 million LIFO inventory charge, $47 million of net recoveries related to MPLX’s Garyville incident response, and a $92 million gain recognized by MPLX. Adjusted EBITDA was over $3.5 billion for the quarter and almost $19 billion for the year. Cash flow from operations, excluding working capital changes, was nearly $2.3 billion for the quarter and $13.9 billion for the year. During the quarter, we returned $311 million to shareholders through dividend payments and repurchased over $2.5 billion of our shares.', 'Slide 12 shows the sequential change in adjusted EBITDA from the third quarter to fourth quarter of 2023 as well as the reconciliation between net income and adjusted EBITDA for the quarter. Adjusted EBITDA was lower sequentially by approximately $2.2 billion, driven by lower R&M margins. The tax rate for the quarter was 18%, reflecting the impacts of the MPLX structure and a discrete benefit largely related to state taxes. For 2024, we expect our tax rate to be around 21%. Moving to our segment results. Slide 13 provides an overview of our Refining & Marketing segment for the fourth quarter. Our 13 refineries ran at a 91% utilization, processing nearly 2.7 million barrels of crude per day. Sequentially, per barrel margins were lower across all regions driven by lower crack spreads.', 'Capture for the quarter was 122%. Refining operating costs were $5.67 per barrel in the fourth quarter, higher sequentially due to higher energy cost, particularly on the West Coast as well as higher project-related expenses associated with planned turnaround activity. Slide 14 provides an overview of our Refining & Marketing margin capture of 122% for the quarter. We ran well and our commercial teams executed effectively to deliver strong results. Capture this quarter benefited from late product margin tailwinds, in particular for jet fuel as well as less of a headwind from secondary product prices. Slide 15 shows the changes in our Midstream segment adjusted EBITDA versus the third quarter of 2023. Our Midstream segment delivered strong fourth quarter results.', 'For the full year 2023, our Midstream segment EBITDA is up 7% compared to the prior year. Our Midstream business is growing and generating strong cash flows as we advance high return growth projects anchored in the Marcellus and Permian basins. Slide 16 presents the elements of change in our consolidated cash position for the fourth quarter. Operating cash flow, excluding changes in working capital, was nearly $2.3 billion in the quarter, driven by both our Refining and Midstream businesses. Working capital was a $1.1 billion use of cash for the quarter, driven primarily by declining crude prices. Cash from ops for the quarter was also impacted by a $320 million headwind from changes in our income tax receivable, which you might usually expect to see as a working capital change.', 'Capital expenditures and investments totaled $896 million this quarter. This includes MPLX’s acquisition of full ownership of a gathering and processing joint venture in the Delaware Basin for approximately $270 million. MPC returned $2.8 billion via share repurchases and dividends during the quarter. This represents an approximate 125% payout of the $2.3 billion of operating cash flow, excluding changes in working capital, highlighting our commitment to deliver superior shareholder returns. As of January 26, we have approximately $5.9 billion remaining under our current share repurchase authorization. And at the end of the fourth quarter, MPC had approximately $10.2 billion in consolidated cash and short-term investments, including approximately $1 billion of MPLX cash.', 'Turning to guidance on Slide 17, we provide our first quarter outlook. We expect crude throughput volumes of almost 2.5 million barrels per day, representing utilization of 83%. Utilization is forecasted to be lower than fourth quarter levels due mainly to higher turnaround activity. Planned turnaround expense is projected to be approximately $600 million. We are executing turnarounds at 4 of our largest refineries, Galveston Bay, Garyville, Los Angeles and Robinson, all in the first quarter when margins are typically lower to minimize the financial impact of these outages. Turnaround expense for the full year is anticipated to be similar to last year at around $1.3 billion. Operating costs in the first quarter are expected to be $5.85 per barrel higher sequentially due mainly to lower throughput volumes associated with the significant planned turnaround activity.', 'Distribution costs are expected to be approximately $1.45 billion for the quarter. Corporate costs are expected to be $185 million. And with that, let me pass it back to Mike.', 'Mike Hennigan: Thanks, John. We’ve delivered strong execution on our strategic commitments again this year. This includes running reliably with high utilization, structural improvements to our commercial performance, fostering a low cost culture and strengthening the competitive position of our assets. At MPLX, the partnership has continued to grow, increasing its cash flow and its cash distribution MPC. We have invested capital to grow earnings while exercising strict capital discipline. This has resulted in superior cash flow generation and supported the repurchase initiatives. Looking forward, we will continue to prioritize capital investments to ensure the safe and reliable performance of our assets, and we will also invest in projects where we believe there are attractive returns.', 'We believe our focus on safety, environmental, I’m sorry, operational excellence and sustained commercial improvement will position us to capture this enhanced mid-cycle environment, which we expect to continue longer-term, given our advantages over marginal sources of supply and growing global demand. MPC’s Midstream segment, consisting primarily of MPLX has grown EBITDA by $1.3 billion since 2019, which is a 6% compound annual growth rate over the last 4 years. As MPLX continues to grow its free cash flow, we believe it’s in a strong position to continue to consistently grow its distributions. As a result of MPLX increase against distribution 10% of reach in the last 2 years, and MPC expects to receive $2.2 billion of cash distribution, which reflects a $400 million increase since 2020.', 'Each 10% distribution increase is approximately $200 million of additional cash flow that MPC receives through its ownership in the partnership. In summary, this year, we generated $14 billion of cash from operations. We increased our dividend 10%, repurchased $11.6 billion of shares, resulting in a 92% payout ratio. In 2023, MPC’s total shareholder return was 31%. We believe MPC is positioned as the refinery investment of choice with the strongest through-cycle cash generation and the ability to deliver superior return to our shareholders. With that, let me turn it back over to Kristina.', 'Kristina Kazarian: Thanks Mike. As we open the call for your questions, as a courtesy to all participants, we ask that you limit yourself to one question and a follow-up. If time permits, we will reprompt for additional questions. Sheila, we’re ready.', 'See also 20 Highest Quality Fabrics in the World and 15 Highest Quality Bottled Water Brands in The US.', 'To continue reading the Q&A session, please click here.']"

Despite this raise, the dividend yield of 1.2% is only a modest boost to shareholder returns."", ""While the dividend yield is important for income investors, it is also important to consider any large share price moves, as this will generally outweigh any gains from distributions. Investors will be pleased to see that General Motors' stock price has increased by 31% in the last 3 months, which is good for shareholders and can also explain a decrease in the dividend yield."", ' See our latest analysis for General Motors ', ""Even a low dividend yield can be attractive if it is sustained for years on end. However, General Motors' earnings easily cover the dividend. As a result, a large proportion of what it earned was being reinvested back into the business."", 'Looking forward, earnings per share is forecast to rise by 21.2% over the next year. Assuming the dividend continues along recent trends, we think the payout ratio could be 3.3% by next year, which is in a pretty sustainable range.', ""Although the company has a long dividend history, it has been cut at least once in the last 10 years. The annual payment during the last 10 years was $1.20 in 2014, and the most recent fiscal year payment was $0.48. This works out to be a decline of approximately 8.8% per year over that time. A company that decreases its dividend over time generally isn't what we are looking for."", ""Given that the track record hasn't been stellar, we really want to see earnings per share growing over time. It's encouraging to see that General Motors has been growing its earnings per share at 8.9% a year over the past five years. With a decent amount of growth and a low payout ratio, we think this bodes well for General Motors' prospects of growing its dividend payments in the future."", 'In summary, it is always positive to see the dividend being increased, and we are particularly pleased with its overall sustainability.

Our conference call materials were issued this morning and are available on GM's Investor Relations website. We are also broadcasting this call via webcast. Joining us today are Mary Barra, GM's Chair and CEO; and Paul Jacobson, GM's Executive Vice President and CFO.

Please review the Safe Harbor Statements on the first page of our presentation as the content of our call will be governed by this language. And with that, I'm delighted to turn the call over to Mary."", ""Mary Barra: Thanks, Ashish, and good morning, everyone. As we begin 2024, I believe GM is well positioned for a year of strong financial performance that builds on everything we accomplished and importantly learned in 2023. Consensus is growing that the US economy, the job market, and auto sales will continue to be resilient. At GM we expect healthy industry sales of about 16 million units. We have an unmatched ICE portfolio in North America, rising EV production on the LTM platform and GM Financial continues to perform well. We're building on a foundation of products that our customers love. In 2023, GM sold more vehicles in the US than anyone else. All of our US brands grew their sales year-over-year and gained US market share with healthy margins, thanks to stable pricing and incentives that were more than 20% below the industry average."", ""The Chevrolet Bolt EV and EUV had record sales. We led the industry in initial quality for the second year in a row according to J.D. Power. And we now have led the industry in combined pickup, full-size van, and full-size SUV sales for 10 consecutive years, making us the leader in the highest ATP quadrant of the market and helping us lead the commercial fleet market. And we have passed Honda and Toyota in the most affordable quadrant, thanks to attractive and profitable vehicles like the Chevrolet Trax, which is one of Car and Driver's 10 best trucks and SUVs, and the Buick Envista, which is winning with younger buyers. In fact, more than one in four Envista customers are between the ages of 18 and 35. The broad-based momentum we have today is important for our future because our customers are the most loyal in the industry."", 'All of this success contributed to full year EBIT-adjusted of $12.4 billion and adjusted auto-free cash flow of $11.7 billion in 2023, which brings our total to more than $22 billion for 2022 and 2023. Almost two-thirds of that cash is being returned to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases, including the impact of the $10 billion accelerated share repurchase program that we announced in November. Through the ASR, we immediately retired 215 million common shares in the fourth quarter. Our current share count is less than 1.2 billion and we are working to reduce this even further to less than 1 billion common shares outstanding, which would be about 600 million fewer than at our peak. As we look ahead, our priorities and our commitments are clear.', ""They are to maximize the opportunities we have with our winning ICE portfolio, grow our EV business profitably, deliver strong margins and cash flow, and refocus and relaunch crews. Across the enterprise, we are taking important steps to deliver on each priority. Let's start with our ICE portfolio. Chevrolet's crossover lineup had record sales last year, and this year we're enhancing two of its most important models which compete in growing segments. For example, Super Cruise will be available on the Traverse for the first time and we will introduce a new premium Z71 off-road model. The 2025 Chevrolet Equinox that we unveiled last week is another great example. It has more standard safety equipment, new truck-inspired styling, and a strong focus on technology."", ""And importantly, both the Traverse and Equinox will have higher projected margins than the outgoing model. Buick and GMC are also launching new crossovers this year to keep our momentum going. In our EV business, we expect our US portfolio to be variable profit positive in the second half of the year based on our current expectations for EV demand and production growth. Strong interest in our vehicles, lower commodity prices and other factors will support this. Our plan is to produce in wholesale 200,000 to 300,000 Altium-based Chevrolet, GMC, Cadillac and BrightDrop EVs in North America this year, but we will be guided by customer demand. It's true, the pace of EV growth has slowed, which has created some uncertainty. We will build to demand and we are encouraged that many third party forecasts have US EV deliveries rising from about 7% of the industry in 2023 to at least 10% in 2024, which would mean another year of record EV sales."", ""We believe our competitive position will improve throughout the year based on higher production of the Cadillac LYRIQ, the GMC Hummer EV, the Chevrolet Blazer EV, and the Silverado EV work truck. We're also excited to have the Chevrolet Equinox EV and the Silverado EV RST, the GMC Sierra EV Denali, and the Cadillac Escalade IQ arriving in showrooms over the course of the year. We are confident in the design and performance of these vehicles. For example, the LYRIQ is driving growth at Cadillac. Its sales have increased sequentially every month since September and January deliveries should be in line with December despite winter storms across the country. We also have more than 10,000 -- excuse me, 100,000 reservations and orders for EV pickups that we expect to fulfill in 2024 and 2025."", ""However, if demand conditions change, we'll take advantage of our manufacturing flexibility in Spring Hill and Ramos to build more ICE models and fewer EVs. We can also mix between different EV products at Factory ZERO. Ultimately, we will follow the customer. The supply chain, manufacturing, and software changes we have made will support our growth. On the battery front, our Ultium Cells joint venture is at full production in Ohio, and the new plant in Tennessee will begin shipping cells this quarter. In addition, our supply chain team has moved very quickly to resource two minor cell components after the US Treasury published its updated IRA guidelines in December. This change means that new production going forward of the Chevrolet Blazer EV and the Cadillac LYRIQ will qualify for the full $7,500 consumer credit."", 'We work closely with our dealers to ensure consistent pricing for our customers, which we estimate will impact no more than about 25,000 vehicles. Our battery module production is on schedule. The team has improved the automated equipment at our assembly plant used to build modules and installation of new high capacity assembly lines should be complete by mid-year. Our software and services team is also in the process of resolving the stability issues some customers have experienced with the Chevrolet Blazer EV that impacted their screens and charging experience. And they are working with a huge sense of urgency to lift the stop sales soon. We disappointed these customers and we know it. We are determined to get the software right and we will.', 'We have made several organizational and process improvements that will help us deliver the best possible customer experience going forward. Among several important organizational realignments, we established a software quality division within the software and services team that has been performing a retrospective on the Blazer EV and has improved the current software development and test processes across the enterprise. Outcomes of this activity are getting applied to all programs going forward and they include improved standardization of the software development and release process, increased focus on test automation at the vehicle level, and additional quality gates and metrics for software at the vehicle level. From a margin and cash flow perspective, we are making good progress on cost reduction and capital efficiency.', 'Compared with 2022, our fixed cost net of depreciation and amortization will be down $2 billion as we exit 2024, which will offset the higher impact -- the impact of higher labor costs. We are also beginning to see savings from winning with simplicity, and all of our current and future programs have embraced this very important way of designing products. Each team is responsible for creating trim series that make vehicles easy to order with the content customers want and far fewer standalone options. By making more equipment standard in trim series with logical price swaps, we can eliminate literally thousands of unique part numbers and dozens of software releases. For example, we have eliminated over 1,000 selectable options across our current and near-term product programs, which is reducing hardware, software, ordering and manufacturing complexity, and importantly, all the costs associated with them.', ""In 2024, the savings are expected to be about $200 million. To be clear, we're talking about $200 million of savings to execute the same product plan. These savings will grow over time as we apply the discipline to future products like our next generation full-size pickups. We're also continuing to balance capital priorities and consistent free cash flow generation. We expect that our 2024 capital spending will be in the $10.5 billion to $11.5 billion, which is roughly flat year-over-year and down considerably from the $13 billion top of our end initial 2023 guidance. Our forward plans include bringing our plug-in hybrid technology to select vehicles in North America. Let me be clear, GM remains committed to eliminating tailpipe emissions from our light duty vehicles by 2035."", ""But in the interim, deploying plug-in technology in strategic segments will deliver some of the environmental benefits of EVs as the nation continues to build its charging infrastructure. We are timing the launches to help us comply with the more stringent fuel economy and tailpipe emission standards that are being proposed. And we plan to deliver the program in a capital and cost-efficient way because the technology is already in production in other markets. We'll have more to share about this down the road. Moving to Cruise. Last week we released the results of the third-party reviews and we've already begun to implement significant changes to build a better Cruise. We are committed to earning back the trust with our regulators and the public through our actions."", 'Our plan 2024 investment in Cruise reflects our more deliberate and cadence go-to-market strategy and we are developing new financial targets and a new roadmap. Spending will be down considerably this year, but we will continue to invest in the people who are advancing the software, specialized hardware, and AI capabilities. This reflects our commitment to our vision, which is to deliver the safety benefits of self-driving technology and a scalable, profitable business. I look forward to sharing our timetable for returning Cruise EVs to the road soon. To summarize, we learned a lot in 2023, and those learnings are helping us build our strengths and addressing our challenges. Everyone on the team is committed to building on our momentum and creating shareholding value.', ""You'll see in our proxy statement this spring, executive compensation is tied even more closely to delivering our comprehensive ICE, EV, AV, and software plans, while meeting our financial targets. So our goals are truly aligned with yours. Before I turn the call over to Paul, I would like to share some thoughts about our next Investor Day. Because of the significant changes that are underway at GM and Cruise, we think it makes sense to wait until later in the year to host an event. This will give our software team the time to focus on software for our upcoming launches, and we will be able to share more tangible proof points on all four pillars of our strategy, ICE, EV, AV, and software. When we do get together, we will show you what we've done, not just tell you what we're going to do."", ""In the meantime, we've already provided a roadmap for EV profitability in 2025, and we'll share updates on Cruise as we finalize the technology and relaunch plans. With that, I'll turn it over to Paul to go through our 2023 financials and provide more details on our 2024 outlook. Then we'll take your questions."", ""Paul Jacobson: Thank you, Mary, and good morning, everyone. I appreciate you all joining us this morning. I'd like to begin by recognizing the entire GM team for what they accomplished in 2023. When you look back over the last couple of years, the results show an impressive trend in revenue growth, EPS consistency, and cash generation. For the full year, our EBIT-adjusted of $12.4 billion came in slightly above the midpoint of the range we guided to in November, thanks to the continued strength of the core business. We grew revenue by 10% year-over-year to a record $172 billion and generated $7.68 of EPS diluted adjustments. A key focus has been profitable growth. And for the full year, we demonstrated this by growing U.S. market share by 30 basis points, while keeping incentives well below industry averages."", ""It's important to mention the 2023 actions we've taken to reduce fixed costs and the progress made on the $2 billion net cost reduction program. For example, automotive engineering was reduced by $400 million, driven by portfolio simplification, realizing the benefits from winning with simplicity as well as our drive to virtual engineering. Marketing spend was reduced by $500 million and we expect another $400 million this year. And we saw approximately $500 million from lower BrightDrop and other growth business spend, along with the impact of the voluntary separation program across the enterprise. These $1.4 billion of fixed cost reductions were partially offset by $400 million of higher depreciation and amortization, meeting our target to achieve half of the $2 billion program in 2023."", ""We began 2023 with $24 billion of auto cash and marketable securities, generated full year adjusted auto-free cash flow of $11.7 billion, and returned approximately $12 billion to our shareholders through dividends and share repurchases, including the impact of the $10 billion accelerated share repurchase program initiated in Q4. Coming into 2024, we are well positioned with roughly $20 billion of auto cash and marketable securities and will appropriately balance our capital allocation priorities with the plan to continue to return capital to our shareholder through repurchases and our new higher dividend rate. Let's get into Q4 results. Total company revenue was $43 billion, consistent year-over-year, despite the impact of the strike. However, we did have a number of cost items that we do not expect to reoccur in 2024 that impacted our margin performance in the quarter."", 'We achieved $1.8 billion in EBIT adjusted, 4.1% EBIT adjusted margins, and $1.24 in EPS diluted adjusted. These results were also impacted by the strike, which had a $900 million EBIT adjusted impact in Q4 and a $1.1 billion impact for the full year, primarily from losing an estimated 95,000 units of production. Additionally, we increased our inventory valuation allowances by $1.1 billion to remeasure battery cell and EV inventory held at year end. This adjustment was significantly larger in Q4 versus prior quarters, driven by a combination of increasing cell production in preparation for our 2024 EV acceleration and holding more EVs in company inventory. Adjustments for the full year totaled $1.7 billion. We expect this to be substantially lower in 2024 as we continue to make progress toward our EBIT margin targets on EVs. North America delivered Q4 EBIT-adjusted of $2 billion, down $1.6 billion year-over-year, driven primarily by the $900 million strike impact and $1 billion of inventory adjustments I just discussed.', ""The performance was also driven by higher pricing and lower fixed costs, which more than offset mixed headwinds. North America margin of 8.7% was within our targeted 8% to 10% range for the full year and included a 1.6 percentage point impact from the strike and the inventory adjustments. Part of this performance is from proactively managing our inventory levels, helping to minimize incentives. I'm pleased that we ended the year at 50 days of U.S. inventory, which is at the low end of our 50 to 60 day target range, and incentives that were more than 20% below the industry average. GM International had another solid quarter with Q4 EBIT-adjusted of $300 million, which was consistent year-over-year. I want to thank the entire international team for another year of good execution and delivering $1.2 billion of EBIT adjusted."", ""GM Financial also performed well with Q4 EBIT-adjusted of $700 million. down slightly year-over-year. Full year results were $3 billion at the top end of the $2.5 billion to $3 billion guidance range. Portfolio credit metrics continue to be strong, in part due to a predominantly prime credit mix with net charge off up slightly due to moderation in credit performance. GM financial has consistently been an integral part of the business supporting our customers, supporting our dealers and paying dividends of $1.8 billion to GM in 2023. Cruise expenses were $800 million in the quarter, up $300 million year-over-year and similar to the spend level in Q3. So let's look ahead to 2024. We expect EBIT-adjusted in the $12 billion to $14 billion range."", ""EPS diluted adjusted to be in the $8.50 to $9.50 range, including an estimated $1.45 per share benefit from last year's accelerated share repurchase based on the current share price, which will be partially offset by roughly $0.50 headwind from a higher tax rate and lower interest income on lower cash balances, and adjusted automotive free cash flow in the $8 billion, $10 billion range for the year. I want to summarize a few items in 2023 that we don't expect to repeat and will help to contribute to our higher outlook for this year despite some of the potential macro headwinds. These include the $800 million EBIT-adjusted impact from the LG agreements. And as a reminder, this will save us an additional $1,000 per vehicle going forward on our path to EV profitability."", '$1.1 billion EBIT adjusted impact from the strike and a substantial amount of the $1.7 billion of net realizable value adjustments as we work through the sell inventory, improve EV profitability, and benefit from lower lithium prices. In light of the current macro environment, we anticipate a market similar to 2023 with total US industry volumes of around 16 million units. We expect wholesale volume to grow as we rebound from the impact of the strike and continue our track record of market share gains, primarily from higher EV volumes. However, we do assume mixed headwinds from our ICE production driven by anticipated actions to proactively manage full size truck inventory levels. We also assume a 2% to 2.5% pricing headwind year-over-year, but overall we remain confident in our ability to balance production, inventory levels and profitability, while growing revenues and sustain our North America margins in the 8% to 10% range.', 'We are on track to realize the remaining $1 billion of net fixed cost savings with the benefits coming from similar areas to last year, including marketing, engineering, and the full year benefit of the actions we took in 2023. We expect $1.3 billion in higher labor costs, along with logistics being a slight headwind year-over-year, primarily driven by higher finished vehicle shipping costs. Cruise expenses are expected to be around $1 billion lower, given the new operational plan Mary mentioned earlier. In November we gave an update on our path to EV profitability with an estimated EBIT margin improvement of more than 60 percentage points and a lower overall EV loss in 2024 compared to 2023, even when you exclude the impact of the inventory adjustments.', 'This will largely be driven by higher EV volumes and fixed cost leverage from both EV and battery cell manufacturing, along with the benefit of all of our North America volume being on the Ultium platform. We are already seeing an improvement in cell cost today, driven by significantly lower raw materials prices and better pricing on cells produced at our first battery JV plant from higher capacity utilization. For GM International, we expect relative stability in our South America and Middle East operations, however, we anticipate ongoing pressure in China, including the plan to reduce production in Q1 to balance dealer inventory levels. These actions will likely result in Q1 China equity income being a slight loss, with a return to profitability starting in Q2.', 'For GM Financial, we expect EBIT-adjusted again in the $2.5 billion to $3 billion range with credit performance and used vehicle prices returning to normal throughout the year, along with earning asset growth from retail loan originations and the commercial loan portfolio. We are forecasting another year of robust automotive adjusted free cash flow, but we anticipate modest year-over-year headwinds from 2023 working capital benefits that we assume will not repeat and the timing of payments associated with accruals recognized last year. For example, warranty, tax, and higher assumed inventory levels. From a modeling perspective, remember that Q1 is our seasonally weakest cash flow quarter of the year. We expect our capital spend to be similar to 2023, inclusive of $500 million to $1 billion of investments in our battery JVs. Our 2024 effective tax rate is assumed to be in the range of 18% to 20%, up from last year, primarily due to the global mix of earnings and lower R&D credits primarily due to lower Cruise spend.', 'And our full year EPS guidance assumes the weighted-average fully diluted share count of slightly below 1.15 billion shares. This includes the impact of the remaining shares to be purchased through the ASR, which we expect will reduce our fully diluted share count to below 1.1 billion shares once completed. The actual share count will depend on several factors that impact the final ASR settlement, including the average share price during execution and excludes the impact of any incremental share repurchases beyond the ASR. In closing, we know the EV market is not going to grow linearly and we are prepared to flex between ICE and EV production, given our unique manufacturing capabilities to balance inventory levels and to build customer demand.', ""This will help support pricing and our continued incentive discipline. While we have faced some challenges in our EV transition, we are actively working to address them and remain excited about our future and look forward to a successful 2024. This concludes our opening comments, and we'll now move to the Q&A portion of the call."", 'See also 20 Highest Quality Fabrics in the World and 15 Cheapest Countries to Get Permanent Residency Heading into 2024.', 'To continue reading the Q&A session, please click here.']"

This marks the third consecutive monthly rise in consumer confidence, reflecting a trend that could contribute to sustained momentum in household spending throughout the year.Dana Peterson, the Chief Economist at The Conference Board, attributes the surge in consumer confidence to various factors. These include a slowdown in inflation, expectations of lower interest rates in the near future and overall favorable employment conditions. As businesses continue to maintain a robust labor force, consumers are finding reassurance in the stability of the job market.With consumer confidence hitting a two-year high, economists anticipate a positive ripple effect on spending habits. Consumer spending plays a pivotal role in the US economy, constituting about 70% of economic activity. The combination of resilient demand, a healthy job market and improved inflation expectations has the potential to keep the economy on an upward trajectory.The robust consumer confidence figures align with recent positive economic reports. Gross Domestic Product, a key measure of goods and services produced, increased at a notable 3.3% annualized rate in the final quarter of 2023.

That is in line with its 13% annual growth over the past five years. Compare this with the broader industry, which analyst estimates (in aggregate) suggest will see revenues grow 8.0% annually.

Todd will then provide a more detailed analysis of our financial performance and discuss our 2024 financial guidance.

Total sales for the fourth quarter were $327 million, representing a year-over-year increase of 30% as reported and an increase of 32% in constant currency.These growth rates are obviously aided by the fourth quarter 2022 warehouse disruption, which impacted each part of our business differently in the fourth quarter of 2022. Fourth quarter earnings delivered GAAP net income of $33.1 million, an increase of 24% over net income of $26.6 million in the fourth quarter of 2022.

When you look at the full year growth rates across domestic and international General Surgery and Orthopedics and single use and capital.My perspective is that this speaks to the underlying strength of the entire product portfolio that has been built strategically over time. 2023 GAAP net income totaled $64.5 million compared to a net loss of $80.6 million in 2022. Excluding special items that affected comparability our adjusted net income of $108.3 million increased 27% year over year, and our adjusted diluted net earnings per share of $3.45 increased 30% year-over-year.Looking back at 2023, I'm very proud of both the top and bottom line performance, which exceeded and finished at the top end of the original respective 2023 guidance early in the year. We quickly remediated the warehouse issues from late 2022, and I can confidently say our global distribution strategy has never been clear.Our 2022 acquisitions performed well with into bones now conduit Foot and Ankle delivering double digit growth for the full year, while absorbing the growing pains of supplier integration and leadership transitions.

Overall, the entire portfolio is strong. And in 2024, we expect the introduction of several new products across each of our businesses. And while I usually reserve the financial detail analysis for Todd, I'm proud of the team for driving our leverage ratio down to 4.1 times as our increased focus on working capital and overall asset management continues to improve.In summary, 2023 was a great year for Continental. Looking forward, I could not be more confident in our prospects to continue delivering top-line growth and leveraged earnings growth driven by clinically differentiated solutions across our business. This stems from my confidence that we have a talented global team armed with an innovative, high-growth portfolio, which was built through a disciplined combination of organic and inorganic development across both our General Surgery and Orthopedics categories.The strategic outlook for Conwed remains strong and this will benefit patients, customers, employees and shareholders in the quarters and years ahead.With that, I'll turn the call over to Todd, who will provide a more detailed analysis of our financial performance and to discuss our 2024 financial guidance.

As Kurt said, we are currently dealing with normal growing pains in this business, which caused Q4 to be below trend only growing in the mid I'm sorry, in the high single digits. So still above market, but below what we're used to and what we expect we continue to expect this business to outgrow the market and be a double digit grower for us in 2024.For total, worldwide general surgery revenue increased 41.7%. In the quarter, US general surgery revenue grew 47.6%, while internationally general surgery revenue increased 27.8%. Obviously, these elevated growth rates are aided by easy comps from the prior year, but we continue to see the same trend of strong growth from our leading products on this side of the business.For the full year of 2023, our total sales increased 20.9%, which represents 18.4% growth on an organic basis. For the full year, our US and international sales both grew 20.9% versus the prior year, which is amazing from a balance perspective,.Worldwide Orthopedics revenue increased 17.7% for the full year of 2023. In the US orthopaedic sales grew 15.2%, and internationally orthopedic sales increased 19.2%. Total worldwide general surgery revenue increased 23.4% for the full year 2023 US general surgery revenue grew 23.4%, while internationally general surgery revenue increased 23.5%.Now let's move to the expense side of the income statement, we will discuss expenses and profitability in the fourth quarter and the year, excluding special items, which include charges for acquisitions and contingent consideration, termination of distributor agreements, legal matters, debt refinancing costs, restructuring and software implementation costs, amortization of intangible assets and amortization of deferred financing fees, net of tax.Adjusted gross margin for the fourth quarter was 56.4%, which is a 50 basis point sequential improvement over Q3 and an increase of 220 basis points from the prior year quarter. So the product mix tailwind we are counting on is real and working the challenges we had in Q4 in the US orthopedic business affected gross margin.We also made some process improvements in one of our plants that drove some period costs that we recognized in the quarter. For the full year, adjusted gross margin was 55.2%, a decrease of 10 basis points from 2022, while margin improved sequentially throughout the year. Inflation experienced throughout 2022, with cycling through the P&L in the first half of 2023, offsetting the underlying favorable mix impact of the product portfolio.Research and development expense for the fourth quarter was 4.3% of sales, 60 basis points lower than the prior year quarter. For the full year 2023, R&D expense was 4.2% of sales, 30 basis points lower than 2022. For the fourth quarter, adjusted SG&A expenses were 36.7% of sales. Leverage gained on a higher sales drove a 300 basis point improvement over the prior year quarter. So despite the gross margin headwinds, we delivered 15.8% adjusted operating margin in Q4.For the full year, adjusted SG&A expenses were 37.4% of sales, 140 basis points lower than in 2022. On an adjusted basis, interest expense was $8.0 million in the fourth quarter and $33.7 million for the full year. The adjusted effective effective tax rate in Q4 was 24.2%. For the full year, our adjusted effective tax rate was 23.0%.Fourth quarter, GAAP net income was $33.1 million. This compares to GAAP net income of $26.6 million in Q4 of 2022. GAAP earnings per diluted share were $1.05 this quarter compared to $0.86 a year ago. For the full year, GAAP net income was $64.5 million compared to GAAP net loss of $8.6 million in 2022. GAAP earnings per diluted share were $2.4 in 2023 compared to GAAP net loss per diluted share of $2.68 in 2022.Excluding the impact of special items discussed earlier in the fourth quarter, we reported adjusted net income of 33.2 million, an increase of 156.5% compared to the fourth quarter of 2022. Our Q4 adjusted diluted earnings per share were $1.06, an increase of 152.4% compared to the prior year quarter. For the full year of 2023, we reported adjusted net income of $108.3 million, an increase of 27.4% compared to 2022. Our full year adjusted diluted net earnings per share were $3.45, an increase of 30.2% compared to the prior year.Turning to the balance sheet, our cash balance at the end of the year was $24.3 million compared to $30.5 million as of September 30. Accounts receivable days as of December 31, were 67 days compared to 68 days at the end of Q3.Inventory days at the at year end were 198 days compared to 215 days at September 30. Our long-term debt at the end of the year was $903.1 million versus $942.2 million as of September 30. Our leverage ratio on December 31 was 4.1 times.Cash flow provided from operations in the quarter was $56.4 million compared to cash flow used for operations of $11.6 million in the fourth quarter of 2022. Cash flow provided from operations for the full year 2023 was $125.3 million compared to $33.4 million in 2022. Both Q4 and the full year are all-time records for this metric.Capital expenditures in the fourth quarter were $4.9 million compared to $5.7 million a year ago. For the full year, capital expenditures were $19.0 million compared to $21.8 million in 2022.Now let's turn to financial guidance. For the full year 2024, we expect revenue in the range of $1.34 billion and $1.365 billion, representing year-over-year growth of approximately 8% to 10%. Q1 2023 had the benefit of the backlog catch-up from our 2022 warehouse issue. So the Q1 2024 growth rate, we estimate between 3% and 5%.Q1 also has one less selling day than the prior year. Q3 and Q4 both have one extra day. So the full year has one extra day over 2023. We believe the growth rates should accelerate as we move through the year. Q2 may be more like mid to high single digits as the ortho business ramps back up and then Q3 and Q4 performance should get us to that 8% to 10% for the full year.Based on current rates, we expect currency to have an immaterial impact to 2024 for growth rates on the top and bottom line. For the past seven months, we have attempted to allay concerns regarding a potential insulator integrated with a new surgical robot beginning with a very detailed discussion of the clinical benefits and patent protection around our technology.As part of our second quarter 2023 earnings call. To be clear, we continue to believe the impact on AirSeal will be minimal, but we don't think it is wise to have company guidance that ignores such a pervasive theoretical market overhang.So we have elected to include in our guidance what we believe to be a worst-case estimate of what that impact could be while we aren't going to share the specifics of our model, I will tell you that our guidance allows for a conversion rate associated with placements of the new robot. That is roughly half of what we have seen historically.As a reminder, AirSeal has successfully treated millions of patients and has significant data showing 50% reduction in length of stay and other significant benefits. We believe surgeons value the clinical outcomes and associated data and will want to see similar or better results from any new technology before making a change. Finally, to mitigate a theoretical slowdown in conversions, we would accelerate the shift of our resources and energy in favor of general laparoscopic cases.Turning to adjusted gross margin, the improving mix of the portfolio remains strong, which we think should drive between 100 and 150 basis points of margin expansion in 2024. That's gross margin expansion. This is a little slower than we envisioned for 2024 when we talked about it a year ago, the expected slow start in orthopedics and some improvements we still need to make in our manufacturing processes are contributing to that headwind.Having said that, it is still a very good gross margin story and it should build throughout the year. We expect Q1 to be about 100 basis points better than the prior year. And by Q4, we expect to be providing about 150 basis points of improvement over the prior year.So where does that put us on our quest to 60% gross margins by the end of 2025, if Q4 2024 is around 58% and the mix and improvements should be accelerating. We believe it is still possible to be around 60% by the end of 2025.If not, we would expect to be on a strong trend and hit that milestone comfortably in 2026. As a percentage of sales, we expect adjusted SG&A to improve between 60 and 80 basis points in 2024. For the full year, Q1 will likely be at a similar rate to the prior year Q1, given our typical sales force expansions to start the year, but we expect to gain leverage as we move through the year.We expect full year R&D expense in 2024 to be between 4% and 4.5% of sales. We expect Q1 in the mid fours, we expect adjusted interest expense to be between $33 million and $34 million in 2024. Keep in mind that we have $70 million of the 2.625% converts that mature this week.Those will be funded by our revolver. So expect interest expense for the first two quarters of 2024 to be between $8.5 million and %9.0 million per quarter. We expect the adjusted effective tax rate to be around 24.5% in 2024.We expect adjusted EPS in 2024 to be between $4.30 and $4.40, representing growth between 25% and 28% because gross margin is expected to build throughout the year and interest expense will be higher in the first half.We expect adjusted EPS in Q1 to be between $0.72 and $0.75, and we expect the first half to be between $1.65 and $1.71. We expect full year operating cash flow in 2024 to be between $145 million and $155 million with capital expenditures in the $20 million to 25 million range, putting free cash flow between $120 million and $135 million.We project adjusted EBITDA between $270 million and $280 million dollars for 2024. Given the heavier cash requirements in the beginning of the year, we expect our leverage ratio to stay relatively flat for the next six months and then drop into the low threes by the end of 2024.As Curt said, we are pleased with our record-setting 2023 performance and are focused on delivering a strong 2024. We remain confident in our ability to deliver innovation to our customers while driving market growth and profitability over the long term.And with that, we'd like to open the call to your questions, and I'll hand it back to Jonathan."", 'Operator', 'But certainly Ladies and gentlemen, if you do have a question at this time, please press star one on your telephone to remove yourself from the queue. Simply press star one. Once again, we ask that you please limit yourself to one question and one follow-up.Our first question comes from the line of Rick Wise from Stifel. Your question, please Yes.', ""Have a good afternoon. I bet that the arms let's start off with maybe one big picture question and my follow-up will be on something specific in it. I appreciate you've laid out extremely clearly some of the moving pieces and the timing. And what do you think on, Todd, how should we think about fourth quarter growth?I so let's say on a normalized basis, if let's say, adding back if allografts have been normal, what kind of growth might we have seen? And maybe you can talk about your confidence in the timing of getting that back on track. And what I'm really trying to get at here is we've heard from some other larger companies how the environment's improving are procedures rebounding a lot of strength? Do you feel like you're seeing that some of these moving pieces?"", ""So let me let me take that first part and maybe Curt can chime in on that second part, the it's really impossible, Rick, to trying to normalize what Q4 would be really not because of the allograft issue. That's a that's a smaller issue, right? It affects margins because that's a 100% margin product.As we've talked about before, the what's hard about getting to a normalized growth rate for Q4 is that Q4 2022 had that major disruption of our warehouse software implementation. And so it's just impossible to know what a normal quarter would have been a year ago. And so it's impossible to get to kind of what this Q4 is normalized because it is impossible to know.So we feel very good about the all the growth, the drivers of our business as we talked about the ortho business has had some lingering supply issues that are getting better every quarter and they get a little better. We're just not out of the woods yet. And so and we think we're a few months still from getting out of the woods there where we can move back to offense the way we want to be on that side of the business. But dumb, that's the beauty of diversification and balance that we talked about. And so the total business remains healthy and headed in the right direction. And when we can get all cylinders pumping like we like it will be even better."", ""And Rick, on the last part about the markets we just came a week or so ago from our global sales meeting leadership meetings. And I would tell you our teams are pretty optimistic about the markets broadly that's across our categories of orthopedics and general surgery, but also across our geographies. We have a higher concentration outside the US and most medtech companies and having folks from the various markets in attendance and talking about what they're seeing and what they're experienced and we feel like health care, generally speaking, is pretty pretty solid right now."", ""Yes, that's great. And just as a follow-up, I mean, it sounds like fibrates is in great shape and talk to us a little more about the challenges or the near term issues affecting into bones or Foot and Ankle that drove high single digits. So what happen and help us understand what you've dialed into the 2024 guide and why does it get better and when? Thank you very much."", ""Yes, I think the first part of that question, I'll take and I'll let Todd talk about guidance. The you buy a private company, you go through the integration steps, putting them into your systems, your process that includes supply chain.We're working hard on international registration. There's far more demand on the supply of the product and out of the gates and working with that, that new supplier base and trying to get them integrated into our systems and our processes, as is typically the case in smaller private companies or some evolution transition and disruption.And really those are the things that slowed us down. And we think to Todd's earlier comment, we think those things clear up here as we get through the first quarter and we get back on full stride as we get into second quarter. So it's I don't think it's anything systemic.I think it's all about integration and taking a private company, put it into a company of public companies framework and trying to what Tim, what those processes work the way they should."", ""And as far as guidance, Rick, we definitely have included in our guidance. The assumption that that business grows double digits in 2024. As Kurt said, we think this this hiccup is temporary. It doesn't magically go away with the turning of the calendar, but we do think it's a short-term pickup that we will get through and get this business back to double digits. And we do think it will be done at double digits for the full year."", 'We think it.', 'Thank you.', 'Operator', 'And our next question comes from the line of Robbie Marcus from GPM. Your question, please.', ""Yes, thanks for taking the question. Wanted to follow up on REX and I guess I'll ask it this way in our fourth quarter, Mist and margins were weak and 2024 is all predicated on improvement over the course of the year, although recognizing it includes some potential headwind for something that hasn't even happened yet with AirSeal. So I guess a lot of it is predicated on trust that the business will improve. And I was just wondering if you could give us an idea any more concrete reasons to believe that and our growth could be in the essentially double digits towards the end of the year to get to the guidance range and why that what the building blocks are that you have visibility to today versus June a bit of hope."", ""Yes. Thanks, Robbie. And I think if we just raise our view a little bit other than just Q4, right in Q2 and Q3, the last two quarters we reported on the business was growing in the low double digits organically. So this is not an aspiration or a hope to us. We know this portfolio can do it.We have identified the causes for this kind of slower Q4 than we expected. We do believe those are temporary. We think we're doing all the right things. And so it's not really the aberration is this is the hiccup. The business is built to grow as we've guided. And I think we've we feel very comfortable with the guidance we've provided today. Got it."", ""And as you think about just the M&A you've done and where the leverage is right now, how do you feel about your ability to continue to do M&A and your thoughts on the need for additional in the P&L? Thanks a lot."", ""You know, we finished up leverage ratio of 4.1, which was better than we had expected based on some fine work on asset management through the second half of the year. We've said publicly we didn't give our business development teams time off from a great asset came along we would take a very hard look at it. And we candidly continue to look at items. The bar is obviously much higher and with a little bit higher end market interest rates, the bar becomes just that much higher. I'm not sitting here today feeling we need to do anything. I really like the portfolio, as I said in my scripted comments, both on general surgery and orthopedics.There are some new products coming that are additive to the overall effort and I think are our teams on a global basis have plenty to say grace over in terms of talking to their customers about clinically differentiated offerings. But again, medtech one alone, if a great asset came on the market and we thought it was a great fit and it contributes to the long-term growth story.We take a really hard look at it, but I'm not sitting here saying we need to do it not sitting here saying we have to do anything to change our outlook and change or deliver do something to deliver on the guidance, the guidance we put out, we feel very good about, and that's based on the portfolio that we have with us today."", 'Great. Thanks for taking the questions.Thank you.', 'Operator', ""One moment for our next question. And our next question comes from the line of Matthew O'Brien from Piper Sandler. Your question please."", ""Matthew Oliver O'Brien"", ""Afternoon, thanks so much for taking the questions on par. When you were at our conference at the end of last year, you were talking about a double digit grower at minute and 2024. You're backing off that a little bit here and today for a product that I don't think it's supposed to be out until the end of the year. Most likely will come earlier than that, but is the lowering of 100 basis points, maybe 150 versus what you were expecting entirely because of this this hypothetical watch or are there other things in there? Specifically, it looked like your capital business was a little bit slower than we were kind of anticipating down sequentially versus normal years being up. Is there something else going on to that impacting the business? Just beyond your conservativism on AirSeal,"", ""I mean, there's only there's a few moving pieces here, but let me let me just clarify the record. You're right. Like we said Q2 and Q3, which were the quarters we reported on going into your conference, we had delivered between 11% and 12% organic growth in both of those quarters. And those quarters had no odd comp.There were those that were not easy comps, those were kind of normal comps. And so that was very representative of what the engine is doing. We still obviously were guiding 8 to 10 and with as you put some conservative assumptions behind that. We feel very good about the strength of this portfolio. Success here has always been defined as grow faster than your markets, right?So double digits is kind of a milestone that we'd all be very happy about. And but if it was, we're growing faster than our markets, we're winning. And I think 8 to 10 is clearly faster than our markets, even with those kind of assumptions, which I think you've got them right, there is nothing more than what we've said, Matt, and I think you captured in the ortho businesses in a little bit of a slow point. We've got to get that back to normal.And so that's affecting the start of the year. And we've been very generous. I think we've tried to lean into this narrative that's out there on our on our company and the valuation. And we've tried to make this really a worst case scenario in relation to this competitive launch that the market is worked up about. So we you're saying end of the year, our assumptions are that it comes way before that. And I think through again, I'm not sharing the details of our model, but we've been as generous as we could come to be conservative in those assumptions and to build that in.So having said all that, I don't think any of that is inconsistent, right? We were growing double digits. Q4 was disappointing for the reasons we told you and but the rest of the portfolio continues to be strong. We're going to strengthen up that ortho side of the business and I get all cylinders on it.Okay."", ""Matthew Oliver O'Brien"", ""And then on the margin side of things. You know, again backing off here a little bit too for the full year, it's just it seems like the Q1 number is well below what I was expecting from a gross margin perspective. So maybe just talk about line of sight on improving that metric so dramatically throughout the course of this year. And then I know you said, approaching 60% next year, but that to 250 numbers was it was a kind of a vivid number for me in my head. Is that another situation where it could be more like a 200 to 250 basis points next year. And I guess why not just go ahead and back off that number now, what is it that you see in the business that we can't see that gets you there.Thank you."", ""I mean, I think we've been very transparent with some of those assumptions. So the there's always seasonality right. I mean, we'd all love for Q1 digit. We'd love for Q4 of the prior year to be the jumping off point and everything always be up and to the right, but that's not how seasonality in margins work. So if you compare Q1 to Q1, we're guiding today to 100 basis points of improvement.I don't know how many companies are guiding that, but so you're but you are correct that it is lower than we thought. 12 months ago, 12 months ago, we said it, we said 150 should be the expectation for 2024 this morning, we're saying 100 to 150 basis points or I'm sorry this afternoon and it builds throughout the year because of these challenges we have on the ortho business, and I'll just remind you, the ortho business is accretive to the Company margins, especially the foot and ankle side of that business. It's in the 80's and we have to it makes some we hoped that our operations in manufacturing would make more progress in 2023 than we did. So there's still more work to do there.So it is it is slower and it backing off a little bit of how we thought 2024 would look 12 months ago, but we're still in the ballpark. And as I said, if Q4 is going to be 150-bps better than that puts you at 58%. And so maybe you don't get all the way to 60% by the end of 2025, but we should be very close and easily get there, you know, in the following quarters. So and you are accurate that it is. I back off a little bit of what we said, but not much. Is it how I would frame it."", 'Understood. Thank you.', 'Operator', ""I'll take you one moment.For our next question.And our next question comes from the line of Kristen Stewart from CL King. Your question, please.Thanks for taking the question."", 'Kristen Marie Stewart', ""I just wanted to go back to AirSeal, not to beat a dead horse, but just to get a little bit better understanding of the exposure there to the business, how much of AirSeal business today is tied to Intuitive Surgical? And what was the conversion rate that I guess you are tracking at today? And what gives you confidence that you're modeling a worst-case scenario going forward?"", ""Thank you, Kristin. Airseal is definitely not a dead horse and unfortunately, the narrative of this competitive threat or a head to head of ForEx. I can tell you we have disclosed in the past that about we estimate that about 60% of our AirSeal revenue is currently associated with Intuitive Surgical procedures. So we're at about 60% today to be clear that doesn't mean we're assuming 30%. That's not the 50% cut. What we're talking about is our historical trend of attachment of new conversions to the robot, and that's what we're cutting have we're not sharing that rate with you today, but we shared the 50% reduction to trying to demonstrate that we've taken this seriously. We haven't been dismissive of it, frankly, I think we've been very I think it's highly conservative. I think I think it's unlikely that, but there's that much much disruption in them in those new systems. But the market is clearly very concerned about it. And we did not think it was wise or helpful to provide guidance that ignored it. And so we've tried to be as generous as we thought was a rational and kind of build that allowance in. But that's as much as I'm going to share with you about the details of that model."", 'Kristen Marie Stewart', 'Okay. And I guess getting back to the gross margin of going close to 60% for 2025, is that also under the assumption of a worst-case scenario of a 50% reduction as well?', ""Or do you think if that?Okay, so you still think that I mean, we're not there with of 20%?Yes, we're not guiding to 2025 today, obviously. But that margin improvement story is very strong and it's bigger than this issue. I would tell you I'll give you a little more color into that model like I said we've assumed, but that's pretty disruptive to us out of the gate. If that all plays out how the narrative is on the street.We also know that if that were to materialize that non-robotic procedures are 10 times the robotic procedures, right? So we would adjust energy resources away from robotic procedures and two non-robotic procedures. If that theory were to materialize that takes time, obviously rates a longer sales cycle. So I would tell you the disruption assumed in the model is bigger early than it is late because the longer we have to adjust and kind of change our sales focus to lead this less disruptive to the overall business is. And so the out years from I'm less worried about than the early years from that perspective."", 'Kristen Marie Stewart', ""Okay.That's helpful. Thanks very much."", 'Operator', 'You One moment for our next question.And our next question comes from the line of Vik Chopra from Wells Fargo.Your question, please.', 'Vikramjeet Singh Chopra', ""Hey, good afternoon and thanks for taking the question. Phil, thanks for providing all the color on the guidance and just wondering if you can share what's the boom in your guidance for the rest of the higher growth businesses? And then I had a follow-up, please."", ""No change that. We continue to expect all of our high-growth businesses to perform as they have been. So again, just to make everybody feel comfortable that's over 20% for AirSeal and Buffalo at twice the market for foot and ankle side of the business and obviously, BioHorizons is a geometric type of growth engine. So no change to how we view those growth drivers."", ""Yes, I would just adding on to that point to the conference of the beginning here, we put up slides that talked about the percentage of portfolio that was growing double digit, growing single digits or declining. And if you just look at that mix. It's a pretty healthy portfolio. So that in and of itself underlies history of the business and our portfolio is only getting stronger with new product introductions. So I feel really good about our portfolio, not only the ones we've identified as high growth, but the rest of the portfolio and them our outlook."", 'Vikramjeet Singh Chopra', 'Thanks. And then just a follow-up.I had on bio.Great. Maybe just talk about your view on how quickly the product can grow in 2024 and any thoughts you can share with respect to your approach to the market and competitive strategy? Thank you.', ""Well, I mean, it's still early days for by operation in the marketplace and for Con Ed. And we had said this year would be high single digits and we exceeded that and we feel very good. And part of my script was talking about sales channel expansion in that. That means geographic expansion as registrations and approvals come through, which we've been working on since day one, but it also means leveraging our foot and ankle sales force. We have sales force that we didn't have really until you know right before we acquired bio brace and there's a clinical need in foot and ankle for a product like bio brace. And that sales team is being ramped up, educated trained, and we feel very optimistic that that is a great channel for that product as well.So there's a there's a lot of growth drivers here in our core sports medicine channel for knee and shoulder and candidly, other applications come by the booth on Wednesday at Academy. And you'll see a lot a lot of surgeon presentations related to bio brace. The lung. Our outlook on this is really exciting because it's clinically differentiated. It is second generation technology is game-changing for patients and clinicians. And I've said many times, it's the single most contacted product that I have surgeons reaching out to me expressing their pleasure with the product and how it's changed patient outcomes. So lung, we're very optimistic about bridge."", 'Thank you.', 'Operator', 'One moment for our next question.And our next question comes from the line of Mike Matson from Needham & Company. Your question, please.', ""Yes, thanks of. So just in the orthopedics business, I guess I want to better understand what's happening or what happened with the tissue situation. So and obviously, there's some kind of direct impact there from the from the shortage. Can maybe I don't know if you've disclosed before how big a part of the orthopedic sales come directly from sales of that. But then I was also wondering, is there was there some kind of spillover effect where by not having those products that you maybe lose procedures, are these other products that we then sold for those cases?"", ""Yes, Mike, I think I'd go back to what we said last quarter, but also what I think Todd had in his commentary, the VM supply disruption in the MTF portfolio, a smaller part of our business had a bigger impact on margins because of the margin profile, what we highlighted in Q three and what it got better, but not as much as we had hoped was just a general supplier challenge that was impacting a larger portion of our sports medicine and our foot and ankle business Foot and Ankle a little bit different because that's more supplier integration, whereas the standard Sports Medicine business was more just supplier delays and disruptions that But candidly, caught up to us. We thought we had been doing a pretty good job, but as things were moving forward, we had some disruptions. And as you know, in that business, if you don't have the product for the case, you can drive substitute or they find an alternative from a competitor. So we just missed cases and that that was the bigger impact in the quarter that is improving as we exited the year. It's improving in the first quarter and we'll be back fully on offense as we get to Q2 broadly speaking in orthopedics. So I wouldn't get hung up on the MTF portion of that that as Todd said, was more about the margin hit from the revenue hit was more in the general sports medicine side because of lost cases because of supply disruption."", 'Vikramjeet Singh Chopra', ""Okay, got it. Sorry, I guess I heard supply issues. I was confusing that with the MTF thing, but. Okay. And then just you're sure that there's no other competitive issues in that business. I mean, strikers launch a new camera and power tools, and they seem to be doing. Are they well, I mean, I know that the capital, but or any other product launches from competitors that are they are hurting you?"", ""Well, I mean, obviously, sports medicines, one of the most competitive markets out there and it is a game of new product innovation. And I look at our portfolio. And we've we've got new products in the knee, the shoulder, we've got Bayou Bridge that Tom is a platform technology that just candidly makes everything else look better in the portfolio. So our team is on offense with new product introduction as much as anybody. And that's just been part of our planning approach. So I think the supply disruptions are bigger issue right now because when you have supply disruption, it keeps you from being on offense, you got to take care of your existing customers."", 'Vikramjeet Singh Chopra', 'Let alone go after new customers, you have to look at it and you take you one moment for our next question.', 'Operator', 'And our next question comes from the line of Yun Lee from Jefferies.Your question, please.', 'Young Li', 'All right. Great. Thanks for taking my questions. I guess, no, I appreciate you taking a more conservative approach to guidance ahead of the potential competitive launch. And I guess if you were to pivot the US reps selling focus, wondering how long would that process take on? What would the reps be doing DIFFERENT?', ""Yes, it's a theoretical question, Jan but I think the really short answer is if I'm a sales professional and I'm used to selling AirSeal behind the wake of an intuitive surgical robot and for whatever reason I don't get that opportunity. I still have a quote. I still have a quarter that dictates how much I'm paid and how much I make.And if I know the opportunity means they have got to turn down the other Hall and go into general laparoscopic room and work on converting more customers. It's going to be a longer sales cycle. They get there really quick because it had some in the it hit some in their paycheck. So they get there really fast trust that Con Ed has been messaging this opportunity for a long time.And you see that being successful outside the US where there's less robots, it's just the US market has a lot more robots on it. And it's some it's a quick pathway that our team as learned and it's where SurgiQuest started back in 2008. I want to be very fair to that sales team. We have a great selling organization in Advanced Surgical.That business had a record year. It'll probably have another record year this year. It's selling the entirety of the portfolio. It's selling Buffalo Filter. It's selling AirSeal, some selling anchor tissue retrieval bags at selling manual instruments at selling energy and argon platforms all to the core customer in general surgery and dumb, we put the conservative guidance and I stood in front of our sales force and ask them specifically question, are you how are you feeling about your position with AirSeal relative to any other competitive entrants in the marketplace and not one of them is backing down. So we're being conservative on our guidance to you inside the business. The team is full charge, full speed and depth. My expectations are very high for that business."", 'Young Li', ""I appreciate that. Maybe there's one more just on a smoky back legislation headwinds in 2024 and what are the key states coming online what are the key ones for 2025 that we should be focusing on also?"", ""Yes, I can't. I can't personally unlike the young, right? I mean, we know who's has things in the works. For example, we thought Texas might be the next state to sign something. They did not get that done before their legislative session adjourned.So that will be hopefully taken up in their next session. And the other states that we show that have something in the works that could be close are Massachusetts, Pennsylvania, West Virginia, Virginia, North Carolina, and Florida. So some pretty sizable states in there.But I can't tell you by quarter or who's going to be first. And but it know, we would not be surprised if those that I just named off announce something in 2024. We also wouldn't be shocked if some of that drug out into 2025 is weak as we've experienced with others.So still really good activity. We've got if I have there, it really hasn't been there wasn't any states that announced since our last call, California was the last one that announced. But the states that have announced something represent 44% of the US population. And so there's still good momentum and a lot of states on OnDeck, but I can't predict timing, I think.Thank you."", 'Operator', 'One moment for our next question.And our next question comes from the line of Travis Steed from Bank of America. Your question, please Hey, thanks for taking the question.', 'Travis Steed', ""Just curious is until I started talking to their customers that you guys have learned anything new on the design or if it's still low pressure and you're still sticking with it being standard installation."", ""And that's the key thing here, and I've never heard them talk to their customers about it. I haven't heard him talk about it on their earnings call, we talked to we have a lot of similar shared key opinion leaders. And so I think we have a pretty good view of what they're bringing to market, which we very specifically highlighted at the end of the second quarter earnings call.We know they talk to their sales team about it at their sales meeting as was publicly reported by many, but we work very closely with Intuitive with AirSeal and their training programs. And I do not believe there's anything in the marketplace or anything coming to the marketplace that is even in the same ZIP Code as AirSeal."", ""Then I'll end there, Kina and there, Kurt, I just wanted to be clear for those that are listening when Kurt says that we know they talked about it to their sales force, they talked about their new robot to the sales force. And if you listened to what they said public, right? And what they're focused on what solutions this new product is supposed to address.There was no mention from Intuitive about insufflation. So this is not a new insufflation robot there solving many other problems that are focused on. I think it is safe to say that insufflation is not on their top 10 list of features of this robot. The shorts on Con Ed has made it about it. Insufflation robot. Intuitive has never framed it that way.And Travis, I want to correct something. You said so that the audience is not confused. You said it's still low pressure. It has never been low pressure. There is zero evidence anywhere that is low pressure. That is an imagination. So there is no evidence that it's a low pressure device. All the evidence would suggest that if they do integrate insufflation, it would indeed be what is referred to as standard insufflation like everything that exist on the market today. That's what all the evidence points do. There is zero evidence to suggest that this product will compete clinically with AirSeal"", ""And the electronic world of people centered around images of two inflators hooked up, and that's how they're going to get to low. I got news for folks that stuff's been around for a long time. There's nothing in the market that's anywhere near AirSeal and has the volume of patients and the clinical studies behind that AirSeal has. So there's no there's no one more anxious for the robotic company to get this device in the market. So we can demonstrate once and for all, there is no risk here to the AirSeal franchise."", 'Travis Steed', ""Thanks for the thorough answer. And sorry, I'm sorry, I thought I may have misspoken question. I got it backwards. But the follow-up question I wanted to ask was on the capital revenue in the quarter was a little light versus Street expectations. And I think the businesses you're talking about the weaknesses and in Q4 were more recurring revenue and not capital. So just capital light in your mind in Q4 just curious if there's any one-time things and the capital thing to talk about this quarter?"", ""I'm sitting in my chair. I did not think capital was late in the quarter. I am I looked at our business in detail it,"", ""I mean not capital grew 43.8% in the quarter. Single-use products grew 29.2%. And now it is I will say the ortho business that is having the challenges right now is a higher capital business than the general surgery business.That's a kind of 30%, typically capital business. But overall, our capital growth was faster than our disciplined focus. And some of the some of the challenges in Q4 were in the capital side of the business in terms of the ortho side or the other impact that I kept.Okay. No, that's helpful clarification. Thank you.Thank you."", 'Operator', ""This does conclude the question and answer session of today's program. I'd like to hand the program back to you, Curt Hartman for any further remarks."", 'Thank you, Jonathan.

If you have an additional query or follow-up, please feel free to rejoin the queue. I would now like to turn the call over to Owen Thomas for his formal remarks.', ""Owen Thomas: Thank you, Helen, and good morning, everyone. After a brief review of our quarterly and annual performance, I intend to focus my remarks this morning on BXP's significant capital allocation activity over the last quarter, related real estate capital market conditions and key areas of focus for us in 2024. The operating trends I've described in prior quarters, specifically the steady return of workers to their offices, the importance of corporate earnings growth to leasing activity and the outperformance of premier workplaces, all remain important and substantially unchanged. BXP continued to perform in the fourth quarter as we did throughout 2023, despite withering negative market sentiment for the commercial real estate sector."", 'Our FFO per share was $0.01 above market consensus for the fourth quarter and for all of 2023, was $0.15 above the midpoint of the guidance range we provided one year ago. We completed over 1.5 million square feet of leasing in the fourth quarter and 4.2 million square feet of leasing for all of 2023, well above our prior forecast. Over the last year, signed leases remain long term over eight years weighted average and portfolio occupancy remained stable, despite a challenging leasing environment. In 2023, BXP raised over $4 billion in new capital in the public unsecured debt, private secured mortgage and private equity markets. In the fourth quarter alone, we completed a new $600 million mortgage financing, a $750 million asset-specific equity capital raise, both among the largest comparable transactions completed in our sector last year as well as three new and highly accretive equity investments, one of which closed in January.', 'So on capital allocation activities and starting with capital raising, last November, BXP announced the sale to Norges Bank Investment Management of a 45% interest in 290 and 300 Binney Street, both life science developments located in the Kendall Square District of Cambridge, leased on a long-term basis to creditworthy clients. 300 Binney is a 236,000 square foot existing office building that is being converted to lab use and scheduled for delivery at the end of this year, and 290 Binney is a 566,000 square foot ground-up development that we expect to deliver in 2026. Our partner purchased the assets at a gross valuation of $1.66 billion or $2,050 per square foot and an expected initial cash yield on cost at delivery for both assets of 5.9%.', ""BXP will retain a 55% interest in each joint venture and provide development, property management and leasing services. Norges has closed its investment in 300 Binney and funded $213 million, and we expect the 290 Binney joint venture will close in the first quarter of this year, which will reduce approximately $534 million of BXP's development funding requirement over time. We are pleased and honored to grow our important relationship with Norges, BXP's largest joint venture partner and one of our largest shareholders. Upon completion of this transaction, BXP will have raised just under $750 million of equity capital on attractive terms and reduced our forecast leverage. Next, BXP purchased interest in three currently owned assets from two different joint venture partners, one of which closed in early January."", ""These transactions were sparked by anchor client renewals BXP achieved at two of the assets, requiring capital for tenant improvements, leasing commissions and building upgrades. In the current environment, these two joint venture partners decided they wanted to reduce their exposure to office. We agreed to purchase their interest at attractive and accretive returns and complete the long-term lease extension. Regarding the specific deals, 901 New York Avenue is a 548,000 square foot, 83% leased office building located in Washington, D.C. The building is encumbered by a $207 million mortgage, with attractive terms due in 2025. In January, we completed the renewal of the 214,000 square foot anchor client in the building, Finnegan Henderson for 18 years, purchased the 50% interest in the property we didn't own for $10 million and modified the loan to allow for an extension of the maturity date for up to five years."", ""Pricing for the acquisition was $414 per square foot and a 6.4% initial cap rate on an as-is basis, and $516 a square foot with an expected 8.4% cash yield on cost at stabilization in 2027. Santa Monica Business Park is a 21 building 1.2 million square foot and 88% leased office complex located adjacent to the Santa Monica Airport. The property is encumbered by a $300 million mortgage due in 2025, and 70% of the park is encumbered by a ground lease, with above-market ground rent and a fee purchase option in 2028. We completed a 467,000 square foot lease renewal for Snap, the anchor client in the park for 10 years, and purchased the 45% interest in the asset we didn't own for $38 million, which represents pricing of $395 per square foot and a 9% initial cap rate on a fee simple basis based on market assumptions for land value."", 'Lastly, in conjunction with the Santa Monica Business Park buyout, BXP purchased a 29% interest in 360 Park Avenue South for $1, bringing our ownership interest in the asset to 71%. 360 Park Avenue South is a 450,000 square foot office building that BXP is fully redeveloping in Midtown South and is encumbered by a $220 million mortgage. We purchased 360 Park Avenue South using OP units priced at $111 per share in 2021 and subsequently introduced two financial joint venture partners, who secured their interest by funding the required redevelopment capital expenditures over time. At the time of closing, the selling joint venture partner had funded $71 million, and BXP assumed their remaining $46 million projected funding obligation. This investment represents pricing projected at building stabilization in 2026 of $754 per square foot and a 7.2% initial yield on cost.', ""So in summary, for these three acquisitions, BXP invested only $48 million upfront and materially increased its ownership position in three high-quality assets we understand well. We expect to receive projected total returns that will be well in excess of the cost of the equity capital we've raised from the Binney Street joint ventures, and project FFO per share accretion from the investments of approximately $0.14 in 2024. Regarding the broader private equity capital markets, office sales volume picked up in the fourth quarter to $14.4 billion, up 126% from the prior quarter and up 14% from a year ago. Interestingly, office sales went from 12% of total real estate transaction volume in the third quarter to over 27% last quarter. Though U.S. lenders continue to reduce exposure to office real estate, making secured financing extremely difficult to arrange, there is more distressed asset restructuring activity, more capitulation on pricing by owners and more confidence by buyers in their forecast cost of capital."", ""The Fed's announcement late last year that interest rate hikes are likely over and cuts could start to occur in 2024 is very favorable for real estate capital market conditions. There were a few comparable premier workplace transactions completed last quarter other than our Binney Street joint ventures. One Westside and Westside Two in West L.A. sold for $700 million or over $1,000 a square foot, and a 6% cap rate to a user, but the economics are influenced by a lease buyout from the existing anchor tenant. Now turning to BXP's priorities for 2024. Our overriding goal is to leverage our competitive advantages to preserve and build FFO per share over time. Today, the key advantages for BXP are our commitment to the office asset class and our clients, as many competitors disinvest in the sector, a strong balance sheet with access to capital and the unsecured debt and private equity markets and one of the highest quality portfolios of premier workplaces in the U.S. assembled over several decades of intentional acquisitions and development."", 'Our primary focus for 2024 will be leasing, preserving and building overtime our occupancy in addressing near and in some cases, medium-term lease expirations, with our portfolio 88% occupied, leasing vacant space is our least capital-intensive way to build back FFO. Doug will focus his comments on leasing markets and our expectations for leasing this year. A second focus for 2024 is new investment activity, many office owners are facing existential risks, given slow leasing and limited secured financing and many institutional owners want to diversify away from the office asset class. We said last quarter, we intended to shift to offense on capital deployment and this has started, given the three new investments I described. There are and will be significant additional investment opportunities available from both lenders and owners of property.', 'Our focus will remain in our core markets on premier workplaces, life science assets and residential development. During the last market downturn caused by the global financial crisis, BXP was able to acquire premier workplaces such as the GM building, 200 Clarendon Street, 100 Federal Street and 510 Madison, all at attractive prices at the time. A third area of focus for us this year will be new development, we have two possibly three residential development opportunities under control that are being entitled and designed and we intend to raise joint venture equity capital for these projects in the second half of the year. We also continue to have dialogue with anchor clients for sites under control in Manhattan, though the discussions are in early phases and the outcomes are much less certain.', 'Significant pre-leasing, higher expected development yields and joint venture equity would be required to launch any new premier workplace developments. We also have several specific sites and buildings that we are trying to re-entitle in advance for near-term viable use based on market conditions. BXP continues to execute a significant development pipeline with 10 office, lab, retail and residential projects underway. These projects aggregate approximately 2.7 million square feet and $2.4 billion of BXP investment, with $750 million remaining to be funded after closing the 290 Binney Street joint venture and are projected to generate attractive yields in the aggregate upon delivery. We will be opportunistic with dispositions in 2024. Market conditions are generally unfavorable for selling assets at attractive prices, but we are interested in raising capital through asset sales if favorable opportunities present themselves.', ""To summarize, in the face of strong negative market sentiment, BXP executed well in 2023, leasing over 4 million square feet of space, raising over $4 billion of capital and launching 2 large-scale fully pre-leased life science developments. We displayed resilience with stable occupancy and a stable dividend and our FFO per share is higher today than it was before the pandemic started in 2020. So we start the year with continued challenges in the leasing market, BXP is well positioned to gain market share in both assets and clients during this time of market dislocation. As a last closing remark, today represents a BXP milestone, this will be Bob Pester's last earnings call as he is retiring from BXP next month, after more than 25 years of service."", ""Our San Francisco region grew significantly under Bob's capable leadership. Thank you very much, Bob. You will be missed by all of us at BXP. Over to Doug."", ""Douglas Linde: Thanks, Owen. Good morning, everybody. After a moment of silence to Bob, I'm going to start. In early 2023, we established our baseline leasing expectations for our portfolio of about 3 million square feet in flat occupancy. As Owen commented, we ended the year with 4.2 million square feet and the fourth quarter included our 467,000 square foot early renewal with Snap at Santa Monica Business Park. We executed about 500,000 square feet more than we expected in 2023 and it was primarily pulling forward some 2024 transactions. The Snap lease was part of our baseline expectations and interestingly, it was only 1 of 2 leases in excess of 130,000 square feet that we executed in the portfolio during the year. On 12/31/22, so over -- just over a year ago, our in-service occupancy was 88.6% and we finished the year, 12/31/23, at 88.4%, essentially flat."", 'Our in-service portfolio is 49 million square feet, so 20 basis points amounts to 98,000 square feet sort of a rounding era. Maintaining portfolio occupancy in the current environment is an accomplishment in its own right. Our large lease expirations in 2024 are 200,000 square feet at 680 Folsom, 230,000 square feet at 7 Times Square, where we own 55% and 230,000 square feet at Carnegie Center and they all occur in the first half of the year. A few comments on WeWork. We are actively engaged in lease modification discussions at our 4 units, Dock 72 in Brooklyn and our 3 sites in San Francisco. Our occupancy expectations assume, we reach agreements that result in a smaller overall footprint and a reduction to the $33 million of rent they are currently paying.', ""It is obvious that WeWork emerges from bankruptcy as an operating business that is positioned for success. Mike will discuss the impacts in his same-store property performance for 2024. In '23, the U.S. office [ph] markets experienced negative leasing absorption. This included the BXP coastal cities, as well as the major Sunbelt and Midwest markets, basically everywhere. How are we thinking about the broad market for '24? If you look at the most recent labor statistics, while the U.S. added 216,000 jobs in December, only 5% were categorized as professional and business services, a.k.a. true office using jobs. The pace of job reductions related to the slowdown in the business economy has slowed, but we continue to see employee layoff announcements across a wide variety of industries, particularly technology."", ""The U.S. economy may not enter a technical recession, but no one should assume that the soft landing is going to stimulate a pickup in office-using employment. Operating in this macro environment, it's hard to envision any dramatic pickup in market leasing absorption in '24. We think overall earnings growth for our clients and potential clients will improve and are optimistic it will lead to employment and space additions just not right away. However, we're not counting on a market recovery to maintain BXP's occupancy. Our leasing, construction and property management teams will lean in on our operating prowess to gain new clients and market share, as clients choose premier properties that are in sound financial conditions for their workplaces."", ""This is how we release known explorations and cover vacant space. The bifurcation of client demand between the East Coast and the West Coast continues to be very wide. San Francisco, West L.A. and Seattle are dependent on technology employers. Traditional technology demand growth continues to be weak and more times than not renewing technology clients are reducing their lease premises. Snap is a case in point. We were successful in executing a forward-starting 10-year lease extension commencing in '26 for 467,000 square feet. However, the transaction does include an early termination of 140,000 square feet at 12/31 24. We can't require clients to lease more space, but we can meet their workplace needs. The leasing excitement on the West Coast in '23 was all about growth from AI organizations in the city of San Francisco, where we saw over 1 million square feet of positive absorption from the industry in the San Francisco CBD in '23."", ""There have been billions of dollars of recent investment in this growing ecosystem, and there are additional clients in the market, but let's acknowledge that, these other AI organizations are predominantly seed or early round funded entities and not at the same scale as an OpenAI or an Anthropic. Their leasing is focused on small footprint built opportunities that are available at significantly discounted terms relative to rents being achieved in Premier. However, all demand is good demand in San Francisco if it translates into absorption. The Seattle CBD continues to have very little active demand other than lease exploration-driven exploration. Our vacancy in Seattle increased by about 100,000 square feet in the second half of '23, due to WeWorks termination, as well as the give back of a floor from a technology company as part of a 5-floor lease extension at Madison Center again, technology-company staying with us in our portfolio, but reducing some space."", 'The entertainment industry, union contract settlements are clearly a positive for West L.A., but there continues to be pressure from streaming profitability, industry consolidation and job reduction in the gaming and media space that is impacting overall demand growth. The concentration of the strongest user demand, which will be the source of occupancy pickup, is still broadly speaking, asset managers, including private equity, venture hedge funds and specialized fund managers and their financial and legal advisers. These organizations are the heart and soul of our New York City activity and are an important sector of the Boston and San Francisco CBD demand as well. In some instances, these clients are growing their teams and capital under management, but in many cases or in all cases, they want to occupy premier workplaces.', ""To illustrate the point, during the quarter, we completed a 25,000 square expansion for an investment bank in Manhattan, a 17,000 square foot lease with a foreign bank that's relocating to one of our other properties in Manhattan, a 10,000 square foot lease with a venture capital firm that's relocating to Embarcadero Center, a 30,000 square foot renewal with a private equity firm at Embarcadero Center, a 74,000 square foot renewal with a law firm in Embarcadero Center and a 15,000 square foot renewal with a long-only manager in Boston. This is where the demand is going to come from. Our strongest activity remains in our Midtown Manhattan portfolio, the Back Bay of Boston, the urban cores of Reston Town Center in Northern Virginia and our Embarcadero Center assets in San Francisco."", 'This quarter, we executed leases of about 74 transactions. We signed 37 lease renewals, 37 leases with new tenants. There were 8 contractions and 9 expansions among our existing clients, with a net reduction of about 100,000 square feet across those 17 transactions. If you exclude Snap, the number is actually a positive 40,000 square feet. The bulk of the transactions were on the West Coast and the majority of the expansions were in New York City. Total leasing volume this quarter was led by New York at 567,000 square feet, then 468,000 in L.A., 198,000 in San Francisco, 153,000 in Boston and 140,000 square feet in the greater Washington, DC area. I would highlight two leases that were executed this quarter. First, the Pratt Institute entered into a long-term lease for 63,000 square feet at Dock 72, a real accomplishment for the New York team and DoorDash executed 115,000 square foot lease, including 57,000 square feet of expansion at 200 Fifth Avenue, again, in Manhattan.', ""The mark-to-market of the leases that commenced this quarter, meaning they hit our revenue, was flat as reported in our supplemental. The overall mark-to-market of the starting cash rents on leases executed this quarter, relative to the previous in-place cash rents was down 1.8%. The starting cash rents on leases we signed this quarter on second-generation space were up 7.5% in Boston, flat in New York, down 15% in D.C. and overall on the West Coast down 3%, but the San Francisco CBD was still up 9%. At the end of the quarter, we had signed leases that had yet to commence on our in-service vacancy, totalling approximately 750,000 square feet, with 625,000 square feet anticipated to commence in '24. Our pipeline of active leases under negotiation sits at just under 1 million square feet today."", ""We have only one transaction currently in negotiation over 70,000 square feet. Comparing this to last quarter, we were at 1.2 million square feet of active discussions at the same time and included the 467,000 square foot Snapdeal. We've seen an uptick in the number of active deals, but the size is smaller. For modelling purposes, our 2024 leasing activity is anticipated to be about 3.5 million square feet. As of January 1st, 2022, so going back two years, our total expirations for '24 totalled 3.5 million square feet. On January 1st, 2024, we have 2.7 million square feet of current expected expirations. If we renew 25% of the remaining 2024 expirations or 675,000 square feet, it means we will have renewed about 43% of our expiring square footage, which is sort of in line with our historical averages."", ""We have executed leases on 625,000 square feet of vacant space commencing in '24. So effectively, we need about 1.4 million square feet of leases that we have yet to execute on 2024 vacant space to have a rent commencement during the year to maintain a flat occupancy. That's what is built into the model and into Mike's same-store. As we look forward into the year 2024, we expect to have sticky occupancy defined as 20 basis points plus to minus 120 basis points negative at the year, and that also factors in some tenant defaults in addition to contractual expirations. During the year, we will have property additions and subtractions to the portfolio. These are not included in the current portfolio occupancy guidance. As an example, in the fourth quarter of '24, the two Waltham Life Science developments will join the in-service portfolio."", ""Their 32% leased and include 300,000 square feet of vacant space that will hit the reported vacancy, that's not part of our projections. We're just looking at our intra-service portfolio as of today. And as long as we're on the topic of life science leasing, new life science activity across our two markets as well as our entire portfolio, continues to be light. During the quarter, we actually had 137,000 square foot known exploration of a life science lease in our Waltham portfolio, which impacted our sequential occupancy and there were no new leases signed in South San Francisco at 651 Gateway. In Waltham, we are seeing some tour activity and have made some proposals, but potential clients don't feel a sense of urgency to make a quick decision."", ""Before Mike discusses our 2024 guidance, I want to make one additional comment around the cost of potential new developments that Owen described. We are seeing more competitive pricing in tenant improvement projects. We've not experienced deflation in material prices or labor, but it's true that there is less work, and we believe that this has resulted in lower pricing from the various subcontractors, who want to maintain a certain size of business. As we think about new base building construction costs, we're hopeful that escalation is no longer part of the conversation and that the same pressures will result in bids that allow us to consider moving forward. However, there are lots of infrastructure projects as well as institutional construction that is filling a portion of the void from lower commercial construction in our markets."", ""Capital costs still haven't received. Construction financing requires a significant capital charge for lenders and obviously results in a higher margin on top of the underlying SOFR. Everyone has a view on the timing and depth of Fed Red rate cuts, but if SOFR goes to 4%, construction financing, if you can arrange it, it's still going to be very expensive and a significant drag on new construction starts. Current market rents and concessions associated with available existing space don't support office -- new office development. To a potential client that requests a proposal for new construction understands it will involve appropriate lease economics to justify the new capital requirements. So Mike, it's time to talk about the quarter and guidance for '24."", ""Michael LaBelle: Great. Thanks, Doug. Good morning, everybody. So this morning, I plan to cover the details of the fourth quarter and our full year 2023 performance, but I'm going to spend most of our time describing our 2024 initial earnings guidance that was included in our press release, with additional details in our supplemental financial package. So for 2023, we reported full year FFO of $7.28 per share and that was $0.02 per share of the midpoint of our guidance range provided last quarter and $0.01 above Street consensus. Owen described the strong 1.5 million square feet of leasing activity in the quarter, and included in this is 270,000 square feet within our unconsolidated joint venture portfolio, where we generate leasing commissions that exceeded our budget by $0.02 per share."", 'We also outperformed our guidance for the quarter with $0.02 per share of lower net interest expense. There were two real reasons for that. Last quarter, we announced the closing of our $600 million five-year floating rate mortgage on three of our Cambridge buildings. When interest rates rallied in December, we opportunistically hedged this financing to fix the rate at 6% for the term. This reduced our interest rate by 160 basis points, contributing to lower interest expense in the quarter. Additionally, the closing of the sale of a 45% interest in 300 Binney Street raised $213 million of equity. That transaction closed earlier than we expected, so the interest earned on the cash represents an increase to our net interest guidance. These two items were offset by about $0.02 per share of onetime unbudgeted transaction expenses related to the forming of the joint venture for 290 and 300 Binney Street as well as slightly higher G&A costs in the quarter.', ""Our portfolio NOI performed in line with our expectations, though we did experience a shift from the same property income bucket to termination income. We booked $10 million of termination income in the quarter, which was $7 million higher than our assumption, primarily from WeWork terminating its lease for two floors in Madison Center in Seattle. Our practice is to exclude termination income from our same property results. So the impact caused our same-property growth to be slightly negative for the quarter. If you exclude the impact of the termination income, our same-property performance actually would have been roughly flat. So with that, I'm going to turn to our 2024 guidance. On a high level, our 2024 guidance can be summarized as follows."", ""We project growth from the delivery of development and the acquisitions of our partners share in Santa Monica Business Park and 901 New York Avenue, a slight decrease in our same-property portfolio NOI compared to 2023, higher net interest expense due to the persistency of the current high interest rate environment and lower development and management services fee income. I'm going to start with the impact of the acquisitions of our partner's interest in Santa Monica Business Park and 901 New York Avenue that Owen described. 360 Park is still in development, so that transaction has limited impact on 2024 FFO. There are a lot of moving pieces with these transactions from an income and balance sheet perspective, so bear with me for a moment. Including the impact of the incremental debt acquired as well as the loss of fee income earned from our former partners, we project these acquisitions are highly accretive, adding approximately $25 million or $0.14 per share to our 2024 FFO."", ""Noncash components represent about 50% of the incremental FFO pickup and are derived from straight lining the leases and fair valuing the debt and the ground lease at Santa Monica Business Park. If we break that down into the categories for our guidance assumptions, the incremental property NOI is approximately $0.22 per share, and that's offset by the additional interest expense of $0.05 per share and the loss of fee income of $0.03 per share. We will now be consolidating the results from these properties. So starting in 2024, you will see the increase in our consolidated NOI and interest expense and a decrease in FFO from unconsolidated joint ventures and fee income. Also impacting 2024 is the disposition of Metropolitan Square in Washington, D.C. that we transacted last year."", ""Inclusive of interest expense, the transaction is neutral to our 2024 FFO. But we do expect a reduction in property NOI of $0.03 per share, that's offset by a comparable $0.03 per share reduction in interest expense. Turning to development activity. Our development activity includes $550 million of investments that delivered in 2023 and will contribute incremental growth for a full year in 2024. These include 2100 Penn, 140 Kendrick Street and 751 Gateway that are in aggregate 97% leased. We have an additional $665 million in developments that are projected to deliver in the near term that we expect will commence revenue in 2024, but be much more meaningful to our growth in 2025 as they complete their lease-up. In aggregate, we expect our developments to contribute an incremental $35 million to $42 million in 2024 or $0.20 to $0.24 per share."", ""Turning to the same property portfolio. Doug spent time describing our occupancy outlook and the impact of the uncertain economic environment that our clients are dealing with. Most continue to be very cautious around new investments, including space, and our leasing projections reflect this conservatism. We still expect to have a productive leasing year. And as Doug described, we have a large backlog of signed leases and leases and negotiation that will go into occupancy in 2024. We expect an occupancy range for our in-service portfolio of 87.2% to 88.6%. Overall, our assumption for 2024 same-property NOI growth from 2023 is negative 1% to negative 3%. As Doug mentioned, we're in discussions with WeWork on modifications for the remaining four leases."", ""Our guidance assumes -- our guidance includes assumptions for these modifications that comprise 45 basis points of the decrease in our projected same-property NOI performance. As you all should expect, our interest expense will be higher in 2024 with the continued high interest rate environment. We expect floating rates will start to drop in the back half of the year and are modelling 75 basis points of Fed cuts, which is more conservative than the current forward SOFR curve. Currently, floating rate debt is only 5% of our total debt, is comprised of $730 million of mortgages, and we have a $1.2 billion term loan that's currently fixed and the interest rate swap expires in May of 2024. Our liquidity is very strong. We have current cash balances of $1.5 billion and our entire $1.8 billion line of credit is available."", ""We will be using approximately $700 million of cash to redeem our maturing 3.8% $700 million unsecured bond that expires tomorrow. Other than that, we have no meaningful 2024 debt maturities without extension provisions, so we're not projecting significant changes in our debt profile. Our only external funding need is approximately $600 million of development spend in 2024 that will be funded with available cash. The majority of the increase in interest expense is coming from our 2023 refinancing activity, resulting in a roll up to market interest rates and the consolidation of the mortgage threat for Santa Monica Business Park and 901 New York Avenue. And lastly, as I mentioned last quarter, our average cash balance will be less in 2024 than it was in 2023, and we expect approximately $30 million of lower interest income."", ""So overall, we're projecting net interest expense of $570 million to $590 million in 2024. We expect consolidated net interest expense to be higher by $72 million at the midpoint, inclusive of the drop in interest income I mentioned. With the consolidation of SMBP and 901 New York Avenue, the interest expense and our unconsolidated joint venture portfolio is expected to be $18 million lower. So this results in a projected increase from year-to-year in total interest expense, including our joint ventures of $54 million or $0.31 per share at the midpoint of our guidance range over 2023. Additionally, the consolidation of Santa Monica Business Park requires us to fair value the above-market ground lease, we project a $10 million positive non-cash impact to FFO from this in 2024."", ""The last item I would like to cover is our fee income projection. We have or will be delivering several joint venture development projects, including our Gateway joint ventures, 360 Park and the Skymark Residential Development. With the delivery of these projects, our development fees are expected to be lower by about $5 million in 2024. Also, we're no longer receiving fees of about $5 million from Santa Monica and 901 New York Avenue, now that they are wholly owned. So our guidance for fee income is lower and is now $25 million to $28 million in 2024. So if you aggregate all of these assumptions, we're providing an initial 2024 FFO guidance range of $7 to $7.20 per share. At the midpoint of our guidance, that's $0.18 per share lower than our 2023 reported FFO."", ""The difference is comprised of increases of $0.19 of incremental NOI from acquisitions and dispositions, $0.22 from our developments, $0.02 of lower G&A expense, offset by $0.26 of higher interest and fair value ground lease amortization, $0.21 of lower contribution from Same Property NOI, $0.08 of lower fee income and $0.06 of lower termination income. At the midpoint, our 2024 FFO results in a modest 2.5% decline from 2023. So despite the economic headwinds, we continue to gain market share with our leasing and operating prowess and premier workplace portfolio, demonstrating relative stability in times of negative absorption. We're optimistic that the interest rate environment will settle at a lower level, providing more confidence in the economy."", ""We're also successfully executing on accretive new investments and continue to focus on additional opportunities to grow our earnings and create shareholder value. That completes our formal remarks. Operator, can you open the line for questions?"", 'Operator: Thank you, sir. [Operator Instructions].

With me today are David Yowan, Navient's CEO; Edward Bramson, Vice Chair of the Navient Board of Directors; and Joe Fisher, Navient's, CFO. Navient has a lot to share with you this morning and has posted two separate presentations that will be referred to during this call. Both are available on navient.com/investors.

Thank you. And now I will turn the call over to Dave."", ""David Yowan: Thanks, Jen, good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining the call and for your interest in Navient. As you know, the Board and management began an in-depth review of our business a few months ago. It's been a rigorous and comprehensive process. I've asked Ed Bramson, Vice Chair of the Navient Board to join me this morning. Ed and I will describe the steps we're taking, the rationale and objectives and what they mean for Navient. After that, Joe will share our Q4 results and 2024 outlook. We will then open it up for Q&A. There are three actions that we're taking coming out of our in-depth review; outsourcing loan servicing, exploring strategic options for BPS, and reshaping our shared service infrastructure and corporate footprint."", ""At a high-level and in the near-term, these actions are intended to simplify our business, reduce our expense base and increase our financial and operating flexibility. Over the long-term, we believe these actions will increase the value shareholders derived from our loan portfolios and the returns we can achieve on our business-building investments. Let me turn to slide two of our strategy update. In May 2023, the executive team and the Board launched an in-depth review of our business to ensure we're on the right path for success and value-creation. This review is confirmed the changes are necessary for Navient to deliver its full value and potential. Our review included an extensive and intensive analysis of costs. We focused on the size, purpose and allocation of all costs by business unit and shared service activities like IT, as well as unallocated costs within our Corporate Other segment."", ""At the same time, we sought to benchmark and compare our costs of important activities including loan servicing to the cost of third-party providers. We analyzed our projected in-house servicing costs over the remaining life of our loan portfolio and compared it to third-party costs through a competitive RFP process. Our current costs were found to be comparable to third-party providers. But it was also clear that our in-house cost to service would not continue to be competitive with third-party costs as our legacy portfolio amortizes and our economies of scale begin to disappear. As a result, we've decided to transition to an outsourced servicing model. Once completed, this will create a variable cost structure for the servicing of our student loan portfolios and provide attractive unit economics across a wide range of servicing volume scenarios."", ""Through our competitive process, we selected MOHELA as our servicing partner. MOHELA is a leading provider of student loan servicing for government and commercial enterprises. We are committed to a seamless transition for our customers in a few months' time. Many of our servicing employees are expected to transfer along with this transaction. Now to our second strategic action. Our in-depth review highlighted that a significant part of our cost base and infrastructure is shared between loan servicing and BPS and especially within BPS' government services business. Both businesses involved many similar activities, such as call center operations, payment processing and omni-channel customer interactions, such as telephony or text, among others."", ""Given the earnings multiple, the market assigns to our shares, our BPS businesses do not receive the value assigned to comparable stand-alone businesses. This limits our ability to realize these businesses full potential and value, such as through larger investments in organic or inorganic growth, for example. Therefore, we are exploring strategic options for BPS, including but not limited to divestments with the goal of realizing the full value and potential of these businesses. We've engaged financial and legal advisers to help us with these efforts and we'll provide updates along the way. Pursuing divestments simultaneously with the decision outsource servicing maximizes the potential for shared cost reduction. We expect to be able to identify and more quickly eliminate stranded costs."", ""Third, we intend to reshape our shared services functions and corporate footprint to align with the needs of a more focused, flexible and streamlined company. We've identified opportunities and some of the steps that need to be taken are included in our 2024 outlook. The full scope and timing of these opportunities will depend on the progress of the outsourcing and potential divestiture transactions. These will define any transition services requirements as well as separation and stranded costs. If you look at our 2023 operating expenses, approximately $400 million, which is net of expected outsourced servicing expenses could be eliminated under a scenario in which we had already completed the three steps we're announcing today. That scenario would also not include BPS revenue under a full business divestiture scenario."", 'We expect to finalize all three actions during 2024. Their implementation is expected to be largely complete over the next 18 to 24 months. With that, let me turn it over to Ed.', ""Edward Bramson: Thank you, David. I think one of the things that David has spoken about that we're actually doing are relatively clear. But what we thought might be helpful today is that for the last 8, 9, 10 years, Navient has been in a steady state. You can predict more or less what it's going to do. And starting in 2025, it's going to be steady state again. So in the coming year is sort of transitional and you could think about it as a turnaround here. And the firm that I'm with invests principally in turnarounds, so we thought it might be helpful to provide some perspective on not just what we're doing, but why we're doing it. And David asked me, I think the word he actually used was delegated me to take you through it from that perspective."", ""So starting on page three, you could obviously say, well, why would the Board look at doing this now as opposed to in the future or having done it in the past. And if you look at the first bullet, it basically says that the share price since the spin-off in 2014 has gone down a little bit. It's not the worst you've ever seen. But I think the Board concluded that it's not a tremendous return for 10 years' work. So the question is, what do you do about it? And as David said, the first step was to do a really solid review of costs. And that project, and I've been involved in quite a few of these turnaround situations was one of the best interactions between Board and management that I've ever seen. So this is a unified approach, and I think it's very well done."", ""The basic issue it had to address is if you think about Navient compared to other companies, a very high proportion of our costs are allocated rather than directly attributable. And what that tends to mean in practice is you always spend a lot of time deciding which bucket the costs should go into, which doesn't leave much time to figure out whether you should have them or not. And this study has sort of broken through that and has provided a lot of useful data. Obviously, it helps with what Dave was talking about in cost reduction, but it also points you to what to do next with capital allocation or growth or whatever. And what is all sort of ends up saying is that for a turnaround, this is somewhat unusual situation. The likely cash that's going to be available in the next few years actually is higher in amount than our entire market cap."", ""So a lot of what the strategic plan will ultimately have to be about is how do you use that wisely. So I would like to take you through our thinking on that. If you go to page four. The major driver of our financial performance since the spin-off had to be the loans we inherited. At the time of the spin-off, there were about $135 billion of loans. And the intention was not to replace them. They were intended to run off. The intention was to do other things with them. And so we have made some efforts in that regard. We've actually generated about $9 billion of new loans. But I think over time and I've gone back and looked at some of the sell-side research, people were probably a little too optimistic about how soon you could start to get to the inflection point when new revenues grew faster than old ones declined."", ""And in reality, as you can see, we've had a runoff of about $90 billion of loans. We've added about $9 billion of new ones. So we might be on track to some inflection points in revenue, but it's not near term. So the inflections to focus on are the ones that David is talking about, which are inflections in earnings or shareholder value. And if you go to page five, I think this helps to put in perspective what we're focused on in the short run. The revenues coming down is not really the principal issue in us. The issue is the operating leverage that creates. And so during the period, as you can see, if you take net interest income, we've had a drop of about $1.1 billion on an annual basis. Our operating expenses have come down by $80 million."", ""There are lots of reasons and background for that, which I won't get into. But whereas the ratio that we're getting here is 15 to 1. Unfortunately, it's a negative ratio, and that's what David's dealing with right now. There's a second contributory issue that comes out of this, which we'll come back to a little bit later on, which is as we thought that the revenue inflection is coming fairly soon, has receded, you tend to get a reduction in the PE multiple, and we'll get into what the consequences of that are in just a second. And if you go to page six. During the period, we did make a lot of investments. We bought BPS, we bought Earnest and some other things. The biggest single investment we made was in share repurchases. And as you perhaps know, we have bought back since the spin-off of about 75% of our original shares outstanding."", ""And that program did what it was intended to do, which essentially was to maintain earnings per share. And the data in the table is a little bit messy. There's a difference between GAAP and core. But I think it's fair to say that if you looked at it, it's maintained earnings flat to slightly up. So it achieved what is intended to do. On the other hand, the problem we've had is because of the change in perception of strategy, the multiple has been coming down. So even though the earnings per share are flat to up, because of our decline in multiple, the share price has come down. That's an issue that we need to deal with as well, and we'll talk about that shortly. So with the joint project and board management done, what are the immediate priorities."", ""The first one is obviously to get your operating expenses down. And there are two elements to that. There's an obvious one, which is that the loan portfolio is, by and large, with one exception, are not designed to be replaced. So every dollar that you spend of overhead on them or other expenses connected with them, just comes out of the value of the portfolio. So our biggest single asset today is the loan portfolios. The less money you spend collecting them, everything else equal the better. I think the more subtle issue is that our major future asset is the businesses we're trying to grow. And in an allocated environment, as the legacy businesses shrink, their allocated costs get reallocated to new businesses, which are the ones you're trying to grow, which can't afford them."", ""So they had the effect of smothering that effort. So that needs to be dealt with. And I think the other thing, coming back to the rising cost of equity is this. If you accept that we're going to have a tremendous amount of cash relative to our market cap to either return to investors or invest over the next two, three years, it needs to be disciplined in how you think about it. So think about it this way. If we take $100 of cash and we put it into an investment and the mix a 10% return, that's $10. At our current multiple, that means market value of $70 for the $100 you put in. That's not viable, you can't do that. So you either have to return that money or come up with something better. So where it leaves you today, and hopefully, this will change is you need to make about a 15% return on equity to justify doing anything and if you do it's sort of a wash."", ""So that as a background, what we'd like to do on page eight. As David said and I think I said at the beginning, this is a strategy update, how to think about the strategy, it's not the strategy. But the strategy is going to be driven by what you have to work with. And on this page, we have the major components of the business. So the loan portfolios, we'll cover in a second. The other items we have, we have quite a large amount of unrestricted cash and we have two operating segments. We have Earnest and we have BPS. And both of those have some interesting aspects to and we'll cover a little bit in brief. If you go to page nine, this is the loan portfolio. Okay. So the first piece of the portfolio is our loan assets. And I think it's important to explain that on our balance sheet, these are consolidated, which makes it a bit difficult to track what they're really worth."", ""In reality, all the loans that almost all the loans that we have are securitized. They reside in trust against which those trusts have incurred some borrowing. So the real economic interest we have in the loan portfolio is what we get from those securitization trust. And that's a combination of future net interest income, servicing fees and the initial equity that we put in that comes back at the end when the trust is liquidated. So if you take those inflows, the table sort of puts together the things that you've seen before, but maybe not in one place. And what it essentially says is that the expected distributions to us from the trusts are about $13 billion. Against that, we finance it in part with unsecured debt, which is a little less than $6 billion."", ""So there's somewhere in the region of $7 billion to come in from those trust over time as we speak. And about half of that looks like it comes in, in the next five years. However, it does cost some money to get from there to what shareholders receive. And so if you want to maximize that value, you need to deal with loan servicing expense, corporate overhead and the interest on our liabilities. We think there are opportunities in all of those areas. And I think Dave is already lining out for you what they're in servicing and corporate overhead. The objective here is to give you a realistic view of what these things are worth. We need to be able to give you all the data which we don't have yet. So hopefully by the end of the year, we'll be able to line all of that out."", ""David covered the outsourcing. I just want to say briefly on page 11 what the environment and what the decision that created it is. When that negative was spun off, it had 12 million borrowers, Half of them were serviced for the education department, the other half were our loans. So as you move along probably 2/3 of the loans were financed for the education department, much larger infrastructure that we require for what we do today. So surprisingly, and this is a real complement to the management team. When you benchmark it, our servicing costs are very competitive today. The problem, as David said, as the base shrinks, they're going to get less competitive. So there is an option to go ahead and invest in a small and more flexible system to deal with that."", ""We think a more desirable option is outsourced to somebody who has scale. The expectation, therefore is not that we're going to save a lot of money on servicing in the short-term because we are competitive, but as the portfolio shrinks, the benefits become very large by making it variable. So that's the loan portfolio. On page 12, there's another item on restricted cash. And I think the way to look at this is it's not part of the loan portfolios, but it goes with it. And the reason we have all the cash you see on the charts here is that it's a liquidity buffer for the large loan maturities that we have coming up periodically. And so it's always been there. However, it's not always easy to get this out of the financials, it's unrestricted cash that's available for general corporate purposes and it belongs to the shareholders."", ""And as at the end of '23, that's about $7.50 a share of cash that belongs to the shareholders. In fact, if you look at some other liquid assets that we have in addition to cash, it's more like $10 a share. So if you think about that and if you think about the potential inflows from the loan portfolios, that's why I was saying earlier that even if you don't sell BPS, you're going to be having cash available for distributions or investments that's actually in the next few years, equal to more than our entire market cap. So obviously, the key to the situation is to do that wisely. So if you go to page 13, I think from what I said earlier, it's sort of obvious in which circumstances you would just return cash to shareholders. But here's an example of some things that are going on at Navient under the hood that perhaps aren't well highlighted."", ""So what I'm going to take is Earnest. And Earnest is something we bought five years ago or so. But the point is that it's a new brand to Navient. And it's customer-focused, and it's designed to focus on relationships. And what we mean by that is a relationship is something that causes a customer to come back for another product after he got the first work. The reason you want that is enables you to build attractive lifetime economics with customers. In that sense, it's distinct from the Navient brand. There's nothing wrong with the Navient brand, but it's a servicing brand. So the interaction you have with it is collecting a loan that might have been written by the education development or maybe it's one of our own ones. We do the best we can to treat you properly."", ""We try and be efficient and sympathetic to state necessary. But at the end of that relationship, you don't expect to see us again. So it's not the right sort of brand to build a business in the future. So Earnest has been going for a while, is now running at a bit less than $200 million a year of revenue. It's principally focused on education industry types of products at the moment. Our objective is to move that out into a broader set of product lines at some point in the future. But what we have today is a lending business which has generated essentially all our new loans in recent years, which is highly efficient and we'll tell you about it in a second. There's another part of our industry, which we're calling a financial counseling platform, really for lack of anything more imaginative to call it."", ""And in my own work in engineering, this would be the difference between saying what something is and what it does. So financial counseling is what it is. What it does is that it enables us to address a much broader base of customers than we have today to build our relationships potentially for the future and also to develop data for the sorts of things you might do next. But the management team at Earnest is quite a bit younger than some of the other management at Navient. And one of the things that they've done, I think, quite well is to resist some pressure to monetize this business too soon. So it does generate a little bit of revenue. But the way to think about it is it's all paid for within Earnest operating budget. So just quickly covering the brand point."", ""As we said, we're trying to target a certain kind of customer, trying to target them efficiently. What's on the page here is that Navient periodically does a brand health survey. There are 11 brands in here. One of them is Navient one of them is Earnest the other nine are competitive companies. And there are lots of attributes. We just picked some of them. But as you know, generally speaking, financial services companies are not super well-liked by their customers. But if you look at these attributes, what find is that Earnest and its dealings with people is perceived as being fair, is being ethical, being reliable. What is not perceived as is being aggressive or arrogant. So if you come back to the efficiency of acquiring customers, if you treat them properly, they come back and that's much cheaper than getting a new one."", ""So that's the point I think we will turn. So just to give you a bit of an insight into how our industry is doing. On the lending side, the principal thing it does is graduate loan refinancing at the moment. There's 5% to 10% of the in-school lending, but I don't think it's relevant to this discussion. It's not the only thing we want to do, but it's a good place to start and it pays the rent. The reason that's good is it aligns with the sorts of customers you want to get and the characteristics you want, and it's something we know how to do. It's been successful. Our market share in this field is either one or two for most of the last few years, and we've generated about $9 billion of loans here. It's also now quite profitable that went from a loss in 2020, about $8 million to making about $80 million pre-tax today."", ""The counseling platform, I think the point to make here is that over that time, it's grown fourfold, a bit more so. And so you are almost 2 million users. Earnest has probably 150,000 customers. So it's multiples of people that you have relationships with above those that you actually currently lend to you today. The reason that's important is that there may be future customers, but coming back to a point we made earlier, we're looking at product loan extensions. And the most economical way and least risky way of doing that is to test into those things, to do research, to try them out rather than commit hundreds of millions and find out it was a bad idea. And there's an industry celebrity who I have not met personally, who has, I think, a rather way of interesting way of describing consumer lending."", ""He says, people go into it with wide eyes and they come out with black eyes. So one of the principal values of this platform is to enable us to be judicious as we start to add new products. Then on Earnest itself, its business model, why is it distinct? We talked about the brand. But if you think about financial services, generally, it's very difficult to have a lower cost of funds than other people. Product differentiation is something people talk about, but at best, is fleeting. So neither of those are going to be advantages for us. So what Earnest is focused on is targeting customers who are efficient and then managing that process efficiently. So if you think about a lot of people in the industry generally talk about they say, well, our NIM will be better because we'll charge people more for the same product than other people will get or we'll fund it cheaper than other people can do or our cost of customer acquisition will be less."", ""All of those things are important, but what really counts is the end-to-end deficiencies. So taking a few data points there. Earnest is acquiring customers at an annualized cost of about 30 bps. And what that is, it's a little bit more than a percent to get one you keep in about four years. Another element of efficiency is that we're targeting more affluent customers. So the average balance at Earnest at the moment is about $50,000, which is almost three times what our legacy portfolio is. And in fact, that $50,000 is trending a little bit higher as we speak. And then the other point on here is the realized loss rate. And the 40 bps might sound attractive. It probably is helpful in generating NIM. But the more important point in an end-to-end analysis is all the people you don't chase, you don't have to worry about, you don't have to think about it every day, don't cost you money to manage."", ""And so in terms of efficiency, that's probably the major advantage of targeting those kinds of customers. Just to wrap up on this, because this sounds like a plug, and I have to say that it really isn't because we haven't decided firmly what to do with it or about it. But having said that, we talked earlier about operating leverage. And one of the great things about the project that the guys did is you were able to identify these points of leverage, you do this, you get that in various elements. So Earnest is an example, I think, of positive operating leverage because you have well-controlled costs and you have a growing revenue base. So to put that in context, if you look at Earnest from 2023 to the end of last year, its revenue increased by, I'm going to call it $125 million."", ""Its marketing expenses went up. But if you get more customers, you have to spend more money to get them. What's interesting though is that the other operating expenses went up by about $15 million. So that's a ratio of a little bit better than 8:1. And as you grow, that ratio actually gets better. So what this looks like to us is a classic example of online growth business economics. So it's probably something that you won't want to find a way to expand. So with that not to say that there aren't very interesting businesses within BPS. But that one, as you know, is subject to an analysis of strategic alternatives. So I'm going to turn it back to David, I'm going to get off now. And I'll delegate it back to him."", 'David Yowan: Great. Thanks, Ed. So turning to page 18, let me provide a brief review of our BPS businesses. These businesses operate in two distinct markets with separate operations. Several of the businesses within this group were acquisitions. Our Healthcare business goes to market under the Xtend brand. Xtend offers revenue cycle management services to health care providers and is relatively independent from the rest of Navient from an operational perspective. The government services and transportation businesses operate under several brands and provide a variety of services to federal, state and local governments, its operations share costs, infrastructure and corporate support with the rest of Navient, particularly loan servicing.', ""While we're at an early stage in exploring strategic options for this business, we will keep you updated as that process unfolds. Let me try to summarize on slide 19. We have identified and we're taking steps to significantly reduce the expense base and simplify the company. These actions are designed to increase the value of the cash flows from our loan portfolios and increase the returns and transparency around growth initiatives. The cash we have on hand, the enhanced cash flows from our loan portfolios and the proceeds of any divestiture of BPS combined could generate significant cash flows in excess of our current market cap over the next few years. We will invest that cash in activities that are expected to generate market value in excess of the invested cash."", 'Excess cash will be distributed to shareholders. Shortly following my transition from the Board to the role of CEO, I shared with you my initial impressions from inside the company, namely that Navient has a strong foundation of assets, capabilities and talent. I also said that we would undertake a rigorous review to identify ways in which that foundation can deliver more to shareholders. These actions are the first steps in delivering our full value and potential, and we look forward to providing updates on our progress. With that, I will now turn it over to Joe to review our Q4 results and provide our 2024 outlook.', ""Joe Fisher: Thank you, David, Ed and everyone on today's call for your interest in Navient. During my prepared remarks, I will review the fourth quarter and full year results for 2023. I will also provide more detailed guidance underlying our 2024 outlook for earnings per share of $2.10 to $2.30. Our 2024 outlook does not assume any of the strategic actions that we are announcing. It does not include potential benefits from the transition of servicing, any potential divestitures or any restructuring expenses related to these initiatives. This outlook also assumes a declining rate environment with four rate cuts. We will update our financial outlook throughout the year as these actions become clear. In 2023, we reported a fourth quarter GAAP EPS loss of $0.25, bringing our full year GAAP EPS to $1.85."", ""On a core basis, we delivered fourth quarter EPS of $0.21 and full year EPS of $2.45. The $0.21 includes a $0.49 reduction to EPS related to significant items in the quarter. Before I move on to the segments, I will provide further detail on two of these items. First, we have increased our accrual by $28 million in connection with the CFPB litigation bringing our total accrual to $73 million. We remain confident about the strength of our case, while open to finding a solution that is acceptable to all stakeholders in order to put this matter behind us. Second, in our private credit provision this quarter, we reserved $35 million due to internal policy changes we've made to meet new regulatory expectations related to school misconduct discharges on certain legacy private loans."", ""This increase reflects our assessment of the impact to the legacy portfolios, life of loan discharges from potential borrower claims. I'll now provide additional detail by segment, beginning with Federal Education Loans on slide four. The quarter's NIM of 86 basis points reflects the higher rate environment as floor income, including the amounts that were hedged continued to roll off in the second half of this year. We expect FFELP NIM to decline to the low 70s for 2024 due to our interest rate outlook of four cuts this year. Falling interest rate environment creates NIM pressure as our FFELP assets repriced more frequently than our liabilities. However, we do not forecast rates to fall far enough to reach a level where significant floor income is generated."", 'Our full year FFELP net interest income declined 8% to $480 million as the portfolio balance declined 13% to $38 billion. The full year FFELP NIM of 112 basis points was above our targeted range of 100 to 110 basis points provided at the beginning of the year. Credit metrics improved in our FFELP portfolio compared to the prior year and third quarter. The delinquency rate, forbearance rate and net charge-offs all declined from the prior year. Provision increased from the prior year as longer expected lives primarily driven by a greater percentage of borrowers and income-based repayment plans increases the projected amount of loan premium charged off in the future. The net charge-off rate of 19 basis points for the year was consistent with our expectations of 10 to 20 basis points for the full year.', ""Now let's turn to our Consumer Lending segment on slide five. Net interest margin was 291 basis points in the quarter and 304 basis points for the full year. This exceeded our original guidance of 280 to 290 basis points as we benefited from improved funding spreads. We anticipate that the consumer lending NIM will be in the low 300s for 2024. This includes projected new refi originations of $1 billion compared to $647 million in 2023. It also assumes projected growth of 10% in in-school originations. We expect the increase in refi originations to occur primarily in the back half of the year based on our outlook for a declining rate environment. Our consumer lending team is focused on generating high-quality loans with efficient acquisition costs and improved margins."", 'Credit metrics in our consumer lending portfolio performed as expected with delinquency rates, forbearance rates and charge-off rates relatively flat year-over-year. Our charge-off rate for full year 2023 of 1.5% was at the low end of our original guidance of 1.5% to 2%. Provision of $50 million is primarily driven by the changing regulatory expectations that I discussed earlier in my remarks. This is reflected in our change in allowance on slide six. At the end of 2023, our allowance for loan losses for our entire education loan portfolio is $1 billion. While much of our portfolio is amortizing, we reserved $5 million for FFELP loans during the quarter and $56 million during the year related to a projected extension in the life of the portfolio.', 'New origination volume contributed $4 million to the allowance in the quarter and $25 million for the full year. Continue to slide seven to review our Business Processing segment. Total revenue increased $11 million to $81 million in the quarter as revenue from our traditional BPS services increased $15 million or 23%, more than fully offsetting revenue associated with pandemic-related contracts from a year ago. The full year revenue of $321 million was comprised of $74 million in growth from traditional BPS services and well in excess of the long-term high single-digit growth that we see in the industry. Our full year EBITDA margin of 12% was driven by the onboarding of new government services contracts in the first half of the year. Our EBITDA margin of 15% in the quarter reflects the benefit from ongoing efficiency initiatives as we target high teens EBITDA margins for 2024.', 'Turning to our capital allocation and financing activity that is highlighted on slide eight. We continue to maintain disciplined asset liability and capital management strategies with 84% of our education loan portfolio funded to term and an adjusted tangible equity ratio of 8.2%. During the quarter, we issued $516 million of asset-backed securitizations and $500 million of unsecured debt. We also retired $850 million of maturities that were due in March of 2024. Our overall unsecured debt maturities declined by 16% to under $6 billion, the lowest levels in our history. In the year, we reduced our share count by 13% through the repurchase of 18 million shares. In total, we returned $388 million to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends.', 'We expect the adjusted tangible equity ratio to remain above 8% for 2024. Turning to expenses on slide nine. Total expenses for the year were $825 million. This includes $80 million of regulatory expense primarily related to accruals in connection with the CFPB matter. Operating expenses declined 32% in the Federal Education segment and 10% in the Corporate Other segment when adjusting for regulatory expenses. We achieved an efficiency ratio of 53% for the year, better than our original full year outlook of 55% to 58%. The strategic initiatives we are undertaking reflect our commitment to identify additional and more meaningful opportunities to reduce expenses. In closing, the full year results of $2.45 reflect the steps we have taken to achieve profitable growth, address regulatory matters and maintain strong capital while exploring alternative strategies to maximize cash flows and enhance value for shareholders.', 'Our full year 2024 outlook of $2.10 to $2.30 does not include the impact of strategic initiatives that Dave and Ed outlined occurring this year, though we are confident in our ability to execute on these initiatives. Before I close, I want to thank team Navient for their accomplishments this year and continued commitment to creating further value for all of our stakeholders. Thank you for your time, and I will now hand the call back to Dave.', ""David Yowan: Thanks, Joe. As I said at the outset, we had a lot to share this morning. While we pursue the actions we're announcing today, we remain focused on meeting the needs of our borrowers on growing our BPS businesses by delivering the services our customers and clients seek from us and with Earnest on growing loan originations and building engagement and deepening relationships. We will update you on our progress and call out the impacts within our 2024 results as needed. As they come into sharper focus by the second half of the year, we expect to be able to provide a revised outlook and our going-forward opportunities and plans. I also want to acknowledge and thank my colleagues across the organization who continue to serve our customers and clients."", ""The actions we are announcing today represent significant change. I know that as we navigate these changes, our team members will remain committed to servicing our customers and clients with distinction and care.

Over the course of two summers, starting in 2016, Lightfoot participated in the Verizon Innovative Learning summer program at Jackson State University, where he learned HTML coding for websites, explored the intricacies of computer-aided design (CAD) and was introduced to drone technology. He says this hands-on experience with next-gen tech influenced his current career path and continued interest in STEM. ""I was interested in AI and the ‘simple\' logic connected to coding,"" Lightfoot says. ""Before the program, I definitely didn\'t know about other career possibilities in STEM. It 100% helped my path up to now.""', ""Fast forward to today, and Lightfoot, 19, is a cadet at the U.S. Air Force Academy in Colorado Springs, Colorado. He is majoring in behavioral science, with plans to get his master's degree in management or computer science."", 'For Lightfoot, the Verizon Innovative Learning program was the catalyst that sparked his interest in STEM. The program aims to empower middle school students in under-resourced communities to explore STEM subjects, learn problem-solving skills and gain exposure to career opportunities in technology fields. ""The program was a nice environment for kids to do something at that age,"" Lightfoot says. ""We had a lot of exposure.""', 'Charles Moore, who serves as the instructor for Jackson State\'s Verizon Innovative Learning program, has been with the program since its inception in 2015 and remembers Lightfoot as an advanced student who was hardworking and disciplined. ""Ravion was a very focused student, and he enjoyed thinking outside the box,"" he says. ""He was very creative, and he loved soccer, too.""', ""Lightfoot's favorite part of the Verizon program was attending a three-day summit in San Francisco, where he and about 100 other students saw real-world applications of what they were learning. During the trip, Lightfoot and the other students toured the Verizon Innovation Lab and saw how STEM is used at a film and TV production company, among other STEM-focused activities."", '""At the Verizon Innovation Lab, it was pretty cool seeing a robot balance a ball; it was showing future ideas,"" Lightfoot says. ""We also saw the difference in internet speeds-3G, 4G and 5G. At the end of the trip, they gave us time to go out and explore. It was nice having the freedom to experience that at that age.""', 'After Verizon Innovative Learning, Lightfoot got more involved in other STEM camps, thanks to the support and encouragement of his family and family friends. ""My family kept putting me and my cousin [who also attended the Verizon program] into different programs. That gave me early exposure to STEM and helped me stay interested in it after middle school,"" he says. ""My family is very excited about what I\'m doing now at the Academy.""', 'In high school, Lightfoot continued his STEM journey through various activities, joining a robotics club and competing in the C Spire Coding Challenge. His dedication was recognized with a $40,000 scholarship from a major tech company for students pursuing computer science or engineering. ""I\'m pretty tech savvy,"" he says. ""My tech experience sets me apart.""', 'Lightfoot\'s academic success sets him apart as well. In addition to being a strong student, Junior ROTC cadet, active volunteer and athlete in high school, Lightfoot earned two Gold Keys-the top award-for his art submissions in the Scholastic Art Awards. He also received offers of appointment from the Merchant Marine Academy, the Naval Academy Preparatory School and West Point, though he says he was ""most excited"" about joining the Air Force Academy.', '""I came into the Academy wanting to be a pilot,"" he says. ""I\'d been interested in aviation and planes since I was younger.""', 'This interest began after Lightfoot participated in an after-school club where we got his first chance to fly. The students were introduced to fields such as art and music, and when they got the opportunity to take flight with local pilots, Lightfoot realized how much he enjoyed it.', '""There was an inexplicable sense of joy, excitement and adrenaline when I got up in the air,"" he explains. His interest was so apparent that the program leader connected Lightfoot with one of the pilots so he could work toward getting his private pilot\'s license.', 'When it comes to his current time in the Academy, Lightfoot says one of his favorite parts is the people. ""From the military personnel to civilians-they possess a breadth of high-quality information and life experience that they are more than willing to pass down.""', 'As for his future, Lightfoot is exploring the options that an Air Force education will grant him, whether that\'s becoming a pilot, working in cybersecurity or considering a career with Space Force, the military branch dedicated to protecting U.S. and allied interests in space. ""Overall, I\'m not sure yet,"" he says. ""The job\'s not finished, although, to a fault, I don\'t really pay attention to the small wins. I\'m more focused on the big win of graduating and commissioning.""', 'Whatever he decides, Lightfoot\'s future looks bright. As for advice for younger people hoping to follow in his footsteps, Lightfoot encourages them to take advantage of any opportunity they have to learn about STEM as he did with the Verizon Innovative Learning summer program. ""It\'s good to have early exposure to STEM fields,"" Lightfoot says.

Ranked as one of Canada’s fastest-growing and most innovative companies by Deloitte, Jobber specializes in Cloud Based Business Management Software, Field Service Business Management, Mobile Solutions, SaaS, CRM, Invoicing & Billing, Scheduling and Routing.Verizon has collaborated with Jobber to launch the Field Management Tablet Plus solution. With preloaded Jobber app, the solution is likely to eliminate the time-consuming task of loading software applications on a device-by-device basis. The partnership is expected to be budget-friendly for small businesses as they can receive a single combined bill from Verizon and cut on the cost.Due to the low cost of operations, small and mid-sized home service business owners often do not possess the required budget to provide every employee with secured devices for official usage. As a result, important and confidential client data are left unsecured in their employee’s personal devices. By implementing the Field Management Tablet Plus, which comes preloaded with Verizon Mobile Device Management, businesses can manage tablet deployment and improve their security policies.The collaboration further promotes growth in the business by quoting professional templates with automated quote follow-ups to book new businesses, timely completion of work and timely payment disbursement. The one-stop solution enables all the related stakeholders to be aware of the status and progress of every step.The collaboration is likely to capture a niche market within the home service industry by gaining loyalty from its existing customers as well as attracting new buyers to increase their revenue streamlines.The stock has gained 1.2% in the past year against the industry’s decline of 1.6%.', 'Image Source: Zacks Investment Research', 'Verizon currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.', 'Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts.', 'Earnings Whisper', ""Estimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction)."", 'The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate.

Stanley Black & Decker's performance in 2023 reflects our relentless focus on the execution of our strategic business transformation which resulted in us building a strong foundation for improved profitability in 2024. Stanley Black & Decker today is a more streamlined business built on the strength of our people and culture, with an intensified focus on our core market leadership positions in Tools & Outdoor and Industrial. Despite a challenging market backdrop that pressured volumes during the year, adjusted gross margin improved in each quarter and we generated over $850 million of free cash flow. These results demonstrate significant progress against two of our most important areas of focus during 2023. Here are just a few additional examples of our accomplishments from the past year. We improved the health of our cost structure as a result of the momentum from our supply chain transformation. We achieved our 2023 target and delivered over $1 billion of savings programmed to date. We remain on track for the expected $2 billion of savings targeted by the end of 2025. Our fourth quarter adjusted gross margin approached 30%. This result outperformed the plan as our team's accelerated efforts to deliver profit and cash in response to the soft volume environment. Our strong free cash flow generation was primarily the result of $1.1 billion of inventory reduction as we successfully executed our supply chain initiatives. We continue to actively manage our portfolio of businesses. In December, we announced the agreement to sell our Infrastructure business and currently expect that transaction to close at the end of the first quarter. This aligns with our simplification efforts and focus on shareholder value creation while advancing our capital allocation priorities. We strengthened our leadership team with the addition of 3 new highly-capable, seasoned and respected leaders in Chris Nelson, Pat Hallinan and John Lucas, each of whom brings a fresh and exciting set of perspectives. Stepping back over the past 1.5 years, we have transformed Stanley Black & Decker into a different company, refocused and reenergized. Together, our talented and motivated leadership team, along with our diverse and high-performing associates across the globe are executing our transformation strategy with urgency and diligence to ensure we continue to achieve our goals. Our performance to date is encouraging and reinforces our confidence in making investments to pursue the compelling long-term growth opportunities in the markets that we serve. Shifting now to our fourth quarter performance. Revenue was $3.7 billion, which was down mid-single digits versus the prior year, primarily due to lower outdoor and DIY volume as well as Infrastructure customer destocking. Our profitability exceeded our plan as we recorded adjusted gross margin of 29.8% in the quarter. Adjusted gross margin was up over 10 points versus the prior year and improved 220 basis points versus the third quarter. As a result of our focused efforts, this is the fourth consecutive quarter that we delivered sequential adjusted gross margin improvement. We also reduced inventory by $240 million this quarter, which brings our total inventory reduction to $1.9 billion since mid-2022 when we began this journey. 2024 will be the next chapter of transformation, an opportunity to demonstrate our ability to further improve profitability and cash flow as we plant the seeds for future growth and success for Stanley Black & Decker. While it will be a transitional year, we are continuing to strengthen our foundation to create greater future earnings power. We will remain focused on delivering differentiated product innovation through our portfolio of world-class brands, implementing cost efficiency measures within our control and driving share gain in our core markets, all aimed to improve margin, earnings and cash flow. Turning to the markets we serve. Our view is that these markets will remain dynamic in 2024. Overall, we expect relative strength and demand from professional tools and portions of our industrial markets. However, we believe the consumer and outdoor demand trends will continue to be weak. Together, this results in a modestly negative outlook in aggregate for all of our markets. Our global trade weighted GDP estimates are slightly positive. With U.S. real GDP growth projected to slow but remain positive in 2024, global commercial construction is expected to moderate and industrial tool markets are expected to remain supportive. The global industrial fastener and categories will be led by aerospace, while automotive and industrial production markets will be relatively flat. There are a few key macroeconomic indicators that more directly impact our larger markets in North America, which are somewhat mixed. Examples of this mixed North American Tools & Outdoor market are as follows: new residential builds are forecasted to improve from current levels, yet remain modestly negative year-over-year; residential repair and remodel is currently expected to retract; and the outdoor power equipment industry continues to show signs of customer destocking, and we don't expect to pivot to growth during 2024. In summary, we're focused on the pro user and the healthiest market segments to generate share gains. We are prepared for weak consumer and outdoor demand trends to persist. The midpoint of our 2024 plan represents a continuation of the current demand environment, which, in aggregate, is slightly negative for all markets. We will remain agile and ready to serve incremental demand if it accelerates in the second half. We believe that with our powerful brand and strong innovation machine, we have the opportunity to capture new wins with our customers and outperform the market. Our plan for the year is underpinned by the continued supply chain cost improvements that are broadly in our control. We expect to deliver gross margin accretion, earnings growth and strong free cash flow. Pat will discuss this in more detail in just a few moments. 2024 will be a year of focus, excitement and purpose, and it is fitting that we are celebrating the 100-year anniversary of DEWALT, a noteworthy milestone and a reminder that we have been revolutionizing job sites for a century. We will always relentlessly innovate for our pros and all our end users, allowing them to achieve better, safer and faster results. I want to thank our 50,000-plus employees around the world for their persistence and commitment to our mission in 2023. They each have contributed to the progress we've made on our transformation journey. Now stepping into the business segment results. I will discuss our Industrial business performance and then pass it to Chris Nelson to review the Tools & Outdoor results. Fourth quarter industrial revenue declined 4% versus last year. Price realization was more than offset by lower volume, which was driven by the continuation of customer destocking in Infrastructure. Within the segment, Engineered Fastening fourth quarter organic revenues were up 7%. This includes aerospace growth of 27% and auto growth of 10%, as we benefit from recoveries in those markets. This growth was partially muted by market softness in general industrial fastener.The fourth quarter Industrial adjusted segment margin was 11.1%, down 40 basis points versus prior year as lower volume more than offset price realization and cost control. For the year, we are very pleased with the performance of our Industrial segment. While organic revenue growth was flat, Engineered Fastening, which is our focus moving forward within this segment was up 6% organically behind the strength in automotive and aerospace. The team delivered full year adjusted segment margin of 11.8%, up 210 basis points versus 2022. This expansion was driven by price realization and cost actions taken to improve productivity throughout the year. I want to thank the Industrial business team for their strong execution in 2023. And I'd like to especially thank the Infrastructure team for their valuable contribution to Stanley Black & Decker. I am confident that the business is positioned for a future of innovation and growth with Epiroc. I will now turn the call over to Chris to review our Tools & Outdoor performance."", 'Christopher John Nelson', ""Thank you, Don, and good morning, everyone. Now turning to the Tools & Outdoor fourth quarter operating performance. Fourth quarter revenue was approximately $3.2 billion, down 8% organically versus prior year as a result of lower volumes, primarily from soft consumer outdoor and DIY market demand, while price remained flat. We made substantial progress improving profitability through the year, driving adjusted segment margin to 10% in the fourth quarter. This was a sequential step-up of 70 basis points versus the third quarter and 900 basis points better than the fourth quarter of 2022. We achieved this by realizing lower inventory destocking costs, delivering supply chain transformation savings and capturing the benefits of shipping cost deflation, which were partially offset by lower volume. Now turning to the product lines. Organic revenue for hand tools declined 6%, while power tools was up 1 point organically as pro-driven momentum offset pressures in DIY demand. Outdoor was significantly challenged as customers rightsize their inventory levels. We expect that trend to continue into the start of the 2024 selling season.In Tools, we finished the year with a relatively stable market backdrop supported by pro demand. For example, power tools organic performance improved each quarter in 2023 and exited in a growth position. This demonstrates the demand for our iconic, pro-centric DEWALT brand and the best-in-class products that we are bringing to the market. As the outdoor market achieves post-COVID normalization, we are focused on improving our cost structure while prioritizing investments to capture targeted share gain opportunities with customers and accelerating innovation in handheld electrification, which is a growing and highly profitable category. Now turning to the fourth quarter performance by region. North America was down 10% organically with the tools product lines down low single digits. The commercial and industrial channel, which has a heavy professional user base grew low single digits organically. Fourth quarter U.S. retail point-of-sale demand remained negative versus the prior year, but above 2019 levels, supported by price increases and strength in professional tools.European organic revenue was down 1% with outperformance in the Nordics and Italy, which generated double-digit organic growth as we continue to invest in expanding our professional product offerings and activating new battery-powered innovations within the region. Emerging markets grew mid-single digits organically, excluding the impact from the Russia business exit. Including this impact, organic sales declined 1%. Solid emerging market performance was led by high teens organic growth in Brazil marking the seventh consecutive quarter of organic growth in the country. I want to thank the Tools & Outdoor team for their focused efforts throughout the year, which has positioned us well as we continue to focus on winning with our customers in capturing long-term profitable growth and market share. Now turning to the next slide. I would like to now introduce our new groundbreaking equipment system, DEWALT POWERSHIFT. We are proud to bring this to market later this year as it demonstrates the company's commitment to innovation and electrification for the pros. The DEWALT POWERSHIFT system was unveiled at the World of Concrete trade show last week and is designed to meet the critical needs of concrete professionals. The electrified line will allow the pro to transition away from gas-powered equipment without compromising efficiency and performance. Each of the 6 concrete tools in the system uses the DEWALT POWERSHIFT's 554-watt power battery and high-speed charger to streamline efficiency. The battery can deliver up to 5,000 watts of continuous power. That is equivalent to 6.5 horsepower and is designed to withstand the toughest job site conditions. The POWERSHIFT battery leverages pouch cell technology, which DEWALT first brought to the industry in October of 2021. Pouch technology enables the cordless job site in the future, bringing more power, run time and efficiency. Take, for example, the POWERSHIFT vibrator used for concrete placement. It is 85% more efficient than gas vibrators in the market today. POWERSHIFT vibrators deliver 60 continuous minutes of nonstop work, which gives the user about 30% more run time than a tank of gas. There are electrified vibrators in the market today that can only deliver 15 minutes of run time. Adding to the extended run time, this tool is 5 pounds lighter than a gas unit and is 10 pounds lighter than any other electrified unit available. DEWALT POWERSHIFT represents the next addition to the 100-year legacy of the DEWALT innovation mission to deliver comprehensive end-to-end workflow solutions. Raymond DeWalt's founding principles of innovation, safety and productivity remain the core ethos of our company today. DEWALT's future remains strong, and we will lead the way in empowering tradespeople to succeed while defining the next era of industry innovation and minimizing environmental impact. Thank you. And with that, I'll pass the call over to Pat Hallinan."", 'Patrick D. Hallinan', ""Thanks, Chris, and good morning. Turning to the next slide. I would like to highlight the progress we have achieved, streamlining the business and transforming our operations. We are on track to deliver our $2 billion pretax run rate cost savings target by the end of 2025. We achieved approximately $160 million pretax run rate cost savings in the fourth quarter, bringing our aggregate savings to over $1 billion since program inception. This performance is slightly ahead of plan as our team's accelerated savings efforts to offset macroeconomic volume headwinds that were greater than expected throughout the year, including during the fourth quarter.Strategic sourcing initiatives remain the largest contributor to our supply chain transformation to date. In addition to the program, freight rate and demerge savings also contributed to margin improvement starting early in 2023 and holding throughout the year. Consistent with expectations set at transformation inception, we expect strategic sourcing to be the leading contributor to savings, and we expect this to be the case in 2024. Our operations excellence program continues to leverage lean manufacturing principles to improve productivity across both business segments. This work stream will expand in scope during 2024 and drive further cost efficiency in our manufacturing base. The footprint-related projects are progressing on schedule and production transfers into centers of excellence are in the various stages of qualification, testing and execution. Similarly, logistics network optimization programs are also on track with regional distribution center redesigns underway. Concerning complexity reduction, our teams have identified approximately 85,000 SKUs for discontinuation and are assisting customers as they transition to replacement products. We have successfully eliminated over 45,000 SKUs as of the end of 2023, with more expected in 2024. These actions are expected to generate approximately $0.5 billion of savings in 2024, supporting the funding of additional growth investments in our core business. As we move into the next phase of our transformation, footprint and product changes such as those from platforming will become more important and result in a lumpier cost savings trajectory as you would expect. We remain confident that our transformation can support the sustainable cost efficiency needed to return our adjusted gross margin to 35% or greater. Moving to the next slide. Two of our primary areas of focus during 2023 were free cash flow generation and gross margin expansion. We reduced inventory by approximately $240 million in the fourth quarter, inclusive of approximately $100 million attributable to the infrastructure business held for sale accounting. This brings our inventory reduction to approximately $1.1 billion in 2023 and $1.9 billion since the middle of 2022. Our disciplined inventory reduction efforts throughout the year supported $853 million of free cash flow generation, which we used to fund our dividend and reduce debt by approximately $280 million versus the prior year. We remain focused on working capital optimization in addition to improving profitability to generate significant free cash flow. In 2024, we plan to reduce inventory by $400 million to $500 million as we continue to prioritize working capital efficiency. CapEx is expected to range between $400 million to $500 million, increasing versus 2023 predominantly in support of the footprint-related transformation initiatives planned for 2024. These items, in combination with organic cash generation, underpin our full year free cash flow range of $600 million to $800 million. As a reminder, we expect a typical profile for our working capital as we build inventory for the 2024 Tools & Outdoor spring selling season, resulting in the typical first quarter operating cash outflow. Our priority for capital deployment remains consistent, making transformation investments, funding our long-standing commitment to return value to shareholders through cash dividends and further strengthening our balance sheet. Turning to profitability. Adjusted gross margin of 29.8% in the fourth quarter was up 10.3 points versus the prior year, driven by lower inventory destocking costs, supply chain transformation benefits and lower shipping costs, which more than offset the impact from lower volume. Adjusted gross margin finished ahead of plan as we intentionally accelerated supply chain transformation actions in 2023 while navigating weak consumer and outdoor demand and channel inventory conservatism to meet our profitability and cash flow objectives. Additionally, pricing was 0.5 point better than our expectation due to lower promotional mix in the quarter. We will continue our measured and disciplined approach to cost management to moderately improve on our second half 2023 adjusted gross margin gains into the first half of 2024, while managing the margin pressures that accompany the outdoor selling season. This is notable given that we were able to deliver second half 2023 adjusted gross margin 1 point above the high end of our initial '23 guidance, demonstrating that transformation is on our targeted trajectory. We are planning for adjusted gross margin to approximate 30% for the full year 2024 and expect to exit the year in the low 30s, consistent with prior expectations. We are leveraging our $0.5 billion of cost reductions from the supply chain transformation and working hard to navigate another year without a macroeconomic tailwind. We made significant progress throughout 2023 on our journey to restore our historical 35% plus adjusted gross margin, and our efforts are enabling incremental investments to accelerate long-term organic revenue growth. Now let's turn to our 2024 guidance and the remaining key assumptions. To reiterate, we are planning for 2024 to be another year where we prioritize cash flow generation and gross margin improvement. We are initiating a full year free cash flow guidance range of $600 million to $800 million, GAAP earnings per share range of $1.60 to $2.85 and an adjusted earnings per share range of $3.50 to $4.50. We expect relative strength in demand for professional tools in some of our industrial markets. Conversely, we are prepared for weak consumer and outdoor demand trends to persist. Together, these dynamics result in a modestly negative outlook in aggregate for our markets. We are planning for organic revenue to be relatively flat at the midpoint, supported by targeted share gains in our businesses. Our EPS range contemplates plus or minus 2 points of volume growth, with the variation representing the market demand scenarios in the plan. Tools & Outdoor organic revenue is expected to be relatively flat at the midpoint, behind our focus to win with the pro through industry-leading innovation, investments in field resources and consumer share gains, leveraging our strong portfolio of brands. The Industrial segment revenue is expected to be relatively flat to slightly positive organically, primarily driven by aerospace market recovery as well as leveraging our core business model and electrification to deliver share gains. Industrial growth in 2024 is expected to be moderated by infrastructure destocking in Q1 before the closure of the signed divestiture and expected softness in general industrial fastening markets. We will continue to invest for long-term organic growth and share gain throughout 2024 and plan to invest an incremental $100 million to accelerate innovation, market activation and to support our powerful DEWALT, CRAFTSMAN and STANLEY brands. Our planning expectation is that SG&A as a percentage of sales in 2024 remains consistent with our recent fourth quarter around 21%, which includes investments. Turning to profitability. We expect total company adjusted EBITDA margin to improve to approximately 10% for the full year, supported by the benefits of the transformation program. Segment margin in Tools & Outdoor is planned to be up year-over-year, also driven by continued momentum from our ongoing strategic transformation. The Industrial segment margin is expected to be flat to up slightly versus prior year as operating improvement in Engineered Fastening is offset by the dilution from the previously announced divestiture of the Infrastructure business. For additional context around Infrastructure, our guidance assumes approximately $100 million of first quarter sales with the divestiture closing at the end of the quarter, thereafter, we have excluded the profit and assume the proceeds will be used to reduce our commercial paper debt balance. With these assumptions, we've established a $1 adjusted EPS range, with the largest contributor being market demand variability. We will work to optimize adjusted gross margin through our transformation program. We will manage SG&A thoughtfully throughout the year given the macro uncertainty but we will be working hard to preserve investments to position the business for longer-term growth. Turning to the other elements of guidance. GAAP earnings include pretax non-GAAP adjustments ranging from $290 million to $340 million largely related to the supply chain transformation program with approximately 25% of these expenses being noncash footprint rationalization costs. Our adjusted tax rate is expected to step up in 2024 to 10%, with the first 3 quarters generally in the mid-20s. Discrete tax planning items are expected to reduce the full year rate and we currently expect these to occur in the fourth quarter. Other 2024 guidance assumptions at the midpoint are noted on the slide to assist with modeling. We expect the first quarter adjusted earnings per share to be approximately 13% of the full year at the midpoint. The EPS for the first quarter is impacted by the tax profile I discussed earlier and a heavier contribution from interest expense associated with the expected first quarter commercial paper debt balance. Adjusted first quarter EBITDA as a percentage of the full year is expected to be over 20%, consistent with pre-pandemic history. First quarter total company organic sales growth is expected to be down low single digits, primarily due to the same factors driving fourth quarter '23 softness. Adjusted EBITDA margins are planned to be up strongly versus prior year, leveraging the carryover benefits of the program and comping the destocking period.In summary, 2024 represents another step along our transformation journey with a continued focus on gross margin and cash while targeting share gains in a stable but tough macro environment. We believe our actions continue to position the company for long-term growth and shareholder return. With that, I will now pass the call back to Don."", 'Donald Allan', ""Thank you, Pat. We embarked on a bold transformation in the middle of 2022 to set Stanley Black & Decker on a path to drive strong long-term shareholder returns through sustainable growth, profitability and cash flow improvements. As we report another quarter of progress, our consistent execution against our plan gives us the confidence to increase investments, supporting the acceleration of organic growth behind our most powerful brands, particularly DEWALT, CRAFTSMAN and STANLEY.In the face of dynamic markets, we're focused on delivering best-in-class product innovation, implementing cost efficiency measures within our control and driving share gain in our core markets. I am confident that we are creating a stronger and more focused company capable of gaining market share consistently over the long term with the best people, the most iconic brands and the highest quality innovation engine in the industry. With that, we are now ready for Q&A, Dennis."", 'Dennis M. Lange', 'Great. Thanks, Don. Shannon, we can now start the Q&A, please. Thank you.', 'Operator', '(Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from the line of Julian Mitchell with Barclays.', 'Julian C.H. Mitchell', ""Maybe just a question for me around that rate of improvement as we're going through the year. Just trying to understand, I guess, particularly the gross margin delta and also on the free cash flow progression. What's the confidence that, that gross margin can sort of move up sequentially as you go through the year to get to that low 30s exit rate? And on free cash, kind of how weighted should that $700 million midpoint be to the second half?"", 'Patrick D. Hallinan', ""Julian, it's Pat. Thanks for the questions. Our focus next year is on both of these topics, gross margin and cash delivery. And as we moved through '23 and made very strong progress on gross margin, we certainly had the benefit in '23 of that progression being the consumption of high-cost inventory out of the balance sheet. So throughout '23 you saw a very, very significant degree of progression throughout the year. Throughout '24, we're confident in our plan, and we're targeting the 300 basis points roughly of progression throughout the year. It will be back half weighted. And part of that is the low volumes that we saw the back half of '23 and expect to see the front half of '24, but we have every confidence we're going to deliver it. And as we started talking to investors in the back half of last year, we guided people to measure our gross margin progress in half year increments. And if you look at the back half of '23, we were about 28.7% for our back half of '23 progression. And we expect to be in expansion mode, the front half of '24. It will be modest in the 50-ish basis point range. And we'll be stepping up more significantly in the back half of '24 as we accelerate some of the savings efforts we have on the docket for the year quickly to offset some of the volume softness we've been experiencing in the last 6 to 12 months. But we have every confidence we're going to get there. In terms of cash, the main difference in cash year-over-year is really the difference in the transformation initiatives that are planned for 2024, where we're doing a bigger proportion of the footprint moves, which are going to drive more CapEx during '24 than during '23 about $100 million and more cash-oriented restructuring charges around $50 million. So the big difference year-over-year in cash drivers are the restructuring agenda. If you look at the rest of the cash drivers, we're still targeting pretty meaningful inventory reduction, but less than the $1 billion that we drove off the balance sheet in '23. We're going to be in the $400 million to $500 million range. But that difference in inventory reduction is made up by a higher operating profit. So those two things roughly offset each other, and the drivers are really the difference in year-over-year CapEx and the difference in year-over-year cash restructuring targets."", 'Operator', 'Our next question comes from the line of Tim Wojs with Baird.', 'Timothy Ronald Wojs', ""Nice job with the margins. Maybe just -- I had 2 cost questions. So first, just on investments, Pat. What are you kind of explicitly investing or at least what's planned to be invested in '24? And how variable are you kind of planning to manage those investments as you go through the year? And then secondly, just on cost inflation, could you give us just an idea of kind of what you're seeing and kind of key cost inputs? And then also, what's kind of explicitly baked into price cost?"", 'Patrick D. Hallinan', ""Yes. So on investments, we're continuing to invest predominantly in innovation and then in the field and marketing resources to activate it. So of the $100 million we're targeting for '24, I'd say 3 quarters or more are around that. Obviously, a lot of that in our biggest business, our tools and outdoor business, but some in industrial as well, so mostly about innovation and market activation and field resources to support it. Maybe 20% to 25% is another capability building to make us a more productive organization. And then as we go through the year, I mean, obviously, we're going into a year with a pretty muted macro and the uncertainty we've been experiencing in the last 12 or 18 months, we're certainly going to be paying close attention to the macro and managing our cost structure as we go throughout the year to be in step with that macro. But we are really focused on the long-term growth of this business, and we're going to be working hard as a leadership team and as an organization to preserve those investments even if the macro creates a bit more headwinds than we're expecting. Because we're not going to just completely collapse '24 investment at the risk of longer-term brand health and brand share gaining power. In terms of inflation and deflation for the year, our plan expects roughly flat across kind of materials and freight. You've obviously had some of the battery metals go down in significant percentage terms. But in dollar terms, those don't drive our basket as much as some others. There's been some recent upticks in steel, resins, and we'll probably face some marginal pressure from Red Sea freight. But overall, you put metals and freight together roughly flat, still kind of a high labor rate environment, but that's embedded in our gross margin and SG&A assumptions. And then finally, price cost, again, roughly neutral. We'll have some carry-in price in Industrial, that's to the good, offset by just the normalization of promotional cadence in Tools & Outdoor. Again, recall the back half of '23, we're getting back to a normal promotional cadence as our supply chain healed, and that will be playing through the front half of '24 as well. But I'd say those 2 forces together, enterprise-wide get us to roughly flat price dynamics for the year. And again, roughly flat inflation backdrop in total."", 'Operator', 'Our next question comes from the line of Chris Snyder with UBS.', 'Christopher M. Snyder', ""I just wanted to follow up about the flat lining of gross margin that's expected into the first half relative to the Q4 exit rate. It seems like there is a lot of savings on the balance sheet that is yet to flow through the P&L. And I think the expectation is that those come through on a couple quarter lag. So just maybe why is that not coming through in the first half?And I understand the outdoor mix will pick up. But I would also think that Tools gross margin gets better from Q4 into the first half as you move past the holiday promo. So any color on the gross margin delta between those product lines to help understand that mix would be helpful."", 'Patrick D. Hallinan', ""Yes, yes, no. Like I said, we do expect some modest expansion front half to front half. We had, as we went through '23, and we saw volumes being really soft, I think, commend the team for still delivering over $500 million of savings across the volume backdrop that was for the year, about 300 or 400 basis points below what we expected. And we got beyond the high side of our guidance for '23 gross margins. So we came out at quite a strong rate. As you point out, the trajectory in the first half is positive even if a bit muted. And I'd say the couple of forces of that are one that you pointed to, you have a heavier outdoor mix in the first half of the year. And you have some of the under absorption that you -- that was associated with low volumes from the back half of '23. And those are really the two forces, and they play out in the front half by muting some of the rate of that progress, but they don't take us off track for the full year savings."", 'Operator', 'Our next question comes from the line of Rob Wertheimer with Melius Research.', 'Robert Cameron Wertheimer', ""My question is on dynamics at the retail channel. And if I understood it right, you had volumes a little soft. You had promotional activity down, which is good. And I'm just curious about how that works out in market share, whether the competition is stepping up promotional activity, whether channel inventory is not normalized, there is less promotion. Maybe just give us a comment on market share, on promotions, on dynamics of retail."", 'Donald Allan', ""Sure. Thanks, Rob. I think the competitive landscape has not really shifted or changed as we went through the end of '23 into the early stages of '24. There's modest movements in certain brands moving across retailers. But aside from that, we're not seeing unusual pricing or discounting happening. And for the most part, it's really all of us navigating a somewhat muted market right now and beginning -- continuing to position ourselves for share gain. But I'll ask Chris Nelson to give a little more color on what are we seeing."", 'Christopher John Nelson', ""Yes. I'd say that if you think about the -- just referencing POS, I would say that the POS played out roughly as we would have planned it in Q4, where we saw it was down year-over-year, but above 2019 levels. And if you think about the kind of buckets they're in, we saw strength out of the pro and the expected level of kind of difficulties that we are going to see in the consumer in DIY segment. So that's on plan, and it's what we're contemplating, as we said, moving into this year for that being a fairly stable macro that we're playing the backdrop against. As Don referenced, we're not seeing major changes in the competitive dynamics. What we are seeing and we're excited about is getting back to our normal promotional rhythms as we have been able to take care of our customers and fill our -- our fill rates have been proven. And that's made a big difference in our opportunity to compete well in retail. And then I think the final part of your question that you referenced was regarding inventory levels. And certainly, on a global basis, as people take a look at what is somewhat of a dynamic or a tepid macro, people are thinking about rightsizing their inventories for that environment. And we see that in somewhat anecdotally in places like Europe and some of our professional channels. But when you take a look at the biggest chunks of the inventory where we have really clean data in our major retailers, we're at historical levels. We feel good where we are their positioned, and we think that, that's going to be kind of a neutral dynamic heading into 2024."", 'Operator', 'Our next question comes from the line of Nigel Coe with Wolfe Research.', 'Nigel Edward Coe', ""Believe it or not, it was actually at World Concrete. I saw the new products. Pretty impressive, I would say, so congrats on that launch. Just on the pricing, came in obviously, better than last quarter in Tools & Outdoor. So just wondering if -- you talked about normalization of the promotional activity. And I'm just wondering if maybe you pulled back in the fourth quarter and perhaps that kind of put some of the -- maybe the weakness in Tools & Outdoor. But just, I'd really be curious on the footprint changes you're making with the CapEx. Obviously, we've got Trump talking about China tariffs. I'm just wondering if there's going to be a material change in your sourcing and footprint during 2024."", 'Donald Allan', ""Yes. So Nigel, I'll have Chris answer your first question, and then I'll take the second question after you're done."", 'Christopher John Nelson', ""So from a pricing perspective, Nigel, good to hear from you. I'm glad you were able to see the new products. Sorry, I missed you there. But no, we did not see a significant pullback in the promotional volume. What we saw was an overall, as we saw -- as we said, more challenge in the overall macro environment that I think contributed to that more than anything. And as we transition into next year, we're expecting that pricing dynamic to stay fairly stable. We feel good about our plans there. And overall, I think it's fair to say that, as Pat pointed out, we're at a -- we're kind of at a neutral price cost. We're not banking on a bunch of inflation. And as we take a look at the rearview mirror, we have recouped a significant, but not all of the costs that we took on as we saw inflation. And so keeping that neutral price cost is important for our gross margin trajectory moving forward as well."", 'Donald Allan', ""Yes. The comment on the footprint, I mean, yes, the geopolitical dynamics continue to be intriguing and interesting for sure, what may play out in the future. But as it comes to our footprint transformation, we started with an overarching strategy of finding ways to get closer to our customer with our supply base in our manufacturing operations is certain types of products that are high volume in particular. Other products, you have to focus more on the low-cost location. And so you end up with a mix geography of where you're manufacturing and how you're serving your customers. That hasn't really changed. What we continue to do as part of the transformation, though, is develop centers of excellence for power tools, certain types of hand tools, certain types of outdoor products that leverage the expertise we have in these geographies in Asia, in Mexico and in the United States and Eastern Europe. We will continue to build upon that, which gives -- eventually will give us the ability to flex supply from different geographies if the geopolitical landscape changes radically. That will take time to do. That's not something that will necessarily occur in the next 6 to 12 months. But as we continue on this journey and finish this transformation in the next 2 to 3 years, that's an outcome that we're looking to achieve. And so we believe that's the appropriate way to address what's happening in the dynamic geopolitical space and we'll continue to evaluate that going forward as things shift in countries like the United States if they shift and make pivots as necessary."", 'Operator', 'Our next question comes from the line of Adam Baumgarten with Zelman & Associates.', 'Adam Michael Baumgarten', ""Just on SKU rationalization, do you think that had any impact on the volumes in the fourth quarter or even the second half of '23?"", 'Christopher John Nelson', 'Go ahead, Pat.', 'Patrick D. Hallinan', ""Yes, Adam, no. I mean that program has been very thoughtful in weeding out of complexity that's not creating value for end users or for our shareholders. And there's no major disruption by that, by any stretch of the imagination..."", 'Operator', 'Our next question comes from the line of Michael Rehaut with JPMorgan.', 'Michael Jason Rehaut', ""I had a question on the growth investments and just how to think about the cadence of that longer term. I think you talked about it a little bit earlier in the call. But when you talk about in totality, I think alongside the 35% plus gross margin and enabling $300 million to $500 million of growth investments, I was hoping just to get a sense of what those investments were in '23, what you expect them to be in '24 and '25. And how much of that is going to be kind of an ongoing level of investment and if that would all be on the income statement in the Tools & Storage or if there would be some in corporate?"", 'Patrick D. Hallinan', ""Yes, Mike, I'll give you a few points. I'd say '23 was a bit over $100 million, will be around $100 million for '24. And as I referenced on an earlier question, it's about 3/4 around innovation and then the marketing and field resources to activate that effectively. And the rest of it is around capability building, some of it in our business segments, a relatively small amount of it in corporate. And I think if you're getting to the broader question of you're sitting there with a model and you're trying to figure out is SG&A permanently at 21% of sales or something else, if that's kind of behind the essence of your question, I'd say as we get back to share gains and as we jolt our brands and our innovation up for a few years, I expect in the medium term to be more in the back to the 20-ish percent range, if that's kind of what you're trying to unpack. But I would expect us to be elevated in '24 and potentially in '25 and in '26 depending on the macro and some of the things we're prioritizing in the medium term around that 20-ish percent level. And then I think beyond the medium term, to the extent we can be exceptional at driving gross margin improvement, the SG&A will move with the rate at which we can drive gross margin improvement."", 'Operator', 'Our next question comes from the line of Eric Bosshard with Cleveland Research.', 'Eric Bosshard', ""The -- you talked about normalizing promotions and you talked about I think volumes relative to '19. Just curious if you could give us a little bit of insight into promotional activity relative to '19, where we are now and what is embedded in the guidance and what you're seeing in the market in regards to an appetite for promotions either from consumers, professionals or retailers."", 'Donald Allan', ""Yes, Eric. So I would say that the level of promotional activities we're at now and we would expect in '24 is probably pretty consistent with what we experienced in 2019. And so we're kind of back to where we were, which I think was a healthy balance of normal core operating selling activities and promotional activities. As we think about the year, our customers are not really talking to us about what I would call unusual levels of promotional activities. They're looking for the normal set of activities. And I think that's going to likely be the case throughout the year. And we tend to -- in demand markets like this that are somewhat stable in the sense where you don't have a lot of growth and you don't have a lot of retraction, it tends to be a more normal promotional environment in that setting. If demand retracts in a more significant way, then promotional activity does pull back a fair amount because the impact of promotions is not as significant. If we see a back half of the year that gets better, which there's -- we talked about that in our presentation that -- our guidance doesn't necessarily include that. But if the back half demand environment is in an improved environment, then you could potentially see a little bit of tick up in promotional activity related to that. But at this stage, based on our guidance, I think it's probably balanced to say that our view is that promotional activity will be consistent with what we saw pre-pandemic."", 'Operator', 'Thank you. This concludes the question-and-answer session. I would now like to hand the conference back over to Dennis Lange for closing remarks.', 'Dennis M. Lange', ""Shannon, thanks.

Of course, the most consequential for investors will be the U.S. elections, which could heighten market volatility. Additionally, the uncertain outcome of the current geopolitical turmoil and monetary policy direction raises the stakes even further.', 'As we navigate the complexities of the current economic environment, dividend stocks should be a cornerstone of your portfolio. They not only withstand market volatilities but also provide a steady income stream. Remember, the allure of dividend stocks lies not just in the immediate cash flow but also in their potential for long-term capital appreciation.', 'InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips', 'In this context, we explore three compelling dividend stocks for long-term income.

This pipeline network carries natural gas liquids and various crude oil varieties from the Canadian oil sands to refinery hubs in eastern Canada, the U.S. Midwest, and the U.S. Gulf Coast. Most Canadian oil producers use the pipeline to access multiple markets across the U.S.', 'Typically, the Mainline system has a utilization rate above 90%.

Other key assets include five intra-Alberta long-haul pipelines and several Gulf Coast and Mid-Continent pipelines like the Seaway Pipeline between Cushing, OK and Freeport, TX.', 'These diverse pipeline assets are a source of reliable income for Enbridge.

Robinson Worldwide, Inc. isn’t one of the 30 most popular stocks among hedge funds at the end of the third quarter (see the details here).', ""Operator: Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the C.H. Robinson Fourth Quarter 2023 Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Following the company's prepared remarks, we will open the line for a live question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded, Wednesday, January 31st, 2024. I would now like to turn the conference over to Chuck Ives, Director of Investor Relations."", 'Chuck Ives: Thank you, Donna, and good afternoon, everyone. On the call with me today is Dave Bozeman, our President and Chief Executive Officer; Arun Rajan, our Chief Operating Officer; and Mike Zechmeister, our Chief Financial Officer. Dave and Mike will provide a summary of our fourth quarter results and our expense guidance for 2024. Arun will provide an update on our initiatives to improve the customer and carrier experience, improve operating leverage and increased focus on revenue management. And Dave will share the findings from his initial diagnosis of the company. From there, we will open the call up for questions. Our earnings presentation slides are supplemental to our earnings release and can be found in the Investors section of our website at investor.chrobinson.com.', ""Our prepared comments are not intended to follow the slides. If we do refer to specific information on the slides, we will let you know which slide we're referencing. Today's remarks also contain certain non-GAAP measures and reconciliations of those measures to GAAP measures are included in the presentation. I'd also like to remind you that our remarks today may contain forward-looking statements. Slide 2 in today's presentation lists factors that could cause our actual results to differ from management's expectations. And with that, I'll turn the call over to Dave."", 'Dave Bozeman: Thank you, Chuck. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. Our fourth quarter results did not meet our expectations as we continue to battle through a poor demand and pricing environment. But we made progress on a number of important initiatives, including charting our path forward. But let me address our results first. On our third quarter earnings call, we indicated the Q4 truck volumes in NAST could follow the normal seasonal pattern. And in fact, that is what occurred. Specifically, the average sequential Q4 decline in the Cass Freight Shipment Index over the past 10 years is 2.4%. Excluding the pandemic-impacted years of 2020 and 2021, the average sequential Q4 decline was 3.7%. In Q4 of 2023, the shipment index declined 4.3% sequentially and our combined truckload and LTL shipments declined less than the index at 3.5%.', ""In Global Forwarding, we increased our ocean shipments on a year-over-year basis, but they were down sequentially as well, as they typically are in a fourth quarter. For the enterprise in total, the sequential declines in volume drove a 3% sequential decline in our Q4 AGP versus Q3. And this equated to $0.11 of our sequential EPS decline. Below gross profit, personnel and SG&A expenses were within the guidance ranges that we provided on our Q3 earnings call. Although personnel expenses were toward the high end of our guidance range. Sequentially, Q4 personnel expenses increased due to the reduction of our incentive compensation accruals in Q3 that we didn't expect to repeat in Q4, as was explained on our Q3 earnings call. SG&A expenses were down sequentially but slightly above the midpoint of our guidance."", ""In total, the 3.7% sequential increase in our operating expenses equated to $0.13 of sequential EPS decline. The combination of all these changes in AGP and operating expenses, some of which were expected, drove the sequential decrease in operating income. Below operating income, there were a couple of significant items that negatively impacted our financial results and ultimately drove the remaining $0.10 of sequential decline in our adjusted EPS, namely non-cash losses on foreign currency revaluation and a higher income tax rate. Later in the call, Mike will share more details on these as well as provide guidance on our 2024 operating expenses. So that addresses why our Q4 results declined sequentially versus Q3. Now, I'll provide some additional details on our Q4 results in our North American Surface Transportation and Global Forwarding businesses."", 'In our NAST truckload business, our Q4 volume declined approximately 1.5% year-over-year and 3.5% on a sequential basis. The weak demand environment in an elongated market trough combined with excess carrier capacity continued to result in a very competitive market. With the exception of the holiday weeks in Q4, the dry van load-to-truck ratio was around 2:1. And in the second half of the quarter, was the lowest the industry has seen in the past six years. With this environment at play in Q4, we targeted more truckload volume in the spot market, where we could capture more profit due to seasonal market tension. This led to a sequential improvement in our overall truckload AGP per load in October and November and for the quarter as a whole. Profit per load in December declined as expected as the cost of purchased transportation moves seasonally higher.', ""For the quarter, we had an approximate mix of 65% contractual volume and 35% transactional volume in our truckload business compared to a 70/30 mix over the past three quarters. The sequential declines that we've seen in our truckload line haul cost per mile since Q2 of 2022 continued through November of 2023, before moving seasonally higher in December. On a year-over-year basis, we saw a decline of approximately 10.5% in our average Q4 truckload line haul cost per mile paid to carriers, excluding fuel surcharges. Due to the usual time lag associated with the resetting of contract pricing to follow spot market cost, our average truckload line haul rate or price built to our customers excluding fuel surcharges declined 13.5% on a year-over-year basis."", 'With this price decline coming off a higher base than the costs, these changes resulted in a 29.5% year-over-year decrease in AGP per load. Moving into 2024, we will substantially increase our focus on revenue management objectives to better align revenue and cost in our contractual portfolio. Arun will share more on this in a little bit, but we intend to use our advanced pricing and contract management tools in a more surgical and disciplined approach as we navigate changing market conditions in the future with a focus on profitable growth. In our LTL business, Q4 shipments were down 0.5% on a year-over-year basis, and 3.5% sequentially. AGP per order declined 8.5% on a year-over-year basis, driven primarily by the soft market conditions and lower fuel prices.', 'On a sequential basis, the cost and price of purchased transportation in the LTL market increased in Q4, primarily driven by the assets and capacity that have temporarily exited the LTL market. This resulted in a 3% sequential increase in AGP per order. In our Global Forwarding business, results continued to be impacted by the imbalance of soft demand and ample capacity. In Q4, our ocean forwarding AGP declined by 17.2% year-over-year, driven by a 20.5% decrease in AGP per shipment that was partially offset by a 4% increase in shipments. Compared to pre-pandemic levels, we have grown ocean market share by providing differentiated solutions and customer service and by leveraging investments in technology and talent, leading to the addition of new customers and diversification of the verticals and trade lanes that we serve.', ""In the wake of the ongoing conflict in the Red Sea and low water levels in the Panama Canal, global supply chains are facing transit interruptions and vessel rerouting which is causing extended transit times and putting a strain on global ocean capacity. While the Asia to Europe trade lane has been most affected, the impact is extending to other lanes as carriers adjust routes based on shipping demand. As a result, ocean rates have increased sharply in Q1 on several trade lanes, including Asia to Europe and Asia to North America. While the Red Sea disruption continues without any clear timeline of when it will be resolved, the strain on capacity and the elevated spot rates are expected to continue through at least the Chinese New Year. As a global logistics provider with the scale and expertise to strategize and implement contingency plans, we're highly engaged with our customers to help them navigate the evolving situation and ensure flexibility and resilience in their supply chain."", 'At some point, we expect that ocean pricing will loosen as new vessel capacity continues to enter the market in 2024. Looking ahead, we do not see any indications of a global freight volume upturn in the immediate future. In NAST, similar to the fourth quarter, the first quarter is typically characterized by a sequential decrease in ground transportation volumes. In fact, the average sequential Q1 decline in the Cass Freight Shipment Index over the past 10 years was 2.6%. As the global freight market fluctuates due to seasonal, cyclical, and geopolitical factors, we remain focused on what we can control by providing superior service to our customers and carriers, streamlining our processes by removing waste and manual touches, and delivering tools that enable our customer and carrier-facing employees to allocate their time to relationship building, value-added solutioning, and exception management.', ""Our 17% improvement in NAST shipments per person per day in Q4, exceeded our stated 15% target and is an indicator of the progress that we've made on removing waste and manual touches. These efforts are also bearing fruit in other key areas of our business as Global Forwarding achieved a 20% year-over-year improvement in their Q4 shipments per person per month. Our continued focus on productivity improvement is one part of our plan to address and optimize our enterprise-wide structural cost. And we expect to carry our productivity momentum into 2024. Our commitment to deliver quality and continuous improvement to our customers continues to be validated by net promoter scores in 2023 that were the highest on record for the company, which we believe puts us in good position with customers ahead of the eventual rebound in the freight market."", 'Our customers continue to value the quality, stability and reliability that we provide as they work to optimize their transportation needs. They want a partner who has financial strength and the ability to invest through cycles in the customer experience. They also want a partner who can meet their increasingly complex logistics needs by providing expertise and a breadth of innovative solutions enabled by technology and people that they can rely on to serve as an extension of their team. C.H. Robinson is that partner, with a combination of people, technology, and scale to deliver an unmatched customer experience, and with the breadth of capabilities to meet all their logistic needs, including value-added solutions for cross-border freight, drop trailer capacity, and retail consolidation.', ""As we continue to improve the customer experience and our cost-to-serve, I'm focused on ensuring that we'll be ready for the eventual freight market rebound, with a durable cost structure that decouples volume growth from headcount growth and drives operating leverage. In order to further eliminate productivity bottlenecks in the highest leverage areas, we're focused on a handful of concurrent workstreams that will deliver an improved customer experience through process optimization. These focused workstreams are an example of how the leadership team and I have made changes to drive focus so that we position ourselves for growth in our core business. Our commitment to continuously improving the experience of our customers and carriers and eliminating inefficiencies from our processes will make us a company that is faster, more flexible, and more agile in solving problems for our customers, delivering better customer service, and creating operating leverage and profitable growth."", ""I'll turn it over to Arun now to provide more details on our efforts to strengthen our customer and carrier experience, and our revenue management practices and improve our efficiency and operating leverage."", ""Arun Rajan: Thanks, Dave, and good afternoon, everyone. As Dave said, we continue to execute on a handful of concurrent workstreams that are addressing significant opportunities to eliminate productivity bottlenecks and to deliver process optimization and an improved customer experience. Two of the workstreams on the productivity roadmap are aimed at quoting and order entry. In both areas, we are reducing manual touches and our response time to customers driving faster speed-to-market and higher customer engagement. In addition to our past learnings, we're leaning more heavily on Generative AI to deliver process improvements. In our order entry workstream, we're utilizing GenAI to translate structured and unstructured emails, PDFs, and Excel files that we receive from customers and their vendors into orders on our system."", ""This solution fills in customer-specific requirements based on their past history and customer-specific prompts and scenarios entered by frontline teams who know the customers' business. GenAI puts the power of large language models into the hands of our front-line teams, rather than relying solely on data scientists to train models for unique customer requirements. While our preference is still to receive an order via API or other structured electronic means, there's large variability in how customer orders are transmitted. And this new method allows customers to have an interaction as though we receive their order via structured electronic means even when they choose to email an order to us. With more data and history to leverage than any other 3PL, we have opportunities to harness the power that Generative AI now offers to further capitalize on our information advantage, and we'll continue to look for and pursue those opportunities."", ""Another area where we've advanced our capabilities is in touchless appointments where we've introduced technology to automate the entire process. This technology also uses AI to determine the optimal appointment based on transit time data from our millions of shipments across 300,000 shipping lanes, facility data such as peak dwell time and the most convenient time windows for carriers. This advancement saves shippers a considerable amount of time, enables them to achieve higher service levels and saves them money by avoiding chargebacks or fines they might face due to freight arriving too early or too late. In addition to an improved customer experience, our efforts are increasing the digital execution of critical touch points in the lifecycle of an order from quote to cash, thereby reducing the number of manual tasks per shipment and the time per task."", ""This translates to productivity improvements, measured in terms of shipments per person per day, which creates operating leverage. As Dave mentioned earlier, we surpassed our 2023 goal of a 15% year-over-year improvement in NAST shipments per person per day with 17% improvement achieved in Q4. As we deliver further process optimization and an improved customer experience, we plan to deliver the compounded cost structure benefits of additional 2024 productivity improvements of 15% NAST and 10% in Global Forwarding with technology that supports our people and processes. As Dave also mentioned, revenue management is a key focus for us as we navigate this difficult freight market. With continued investment in our pricing science and contract management technology over the course of 2023, we're now in a better position to respond to dynamic market conditions with the tools and capabilities we've developed."", ""In 2024, we will increase our rigor and disciplines of the application of these tools and capabilities. These tools, together with our scale, data and customer and carrier relationships underpin our revenue management function through which we can be more surgical in how we approach customer discussions and how we implement a disciplined pricing and profitable growth strategy based on individual customer value propositions. With that, I'll turn the call over to Mike for a review of our fourth quarter results."", 'Mike Zechmeister: Thanks, Arun, and good afternoon, everyone. The soft freight market outlined by Dave resulted in fourth quarter total revenues of $4.2 billion and adjusted gross profit or AGP of $618.6 million which was down 20% year-over-year, driven by a 24% decline in NAST and a 14% decline in Global Forwarding. On a monthly basis compared to Q4 of 2022, our total company AGP per business day was down 24% in October, down 20% in November, and down 13% in December. Turning to expenses, Q4 personnel expenses were $361.8 million, including a $1.3 million favorable restructuring charge adjustment, primarily driven by the significant devaluation of the Argentine peso prior to completing the divestiture of our Global Forwarding operations in Argentina.', 'Excluding these reversals, our Q4 personnel expenses of $363.2 million were down 10.5% year-over-year, primarily due to our cost optimization efforts and lower variable compensation. Our average Q4 headcount was down 13.3% year-over-year, including double-digit decreases in NAST, Global Forwarding, and our All Other and Corporate segments. Ending headcount was down 12.4% year-over-year to 15,246. As Dave mentioned, the sequential increase in our Q4 personnel expenses was included in our guidance. Although Q4 personnel expenses were within our guidance range, they came in at the higher-end due to the achievement of certain objective bonus targets, for example, delivering results on cost-reduction initiatives. Moving to SG&A. Q4 expenses were $149.4 million, including a $2.9 million reversal of restructuring charges, also driven by the peso deflation prior to completing the divestiture of our Global Forwarding operations in Argentina.', 'Excluding the reversal, SG&A expenses were $152.3 million, a decline of 5.8% year-over-year, primarily due to reductions in contingent worker expenses, and were down 2.6% sequentially. As you recall from our Q1 earnings call in April, we raised our cost-savings commitment to $300 million from $150 million which was defined as the net annualized cost savings by Q4 of 2023, compared to the annualized run rate of Q3 of 2022 which is when a commitment was originally made. With the progress on our 2023 productivity initiatives, we delivered $346 million in cost savings for the full year excluding restructuring charges with the majority of these savings expected to be long-term structural changes. Consistent with our strategy, we believe these cost savings will improve our operating leverage and help our margins as demand and a more balanced freight market return.', 'Turning to our 2024 annual operating expense guidance. We expect our personnel expenses to be $1.4 billion to $1.5 billion. At the midpoint, this is up 0.2% compared to our 2023 total of $1.447 billion excluding restructuring charges. The personnel expense drivers in 2024 include two items that are expected to offset each other, the restoration of target incentive compensation related to the expected improvement in financial performance will be offset by continued productivity improvements across the business, and lower headcount as the team continues to decouple volume growth and headcount growth. 2024 SG&A expenses are expected to be in the range of $575 million to $625 million, down 0.8% at the midpoint, excluding the restructuring charges in 2023.', ""This includes 2024 depreciation and amortization expense that is expected to be $90 million to $100 million. Although most of our SG&A expenses are subject to inflation, we expect continued cost reduction efforts to offset the inflationary impact. Shifting to expenses below operating income. Our Q4 interest and other expense totaled $38.1 million, which was down $4.3 million, or 10.1% year-over-year. Q4 included $21.6 million in interest expense, which was down $3.1 million, or 12.6% versus Q4 of 2022, driven by $394 million of debt reduction compared to Q4 of '22. Another factor that drove Q4 other expense was an $18.5 million loss on foreign currency revaluation and realized foreign currency gains and losses, which is compared to a $16.9 million loss in Q4 of 2022."", 'The Q4 loss was driven primarily by weakness in the Argentine peso and euro relative to the US dollar. As a reminder, our FX impacts are predominantly non-cash gains and losses related to intercompany assets and liabilities. On a sequential basis, FX had an unfavorable impact of $18.4 million and included an $8.9 million loss related to the significant devaluation of the Argentine peso prior to exiting the business in late December. As you recall from our third quarter earnings call, operating in Argentina had become challenging due to its strict monetary policies and currency devaluation. The divestiture mitigates our exposure to the deteriorating economic conditions and the increasing political instability in that region. As a part of the divesting of our operations in Argentina, we converted the business to a local independent agent to ensure continued service to our customers with shipments in that region.', 'There were also a couple of large one-time tax-related items that impacted our results in Q4. Our Q4 tax provision of $38.3 million included a tax settlement of $19.2 million and $4.7 million of tax expense related to the Argentina divestiture. In regard to the tax settlement, the company came to an agreement with the I.R.S. Appeals division on a tax position related to tax incentives for domestic investments in the years 2014 through 2017. Although we maintained that our software investments were supportable deductions, we were only offered a partial settlement, factoring in costs of litigation, expert advice, and that other companies who have challenged similar positions have experienced unfavorable results. We decided it was in our best interest to settle the issue.', 'The company has no ongoing financial exposure relating to this specific deduction as it was eliminated from the tax code beginning in 2018. Excluding these one-time tax expenses, our effective tax rate came in at 19.5% for the quarter and 15.0% for the year, compared to 19.3% in 2022. Our lower tax rate in 2023 was primarily driven by our -- by lower pretax income and incremental benefits from foreign tax credits. We expect our 2024 full year effective tax rate to be in the range of 17% to 19%. Q4 adjusted or non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.50 excludes $23.9 million of one-time tax expenses, $8.9 million of foreign currency losses on divested Argentina operations, and the $4.3 million reversal of restructuring charges. Turning to cash flow.', ""Q4 cash flow generated by operations was $47 million, compared to $773 million in Q4 of 2022. The year-over-year decline in cash flow was primarily driven by changes in net operating working capital. In Q4 of 2022, we had a $650 million sequential decrease in net operating working capital, driven by the sharply declining costs and price of purchased transportation. In Q4 of 2023, we had a $7 million sequential increase in net operating working capital. In Q4, our capital expenditures were $16.1 million compared to $27.8 million in Q4 of 2022. We expect 2024 capital expenditures to be $85 million to $95 million. We've returned $74 million of cash to shareholders in Q4, which was down 85% year-over-year, primarily due to the decline in cash from operations."", 'Now onto the balance sheet. We ended Q4 with approximately $1.0 billion of liquidity comprised of $840 million of committed funding under our credit facilities and a cash balance of $146 million. Our debt balance at the end of Q4 was $1.6 billion, which was down $394 million since the end of 2022. Our net debt to EBITDA leverage at the end of Q4 was 2.34 times, up from 2.10 times at the end of Q3, driven by the lower EBITDA. Our capital allocation strategy is grounded in maintaining an investment grade credit rating, which allows us to optimize our weighted average cost of capital. Our $619 million in debt paydown since Q3 of 2022 has helped maintain our strong liquidity position and investment grade credit rating. Keep in mind that the cash that we use to reduce debt generally reduced the amount of cash for share repurchases.', ""Overall, I'm encouraged by the much needed progress that was made on our 2023 productivity initiatives and the plans in place to build on that progress in 2024. With the 17% productivity improvement delivered in NAST and the 20% productivity improvement in Global Forwarding in 2023, combined with an expectation of an additional 15% in NAST and 10% in Global Forwarding in 2024, each business is expected to deliver compounded productivity improvements of 32% or better over the two-year period. A robust pipeline of process technology and waste elimination initiatives continues to be acted upon. By leveraging Generative AI combined with machine learning to take the capability of our people to an even higher level, Robinson is positioned well to further reduce waste and drive structural cost changes that improve our operating leverage and help deliver on the long-term operating income margin expectations."", ""With that, I'll turn the call back over to Dave for his final comments."", ""Dave Bozeman: Thanks, Mike. We shared a sentiment of some of our peers in that we're happy to say goodbye to 2023. And although 2024 still presents some of the same challenges and headwinds, I'm excited about the work that we're doing to reinvigorate Robinson's winning culture. Over my first six months here, I completed my initial diagnosis and we're taking actions to chart our path forward. At a high level, we need to focus on both our customer value proposition and revenue generation, and our structural cost, and we need to aggressively seek the optimal balance. Let's review my findings. First, our structural cost base grew too much during the pandemic and we made significant progress on reducing that cost structure in 2023, but it needs to continue to improve."", ""We will do that by embedding lean practices, removing waste and expanding our digital capabilities. This will enable us to strengthen our productivity and optimize our organization structure in order to be the most efficient operator in addition to the highest value provider. Second, as I listen to our customers, it's clear that their logistics needs are becoming increasingly complex and robust capabilities are required to power vertical-centric and value-added solutions. I have found that C.H. Robinson has people with deep expertise in the freight market and long standing trusted relationships with our customers and carriers. This is a competitive advantage, but we can do a better job of leveraging our unique expertise and information advantage and advance our cutting-edge technology to deliver more robust capabilities and market leading outcomes."", ""Third, we need to focus on profitable growth in our four core modes, North American truckload and LTL, and global ocean and air as the engines to ignite growth by reclaiming share in eroded segments and expanding our addressable market through value-added services and solutions that drive new volume to the core modes. And fourth, we need to drive better synergies across our portfolio of services to accelerate profitable growth. One way that we're going to do this is by improving how we go to market as one company with unified account management versus showing up as distinct business units. Our journey to unlock the power of our portfolio is underway as we take action on all of these fronts. One example of this is the recent launching of our Enterprise Strategy Program Management office and the addition of Jim Reutlinger to the senior leadership team to lead our strategic approach to our critical planning activities."", ""Jim is an expert in continuous improvement and lean methodology and he brings learnings from his leadership experience at Danaher, a company with a well-established reputation for continuous improvement. Jim will help us drive lean principles and continuous improvement deeper into the organization and create growth and success in our strategic priorities. I continue to see an opportunity for the company to reach its full potential and create more shareholder value by improving our value proposition, increasing our market share, accelerating growth, further reducing our structural cost, and improving our efficiency, operating margins and profitability. I'm confident that together we will win for our customers, carriers, employees and shareholders, and I'm incredibly excited about our future."", ""This concludes our prepared remarks. I'll turn it back to Donna now for the Q&A portion of the call."", 'See also 10 Highest Quality Egg Brands in the US and 15 Highest Quality Creatine Supplements of 2024.', 'To continue reading the Q&A session, please click here.']"

To that end, the Board recently named two new directors – James Gorman and Jeremy Darroch – both widely respected leaders who will bring fresh perspectives and expertise that complements the talents and experience of the Disney Board as we continue to focus on delivering for shareholders and consumers alike.', 'The Board remains committed to and actively engaged in the high-priority work of succession planning. In particular, we are confident that new Board member Mr. Gorman’s highly successful tenure leading Morgan Stanley through its own business transformation and his stewardship of a very successful multi-year CEO succession process will be hugely additive to the Board’s efforts in this area. To that end, he was appointed to the Board’s Succession Planning Committee, which remains committed to CEO succession planning and achieving a successful long-term outcome for Disney and its shareholders.', 'III. Disney Has the Right Strategy to Drive Profitable Growth and Value Creation for Shareholders', 'Led by a strong Board and management team, Disney is on the right strategic path. The Company has emerged from one of the most challenging periods in its history and is now fully in the midst of a new era of building for future growth and profitability.', 'We have aggressively executed our key strategic priorities to make Disney’s businesses more efficient and effective, reinvigorated our foundational creative engines and sharpened our focus on our greatest brand and franchise assets. We’ve done this while cutting costs – ~$7.5 billion in cost reductions targeted by the end of FY24 – and are continuing to seek additional efficiencies without compromising our commitment to quality, growth and value creation.', 'Given our strong balance sheet and commitment to cost cutting, we returned to paying our shareholders a cash dividend of $0.30 per share in respect of the second half of FY23 on January 10, 2024. This is a strong starting point, from which we see ample opportunity to continue to increase shareholder returns in the future as earnings and cash flow grow.', 'Disney’s Building Priorities', 'We are intently focused on achieving significant and sustained growth and profitability in our Streaming business. Disney built a leading Direct to Consumer (""DTC"") platform in only four years and we are continuing to improve our DTC offerings with high quality content, best-in-class proprietary advertising tools and a more unified experience that are intended to result in more subscriptions, higher engagement and lower churn. During our Q423 earnings call, we reiterated our expectation of achieving profitability in streaming by the end of FY24 and are working to deliver attractive profit margins in the future.', 'For the past 100 years, our Film Studios have produced some of the most iconic stories and characters, generating value across the entire company. We are intensely focused on strengthening the creative output of our film studios to bring joy to the next generation of audiences with our creative excellence.', 'We are committed to telling great stories, leaning into our core brands and franchises and reducing overall output to enable us to concentrate on fewer projects and maintain the highest levels of quality. To that end, we are targeting a $4.5 billion reduction of annual entertainment cash content spend to focus on a more selective, high-quality slate. As we restore creativity to the heart of our business, we are also continuing our efforts around the creation of fresh and compelling original IP.', 'With ESPN, we have the world’s leading sports media brand and plan to transform it into the preeminent digital sports platform. We are confident in the value of sports, demonstrated by ESPN’s immense popularity and its growth in both revenue and operating income over the past two fiscal years amidst a backdrop of notable linear industry declines. As we prepare ESPN for a streaming future, there are enormous opportunities to reach fans in compelling new ways and fully integrate key features into our primary digital ESPN offering.', 'Additionally, we are optimistic about the prospect of strategic relationships for ESPN to assist with content, marketing and distribution.', 'Disney is also prioritizing strategic investments to turbocharge growth in our Experiences business, and is planning to invest ~$60 billion in capital over the next 10 years to enhance and expand domestic and international parks, as well as cruise line capacity. We know the attractive return prospects of these investments for shareholders and are confident in the growth potential of these investments given our wealth of IP, innovative technology, buildable land and unmatched creativity.', 'Overall, our progress and building strategy have been recognized by investor ValueAct Capital, which supports the Board’s recommended nominees.

As legacy technologies transition to digital platforms, we believe Disney can lead the media industry forward,"" said Mason Morfit, Co-CEO of ValueAct.', 'IV. Disney is On the Right Path to Deliver Results for its Shareholders', 'After 100 years, we know Disney continues to have an enduring positive impact on generations of people around the world.

(“Jay”) Rasulo for election to the Disney Board of Directors (the “Board”) at the Company’s 2024 Annual Meeting of Shareholders and released a letter to its fellow Disney shareholders. The full text of the letter is below and available to view online at: https://restorethemagic.com/02-01-24/.', 'February 1, 2024', 'Dear Fellow Walt Disney Company Shareholder:', 'The Trian Group1 owns more than $3 billion of shares of The Walt Disney Company.', 'Like you, we are enthusiastic owners of this iconic company because we believe Disney is the leading media and entertainment business, with outstanding assets: ', 'Beloved franchises like Star Wars and Marvel;', 'Disney and Pixar Animation Studios, which produced some of the greatest films of all time;', 'Theme parks and cruise lines that attract millions of people from around the world each year; and', 'Disney+, an emerging streaming giant with a library of enviable content.', 'Disney occupies a unique place in the hearts of millions of people with its deep history of captivating stories while creating unforgettable experiences.', 'Despite Disney’s enviable and unique position in media and entertainment, its stock price is half what it was less than three years ago and Disney shareholders – like you and us – have collectively lost nearly $200 billion of our investment in that time.2 Disney’s recent creative efforts have disappointed its once-loyal customer base and have caused losses for shareholders. Disney was forced to cut its dividend and only recently restored it3 – meanwhile shareholders missed out on more than $12 billion in expected distributions between 2020 and 2023.4', 'Disney’s stock is down over the last one, three and five years. In fact, over those time periods, Disney’s total shareholder return (“TSR”) has significantly underperformed the stocks of other media and entertainment companies, despite Disney’s superior assets, capabilities and businesses. Disney’s TSR has underperformed the S&P 500 by a wide margin over each of those time periods, too.5', 'One year ago, three years ago, five years ago or ten years ago, you would have been far better served investing in an index fund like the S&P 500, or in a basket of Disney’s self-selected peers, than in Disney itself.6 Instead, you, like us, have been caught in the Disney mousetrap.', 'With so many powerful competitive advantages, why has Disney cost shareholders so much?', 'The simple answer: Disney has lost its way!', 'The Company’s creative engine has stalled. For the first time in nearly a decade, Disney has lost its position as the highest-grossing movie studio.7 Disney’s last five films have collectively cost over $1 billion to produce, and yet two of those films have lost money, and another barely eked out a profit.8 Disney’s reputation as the world’s preeminent entertainment company – and the flywheel that drives its business – is at risk.', 'Disney+, the emerging streaming business, has been poorly managed. Since the service was launched in 2019, Disney+ has failed to achieve profitability in any fiscal year. And while Netflix generates attractive profits, margins and cash flow from its streaming service, success at Disney+ has been elusive. Today, Netflix generates approximately 21 cents of profit for every dollar of revenue; in its 2023 fiscal year, Disney lost approximately 14 cents for every dollar of streaming revenue.9 In total, the streaming businesses have cost the Company more than $14 billion in operating losses over the last six years.10', 'ESPN is challenged and lacks a clear strategy. ESPN is one of the most respected brands in sports media, but the once-lucrative business has suffered as cord-cutting has accelerated and sports rights costs have dramatically increased. ESPN has continued to shed subscribers, and investments into the direct-to-consumer app appear to lack clear return targets and payback is uncertain. Operating income for Disney’s Sports segment, which includes ESPN, dramatically declined in 2023.11', 'Prices have gone up in the Parks even as investment has been deferred. Disney’s parks have long been a crown jewel of the Company and remain an important part of its future. But even though admission prices have increased by more than 35% over the last ten years,12 Disney recently revealed the need to invest a whopping $60 billion into its parks and cruise lines over the next ten years, seemingly to catch up for delayed or deferred investment.13 Disney has failed to answer how it plans to compete with Universal’s new attractions, why it has not kept pace with development, how and where this money will be spent, or what returns shareholders can expect to earn on this massive investment.', 'As a result of these and other issues, and despite spending $200 billion since 2018 on assets and acquisitions (such as the purchase of 21st Century Fox), Disney’s financial performance has suffered. Operating income, free cash flow and earnings per share have declined by 18%, 50% and 85%, respectively, since 2018.14', 'In our view, Disney’s strategic missteps and declining financial performance can be laid at the feet of its Board, which we believe lacks focus, alignment and accountability.', 'Lack of Focus: Many of Disney’s directors have important day jobs running some of the largest automobile, apparel, sporting goods and software companies in the world. They have demanding, full-time work commitments and are likely waking up every day thinking about things other than Disney. Faced with complicated challenges in their executive roles, we believe these busy directors have taken their “eyes off the ball” at Disney.', 'Lack of Alignment: Disney’s non-management directors have amassed great personal wealth, having received in the aggregate more than $700 million in compensation from their jobs at companies other than Disney during their tenures on the Disney Board.15 Yet, despite their significant resources and sizable investment portfolios, Disney’s eleven non-management directors appear to have so little faith in Disney’s future that they have purchased a total of less than $350,000 of Disney stock during their tenures. Nine of them have never bought a single share!16 Relative to their wealth, they have almost no skin in the game. Meanwhile, Disney’s CEO, Bob Iger, has sold nearly all of his Disney stock, reaping proceeds in cash of more than $1 billion; today, he is left owning comparatively few shares.17', 'Lack of Accountability: Despite years of Disney underperformance and shareholder discontent that has been repeatedly expressed at Disney’s annual shareholder meeting votes,18 the Board continues to claim it knows best, refusing to heed input from shareholders or add shareholder-selected directors to the Board who can bring fresh perspectives to Disney’s challenges.', 'We do not believe the current Board can solve Disney’s problems. To Restore the Magic, we need new perspectives, fresh thinking and tangible goals. We certainly do not expect this same Board that has sat idle, watching Disney’s decline, to suddenly change and have the drive to fix Disney. So, to ensure a better future for this great company, we, its owners, must act!', 'We are therefore asking you to elect two new, independent directors – Nelson Peltz and Jay Rasulo – to Disney’s Board of Directors.', 'Nelson Peltz beneficially owns more than $3 billion of Disney stock.19 He is one of the most experienced directors in corporate America, having served on more than a dozen public company boards, including world-class companies and household names like Procter & Gamble, Unilever, Wendy’s, H. J. Heinz and Mondelēz. During his tenure on these and other boards, he has helped create tremendous value for shareholders and drive important initiatives including leadership succession, management compensation realignment, organizational improvements and operational turnarounds.20', 'Jay Rasulo beneficially owns more than $600,000 of Disney stock. He is a Disney veteran who spent three decades at the Company in a variety of roles, including five years as Chief Financial Officer. During his tenure as CFO, Disney’s stock price increased by more than 250% and the Company paid more than $8 billion in dividends to shareholders.21 Prior to being appointed Chief Financial Officer, Mr. Rasulo ran Disney’s Parks and Resorts business, during which time the Parks and Resorts division delivered consistent revenue and operating income growth.', 'Real change is needed! There is much to be done to revive Disney, delight consumers again and drive value for its owners.', 'Disney’s current directors do not want our candidates inside the board room. Perhaps they do not want the hard questions and focus on shareholder value. The Disney Board is seeking to exclude them and appease shareholders with its own appointments, adding two new, hand-selected directors that were chosen without shareholder input. You should be wary of cosmetic “change” orchestrated by the same directors who have consistently failed shareholders.', 'If elected, Nelson Peltz and Jay Rasulo will seek to work diligently and collaboratively with the other Disney directors and management to:', 'Initiate a Board-led review of the Company’s creative processes and structure so that Disney can once again claim its #1 position at the box office while consistently delivering industry-leading content and Disney hallmarks;', 'Insist that management finally develop and implement an executable plan for the streaming business in order to achieve Netflix-like levels of profitability;', 'Have the leadership team commit to a detailed plan that includes a reasonable payback period and return profile for all future investments in the direct-to-consumer ESPN business; ', 'Press management to disclose the expected returns on the $60 billion of announced investments in the Parks and Experiences business; ', 'Align pay and performance for the Company’s senior leaders by tying compensation to clear, measurable and ambitious goals; and', 'Finally execute a successful CEO succession process, while cultivating a deep bench of capable, next-generation leaders.', 'We encourage you to vote “FOR” Nelson Peltz and Jay Rasulo using the instructions on the enclosed BLUE proxy card to enable them to pursue this ambitious agenda.', 'To make room for Nelson Peltz and Jay Rasulo on the Board, you also need to “WITHHOLD” your vote on two of the Board’s current directors. We are strongly recommending shareholders “WITHHOLD” on incumbent directors Michael Froman and Maria Elena Lagomasino.', '“WITHHOLD” on Michael B.G. Froman. Apart from his wife’s long personal relationship with the wife of Disney CEO Bob Iger22, it is unclear to us why Mr. Froman – who has spent much of the past 25 years of his career as a financial executive, a federal trade representative and a national security advisor – was appointed to the Board. It appears that Disney is equally mystified: by the Company’s own admission, Mr. Froman possesses just one skill that is central to Disney’s strategy.23 Mr. Froman has never served on another public company board. He also does not appear to believe in Disney’s future the way we all do: throughout his tenure as a director, he has never bought even a single share of Disney stock with his own money. ', '“WITHHOLD” on Maria Elena Lagomasino. Ms. Lagomasino has Chaired Disney’s Compensation Committee since 2019 and has been a member of that Committee since 2015. During her tenure on the Compensation Committee, Ms. Lagomasino has overseen payments of over $800 million to Disney’s executives24 while shareholders have suffered, with Disney’s stock losing nearly 20% of its value and your dividend being significantly reduced.25 Among other things, Ms. Lagomasino oversaw the awarding of a four-year compensation package to CEO Bob Iger valued at more than $250 million26 in connection with the value-destructive, but Board endorsed (and unanimously approved), 21st Century Fox acquisition. Furthermore, Ms. Lagomasino’s background in wealth management appears unrelated to any of Disney’s businesses and, like Mr. Froman, Ms. Lagomasino possesses just one skill that is central to Disney’s strategy, according to Disney’s own analysis.27', 'We are also asking that you “WITHHOLD” your vote on the three candidates nominated by Blackwells Capital LLC.', 'Together, we can Restore the Magic at Disney!', 'Vote using the enclosed BLUE proxy card.', 'About Trian Fund Management, L.P.', 'Founded in 2005, Trian Fund Management, L.P.

Our new programs are working to eliminate barriers so more customers can reap these benefits, particularly those facing financial barriers and those who reside in communities most adversely impacted by pollution and air quality issues.""', 'To make EVs more accessible, the program offers the highest rebates and reserves 50 percent of funds for equity-eligible communities, including low-income customers and customers living in Equity Investment Eligible Communities (EIEC), as defined by the state of Illinois. This EV charger and installation rebate program is part of a multi-year investment by ComEd, launched last year to accelerate adoption of electrified technologies, including EVs. Efforts to boost EV charging access for customers are key to advancing the goal of 1 million EVs on Illinois roads by 2030 set by the State’s Climate and Equitable Jobs Act (CEJA).', 'EVs are on the rise in Illinois, with 93,000 registered statewide, including 80,000 EVs driving in ComEd’s service territory, up from 17,000 electric vehicles in the region in 2019. Despite the many environmental and cost savings benefits of EVs, barriers to their adoption continue to exist, including upfront financial costs, range anxiety (the fear that the EV battery charge won’t cover the distance you are traveling), and the cost to purchase or install EV infrastructure like EV chargers. The new charger rebate program for residential customers aims to significantly expand access to charging equipment, eliminating one of the key demonstrated barriers to EV adoption. This new ComEd program will further increase access to EVs, building on the Illinois state EV rebate program and federal EV tax credits for new and used EV’s that are helping make EV ownership available to more people.', 'EVs provide numerous benefits for customers. Not only do they offer fuel and maintenance cost savings and performance benefits, but communities can experience broad environmental improvements from reduced tailpipe emissions. Additionally, electrifying transportation—including cars, trucks and public transit fleets—can create tangible health benefits for all communities and families across northern Illinois, especially communities which have traditionally borne the brunt of climate change and air pollution.', '""With dangerous air pollution still a regional challenge and with the burdens of asthma weighing more heavily on lower income communities, this new EV program will help reduce air pollution from the largest source in northern Illinois and make owning a clean, zero-emission vehicle more affordable precisely where they can provide the greatest health benefits,"" said Brian Urbaszewski, Director of Environmental Health Programs at Respiratory Health Association.', '""Rebates are key to making EV ownership more accessible in our communities,"" said Mary Ellen Guest, Executive Director of the Chicago Bungalow Association. ""This program will help our members, especially those on the South and West sides of the City, to add in-home charging to further reduce reliance on fossil fuels on the road.""', '""ComEd’s investments to expand EV adoption will support our regional efforts to address climate change and enhance air quality by reducing tailpipe emissions,"" said Kevin Burns, Metropolitan Mayors Caucus Chairman of the Executive Board, Environmental Committee and Energy Subcommittee. ""New rebate programs from ComEd will complement the work our local governments are doing to develop infrastructure, policy and to lay the framework for an equitable EV future here in northern Illinois.""', 'New residential rebates are just one aspect of ComEd’s beneficial electrification investments. Coming soon, ComEd will launch business and public sector rebates for EVs and make-ready charging infrastructure – with a focus on serving businesses, mass transit agencies, and local governments, among other eligible customers. All together, these efforts seek to promote equitable access to EVs, lower costs of EV adoption for customers and communities, and accelerate the buildout of a regional network of EV charging to serve more customers – a key factor to growing EV adoption.', 'Using ComEd’s free EV Toolkit, residential, business, and public sector customers can generate detailed information about EV conversion cost savings and learn more about a variety of charging options and how to select the right choice to suit their needs at home, based on their driving habits. Also, customers can discover how to find publicly available charging near them.

With us today are John Lindsay, President and CEO and Mark Smith, Senior Vice President and CFO. Both John and Mark will be sharing some comments with us after which we'll open the call for questions.

You'll find the GAAP reconciliation comments and calculations in yesterday's press release. With that said, I'll turn the call over to John Lindsay."", ""John Lindsay: Thank you, Dave, and hello, everyone. Thank you for joining us today. The company continued to perform well, closing out calendar year 2023, despite the persistent volatility in crude oil and natural gas prices. During the quarter, and for most of the last year, frankly, the company's stock price continued to trade, as it has historically, with a strong correlation to crude oil prices and rig count. Decoupling from these traditional commodity measures requires proving our ability to maintain returns above our cost of capital through the cycles, and I believe our fiscal first quarter results are another step in that direction. The North American Solutions segment exited the first fiscal quarter at 151 active rigs, which was at the lower end of our guidance range."", ""We increased our rig count during Q1, but the expectations we had for incremental rig ads were tempered to some extent by the ongoing churn that we are still experiencing in the market. We added four rigs during our first fiscal quarter and expect to add another three to eight rigs during our second fiscal quarter, exiting in the range of 154 to 159 rigs. Our rig count today is at 154 rigs, so we've already added three rigs forward to-date. I'm very pleased with our North America Solutions team's effort to provide the drilling outcomes our customer's desire, drive our value proposition, and maintain reasonable margins in the face of the volatile market. During the first fiscal quarter, the company delivered direct margins that were higher on a sequential basis, indicating that our direct margins, like our rig count, look to have experienced a trough during our fourth fiscal quarter of 2023."", 'Looking out to the March quarter, we project our North America Solutions direct margins to remain relatively stable. Now looking back, the industry super-spec rig count declined in calendar 2023, and there are a couple of things worth pointing out. First, much of the decline occurred during the first six months in the more gassy basins. The decline in the number of non-super-spec rigs was about the same in terms of the decline in the number of super-spec rigs, but the decline was double on a percentage basis, given the dwindling number of non-super-spec rigs remaining in the market. As a consequence, the number of super-spec rigs working as a percentage of the overall fleet is above 70%, illustrating that the replacement cycle and high-grading contracting behaviors continue.', ""The second is rather a data point that helps put things in perspective from where we stand, and that is our rig count in the Permian Basin at the end of calendar year '22 was approximately 98 rigs at the end of the calendar year, and for calendar year 2023, it was approximately 96 rigs. We see this as indicative of our positioning in the market and the value we provide, as well as the nature of our customer base and their desires for better drilling outcomes. Along those lines, we see that greater demand for technology and reliability remain dominant trends in the industry. The higher specification equipment and technology of the Super-Spec fleet deliver the higher levels of performance and value required for the unconventional drilling plans that now dominate the U.S. market."", ""And this speaks directly to a very important element within our contract economics, which is the operational costs involved in providing our services. Over the past two years, we've experienced increases in operational expenses due to rising labor costs and consumable inventory consumption and cost inflation. A less visible but growing variable is the cost acceleration on equipment related to running H&P's FlexRig fleet harder than ever before to achieve more complex well designs, lateral length, and the drilling efficiencies required from our customers. Let me expand on an example of service intensity. In the last 10 years, for H&P, the average lateral length drilled has more than doubled to over 10,000 feet. And at the same time, the well cycle times have improved by approximately 22%."", ""This means that each FlexRig today drills approximately four and a half more wells on average per year, and those rigs have doubled the exposure per well to the resource. This performance improves outcomes for our customer, and in return, we are focused on getting appropriately compensated to drive financial returns through the cycles. Now shifting to our international solution segment. We're very pleased with the recent developments that are proof of our execution on our international expansion strategy. The company recently received preliminary notification subject to finalization of contractual agreements that it has been awarded seven Super-Spec FlexRigs for work in a drilling campaign in the Middle East. These rigs are expected to commence operations shortly after delivery, which is currently scheduled for the first half of fiscal 2025."", ""Additionally, these rigs will be sourced from our idle Super-Spec rigs in the U.S., converted to walking configurations, and further equipped to suit contractual specifications. We believe that H&P is uniquely positioned for this award as we are able to invest in and utilize some of our high quality idle Super-Spec rigs that are available in the U.S., combined with our immense drilling experience and expertise. Furthermore, in the Middle East, we've been successful in contracting an additional rig in Bahrain. The Super-Spec rig to be utilized for this work is already located in the region, and it is expected to commence operations during the summer of 2024. These are positive outcomes in our Middle East expansion strategy, and I want to express my appreciation for the grip and determination our teams put forth to accomplish what we have to this point, and we look forward to further growth in the future."", ""Strategically, we will continue to look for opportunities to invest in projects with attractive returns so that we maintain our industry lead in the U.S. and develop further growth internationally. In addition to operational and growth accomplishments, we believe an essential ingredient in achieving shareholder success is having a multi-pronged approach to capital allocation. First and foremost, we prioritize the company's long-standing posture of a strong financial position and fiscal prudence. Secondly, we seek to return capital to shareholders through an established base dividend augmented by supplemental dividends and share repurchases when those opportunities exist. Mark will provide the details about the progress of our plan in his remarks."", ""In closing, every year energy industry challenges arise, many resulting from supply and demand dynamics that ultimately result in crude oil and natural gas volatility and the cyclical nature of oil and gas. As difficult as it is to manage in these times, we also find that headwinds often provide opportunities to showcase the exceptional capabilities of our fleet and to demonstrate the value our people, our technology and processes bring to providing drilling solutions for our customers. For our part, we will remain focused on our goals and execute toward their achievement in the long term. And now I'll turn the call over to Mark."", 'Mark Smith: Thanks, John. Today I will review our fiscal first quarter 2024 operating results, provide guidance for the second quarter, update remaining full fiscal year 2024 guidance is appropriate and comment on our financial position. Let me start with highlights for the recently completed first fiscal quarter ended December 31, 2023. The company generated quarterly revenues of $677 million versus $660 million from the previous quarter. As expected, the quarterly increase in revenue was due primarily to sequentially higher revenues in North America Solutions segment. Total direct operating costs were $404 million for the first quarter versus $410 million for the previous quarter. This decrease is attributable to lower sequential direct expenses in the international segment.', ""General and administrative expenses were approximately $57 million for the first quarter, which was in line with our expectations. During the first quarter, we recognized the loss of approximately $4 million primarily related to the change in the fair market value of our equity investments, which is part of the loss on investment securities reported in our consolidated statement of operations. Our Q1 effective tax rate was approximately 24%, which was at the lower end of our previously guided range for the quarter due to adjustments to our foreign tax expectations. To summarize this quarter's results, H&P earned a profit of $0.94 per diluted share versus $0.77 in the previous quarter. As highlighted in our press release, first quarter earnings per share were negatively impacted by a net $0.03 loss per share of select items consisting of the aforementioned loss on investment securities."", ""Absent to select item adjusted diluted earnings per share were $0.97 in the first fiscal quarter versus an adjusted $0.69 during the fourth fiscal quarter. Capital expenditures for the first quarter of fiscal 2024 were $136 million, which was $22 million more than the previous quarter's spend as some items originally forecasted in fiscal 2023 CapEx moved to fiscal 2024 as expected. I will comment later on our fiscal '24 capital expenditure guidance, but we'll just state here that it is unchanged. Q1 cash flow from operations is at $175 million was higher than our internal expectations as the timing of our tax payments shifted from December to early January. As a reminder, our Q1 cash flows are typically influenced by seasonal factors such as the payment of accrued annual incentive compensation, tax payments, as well as other seasonal working capital changes."", ""This Q1 was impacted by accrued annual incentive comp as well as increased working capital as rig activity in the North America Solutions segment was higher following the bottoming of our rig count in Q4 fiscal 2023. I will address the company's cash position later in my remarks. Turning to our three segments, beginning with the North America Solutions segment, we averaged 149 contracted rigs during the first quarter, flat from the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023 as the rig count bottomed in September and then turned up through Q1. The exit rate count of 151 was toward the low end of our guided range of between 150 and 156 as churn continued per John's earlier comment. Said differently, our modest expectations for incremental rig additions in Q1 were tempered by this churn in the market, while demand is present for Super-Spec rigs, net rig additions were lower due to new rig awards, essentially replacing rigs being sidelined due to churn."", ""Revenues increased sequentially by $19 million, primarily due to lower price term contracts rolling the current market rates. Segment direct margin was $256 million, which is just above the high end of our guidance and sequentially higher than the previous quarter, which came in at $239 million. Performance contracts continued to make up approximately 50% of total contracted rigs in the first quarter. Total segment expenses are relatively flat at $19,600 per day in the first quarter compared to $19,800 per day in the previous quarter. Looking ahead to the second quarter of fiscal 2024 for North America Solutions, as of today's call, we have 154 rigs contracted as the rig churn has continued, resulting in their activity level gradually increasing thus far in the quarter."", 'This is consistent with the line of sight we had for activity in November. We expect to end our second fiscal quarter with between 154 and 159 working rigs. Revenue backlog from our North America Solutions fleet remained at roughly $1.1 billion for rigs under term contract. As of today, approximately 60% of the U.S. active fleet is on a term contract. Average pricing per day should remain relatively flat up, slightly, as some remaining legacy term rate rigs roll over to the spot market. In the North America Solutions segment, we expect direct margins in fiscal Q2 to range between $255 to $275 million. We expect cost in Q2 to decline sequentially in part due to lower recommissioning expenses associated with putting active churn rigs into new contracts as opposed to idle rigs.', ""Next to our International Solutions segment. International Solutions activity ended the first fiscal quarter with 12 rigs on contract. International Solutions results were slightly above our guidance range as an Argentina rig release was pushed back one month into the second quarter. Note that our previous guidance range excluded foreign exchange impacts, which reduced these reported results by approximately $2 million. This loss was primarily due to Argentina's devaluation of its Peso relative to the Dollar by approximately 55% in December of '23. As we look toward the second quarter of fiscal '24 for international, as we mentioned in the press release, we will idle our remaining active rig in Colombia, as well as the one rig in Argentina I previously mentioned resulting in eight active rigs in that country."", 'With regard to the Middle East expansion, John announced earlier, the one rig award in Bahrain will utilize the Super-Spec FlexRig exported last year to our Middle East hub. This additional Bahrain rig, as well as the Saudi Arabia rig awarded in August of 23, should both start sometime in the summer of 2024. The seven Middle East rigs we were recently notified about are expected to start shortly after delivery, which is scheduled to occur through the first half of our fiscal 2025. We expect to incur approximately $4 million of operating expense in fiscal Q2 in preparation of rigs for export. In the second quarter, we therefore expect to earn $1 million to $3 million in direct margin, aside from any foreign exchange impacts in the international segment.', 'Finally, to our offshore Gulf of Mexico segment, we have three of our seven offshore platform rigs contracted. We also have management contracts on three customer-owned rigs, one of which is on active rate. The offshore segment generated a direct margin of $6 million during the quarter, which was in line with our guidance range. As we look toward the second quarter of fiscal 2024 for the offshore Gulf of Mexico segment, we expect to be roughly flat and generate between $4 million to $7 million of direct margin. Now let me update full fiscal year 2024 guidance as appropriate. We expect the timing of our CapEx spend to vary from quarter-to-quarter. As mentioned on our November call, our original guidance included delays that continued to push some plan to maintenance CapEx from fiscal 2023 to fiscal 2024, resulting in moderately higher CapEx in fiscal Q1.', 'Capital expenditures for the full fiscal 2024 year are still expected to be between $450 million to $500 million. As previously discussed, our 2024 guidance includes international growth capital, which is inclusive of converting idle U.S. rigs to walking, recertifying certain equipment to like new, conducting required rig modifications, and purchasing specific equipment for Middle East contract opportunities. The seven rig award notification will require $30 million to $35 million in total of additional capital in fiscal 2025. If procurement timing expectations change, then we will update guidance as appropriate in future quarters. As discussed on our November call, we planned approximately 14 walking, rig convergence in fiscal 2024. Seven of these are now allocated to the Middle East award, with the remaining up to seven to be allocated in the U.S., depending on customer demand and attractive rates and terms.', 'As we have said on prior calls, we are marketing our Super-Spec FlexRigs internationally for the work they were designed for and have excelled at in the U.S. And as we have stated for some time, exporting idle U.S. Super-Spec FlexRig to international fit for purpose opportunities increases our fleet-wide utilization, exposes H&P to markets with longer-term contract profiles, starts to reduce U.S. concentration, and alleviates long idle U.S. supply. As previously mentioned, our expectations for general and administrative expenses for the full fiscal 2024 year remain at $230 million. We still estimate our annual effective tax rate to be in the range of 24% to 29%, with the variance above the U.S. statutory rate of 21%, attributed to permanent book-to-tax differences and state and foreign income taxes.', 'We continue to project a fiscal year 2024 cash tax range of $150 million to $200 million, including approximately $90 million paid in Q2. Now looking at our financial position, H&P had cash and short-term investments of approximately $298 million at December 31, 2023, versus an equivalent $350 million at September 30. The sequentially decreased cash balance is largely attributable to our Q1 share repurchases of approximately $47 million. Approximately 1.3 million shares were repurchased in fiscal Q1 for this $47 million. Calendar 2023 repurchases totaled approximately 7 million shares for about $256 million at an average price of about $36.50 per share, which reduced our shares outstanding from the beginning of calendar 2023 by about 7%. Our calendar year 2024 share repurchase authorization has been reset to the evergreen level of 4 million shares.', ""The fiscal Q1 stock repurchases, together with the base and supplemental dividends paid in December, resulted in approximately $90 million of return to shareholders. We expect some quarterly variability around our free cash flow generation due to rig activity, working capital changes, and the timing of CapEx spent. That said, based on this quarter's results and our projections for the remainder of the fiscal year, we still forecast that we will be generating ample cash flow to cover capital expenditures, the base and supplemental dividends. And as we have said before, cash generated in excess of these priorities, together with excess accumulated cash on hand, is available for opportunistic share repurchases or other accretive investment opportunities."", 'That concludes our prepared comments for the first fiscal quarter.

We delivered 9% organic growth across our solutions businesses during the quarter where market services was flat. For the full year, net revenues of $3.9 billion increased 9% from 2022 or 5% on an organic basis. Solutions generated 7% organic -- annual organic revenue growth, which is consistent with our overall solutions revenue outlook, despite a dynamic market environment. Our market services revenue were flat year-over-year, primarily due to continued muted volumes in Europe on the back of strong performance in 2022. Our annualized recurring revenue, or ARR, ended the year at $2.6 billion, an organic increase of 6% year-over-year. This slower IPO environment as well as lower buying activity by corporates for our IR solutions contributed to a more modest growth in ARR in 2023.', ""Annualized SaaS revenues increased to $910 million in the fourth quarter of 2023. Excluding Adenza, this represented a 12% growth rate and 38% of total company ARR. Across the company, we accomplished revenue growth and business expansion while maintaining our operating margin at 52% for both the quarter and the full year basis, excluding Adenza. Our strong performance in 2023, illustrates the strength of our diversified business and ability to deliver against our longer-term objectives in an unpredictable environment. We did this while taking an important strategic step in Nasdaq's evolution. On November 1, we were pleased to complete the Adenza acquisition and we are now working as one team to further our clients' goals for risk management and regulatory reporting excellence."", ""Reflecting on the past year, I'm extremely proud of Nasdaq's team's accomplishments. With the establishment of our divisional structure and the Adenza acquisition, 2023 was a transformational year for our business. Throughout the year, we achieved several major milestones to deepen our client relationships and advance to our vision to be the trusted fabric of the world's financial system. Now let's review the highlights of our operating -- operational accomplishments and client successes by division, starting with Capital Access Platforms. As you know, at Nasdaq, our exchanges are our foundation. We maintained our position as the premier US exchange for IPOs with an 81% US operating company win rate in 2023. In total, we welcomed 103 operating company IPOs that raised more than $11 billion in proceeds, marking Nasdaq's fifth consecutive year as the leading US listing exchange in terms of both number of IPOs and proceeds raised."", 'In addition, 18 companies representing $377 billion in market value switched their listings to Nasdaq during the year. In Index, we had $31 billion of net inflows for the year, including $10 billion in the fourth quarter. Our clients want -- our clients launched 83 new products linked to Nasdaq indices during the year, bringing to market robust solutions in line with investor demand. Beyond our exchange and Index leadership, we are a leading source of institutional intelligence to the buy side through investments and have continued to expand our offering into alternatives in ESG. We continue to broaden our ESG Solutions in 2023, launching multiple new offerings to help corporates and investors navigate an evolving ESG ecosystem, including Nasdaq Metrio and eVestment ESG Analytics.', 'We also introduced a suite of new solutions designed to help corporate clients drive governance excellence and accelerate their ESG strategies, including Sustainable Lens through IR Insight. Turning to the FinTech division. With the completion of our Adenza acquisition, we have created a financial technology powerhouse of Anti-Financial Crime, Surveillance, Market Technology, and Risk and Regulatory reporting solutions that positions us as a key risk management partner to the global financial system. Our Calypso solution helps financial institutions navigate a range of market conditions, providing a live view of risk across proprietary and client trading portfolios with detailed analytics to support real time risk management decision-making.', ""Similarly, in an increasingly complex and fragmented global regulatory environment where risks need to be managed in shorter timelines at a granular level, our AxiomSL solution enables our clients to benefit from the Nasdaq's global scale and expertise. We now can be a comprehensive partner to banks, brokers, financial market infrastructure providers, and investment managers worldwide by helping them maximize their liquidity through world class capital markets in risk management technology, as well as by enhancing integrity across the banking system through our regulatory reporting and Anti-Financial Crime suite of solutions. With the closing of Adenza, we're fully focused on engaging with our clients and new employees to ensure a smooth and successful transition and integration."", ""Tal Cohen, Nasdaq's Co-President and Leader of the FinTech division and I have personally been speaking with our clients over the past few months and there is a lot of excitement around the potential opportunities now that Adenza is part of Nasdaq. Adenza finished the year with strong sales and upsells across its solutions. Specifically, in the last two months, we signed six new clients, including two central banks. We also expanded our relationships with 35 existing clients. For the full year, Adenza added 23 new clients and expanded our relationships with 142 existing clients, including three cross-sells. We are thrilled to enter 2024 with Adenza as part of Nasdaq and we're very excited to drive the business and the solutions to new heights in the years ahead."", ""Turning to market technology. In 2023, we bolstered our global client footprint with the addition of seven clients, including four in the fourth quarter. We also expanded our relationships with four clients in the fourth quarter and more than 10 clients for the full year. Importantly, we had key technology client signings in APAC and in the LATAM regions. We are proud to forge new technology partnership with nuam exchange, which is the consolidation of marketplaces across Peru, Chile, and Colombia. We also expanded our relationship with Chile's central securities depository with capabilities to manage digitized assets and with B3 in Brazil to develop a new clearing solution, and with BMV in Mexico to modernize this entire post-trade technology platform."", ""Our growing customer relationship highlights the importance of the Financial Technology we provide, which powers resilient and liquid markets around the world. In our Anti-Financial Crime suite of solutions, we're bringing world-leading technology coupled with our consortium dataset from 2,500 banks that fights the growing threat of financial crime in the global financial system. Our inaugural Global Financial Crime Report which was conducted in partnership with outside experts, estimates that over $3 trillion of illicit funds flow through the global financial system and $500 billion is lost abroad. It's an enormous challenge that requires collective action across the banking sector, the public sector and the embrace of advanced technology."", ""We are very proud of our role in fighting financial crime, and we're finding tremendous opportunity to continue to expand our capabilities across the banking sector. In 2023, we reached a significant milestone in our Anti-Financial Crime growth strategy. During the year, Verafin our fraud and AML solutions signed its first three Tier 1 banks as well as four Tier 2 banks, including one Tier 1 client and one Tier 2 client in the fourth quarter. We also partnered with a growing number of small and medium-sized financial institutions for a total of 237 new clients this year and 100 for the fourth quarter alone. Additionally, we developed our first proprietary Verafin GenAI Copilot, which is now in beta with our customers. Our GenAI tools reduce time and resources spent on manual tasks and processes such as alert reviews, research and documentation."", ""By increasing our operational efficiency, Verafin enables our clients to invest in resilient growth at an attractive ROI. In Surveillance, we signed 27 new clients in 2023, including six in the fourth quarter. We made significant strides in modernizing our solutions by launching a new cloud-based architecture and capabilities within Surveillance user interfaces. These innovations give our clients the ability to calibrate their Surveillance setup more efficiently and effectively. Today, 50% of Nasdaq Trade Surveillance clients, leverage our cloud-deployed solutions which support access to 200 sophisticated alerts across more than 160 markets globally. As we continue to enhance our surveillance capabilities, we're encouraged by the early adoption of our NextGen cloud architecture and new user interfaces."", ""Moving onto Market Services, in the fourth quarter, we maintained our strong 72% market share for our cash equities markets in the Nordics against the challenging volume environment across the European markets. We've also continued to demonstrate a leading market position in the US equities and options markets. In the fourth quarter, we benefited from robust closing cross volumes from the S&P, MSCI and our own Nasdaq rebalance events and we continue to experience growth -- growing adoption of our NDX Index Options product. Additionally, we continue to advance the modernization of markets with the successful migration of our second half US options market to the AWS cloud infrastructure and with the SEC approval of the first AI-powered order type called Dynamic M-ELO, which we expect to launch in the first quarter of 2024."", ""Altogether, we're moving with speed while delivering revenue growth at an attractive margin profile that will drive shareholder value. With the year ahead now in focus, I'd like to share our enterprise priorities for 2024. Our first priority is to continue the successful integration of Adenza. We've made great progress in the initial phase of the integration and remain confident in our ability to deliver on the goals that we laid out at the time of the deal. Second, we're accelerating the impact of our divisional structure to activate and unlock new opportunities that will drive our business into the future. Over the past year, we have delivered significant progress across each of our business divisions and we will continue to realize the benefits of this structure in 2024."", ""Third, we are institutionalizing client listening across the company to unlock revenue growth through a One Nasdaq approach to our client engagements. In 2024, we have a focused program to organize our client data, advance our CRM and other related systems, and enhance our processes across the enterprise to gain a holistic understanding of our clients with a goal to drive partnerships in cross-selling opportunities going forward. And fourth, we will further amplify the impact that AI has on the business and in our products. Nasdaq is leveraging several critical components to ensure AI is implemented safely, securely and fairly. And through our focus on AI, coupled with the vast proprietary data sets that we've created over decades in our markets and in our solutions covering investment analytics, investor relations and Anti-Financial Crime, we're confident that we can extend Nasdaq's competitive advantage in the years ahead."", ""We look forward to updating you on our progress on these priorities at Investor Day and in the quarters to come. To wrap up, 2023 was another year defined by significant strategic and operational milestones and strong execution. As we look ahead to 2024, we're well-positioned to better serve our clients more holistically as we become the trusted fabric of the world's financial system. And with that, I will now turn the call over to Sarah to review our financial details."", ""Sarah Youngwood: Thank you, Adena, and good morning everyone. I am thrilled to be here for my first earnings call at Nasdaq. I could not be more excited to join the firm at such a transformational time and I look forward to seeing many of you at Investor Day. Now, I will turn to our financial results. My commentary will be focused on non-GAAP results and year-on-year growth rate will be provided on an organic basis. Similarly, operating margins will be discussed ex-Adenza for comparability purposes. I will discuss Adenza's [generic] (ph) results at the end of the fintech section. Before we move to the quarter, I would like to give you the highlights for the full year 2023 starting on Slide 12 of the earnings presentation. In an uncertain environment, we delivered solid financial performance and strong cash flow generation."", 'Revenue of $3.9 billion was up 5%, with solutions revenue of $2.9 billion, an increase of 7%. Non-GAAP expense was $1.8 billion, up 5%, in line with guidance for a 52% operating margin, which was flat versus the prior year. This resulted in diluted EPS of $2.82, reflecting organic growth of 6%. We had $1.6 billion of free cash flow ex-Adenza, a growth rate of 11%. Moving on to the fourth quarter on Slide 13. We reported revenue of $1.1 billion, up 7%, with Solutions revenue of $860 million, an increase of 9%. Non-GAAP expense was $504 million, up 2%, and with an operating margin of 52%, up 3 percentage points. Overall, this resulted in diluted EPS of $0.72, reflecting organic growth of 11%. Turning to Slide 14. ARR totaled $2.6 billion, up 6% organically.', ""The annualized SaaS revenue totaled $910 million, representing organic growth of 12%. Excluding Adenza, SaaS was 38% of ARR, an improvement of 2 percentage points. Including Adenza, that number is 35%, which will improve as the cloud portion of their revenue increases. As a reminder, we only consider the cloud portion of their revenue to be SaaS. Let's review division results for the quarter starting on Slide 15. For capital access platforms, revenue of $461 million increased 10%, driven by excellent performance in Index. In Data and Listing Services, we saw 3% growth. In data, we have seen a continued increase in proprietary data revenues, driven largely by higher international demand. In listings, the positive impact of pricing was partially offset by the combined impact of de-listings, a muted IPO environment and the rollup of prior year's initial listings revenue."", 'Workflow and Insights revenue increased 3%. Analytics delivered high single digit growth, reflecting our ability to monetize the value of our data to the buy side with new business and increased pricing across traditional and alternative asset managers. The strength in analytics was partially offset by a weaker capital raising markets and the impact of elongated sales cycle in corporate solutions. Index revenue increased 26% and overall AUM grew by 34%. Over the last 12 months, our net inflows were $31 billion, $10 billion of which occurred during the fourth quarter. Licensing revenues for futures contracts linked to the Nasdaq 100 Index increased as well, driven by higher capture partially offset by a decline in trading volumes. As a reminder, our capture increases once we cross a volume threshold and then resets at the beginning of each year.', ""While smaller in size, Index revenue also benefited from index data revenue growth. ARR for capital access platforms was $1.2 billion, up 3%. ARR growth was largely driven by analytics and to a lesser extent, data and listings. The muted IPO environment impacted ARR growth. However, we are cautiously optimistic that we could see a recovery in IPOs combined with more normalized sales cycles as we progress through 2024. As a reminder, substantially all our Index revenue is excluded from ARR. The division's operating margin was 54% for the quarter, an increase of 4 percentage points due to higher revenues. For the full year, it was 55%, up roughly by 50 basis points. The increase was driven by higher revenues, partially offset by inflation, revenue-related expense, and investments in particular across data and Index."", 'Moving to financial technology on Slide 16. The division delivered revenue of $399 million for the quarter, up 8%. Regulatory technology grew 17% with Verafin at 25%. Verafin added 100 new clients this quarter, including our Tier -- third Tier 1 bank. While we are excited about these additions, as we have previously discussed, the contracting and implementation with these larger, more complex institutions is longer. We will start recognizing subscription revenue in 2024 but we believe that the effect will only accelerate as we expand relationships with these clients. The strong performance of Verafin along with 6% growth in Surveillance led to the 17% growth of regulatory technology. For Surveillance, the fourth quarter growth was impacted by the timing of bookings in 2023 versus 2022, but fundamentals remained strong for the year with six new clients in the fourth quarter and 27 for the full year.', 'We also made inroads with the Tier 3 broker client cohort, which reflects progress beyond our leadership position with large banks. Cloud for trade Surveillance is now above 50% deployment, which is an important driver of client stickiness through the speed and efficiency it enables us to provide. Moving on to Capital Markets Technology, we saw 3% growth driven by data center connectivity demand. We had new market tech contract signings in Latin America and with one of our US Tier 1 clients. We expect these contracts to start to accrue in 2024. As Adena mentioned, we continue to increase our market technology presence in Latin America and to have a leading role in the modernization of markets in the region. ARR for FinTech totaled $1.35 billion, an increase of 10% due to continued customer wins at Verafin as well as growth in Trade Management Services and Market Technology.', ""The division's operating margin in the fourth quarter was 40%, up 4 percentage points. The organic margin expansion reflects solid top line growth and expense control with an overall increase in revenue-related costs, offset by efficiencies and lower professional fees. We are progressing on our journey to improve the efficiencies in Market Technology while continuing to support the growth of Verafin and Surveillance. For the full year, the operating margin was 40%, up 5 percentage points with a story which mirrors that of the quarter, including strong operating leverage and investments. Before closing on FinTech, a few additional words on Adenza. For November and December, Adenza contributed [$149] (ph) million in revenue, $458 million of ARR of which $98 million was in SaaS, and $35 million in non-GAAP operating expense."", ""A strong finish to the year drove a 77% operating margin for our two month ownership. On a full year basis, Adenza had an adjusted EBITDA margin of 59%, ahead of our initial 58% outlook for the year. Let me now talk about Adenza's full year revenue and ARR. Revenue was $583 million in 2023, up 14%. ARR of $458 million with 16%, excluding a significant bankruptcy that occurred during the year or 14% net of it. Both metrics are on a constant currency basis. We had nearly 50% of new ACV coming from cloud this year. The strong cloud take-up by our clients supports our growth and efficiencies. Revenue growth benefited from a large portion of ARR up for renewal in the quarter and in the year. Going forward, we expect Adenza's revenue growth to be in the low to mid-teens, consistent with the medium to long term outlook we provided when we announced the acquisition."", ""The timing of contracts being up for renewal and the mix of revenue between cloud and on-premise delivery will have an impact on revenue growth in any given quarter and year. This is why we are focused on ARR growth, which is not as impacted by annual renewable and delivery method. We'll provide more details on the revenue dynamics of our FinTech division at Investor Day. And wrapping up our divisional overview with Market Services. Net revenue was $247 million for the quarter, roughly flat with growth in US cash equities offset by decreases in US options. US cash equities growth was driven by higher capture, partially offset by lower share. In a very competitive US options environment, we are defending our strong market share lead and our attractive capture."", ""Meanwhile, in Europe, tepid exchange volumes were positively offset by a $7 million nonrecurring payment and by the benefits of diversification between fixed income and equity. The investments we have made in leveraging our technology and data to provide our European market clients with transparency helps them to generate [indiscernible]. This has enabled us to help our clients improve their execution quality and has been key to our ability to reclaim our 72% market share, a 2 percentage point increase. The division's operating margin was 57% in the fourth quarter 2023 compared to 60% in the prior year quarter as a result of higher compensation costs as we continue to invest in our people and higher technology costs due to ongoing investments related to both capacity and migrating US market to the cloud."", ""The full year operating margin for the division totaled 59% with the same drivers as recorded history. Turning to Slide 19. This quarter's non-GAAP operating expense was $504 million, an organic increase of $8 million or 2% versus our organic revenue growth of 7%. I went through the story in the businesses, and it reflects good expense discipline as well as the timing of marketing and professional fees. Overall, this reflects a 52% operating margin, up 3 percentage points. For the full year, our non-GAAP operating expense was $1.83 billion, in line with guidance. We were up 5% consistent with revenue growth for a flat operating margin at 52%. The increase is due to investments in key growth areas, inflation and higher revenue-related expense."", ""We also achieved efficiencies during the year as we continue to optimize our location footprint and bring the divisions together as part of our divisional realignment. If you include Adenza for the full year, operating expense totaled $2.05 billion. Now on to guidance. We are initiating 2024 non-GAAP operating expense guidance of $2.105 billion to $2.185 billion, the midpoint of which reflects pro forma growth of 5%. This includes a full year of Adenza and the in-year expense benefit of net synergies. On an organic basis, excluding Adenza, Nasdaq's expense growth will be just under 4.5%. We will spend more time on synergies at Investor Day, but we reiterate the net $80 million synergy target by the end of 2025 and $80 million cost to achieve are set forth in the restructuring program we just initiated."", ""Additionally, we are guiding the full year tax rate of 24.5% to 26.5% on a non-GAAP basis, slightly higher than 2023, due to lower expected tax benefit on equity awards. Turning to Slide 20. Strong free cash flow continues to be the hallmark of Nasdaq. For the year, we had $1.6 billion of free cash flow ex-Adenza, and Adenza had $306 million in unlevered pretax free cash flow. Our gross leverage ratio was expected to be at 4.7 times at the time of deal close but we are pleased to share that at year-end, we are at 4.3 times despite 0.1 times headwind from euro strength. Let's go through the details on the chart. At the end of the third quarter, our adjusted leverage ratio was 2.4 times. We added the leverage to acquire Adenza. At the beginning of December, we posted share repurchases and repaid $260 million of term loans."", ""The ratio benefited from the incremental EBITDA from Adenza's full year and net tax growth. We expect to continue deleveraging in the first quarter of 2024. And to wrap up on free cash flow utilization, we have repurchased $269 million of our common stock this year, including $110 million in the fourth quarter. And we paid a quarterly dividend of $0.22 per share for a 35% annualized payout ratio. In closing today, this quarter and this year's performance shows Nasdaq's ability to deliver consistent growth, margin and free cash flow in a range of environments. We are committed to disciplined execution and continued innovation. The investment we have made in our resilience, our technology and our data over the years, coupled with our reach and track record, position us for sustainable growth as we power our client's success."", 'Thank you for your time, and I will turn it back to the operator for Q&A.', 'See also Jim Cramer is Bullish on These 10 Stocks and 15 Cheapest Countries to Get Second Citizenship.', 'To continue reading the Q&A session, please click here.']"

With preloaded Jobber app, the solution is likely to eliminate the time-consuming task of loading software applications on a device-by-device basis. The partnership is expected to be budget-friendly for small businesses as they can receive a single combined bill from Verizon and cut on the cost.Due to the low cost of operations, small and mid-sized home service business owners often do not possess the required budget to provide every employee with secured devices for official usage.

There weren't a lot of surprises in the big reveal. The internet is blessed with permit-sleuthing vloggers and helicopter-flying shutterbugs -- a hat tip to @AliciaStella and @bioreconstruct, respectively -- and fans already know most of what will open at Epic Universe in 2025."", ""It doesn't mean that theme park enthusiasts aren't excited. The news makes it that much more real. Fleshing out the rides, restaurants, and experiences winds the clock of expectations. It also winds the clocks on rival Walt Disney (NYSE: DIS). What will the world's leading theme park operator do to counter the attention that its rival a dozen miles away will be generating next year? Does it have to do anything? Let's take a closer look at the battle of two travel and tourism stocks that can still end with both parties winning."", ""Comcast broke ground on Epic Universe five years ago. It was set to open in 2023 until the pandemic and economic concerns paused construction. It's going to be popular with several roller coasters and immersive dark rides that will draw attention to Disney's largest rival."", ""It can use the spark. Disney World's Magic Kingdom was the planet's most visited theme park in 2022 according to the annual TEA/AECOM attendance report, attracting 17.1 million visitors. There were 47 million guests going through the turnstiles of Disney World's four gated attractions, compared to 21.8 million at the two current Universal Orlando theme parks. Epic Universe will be a hit, and it doesn't have cannibalize Comcast's existing parks."", ""The goal here is that three theme parks along with the Volcano Bay water park it introduced in 2017 should be enough for tourists to book weeklong stays without having to leave Universal's property. It doesn't mean that Disney will suffer."", ""Universal hasn't added much since the opening of the second Wizarding World of Harry Potter in the summer of 2014.

So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number."", 'For the last reported quarter, it was expected that Mettler-Toledo would post earnings of $9.63 per share when it actually produced earnings of $9.80, delivering a surprise of +1.77%.', 'Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times.', 'Bottom Line', 'An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.', ""That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success.

Insurance brokers act on behalf of their clients and offer advice, keeping in mind clients' interests, against brokerage fees. Thus, their business is directly linked with clients’ level of business activity. Some of these companies are also involved in providing risk management, third-party administration and managed healthcare services. Per a report by Allied Market Research, the global insurance brokerage market is projected to rise to $628.3 billion by 2032 or at a nine-year (2023-2032) CAGR of 9.3%. Research Dive estimates the industry players to generate $515.3 billion in revenues by 2028 at a seven-year (2021-2028) CAGR of 5.4%. Increased digitization has been helping to improve operational performance."", '3 Trends Shaping the Future of the Insurance Brokerage Industry', 'Increased Demand for Products to Drive Revenues: The operational results of the industry players are affected by clients’ level of business activity, which, in turn, depends on the extent of economic activity in the industries and markets they serve. Thus, the growth of insurance brokers depends on the demand for insurance products, which, in turn, is driven by increased awareness.\xa0 Keeping this in mind, industry players are continually expanding globally, cross-selling products, improving pricing, tightening underwriting standards and designing products that are more appealing to customers and match their risk appetite. Better pricing ensures higher commissions for the industry players. Growth in the aging population is driving demand for retirement benefit products, while the rising population of baby boomers and millennials, as well as increasing awareness, is boosting demand for medical insurance, life insurance, accidental insurance as well as other forms of insurance.\xa0Mergers and Acquisitions: The insurance brokerage industry is witnessing fast-paced consolidation. The industry has been traditionally fragmented, with a number of small players. One of the factors driving mergers and acquisitions is the companies’ need to become specialized in their businesses. Some other factors driving M&A are the interest shown by private equity firms in this sector, growing competition and slow organic growth.\xa0Increased Adoption of Technology: Industry players are focused on leveraging technology and innovation, including artificial intelligence, robotics and blockchain, to simplify and improve client experience, increase efficiencies and alter business models. Accelerated digitalization has helped to curb costs, thus aiding margin expansion. Increased digitization also accelerates claims processing, drives sales and improves retention rate.

The major financial assumptions underlying the midpoint of these estimates are as follows: revenue growth year-over-year on an as adjusted basis; talent solutions down 14% to 19%, Protiviti down 3% to 6%, overall down 10% to 15%; gross margin percentage for contract talent 38% to 41%, Protiviti 20% to 22%, overall 37% to 39%; SG&A as a percentage of revenues, excluding deferred compensation classification impacts, talent solutions 40% to 42%, Protiviti 15% to 17%; overall 32% to 34%; segment income for talent solutions 4% to 7%, Protiviti 4% to 7%; overall 4% to 7%; tax rate 29% to 30%; shares $104 million to $105 million; 2024 capital expenditures and capitalized cloud computing costs, $90 million to $110 million with $15 million to $20 million in the first quarter.', ""Protiviti's first quarter segment income guidance includes the seasonal impact of annual staff promotions and compensation increases, all of which become fully effective on January 1st. This produces a sequential decline in midpoint estimated segment margin of 6 percentage points, which is consistent with the 4 to 7 point decline experienced in most of the last 10 years. We limit our guidance to one quarter. All estimates we provide on this call are subject to the risks mentioned in today's press release and in our SEC filings. Now I'll turn the call back over to Keith."", ""Keith Waddell: Thank you, Mike. While job opening demand continues to be above historical levels and candidate supply remains tight, the velocity of hiring remains impacted and there is less churn in the labor force. The great resignation following COVID has given way to the big stay and employee attrition is down significantly across the globe. That said, the tone of client discussions has improved in the last 90 days due to some combination of lower inflation, a more favorable interest rate policy, fewer predictions of pending [recession] and newly approved staffing levels resulting from the annual budget cycle. These factors contribute to a more positive backdrop heading into 2024 than we saw a year ago. We're optimistic about our opportunities for the year ahead, starting with the reacceleration in the velocity of hiring and the more normalized labor churn that typically follows when client and candidate confidence improve."", ""We're also encouraged by the growth and margin prospects from our continued focus on services related to higher skilled talent, both in talent solutions and Protiviti. Our investments in higher skilled services carry many advantages, higher bill rates and gross margins, longer assignment links, increased client openness to remote tell, more full time engagement professionals and less economic sensitivity. This investment has already provided significant benefit in the current cycle as our cumulative sequential revenue declines during the last six quarters are about half of what they were compared to peak to trough declines of the dot-com and financial crisis downturns. We expect this positive mix shift to continue. We continue to invest in technology and innovation, including AI."", ""Major focus areas include providing a world class digital experience for our clients and candidates that is seamlessly connected to our specialized professional recruiters. Also, we continue to leverage our proprietary data assets to enhance the AI tools our recruiters use to discover, assess and select talent for our clients and the AI tools our recruiters use to effectively target leads for additional revenue. We're pleased with Protiviti's results for the quarter led again by the regulatory risk and compliance practice. Other solutions areas were again modestly impacted by client budget measures. Protiviti's pipeline continues to grow, although, economic conditions continue to impact the average deal size and the time it takes to close contracts and begin new engagements."", ""Protiviti continues to compete very effectively in the marketplace, benefiting from its focused and nimble solutions offerings and its differentiated breadth and depth of resources, including priority access to scalable contract talent at all skill levels through our talent solutions practices. Protiviti now represents 34% of our annual segment income, which is expected to increase as it expands its small but growing market share in the growing global consulting industry. We've weathered many economic cycles in the past, each time emerging to achieve higher peaks, aging workforce demographics and clients' desire for flexible resources and variable costs are structural tailwinds that are expected to continue for many years to come. We began the new year energized by our time tested corporate for purpose to connect people to meaningful and exciting work and provide clients with the talent and consulting expertise they need to confidently compete and grow."", ""We'd also like to thank our people across the globe whose commitment to success made possible a number of new accolades in 2023. Fourth quarter recognition included being named one of the best workplaces for parents by Great Places to Work, on America's most responsible companies by Newsweek and Best Managed Company of 2023 by The Wall Street Journal.

I will now turn the call over to John.', ""John Stauch: Thank you, Shelley, and good morning, everyone. Our record performance in 2023 demonstrates the power of our balanced water portfolio and our focused growth strategy post the separation of nVent. We completed year one with our three-segment structure, Flow, Water Solutions, and Pool, and we finished our first full year with Manitowoc Ice. Our Flow segment, which moves water where it's needed and removes water where it's not wanted, along with our Water Solutions segment, which improves water, both posted a record year for sales and ROS; and our Pool segment, which enables people to enjoy water, delivered record ROS despite significant volume headwinds. I'm extremely proud of our approximately 10,500 global employees for their solid execution in a challenging macroeconomic environment."", ""As we enter 2024, we are leveraging our balanced portfolio for continued growth and profitability with expectations for new records of financial performance. Additionally, we look forward to sharing more about our strategy and three-year outlook at our Investor Day on March 6th. Now, let's begin with our Executive Summary, Q4 2023 on Slide 8. We finished Q4 with record performance in a fourth quarter post the separation of nVent in 2018, specifically record segment income and ROS, marking the seventh consecutive quarter of ROS expansion. This is important to note with strong comparables in Q4 2022. In the fourth quarter, sales were down 2%, which included slightly better than expected Pool performance. Segment income increased 8% and ROS expanded by 190 basis points."", ""Adjusted EPS was $0.87, up 6%, and we generated $97 million of free cash flow in the quarter. Let's move to Slide 9, titled Executive Summary Full Year ’23. 2023 was a record year for segment income, ROS, and adjusted EPS, post the nVent separation, as previously mentioned, despite sales ending the year flat. In full year ’23, we delivered sales of $4.1 billion; record segment income of $855 million, up 11%; record annual ROS of 20.8%, expanding 220 basis points; and record adjusted EPS of $3.75. Flow and Water Solutions set new sales records in 2023, and we delivered significant margin expansion across all three segments, setting a new annual record ROS for each. Transformation and solid execution across all three segments continue to drive operational efficiencies throughout the year."", ""Lastly, we generated significant free cash flow of $550 million and increased our dividend for the 48th consecutive year, further solidifying our status as a dividend aristocrat. Let's turn to Slide 10, titled Balanced Water Portfolio. We are helping the world sustainably move, improve, and enjoy water through our three segments, each with over $1 billion in sales in 2023, and together creating a balanced water portfolio. Our strategy is working, and we have been delivering on the expectations that we have shared with you. I will now pass the call over to Bob, who will discuss our performance and financial results in more detail. Bob?"", ""Bob Fishman: Thank you, John, and good morning, everyone. Let's start on Slide 11, titled Q4 2023 Pentair Performance. I will also be discussing our Full Year Performance on Slide 12. We delivered another strong quarter of earnings and significant margin expansion, despite sales being down 2% year-over-year. Volume continued to improve sequentially, with substantial progress in Q4 as compared to Q2 and Q3, driven primarily by improvement in Pool volume. Sales for Q4 were down 2%, which was slightly better than we guided. Core sales across all three segments were down slightly, as compared to last year's record Q4, when our lead times began to improve from a recovering global supply chain, enabling us to ship more backlog orders."", 'As we move into 2024, we expect to see a more normalized operating environment. Fourth quarter segment income increased 8% to $198 million, and return on sales expanded 190 basis points year-over-year to 20.1%. This improvement was driven primarily by our Transformation initiatives. Adjusted EPS of $0.87 was up 6% versus the prior year. For the full year, sales were flat at $4.1 billion, with core sales down 5%, driven by growth in Flow and Water Solutions, which were offset by lower Pool volumes. Segment income grew 11% and return on sales expanded 220 basis points to a record 20.8%. All three segments significantly expanded margins and set new records. Adjusted EPS increased to a record $3.75. Turning to Slide 13, labeled Flow at a Glance, you can see the impressive five-year financial performance.', 'Sales rose over 4% compounded annually and margin expanded 300 basis points since 2019. In 2023, Flow continued to reach new records in sales and ROS. We have also provided a sales view by region, channel and solution reflecting 2023 sales and the diversified nature of the business. We have eight iconic brands, some over 100 years old, and we rank first in quality, technical support and customer service. Please turn to Slide 14, labeled Q4 2023 Flow Performance. In addition to the fourth quarter performance for Flow, I will also be referencing the full year performance on Slide 15. Note that we have recently renamed our Industrial & Flow Technologies segment to Flow. In Q4, Flow grew sales 1% in the quarter to $379 million, a record fourth quarter.', 'Industrial solutions was up 9% and commercial was up 2% with residential down 7%. Segment income was flat and return on sales decreased 20 basis points to 17.2% due to a return to more normal seasonality following a record Q4 2022 and an unfavorable mix from our residential business. For the year, Flow sales increased 5% to $1.58 billion primarily due to double digit growth in commercial and industrial solutions. Residential was down 4% showing improvement sequentially from Q3. Full year segment income grew 17% and return on sales increased 170 basis points to 17.8%, a record margin for Flow driven by Transformation and price more than offsetting inflation. Turning to Slide 16, titled Water Solutions at a Glance, you can see the strong five year financial record with a compounded annual sales growth rate of 17% and over 400 basis points margin expansion since 2019.', 'Our iconic brands include Everpure and Manitowoc Ice. Our residential Water Solutions products have helped reduce the need for 7 billion single use water bottles in 2023. Please turn to Slide 17, labeled Q4 2023 Water Solutions Performance. In addition to the fourth quarter performance for Water Solutions, I will also be referencing the full year performance on Slide 18. In Q4, Water Solution sales decreased 5% to $270 million following a record Q4 2022. Commercial sales were down 4% primarily due to the timing of projects within our services business, partially offset by growth in Manitowoc Ice and filtration. In residential, Q4 sales were down 6% but reflect significant improvements sequentially from Q3 of this year in which residential sales were down 14%.', 'Segment income grew 15% to $52 million and return on sales expanded 320 basis points to 19.1%, a new Q4 record driven primarily by productivity from our Transformation initiatives and Manitowoc Ice. For the year, Water Solution sales grew 19%. Segment income grew 66% and return on sales increased 590 basis points to 21%, a new full year record. Commercial sales increased 54% driven by the acquisition of Manitowoc Ice and growth in filtration. Manitowoc Ice had a record sales year with growth of 23% versus the prior year. Please turn to slide S9 titled Pool at a Glance. Looking at the five-year financial performance, Pool was able to grow the top-line significantly and increase margins to a record 31% or up 320 basis points since 2019. Our Pool business benefits from a very large installed base with roughly 80% of sales coming from remodel and break and fix.', ""Please turn to Slide 20 labeled Q4 2023 Pool Performance. In addition to the fourth quarter performance for Pool, I'll also be referencing the full year performance on Slide 21. In Q4, Pool sales declined 2% to $336 million driven by a six-point drop in volume which was partially offset by four points of price. Note that volume improved significantly compared to the 28-point decline in Pool volume in Q3. For the year, Pool sales were down 18%, segment income decreased 10%, and return on sales increased 270 basis points to 31% driven by price and our Transformation initiatives. Please turn to Slide 22 labeled Transformation Initiatives. Similar to last quarter, we believe this slide provides a good illustration of our Transformation initiatives and our ultimate goal of driving margin expansion."", 'We have been targeting ROS of approximately 23% by the end of fiscal 2025, expanding margins over 400 basis points as compared to fiscal 2022. In 2023, we delivered ROS of 20.8% as Transformation began to read out in Q3 and Q4, and we expect to deliver roughly 22% by the end of full year ’24, which we believe puts us on track with our Transformation initiatives. Please turn to Slide 23 labeled Transformation Runway. We have kept this slide as a reference to illustrate the staggered nature of each of the four initiatives and the various stages of each. We are pleased to note that we believe we are executing well on these initiatives going into 2024. Please turn to Slide 24 labeled Balance Sheet and Cash Flow. In Q4, we generated $97 million in free cash flow, up nearly 100% year-over-year, reflecting another strong quarter.', 'For the year, our free cash flow was $550 million, up nearly 94% year-over-year. Our net debt leverage ratio was 2.0 times, down from 2.6 times in Q1. Our total debt was less than $2 billion, and the average interest rate was approximately 5.2%. Our ROIC was 14.3%, which includes the full impact from the Manitowoc Ice acquisition. With the focus on being good stewards of capital, we continue to target high teens ROIC. We plan to remain disciplined with our capital and continue to focus on debt reduction amid the higher interest rate environment with the potential for share buybacks. Moving to Slide 15 titled Q1 and Full Year 2024 Pentair Outlook. For the full year, we are introducing our adjusted EPS guidance of approximately $4.15 to $4.25, which represents a year-over-year range of up 11% to up 13%.', 'We expect total Pentair sales in fiscal 2024 to be approximately $4.2 billion or up about 2% to 3%. We expect Flow sales to be up low-single digits reflecting low to mid-single digit growth in our commercial and industrial businesses offset slightly by a low-single digit decline in residential. Water Solution sales are expected to be essentially flat, comping record 2023 performance driven by our commercial water business. Commercial sales in full year 2024 are expected to be up low-single digits and residential to be down low to mid-single digits. Pool sales are expected to increase approximately 7% in full year 2024 which aligns the historical compound annual growth rates of mid-single digits pre-pandemic. We expect Pool sales to increase driven primarily by inventory headwinds in 2023 that we do not expect to repeat in 2024 and some benefit of price.', 'We expect this growth to be slightly offset by the uncertainty that still exists regarding the macroeconomic environment, higher interest rates, the potential impact of financing for new and remodeled pools and potential repair deferrals in the aftermarket. We believe Pool remains a highly attractive market for us and we look to deliver strong growth in 2024 while being mindful of macroeconomic dynamics. We expect segment income to increase approximately 10% with ROS expansion of roughly 150 basis points. Also for the full year we expect corporate expense of approximately $95 million, net interest expense of roughly $100 million, an adjusted tax rate of approximately 16.5% which is inclusive of changes in the global tax standards for a total impact to Pentair of about $0.07 per share and a share count of approximately 166 million to 167 million.', 'Lastly, we expect to deliver approximately $1 billion in EBITDA in full year 2024, a milestone we are very proud of. For the first quarter, we expect sales to be down approximately 2% to 3%. As a reminder, many of our businesses were working down large backlogs in Q1 last year as supply chains improved and we were able to ship more backlog orders, in 2024 we expect more normalized seasonality in our businesses. We expect first quarter segment income to be flat to down 3% primarily due to lower sales with corporate expense of approximately $25 million, net interest expense of roughly $29 million, an adjusted tax rate of approximately 16.5% and a share count of approximately 167 million. We expect Q1 to drive ROS expansion both sequentially and year-on-year.', 'We are also introducing adjusted EPS guidance for the first quarter of approximately $0.88 to $0.91. For the first time since 2020, we believe we are seeing a return to a more normalized operating environment globally. Thus we expect to see seasonality resume to historical norms across all three of our segments in 2024 with Transformation driving margin expansion. In the first half of 2024 we expect adjusted EPS to be slightly less than 50% of our full year adjusted EPS guide. Q1 is expected to be the lowest quarter for sales, segment income, ROS and adjusted EPS as compared to the remaining three quarters in full year ’24. We have continued to accelerate transformation funnels and remain focused on investing in the long-term growth of our company.', 'Turning to Slide 16 titled 2023 Reflection, our business continued to execute well and delivered what we said we would do. We drove margins as a result of our balanced water portfolio and Transformation initiatives. Manitowoc Ice posted a record year exceeding expectations. We drove performance accountability across the organization, ended the year with an even stronger balance sheet and free cash flow and maintained a disciplined capital allocation strategy. We believe we are well positioned going into full year ’24. I would now like to turn the call over to the operator for Q&A, after which John will have a few closing remarks. Drew, please open the line for questions. Thank you.', 'See also 25 Most Cannabis Consuming-Countries in the World and 11 Best Wine Stocks to Buy Now.', 'To continue reading the Q&A session, please click here.']"

Within Cardiology, Interventional Cardiology Therapies sales grew 10% for the full year and -- for the fourth quarter and full year. On a full-year basis, the Coronary Therapies franchise growth was driven by strong performance in our international regions and our Imaging franchise globally. AGENT Drug-Coated Balloon continues to perform very well in Japan. We now expect approval of AGENT in the US in the first half of 2024. AGENT DCB will be the first coronary drug-eluting balloon in the US indicated for in-stent restenosis, providing physicians and their patients a solution for this unmet clinical need.', 'Our Structural Heart Valves franchise grew double-digits in both fourth quarter and in a full year basis, led by the performance of ACURATE Neo2 in Europe. And we now have treated more than 70,000 patients to date with our ACURATE technology globally. As we look ahead, we anticipate approval of ACURATE Prime in Europe in 2025. However, after reviewing a planned interim analysis of the US ACURATE IDE data, we will now wait for the full one-year data from the RCT cohort of 100 patients to determine our regulatory strategy. Therefore, we no longer anticipate the approval of ACURATE Prime in the US in 2024.

We have now treated over 400,000 patients globally with the WATCHMAN technology. US Q4 growth of 23% was supported by the breadth of the portfolio and the initial launch of WATCHMAN FLX Pro, which we expect to move into full launch in the first quarter.

On a full year basis, our Diagnostics franchise grew double-digits outpacing market growth, driven by broad portfolio and ongoing investments in innovation. In Core CRM, in both fourth quarter and on a full year basis, our high-voltage business grew low-single digits and our low-voltage business grew mid-single-digits. 2023 performance was driven by our differentiated high-voltage portfolio and shock polarity options.

US fourth quarter sales grew 40% organically, driven by our POLARx launch and ongoing momentum with our Access Solutions portfolio. Our international EP growth accelerated in the fourth quarter, growing 46% organically, fueled by improved FARAPULSE console supply. We now treated over 40,000 patients globally with the FARAPULSE technology to-date.

We continue to invest in ClinicalEVIDENCE to study new indications and support access to our FARAPULSE technology."", ""Late last year, we initiated the AVANT GUARD trial to evaluate the safety and efficacy of the system. It's a first-line treatment for Persistent AF compared to antiarrhythmic drug therapy. Additionally, real-world data was presented at AHA for more than 17,000 patients treated with the FARAPULSE from the MANIFEST-17K registry, which reinforced the real-world safety profile of the FARAPULSE platform with no reports of permanent phrenic nerve palsy or pulmonary vein stenosis or esophageal injury and an overall major adverse rate event rate of less than 1%. We're excited to bring this innovative technology to more markets and expect approval of FARAPULSE in Japan -- China and Japan likely in the second half of this year.

Sales from closed acquisitions and divestitures contributed 90 basis points resulting in 13.6% organic revenue growth, exceeding our guidance range of 8% to 10%. Q4 2023 adjusted earnings per share of $0.55 grew 24% versus 2022, exceeding the high-end of our guidance range of $0.49 to $0.52, primarily driven by our strong sales performance.

Fourth quarter adjusted operating margin was 26.6%, resulting in a full year 2023 adjusted operating margin of 26.3%, improving 70 basis points versus 2022. We expect to expand adjusted operating margin in 2024 by another 30 basis points to 50 basis points, balancing progress towards our long-range plan goal of 150 basis points over the three years, 2024 to 2026, with flexibility for critical investments to support key launches.

Fully diluted weighted average shares outstanding ended at 1,477 million shares in Q4 and 1,464 million shares for full year 2023. Free cash flow for the quarter was $718 million with $984 million of operating activities, less $267 million of net capital expenditures.

We expect to fund the Axonics acquisition through a mix of cash on hand and new debt, which will be determined prior to or at the time of close. Our top capital allocation priority remains strategic tuck-in M&A, followed by annual share repurchases to offset dilution from employee stock grants.

We continue to monitor tax legislation globally, including the currently drafted law to partially repeal US R&D capitalization. If the law were to be passed as currently proposed, we would expect a tailwind of approximately 100 basis points to our operational tax rate in 2024. We expect full year adjusted earnings per share to be in a range of $2.23 to $2.27, representing 9% to 11% growth versus 2023, including an approximate $0.04 headwind from foreign exchange at current rates and existing hedging contracts, which will be recognized ratably through the year.', ""We expect first quarter adjusted earnings per share to be in a range of $0.50 to $0.52.

The reason can be seen in the Oracle of Omaha's returns since taking the reins in the mid-1960s."", ""The broad-based S&P 500 took until last year to top a cumulative 30,000% total return, including dividends. However, since Buffett became CEO of Berkshire Hathaway, the Oracle of Omaha has overseen a greater than 4,700,000% aggregate return in his company's Class A shares (BRK.A) in under six decades (as of the close on Jan. 26, 2024). Returns like this are bound to draw a following from both professional and everyday investors."", ""The great thing about Warren Buffett and the $371 billion investment portfolio he oversees at Berkshire Hathaway is the transparency involved. Thanks to quarterly filed Form 13Fs with the Securities and Exchange Commission, investors have been able to effectively mirror Buffett's trading activity for decades."", ""The other noteworthy aspect of Berkshire's $371 billion portfolio is that it's packed with profitable, time-tested companies. In other words, it's a stomping ground for top-notch investment ideas."", 'As we power into the shortest month of the year, three Warren Buffett stocks stand out as screaming buys.', ""The first Buffett stock that's begging to be bought in February is satellite-radio operator Sirius XM Holdings (NASDAQ: SIRI). Berkshire's portfolio added more shares of Sirius XM during the third quarter after a roughly two-year absence."", ""The biggest concern for radio companies is the health of the advertising market. Ad spending is highly cyclical, and businesses aren't shy about paring back their ad budgets when the first signs of trouble become apparent. With a couple of predictive indicators and money-based metrics offering ominous warnings for the U.S. economy, there's the potential for a challenging year."", ""On the other hand, Sirius XM Holdings is built differently than terrestrial and online radio operators, which gives the company a number of distinct competitive advantages in virtually any economic climate. To start with the most obvious difference, Sirius XM is the only legally authorized satellite-radio operator. Though this doesn't mean it's absolved from competition, it affords the company superior pricing power with its subscription services."", ""I'd argue that the most important differentiator between Sirius XM and traditional operators is how they generate revenue. Terrestrial and online-radio companies rely very heavily on advertising revenue. Meanwhile, Sirius XM generated only 19.2% of its net sales from advertising through the first nine months of 2023 -- virtually all of which can be traced back to Pandora, which it purchased in February 2019. Subscriptions accounted for the bulk (77.2%) of its net sales."", ""As noted, businesses will quickly pare back their ad budgets at the first hint of economic disruption. But this isn't the case with Sirius XM's subscribers, who are far less likely to cancel their services than advertisers are to reduce their budgets. During economic downturns, Sirius XM would be in far better shape than its peers."", ""Another quick point is that some of Sirius XM's expenses are highly predictable. Although royalty and talent acquisition costs vary from one quarter to the next, transmission and equipment costs are effectively stable. The company can continue adding subscribers without increasing these core expenses."", ""Lastly, Sirius XM's forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 17 is at a decade low and represents about a 20% discount to its five-year average."", 'A second Warren Buffett stock that\'s a screaming buy in February (and beyond) is banking giant Bank of America (NYSE: BAC). ""BofA,"" as the bank is more commonly known, is Berkshire Hathaway\'s second-largest holding by market value.', ""The knock against bank stocks is that they're cyclical. They're going to ebb and flow with the health of the U.S. economy. If forecasts about a recession prove accurate in 2024, bank stocks like BofA would be expected to see an increase in loan losses and credit delinquencies."", ""If I can offer a bit of solace, it's that the economic boom-bust cycle is disproportionate. While recessions are a normal and inevitable part of the economic cycle, they're not long-lasting."", 'Only three of the 12 recessions since the end of World War II stuck around for at least 12 months, while none of the remaining three surpassed 18 months. Comparatively, two periods of expansion reached the decade mark over the past 78 years.

By way of learning-by-doing, we'll look at ROE to gain a better understanding of Waste Management, Inc.

Put another way, it reveals the company's success at turning shareholder investments into profits."", ' See our latest analysis for Waste Management ', 'ROE can be calculated by using the formula:', ""Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' Equity"", 'So, based on the above formula, the ROE for Waste Management is:', '33% = US$2.3b ÷ US$7.0b (Based on the trailing twelve months to September 2023).', ""The 'return' is the income the business earned over the last year. So, this means that for every $1 of its shareholder's investments, the company generates a profit of $0.33."", 'One simple way to determine if a company has a good return on equity is to compare it to the average for its industry. The limitation of this approach is that some companies are quite different from others, even within the same industry classification. As is clear from the image below, Waste Management has a better ROE than the average (10%) in the Commercial Services industry.', ""That's what we like to see. With that said, a high ROE doesn't always indicate high profitability. Aside from changes in net income, a high ROE can also be the outcome of high debt relative to equity, which indicates risk. To know the 2 risks we have identified for Waste Management visit our risks dashboard for free."", 'Most companies need money -- from somewhere -- to grow their profits. That cash can come from issuing shares, retained earnings, or debt. In the first and second cases, the ROE will reflect this use of cash for investment in the business. In the latter case, the use of debt will improve the returns, but will not change the equity. In this manner the use of debt will boost ROE, even though the core economics of the business stay the same.', ""Waste Management clearly uses a high amount of debt to boost returns, as it has a debt to equity ratio of 2.12. There's no doubt the ROE is impressive, but it's worth keeping in mind that the metric could have been lower if the company were to reduce its debt. Investors should think carefully about how a company might perform if it was unable to borrow so easily, because credit markets do change over time."", 'Return on equity is one way we can compare its business quality of different companies. Companies that can achieve high returns on equity without too much debt are generally of good quality. If two companies have the same ROE, then I would generally prefer the one with less debt.', 'But ROE is just one piece of a bigger puzzle, since high quality businesses often trade on high multiples of earnings. The rate at which profits are likely to grow, relative to the expectations of profit growth reflected in the current price, must be considered, too.

Stryker reported in line with analyst predictions, delivering revenues of US$20b and statutory earnings per share of US$8.25, suggesting the business is executing well and in line with its plan. The analysts typically update their forecasts at each earnings report, and we can judge from their estimates whether their view of the company has changed or if there are any new concerns to be aware of. We've gathered the most recent statutory forecasts to see whether the analysts have changed their earnings models, following these results."", ' View our latest analysis for Stryker ', ""Taking into account the latest results, the current consensus from Stryker's 28 analysts is for revenues of US$22.1b in 2024. This would reflect a satisfactory 7.6% increase on its revenue over the past 12 months. Per-share earnings are expected to swell 17% to US$9.76. In the lead-up to this report, the analysts had been modelling revenues of US$21.8b and earnings per share (EPS) of US$9.79 in 2024. The consensus analysts don't seem to have seen anything in these results that would have changed their view on the business, given there's been no major change to their estimates."", ""The consensus price target rose 7.7% to US$350despite there being no meaningful change to earnings estimates. It could be that the analystsare reflecting the predictability of Stryker's earnings by assigning a price premium. It could also be instructive to look at the range of analyst estimates, to evaluate how different the outlier opinions are from the mean. There are some variant perceptions on Stryker, with the most bullish analyst valuing it at US$390 and the most bearish at US$242 per share. There are definitely some different views on the stock, but the range of estimates is not wide enough as to imply that the situation is unforecastable, in our view."", ""Of course, another way to look at these forecasts is to place them into context against the industry itself. The period to the end of 2024 brings more of the same, according to the analysts, with revenue forecast to display 7.6% growth on an annualised basis. That is in line with its 8.4% annual growth over the past five years. Juxtapose this against our data, which suggests that other companies (with analyst coverage) in the industry are forecast to see their revenues grow 8.0% per year. So although Stryker is expected to maintain its revenue growth rate, it's only growing at about the rate of the wider industry."", ""The most important thing to take away is that there's been no major change in sentiment, with the analysts reconfirming that the business is performing in line with their previous earnings per share estimates. Happily, there were no real changes to revenue forecasts, with the business still expected to grow in line with the overall industry. There was also a nice increase in the price target, with the analysts clearly feeling that the intrinsic value of the business is improving."", 'Keeping that in mind, we still think that the longer term trajectory of the business is much more important for investors to consider.

My name is Luke, and I'll be your operator for today's call. At this time all participants are in a listen-only mode. Following the conference, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. This conference call is being recorded for replay purposes. Before we begin, I'd like to remind you that discussions during this conference call will include forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially are discussed in the company's most recent filings with the SEC. Also, the discussions will include certain non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures can be found in today's press release that is an exhibit to Stryker's current report on Form 8-K filed today with the SEC. I'd now like to turn the call over to Mr. Kevin Lobo, Chair and Chief Executive Officer. You may proceed, sir."", ""Kevin Lobo: Welcome to Stryker's fourth quarter earnings call. Joining me today are Glenn Boehnlein, Stryker's CFO; and Jason Beach, Vice President of Investor Relations. For today's call, I'll provide opening comments, followed by Jason with the trends we saw during the quarter, MAKO performance insights and updates on recent acquisitions. Glenn will then provide additional details regarding our quarterly results and 2024 guidance before opening the call to Q&A. First, I want to recognize and celebrate our achievement of surpassing $20 billion in sales. We continue to be a high-growth company with a focus on our mission to deliver for our patients and customers. As we begin 2024, I am very excited about our future. We are in a strong position with robust demand across both procedures and capital, easing macro constraints and a strong pipeline of innovation."", ""I want to thank our over 50,000 employees for their unrelenting determination, agility and performance. We've delivered terrific sales growth of over 11% in Q4 and the full year despite strong comparatives from the prior year. Our commercial execution, including many successful product introductions was excellent across our businesses and regions. Globally, for both Q4 and the full year, we had double-digit organic sales growth in instruments, endoscopy, medical, neuro cranial, hips, knees and trauma and extremities. For the full year, we also had double-digit organic sales growth both in the U.S. and internationally. Spine and neurovascular also demonstrated good performances while making notable advancements in future innovations and acquisitions."", 'It was a comprehensive performance across our businesses, and we have built significant momentum entering 2024. For the sixth straight year, our international sales growth, excluding China VBP outpaced our strong U.S. business. Canada, Australia and most emerging markets had double-digit growth, while Europe and Japan grew in high single digits. International continues to be a large growth opportunity for us. Next, we delivered quarterly and full year adjusted EPS of $3.46 and $10.60, respectively, which represents 15% growth for Q4 and 13% growth compared to the full year of 2022. This was driven by our strong sales, but also demonstrates our continued operating margin recovery. We remain focused on driving high growth now and in the future through investments in organic innovation and M&A.', 'We expect to continue to deliver sales growth at the high end of medtech, which is reflected in our full year 2024 guidance of organic sales growth of 7.5% to 9%. This growth, combined with an accelerated margin expansion plan, translates to an adjusted EPS of $11.70 to $12 per share. I will now turn the call over to Jason.', 'Jason Beach: Thanks, Kevin. My comments today will focus on providing an update on the current environment as well as MAKO, Vocera and our recently announced agreement to acquire SERF. During the quarter, we saw strong procedural demand. We continue to expect the ortho markets will remain strong in 2024, driven by continued adoption in robotic-assisted surgery, demographics, a more favorable pricing environment and healthy patient activity levels with surgeons. While supply constraints continue in pockets around the globe, our supply is stable overall and gradually improving. Additionally, demand for our capital products remained very robust in the quarter with double-digit organic growth in medical, instruments and endoscopy.', 'Hospital CapEx budgets remain healthy, and our capital order book remains elevated as we enter 2024. Next, specific to MAKO, we had a record quarter of installations globally. The progress of our MAKO offense, including our recent direct-to-consumer campaign, has resulted in strong growth of our installed base alongside continued increases in utilization. In the U.S., we saw 60% of knees and 34% of hips performed using MAKO as we exited the year. Globally, we exited the year with just over 40% of knees and nearing 20% of hips performed using MAKO. We have momentum, and a significant opportunity remains as MAKO adoption increases. We are nearing the two-year anniversary of our Vocera acquisition and remain very excited about the acquired assets, as it provides a platform for us to be at the intersection of medical devices, software and clinical support.', 'With integration activities now complete, which included a migration towards the cloud as well as the commercial reorganization, we are pleased with the accelerating double-digit sales and order growth achieved as we exited the year. In 2023, we saw many cross-sell wins, including new bed business leveraging Vocera. Also, we completed the seamless experience created between the Vocera platform and both ProCuity and our new wireless structure. This year and beyond will bring even more integrations and enhancements with a focus on scalability, user experience, automated workflow and documentation. We expect strong double-digit annual sales growth to continue for years to come, and we are excited to have Vocera as part of the Stryker family. Lastly, we are progressing with our recently announced agreement to acquire SERF, and we expect the deal will close this quarter.', 'With that, I will now turn the call over to Glenn.', ""Glenn Boehnlein: Thanks, Jason. Today, I will focus my comments on our fourth quarter financial results and the related drivers. Our detailed financial results have been provided in today's press release. Our organic sales growth was 11.4% in the quarter, compared to 13.2% organic growth in the fourth quarter of 2022. The fourth quarter of 2023 has the same number of selling days as 2022. The impact from pricing in the quarter was favorable by 0.7%. We continue to see a positive trend from our pricing initiatives, particularly in our MedSurg and Neurotech businesses, all of which contributed positive pricing for the quarter. Foreign currency had a 0.3% favorable impact on sales in the quarter. In the quarter, U.S. organic sales growth was 12.7%."", 'International organic sales growth was 7.7%, against a very strong comparable of over 18% in 2022. This performance included positive sales momentum across most of our international markets, particularly Australia, Canada, Japan and most emerging markets. For the year, organic sales growth was 11.5%, with U.S. organic sales growth of 11.7% and international organic sales growth of 10.9%. Excluding the impact of China VBP, international growth was 12.8%. The impact for pricing in the year was favorable 0.6%. Foreign currency had a 0.5% unfavorable impact, and 2023 as the same number of selling days as 2022. Our adjusted EPS of $3.46 in the quarter was up 15.3% from 2022, driven by higher sales and operating margin expansion, as well as lower other income and expenses.', 'Foreign currency exchange translation had a favorable impact of $0.02. Our full year adjusted EPS was $10.60, which represents growth of 13.5% from full year 2022, reflecting the favorable impact of sales growth and operating margin expansion, partially offset by the unfavorable impact of foreign currency exchange translation of $0.10. Now I will provide some highlights around our quarterly segment performance. In the quarter, MedSurg and Neurotechnology had constant currency sales growth of 12% and organic sales growth of 11.8%, which included 13.8% of U.S. organic growth and 5.7% of international growth. Instruments had U.S. organic sales growth of 11.5%, with strong double-digit growth across its Surgical Technology and Orthopedic Instruments businesses.', 'From a product perspective, sales growth was led by power tools, SteriShield, smoke evacuation and surg account. Endoscopy had U.S. organic sales growth of 17.9%, with double-digit growth in its Communications, Endo, BEU and Sports Medicine businesses. From a product perspective, this includes strong growth in booms, lights and video. During the quarter, the Endoscopy business continued to see very strong momentum of the 1788 camera system, which had its full launch in September. Medical had U.S. organic sales growth of 12.9%, led by performances in its Vocera, Acute Care and Sage businesses. This included strong growth in Vocera badges, beds, stretchers and Prevalon repositioning products. All of this was against a very strong comparable growth of over 20% in 2022.', 'Neurovascular had U.S. organic sales growth of 7.6%, reflecting solid performance in our hemorrhagic business. Neurocranial had U.S. organic sales growth of 14%, which included double-digit growth in the neurosurgical and ENT businesses, with strong growth in high-speed drill and balloon dilation products. Internationally, MedSurg and Neurotechnology had organic sales growth of 5.7%, reflecting double-digit growth in our instruments and neurocranial businesses. Geographically, this included strong performances in Australia, Canada and Japan. Orthopedics and Spine had constant currency and organic sales growth of 10.7%, which included organic growth of 10.9% in the U.S. and 10.1% internationally. Our U.S. Knee business grew 12.9% organically, which reflects our market-leading position in robotic-assisted knee procedures.', 'Our U.S. Hip business also grew 12.9% organically, reflecting solid primary hip growth fueled by our Insignia Hip Stem. Our U.S. Trauma and Extremities business grew 12.1% organically, with strong performances across all of its businesses, including Upper Extremities, Biologics, Core Trauma, and Foot and Ankle. Our U.S. Spine business grew 6%, led by the performance in our Enabling Technology and Interventional Spine businesses. Internationally, Orthopedics and Spine grew 10.1% organically, including strong performances in Canada and most emerging markets, particularly driven by Mako and strong Knee performance across most geographies. Now I will focus on operating highlights in the fourth quarter. Our adjusted gross margin of 63.9% was favorably – was favorable approximately 120 basis points from the fourth quarter of 2022.', 'This improvement was primarily driven by the continued easing of certain cost pressures, including the elimination of spot buy purchases that we experienced in 2022, and the continued benefit of pricing initiatives. Adjusted R&D spending was 5.6% of sales, which was 10 basis points higher than the fourth quarter of 2022. Our adjusted SG&A was 31% of sales, which was 40 basis points higher than the fourth quarter of 2022 due to continued investments, including sales growth incentives and a more normalized cadence of travel and meetings. In summary, for the fourth quarter, our adjusted operating margin was 27.2% of sales, which was approximately 60 basis points favorable to the fourth quarter of 2022. For the full year, our adjusted operating margin was 24.2% of sales, a 40 basis points increase over 2022.', 'This performance is mainly driven by the easing of certain gross margin cost pressures throughout the second half of the year as well as the positive impact of our pricing actions. Adjusted other income and expense of $31 million for the quarter was $23 million lower than 2022, mainly driven by higher interest income and other favorable discrete items. For 2024, we expect our full year other income and expense to be approximately $250 million. Our fourth quarter and full year had an adjusted effective tax rate of 14.6% and 14.1%, respectively, reflecting the impact of geographic mix and certain discrete tax items. For 2024, we expect our full year effective tax rate to be in the range of 14% to 15%. Focusing on the balance sheet, we ended the year with $3 billion of cash and marketable securities and total debt of $13 billion.', 'During the year, we paid down the remaining $850 million outstanding on the $1.5 billion term loan associated with the Vocera acquisition and achieved our deleveraging commitments. In Q4, we also refinanced certain debt maturities, including prefunding of $600 million that is due in May 2024. Turning to cash flow, our year-to-date cash from operations was $3.7 billion. This performance reflects the results of net earnings and higher accounts receivable collections. For 2024, we anticipate that capital spending will be $650 million to $700 million. We do not anticipate any share buybacks. And now I will provide 2024 full year sales and earnings guidance. Based on our momentum from 2023, strong procedural volumes, healthy demand for capital products and a stabilizing macroeconomic environment, we expect organic sales growth to be in the range of 7.5% to 9% for 2024.', 'There is one additional selling day in 2024 compared to 2023, with one less day in Q1 and one more day in both Q3 and Q4. Based on the steady progress of our pricing actions, we would expect the full year impact of price to be roughly flat. If foreign exchange rates hold near current levels, we anticipate sales will be modestly, unfavorably impacted for the full year, being more negative in the first half of the year. EPS will be negatively impacted $0.05 to $0.10. This is included in our guidance. Finally, for the full year 2024, we expect adjusted net earnings per diluted share to be in the range of $11.70 to $12, representing our commitment to accelerated operating margin expansion in 2024 as well as the stabilized – stabilizing operating environment.', 'While we do not provide quarterly guidance, we do expect seasonality for sales and related earnings to be similar to 2023, but adjusted for the quarterly differences in 2024 selling days. And now I will open up the call for Q&A.', 'See also 15 Countries that Produce the Best Software Engineers and 15 Highest Quality Bottled Water Brands in The US.', 'To continue reading the Q&A session, please click here.']"

Today's call is being recorded. Joining me today are Marc Bitzer, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Jim Peters, our Chief Financial Officer. Our remarks today track with a presentation available in the Investors section of our website at whirlpoolcorp.com. Before we begin, I want to remind you that as we conduct this call, we'll be making forward-looking statements to assist you in better understanding Whirlpool Corporation's future expectations. Our actual results could differ materially from these statements due to many factors discussed in our latest 10-K, 10-Q, and other periodic reports. We also want to remind you that today's presentation includes non-GAAP measures, outlined in further detail at the beginning of our earnings presentation."", ""We believe these measures are important indicators of our operations as they exclude items that may not be indicative of our results from our ongoing business operations. We also think the adjusted measures will provide you with a better baseline for analyzing trends in our ongoing business operations. Listeners are directed to the supplemental information package posted on the Investor Relations section of our website for the reconciliation of non-GAAP items to the most directly comparable GAAP measures. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Following our prepared remarks, the call will be opened for analyst questions. As a reminder, we ask that participants ask no more than two questions. With that, I'll turn the call over to Marc."", ""Marc Bitzer: Thanks, Korey, and good morning, everyone. Today marks our first earnings call in the new year, and I do appreciate that everyone's attention will be on our perspective for 2024. However, I want to take the opportunity to reflect and look back at last year. During this past year, there have been a number of achievements we're proud of. One, we gained more than 1 point of market share in North America. This is a clear testimony of the success of our great products and brands in the marketplace. Two, we were able to reduce our net cost base by $800 million, which is what we had in mind when we started the year. And three, the signing of our EMEA transaction with Arçelik marked a major milestone in our portfolio transformation and is expected to provide significant opportunities to unlock value."", 'At the same time, there are a number of areas where we fell short of our own expectations. The promotional environment, which reversed back earlier than anticipated to a pre-COVID intensity, put pressure on our EBIT margins. And while our full year EBIT margin of 6.1% is solid, it is still more than 1 point short of where we want it to be. And we were not able to reduce our inventories fast enough, which negatively impacted our full year cash flow. Obviously, these results were impacted by a still unfavorable housing cycle in 2023. The rapid and steep increase of US mortgage rates led essentially to a freeze of existing home sales. Ultimately, this resulted in the lowest existing home sales in almost three decades. And given the strong historical correlation between existing home sales and appliance sales, the discretionary appliance sales, which are margin attractive, slowed down significantly.', 'This was mitigated by strong replacement demand, which tends to be less margin attractive. These strong replacement sales confirmed our view of more intensive use patterns of appliances, leading to shorter replacement cycles, a favorable trend which we expect to continue in the foreseeable future. Now, the key question is, what does this all mean for 2024? Let me start on the housing macro cycle. We remain bullish on the mid- and long-term housing cycle. The market has been undersupplied for over a decade by 3 million to 4 million units. The long overdue rebalancing of demand and supply will occur at one point, but not in the very short term. While we already see a gradual and steady recovery of new home orders and starts, we all know that these trends typically need six to nine months to turn into appliance sales.', ""The existing home sales market, on the other hand, will need a catalyst to unfreeze. That catalyst can only be a return to lower mortgage rates, which we expect to moderate as the year progresses. So, how will we position ourselves in 2024? Essentially, it will be all around cost discipline and margin expansion. On the cost side, we have put actions in place to deliver $300 million to $400 million in cost savings. While this number may appear lower than in 2023, we're not factoring any raw material savings. So, these $300 million to $400 million are all structural cost takeout actions. The margin expansion will essentially be driven by the benefits of a refocused portfolio after the completion of the EMEA transaction, as well as a very disciplined approach focused only on value-creating promotions and product mix."", 'You will see later in our presentation a full year negative impact of pricing, but this is entirely related to carryover pricing effects. Lastly, as it relates to our portfolio transformation, we continue to expect to close our EMEA transaction by April. And in anticipation of this transaction closure, we are changing our reporting segments. We will not only highlight our major domestic appliance business in North America, Latin America, and Asia, but also provide visibility to our KitchenAid small domestic appliance global business. With strong margins, the KitchenAid small domestic appliance business is a critical component of our brand and product portfolio, improving life at home for our consumers. I am confident that our refocused portfolio, cost actions, and improving free cash flow generation positions us for continued shareholder value creation in 2024.', 'Now, turning to Slide 6, I will provide an overview of our fourth quarter results. We delivered over 3% of revenue growth, including over 1 point of year-over-year share gains in North America, coupled with $350 million of reduced costs. Working capital conversion and free cash flow of $366 million was impacted by shipments occurring later in the quarter than expected. We exited 2023 with elevated trade customer inventories, which we expect to normalize mostly in the first quarter of 2024. Ultimately, we delivered ongoing earnings per share of $3.85, supported by tax benefits related to the Europe transaction. And now, I will turn it over to Jim to review our Q4 regional results and perspective on 2024, including our plans for the proceeds of a recently announced India transaction.', ""Jim Peters: Thanks, Marc. Good morning, everyone. Turning to Slide 7, I'll review fourth quarter results for our North America business. We delivered 1% of revenue growth and 260 basis points of margin expansion. Sales growth was driven by over 1 point of year-over-year share gains, resulting from new product introductions and improved supply chain execution, while this was partially offset by a normalized promotional environment. Additionally, resilient replacement demand lifted the US industry 2%. Fourth quarter margin expansion was driven by significantly reduced cost, partially offset by negative price/mix from a normalized promotional environment and lower consumer discretionary demand due to higher mortgage rates in 2023 slowing down existing home sales."", ""Overall, the region delivered 8.4% margins for the quarter. Turning to Slide 8, I'll review our results for our Europe, Middle East and Africa business. Revenue was down 3% year-over-year as the region continues to see demand weakness from negative consumer sentiment. Strong cost takeout actions and held for sale accounting benefits drove nearly 400 basis points of margin expansion year-over-year to approximately 3%. We continue to expect the Europe transaction to close by April 2024, and later in the call, I will provide additional insights into the expected impact to our 2024 guidance and free cash flows. Turning to Slide 9, I'll review the results for our Latin America business. With strong industry demand throughout the region and share gains in Brazil, net sales, excluding currency, increased approximately 13%."", ""Overall, the region delivered solid EBIT margins of 6%, flat to last year as cost actions were offset by negative price/mix and losses in Argentina from currency devaluation and costs related to ramping up our new laundry factory. Turning to Slide 10, I'll review the results for our Asia business. The region saw net sales growth of 9%, driven by share gains and improving industry. EBIT margins of 1.3% with cost takeout actions more than offset by negative price/mix. As you may have seen, we recently announced our intention to sell up to 24% of Whirlpool India's outstanding shares while retaining a majority interest. We truly believe in the long-term trajectory of India. It is one of the strongest growth opportunities for Whirlpool. Whirlpool of India's long-term outlook for growth and margins are both in the high single digits, making India very attractive to operate in."", 'At the same time, this financial profile has created a very strong local public market valuation. Turning to Slide 12, I will review our 2024 guidance, which includes the Europe major domestic appliance business only for the first quarter of the year. We have provided a reset baseline for 2023 results excluding our Europe major domestic appliance business from Q2 through Q4 of 2023. The reset baseline excludes approximately $2.6 billion net sales and approximately $33 million of EBIT, creating a like-for-like comparison for 2024. On a like-for-like basis, 2023 net sales were approximately $16.9 billion, with ongoing EBIT margin of 6.8%. We expect flat 2024 net sales, including $700 million of sales from the EMEA major domestic appliance business in Q1, and flat EBIT margin year-over-year on a like-for-like basis.', 'We expect 2024 free cash flow of $550 million to $650 million, a 50% to 75% increase, driven by improved earnings and working capital reduction. We expect full year ongoing earnings per share of $13 to $15, including an adjusted effective tax rate of 0%, an increase compared to 2023, which impacts 2024 earnings per share by approximately $1. Turning to Slide 13, we show the drivers of our full year 6.8% ongoing EBIT margin guidance. We expect a negative impact of 150 basis points to 175 basis points from price/mix. This reflects the first half of 2024 carryover effect as the promotional environment normalized in the second half of 2023. We also expect continuing softer mix and discretionary demand in the first half of 2024 from historically low existing home sales, partially offset by new product introductions.', 'As we drive further reductions to our cost structure, we expect approximately 175 basis points of net cost margin benefit from $300 million to $400 million of cost takeout actions. We expect minimal to no impact to EBIT margins from raw materials this year based on recent commodity trends and executed supply agreements. We plan to continue a strong cadence of new product introductions, with investments in marketing and technology impacting margins by approximately 25 basis points. Finally, we expect our portfolio transformation to provide approximately 75 basis points of margin improvement as we contribute the margin dilutive European major domestic appliance business to the newly formed company. On Slide 14, I will provide context on our significant cost takeout opportunity.', 'We experienced unprecedented cost inflation of approximately $2.5 billion in 2021 and 2022. In 2023, we were able to drive $800 million of cost takeout, which is a significant step in resetting our cost structure. We expect to further reduce our costs by $300 million to $400 million this year. 2024 will benefit from $100 million of cost actions taken last year. We expect $100 million to $200 million of additional cost takeout with our manufacturing and supply chain operations, benefiting from ongoing productivity initiatives and reduced complexity as we enter 2024. And we also expect $100 million of second-half benefit as our ongoing portfolio transformation allows us to simplify our organizational operating model. Turning to Slide 15, I will introduce our new segment reporting structure effective January 1, 2024.', 'We have updated our reporting structure with the anticipated closure of the Europe transaction. Our regional operating segments historically included the results of our KitchenAid small domestic appliance business in the geographical regions they operated in. We will now only report the major domestic appliance businesses within their respective regions. We will now report our global KitchenAid small domestic appliance business also known as SDA, as a separate segment. This business has an iconic brand and premium products with a reputation for performance and quality, perfectly fitting our vision of being the best kitchen and laundry company. We will continue to have strong brand synergies between the small domestic appliance and major domestic appliance product portfolio.', ""The regional MDA businesses will have margin profiles 30 basis points to 40 basis points lower than the previously reported figures due to SDA reporting as its own segment. On our Investor Relations website and yesterday's 8-K, we have provided recast quarterly results for 2021 through the third quarter of 2023 reflecting our $1 billion SDA business with its strong 15%-plus margins. Turning to Slide 16, I will review our new segment guidance. Starting with industry demand, we expect a dynamic global industry to be flat to up 2%. We expect to see similar demand trends in the US that we saw in the second half of 2023, with resilient replacement demand creating a solid footing for industry volumes and consumer discretionary demand continuing to be impacted by elevated mortgage rates driving down existing home sales."", 'Overall, we expect MDA North America to be flat to slightly positive as well as we expect the MDA Latin America industry to also be flat to slightly positive. India has one of the fastest growth rates globally and we expect MDA Asia industry volumes to accelerate by 4% to 6%. While we expect the SDA Global industry to be up 2% to 4%, we want to preface this guidance with the fact that KitchenAid is largely present in the premium segment and also not in all SDA categories. Finally, we expect demand contraction of negative 8% to 6% in the first quarter for MDA Europe from continued negative consumer sentiment. For MDA North America, we expect to deliver full year margins of approximately 9%, with promotional carryover negatively impacting first-half margins and elevated channel inventories impacting first-quarter demand.', 'We expect approximately 50 basis points to 75 basis points of sequential margin expansion every quarter and to exit 2024 with EBIT margins of approximately 10%. For MDA Latin America, we expect EBIT expansion and strong margins of 6.5%, with cost takeout actions and improved consumer sentiment. For MDA Asia, we expect margin expansion to approximately 3% EBIT margins. For SDA Global, we expect very attractive EBIT margins of approximately 15.5%. Lastly, we expect MDA Europe to deliver approximately 1.5% margins in the first quarter. And overall, expect an ongoing total EBIT margin of 6.8%. Turning to Slide 17, let me provide you with additional detail on our US industry expectations. Replacement demand drove industry growth in 2023 and we expect this trend to continue into 2024.', 'The last four years of elevated usage is shrinking the historical average life of appliances, coupled with an installed base from 2015 through 2017 that grew 4% to 5% and is nearing replacement. This is driving replacement demand to approximately 60% of industry volumes. We expect to continue to drive value creating share gain in 2024. With housing starts trending higher in the second half of 2023, Whirlpool is disproportionately positioned to benefit from new construction demand. Forecast for 2024 are calling for low- to mid-single digit growth in housing starts, most likely benefiting Whirlpool in the second half of 2024 or early 2025. For every 5% increase in new construction, we could see approximately $100 million impact with our leading builder share.', 'Finally, discretionary demand, which accounts for approximately 25% of total industry volumes is driven by existing home sales, which are coming off their worst year since 1995 and are expected to improve in the back half of 2024 as interest rates moderate. Turning to Slide 18, I will share further perspective on 2024. We expect soft discretionary demand and higher retail inventory levels to weigh on total industry expectations in the first half of 2024 with a more pronounced impact on Q1. We expect 2024 promotional activity to be at similar levels as the second half of 2023, creating a margin headwind to the first half of the year. We expect cost actions from 2023 to benefit the first half of 2024, while additional cost actions ramp up. Additionally, the demand and earning seasonality of our SDA Global business varies from our major domestic appliance business.', 'It delivers approximately 75% of its demand and profitability in the second half of every year, with consumers favoring small domestic appliances as gifts and increased baking activities in the fall and holiday season. Overall, we expect to deliver approximately 35% to 40% of our earnings in the first half of the year. Turning to Slide 19, I will provide the drivers of our free cash flow guidance. We expect improved cash earnings of approximately $1.1 billion to $1.2 billion. We expect approximately $600 million of capital expenditures as we continue to invest in our products and fund organic growth, including our plans to launch over 100 new products in 2024. We plan to improve our working capital conversion by approximately $100 million largely through inventory reductions.', 'We expect approximately $50 million of restructuring cash outlays related to previously executed actions and complexity reduction with our simplified organizational model after the Europe transaction. Overall, we expect to deliver free cash flow of $550 million to $650 million, or approximately 3.5% of net sales, including approximately $200 million to $300 million of cash consumption for MDA Europe business operations prior to the closure and one-time charges. Turning to Slide 20, I will review how we are well positioned to deliver our 2024 capital allocation priorities. We have a solid balance sheet with $1.6 billion of cash on hand coupled with $550 million to $650 million of 2024 expected free cash flows, plus anticipated $400 million to $500 million of proceeds from asset sales, as we previously announced our intention to sell a portion of our interest in Whirlpool of India and recently signed an agreement to divest of our Brastemp branded water filtration business in Brazil.', 'As you can see, we are well positioned to deliver our clear capital allocation priorities for 2024. Last year marked the 68th consecutive year of steady or increasing dividends from Whirlpool. Subject to Board approval, we expect to pay dividends of approximately $400 million. We are committed to maintaining our strong investment grade credit rating and reducing our debt by at least an additional $500 million. We expect limited share buybacks to offset share dilution. Finally, we are committed to funding innovation and growth with capital expenditures plus research and development of approximately 6% of net sales. Turning to Slide 21, you can see our commitment to deleveraging our balance sheet. As a reminder, in 2022, with the acquisition of the value-creating InSinkErator business, we increased our debt by $2.5 billion in term loans.', 'Compared to 2022, we expect at least $1 billion of debt reduction by the end of this year. With the combination of strong free cash flows expected in 2025 in the first full year following the close of the Europe transaction and our product innovations delivering earnings expansion, and beginning to realize the free cash flow benefits of our adjusted effective tax rate, we are confident in our ability to further reduce our net debt leverage to approximately 2 times by 2026. Now, I will turn the call back over to Marc.', ""Marc Bitzer: Thanks, Jim. Turning to Slide 23, let me provide an update on our Europe transaction. As I mentioned in our third quarter earnings call, we passed major regulatory milestones with the approvals from the European Commission, Germany, Austria, and China. The UK's Competition and Market Authority is in the process of conducting a Phase 2 review of the transaction. We are continuing a constructive dialogue with the CMA about the newly formed company that will benefit consumers. And we continue to expect the transaction will close by April. Turning to Slide 24, let me recap what you heard today. We will further improve our cost structure and are confident in our ability to deliver $300 million to $400 million of cost takeout."", ""Our portfolio transformation to a higher-growth, higher-margin business continues to progress. The Europe transaction will meaningfully accelerate our structural free cash flows by approximately $200 million to $300 million in 2025. We have clear capital allocation priorities, including strong dividends and reducing debt leverage, supported by a flexible balance sheet with $1.6 billion cash on hand, along with strong 2024 cash generation. We're confident in the trajectory of our business and our portfolio transformation to deliver sustained shareholder returns. Finally, I will close on Slide 25 with an invitation to join us at our 2024 Investor Day on February 27th at the New York Stock Exchange. We look forward to hosting our first Investor Day since 2019."", ""We plan to review how our portfolio transformation is creating a very different Whirlpool, positioning us towards higher-growth and higher-margin business. We're excited to review our growth and margin expansion opportunities for our MDA North America business, we will highlight the rich history of our premium KitchenAid SDA business, in addition to introducing the remainder of our 2026 value-creation goals. We hope to see you there. Now, we will end our formal remarks and open it up for questions."", 'Operator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Sam Darkatsh from Raymond James.

deliver a more profitable and sustainable growth engine for LYB.\xa0 In the fourth quarter, we announced the divestiture of our Ethylene Oxide and Derivatives business and our decision to build the first catalytic advanced recycling plant using LYB\'s proprietary MoReTec technology.\xa0 And just two weeks ago, we announced a new propylene and polypropylene joint venture in Saudi Arabia.\xa0 These actions demonstrate our laser-sharp focus on execution,"" said Peter Vanacker, LYB Chief Executive Officer.', 'Significantly lower fourth quarter gasoline crack spreads impacted refining and oxyfuels margins as well as the value of co-product fuels in the Olefins & Polyolefins Americas segment.\xa0 In the North American polyethylene market, steady domestic demand and increased exports were supported by lower ethane raw material costs.\xa0 Seasonally slow demand resulted in low operating rates for most businesses.', 'Throughout the year, petrochemical markets faced headwinds from soft global demand, capacity additions and economic uncertainty.\xa0 Markets were broadly pressured by weak demand for durable goods, which impacted margins in the Olefins & Polyolefins, Intermediates & Derivatives and Advanced Polymer Solutions segments.\xa0 In contrast, oxyfuels margins benefited from tight supply and strong summertime gasoline crack spreads, leading to record annual oxyfuels earnings for LYB.', 'LYB generated $4.9 billion in cash from operating activities during 2023.\xa0 The company remained committed to a disciplined approach to capital allocation.\xa0 In 2023, approximately $1.5 billion was reinvested in the business through capital expenditures while $1.8 billion was returned to shareholders through quarterly dividends and share repurchases.\xa0 The

of more than $300 million of net income and $400 million of recurring annual EBITDA."", '""In the ten months since we launched LyondellBasell\'s strategy, the passion, commitment and alignment of our global team is increasingly visible in our actions, culture and results.\xa0 The successful startup of our new propylene oxide and oxyfuels plant is one example of our commitment to grow and upgrade our core businesses.\xa0 We built strong foundations for our Circular and Low Carbon Solutions business by forming partnerships to source and sort plastic waste while moving forward on our first tranche of advanced recycling capacity.\xa0 And our cultural transformation is well underway.\xa0 Employee enthusiasm for the Value Enhancement Program allowed us to far exceed the original 2023 targets for the program.\xa0 Outstanding cash conversion bolstered our investment-grade balance sheet and provided strong returns for LYB shareholders,"" said Vanacker.', 'OUTLOOKIn the first quarter of 2024, seasonally slow demand and economic uncertainty are expected to provide continued headwinds for most businesses.\xa0 Relatively low ethane raw material costs are continuing to benefit North American Olefins & Polyolefins margins while regional demand is showing modest improvement.\xa0 The company expects oxyfuels and refining margins to be within typical winter seasonal ranges.\xa0 In China, January demand was subdued as buyers managed inventories around Lunar New Year holidays and growth remained uncertain.\xa0 Spring and summer seasonal demand improvements are expected across global markets.\xa0\xa0 LYB is aligning first quarter operating rates with global demand and expects to operate Olefins & Polyolefins Americas assets at approximately 80%, and both Olefins & Polyolefins EAI assets and Intermediates & Derivatives assets at approximately 75%.', '(d)', '2027 incremental Normalized EBITDA reflects expected improvement over a 2022 year-end asset portfolio with

TO FINANCIAL MEASURESThis release makes reference to certain non-GAAP financial measures as defined in Regulation G of the U.S. Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.', ""We report our financial results in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, but believe that certain non-GAAP financial measures, such as EBITDA, and EBITDA, net income and diluted EPS exclusive of identified items provide useful supplemental information to investors regarding the underlying business trends and performance of the company's ongoing operations and are useful for period-over-period comparisons of such operations.\xa0 Non-GAAP financial measures should be considered as a supplement to, and not as a substitute for, or superior to, the financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP."", 'We calculate EBITDA as income from continuing operations plus interest expense (net), provision for (benefit from) income taxes, and depreciation and amortization.\xa0 EBITDA should not be considered an alternative to profit or operating profit for any period as an indicator of our performance, or as an alternative to operating cash flows as a measure of our liquidity.\xa0 We also present EBITDA, net income and diluted EPS exclusive of identified items.\xa0 Identified items include adjustments for ""lower of cost or market"" (""LCM""), impairments and refinery exit costs.\xa0 Our inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market.\xa0 Cost is determined using the last-in, first-out (""LIFO"") inventory valuation methodology, which means that the most recently incurred costs are charged to cost of sales and inventories are valued at the earliest acquisition costs.\xa0 Fluctuation in the prices of crude oil, natural gas and correlated products from period to period may result in the recognition of charges to adjust the value of inventory to the lower of cost or market in periods of falling prices and the reversal of those charges in subsequent interim periods, within the same fiscal year as the charge, as market prices recover.\xa0 Property, plant and equipment are recorded at historical costs.\xa0 If it is determined that an asset or asset group\'s undiscounted future cash flows will not be sufficient to recover the carrying amount, an impairment charge is recognized to write the asset down to its estimated fair value.\xa0 Goodwill is tested for impairment annually in the fourth quarter or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the fair value of a reporting unit with goodwill is below its carrying amount.\xa0 If it is determined that the carrying value of the reporting unit including goodwill exceeds its fair value, an impairment charge is recognized.\xa0 We assess our equity investments for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the investment may not be recoverable.\xa0 If the decline in value is considered to be other-than-temporary, the investment is written down to its estimated fair value.\xa0 In April 2022 we announced our decision to cease operation of our Houston Refinery.\xa0 In connection with exiting the refinery business, we began to incur costs primarily consisting of accelerated lease amortization costs, personnel related costs, accretion of asset retirement obligations and depreciation of asset retirement costs.', 'Recurring annual EBITDA for the Value Enhancement Program is the year-end EBITDA run rate estimated based on 2017-2019 mid-cycle margins and modest inflation relative to a 2021 baseline.', 'Normalized EBITDA assumes 2013-2022 historical average margins and operating rates and reflects the benefits associated with the following strategic initiatives: Grow & Upgrade the Core, Building a Profitable CLCS Business and Step Up Performance & Culture.\xa0 Incremental Normalized EBITDA cannot be reconciled to net income due to the inherent difficulty in quantifying certain amounts that are necessary for such reconciliation at the strategic initiative level, including adjustments that could be made for interest expense (net), provision for (benefit from) income taxes and depreciation & amortization, the amounts of which, based on historical experience, could be significant.', 'Cash conversion is a measure commonly used by investors to evaluate liquidity.\xa0 Cash conversion means net cash provided by operating activities divided by EBITDA excluding LCM and impairment.\xa0 We believe cash conversion is an important financial metric as it helps management and other parties determine how efficiently the company is converting earnings into cash.', 'These non-GAAP financial measures as presented herein, may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies due

However, causing a huge disappointment to market participants, the central bank clearly said that it is highly unlikely that the first interest rate cut will occur in March.', 'Fed Chairman Jerome Powell said, “Based on the meeting today, I would tell you that I don’t think it’s likely that the committee will reach a level of confidence by the time of the March meeting to identify March as the time to do that. But that’s to be seen.”', 'At the same time, the post-FOMC statement removed the part that signaled the central bank still has a tightening bias. This categorically means that the rate hike rate regime, which started in March 2022, is over.', 'Powell added, “We believe that our policy rate is likely at its peak for this tightening cycle and that if the economy evolves broadly as expected, it will likely be appropriate to begin dialing back policy restraint, at some point this year.”', 'Following the Fed’s decisions, Wall Street fell sharply. The Dow slid 0.8%, marking its worst day since December. The S&P 500 fell 1.6% to post its worst day since September. The Nasdaq Composite plummeted 2.2%, recording its worst single-day performance since October.', 'The impressive bull run is set to continue in 2024. The Fed in all probability, will initiate a rate cut latest by June. A lower interest rate regime will boost economic growth speeding up investment by businesses. In 2022, small-cap companies suffered from record-high inflation, a soaring interest rate and fear of an impending recession. However, in 2023, this segment of the economy found some relief from these three concerns. The rate cut will further boost mid and small-sized enterprises.', 'A lower interest rate regime will be beneficial to high-growth sectors like technology and consumer discretionary. Several companies in these spaces depend on cheap sources of credit as the full potential of their business is realized over a long period. A low risk-free interest rate will reduce the discount rate thereby increasing the net present value of investment in these stocks.', 'The global supply-chain system has been improving slowly since last year as U.S. corporate behemoths are rescheduling their supply-chain system’s bypassing of China. Moreover, the fundamentals of the U.S. economy remain firm despite record-high inflation and interest rate.', 'The Department of Commerce reported that the U.S. economy grew at a rate of 3.3% in fourth-quarter 2023, well above the consensus estimate of 2%. The U.S. GDP rose 2.5% in 2023 compared with 1.9% in 2022. At the beginning of 2023, the consensus estimate for full-year GDP was 2%. The resilient labor market started showing softness but it hasn’t crumbled. Personal consumption remains robust.', 'Finally, a preliminary estimate revealed that a massive $1.4 trillion entered U.S. money market funds primarily due to an extremely high interest rate regime, with cash yielding around 5%. A systematic decline in the market interest rate will shift a major part of these gigantic funds to equity markets.\xa0\xa0\xa0 ', 'In this regard, every dip will be a good buying opportunity even for those stocks that have skyrocketed in 2023 and have strong potential for 2024 and beyond. At this stage, several stocks look attractive for future growth.

Several studies have shown limited to no success of brokerage recommendations in guiding investors to pick stocks with the best price increase potential.', 'Are you wondering why? The vested interest of brokerage firms in a stock they cover often results in a strong positive bias of their analysts in rating it. Our research shows that for every ""Strong Sell"" recommendation, brokerage firms assign five ""Strong Buy"" recommendations.', ""This means that the interests of these institutions are not always aligned with those of retail investors, giving little insight into the direction of a stock's future price movement. It would therefore be best to use this information to validate your own analysis or a tool that has proven to be highly effective at predicting stock price movements."", ""With an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, which classifies stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), is a reliable indicator of a stock's near -term price performance. So, validating the Zacks Rank with ABR could go a long way in making a profitable investment decision."", 'Zacks Rank Should Not Be Confused With ABR', 'Although both Zacks Rank and ABR are displayed in a range of 1-5, they are different measures altogether.', 'The ABR is calculated solely based on brokerage recommendations and is typically displayed with decimals (example: 1.28). In contrast, the Zacks Rank is a quantitative model allowing investors to harness the power of earnings estimate revisions. It is displayed in whole numbers -- 1 to 5.', ""It has been and continues to be the case that analysts employed by brokerage firms are overly optimistic with their recommendations. Because of their employers' vested interests, these analysts issue more favorable ratings than their research would support, misguiding investors far more often than helping them."", 'On the other hand, earnings estimate revisions are at the core of the Zacks Rank. And empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.', 'Furthermore, the different grades of the Zacks Rank are applied proportionately across all stocks for which brokerage analysts provide earnings estimates for the current year. In other words, at all times, this tool maintains a balance among the five ranks it assigns.', 'There is also a key difference between the ABR and Zacks Rank when it comes to freshness. When you look at the ABR, it may not be up-to-date. Nonetheless, since brokerage analysts constantly revise their earnings estimates to reflect changing business trends, and their actions get reflected in the Zacks Rank quickly enough, it is always timely in predicting future stock prices.', 'Is UNH Worth Investing In?', 'Looking at the earnings estimate revisions for UnitedHealth, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has declined 0.3% over the past month to $27.81.', ""Analysts' growing pessimism over the company's earnings prospects, as indicated by strong agreement among them in revising EPS estimates lower, could be a legitimate reason for the stock to plunge in the near term."", ""The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) for UnitedHealth.

(NASDAQ:ADP) had a good week, as its shares rose 4.7% to close at US$247 following the release of its second-quarter results. Automatic Data Processing reported in line with analyst predictions, delivering revenues of US$4.7b and statutory earnings per share of US$2.13, suggesting the business is executing well and in line with its plan. Following the result, the analysts have updated their earnings model, and it would be good to know whether they think there's been a strong change in the company's prospects, or if it's business as usual. With this in mind, we've gathered the latest statutory forecasts to see what the analysts are expecting for next year."", ' View our latest analysis for Automatic Data Processing ', ""Taking into account the latest results, the most recent consensus for Automatic Data Processing from 17 analysts is for revenues of US$19.1b in 2024. If met, it would imply an okay 3.0% increase on its revenue over the past 12 months. Statutory earnings per share are predicted to accumulate 5.4% to US$9.13. In the lead-up to this report, the analysts had been modelling revenues of US$19.1b and earnings per share (EPS) of US$9.12 in 2024. So it's pretty clear that, although the analysts have updated their estimates, there's been no major change in expectations for the business following the latest results."", ""It will come as no surprise then, to learn that the consensus price target is largely unchanged at US$253. There's another way to think about price targets though, and that's to look at the range of price targets put forward by analysts, because a wide range of estimates could suggest a diverse view on possible outcomes for the business. There are some variant perceptions on Automatic Data Processing, with the most bullish analyst valuing it at US$280 and the most bearish at US$227 per share. This is a very narrow spread of estimates, implying either that Automatic Data Processing is an easy company to value, or - more likely - the analysts are relying heavily on some key assumptions."", ""Looking at the bigger picture now, one of the ways we can make sense of these forecasts is to see how they measure up against both past performance and industry growth estimates. We can infer from the latest estimates that forecasts expect a continuation of Automatic Data Processing'shistorical trends, as the 6.1% annualised revenue growth to the end of 2024 is roughly in line with the 6.1% annual growth over the past five years. Juxtapose this against our data, which suggests that other companies (with analyst coverage) in the industry are forecast to see their revenues grow 6.4% per year. It's clear that while Automatic Data Processing's revenue growth is expected to continue on its current trajectory, it's only expected to grow in line with the industry itself."", ""The most important thing to take away is that there's been no major change in sentiment, with the analysts reconfirming that the business is performing in line with their previous earnings per share estimates. Happily, there were no real changes to revenue forecasts, with the business still expected to grow in line with the overall industry. The consensus price target held steady at US$253, with the latest estimates not enough to have an impact on their price targets."", ""Following on from that line of thought, we think that the long-term prospects of the business are much more relevant than next year's earnings.

Moving on to a broader update. During the second quarter, we launched a new brand advertising campaign themed, the next anything. The campaign highlights how the world of work is always changing, sometimes gradually, sometimes suddenly, and trusted business solutions must evolve with it. The theme aligns with our strategic priorities to give our clients the advantage of our leading technology, expertise, and scale. In Q2, we continue to push forward on our first strategic priority to lead with best-in-class HCM technology. A key part of that is the rollout of ADP Assist, our cross-platform solution powered by GenAI that proactively delivers actionable insights in plain language to enhance HR productivity, aid decision-making, and streamline day-to-day tasks for our clients and their employees.', ""ADP Assist seamlessly integrates with ADP products across multiple platforms. Using an intuitive conversational interface, it provides valuable and contextual insights which touch every aspect of HR. For example, in addition to the features we shared with you last quarter, including our natural language reporting capability, in Q2, we integrated natural language search capabilities into our run platform, which allows it to understand intent behind the search terms and use GenAI to mine ADP's deep knowledge base to deliver easy to use and effective content. ADP Assist also helps clients validate payrolls and solve common employee challenges across HR, payroll, time, and benefits. It's a comprehensive experience that is trained on the industry's largest and deepest HCM dataset and our deep knowledge base to surface highly credible and actionable insights so that clients can make smarter decisions."", 'We are excited about the roadmap ahead for all of our major solutions, and we expect it to help us build on the recognition we continue to earn in the market. In Q2 alone, we were pleased to be recognized for product leadership by three major industry analyst rankings. Everest Group named ADP the highest leader out of 27 providers in its multi-country payroll solutions PEAK Matrix report. NelsonHall identified ADP as a leader in its Payroll Services Vendor Evaluation and Assessment tool in all markets. And Ventana Research named us an exemplary leader across its North American, global, and payroll management buyers guide for performing the best and meeting overall product and customer experience requirements. Our second strategic priority is to provide unmatched expertise and outsourcing solutions.', 'We shared last quarter that we were beginning to equip our associates with GenAI capabilities through our Agent Assist technology. In Q2, we expanded our call summarization deployment to a greater portion of our service associates and started to see productivity gains with shorter handle time and improved service quality. With our global service associates fielding millions of calls annually, we are incredibly excited to test ways to optimize those client interactions. Our third strategic priority is to benefit our clients through our global scale, and we continue to lean into this advantage. In Q2, we announced a strategic collaboration with Convera, a global business to business payments company to help our multi-country clients manage the complexity of global payroll and cross-border payments through an integrated platform.', ""By combining Convera’s payment solutions with our global payroll expertise, we're enhancing the client experience by minimizing the need to access various banking platforms and improving payment accuracy, compliance, and security. We also announced the launch of ADP retirement trust services to support our growing retirement services business. Standing up our own trust services entity demonstrates our scale and commitment to our retirement clients, positioning us on par with financial industry leaders and ahead of HCM competitors that rely on third parties. This commitment can really matter to financial advisors, keeps data within ADP's trusted ecosystem, and provides a cost and price benefit to ADP and our clients over the long term. Our scale also affords us the opportunity to partner with other leading technology providers in innovative ways, and we continue to expand on many of those partnerships to provide our sales implementation and service teams with client-specific insights to quickly address market shifts, drive more personalized interactions, and deepen our overall client engagement."", ""Overall, our second quarter represented strong outcomes on the financial front and with respect to our key strategic priorities. I'd like to thank our associates who continue to deliver exceptional products and outstanding service to our clients, particularly now, as many of them are in the middle of our most hectic time of year completing year-end work. I'm proud to share that their efforts help drive our overall Net Promoter Score to its highest level ever in the second quarter. Thank you again for all that you do for ADP and for our clients. And now, I'll turn it over to Don."", ""Don McGuire: Thank you, Maria, and good morning, everyone. I'll provide more color on our results for the quarter, as well as our updated fiscal 2024 outlook. Overall, we reported a strong second quarter, with our consolidated revenue growth moderating in line with our expectations, and our adjusted EBIT margin coming in slightly better than expected. However, the interest rate backdrop has changed since we last provided our full-year outlook, and we are lightly tweaking our outlook, which I'll detail. I'll start with Employer Services. ES segment revenue increased 8% on a reported basis, and 7% on an organic constant currency basis, coming in slightly ahead of our expectations. As Maria shared, we continue to grow our ES new business bookings, resulting in a record second quarter bookings volume."", 'Our small business portfolio and international business provided outsized growth contributions this quarter. And with a steady HCM demand environment and healthy pipelines, we feel on track for our 4% to 7% new business bookings growth outlook for the year. As mentioned earlier, our ES retention declined slightly in Q2 versus the prior year, but again exceeded our expectations. Given our first half retention outperformance, we are increasing our full-year retention outlook slightly. We now anticipate a 40 to 60 basis point decline in our full-year retention, which is 10 basis points better than our prior forecast. ES pays per control growth of 2% in Q2, was in line with our expectations, and we are maintaining our 1% to 2% growth outlook for the full-year.', 'And client funds interest revenue increased in line with our expectations in Q2, as a slight decline in our average client funds balance, which we discussed last quarter, was more than offset by an increase in our average yield. However, we are revising our full-year client funds interest outlook lower to reflect the change in prevailing interest rates since our last update. We now expect fiscal 2024 client funds interest revenue of $985 million to $995 million, and we expect a net impact from our client funds extended investment strategy of $835 million to $845 million, representing a reduction of about $20 million at the midpoint. In total, there is no change to our fiscal 2024 ES revenue growth forecast of 7% to 8%. Our ES margin increased 170 basis points in Q2, driven by both operating leverage and contribution from client funds interest revenue growth, but reflecting the impact of a reduced client funds interest revenue forecast, as well as a slight increase in expected GenAI related spend, we are tweaking our fiscal 2024 ES margin outlook and now anticipate the lower end of our prior margin range.', ""Moving on to the PEO, we had 3% revenue growth, driven by 2% growth in average work site employees in the second quarter. These metrics were in line with expectation, and we are encouraged to see signs of stabilization in our PEO pays per control growth. As Maria mentioned, our PEO new business bookings were very strong in Q2. With continued healthy activity levels, we continue to anticipate a gradual ramp in our work site employee growth in the back half of fiscal 2024, and we are maintaining our full-year growth outlook of 2% to 3%. PEO margin decreased 50 basis points in Q2. As we shared last quarter, we assume this year's workers' compensation reserve release benefit will be lower than last year's benefit, and we are further narrowing our PEO margin expectation to be down 80 to 100 basis points in fiscal 2024 versus our prior expectation of decline of 50 to 100 basis points."", ""Putting it all together, there is no change to our fiscal 2024 consolidated revenue growth outlook of 6% to 7%. With the two changes to segment margin, we now expect our adjusted EBIT margin to increase by 60 to 70 basis points versus our prior outlook, for an increase of 60 to 80 basis points. We continue to expect an effective tax rate of around 23%, and we still anticipate fiscal 2024 adjusted EPS growth of 10% to 12%, with the middle of that range the most likely outcome given current assumptions. Thank you, and I'll now turn it back to the operator for Q&A."", 'See also 15 Highest Quality Bottled Water Brands in The US and 15 Countries With The Highest Labor Shortages In The World.', 'To continue reading the Q&A session, please click here.']"

Please go ahead.', 'David Young', ""Good morning, and welcome. This morning, we will be hearing remarks about earnings for 2023 as well as our outlook for 2024. First, Dan Amos, Chairman, CEO and President of Aflac Incorporated, will provide an overview of our results and operations in Japan and the United States. Then Max Broden, Executive Vice President and CFO of Aflac Incorporated, will provide an update on our financial results and current capital and liquidity as well as our outlook for 2024. These topics are also addressed in the materials we posted with our earnings release and financial supplement on investors.aflac.com.In addition, Max provided his quarterly video update, which also includes information about the outlook for 2024. We also posted, under financials on the same site, updated slides of investment details related to our commercial real estate and middle market loans.For Q&A, we are also joined by Virgil Miller, President of Aflac U.S.; Charles Lake, Chairman and Representative Director, President of Aflac International; Masatoshi Koide, President and Representative Director, Aflac Life Insurance Japan; and Brad Dyslin, Global Chief Investment Officer, President of Aflac Global Investments.Before we begin, some statements in this teleconference are forward-looking within the meaning of federal securities laws. Although we believe these statements are reasonable, we can give no assurance that they will prove to be accurate because they are prospective in nature. Actual results could differ materially from those we discuss today. We encourage you to look at our annual report on Form 10-K for some of the various risk factors that could materially impact our results.As I mentioned earlier, the earnings release is available on investors.aflac.com and includes reconciliations of certain non-U.S. GAAP measures. I'll now turn the call over to Dan. Dan?"", 'Daniel Paul Amos', ""Thank you, David, and good morning, everyone. We're glad you're joining us.Reflecting on 2023, it was a very good year. Our management team, employees, sales distribution have continued to work tirelessly as dedicated stewards of our business. This has allowed us to be there for our policyholders when they need us most, just as we promised.Aflac Incorporated delivered a very strong earnings for the year. Net earnings per diluted share for 2023 were $7.78. Adjusted earnings per diluted share was $6.23. We're the best in the company's history despite the weakening yen and the impact of the reinsurance retrocession late in the fourth quarter.Beginning with Japan, Aflac Japan generated solid overall financial results in 2023. For the year, total adjusted revenues declined 3.6% to nearly JPY 1.5 trillion, largely reflecting the impacts of reinsurance and paid-up policies. But this was largely offset by a 7.3% decrease in total benefits and adjusted expenses.Pretax adjusted earnings increased 6% to nearly JPY 457 billion for the year. As a result, Aflac Japan produced an extremely strong profit margin of 30.5%. I am pleased with Aflac Japan's 10.9% year-over-year increase in sales, which was largely driven by a 26% increase in cancer insurance sales, with very significant contributions from Japan Post Company and Japan Post Insurance as well as other alliances, Dai-ichi Life and Daido Life.As you may recall, Aflac Japan aims to have a product lineup to meet customers' needs during any life stage. Our latest medical insurance is designed to appeal to younger policyholders' basic needs, and older and existing policyholders who want additional or updated coverage.While our medical insurance sales were off for the year, they increased 6.5% year-over-year in the fourth quarter, following the introduction of our new medical insurance product in mid-September. Similarly, Aflac Japan refreshed ways in child endowment in 2022 as a way of acquiring younger customers and also introducing opportunities to sell our core third sector products to them.Since the launch of our refreshed WAYS product, approximately 80% of our sales are the younger customers below the age of 50. The level of concurrent third sector sales remains above 50%. Given Japan's demographics, our product strategy is to fit the needs of the customers at any stage in life. Acquiring younger customers is critical to our success along with our intense focus on being where the customer wants to buy insurance. We have a broad network of distribution channels including agencies, alliance partners and banks. This reach continually optimizes opportunities to help provide financial protection to the Japanese consumers.We are working hard to support each channel. While the market presents challenges, we expect to reach JPY 67 billion to JPY 73 billion of sales in Japan by the end of 2026.Turning to the U.S. We also generated strong overall financial results in 2023. Total adjusted revenues increased 2.1% to $6.6 billion. The decline in total net benefits and claims was slightly offset by the increase in adjusted expenses.Pretax adjusted earnings increased 10.4% to an all-time high of $1.5 billion for the year. As a result, Aflac U.S. produced an extremely strong profit margin of 22.7%.Aflac U.S. sales increased 5% in 2023, which was at the lower end of our expectations. As you know, we've been focused on increasing persistency to grow profitable earned premium. In addition, we continually evaluate new business to ensure that it is profitable.During the fourth quarter, we made some tactical decisions to avoid sales opportunities to certain less profitable larger accounts like those of high turnover. At the same time, we focused on updating our products to ensure that our policyholders continue to realize the value of our products provide.As part of our efforts, we introduced our new cancer protection insurance policy in the second quarter of 2023. Since that time, our cancer insurance have increased nearly 25%. We know that when people experience the value of our products, it increases persistency, which benefits our policyholders and lower our expenses. I believe that the need for the products and the solutions we offer are as strong or stronger than ever before in both Japan and in the United States.We are leveraging every opportunity in Avenue to share this message with consumers, particularly given that our products are sold, not bought. As we communicate the value of our products, we know that the strong brand alone is not enough. We must paint a better picture of how our products help address the gap that people face, even when they have major medical insurance. Knowing our products help lift people up when they need us most is something that makes all of us at Aflac very proud and propels us to do more and achieve more.We continue to reinforce our leading position and build on that momentum. We are confident that the successful execution of our strategy will lead to sales of at least $1.8 billion in the U.S. by the end of 2025.I'd like to end on addressing our ongoing commitment to prudent liquidity and capital management. We have taken proactive steps in recent years to defend our cash flow and deployable capital against a weakening yen.At the end of 2023, we had nearly $2.8 billion of liquidity at the holding company, which was more than $1 billion over the minimum balance.As an insurance company, our primary responsibility is to fulfill the promises we make to our policyholders while being responsive to the needs of our shareholders. We remain committed to maintaining strong capital ratios on behalf of our policyholders and balance this financial strength with the tactical capital deployment. We intend to continue prudently managing our liquidity and capital to preserve the strength of our capital and cash flows. This supports both the dividend track record and the tactical share repurchase.2023 marked the 41st consecutive year of dividend increases.We treasure our track record of dividend growth and remain committed to extending it. Last quarter, the Board put us on a path to continue this record when it increased the first quarter of 2024 dividend, 19% to $0.50. We also remain in the market repurchasing our shares through 2023 at a historically high level of $700 million per quarter. We have remained tactical in our approach to share repurchase, deploying $2.8 billion in capital to repurchase nearly $39 million of our shares in 2023. Combined with dividend, this means we delivered over $3.8 billion back to the shareholders in 2023, while also investing in the growth of our business.At the same time, we have maintained our position among companies with the highest return on capital and the lowest cost of capital in the industry.Overall, I think we can say it's been another strong year.I'll now turn the program over to Max, who will cover more details of the financial results for this year and provide an outlook for the key drivers of earnings in 2024. Max?"", 'Max Kristian Broden', ""Thank you, Dan. This morning, I'm going to address our 2023 results before providing an outlook for certain drivers for 2024 that were included in the slides with our earnings materials filed yesterday with our 8-K.Aflac Incorporated delivered very strong earnings for the year as adjusted earnings per diluted share rose 9.9% to $6.23, the highest amount in our company's history. This result included a $0.19 negative impact from foreign currency and variable investment income was $0.14 per share below our long-term return expectations.In addition, our annual results included remeasurement gains of $0.51 per share, a $0.20 per share noneconomic loss in the fourth quarter under U.S. GAAP related to the innovation of a reinsurance treaty with a third party seeded back to the company, and a $0.04 per share write-off of certain capitalized software development costs in the third quarter.Our liquidity remains strong with unencumbered holding company liquidity being $1 billion above our minimum balance. Likewise, our capital position remains strong and we ended the year with an SMR above 1,100% in Japan.At the end of 2023, we estimated our internally modeled ESR to be above 250% and we expect the FSA to provide final guidance on the ESR later in 2024. We also estimated our combined RBC in the U.S. to be greater than 650% at the end of 2023. These are strong capital ratios, which we actively monitor, stress and manage to extend credit cycles as well as external shocks.In addition, impairments have remained within our expectations and with limited impact to both earnings and capital.Our adjusted leverage remains below our leverage corridor of 20% to 25% at 19.7%. And this will fluctuate with the yen dollar rate, since we hold approximately 2/3 of our debt denominated in yen as part of our enterprise hedging program to protect the economic value of Aflac Japan in U.S. dollar terms.In 2023, we repurchased $2.8 billion of our own stock and paid a dividend of $245 million in Q4, offering good relative IRR on these capital deployments.We will continue to be flexible and tactical in how we manage the balance sheet and deploy capital to drive strong risk-adjusted ROE with a meaningful spread to our cost of capital.Adjusted book value per share increased 10.1% and the adjusted ROE was 13.8%, an acceptable spread to our cost of capital. I'm also pleased with our continued development of our Bermuda reinsurance platform, which resulted in 3 transactions during 2023. We will continue to utilize this platform to better manage risk and improve the capital efficiency across the enterprise. And we expect these transactions to be part of a serious that will improve our run rate adjusted ROE by 100 to 200 basis points over time, all things being equal.Overall, we are very pleased with these results, especially when normalizing for onetime items.Turning to Aflac Japan. Its total benefit ratio for the year was 66%, down 140 basis points from the prior year. Throughout the year, we continue to experience favorable actual to expected on our well-priced large and mature in-force block. We estimate the impact from remeasurement gains to be 130 basis points favorable to the benefit ratio in 2023.Long-term experience trends, as it relates to treatment of cancer and hospitalization have continued to lead to favorable underwriting experience. Persistency remained solid with a rate of 93.4% and was down 70 basis points year-over-year, reflecting elevated lapse as customers updated their cancer and medical coverage with our latest cancer and medical products.Our expense ratio in Japan was 19.8%, down 50 basis points year-over-year, driven primarily by good expense control and to some extent, by expense allowance from reinsurance transactions.For the full year, total adjusted revenues in yen were down 3.6% to JPY 1.5 trillion. Net earned premiums declined 5.9% to JPY 1.1 trillion, reflecting the impact of reinsurance transactions, paid up policies and deferred profit liability.When excluding these 3 factors, net earned premiums declined an estimated 1.7%. On this same basis, we would expect net earned premiums in 2024 to decline 2.5% to 1.5%. When taking into consideration, the impact of reinsurance, paid-up policies and the deferred profit liability reclassification.Adjusted net investment income increased 4% to JPY 365.6 billion, as we experienced higher yields on our U.S. dollar-denominated investments and related favorable FX. This was partially offset by transfer of assets due to reinsurance. Pretax earnings were JPY 456.9 billion or 6% higher than a year ago.For 2024, we would expect our well-priced in-force to show greater stability in terms of the benefit ratio, excluding unlockings and to be in the range of 66% to 68%. This is a function of both favorable morbidity experience and improved mix of business.With the current trend in revenues, we're actively reducing our expenses. We are taking both tactical efforts as well as more long-term transformational initiatives, and we would expect our expense ratio to be in the range of 19% to 21% going forward.The pretax profit margin for Japan for 2023 was 30.5%, up 280 basis points year-over-year, a very good result. With approximately 30% of the Japan portfolio in U.S. dollar assets, the strength of the U.S. dollar versus the yen has increased the proportion of net investment income as a component of our pretax profit. With a greater contribution to profitability from net investment income in yen terms, our pretax margin is naturally pushed up. In addition, having transitioned to option-based currency hedging, we expect quarterly hedge costs to remain roughly in line with what we experienced in the fourth quarter of 2023. In combination with a lower expected benefit ratio, we expect a pretax profit margin of 29% to 31% in 2024.Turning to Aflac U.S. Our 2023 total benefit ratio came in well below expectations at 42.8%. We estimate that the remeasurement gains impacted the benefit ratio by 500 basis points in 2023. Claims utilization has stabilized. But as we incorporate more recent experience into our reserve models, we unlocked assumptions and released reserves during the year.Persistency increased 130 basis points year-over-year to 78.6%. This is a function of poor persistency quarters following out of the metric and stabilization across numerous product categories.Our expense ratio in the U.S. was 40.6%, up 90 basis points year-over-year, primarily driven by our growth initiatives and higher DAC amortization. We would expect the U.S. expense ratio to decrease over time as these businesses grow to scale and improve their profitability.For the full year, total adjusted revenues were up 2.1% to $6.6 billion. Net earned premiums increased 1.9% to $5.7 billion in 2023. Adjusted net investment income increased 8.6% to $820 million, mainly driven by higher yields on both our fixed and floating rate portfolios.Pretax earnings were $1.5 billion or 10.4% higher than a year ago, driven primarily by the lower benefit ratio, which was largely impacted by the third quarter unlock and only partially offset by the higher expense ratio.For 2024, we would expect net earned premium growth to be in the range of 3% to 5%.Profitability for the U.S. segment was solid, with a pretax margin of 22.7%, driven primarily by the remeasurement gains from unlocking.Looking forward at 2024, as we grow products with a higher benefit ratio and lower expense ratio, like group life and disability and network dental and vision, you should start to see those changes reflected in our ratios over time. In 2024, we would expect to operate with a benefit ratio in the range of 45% to 47%, and an expense ratio of 38% to 40%. This translates into an expected profit margin of 19% to 21%.In our Corporate segment, we recorded a pretax loss of $425 million, compared to a loss of $218 million a year ago, primarily due to higher investment tax credits and the impact of the innovation of our reinsurance treaty with a third party.Adjusted net investment income was $54 million lower than last year due to an increased volume of tax credit investments. Higher rates began to earn in and amortized hedge income increased. This tax credit investments impacted the corporate net investment income line for U.S. GAAP purposes negatively by $343 million, with an associated credit to the tax line.The net impact to our bottom line was a positive $39 million. To date, these investments are performing well and in line with expectations. The impact from the reinsurance innovation was a onetime negative of $151 million.Overall, we are very pleased with our 2023 results and our outlook for 2024. I'll now turn the call back to David, so we can begin Q&A. David?"", 'David Young', 'Thank you, Max. (Operator Instructions) Betsy, we will now take the first question.', 'Operator', '(Operator Instructions) The first question today comes from Tom Gallagher with Evercore ISI.', 'Thomas George Gallagher', ""One numbers question and then one on strategy.Just the numbers question. I guess for the last several years, you've had better portfolio yield in Japan being driven by to pivot into USD portfolio. If I look at the last couple of quarters, that seems to be flattening out. So your portfolio yield has been more stable. Can you talk about what's driving that and what it means for 2024 NII in Japan? And then, Dan, strategy question is, just given the growth headwinds in Japan, would you guys consider anything more meaningful on M&A strategically to help facilitate growth? I know you haven't really done this in the past, but there does seem to be an element of kind of unavoidable demographic headwind in Japan that you're fighting against here. So curious what you think on strategy there."", 'Max Kristian Broden', ""I'll kick it off and then hand over to Brad and then to Dan for the strategy question.As it relates to our investment portfolio and net investment income, you're correct in noticing that our net investment income has increased over the last couple of years. A portion of that is driven by our increased allocation to U.S. dollar assets. And I do want to remind you that, that is primarily driven by the view that we have of hedging our economic exposure to the yen as it relates to the overall exposure that we have as a company to the yen throughout like Japan.We have now reached what we view to be more of a steady state as it relates to our total U.S. dollar allocation. So from that level, I would expect a stabilization in terms of our total allocation between yen and dollars within the investment portfolio.But as it relates to more of an outlook into 2024 for our NII, I'll turn to Brad and he can give you some more color."", 'Bradley Eugene Dyslin', 'Yes. The only thing I would add is just to remind you that our new money yield is both a blend of lower yen rates as well as the higher U.S. dollar rates. Most of our deployment is planned for U.S. dollar assets and that is to maintain the balances, as Max just described. But we do still like yen spread products when we can locate acceptable outlets. When that happens, then we will put them in the portfolio and that does result in pulling down the overall reported new money yield just because of the simple math of lower yen rates.', 'Daniel Paul Amos', ""And Tom, in regards to strategy, that's been an issue we've had for several years. We feel like that one of the things we are addressing (technical difficulty) cancer or medical product to it by starting them off on an inexpensive savings plan that gets them to participate with us.We also continue to look for new product. We have still not found that third product or third leg that we want to find. And we're continuing to try things.But I don't know of anyone right now that I would trade places within Japan in terms of distribution and product that we have and believe we can continue to grow our business moving forward. Saying that, we have to be realistic that it is an aging population and it also is a position where it's not the population is declining.But all in all, I still believe it's the best market in the country or in the world because of the persistency and our ability to continue to grow it. And so I think you're going to see growth for the next several years. We did lower that number to -- from JPY 80 billion just to be cautious, but we're encouraged.Our Japan Post growth and what's gone there continues to do very well, and we've enjoyed our relationship there. It's our existing distribution system that was really hurt, both in the U.S. and Japan, by COVID, but more so in Japan because if you look back at COVID, it really lasted an additional year in Japan. And because our agents are commission-driven, our newer agents, when COVID hit, all of a sudden did not have an opportunity to go out and sell one-on-one. And as we've always said, our products are sold, they're not bought. And so we go out and make those presentations, and we couldn't do it.And so people that were normally working for us on a commission basis tried to find other jobs that were salary in nature and that's what we've been fighting, but it is coming back both in the U.S. and Japan, and I'm encouraged by what I'm seeing there."", 'Operator', 'The next question comes from Suneet Kamath with Jefferies.', 'Suneet Laxman L. Kamath', ""Just a couple on Japan. And the first one, Dan, just gets back to something you're just talking about in terms of the JPY 67 billion to JPY 73 billion sort of target down from the JPY 80 billion. Are you viewing that as sort of just a delay? And that, that JPY 80 billion is ultimately achievable, maybe a year beyond your original target? Just -- I wanted to think about it a little bit longer term."", 'Daniel Paul Amos', ""Well, I certainly think it's the potential out there. I don't know what year because the COVID with such an anomaly, what I'd like to do is to let our people that are there on the -- Koide or whoever wants to take this particular question can do it. And then I'll follow up if there's any other part you want me to directly address."", 'Masatoshi Koide', ""Yes. This is Koide, Aflac Japan.[Interpreted] So let me answer the question.And the reason why we've changed our target from JPY 80 billion to JPY 67 billion to JPY 73 billion was because we knew that it would take a longer time. So we do think that we are able to achieve JPY 80 billion if we look beyond 2026 or after."", 'Suneet Laxman L. Kamath', ""Got it. Okay. All right. And then I just had another question on, I guess, persistency in Japan. If I just think back to Aflac from years ago, it strikes me that part of the reason the persistency was so strong is because you sold at the work site and there just was very little job mobility in Japan so people just kept the products for a long time. And I guess the question is, as you're shifting now to new distribution channels outside of the work site and to a younger population, which seems to be the objective, should we just expect a natural decline in that persistency over time?"", 'Max Kristian Broden', ""I'll kick it off and I'll let anybody add some commentary to that as well. As we sell to younger customers, that should actually improve the persistency because of the age-based pricing that we have in Japan, there's a very strong incentive to hold on to the product for a long time and maybe even for life. So as you sell into a younger population, that tends to reduce your lapse rates and improve your persistency.Suneet, you are correct to -- when you look at the corporate agencies that you are referring to from the past that, that was -- had very strong persistency overall in that channel. And as that has become a smaller piece of our overall inforce, that have structurally reduced our persistency.The other thing I would mention as well is that we have seen an aging of the block. And when you have an aging of the block, that naturally leads to higher lapsation and lower persistency as well. So you hear us talk about that we are trying to reach younger customers, that is partially to sort of fight these sort of long-term trends that we have going on in our inforce block to not only provide coverage and new coverages to the younger population, but also to improve the overall persistency of the block.All of this is marginal from year-to-year, and it's very slow moving, but it's certainly something that we're watching closely."", 'Daniel Paul Amos', ""Yoshizumi, do you have any comments you'd like to add? Our head of sales in Japan."", 'Koichiro Yoshizumi', '[Interpreted] This is Yoshizumi. And regarding the persistency that was just asked and answered by Max, and as Max answered, by us focusing on young and middle-aged customers, our persistency is going to be higher, and that is our strategy. And that is actually represented by the medical insurance that was just launched on September 19.And this product is very popular among the young and middle-aged customers whose ages are under 49 or 49 and under.In terms of the number of policy count that we sold to these young and middle-aged customers, we actually saw a 46% increase year-on-year from the time that we launched in September to the end of the year last year. And these customers are for our middle and long-term growth of Aflac Japan, and these are the customers who will be our assets and our treasure going forward.And the actual premiums that are being paid by young and middle-aged customers are lower. And we truly believe that by focusing on these younger customers and increasing these young customers would contribute to stable growth of our company. And at the same time, as I mentioned, the persistency rate will be higher and this is our strategy.', 'Daniel Paul Amos', ""I just want to remind you all that the persistency rate is really high. And we can move it up a little bit, move down a little bit, but it is more than we ever dreamed when we first started doing business over there. So we're very pleased with it. So -- but at the same time, we will improve because when you're writing younger people, of course, they'll live longer, and therefore, will be more persistent."", 'Operator', 'The next question comes from Jimmy Bhullar with JPMorgan.', 'Jamminder Singh Bhullar', ""So first, a question on Japan. And if you think really long term, is it even realistic to assume that the business can grow given that the population shrinking, the population is aging as well? And then versus 10, 20 years ago, there are a lot more companies in the product lines that you're in? So if you could just comment on that, like -- and maybe on your -- the reduction in guidance on sales, how much of that has to do with just Japan taking longer to recover from COVID versus some of these demographic headwinds?"", 'Daniel Paul Amos', ""Well, my first comment is, you're correct in terms of a competitive environment. But what is in Japan or any other country that isn't competitive. So being competitive is nothing new to us, and something that we are understanding that we have to constantly look for ways to address how we can identify with consumers and show the need for our products even more.Now don't forget, we've seen copays and deductibles over many years. I don't know when another one will take place or what will happen. But as inflation, even though small in Japan, you have to take that into account, too. So remember, our ability to convert and add more premium to existing policyholders always makes a difference and grows our block of business as well, and we especially think that with the younger people. Let me now turn to Japan and let them comment on it."", 'Masatoshi Koide', ""Yes. This is Koide, Aflac Japan.[Interpreted] And it is true that Japan is being projected as having declining population. But at the same time, with the advancement of longevity in the 100-year life era, the need to prepare for longevity risk is expected to increase steadily.And it's also expected that the aging population could increase the medical cost because as you live long, the probability of suffering from cancer and other diseases will increase.And in Japan, the sustainability of the overall social security system is being discussed. And this would also include medical and nursing care. And this is being questioned, and the discussions are underway within the Japanese government to review how the benefits and burden should be balanced.And given these circumstances, there is a way of thinking about helping themselves or self-help and preparing for the future as people become more aware of the situation. And as a result, although the population may decline, we do think that the third sector market will steadily grow going forward as well."", 'Jamminder Singh Bhullar', 'Okay. And then on the U.S. business, do you have a better clarity on the tri-agency rule and its potential impact on your sales?', 'Virgil Raynard Miller', ""This is Virgil, good morning from the U.S. We have been working with the tri-agency sales to talk about any potential impact we could see to those selling supplemental into the consumers out there. And we're waiting on a ruling. Thus far, they set a date to be on April 2024, you know and I know that a date may move. However, we remain encouraged that our policies and coverages are relevant regardless if that rule does come through.We looked at our (inaudible) sales from last year. We really didn't see any decline. We remain flat there. And again, regardless, even if there is a rule or not a rule, our coverage is relevant and we're not predicting any major impact going forward."", 'Operator', 'The next question comes from Wilma Burdis with Raymond James.', 'Wilma Carter Jackson Burdis', 'Could you talk a little bit about the outlook for capital generation, and if we should expect anything on an ongoing basis from internal reinsurance opportunities?', 'Max Kristian Broden', ""Wilma, if you think about the total capital generation that we've had recently and also going into 2024, I don't see any significant change to our overall capital generation on an organic basis. That remains in the $2.6 billion to $3 billion range. On top of that, we know that we have opportunities that we can overtime unlock more capital through utilizing our reinsurance platform, and we intend to do so. We can't necessarily predict exactly when that will happen or what amounts that will be, but you've seen us in the recent past be quite active on that front. So I would expect us to do more. But on a pure, sort of run rate organic basis, I would have pegged our underlying capital generation at $2.6 billion to $3 billion annually."", 'Wilma Carter Jackson Burdis', ""And could you just talk more about the commercial real estate watch list? It's higher than a lot of the peers, and you guys have taken the key back on a few properties lately. So if you could go into that and what you're seeing there?"", 'Unidentified Company Representative', ""Sure. I think there's one primary thing related to our watch list relative to our portfolio that makes us different than peers, and that's the fact that the bulk of our exposure is in transitional real estate. Remember, that's a much shorter asset class. It's a much shorter maturity, generally a 3-year term with some options to extend out a fourth and fifth year.So because of that, when you have a market downturn and you've got these maturities coming due and the liquidity is as poor as we're seeing in the market today, it naturally creates an elevated watch list and creates an elevated amount of potential foreclosures. Now, we work very closely with our borrowers to address those maturities. We do our best to avoid foreclosure. But if they are not willing to work with us, if they're not willing to reset the loan to reflect current valuations and give us other protections, we are fortunate that we're in a position we can and will foreclose if we think that's the best route to maximize our recoveries. We are blessed with a strong capital and liquidity position, which prevents us from being a forced seller here. So I think it's a combination of the nature of our portfolio, having shorter maturities relative to our total exposure. And then the fact that we are much more willing to foreclose and able to foreclose, if we think that's the best route."", 'Operator', 'The next question comes from Elyse Greenspan with Wells Fargo.', 'Elyse Beth Greenspan', ""My first question, going back to just Japan sales guidance. Dan, I know you said you guys are being cautious in lowering the outlook there. But how do we think about -- how should we think about going from the JPY 60.7 billion of sales in '23 to the new JPY 67 billion to JPY 73 billion target? Should we think about that being even -- even over the next few years or maybe a bit more back-ended?"", 'Daniel Paul Amos', ""Japan? Okay. Well, we at this particular time are just evaluating what we think might happen for the next 2 years. And frankly, we've just tried to be conservative and give us some latitude on what would happen. But we have some very positive things coming out in 2024 that we think will drive sales and are encouraged about it and even some things as we're looking to 2025 that will be coming.Let me make sure that Koide or -- they don't want to make any comments in that regard. Koide?"", 'Koichiro Yoshizumi', 'Yes. This is Yoshizumi.', 'Daniel Paul Amos', 'Okay, Yoshizumi.', 'Koichiro Yoshizumi', ""[Interpreted] Okay. Let me answer the question.And as Dan mentioned earlier, it is true that COVID has impacted Japan way beyond our expectation. And as a result, the number of solicitors or sales agents have decreased significantly. And even if you were -- even if our agencies are able to hire the sales agents, we were not able to train them.It was not until May last year in Japan that COVID has been reclassified at the same level as with influenza. So we had no choice, but faced really truly difficult situation in sales for a long time. And at the same time, it is also true that it took us quite a bit of time to train those sales agents that have lower skill. But right now, what we are very much focused on is to really recruit and train that the solicitors or sales agents. Otherwise, we will not be able to train and grow those sales agents that are customer-centric.Aflac sales agents must be those agents that are very welcomed by our customers. What I mean by that is that those sales agents must respond to customers' needs when they solicit policies, but at the same time, when the benefits and claims are paid. And I do believe that it is Aflac's mission to send out these kind of sales agents to the market appropriately. And that is the reason why we have set our sales target relatively conservative. And we currently do have recruiting and development and training plan for our future, as Koide mentioned earlier, beyond maybe JPY 80 billion or even more in the future."", 'Max Kristian Broden', 'Elyse, I would think about the sales trajectory as being relatively linear, i.e., not back-end loaded.', 'Elyse Beth Greenspan', ""That's helpful, Max. And then my second question, you guys you pointed out, you obviously have a good amount of buffer at the holdco relative to where you've talked about running. How do you think about, I guess, managing that down? And how should we think about the level of potential buybacks in '24?"", 'Max Kristian Broden', ""So we're obviously operating with a very significant capital levels in all of our subsidiaries at the moment. Over time, I would expect us to operate at slightly lower capital levels in terms of the ratios than where we are today.I would reflect that in Japan, we are now going through a transition from SMR to ESR. So I wouldn't necessarily make any dramatic changes ahead of that. In the U.S., we are looking to, over time, target in an RBC of closer to 400%, and we have active plans towards drawing that down.At the same time, we have strong capital and liquidity at the holding companies. We always think about where is capital serving us the best at that very point in time, at the same time, making sure that we have capital available for deployment into dividends, buybacks, et cetera. So overall, I would say that our capital plans remain solid. We've got plenty of capital around, and we try to place it where it makes the best use."", 'Operator', 'Your next question comes from John B. Barnidge from Piper Sandler.', 'John Bakewell Barnidge', 'I had a question of going back to the Japan sales target. I know you put out a press release in December about the Trupanion pet insurance partnership for Japan. Did that pivot remove any sales contribution from the JPY 80 billion assumption? And can you talk...', 'Daniel Paul Amos', 'No, it did not.', 'John Bakewell Barnidge', 'Okay. Then can you maybe talk about the growth opportunity for that product in the U.S. that was called out in the pivot and commitment to ownership stake?', 'Max Kristian Broden', ""Pet insurance, we think, has a significant opportunity in the U.S. market because of the very low penetration of the product itself.For Aflac, we act as a distributor where these premiums, claims, et cetera, do not hit our income statement. So it's an opportunity to -- for our distribution to earn additional commissions, so in that sense, it's very positive to Aflac.We do, obviously, have an alliance and a partnership with Trupanion that is strong through the equity ownership that we have in the company, and we capture significant economics over time through that equity ownership."", 'Operator', 'Your next question comes from Joel Hurwitz with Dowling & Partners.', 'Joel Hurwitz', ""First, a question on U.S. expenses. So the outlook looks to be largely in line with prior year. You've talked in the past on bending the expense curve and getting closer to a mid-30% expense ratio. Can you just provide an update on those expectations and when we should start to see a more significant drop in the expense ratio in the U.S.?"", 'Max Kristian Broden', 'So you are starting to see a drop in 2024, and I would expect that to continue. There are 2 forces at play here, both expenses and our revenues. Expenses, we have active plans to improve our expense efficiency and reduce expenses, both from a tactical and transformational standpoint. But also do not disregard the impact from revenues here. So as we have a number of businesses that are not at scale today, they will grow to scale. And when they do that, their expense ratios will drop significantly, and that will improve overall our expense ratio, i.e., push that down.The last piece to all of this is also where is our future growth coming from. It is generally coming from low expense ratio businesses. Predominantly, the group life and disability business that operates at a significantly lower structural expense ratio than the voluntary benefits business.So if you take all of that together, we should have a trajectory that is going lower and we would expect to operate in the 35% to 37% over time.', 'Joel Hurwitz', 'Okay. Makes sense. And then just on the recapture. Any color on the economic benefit? And then are there other blocks that you could potentially execute something similar on?', 'Max Kristian Broden', ""So overall, we're very pleased with the economics. The -- in terms of the impact on future run rate results, they're relatively small, but they're obviously favorable. So there's a favorable run rate going forward. In terms of the other blocks out there, I do deem that this is -- was the one that we really had out there. I wish we had more than we could do, but this was really the one that we had outstanding."", 'Operator', 'The next question comes from Ryan Krueger with KBW.', 'Ryan Joel Krueger', 'First, I just wanted to follow up on the U.S. expense ratio, given that the group products also tend to have higher benefit ratio. So just curious, as you continue -- as you do grow those business lines and the expense ratio comes down, would you expect, ultimately, for the margins in the U.S. is to increase? Or to what extent would that be offset by naturally higher benefit ratios on those products?', 'Max Kristian Broden', ""So I think that we have been in a structurally low benefit ratio period, which means that over time, I would expect our benefit ratios to increase. And you're right, Ryan, to acknowledge that the mix impact will also push our benefit ratios higher. So we're always going to see that mix impact, impacting both expense ratio and benefit ratios going forward. And that will have a slightly negative impact to the pretax margin going forward because of mix.I'll kick it over to Virgil Miller to give his comments as well."", 'Virgil Raynard Miller', ""So first, we're not pleased where we sit with the expense ratio. That is absolutely a focus for the U.S. And one of the things we're doing is making sure we have plans that are going to continue to be in that curve, and you'll see that happening over a period of time. And we're basically challenging all of the U.S. leadership to be accountable for that, and it is tied to our little compensation. Now I'll go step further, though, I mentioned that when we talked about the actual sales growth this year, one of the things we mentioned -- you heard Dan mention earlier, is our strong underwriting discipline. We are making sure that we only put policies and business on the books that actually have better persistency and lower turnover rates with employees.So the underwriting discipline itself will continue to help drive and bend that expense curve and drive up that benefit ratio, along with, as Max mentioned, the continued growth that we're seeing on (inaudible), it would change the overall business mix in the U.S. So just to conclude, it is absolutely a focus for us and that we are confident we've got the right plans in place to start bidding that curve starting next year."", 'Ryan Joel Krueger', ""And then on Japan internal reinsurance, you've done a transaction 2 years in a row. Is there any practical limitation on doing something like that kind of pretty regularly? Or is there anything that would commit your ability to do that?"", 'Max Kristian Broden', ""So Ryan, over time, we would expect that we could see at about 10% of the Aflac Japan balance sheet to Aflac Bermuda. There are no real legal limitations to it, but at the same time, we got to acknowledge any sort of risks associated with internal reinsurance to make sure that we don't overexpose ourselves or we make sure that we can handle everything associated with it. So over time, I would expect us to see something like 10%. And to date, we have done about 4%."", 'Virgil Raynard Miller', 'And this is Virgil. Let me just go back to add, when I was talking about being on that curve, that starts this year, in 2024. I just want to make sure you got that. I said next year, but I mean 2024.', 'Operator', 'The next question comes from Josh Shanker with Bank of America.', 'Joshua David Shanker', 'Just a question as to whether or not the yen at JPY 140, JPY 150 to the dollar versus [110], does that change your hedging costs, your desire to hedge the strategy at all in your investment portfolio?', 'Unidentified Company Representative', ""So obviously, the pricing of options will move and that impacts to some extent, the cost of hedging. And so obviously, every input that you would have to the pricing of options would impact that. In terms of the level of the yen, the answer is no. We want to structurally protect the economic exposure we have to the yen. And we do that through the dollar allocation that we have in the general account. We do that through the debt that we issue in yen, and we do that through the forwards that we hold at the holding company, where we are long dollars, short yen. So overall, we do this in order to reduce risk, not necessarily to express an opinion on the yen. Now, how we hedge and protect ourselves, we have all these different levers that we can pull, and the cost and return on capital associated with those can vary over time because of the capital markets. So that's why we will then dial up and dial down some of those associated with that. But it's not necessarily associated with the level of the yen-dollar rate. We are not FX traders. We're looking to protect ourselves long term."", 'Operator', 'This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to David Young for any closing remarks.', 'David Young', 'Thank you, Betsy, and thank you all for joining us this morning.

Pepsi is also working with Khaby Lame, the most popular TikToker, for on-the-ground experiences and social content in the ramp-up to the big game on Feb. 11.', 'Pepsi at the same time is catering to people who prefer a low-key night in through a Wild Cherry Hotline that fans in select cities can message for the chance to win products like a branded robe.

On the one hand, the brand is embracing the “wild” reputation of Vegas through outsized activations, including a Sphere takeover and partnerships with top social media stars. On the other, Pepsi Wild Cherry’s new “Get Wild” campaign is targeted at aging millennials who maybe don’t have the energy for a trip to the Strip — or even a Super Bowl party — anymore, hence a hotline rewarding people who are tuning into the match-up between the Kansas City Chiefs and San Francisco 49ers from the comfort of their home.', 'Other marketers are taking advantage of Vegas’ glitz and glam image through culinary experiences and even a tech developer-style conference around Super Bowl weekend. Pepsi has gotten a jump on interest in the Sphere through the work with King, whose elaborately staged videos are meant to feel like a Vegas magic show translated to the TikTok era. In new ads running on King and Pepsi’s social channels, the creator uses perspective tricks and clever editing to take a sip from the top of the Sphere, draining it of soda, and drop brightly colored cherries into the dome-like venue that has become a magnet for advertisers.', 'PepsiCo earlier this week struck a deal to become an official partner of the Sphere, providing food and beverages at concession stands and opening fresh opportunities to be featured on the Exosphere, the glittering, LED-lit shell of the building that doubles as a skyline-dominating billboard. The pact expands PepsiCo’s existing relationship with the MSG Family of Companies.', 'Top TikToker Lame will also attend his first Super Bowl courtesy of Pepsi, with plans to meet with the Pepsi Rookie of the Year winner, tailgate with Guy Fieri and hang out with Shaquille O’Neal at a branded diner. Lame, whose silent reaction videos and signature shrug have led to viral fame, previously starred in a campaign for Pepsi’s Nitro cola.', 'Those steering clear of crowds in Vegas, Kansas City and San Francisco around the Super Bowl can text “WILDNIGHTIN” to the Wild Cherry Hotline at (844) 833-9215.

These non-GAAP financial measures are computed by excluding certain non-cash and/or other items from the related GAAP financial measure. The Company also includes a non-GAAP adjustment for the estimated income tax effect of reconciling items. A reconciliation of the Company's GAAP to non-GAAP results is included in Table 3 of this press release.The Company makes such adjustments for items the Company does not view as useful in evaluating its operating performance. For example, adjustments may be made for items that fluctuate from period to period based on factors that are not within the Company's control (such as the Company's stock price on the dates share-based grants are issued or changes in the fair value of the Company's investments in equity securities) or items that are not associated with normal, recurring operations (such as acquisition and integration costs). Management uses these non-GAAP measures for planning, budgeting, forecasting, assessing historical performance, and making financial and operational decisions, and also provides forecasts to investors on this basis. With respect to free cash flows, the Company believes that this non-GAAP measure provides a further measure of the Company’s operations' ability to generate cash flows. Additionally, such non-GAAP measures provide investors with an enhanced understanding of the financial performance of the Company's core business operations. However, there are limitations in the use of these and other non-GAAP financial measures as they exclude certain expenses that are recurring in nature. Furthermore, the Company's non-GAAP financial measures may not be comparable with non-GAAP information provided by other companies.

Linvoseltamab is an investigational bispecific antibody designed to bridge B-cell maturation antigen (BCMA) on multiple myeloma cells with CD3-expressing T cells to facilitate T-cell activation and cancer-cell killing.', 'The MAA is supported by data from a Phase 1/2 pivotal trial (LINKER-MM1) investigating linvoseltamab in R/R MM, which were last shared in December 2023. A Biologics License Application (BLA) was also submitted to the FDA in December 2023.', 'As the second most common blood cancer, there are over 176,000 new cases of MM diagnosed globally every year. It is characterized by the proliferation of cancerous plasma cells (MM cells) that crowd out healthy blood cells in the bone marrow, infiltrate other tissues and cause potentially life-threatening organ injury. MM is not curable despite treatment advances. While current treatments are able to slow the progression of the cancer, most patients will ultimately experience disease progression and require additional therapies.', 'The linvoseltamab clinical development program includes a Phase 3 confirmatory trial (LINKER-MM3) that is currently enrolling. Additional trials in earlier lines of therapy and stages of disease are planned or underway, including a Phase 1/2 trial in the first-line setting, a Phase 2 trial in high-risk smoldering MM and a Phase 2 trial in monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance. A Phase 1 trial of linvoseltamab in combination with a CD38xCD28 costimulatory bispecific in MM is also planned. For more information, contact clinicaltrials@regeneron.com\xa0or 844-734-6643, or visit the Regeneron clinical trials\xa0website.', 'Linvoseltamab is currently under clinical development, and its safety and efficacy have not been fully evaluated by any regulatory authority.', 'About the Phase 1/2 TrialThe ongoing, open-label, multicenter Phase 1/2 dose-escalation and dose-expansion LINKER-MM1 trial is investigating linvoseltamab in patients with R/R MM. Among 282 patients enrolled, all received at least three prior lines of therapy or were triple refractory. Linvoseltamab was administered with an initial step-up dosing regimen followed by the full dose. Additionally, a response-adapted administration schedule enabled patients who achieved a very good partial response or a complete response to shift from every two-week to every-four-week dosing after a minimum of 24 weeks of therapy.', 'The Phase 1 intravenous dose-escalation portion of the trial, which is now complete, primarily assessed safety, tolerability and dose-limiting toxicities across nine dose levels of linvoseltamab exploring different administration regimens. The Phase 2 dose expansion portion is assessing the safety and anti-tumor activity of linvoseltamab, with a primary objective of objective response rate. Key secondary objectives include duration of response, progression free survival, rate of minimal residual disease negative status and overall survival.', 'About Regeneron in HematologyAt Regeneron, we’re applying more than three decades of biology expertise with our proprietary\xa0VelociSuite®\xa0technologies to develop medicines for patients with diverse blood cancers and rare blood disorders.', 'Our blood cancer research is focused on bispecific antibodies that are being investigated both as monotherapies and in various combinations and emerging therapeutic modalities.

For the full year 2023, we delivered strong revenue growth of 7% in our base business and delivered on our earnings commitment as we transitioned away from COVID testing. The results we announced this morning reflect a strong fourth quarter and full year for our base business in which we made substantial progress on our strategy to drive top line growth across our core customer channels and improve profitability. Throughout the year, we advanced our growth strategy with innovative testing solutions, new and expanded relationships with health systems and a robust pipeline of M&A and professional lab services opportunities. We also delivered double-digit revenue growth in several clinical areas, including advanced cardiometabolic, prenatal and hereditary genetics and neurology. We also strengthened our oncology offering with a strategic investment in higher growth, minimal residual disease testing. In addition, our efforts to improve quality and productivity delivered our Invigorate goal which helped us offset the cost headwinds we faced throughout the year. This morning, we issued guidance for 2024 that reflects a return to overall revenue growth while balancing the earnings tailwinds and headwinds we see for the year. Looking beyond 2024, we are well positioned to deliver our long-term financial outlook to drive mid-single-digit revenue growth and high single-digit earnings growth. I'm grateful to our dedicated Quest colleagues for making this happen. Every day, they bring our purpose to life, working together to create a healthier world, one life at a time.Before discussing highlights from 2023, I'd like to share some recent regulatory updates. First, as you know, Congress once again delayed Medicare reimbursement cuts and the next data collection process under PAMA that were scheduled to take place in 2024. While we are pleased with the delay, we continue to work closely with our trade association to seek a permanent fix to PAMA through SALSA, the Saving Access to Laboratory Services Act. ACLA's highest priority this year is to secure passage of SALSA.Second, ACLA and nearly 7,000 other individuals and groups submitted comments last quarter on a rule proposed by the FDA to regulate laboratory developed tests as medical devices. Lab developed tests are essential medical innovations that are already highly regulated under federal legislation known as CLIA, in addition to the oversight by states, accredited bodies and Medicare as it makes coverage determinations. If enacted, the FDA's proposed rule would compromise patient access to a central lab testing. It would also slow diagnostic innovation and add unnecessary health care costs. We agree with ACLA that the FDA does not have the statutory authority to unilaterally regulate LDTs and believe that resuming discussions with the FDA, Congress, ACLA and other stakeholders on a legislative solution is the most prudent path forward. Now I'll recap our strategy and discuss highlights from the fourth quarter. Then Sam will provide more detail on our financial results and talk about our financial guidance for 2024. Our strategy to drive growth is focused on delivering solutions that meet the evolving needs of our core customers: physicians, hospitals and consumers. We enable growth across our customer channels through advanced diagnostics with an intense focus on faster-growing clinical areas, including molecular genomics and oncology. In addition, acquisitions are a key growth driver with an emphasis on accretive hospital outreach purchases as well as smaller independent labs. Our strategy also includes driving operational improvements across the business with strategic deployment of automation and AI to improve quality, efficiency, workforce experience and service. Here are some updates on the progress we have made in these areas in the fourth quarter. In physician lab services, we delivered mid-single-digit base business revenue growth. We attribute this growth to return to care, overall market growth and share gains driven by the competitive strengths of our scale and innovative offerings. We continue to execute hospital outreach and independent lab acquisitions, which generate volume for our physician channel.In January, we entered into a definitive agreement to acquire select assets of Lenco, an independent New York-based laboratory company, and expect to complete the transaction later this quarter. In addition, we acquired outreach assets of Steward Health Care, which will deepen our reach to patients in Massachusetts, Pennsylvania and Ohio. As we said earlier, our acquisition pipeline is very strong, and we expect to complete additional transactions in 2024. Our strong relationships with health plans were also a key driver of growth in 2023 as we grew revenues from health plans by high single digits versus the prior year. As we've indicated, we successfully completed negotiations for all our strategic health plan renewals that were scheduled in 2023. Health plans and self-insured employer clients recognize the clinical and economic value we deliver to them and their members. To date, more than half of health plan revenues now come from value-based contracts, which enable faster growth compared to our traditional health plan contracts. In addition, working with health plans, we continue to reduce so-called lab leakage to high-cost out-of-network labs, partly by redirecting the volume to Quest. Importantly, this is good for both patients as well as employers, which pay for the majority of health care costs. In hospital lab services, we drove high single-digit base business revenue growth in the fourth quarter with strength in both reference and professional laboratory services. Hospital reference testing, in particular, grew much faster than historical trends and well above our estimated growth for the market. Increasingly, health systems recognize that our innovative laboratory testing and collaborative lab management solutions can help them improve quality, productivity, affordability and care. They also continue to face labor and cost pressures, prompting more of them to reach out to us to help with their lab strategy. Our professional lab services help manage a hospital's lab, supply chain and workforce. We also provide insights from our analytical solutions to help hospitals manage utilization to deliver the right test to the right patient at the right time. In the fourth quarter, we completed two PLS relationships that will contribute modest growth in the first quarter of this year. We also provide health systems the opportunity to transition their noncore outreach laboratory assets to us through acquisitions. By selling their outreach assets to Quest, these hospitals are better able to redeploy scarce capital to areas of their business that have a greater impact on patient care. Our consumer-initiated testing service, questhealth.com, generated revenues of approximately $45 million in the full year 2023, with strong base business growth. Our return on ad spend and customer acquisition costs remained favorable in the fourth quarter.Another element of our CIT strategy is to drive revenue growth through channel partners. In 2023, we generated more than $30 million through this channel. We are also excited about new product releases in 2024, including blood testing for PFAS or forever chemicals via questhealth.com. PFAS chemicals have been used in industrial and consumer products for decades and may contaminate food and water. In late January, the CDC issued new guidelines that recognize the value of PFAS blood testing for individuals that may have elevated exposure levels, which may increase risk of kidney cancer, high cholesterol and other health conditions. According to a study in the Journal of Endocrine Society, PFAS chemicals accounted for approximately $22 billion in U.S. health care costs in 2018.In advanced diagnostics, we experienced double-digit growth across several clinical areas in the fourth quarter, including advanced cardiometabolic, prenatal and hereditary genetics and neurology. Growth in neurology was driven largely by our Alzheimer's disease portfolio of tests which is among the most comprehensive in the fast-evolving field of Alzheimer's care. Our innovations include our AD-Detect blood test for early risk assessment based on amyloid beta proteins and ApoE genetic risks. This week, we also added p-tau181 to our AD-Detect blood test line to complement insights from amyloid beta testing. In addition, our Alzheimer's disease test portfolio includes several CSF tests for diagnosis and monitoring based on amyloid beta, p-tau181 and ApoE. We intend to add additional biomarkers later this year and continue to expand our menu. In molecular genomics and oncology, we are on track to launch our Haystack minimal residual disease test to physicians later this year from our Oncology Center of Excellence in Lewisville, Texas. We also believe Haystack MRD can help support clinical research and recently announced clinical trial collaborations using this innovative technology with the Rutgers Cancer Institute, Alliance Foundation Trials and TriSalus Life Sciences. In the fourth quarter, we announced a collaboration with Universal DX, which has developed an innovative blood test for screening for colorectal cancer, including precancerous lesions. We look forward to supporting Universal's effort to gain regulatory approval for this test. Through our collaboration with Scipher, we are expanding patient access to the PrismRA test for aiding treatment selection for rheumatoid arthritis. Turning to operational excellence. Our Invigorate program delivered our targeted 3% annual cost savings and productivity improvements. Here are three examples of how we're improving operations. First, we continue to make progress in using front-end automation to enhance specimen processing. In 2023, we completed front-end automation upgrades in our Pittsburgh and Dallas laboratories which will improve quality and productivity. This year, we'll add 5 additional sites.Second, we also expanded the use of AI to improve quality, efficiency and workforce experience in several clinical areas. AI can quickly identify patterns that signify possible disease and digital images of patient cultures and slides. In 2023, we expanded the use of AI in microbiology to help identify bacteria as well as in cytogenetics to identify chromosomal abnormalities. Looking forward, we are encouraged by the opportunities to use AI in several additional clinical areas including cytology, pathology and parasitology.Third, in 2023, we deployed an AI tool at our Clifton lab that helps laboratory staff continuously identify ways to be more productive in their daily routines. And we look forward to introducing this AI job helper in other labs and support processes. Finally, we made significant progress improving the margins of our base business in 2023. I'd like to personally thank our Quest colleagues whose efforts have helped make this possible.With that, I'll turn it over to Sam to provide more details on our performance and our 2024 guidance. Sam?"", 'Sam A. Samad', ""Thank, Jim. In the fourth quarter, consolidated revenue were $2.29 billion, down 1.9% versus the prior year. Base business revenues grew 4.7% to $2.25 billion, while COVID-19 testing revenues declined approximately 80% to $37 million. Revenues for Diagnostic Information Services declined 2% compared to the prior year, reflecting lower revenue from COVID-19 testing services versus the fourth quarter of 2022, partially offset by strong growth in our base testing revenue. Total volume, measured by the number of requisitions, increased 1.9% versus the fourth quarter of 2022, with acquisitions contributing 50 basis points to total volume. Total base testing volumes grew 5.2% versus the prior year. Revenue per requisition declined 3.5% versus the prior year driven primarily by lower COVID-19 molecular volume. Base business revenue per req was up 0.2%. Unit price reimbursement was positive and consistent with our expectations. Reported operating income in the fourth quarter was $267 million or 11.7% of revenues compared to $135 million or 5.8% of revenues last year. On an adjusted basis, operating income was $338 million or 14.8% of revenues compared to $330 million or 14.2% of revenues last year. The year-over-year increase in adjusted operating income is related primarily to growth in the base business, actions taken in 2023 to reduce support costs and lower performance-based compensation, partially offset by lower COVID-19 testing revenues, wage increases, higher employee health care costs and higher deferred compensation expense. Reported EPS was $1.70 in the quarter compared to $0.87 a year ago. Adjusted EPS was $2.15 compared to $1.98 last year. Cash from operations was $1.27 billion for full year 2023 versus $1.72 billion in the prior year, driven primarily by lower COVID-19 testing revenue. Finally, our Board of Directors has authorized a 5.6% increase in our quarterly dividend from $0.71 to $0.75 per share or $3 per share annually effective with the dividend payable in April 2024. The company has raised its dividend annually since 2011. Turning to our full year 2024 guidance. Revenues are expected to be between $9.35 billion and $9.45 billion. Reported EPS expected to be in a range of $7.69 to $7.99 and adjusted EPS to be in a range of $8.60 to $8.90. Cash from operations is expected to be approximately $1.3 billion and capital expenditures are expected to be approximately $420 million. We have posted a presentation on the Investor Relations page of our website that includes an adjusted earnings bridge which shows some of the key elements to bridge from our 2023 adjusted EPS to the 2024 adjusted EPS guidance we shared today. Our 2024 guidance reflects the following consideration. We are no longer providing detailed base business and COVID revenue guidance. However, note that we are assuming that COVID revenues will decline at least $175 million in 2024, which will partially offset the growth we expect from the base business. Most of the COVID headwind in 2024 will occur during the first quarter as we generated $119 million of COVID revenue in Q1 last year. In terms of M&A, our guidance only contemplates acquisitions that have been announced or closed to date, including the outreach acquisitions from NewYork-Presbyterian and Steward Health Care, as well as Lenco, the independent lab Jay mentioned earlier. We will absorb the full year of dilution from our acquisition of Haystack Oncology with an incremental impact of approximately $0.20 to adjusted EPS in 2024. We made strong progress improving our base business operating margins in 2023 and expect margin expansion in 2024. We anticipate net interest expense to increase to approximately $190 million in 2024 as a result of higher borrowings following our debt issuance in November. We assume a roughly flat share count compared to the end of 2023. We are expecting adjusted EPS in Q1 to be roughly 21% of our full year earnings. This is slightly below the typical seasonality and reflects the significant amount of weather disruption we've experienced in January. At this point, we anticipate a weather headwind of $0.05 to $0.07 in Q1. And finally, as Jim mentioned earlier, we are well positioned to deliver our long-term financial outlook to drive mid-single-digit revenue growth and high single-digit earnings growth. With that, I'll now turn it back to Jim."", 'James E. Davis', ""Thanks, Sam. Finally, I'd like to take a moment to remember Dr. Paul A. Brown, who passed away in January of this year. In 1967, Dr. Brown founded MetPath the predecessor company of Quest Diagnostics, providing basic lab services from his apartment in New York City. Dr. Brown was a pioneer who invented the blueprint for our industry that today is recognized as essential to quality health care, and we are grateful for his vision and leadership.To summarize, we delivered strong base business revenue growth in 2023 and achieved our EPS commitments. Our guidance in 2024 reflects a return to total revenue growth while balancing the earnings tailwinds and headwinds we see for the year. Looking beyond 2024, we are well positioned to deliver our long-term financial outlook to drive mid-single-digit revenue growth and high single-digit earnings growth. And I'm grateful to our dedicated Quest colleagues who bring our purpose to life every single day, working together to create a healthier world, one life at a time.Now we'd be happy to take your questions. Operator?"", 'Operator', '(Operator Instructions) And our first question of the day will come from Patrick Donnelly of Citi.', 'Patrick Bernard Donnelly', ""Probably one for Sam, just on the margin outlook for '24. Can you just expand a little bit on expectations there, including maybe the cadence for the year? And then just on the margin front with PAMA. Obviously, the push out, it's not a function of you getting any windfall by any means, but just that potential headwind being alleviated. Were there investments that you guys were kind of holding off on until you got more clarity on the outcome there? And then as you plan the budget, you greenlit some more of those as PAMA got pushed out. Just wondering how you thought about that expense piece there and a bit more color on margins."", 'Sam A. Samad', ""Yes. Thank you, Patrick. So listen, we made a lot of great progress in 2023 in terms of expanding our margins and offsetting the COVID headwind that we saw in '23. In terms of '24 expectations, as we mentioned on the prepared remarks, we're looking to expand margins, to continue to expand margins in '24 with, again, the key drivers of that are going to be volume growth, the expectation of volume growth that we have in the plan, that's going to be the biggest impact in terms of driving margins. We're going to be looking at continuing the great work that we're doing on Invigorate and offsetting any cost headwinds. We're assuming the labor inflation to be in line with what we saw in 2023, so somewhere in that 3% to 4% growth range, not necessarily expecting it to get worse, but not necessarily expecting it to get better either.In terms of your question on PAMA, Patrick, you're absolutely right. It's not a positive, it's the absence of a negative. So essentially, the delay gives us certainty now for '24 that we're not going to see a decline. And had PAMA occurred or had PAMA come back in 2024, you're right in the sense that we would have had to potentially defer certain investments. We would have had to make some potentially difficult cuts to offset some of that impact. And the fact that we have a delay affords us the ability now to make certain investments and to avoid some of those difficult cuts that I referenced. But I think the key punchline for 2024 is that we continue to expand operating margins.Jim, you wanted to make a..."", 'James E. Davis', ""Yes. So Patrick, you heard me discuss in our prepared remarks. We're going to continue to invest in our Alzheimer's portfolio of tests. There's still one important blood-based biomarker that we will bring up later this year and that will complete our investments in our Alzheimer's testing from a blood-based standpoint. You heard me mention that PFAS testing. We're bringing that test up. We'll be launching that here in the first quarter. We have gotten significant consumer and physician demand to bring that test up. And then finally, we're upgrading some of our laboratory information systems in a couple of our esoteric labs. And so the lack of this PAMA cut gives us the ability to continue to make those investments."", 'Operator', 'The next question comes from Elizabeth Anderson with Evercore ISI.', 'Elizabeth Hammell Anderson', ""I have a sort of unrelated 2-part combo one. One, can you talk about sort of the progress you're making on Haystack? I know sort of you ended up sort of on the higher end of the dilution. Is that because you're sort of accelerating test pushout and have seen incremental progress on that side? And then secondarily, can you remind us on your thoughts about share repo for the year? I know that's not in your current base guidance assumptions, but just wanted to hear your updated thoughts on that for capital deployment."", 'James E. Davis', ""Okay. Let me address the -- our progress on Haystack, Sam will take the second question. So Haystack is proceeding as we expected. There's no incremental investment versus what we thought. We said last year, $0.15 to $0.20 for the half year. And then likewise, $0.15 to $0.20 incremental this year. We are bringing the assay up in our Lewisville, Texas Cancer Center of Excellence. It's proceeding as we expected. We announced -- you heard in my prepared remarks, discussions of three clinical trials. So we are doing testing right this moment. Obviously, we're not getting paid for that testing as we continue to validate the assay. But we expect to have it launched here in the first half of the year for commercial purposes."", 'Sam A. Samad', ""Yes. And I'll take the second question. Elizabeth, just to be clear, the Haystack dilution in 2023 was in line with our expectations. It was $0.15 to $0.20. That's what we had called and that's where it came in, in that range of $0.15 to $0.20. With regard to share repo, so we did $275 million of share repo in Q4. Our current expectations are to basically offset equity dilution -- sorry, I said in '24, it's '23 in Q4. And our expectations are to offset equity dilution in '24. And that would work out to something in the similar range that we did in Q4, so somewhere around $250 million to $275 million. That's the base assumption, which is to offset equity dilution."", 'Operator', 'Our next question will come from Pito Chickering of Deutsche Bank.', 'Philip Chickering', ""There are a lot of moving pieces in the 2024 bridge you provided. If we look at operating margins, excluding Haystack dilution, how are operating margins in 2024 versus 2023? And then 4Q margins missed the street by a decent amount. Can you help us bridge the 4Q margins to what you're guiding to for 2024?"", 'Sam A. Samad', ""Sure. Why don't I take that, Pito. So first of all, in terms of operating margin for 2024, what's implied in the guide at the midpoint is expansion of operating margins. We're not calling out specifically what the operating margin rate, but there's definitely growth in terms of the operating margin rate and operating margin dollars in '24 versus '23 where we came in. And that's what's implied in the guide that we gave. With regard to the moving parts around Q4 and then how you bridge that into 2024, listen, there were three things that really impacted us in Q4 from an operating margin rate perspective. We came in at 14.8%. It was still growth year-over-year, significant growth year-over-year despite a significant drop in COVID revenues. But in terms of versus expectations, yes, we missed in terms of operating margin for three key reasons. Number one was employee health care costs. So I would weigh these three reasons, by the way, equally, so 1/3, 1/3, 1/3. But basically, employee health care costs was 1/3 of that miss. They came in higher than expected in Q4, and we can talk a little bit about what we're doing in '24 with regard to that. Additional -- some additional investments that we made towards the end of the year and some higher costs that we made, not necessarily related to labor costs, but some investments that we made, targeted investments in Q4, namely IT. So that was 1/3 of the miss as well.And then 1/3 was deferred compensation expense, which came in higher. Now remember, that's not an EPS impact. That's an operating margin impact that gets offset on the nonoperating expense line. But that impacted our margins again to the tune of 1/3 of that miss versus our expectations. Now if you look towards '24, the employee health care costs, I mean, we've factored that into our guide. We've also taken steps to lower employee health care costs by -- I mean we had frozen, for the last 3 years, the employee contribution part of our employee health care cost plan. And we're having now to pass some of that on back to employees in 2024 because we had, as I said, frozen them over the last 3 years, even with the significant inflation that you've seen in terms of health care. So that's already assumed in 2024. As I mentioned to Patrick, what's assumed is also volume growth that's going to help us grow margins. The deferred compensation, that's just noise. We don't really budget for that. If there's a headwind or a tailwind in '24, that just gets offset on the nonoperating line and it shows up as neutral in EPS. And then as I said, we made some additional investments in Q4 to position the business for 2024, and that's factored into the guide in terms of any additional investments that we make in '24. So we feel confident about our growth in terms of operating margins next -- this year."", 'James E. Davis', ""Yes. Peter, let me just go back to Q4 just to talk about the progress we made year-over-year. So as Sam indicated, our revenue in Q4 versus '22 was down $45 million. And if you look at the mix of that revenue, COVID was down $145 million year-over-year. And remember, we were getting paid $100 a req at that point. Our base business offset $100 million of that, which is why we were down $45 million. Despite that, bad mix and the lower revenue, we still improved our operating margin by 60 basis points. So we made significant progress in the quarter and that progress will continue as we march into 2024."", 'Operator', 'The next question comes from Jack Meehan of Nephron Research.', 'Jack Meehan', ""Jim, I was hoping to hear from you, like what are you assuming in terms of core utilization in terms of the guide? You've had elevated rates the last couple of years coming out of the pandemic. Do you think that can sustain? Or are you seeing moderation in any areas?"", 'James E. Davis', ""Yes. So for the fourth quarter, Jack, we saw volume growth of 5.1%. For the total year, we had volume growth of 6.5%. Now I would tell you at the very beginning portion of this year, the first 2 to 3 weeks, with the weather that we saw across the U.S., volume growth was stunted a bit. But in the last week or so, we've seen volume recover to the normal rates and expectations that we have for the year. So you've heard several of the health plans have reported higher utilization in the fourth quarter. We, ourselves, because of our own health care costs, we know there was higher utilization of our own employees. So we expect it to continue at slightly above the normal market rates, albeit the first month of the year has been tempered a little bit by weather."", 'Operator', 'The next question will come from Brian Tanquilut of Jefferies.', 'Brian Gil Tanquilut', ""Maybe, Sam, as I think about all the comments from Jim on how it looks like the revenue outlook is good, right, you have all these tailwinds, potentially going forward with new tests and whatnot, help us bridge to getting back to that EPS or earnings growth in the long-term outlook that you've provided. Because obviously, '24 is an aberration or there some one-timers here, but how do you get comfortable in that long-term earnings growth, '25 going forward?"", 'Sam A. Samad', ""Yes. Thanks, Brian. So first of all, let me say definitively that we are absolutely still confident about our long-term growth guide that we gave, which is essentially to grow revenues in the mid-single digits, to grow EPS in the high single digits. So long-term growth is unchanged.As you yourself mentioned, there are some headwinds in 2024 that I think are transient or temporary that we see this year. So we've got a COVID revenue decline, which is approximately $175 million or roughly $0.50 year-over-year. You've got -- and we've called this before, but you've got Haystack dilution, which is now full year dilution versus a half year dilution that we saw in '23. And then you've got interest expense, which is to the tune of about $0.25 which is really as a result of the additional debt that we took on and the higher borrowing costs driven by the macro environment that we're in. But that's really to fund acquisitions and to fund growth in the business as well, in the base business. We've got a strong pipeline, and we feel really confident about the M&A landscape and the M&A opportunities ahead of us. And we upsized the issuance in November to basically partly pay for the acquisitions that we made in '23, Haystack and to some extent, NewYork-Presbyterian, but also to fund the future acquisitions, some of which are not included in this guide. So I would say the punchline is we're definitely still confident about the long-term growth of the business and the EPS guide that we gave."", 'Operator', 'The next question comes from Kevin Caliendo of UBS.', 'Andrea Regina Zayco Narvaez Alfonso', ""It's Andrea Alfonso in for Kevin. I, unfortunately, am in the enviable position of asking yet another question around margin expectations. But I guess my question is, when we think about just the expansion of margins you expect and thinking about the puts and takes into next year, I guess, I want to isolate like what gets better. I know that there's maybe some assumption in there around the M&A you've absorbed so far. Is that mildly accretive or just sort of in line or maybe below the margin? Some of your -- in one of your slides, I think there was some mention of GAAP charges around workforce reductions, et cetera. Is that sort of just lingering on from 2023? Or is that a new tranche? Just trying to get an understanding on those two items."", 'Sam A. Samad', ""Yes. So thank you for the question. With regard to margin expansion, I mean, as I mentioned earlier, a big factor is going to be driven by volume growth that we see in 2024. That's really the key factor. We're going to continue to invigorate the actions that we have talked about to the tune of 3% cost reduction across our entire cost base. And that's -- we actually met that target in '23, we slightly exceeded it. And in '24, it's going to be continuing with those initiatives.With regard to any workforce reductions, there aren't any workforce reductions planned right now. Usually, when we have -- when you look at that GAAP to non-GAAP, we just have a placeholder for potential workforce reductions there or potential restructuring charges. But there isn't anything that's related specifically to any headcount cuts. Now we do have the cost reductions in '24 that we continue to see. So in Q1, for instance, we have some benefit from some cost reductions that we didn't see in Q1 of last year, but then we'll continue to be very disciplined about our P&L as we go forward in '24. So yes, so that's really the key driver in terms of our margin growth."", 'Operator', 'The next question will come from Lisa Gill of JPMorgan. (Operator Instructions)', 'Lisa Christine Gill', ""You talked a lot about volume growth this morning, but I'm just curious on the price side. So if I go back to the last couple of quarters, you talked about stabilizing pricing with health plans. You talked earlier about health plan leakage and the opportunity there. So maybe can you put those 2 pieces together for us as we think about the growth for next year of how much is volume and how much of that is on the price side?"", 'James E. Davis', ""Yes. So let me just recap '23 and then we'll get into '24. So in 2023, price, pure price, price per test, provided us a slight lift year-over-year, okay? So our base rev per req that we've reported was up 1.2% and price was a positive contributor towards that. Now going into 2024, we expect, again, price to be flat to slightly up for the year. We concluded all of the significant health plan renegotiations in '23. Obviously, there's a new tranche that always comes about 1/3 -- 25% to 33% renew every year, but we feel confident that prices will remain flat to slightly up as we enter 2024."", 'Operator', 'The next question will come from Derik De Bruin of Bank of America.', 'Derik De Bruin', ""So changing track a little. Look, the LDT legislation looks like it's making more progress than it has. It's like, can you quantify what your exposure is to LDTs and sort of your thought process here? I mean you're -- introducing a bunch of new tests would qualify for that. So how do you think about incremental investments if that goes through? And would you discontinue tests there?And then as a follow-up, there's been some legal movement lately on the MRD space. There's been some litigation that's happened that has blocked some other players from the market. Does Haystack have freedom to operate as you sort of look at what's changed in the IP landscape on that? And how do you think about your IP portfolio on Haystack and being able to not get sued."", 'James E. Davis', ""Yes. So let me address your second question first. We have no risk with respect to the IP on the underlying technology that we're using in Haystack. We feel very confident about it. Much of that IP comes out of John Hopkins University, and we're solid there. So no risk.In terms of LDTs, I think we've said in the past, about 10% of our tests are considered LDTs. We'll wait to hear from the FDA in April what the final rule is, and then we'll make decisions as an industry from there. What I would tell you is that we do a significant amount of work for the pharmaceutical industry today, and we do a significant amount of work for international laboratories. Both of those require us to be ISO certified and when you're doing work for the pharmaceutical industry, especially for companion diagnostics, you're essentially operating already under FDA regulation. So it's not going to be anything radical that we don't know what we need to do. Will there be further investments and steps required to get all of our laboratories that do LDTs accredited? Yes, there will be. But it's not a heavy lift for Quest Diagnostics."", 'Operator', '(Operator Instructions) The next question will come from Andrew Brackmann of William Blair.', 'Andrew Frederick Brackmann', ""I want to go back to the Alzheimer's offerings and the investments that you're making there. Can you maybe just sort of talk at a high level about the opportunity that you see for that category. Should we sort of think about this market kind of ultimately looking something like oncology where you have screening, therapy selection, monitoring, et cetera? Or does it sort of take a different path for you guys?"", 'James E. Davis', ""Yes. So thanks for the question. It's a great question. So first, I would say that there's just broader awareness of testing the options that are now available to both consumers and to physicians. In part, this is because of new therapeutics that have been introduced that has just created widespread awareness. As you know, the majority of testing today for Alzheimer's is conducted via PET CT, which are expensive $2,500 to $4,000 exams or CSF testing, cerebral spinal fluid, which is not an expensive lab test, however, the procedure to extract CFS out of the human body is an expensive procedure. And likewise, the total cost of that is roughly $1,000. We have brought up blood-based assays or ApoE, which is a genetic risk for Alzheimer's. We brought up a blood-based assay for what we call AB 42/40, which is generally considered the earliest indicator amyloid plaque, the earliest indicator of dementia and/or Alzheimer's onset. And then we brought up one of the two protein markers that are also involved, the tau markers. We brought up 181 and there's a second one, 217, that we will be bringing up later this year. That, in essence, completes our blood-based offering. And I think there's widespread consumer interest, widespread interest amongst primary care physicians. And we've had double-digit growth all year long in both our blood-based assays and CSF testing, and we expect that double-digit growth to continue on in 2024 and beyond."", 'Operator', 'The next question will come from Stephanie Davis of Barclays.', 'Stephanie July Davis', ""So I was hoping to dig in a little bit more on to the AI question you're having and discussions around the prepared remarks. Could you tell me just a little bit more about what you'll be investing into and how maybe the rollout of things of the AI job helper will help you guys out? And then I guess on a follow-up to that one, is it safe to assume that you'll have more IT investments as you develop some of these AI solutions that will then have more out year yield for your margin opportunity?"", 'James E. Davis', ""Yes. So good question. The AI tool that we referred to with respect to our Clifton lab, is really -- it was a tool that we used to analyze workflow within several departments in the Clifton laboratory that actually looked at from fairly simple things like steps and movement between equipment, loading and unloading of certain racks, and we reviewed it and you find some really quick easy simplification efforts to adjust equipment, move equipment, to minimize the human content or labor involved in each one of these steps. More broadly, we've deployed AI in two critical areas. One is in microbiology. Microbiology, as you know, you grow things in a dish, you look at it under a microscope. But with one of our partners, we now -- we can take digital images of what's growing in the dish and the system actually reviews those images and makes the initial call of a negative or a positive. We still review the positives by eye, but it's a digital image as opposed to doing it under a microscope. But it's a much quicker read because the system has generally indicated -- the system has already indicated if it is positive. We're also in the process of deploying artificial intelligence and digitizing pathology. So as you know, pathology is generally read under a microscope. We're in the process of implementing digital systems that allow for one to read off of a monitor versus under a microscope. And once you've digitized that slide, you're now able to apply algorithms to, again, at least help with what we call region of interest, pointing out to the pathologist where they should look and inevitably helping the pathologists make the proper diagnosis."", 'Operator', ""And the last question for today's call will come from Eric Coldwell of Baird."", 'Eric White Coldwell', 'I have actually going to have a couple here. First, the -- I missed this, what was the M&A contribution to revenue growth in 2024 guidance?', 'Sam A. Samad', ""So it's about 50 basis points right now is what's in the guide, Eric. And it really reflects, as we mentioned in the prepared remarks, the carryover that we have from the acquisitions that we did in '23, which is really NewYork-Presbyterian, the Steward Health Care, the Lenco acquisition that we signed. And really, that's it."", 'Eric White Coldwell', ""So if I take midpoint revenue guidance at $1.6 million, remove the COVID headwind, you get to about 3.5% on the base and then take out 50 bps from M&A, you're at 3% organic on the base."", 'Sam A. Samad', ""That's -- yes. That's correct."", 'Eric White Coldwell', 'Okay. Second question, a higher mix of hospital reference testing, it sounds like. You talked about trends in hospital reference being above, plan being above long-term history. What kind of an impact does that have on gross margin in the quarter?', 'James E. Davis', ""Yes. So in general, our reference testing, which is more LDT-like than it is the routine testing, as you know, Eric. In general, that carries a higher test margin, higher gross margin. And in general, right, we're not drawing specimens that are derived or taken in hospitals. So there's very little phlebotomy cost involved in reference work. So generally, the operating margin of our hospital-based tests are going to be higher than the average of the business. So that business did grow at a faster rate than our overall book of business, both in Q4 as well as for the total year. So it was good mix."", 'Operator', 'And that was our final question for today.', 'James E. Davis', 'All right.
