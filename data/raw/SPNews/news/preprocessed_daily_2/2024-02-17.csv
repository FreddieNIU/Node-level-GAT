Just as last year's rising interest rates made lending a more profitable business, the interest rate cuts expected later this year could re-crimp lending's profitability. Loan delinquencies are on the rise as well. Both work against companies in the money business, as does the occasional lingering hint of economic lethargy. The relatively poor performance of most financial stocks since early last year suggests investors see this sector's unique risks."", ""In a few too many cases, though, the sellers have overshot their target. That is to say that several financial stocks have become oddly cheap within the past few months, pricing in far more worry than is merited. If you can stomach the volatility they're sure to continue dishing out for the foreseeable future, three of these names may be worth taking a shot on here."", ""Ally Financial (NYSE: ALLY) is an online-only bank. Don't let its lack of a brick-and-mortar presence fool you, though. The company offers all the services you'd expect from any traditional bank, including checking and savings accounts, credit cards, investing, and a wide array of loans. The bulk of its bottom line, however, is lending, and car loans in particular. Not counting corporate-level write-downs, more than 80% of last year's pre-tax income came from the automobile industry, with more than two-thirds of it being driven by auto financing alone."", ""That was an incredibly fortunate business mix in 2021 and then again in 2023, when demand for new cars was huge. As noted, however, cracks are starting to show. At the same time, demand for new vehicles is waning, and past borrowers are now falling behind on their payments. The U.S. Federal Reserve reports that as of the fourth quarter of last year, 2.66% of the United States' automobile loans are now 90 days or more behind. That's not only up from 2.22% a year earlier, but it's pushing past pre-pandemic levels when the economy was at least in decent shape."", ""And Ally is showing signs of this struggle. Last year's loan-loss provision of nearly $2 billion is well up from the prior year's figure of $1.4 billion. Its delinquencies are rising, too, pushing its charge-off rate from 1.16% of its total loan portfolio in the final quarter of 2022 up to 1.77% in the final quarter of last year."", ""The thing is, on balance, these metrics actually aren't all that bad."", 'They\'re not likely to get much worse either, in light of last quarter\'s surprisingly strong GDP growth of 4.9% and last month\'s similarly strong U.S. job growth of 353,000 new positions. These numbers suggest the economy is easing into a so-called ""soft landing"" before starting a more sustained expansion instead of making a hard landing that just plain hurts. That\'s good for Ally Financial, but it\'s even better for Ally shares that are priced at only 11 times this year\'s consensus per-share profit estimate.', ""It's another bank, but U.S. Bancorp (NYSE: USB) is considerably different from Ally. While U.S. Bank does offer a variety of online and app-based banking services, its roots are brick-and-mortar branches. It operates over 2,000 of them in 26 states, employing more than 75,000 people. All told, it boasts more than $600 billion in assets. That's big ... except it's not nearly as big as the likes of JPMorgan Chase or Bank of America, both of which are tending to more than $2 trillion worth of assets."", ""This smaller size could be seen as a liability, and in some ways, it is. It may prevent U.S. Bancorp from venturing into lucrative markets. The capital markets business comes to mind. While the company does provide basic investment and wealth-management services, it's not really a player when it comes to underwriting stocks or managing a commission-generating trading business."", ""In other ways, though, this regional bank's smaller size leaves it nimbler than its bigger banking rivals, allowing it to do things lots of other banks don't. Take its payment services arm as an example. Credit cards, corporate payments, and merchant processing accounted for roughly 40% of last year's non-interest income. These businesses' bottom lines are considerably more predictable and consistent than those tethered to interest rates are."", ""Perhaps the chief reason to step into U.S. Bancorp shares now that they're trading at a mere 10 times this year's expected earnings, however, is a less evident one. This bank just has a history of smart, conservative self-management. The dividend yield of just under 5% isn't too shabby, either."", 'Last, but not least, consider jumping into a stake in Ares Capital (NASDAQ: ARCC) while its dividend yield stands at a frothy 9.5% and shares are priced at less than 9 times their trailing and forward-looking profits.', 'Those juicy numbers come with an important footnote, of course.', ""Ares Capital shares may be a conventional stock, but this isn't a conventional company. It's categorized as a business development company (BDC), which, as the name suggests, helps businesses grow. It provides capital to smaller enterprises that may not want or be able to secure a bank loan, but that also don't want to issue stock to raise funds. This funding can be supplied in exchange for equity in the company in question, but it's usually in the form of a loan. The interest rates on these loans are typically higher than market-based rates, reflecting their above-average risk. It's worth these terms to both the borrower and the lender, though. It's also worth the risk to BDC shareholders, as these stocks tend to generate above-average dividend payments."", ""Investors keeping close tabs on Ares Capital may already know the past four years have proved complicated for the company. First, the COVID-19 pandemic disrupted most of its borrowers' businesses, and then the recent shake-up of interest rates has set the BDC business on its ear. These organizations generally rely on short-term funding that costs less than the long-term interest rates they're charging. With the yield curve outright turning upside down in the middle of 2022, however, a key aspect of Ares Capital's business model has been rattled. Revenue and earnings have been just as shaken up."", 'There\'s a light at the end of the tunnel, though. That is, interest rates are slowly but surely easing their way back to normal, and the economy is seemingly healing without suffering the aforementioned ""hard landing"" that an inverted yield curve usually indicates is in the cards.', ""It's not the kind of pick that's right for everyone, and even if it is right for you, it probably shouldn't be the centerpiece of your holdings. Between the stock's low price, its big dividend, and a slow-churning economic recovery on the horizon, however, Ares Capital could certainly be worth considering as an addition to your portfolio."", 'Should you invest $1,000 in U.S. Bancorp right now?', 'Before you buy stock in U.S. Bancorp, consider this:', 'The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\xa010 best stocks for investors to buy now… and U.S. Bancorp wasn’t one of them.

I would now like to turn the presentation over to the host for today, Mr. Martin Jarosick, with CF Investor Relations. Sir, please proceed.', ""Martin Jarosick: Good morning and thanks for joining the CF Industries earnings conference call. With me today are Tony Will, CEO; Chris Bohn, Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer, and Bert Frost, Executive Vice President of Sales, Market Development and Supply Chain. CF Industries reported its results for the full-year and fourth quarter of 2023 yesterday afternoon. On this call, we'll review the results, discuss our outlook, and then host a question-and-answer session. Statements made on this call and in the presentation on our website that are not historical facts are forward looking statements. These statements are not guarantees of future performance and involve risks, uncertainties and assumptions that are difficult to predict."", ""Therefore, actual outcomes and results may differ materially from what is expressed or implied in any statements. More detailed information about factors that may affect our performance may be found in our filings with the SEC, which are available on our website. Also, you'll find reconciliations between GAAP and non GAAP measures in the press release and the presentation posted on our website. Now let me introduce Tony Will, our President and CEO."", ""Tony Will: Thanks Martin, and good morning everyone. Yesterday afternoon we posted financial results for the full-year 2023 in which we generated adjusted EBITDA of approximately $2.8 billion. Net cash from operations was also $2.8 billion and free cash flow was $1.8 billion. These results reflect a healthy nitrogen supply demand balance and global energy spreads that favor our low cost production base in North America. They also represent outstanding execution by the CF Industries team. We worked safely, ran our plants well, and navigated dynamic industry conditions. Our investments in people, safety and reliability have built the industry's highest performing manufacturing network, as you can see on Slide 6. Looking ahead, over the next four years, confirmed construction of new nitrogen production capacity is not sufficient to keep pace with the historical nitrogen demand growth rate of roughly 1.5% per year in traditional applications."", 'Adding to this tight supply demand situation is the risk that existing ammonia production capacity in several important regions remains on the verge of permanent closure due to constrained availability and cost of natural gas. Meanwhile, emerging demand for low carbon ammonia into clean energy applications should further tighten the already strained global supply demand balance. As a result, we are confident that our cash generation will remain strong, as underscored by the recent increase in our quarterly dividend and continued share repurchases. We look to continue to invest in high return organic and inorganic projects to grow our cash generation. As such, we continue evaluating a new low carbon ammonia production plant at our Blue Point Complex in Louisiana with our partner, Mitsui.', 'Our company share a belief that North America is the best location for production of low carbon ammonia, given natural gas cost advantages and access to CCS sites and expertise. As you can see on Slide 8, the economic value of North American nitrogen assets continues to increase over time, supporting returns greater than the cost of capital and new projects. We and Mitsui are targeting a final investment decision in the second half of 2024, when we have additional information on low carbon ammonia production technologies and better clarity on customer requirements for carbon intensity levels, along with regulatory developments. While taking a disciplined approach to growth, we will continue to return capital through our dividends and share repurchases.', 'We have approximately $2.6 billion remaining on our current share repurchase authorization and fully expect to complete it before its expiration at the end of 2025. With that, let me turn it over to Bert, who will discuss the global nitrogen market conditions in more detail. Bert?', 'Bert Frost: Thanks Tony. The fourth quarter of 2023 was an active period for our team, highlighted by the largest fall ammonia application season in North America in years. A strong fall application season indicates a commitment to nitrogen consuming crops on these acres and robust demand for additional urea and UAN applications through the first half of 2024. This, along with strong ag fundamentals, supports our outlook for a positive spring application season. We expect 91 million acres of corn to be planted in the United States. As we continue to work with customers in advance of spring applications, we believe supply is more constrained in the North American nitrogen channel than industry expectations. Inventories were below average entering the year and net imports of nitrogen to the region are not making up the difference.', ""The cold snap we experienced in North America during January has exacerbated this situation. We believe that there has been significant volume of domestic nitrogen production lost due to weather related shutdowns across the region's supply base. We estimate that CF Industries lost approximately 150,000 tons of ammonia production in January from our own network due to the weather, unexpected supply tightness often leads to follow on logistics challenges and early spring would further strain the supply chain. We believe that our in region production and extensive logistics and distribution capabilities will serve us well in this environment. Global grain stocks use ratios have returned to normal levels after two robust growing seasons. However, we do not project a significant impact on global nitrogen demand, given the imperative to seed growing populations."", ""We expect continued supply constraints in key producing regions, most notably ammonia production economics in Europe remain challenging. Global ammonia spot prices continues to align with the full cost of European ammonia production, confirming Europe as the industry's marginal producer. This continues to support elevated imports of nitrogen products into Europe compared to a decade ago. Beyond Europe, natural gas availability continues to affect ammonia and UAN production in Trinidad. And based on its actions in the fourth quarter of 2023, we believe the Chinese government will limit exports through the first half to ensure supply availability and urea price stability for the Chinese domestic market. Looking ahead, forward energy curves suggest continued favorable energy spreads between low cost North American production and high cost production in Europe and Asia."", 'We believe this will support sustained margin opportunities for our low cost manufacturing asset base. With that, let me turn the call over to Chris.', ""Chris Bohn: Thanks Bert. For the full year 2023, the company reported net earnings attributable to common stockholders of approximately $1.5 billion, or $7.80 per diluted share. EBITDA was $2.7 billion and adjusted EBITDA was approximately $2.8 billion. In the fourth quarter, we completed the acquisition of Incitec Pivot's Waggaman ammonia production facility. After adjustments and accounting for the value assigned to a long term supply agreement with IPL's Dyno Nobel subsidiary, our cash purchase price was approximately $1.2 billion. The Waggaman facility has operated as expected since closing and has generated margin commensurate with our existing ammonia segment. Looking ahead to 2024, we expect capital expenditures for the year to be in the range of $550 million and for gross ammonia production to be near 10 million tons."", 'As Bert said, we experienced unplanned weather related outages in our network during January. During these outages, we pulled forward some planned maintenance activities. This should reduce scheduled downtime later this year, mitigating some of the production loss in January. As a result, we expect gross ammonia production for the year to be near our projection. Commissioning of our green ammonia project at Donaldsonville is underway. We are currently evaluating the purchase of renewable energy credits to pair with the start-up of the electrolyzer to enable green ammonia production and maximize the value of the 45B production tax credit. We expect that the CO2 dehydration and compression unit at Donaldsonville will be ready for start-up in 2025.', 'This will enable low carbon ammonia production and generate substantial 45Q tax credits. We are also making progress on other CCS opportunities with returns above our cost of capital. Turning to the potential new low-carbon ammonia plant at our Blue Point complex in Louisiana, we completed our FEED study on a conventional steam methane reformer ammonia plant with CCS technologies. The FEED study estimates the cost of the ammonia plant at approximately $2.5 billion, we estimate another $500 million for scalable infrastructure, such as storage tanks and loading docks. Our FEED studies focused on autothermal reforming or ATR ammonia production technology and flue gas capture are progressing well. Alongside disciplined clean energy investments, we are committed to returning capital to long-term shareholders.', 'In 2023, we returned almost $900 million to shareholders through share repurchases and dividend payments despite being locked out of the repurchases for part of the year. We expect share repurchase activity to increase over the two remaining years on our current authorization. As you can see on Slide 7 and 8, on both a free cash flow yield and a precedent transaction basis, our enterprise value is significantly undervalued, supporting continued share repurchases. With that, Tony will provide some closing remarks before we open the call to Q&A.', 'Tony Will: Thanks, Chris. Before we move on to your questions, I want to thank everyone at CF Industries for their contributions to an outstanding year. I especially want to highlight the progress our team made in the second half of the year regarding our safety performance. After a challenging start to 2023, we ended the year with a 12-month recordable incident rate of 0.36 incidents per 200,000 work hours, in line with our performance in recent years and significantly better than industry averages. Our operational excellence and significant structural advantages underpin our cash generation. This enables us to invest in the business to further increase cash generation and drive increased shareholder participation in our free cash flow.', ""In the last three years, we acquired the Waggaman ammonia production facility, advanced high return clean energy initiatives, increased our dividend by 67% and deployed $2.5 billion to repurchase more than 31 million shares which represented approximately 15% of the outstanding share count at that time. Additionally, we have strengthened our balance sheet to provide us tremendous flexibility as we are able to grow our business at the same time as return significant cash to shareholders. This approach has had a dramatic impact. As you can see on Slide 10, shareholder participation in our business has increased 80% in the last 10 years. We're excited about the opportunity ahead of us to build on this track record. In the near term, we expect industry fundamentals to remain favorable to our low-cost production network."", 'Longer term, disciplined investments in low-carbon ammonia production can provide a robust growth platform for the company. Taken together, we expect to continue creating substantial value for long-term shareholders. With that, operator, we will now open the call to your questions.', 'See also Top 16 Aircraft Manufacturers In The World and Top 20 Most Valuable Blockchain Companies in 2024.', 'To continue reading the Q&A session, please click here.']"

The value is really nothing new that we're inventing in-store marketing has been done forever, right?"", 'All we did is we saw the need that, bringing that analog marketing into the new age of digital will give the marketers the ability to understand the performance of their advertising buys. It will help them to understand those micro segments and those opportunities to connect what I say intent with the content and drive the performance that is incremental to their businesses.', ""- And Arsen, what happens, though-- you're shopping, right? What happens if the item you see on the display isn't in the actual freezer?"", ""ARSEN AVAKIAN: Well, so for the form factor, you're referring to on the coolers and freezers.

But Target’s new “dealworthy” brand, which includes items from jumbo cotton balls to boxer briefs, could call that strategy into question.', 'The retailer introduced the budget-conscious brand on Thursday with nearly 400 products, mostly essentials and apparel, priced mostly under $10, which Target says is among the lowest shoppers will find in stores. Put off by rising costs due to inflation, customers have embraced store-brand “dupes” to save cash. Over half of shoppers surveyed by the Food Industry Association in October said they planned to buy private-label grocery brands, such as Target’s Good & Gather or Costco’s Kirkland Signature.', '""We know that value is top of mind for consumers, and dealworthy, backed by our owned brand promise, will not only appeal to our current guests but position us to attract even more new shoppers to Target,” said Rick Gomez, Target’s executive vice president and chief food, essentials, and beauty officer, in a press release.', 'The pressure is on for Target to keep pace with other low-cost competitors. While Walmart has seen steady share price increases over the past five years, Target’s stock has ebbed and flowed.', ""Target relies heavily on its own-brand products, which have become increasingly important as inflation-induced cost hikes have scared customers away from spending. In 2022, $30 billion of Target's sales came from own-brand products, a huge chunk of its $109 billion in revenue. Despite beating third-quarter profit expectations, Target fell short in sales and saw a 4.9% decline ahead of the holiday season. The retailer also suffered sales losses due to conservative boycotts of its Pride merch last August."", 'Walmart cashed in last year on customers trying to stretch their budgets, reporting strong third-quarter gains in November, but is still cautious of spending cutbacks. Target could also be eyeing dollar-store customers, particularly after Dollar Tree raised prices above $1.', 'But Marshall Fisher, professor of operations, information, and decisions at Wharton, warned that Target’s new budget brand could appear more like a cry for help than a deliberate act to help customers.', ""“Producing a bundle of 400 low-cost products could be viewed as a Hail Mary, like they're desperate,” Fisher told Fortune."", 'For years, Target’s strategic position has been cheap-chic, relying on higher-quality products at slightly higher prices to draw in customers. The retailer committed to the philosophy decades ago amidst slowing sales, and stuck to that ethos for years to successfully launch exclusive brands.', 'Fisher is dubious that emulating Walmart’s rock-bottom pricing will be effective. It’s just hard to beat Walmart’s prices.', '“Pick a few items at Target versus Walmart. What would a basket cost at Walmart versus Target?” Fisher said. “I bet you Walmart is going to come out cheaper.”', 'But beyond cheap prices, Walmart tapped into the online grocery market, a service appealing to wealthier shoppers looking for convenience, more effectively than Target. Walmart captured over one-third of online grocery sales in 2023’s second quarter, and its e-commerce business grew 24% from 2022. The retailer crushed Amazon in online grocery sales last year and is expected to continue to do so.', 'Target has been slow to react. The company has been toying with launching a paid membership comparable to Amazon Prime or Walmart+, but has not announced any official plans for the initiative, Bloomberg reported earlier this month.', 'The yet-to-be-launched service, referred to internally as Project Trident, would reportedly use the grocery delivery business Shipt, which Target bought in 2017. Target has a free loyalty service called Target Circle, which offers rewards and promotions to members, but the paid membership would offer services beyond this.', 'Right now, Target is trying to be “everything to everyone,” Fisher warns, as the company weighs its options for luring back customers from competitors.', ""“Target has to decide who they're competing with,” he said."", 'This story was originally featured on Fortune.com']"

The stock has made an impressive rebound since then and is currently trading at its 52-week high, outperforming the market since the start of January 2024 (+8.9% vs. +5.3%).', 'It will be interesting to see if this performance momentum can be sustained following fresh quarterly results on Tuesday, February 20th.

As we know, Amazon’s Q4 earnings were up +410.9% on +13.9% higher revenues, beating top and bottom-line expectations.', 'As we all know, the digital and brick-and-mortar operators have been converging for some time now. Amazon is now a decent-sized brick-and-mortar operator after Whole Foods, and Walmart is a growing online vendor.

One can intuitively project moderation in consumer spending as the economy further slows down under the weight of tighter monetary conditions. Inflation may be down from the multi-decade highs of a few quarters back, but it still remains a headwind, particularly for the lower end of income distribution. Other issues, like the resumption of student loan payments, are seen as weighing on spending trends. That said, the labor market remains very strong, with wages still going up.', 'We will hear more about issues on the Q4 earnings calls, likely in the context of their outlooks for the coming periods.', 'Standout Features of the Q4 Earnings Season', 'The overall picture that emerged from the Q4 earnings season is one of stability and resilience as a whole, with key pockets starting to enjoy notable acceleration in the growth momentum.', 'Earnings aren’t great, but no one expected corporate profitability to be strong. The earnings naysayers have been relatively less vocal in their doom-and-gloom pronouncements lately. But the fear of an impending earnings cliff has been in the back of market participants’ minds. These results have likely eased many of those fears.', 'With quarterly results from more than 79% of S&P 500 members already out through Friday, February 16th, here are the five key features that these quarterly results have confirmed.', 'First, the Q4 earnings and revenue growth pace represents an acceleration from what we have seen in recent quarters.', 'The absolute level of Q4 earnings and revenue growth isn’t much, and the improving trend may not seem like a big deal to some of you. But we nevertheless see this improving growth trend as significant and a sign of the things to come in the coming periods.', 'For the 396 S&P 500 members that have reported results through Friday, February 16th, total earnings and revenues are up +5.1% and +3.4% from the same period last year, respectively.

The sector is currently expected to bring in 28.6% of the index’s total earnings over the coming four-quarter period, with the second and third biggest contributors in Finance and Medical at 17.8% and 12.5%, respectively.', 'This means that the Tech sector’s growth profile has a very big impact on the aggregate picture, both negatively and positively.

Higher rents pushed U.S. consumer prices up more than expected in January, spooking markets and raising the possibility that interest rates will stay high for months longer than what investors expected.', 'Walmart is expected to post a roughly $11 billion rise in sales for the quarter spanning Nov. 1 to Jan. 31, or up 4%, according to LSEG estimates.', 'Walmart, the first major U.S. retailer to report results, had a robust holiday selling period, analysts at Cowen said.', ""Shopper visits to Walmart's 5,000 U.S. stores rose 4.5% during the quarter, Cowen said, citing an internal survey. Shoppers also spent more, with credit-card spending rising nearly 4% from November to mid-January, Cowen said."", 'In contrast, at rival Target, which reports results next month, traffic rose just 0.3% with credit-card spending falling 9%, the brokerage said.', 'Analysts also expect Walmart to show stronger profitability thanks to lower supply chain costs and the falling price of gas since November, analysts said. Net income is expected to rise 8%.', 'For most of last year, consumer spending remained healthy buffeted by a strong job market. Consumers defied inflation to ring in a solid holiday shopping season.', 'With grocery prices still well above pre-pandemic levels, more shoppers are gravitating to Walmart because of its food costs, leading to market-share gains over grocery rivals, analysts at Bank of America said.', 'Walmart finds itself in a sweet spot in this inflationary environment as it gets about 70% of its sales from grocery, health and essential products, which consumers are focused on. The improved traffic this brings, in turn, improves its ability to sell non-food items such as apparel and furniture, even in a dis-inflationary environment, analysts said.', 'Due to its heft in grocery, Walmart is expected to report sales of $645 billion for fiscal 2024, more than double its closest competitor.', 'Still, concerns linger about how fast inflation will cool this year. Several major Walmart suppliers are striking cautious tones.', 'Kraft Heinz, Mondelez, Hershey and PepsiCo flagged softer volume growth in their latest quarterly results as shoppers digested price hikes.', 'Ahold Delhaize, the operator of Stop and Shop and Food Lion stores in the U.S., reported a decline in sales in the region in part due to the stoppage of pandemic-related hunger relief benefits last year.', 'Two investors said they expect Walmart executives to shed fresh light on American shoppers\' behavior following inflation data. ""Are they more resilient to price hikes than we think?,"" said David Klink, senior analyst at Huntington Private Bank which owns more than $50 million in Walmart stock.', 'Charles Sizemore, chief investment at Sizemore Capital Management, will watch the degree to which shoppers are shifting what and where they buy in order to save money. ""If (Walmart) they come in and say they are seeing inflation is sticky and are finding it difficult to pass those on to customers, that would be bad for Walmart and the industry in general,"" he said. Sizemore Capital owns about $2 million of Walmart shares.', 'Arun Sundaram, an analyst at CFRA Research, expects Walmart to issue conservative guidance, forecasting sales growth of 3% for its fiscal year ending Jan 31, 2025.

GuruFocus has detected 3 Warning Sign with HBAN.', 'On February 16, 2024, Huntington Bancshares Inc (NASDAQ:HBAN) filed its 10-K report, providing a comprehensive overview of its financial performance and strategic positioning. As a regional bank holding company with a rich history dating back to 1866, Huntington has established a significant presence in the Midwestern United States. The company\'s financial tables reveal a solid foundation, with an Allowance for Credit Losses (ACL) of $2.4 billion as of December 31, 2023, indicating a proactive approach to managing credit risk. Huntington\'s strategic realignment into two primary business segmentsConsumer & Regional Banking and Commercial Bankingreflects its commitment to delivering a complete set of banking products and services with exceptional service. The bank\'s emphasis on digital innovation and customer-centric products, such as its ""Fair Play"" banking philosophy, positions it well in a competitive landscape. However, the bank must navigate potential credit risks, economic uncertainties, and fierce competition to maintain and enhance its market position.', 'Brand Power and Customer-Centric Products: Huntington Bancshares Inc (NASDAQ:HBAN) has cultivated a strong brand identity through its ""Fair Play"" banking philosophy, which includes customer-friendly products like 24-Hour Grace and Asterisk-Free Checking. This approach has resonated with consumers and businesses, aiding customer acquisition and retention. The bank\'s suite of products, such as Standby Cash and Huntington Heads Up, demonstrates a focus on innovation and customer advocacy, which are crucial in differentiating Huntington in a crowded market. Additionally, the bank\'s position as the #1 SBA lender in the nation by loan volume as of federal fiscal year-end September 30, 2023, underscores its strength in small business lending and commitment to supporting the growth of its clients.', ""Digital Innovation and Market Presence: Huntington's investment in digitally powered consumer and business financial solutions has positioned it as a leader in digital banking innovation. The bank's comprehensive online and mobile banking platforms cater to the evolving needs of customers, enhancing convenience and accessibility. Furthermore, Huntington's extensive branch and ATM network across key Midwestern states provide a solid physical presence that complements its digital offerings. This dual approach ensures a broad reach and caters to diverse customer preferences, reinforcing the bank's market presence and competitive advantage."", ""Credit Risk Management: Despite a robust ACL of $2.4 billion, Huntington Bancshares Inc (NASDAQ:HBAN) acknowledges that its credit loss level may not always be adequate to cover future losses. The bank's financial health is closely tied to the creditworthiness of its customers, and any unanticipated adverse changes in the economy or specific industries could materially affect its net income and capital. This potential vulnerability highlights the need for Huntington to continuously refine its credit risk management strategies to safeguard against fluctuating economic conditions and market dynamics."", ""Dependence on Economic Conditions: Huntington's performance is susceptible to economic uncertainties, including inflation, rising interest rates, and supply chain issues. These factors could lead to decreased demand for loans and other services, increased customer delinquencies, and a higher level of non-performing assets (NPAs). As the markets Huntington serves are heavily reliant on industrial and manufacturing businesses, the bank must remain vigilant and adaptable to mitigate the impact of economic downturns on its operations and financial stability."", 'Expansion of Digital Capabilities: The ongoing digital transformation in the banking industry presents significant opportunities for Huntington Bancshares Inc (NASDAQ:HBAN) to further enhance its digital capabilities. By continuing to develop innovative solutions, such as Huntington ChoicePay, the bank can attract tech-savvy customers and meet the growing demand for seamless digital banking experiences. Additionally, leveraging data analytics and artificial intelligence can lead to more personalized services, fostering deeper customer relationships and driving revenue growth.', ""Market Expansion and Diversification: Huntington has the potential to expand its footprint beyond its core Midwestern states, tapping into new markets and customer segments. Strategic partnerships or acquisitions could accelerate this expansion, providing access to new revenue streams and diversifying the bank's portfolio. Moreover, Huntington's expertise in specific industry verticals, such as healthcare and technology, allows for targeted growth initiatives that can capitalize on industry-specific trends and demands."", 'Intense Competition: Huntington Bancshares Inc (NASDAQ:HBAN) operates in a highly competitive financial services landscape, contending with traditional banks, credit unions, and non-bank lenders. The rise of Financial Technology Companies (FinTechs) poses an additional threat, as they offer innovative and often more cost-effective alternatives to traditional banking services. To maintain its competitive edge, Huntington must continue to invest in customer service, product development, and technology to meet the evolving expectations of its customers.', ""Regulatory and Legislative Changes: The financial industry is subject to stringent regulatory oversight, and any changes in legislation or regulations could impact Huntington's operations. For instance, the Economic Growth Act and the Tailoring Rules could alter the competitive dynamics by reducing the regulatory burden on certain large bank holding companies. Huntington must stay abreast of regulatory developments and adapt its strategies accordingly to ensure compliance and competitive viability."", 'In conclusion, Huntington Bancshares Inc (NASDAQ:HBAN) exhibits a strong foundation with its customer-centric approach, digital innovation, and market presence. However, it must navigate credit risks, economic sensitivities, and intense competition to sustain growth. Opportunities for digital expansion and market diversification present promising avenues for Huntington to explore, while the bank must remain vigilant against the threats posed by a dynamic regulatory environment and the rise', 'This article, generated by GuruFocus, is designed to provide general insights and is not tailored financial advice.

The ex-dividend date is one business day before the record date, which is the cut-off date for shareholders to be present on the company's books to be eligible for a dividend payment. The ex-dividend date is an important date to be aware of as any purchase of the stock made on or after this date might mean a late settlement that doesn't show on the record date. Accordingly, Microchip Technology investors that purchase the stock on or after the 22nd of February will not receive the dividend, which will be paid on the 8th of March."", ""The company's upcoming dividend is US$0.45 a share, following on from the last 12 months, when the company distributed a total of US$1.80 per share to shareholders. Calculating the last year's worth of payments shows that Microchip Technology has a trailing yield of 2.2% on the current share price of US$81.61. If you buy this business for its dividend, you should have an idea of whether Microchip Technology's dividend is reliable and sustainable. As a result, readers should always check whether Microchip Technology has been able to grow its dividends, or if the dividend might be cut."", ' See our latest analysis for Microchip Technology ', 'Dividends are typically paid out of company income, so if a company pays out more than it earned, its dividend is usually at a higher risk of being cut. Microchip Technology paid out a comfortable 37% of its profit last year. Yet cash flows are even more important than profits for assessing a dividend, so we need to see if the company generated enough cash to pay its distribution. Thankfully its dividend payments took up just 31% of the free cash flow it generated, which is a comfortable payout ratio.', ""It's positive to see that Microchip Technology's dividend is covered by both profits and cash flow, since this is generally a sign that the dividend is sustainable, and a lower payout ratio usually suggests a greater margin of safety before the dividend gets cut."", ""Click here to see the company's payout ratio, plus analyst estimates of its future dividends."", ""Businesses with strong growth prospects usually make the best dividend payers, because it's easier to grow dividends when earnings per share are improving. Investors love dividends, so if earnings fall and the dividend is reduced, expect a stock to be sold off heavily at the same time. That's why it's comforting to see Microchip Technology's earnings have been skyrocketing, up 51% per annum for the past five years. Microchip Technology is paying out less than half its earnings and cash flow, while simultaneously growing earnings per share at a rapid clip. This is a very favourable combination that can often lead to the dividend multiplying over the long term, if earnings grow and the company pays out a higher percentage of its earnings."", ""The main way most investors will assess a company's dividend prospects is by checking the historical rate of dividend growth. Microchip Technology has delivered an average of 9.8% per year annual increase in its dividend, based on the past 10 years of dividend payments. It's encouraging to see the company lifting dividends while earnings are growing, suggesting at least some corporate interest in rewarding shareholders."", ""Is Microchip Technology worth buying for its dividend? We love that Microchip Technology is growing earnings per share while simultaneously paying out a low percentage of both its earnings and cash flow. These characteristics suggest the company is reinvesting in growing its business, while the conservative payout ratio also implies a reduced risk of the dividend being cut in the future. It's a promising combination that should mark this company worthy of closer attention."", ""With that in mind, a critical part of thorough stock research is being aware of any risks that stock currently faces. To that end, you should learn about the 2 warning signs we've spotted with Microchip Technology (including 1 which is significant)."", ""Generally, we wouldn't recommend just buying the first dividend stock you see.

The financial tables within the filing indicate a solid liquidity position, with short-term liquidity at $19.2 billion and liquid assets at $182.6 billion as of December 31, 2023. MetLife's strategic focus on its Next Horizon strategy and a recent reorganization into six segments underscore its commitment to adaptability and value creation. This SWOT analysis delves into the strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats as presented in the 10-K filing, providing investors with a nuanced understanding of MetLife's strategic and financial positioning."", ""Global Diversification and Market Leadership: MetLife Inc's extensive global footprint, with leading market positions in the U.S., Japan, Latin America, and other regions, is a testament to its strength. The company's diversified business model not only mitigates risks associated with market volatility but also allows for capitalizing on growth opportunities across different geographies.

With an increase in short-term liquidity from $16.4 billion in 2022 to $19.2 billion in 2023, and a solid base of liquid assets, MetLife is well-equipped to meet its financial obligations and invest in growth initiatives. This financial stability is crucial for maintaining investor confidence and for the company's ability to weather economic downturns."", ""Competitive Pressures and Market Saturation: Despite its strong market position, MetLife faces intense competition from a multitude of insurance and financial services companies. Competitors with broader product offerings, more competitive pricing, or higher claims-paying ability ratings could potentially erode MetLife's market share. The company's group insurance products are subject to annual underwriting, which exposes it to the risk of losing customers to competitors offering more favorable terms. This competitive landscape necessitates continuous innovation and strategic marketing to retain and grow its customer base."", ""Regulatory and Operational Risks: MetLife operates in a heavily regulated industry, where changes in laws and regulations can significantly impact its business operations. The company must navigate a complex web of regulatory requirements across different markets, which can increase compliance costs and limit operational flexibility. Additionally, operational risks such as data breaches or system failures pose a threat to the company's reputation and financial stability."", ""Technological Advancements and E-Business Capabilities: The insurance industry is increasingly influenced by technology, and MetLife's ability to adapt and invest in e-business capabilities presents a significant opportunity. By harnessing data analytics, artificial intelligence, and digital platforms, MetLife can enhance customer experiences, streamline operations, and create more personalized product offerings. This technological edge can lead to increased efficiency, cost savings, and a stronger competitive position in the market."", ""Emerging Markets and Product Innovation: MetLife's presence in emerging markets such as Asia and Latin America offers avenues for growth as these regions experience rising incomes and increased demand for insurance products. The company's focus on innovation and customer-centric product development can help capture new segments and drive expansion. Additionally, the growing emphasis on environmental, social, and governance (ESG) factors opens up opportunities for MetLife to differentiate itself by integrating ESG considerations into its business strategy."", ""Economic Volatility and Interest Rate Fluctuations: As a global insurer and investor, MetLife is susceptible to financial market volatility and interest rate changes. These factors can affect the company's investment returns, capital positions, and overall profitability. Economic downturns or significant market disruptions could lead to increased claims and reduced demand for insurance products, thereby impacting MetLife's financial performance."", ""Regulatory Changes and Legal Risks: The insurance industry is subject to stringent and ever-evolving regulatory requirements. Changes in regulation, particularly those affecting the life insurance sector, can impose additional compliance costs and constrain business operations. Moreover, MetLife must contend with legal risks, including potential litigation and regulatory actions, which can result in financial penalties and damage to the company's reputation."", ""In conclusion, MetLife Inc's SWOT analysis reveals a company with a strong foundation, marked by its global diversification, robust financials, and market leadership. However, it must navigate competitive pressures, regulatory complexities, and economic uncertainties.

If you want to skip our detailed discussion about cash hoarding by nonbanking US firms, go to 7 Companies With the Most Cash Reserves.\xa0', 'A recent research by Harvard Business Review revealed that nonbanking US companies have increased their hoards of cash significantly post-pandemic. Traditionally, financial institutions such as banks keep large sums of cash in hand because they are in the business of lending money.\xa0', 'It does not make any apparent sense for nonbanking companies to hoard large piles of cash and collect only interest when cash could be invested for larger profits. According to the latest figures, the total cash reserves of the nonbanking US companies are a whopping $6.9 trillion, nearly equivalent to the GDPs of Germany and India combined. Today, cash represents $1 out of every $5 of total assets held by nonbanking US firms.\xa0', ""As we dig a little deeper, the reasons for keeping cash reserves become clearer. According to analysts, companies are hoarding cash because it helps them avoid premature failures that might decimate shareholder value. It allows them greater investment and operational flexibility. Economies around the world are increasingly becoming knowledge-based. The 'winner-take-all reward' model is quite prevalent in industries around the world. So, nonbanking firms are hoarding cash to utilize now-or-never opportunities.\xa0"", 'Cash also provides a cushion to bridge the timing mismatch between cash generation and sudden cash needs. In simple terms, it gives the firms the flexibility to quickly capitalize on profitable opportunities. However, there is more to this story.\xa0', 'Maintaining and building flexibility to capitalize on profitable opportunities is one side of the coin when it comes to hoarding cash. Higher cash reserves allow the companies to avoid taxes since they can only be collected on profits made by investments. The premise of investing cash in profitable investments rather than collecting only interest does not factor in the tax rate applied to those profits.', 'So, it would only make sense for companies to invest rather than hoard cash if the investment is significantly net positive, including tax. Even if the investment is net positive after taxation but without a significant margin, it makes more sense for companies to keep the cash in hand for a small cost and utilize it when a one-of-a-kind opportunity arises. Then, there is also an exception of firms with subjective valuation. These firms might struggle to access capital quickly, and so keep a large proportion of their assets as cash in hand.\xa0', 'It is quite interesting to note that multinationals whose value is generated primarily by their intellectual property are hoarding cash. Research by the professors at Kellogg School of Management found that reserves of Apple, Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), Alphabet, Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG), and Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) accounted for 92% of cash reserves that they could document.

The ex-dividend date is one business day before the record date, which is the cut-off date for shareholders to be present on the company's books to be eligible for a dividend payment. It is important to be aware of the ex-dividend date because any trade on the stock needs to have been settled on or before the record date. Accordingly, Moody's investors that purchase the stock on or after the 22nd of February will not receive the dividend, which will be paid on the 15th of March."", ""The company's next dividend payment will be US$0.85 per share, on the back of last year when the company paid a total of US$3.40 to shareholders.

This is why it's a relief to see Moody's earnings per share are up 5.2% per annum over the last five years."", ""Many investors will assess a company's dividend performance by evaluating how much the dividend payments have changed over time.

For lack of a better question. In other words, you know, I don't think many people looked at their coolers in their grocery stores and thought, man, I wish there were some ads there."", 'But, obviously, you saw an opportunity. How did that sort of come about?', ""ARSEN AVAKIAN: Hi. Good afternoon. Thanks for having me. Look, it's really not about the coolers or anything else."", 'The in-store marketing has been left as one of the last untouched areas for digitization. So technology inevitably is finding its way to bring the power of digital into a physical world.

You want to see information that's relevant to you, right? Your household sees the shows that are recommended to you that make sense to you."", ""Similarly, the search results that come up in your browser. In a very similar fashion, shoppers have been accustomed to static analog digital paper signage in their stores during their shopping. So we built a technology that just like Google or Netflix is understanding what people are interested in and when they are shopping in a store, and is providing a relevant content that is dynamic and it's appealing."", 'And it helps hopefully people to find products that appeal to their either budget constraints, or their dietary needs, or any other consideration that people have usually when they consider products in stores.', '- Arsen, what kind of demand are you hearing about from the advertisers, from the companies here? I know you guys have a deal with Kraft Heinz. What about other big food companies? How are they seeing this?', ""ARSEN AVAKIAN: Yeah, sure. We have over 200 active advertisers on the platform. The value is really nothing new that we're inventing in-store marketing has been done forever, right?"", 'All we did is we saw the need that, bringing that analog marketing into the new age of digital will give the marketers the ability to understand the performance of their advertising buys. It will help them to understand those micro segments and those opportunities to connect what I say intent with the content and drive the performance that is incremental to their businesses.', ""- And Arsen, what happens, though-- you're shopping, right? What happens if the item you see on the display isn't in the actual freezer?"", ""ARSEN AVAKIAN: Well, so for the form factor, you're referring to on the coolers and freezers. We've built a clever vision AI capability. So there are cameras on the back of the screens that are constantly scanning what products are on shelf and which ones are not."", ""And as a result of that, we're always able to tell the shoppers what's in stock, what's out of stock. And that also informs the brands if they should be promoting or not. I mean, if I'm out of Diet Coke, perhaps, I can connect with the shopper and promote the regular or Cherry Coke. And not let the competitor Pepsi take over, right? As an example."", ""So those are all different use cases.

And perhaps no two companies could be more impacted than Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) and Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL).', ""Microsoft jumped into the race in a big way last year when it took a large stake in OpenAI, the creator of ChatGPT. Microsoft's initial involvement with the company actually goes back to 2019, when it made a $1 billion investment in the AI specialist, but after ChatGP went live and gained a lot of attention, Microsoft significantly increased its investment and went all-in on OpenAI's technology."", ""Alphabet, meanwhile, has been spending on AI for years, but didn't really jump into using the technology until after Microsoft made its big push. At the moment, Microsoft is emerging as a clear AI leader, while investors are a bit more skeptical about AI's impact on Alphabet. Here's why they shouldn't be."", ""The biggest worry for Alphabet investors is the effect of AI on search. This skepticism showed up when the tech titan announced its most recent results. While Alphabet handily topped analysts' revenue and earnings estimates, the stock nonetheless fell after its strong report. The reason was that Google's 11% advertising revenue growth came in just shy of expectations. This fed into the narrative that its dominant position in search could be at risk."", ""Dig slightly under the surface, however, and revenue from Google Search and YouTube, which are both part of this segment, was quite strong. Their sales rose nearly 13% and 16%, respectively. The weakness came from Google Networks, its targeted ad service that serves ads to customers' websites and apps, which saw revenue decline 2%. Overall, Alphabet's core Google Search and YouTube properties performed quite well."", 'Despite some investor concerns about the impact of AI on Google Search, the reality is that the company is embracing the technological shift. It has been heavily investing in AI for years, and at the end of 2023, it launched a new series of Gemini AI models. It has already been experimenting with these models in search in the U.S. and has seen a big reduction in latency.', 'While there is a fear that AI could disrupt Google Search, it is much more likely it will be a huge benefit for the company. Why? Because Alphabet will find new ways to profit off of AI queries.', ""Surprisingly, Google displays ads at the top of its search results only about 20% of the time. These are generally searches where someone is actively looking to buy something, and they will likely continue to best be served by traditional linked-based search results that will only improve with AI. However, with the use of AI, Google will also be able to answer questions directly that are not designed for search, and it will have an opportunity to monetize these queries (something it hasn't been doing). It can create new types of ads that can be served to users looking for answers from AI, which would create a new revenue source for the company and a lot of potential growth."", ""Microsoft's Bing, meanwhile, has a much smaller share in search than Google, and it isn't a big part of Microsoft's overall business. On its fourth-quarter earnings call, the only mention of Bing from executives was that it took share, but nothing else was said. AI can only help Bing, but right now it does not look like much of a threat to Google. If Bing were making big strides, Microsoft's management would have talked much more about its search engine."", ""Microsoft's most successful deployment of AI thus far has been via its cloud service, Azure. Its OpenAI offerings are leading to both new customer additions and more AI consumption. Azure has a pay-as-you-go model, so as organizations use the feature more, Microsoft generates more revenue. That helped lead to outstanding 30% growth in Azure sales in fiscal Q2 (which ended in December)."", 'Google Cloud, meanwhile, had also been benefiting from AI. Cloud revenue soared 26% in the fourth quarter, which only slightly trailed the growth that Azure saw in the period. Alphabet credited AI features for helping Google Cloud win and expand a number of deals in Q4. Meanwhile, the company will continue to invest in AI to drive further cloud services growth.', ""Another area where Microsoft has seen good results has been with adding AI chatbots and assistants called Copilots to its various products. GitHub, its developer tool, has seen huge uptake following the introduction of a Copilot to its platform. In fiscal Q2, the platform's paid subscribers increased 30%, while GitHub revenue surged 40%."", ""The company also said that its Microsoft 365 Copilot was seeing strong adoption. The product helps with tasks like summarizing documents. It's still early, but Microsoft is excited by its initial reception, which appears to be much better than the response users gave its first assistant program, Clippy, when it was introduced back in 1996."", 'Meanwhile, Alphabet has recently introduced a number of new AI advancements, including a music creation tool called MusicFX and an image creation tool called ImageFX. These offerings differentiate themselves from the competition through keyword suggestions that let users move into adjacent categories.', 'Overall, I think Microsoft and Alphabet are attractive ways to play the AI revolution. And while they compete with each other in several areas, they can both be winners with AI.', ""Alphabet may not have the first-mover advantage in AI, but it also didn't have the first-mover advantage in search, either. What it did was get the technology right and become the dominant player in the space. Look for history to repeat itself."", ""Microsoft, meanwhile, has been at the forefront of AI. It's improving its products, with Azure and GitHub leading the way. However, it is incorporating AI throughout its offerings, and it has opportunities with the technology in other areas as well. For example, it will be fun to watch what the company does in the future with AI in the video gaming realm, where it is already a leader and just completed an acquisition of game publisher Activision Blizzard. This is an exciting time for Microsoft given its leadership and investment in OpenAI. Expect it to continue to ride the current AI trend to solid revenue growth in the years to come."", 'Between the two stocks, though, I prefer Alphabet. The reason: Its valuation is much cheaper. Microsoft trades at a trailing price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 37, while Alphabet sports a P/E of 25. Investors are also more skeptical of Alphabet, which means expectations are lower. Low expectations and a relatively cheap valuation are a nice combination when looking for attractive investments.', 'Should you invest $1,000 in Alphabet right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Alphabet, consider this:', 'The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\xa010 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Alphabet wasn’t one of them.

If you want to skip our detailed discussion about cash hoarding by nonbanking US firms, go to 7 Companies With the Most Cash Reserves.\xa0', 'A recent research by Harvard Business Review revealed that nonbanking US companies have increased their hoards of cash significantly post-pandemic. Traditionally, financial institutions such as banks keep large sums of cash in hand because they are in the business of lending money.\xa0', 'It does not make any apparent sense for nonbanking companies to hoard large piles of cash and collect only interest when cash could be invested for larger profits. According to the latest figures, the total cash reserves of the nonbanking US companies are a whopping $6.9 trillion, nearly equivalent to the GDPs of Germany and India combined. Today, cash represents $1 out of every $5 of total assets held by nonbanking US firms.\xa0', ""As we dig a little deeper, the reasons for keeping cash reserves become clearer. According to analysts, companies are hoarding cash because it helps them avoid premature failures that might decimate shareholder value. It allows them greater investment and operational flexibility. Economies around the world are increasingly becoming knowledge-based. The 'winner-take-all reward' model is quite prevalent in industries around the world. So, nonbanking firms are hoarding cash to utilize now-or-never opportunities.\xa0"", 'Cash also provides a cushion to bridge the timing mismatch between cash generation and sudden cash needs. In simple terms, it gives the firms the flexibility to quickly capitalize on profitable opportunities. However, there is more to this story.\xa0', 'Maintaining and building flexibility to capitalize on profitable opportunities is one side of the coin when it comes to hoarding cash. Higher cash reserves allow the companies to avoid taxes since they can only be collected on profits made by investments. The premise of investing cash in profitable investments rather than collecting only interest does not factor in the tax rate applied to those profits.', 'So, it would only make sense for companies to invest rather than hoard cash if the investment is significantly net positive, including tax. Even if the investment is net positive after taxation but without a significant margin, it makes more sense for companies to keep the cash in hand for a small cost and utilize it when a one-of-a-kind opportunity arises. Then, there is also an exception of firms with subjective valuation. These firms might struggle to access capital quickly, and so keep a large proportion of their assets as cash in hand.\xa0', 'It is quite interesting to note that multinationals whose value is generated primarily by their intellectual property are hoarding cash. Research by the professors at Kellogg School of Management found that reserves of Apple, Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), Alphabet, Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG), and Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) accounted for 92% of cash reserves that they could document. Naturally, all of these are tech companies and are also part of our top tech companies list.\xa0', 'All three companies are extensively involved in research and development. In fact, last year\xa0 Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) held off increasing the salaries of its employees, citing investment in AI as one of the reasons. It is worth noting that two of these companies, Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) and\xa0 Alphabet, Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) are in competition with each other for the development of AI models. Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) has invested heavily in Open AI, whereas Alphabet, Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) has invested in Antropic. It is quite apparent that both companies see the AI revolution as one of a kind opportunity that they want to capitalize on.\xa0', 'In 2018,\xa0 Apple, Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) set an ambitious goal to reach a net cash neutral position where any cash in hand is balanced by its total debt. However, last year, the company took drastic steps to decrease the pile of idle cash it was sitting on. Apple, Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) returned much of the cash to shareholders in the form of share buybacks and dividends.\xa0', 'It is worth noting here that despite all of the cash hoarding by nonbanking US companies, the financial sector and banking institutions have the most cash. This is apparent in our list as an overwhelming majority are financial institutions.\xa0', ""With that backdrop, let's look at the top 20 companies with the most cash reserves.\xa0"", 'A bank teller in a full-service office, counting and organizing cash.', ""For our list of the top \xa020 companies with the most cash reserves, we researched online for companies with significant 'cash on hand' in their balance sheets.

Shares up after earnings, there was an extra serving of guac for investors. Strong beats on the top, and bottom line with company results."", ""Matt Argersinger: Big burrito. I almost think they should call it like standard burrito [laughs] standard oil back in the day. This company is getting bigger, and getting bigger in a very profitable way Dylan. Look at 15% sales growth, 8.4% comps, which were way ahead of expectations, that's very impressive. More impressive though, actually, is that the sales Chipotle is making are increasingly more profitable for the company. If you look at the restaurant-level margin, that was up 140 basis points year over year in the quarter. Chipotle's overall operating margin was also up 80 basis points year over year. Adjusted earnings for share up 25%. The company opened 120 restaurants in the quarter. That was a record, and it included 110 Chipotlanes, which if you don't know that's Chipotle's word for stores that have drive-through, [laughs] but they call them Chipotlanes. Those have been very successful and very profitable for the company. They only started in 2019. These Chipotlanes have really contributed to the company's digital sales, which were up 36% in the quarter, really impressive. If you're a Chipotle shareholder, I'd say 2024 and beyond is looking pretty bright. On the conference call, CEO Brian Niccol, he reiterated the five key strategies he has for the business. One of those is accelerating store openings. So last year, 2023, they opened 271 restaurants. That was a record. This year, they're targeting between 285 and 315 openings, mostly in North America, and 80% of those stores will include a Chipotle. Long term, the company believes they can get to 7,000 stores, which is more than double that they have today. If each of those stores is more profitable as they continue to be, Chipotle is going to be a much more valuable company in the future, bigger burrito."", ""Emily Flippen: Chipotle has held up so much better than I ever expected it to over the last couple of years when so much of their sales growth was driven by things like price increases. I almost can't help but feel like, Chipotle is the burrito version of Icarus, who is just flying a little too close to the sun, and at some point, consumers are going to step back and say, I can't afford this anymore. To Chipotle's credit, that has not happened yet. Their ability to launch new products that upsell people, so you get the cheap chicken burrito if that's your thing, or you can pay for the carne asada, which is their special menu item at the moment. Their ability to upsell people who can't afford it is great. But I try to keep my expectations a little bit lower with Chipotle, because things have been so hot for so long, and we've seen other food establishments really struggle over the course of the past couple of years. So I like this stock, it continues to be a Motley Fool recommendation, but I always, as an investor, just try to temper my near-term expectations."", ""Dylan Lewis: I think the burrito that flies too close to the sun might be a case idea if you really want to get into the tortured metaphor. [laughs] I think that's where it starts to trend. One of the things that really jumped out to me just in an all-firing cylinders type quarter Matt was, you talked about the same-store sales growth, 8%, it wasn't price hikes, 7% growth in foot traffic. It seems like everything seems to be working for this business, is there anything that you're concerned about?"", ""Matt Argersinger: Well, yes, I think Emily made a great point. Restaurant concepts come and go, Chipotle has proven to be really just sustaining in its success. I would say one thing that stands out to me if I could be Armchair CEO for a day, they've done a lot of share repurchasing lately. Last year they bought back about 600 million, they've got another 400 million, they've earmarked for buybacks. But stock at all-time high, hey, those buybacks which came at lower prices, they've worked out so far. But if you look at the share count for Chipotle, it's down less than 1% over the last five years. It's a lot of money invested, shareholders really haven't got a huge benefit, and it's an expensive stock. Talk about flying close to the sun, it's over 60 times earnings. Just for context, and I know this isn't apples to apples, but take Starbucks, which also happens to run a pretty successful restaurant concept with similar margins to Chipotle. It has ten times the number of restaurants that Chipotle has, yet its market cap is only 40% bigger than Chipotle's. If I were CEO Brian Niccol, I'd stop the buybacks, and I'd consider paying a dividend. That's coming from me, of course, it's not surprising. But if Chipotle pulled a Zuckerberg, and just paid a 0.5% dividend, it would only cost them around 340 million a year. That's just over half of what they spent on buybacks last year, and the earnings per ratio would still be less than 25%. I just think Chipotle is a mature, established business, it's got great earnings disability. Dividends also have a wonderful way of exerting a little discipline on capital allocation over time. That would be my one message to CEO Brian Niccol, great job, start paying a dividend."", ""Dylan Lewis: Dividends are the new growth, that's the story we're trying to sell in the marketplace."", ""Matt Argersinger: In my world, that's definitely true though."", ""Dylan Lewis: One company that's probably not going to be issuing a dividend anytime soon, Spotify. We got results from the music streamer this week. Emily, I think the story with this company for a while has been beat a little bit by the growth monster and some of the restructuring that's been going on in the market, and adjusted expectations. But man, what a great past year for this company as you look at the financials and the stock performance."", ""Emily Flippen: Dividends are the new growth. Please, growth is the new growth.[laughs] Spotify saw Chipotle's quarter, and said, look, hold my burrito, let me show you what I can do. [laughs] It really was a 1, 2 punch for Spotify, which is to say two things have always been held on hold over them. Which is can they be profitable, can they expand margins, or can they grow fast enough? And the market has always either punished them for one or the other. Your revenue growth wasn't fast enough, your user growth wasn't fast enough. Or if the user growth and your revenue growth there, well, your profitability is not fast enough. If you're Dan Ek, the founder and CEO of Spotify, you're probably just scratching your head like, what do you want for me? Well, this is the quarter that investors wanted. They wanted to see, on the gross side, that double-digit growth of both monthly active users and paying subscribers, which both beat expectations, growing double digits in the quarter. Revenue growth was up 20%, largely due to a massive turnaround in their ad base business which is what investors wanted because the gross margins on their music streaming business were great are capped somewhere around 30% or so. They need those margins on the ad business to expand, to drive profitability, and they actually saw ad revenue reach an all-time high in the quarter, which was up 12% quarter over quarter, that is not year over year. Great execution on both sides, they continue to see strong engagements from their customers. Spotify wrapped, for anybody who's a Spotify listener, they had a 40% increase in engagement year over year. So a crazy amount of adoption there. Big picture, I still think that's going to be hard for Spotify to continue this all of execution. They've certainly been benefited by the recent turnaround and ad revenue. But if the economy stays strong, there's no reason to believe that Spotify won't either."", ""Dylan Lewis: Emily, you talked about the user engagement there and one of the things that Spotify did over the last year was unveil Audiobook offerings as part of the member benefit, the subscriber benefit for the service. The company now claims the title of Number 2 Audiobook provider behind Amazon's Audible. Are you surprised with how quickly they've been able to rise in the space?"", ""Emily Flippen: Not at all. Not to mention that they're providing 15 free hours of listening or free, theoretically, to people who are already paying subscribers. It's easy to understand how they got that adoption. But if I was Audible, I'd be shaking in my boots right now because Spotify was a decade late to the podcasting game after Apple, and they are the largest podcasting platform in the world. In my opinion, there's no reason to believe they can't repeat that magic with Audiobooks."", ""Dylan Lewis: We'll stick with the consumer-facing names and wrap the earning segment here with a discussion on Uber. Matt, this is not your older cousin's Uber. The days of growth at all costs are gone, the company reported Q4 results and its first-ever full-year profit."", ""Matt Argersinger: Yes, just like Meta, I think, early 2022, Amazon, and a few others, Uber said, you know what? We're done with the growth at all costs, as you said. It's really all about efficiency and profitability, and man, those efforts have really paid off. Last year, they paid off in the fourth quarter. Uber surpassed expectations on every front. If you look at revenue, mobility revenue, the core business, delivery revenue earnings, active platform customers grew 15% year over year, trips were up 24%, bookings were up 22% up 29% in the core mobility segment, which is really impressive. You mentioned the profitability. Income from operations 652 million, and for the first time on a full-year basis, Uber generated positive operating a gain of 1.1 billion, and positive gap earnings as well so really awesome, the only real negative in the report that I saw was there was a 17% decline in the freight business, which is very small. It's a relatively new business for Uber. It's not costing the company very much right now, but you wonder if that segment is ever going to get off the ground and how much it's going to cost to get there. Uber also has about 5.7 billion in net debt. I was surprised to see that number as high as it is. Interest expenses is eating into profits, if they get paid that debt down a little bit or if interest rates come down, they'll actually be a lot more profitable. Unfortunately, Uber generates a ton of free cash flow now, so they have room to pay that debt down if they want to."", ""Dylan Lewis: I want to take this to a similar spot that we just did with Chipotle. It's easy to look at a company at all-time highs and start to say, are we getting a little close here? Is it getting a little rich? Uber is at a $140 billion valuation at this point, people who have bought in early are now seeing the results, and seeing some gains. Matt, what do you make of the company at this point?"", ""Matt Argersinger: I think good companies, of course, are meant to make new all-time highs. I think Uber is selling off a little bit this week because it's had such a big run into these earnings. But this is what you want to see, and I think this is a situation where the turnaround is real, and this company is very dominant in what it does. I wouldn't be surprised to see higher highs in the near future."", ""Dylan Lewis: Coming up after the break, we're checking in on virtual gaming, and what the retail mall situation looks like.

A strong response in the real world to results from virtual world, gaming company Roblox. Emily, this is a business that has been bite a bit by the growth whims of the market and by some user trend issues. Is it back on track now?"", ""Emily Flippen: I think Roblox has been on track a for a long time and I feel like investors who thought that Roblox got off track were enthralled by its abnormal performance during the pandemic and then thought that they could extrapolate that level of engagement and trend out for the foreseeable future, even when kids weren't sitting on their computers at home or x-boxes at home all day and obviously that wasn't the case. But Roblox has been executing, in my opinion, in every way that they have been able to in their control since the pandemic ended and you'd be shocked if you weren't somebody who follows this company to see just how well engagement and user growth has stayed up.

That's an insane number of I'd say kids, but the audience has gotten increasingly older, but users who are actively playing on this platform every month and a lot of that growth has come internationally. Last quarter, most of that growth was driven by expansion in India and Japan. But even in North America, which is their highly monetizable user growth here in the United States and Canada, that was up 17% year for year. So there are still people who are flocking to this platform to engage and play games and that has created a really profitable cycle for Roblox. They had a 25% increase in bookings in the quarter, 20% growth in operating cash flow, which is big for them because as part of their investor day last year they said we're going to focus on profitability, still drive that growth, but you're going to see more cash flow and that's exactly what investors got."", ""Dylan Lewis: You mentioned the user count they're checking in at around 70 million at this point. We got some interesting total addressable market updates from management and some of the commentary, I want to go check them with you. CEO said we enter 2024 with even more conviction of being able to achieve our long term goal of attracting 1 billion daily active users with optimism and civility. Emily, I feel like anytime we get a total addressable market figure from management, we have to discount it a little bit. How much are you discounting that 1 billion?"", ""Emily Flippen: I'm discounting it pretty significantly, especially when it makes that 70 million feel so tiny and if you're a management team, I understand you want to have a big vision for your company moving forward. But I do think that investors should never just take the word of management, but do their own research, that is part of the investing process. Now, to be clear they don't need to have 1 billion users and I don't think they're going to get to a billion users but they don't need to have that many users to be a good investment from this point forward and I do think a lot of these hiding expectations actually come from the integration of things like AI onto their platform which as an investor doing my own research, I feel a lot more conviction and because of the immediate use cases that GPTs and other large language models provide for things like coding and development. To help people get their Pot games from idea in their head onto a platform where they can actually monetize them. We're seeing real ways that's executing today even without 1 billion active users."", 'Dylan Lewis: From the worlds built by ones and zeros to the ones built by brick and mortar. Matt, when we were talking about Chipotle earlier, the story was foot traffic is back, this week we got results from mall and outlet with Simon Property Group. How are things looking in that space?', 'Matt Argersinger: Things are looking pretty good. But let me ask you, Dylan, when was the last time you were at a mall?', 'Dylan Lewis: Over the holidays for about 20 minutes and I regretted the choice immediately.', ""Matt Argersinger: Emily, how about you? When's the last time you were at a mall."", ""Emily Flippen: I go to the mall every single weekend. I'm awful."", 'Matt Argersinger: Really?', 'Emily Flippen: I like to get my coffee and walk around and maybe shop a little bit, but mostly look at people.', ""Matt Argersinger: Well, OK, that's interesting. I visit my mom up in Massachusetts pretty regularly and don't ask me why, but she loves to go to the mall, so when I'm with her, we will go to the mall and I visited one back in November. Granted, it was during the holiday shopping period, but it was packed. In fact, a few of the stores felt like fire hazards truly and yes, it was a Simon Property mall. Simon, and when I say Simon I mean the company and its CEO David Simon, have been desperately trying to tell us over the past few years that despite e-commerce, despite this global pandemic that we had, malls are in fact not dead and Emily just confirmed that they are not dead because Emily's in her '20s and she's going to the mall every weekend. But you can see it in Simon's results. I mean, occupancy across Simon's portfolio, 95.8% at the end of 2023, up from 94.9%. Simon's base minimum rent was $56.82 per square foot. That's up from a year ago and then if you look at retail sales per square foot, these are Simon's tenants, the sales, they're reporting $743 per square foot for the full year. Just slightly below where they were in 2022 so the consumer is holding up really well. If you look at the company level earnings funds from operations, which is a REIT metric for cash flow up 8.5% to $3.69 in the quarter. To top it off guys, Simon raised its quarterly dividend by $0.05 to $1.95. That is the ninth time, the ninth time that Simon has raised its dividend since 2020, just four years ago, so really impressive all around. Somehow this stock trades for 12 times FFO per share, pays a 5.5% dividend. I don't think it stays that cheap for long, especially with Emily Flippen going to the mall every weekend, so check out Simon Property Group, cheap stock cheap."", ""Dylan Lewis: We're going to wrap up our earnings takes by looking at Enphase Energy. Emily, a massive post earnings move from the company. Immediately after the company posted earnings, shares were up 20%. What had the market so excited about the solar stock?"", ""Emily Flippen: Well, I don't know if it was the 70% decline sequentially in Europe or the 35% decline sequentially in the United States that had investors very excited. I'm saying this very tongue and cheek. Obviously, those are not strong numbers but the commentary that management provided around the demand structure for Enphase which does create micro inverters for things like solar panels as well as batteries for stolge storage, the commentary was to say that the market is going to stabilize. So now a lot of this demand is driven by external factors, so we're talking about government incentives, conflict globally, as well as things like interest rates because a lot of people choose to finance their installation of solar projects. All of those things have these kind of external factors that have pushed down demand and sell through for the company over the course of the past year. But that management that things may be normalizing alongside that expectation, that maybe interest rates come down a bit over the course of the next year I think has the market a bit more excited after a year of pessimism."", ""Dylan Lewis: So maybe the outlook isn't quite as cloudy, is that the take?"", ""Emily Flippen: Yes, and a lot of their near term outlook is because their partners or distribution partners are working through existing inventory levels, so they're not shipping through new products. But that doesn't mean the actual sell through on the other end is as bad as it initially looks this quarter. So I do think that the expectation is for a little bit of normalization heading into 2024."", ""Dylan Lewis: Emily, this is a name that I'm not super familiar with, and so I was getting up to speed before we headed into taping. You mentioned a whole host of different macro factors there, is this one of those companies that investors just have to understand, there are some larger whims that are going to sweep up the adoption and sell through on the product?"", ""Emily Flippen: Yeah, the biggest thing to understand for somebody who's not familiar with this space is that solar is by far the cheapest form of electricity and energy is expensive especially for areas like Europe for instance, and only getting more expensive over time. So the long term tailwinds should be there for the demand and installation of solar projects, even if the near term is extremely lumpy, as you mentioned, due to these external circumstances, so don't write off this business just base out those headline numbers."", ""Dylan Lewis: Emily, Matt. We're going to see you guys a little bit later in the show up next, we've got tips for handling money issues, whether you're a tight wad or spendthrift stay right here, you're listening to Motley Fool Money."", ""Welcome back to Motley Fool Money. I'm Dylan Lewis. Valentine's Day is coming up and in fact, this is your PSA. If you don't have anything planned yet for the person in your life, you still have time. Go get after it to help our listeners in all matters, gift giving and money and relationships. My colleague, Deidre Woollard, caught up with Scott Rick, a marketing professor at the University of Michigan, and the author of Tightwads and Spendthrifts, navigating the money minefield in real relationships, they dug into the two major camps of savers and spenders, how payment salience is making things a bit tougher for everyone, and Rex for great gifts."", ""Deidre Woollard: Well, this book was really fascinating to me. I think I learned a little bit about myself and in the process, but let's start with the basics. What is a tightwad and how does it compare to someone who maybe is just a little frugal?"", ""Scott Rick: They will look quite similar on paper of a tightwad and a highly frugal person. But a tightwad is someone who often has money to spend and they know there are things that would make them and the people around them happier. But the prospect of spending the money makes them very anxious and they just can't make it happen. The thought of spending the money keeps them from buying a lot of the stuff that they realize would be in their best interest. This can be very frustrating for them, and the people around them can lead to a lot of internal conflict. Again, it can look good on paper, but it's not always a pleasant internal situation. Whereas a highly frugal person that's quite different. Frugal people, they save a lot, they're happy. They believe in saving. They love reusing items until they're just completely worn out. They're not overburdened with a lot of desire for new material objects. They're just living very conservatively and loving it. Frugal people tend to be quite happy whereas tightwads, that's a little trickier."", ""Deidre Woollard: It sounds like there's some anxiety about the spending that, that sort of defines what a tightwad is."", 'Scott Rick: Yes. Anxiety, distress. Those are the key feelings that keep them from spending what they think they should.', ""Deidre Woollard: Now on the other side, the flip side, this spendthrift people think of this as maybe compulsive shopping, but this is not just someone who doesn't just spend, but it sounds like they almost don't think about money at all. Is it the opposite of the anxiousness about money?"", ""Scott Rick: Well, I think they realize they're not kind of doing what they should be doing. If you ask them like, oh, here's like a fun new product, when do you think you'll get tired of this? They're actually better at knowing when they're going to get tired of something than a tightwad is. They just care less about those future outcomes. They're very present oriented, living in the moment, they're aware of implications and negative implications of their shopping today. They're just not so constrained by those thoughts, that awareness of what happens later. They're living in the moment where a tightwad will sometimes they don't shop for things that they know they need. Spendthrifts will shop for not only what they need, but also what they might need some day, I'm at the store, I'm buying clothes for work. There's a fun velvet jacket that might be fun for a fancy party. I'm not invited to such a party, but what if I am some day? I'd rather be looking at it than looking for it, is the spendthrift ideology."", ""Deidre Woollard: In terms of how that works with like a compulsive shopping or hoarding, it sounds like it's slightly different because they don't need to amass as much stuff, they just don't think about it as much."", ""Scott Rick: Things like compulsive shopping. There's research showing that is often related to depression and can be treated with anti-depressants and therapy. There is a more therapeutic approach to tamping down compulsive shopping. I think hoarding is in that ballpark. Whereas I don't think something like an anti-depressant would have much of an effect on spendthrift. That doesn't seem to be what's driving them to spend so much. It's just someone cut the brakes on the car, they just don't have the stop signal so good."", 'Deidre Woollard: It sounds like the spendthrift is happier than the tightwad overall.', ""Scott Rick: Well, they're both conflicted. That's what they have in common that they're both torn. There are people in the middle of this distribution, we call them unconflicted consumers, and they are in the Goldilock zone, and not too little, not too much, and they're happy with what they spend. But it's the two extremes, the tightwads and Spendthrifts. There's a lot of regret there. They're kicking themselves, but for very different reasons."", ""Deidre Woollard: We've got a quiz in the book. I don't want to go through the whole thing, but if you're trying to assess where you might fall on that spectrum, what are some quick questions you can ask yourself?"", ""Scott Rick: Well, imagine you go to the mall and are you kicking yourself afterwards for either not buying something that you thought you should, that's a tightwad thought or are you like, well, I probably shouldn't have bought, that's the spendthrift. The scale has questions like that. Who do you relate to more? What perspective? I see this in my own life. I'm a spendthrift. I'm married to a tightwad, and my wife used to come home from shopping, what she called shopping. But she would tell me about the things she wished she bought and I was like, why didn't you buy the thing? My goodness you could use that. Those regrets is what the scale tries to tap into."", ""Deidre Woollard: Well, on either side you've got these ways that you can mitigate your own tendencies. One of the things you talk about in the book is the way that spending has shifted and just the way that it's frictionless. You talk about this thing that I thought was really interesting called payment salience, which is just this awareness of the fact that you're spending, even when you're just swiping a card or tapping something on your phone. How can you reduce or increase this to mitigate your natural tendencies?"", ""Scott Rick: Certainly retailers are doing everything they can to reduce payment salience and the emphasis, and they're artists like Amazon, it's amazing. If you're a tightwad, it's just putting yourself in those places where you can distract yourself and not pay too much attention to the money leaving your possession. The real challenges for the spendthrifts, they're on their own to ramp up payment salience, but it's doable. It's possible. When I was in grad school and I had no money, I had to turn myself into a temporary tightwad. I would pay with cash whenever possible, I would make sure I felt pain at the ATM reducing my account balance and then pain at the store when paying with cash. Just trying to put up these speed bumps, all this friction like paying attention to the money I was spending. When I would spend with a card, I would get the receipt, take it home, and go into my Excel file and keep track of each purchase. That was painful to look at all this money being spent. I was just trying to ramp up how obvious it was, the money leaving my possession and so that's the challenge for spendthrift. You're on your own, retailers are not looking to help you."", ""Deidre Woollard: [laughs] Definitely not. I think it's interesting that we all have these tendencies and then we have to work against our own nature to get us more to the middle ground."", 'Scott Rick: Yes, exactly. But we can learn from people trying to influence us. I think there are things we can do to influence ourselves, to reshape how we think about choices and what reminders or speed bumps we put in our own environment so we can become like self marketers, so to speak.', ""Deidre Woollard: Well, you mentioned that you're the spendthrift, you're married to the tightwad, I think I might be the tightwad, married to the spendthrift. You've done some research on whether or not these different types are likely to marry. What did you discover? How does some of this play out?"", ""Scott Rick: Normally, we marry ourselves. We like most things about ourselves and we look for that in other people. But if there is something we don't like about ourselves, we're not necessarily looking for that in someone else. It can really shine a uncomfortable spotlight on the issue. If I see someone who approaches money the same way I do, and I don't like how I approach money, it's like, is that what I look like? Is that what I act like? It can really be a real turn off at first, we find that indeed tightwads and spendthrifts are more likely to marry each other than they are to marry someone like themselves. We think that's fun at first, but there are lots of things that are fun at first, that are less fun in a marriage when the decisions are more important. When there are higher stakes. It is one of these so called fatal attractions. If I'm a shy person, I might find someone really outgoing, fun and exciting at first. But eventually I do need my quiet time and it might get old over time. This seems to be one of those patterns."", 'Deidre Woollard: What happens if the two alike types marry each other? If a tightwad and a tightwad get together, is it just a big grim and if a spendthrift and spendthrift get together, do they just bankrupt themselves?', ""Scott Rick: Well, I would say that the two spendthrift pairing is the most dangerous and it can be financially explosive. But certainly if they have the money to spend, that could be quite a fun life, but that is a very precarious pairing. Now to tightwads, if you're just looking to maximize the money in the home, you want to put as many tightwads in the home as possible, for sure. They are usually living a pretty stable comfortable life. It's not necessarily an exciting one or filled with much adventure, or novelty, or fresh experience. They can work at that but left to their own devices, it can be, not for everyone, let's say, a little quiet. I do think a mismatched couple has the most potential for happiness, because I think this balance can work but it takes some efforts."", ""Deidre Woollard: Sounds like it may also take some self awareness too. If you don't know which side you're on, then the other person's spending attitude can just seem wrong and stupid."", 'Scott Rick: Oh yes. It\'s good to do things like take this scale, the tightwad-spendthrift scale, or there are other questionnaires, things to reflect on what you\'re up to, and try to think about what your partner, how they might respond, see if you can guess their responses. But yeah, it\'s good to know where everyone\'s coming from. Like I might get a gift from my spouse that seems really cheap and like, ""Oh my God, you don\'t love me, do you?"" But I need to keep in mind like, ""Oh, you really find it painful to spend money."" It\'s not your feelings about me, it\'s just your nature, it\'s in you. It helps me interpret how you spend and what you think about me. It\'s good to keep in mind where everyone\'s coming from.', ""Deidre Woollard: We're recording this near Valentine's Day and this is one of those gifting land mines. This is worse than Christmas, in my opinion. You talked earlier about tightwads and spendthrifts and understanding each other's gifting language. How do we get through this holiday and give appropriate gifts without causing ourselves a little bit of pain?"", ""Scott Rick: Well, first of all, I suggest don't ask the other person what they want."", 'Deidre Woollard: Oh, yeah. Never works well.', 'Scott Rick: Well, yeah and it can hurt their feelings. You can ask in like the night before, like, ""You want something, are we doing Valentine\'s this year?"" No, we don\'t. But really, the gift giving is a chance to show the person, ""Oh, I see you, I know you, I understand you"". Giving a good gift, it takes time. You got to be curious about your partner and, and take time to learn about them and ask them what are they excited about? What are they worried about? What are their hopes and dreams? That kind of thing, so there\'s that. Also, I would say that a good gift requires sacrifice. I need to know that this wasn\'t super easy for you to find or think of or obtain. I want to get the sense that you didn\'t just pick this up at CVS on your way home. If a spendthrift wants to sacrifice, it\'s not going to be through spending money because if I\'m married to a spendthrift, I know they find spending money, it\'s no big deal. Oh, they get me an iPad. It\'s nice, but they just got themselves the new iPhone. They do this kind of stuff all the time, it\'s water off their back. They have to do something that takes time and effort. They got to plan a weekend. They got to track down a rare Taylor Swift album autograph or something that is hard to find. They got to put in the efforts. A tightwad, it\'s a little different. If I know a tightwad doesn\'t like spending money and they spend a bunch of money, that\'s a sacrifice. They\'ve endured something painful. Now, it still has to be a thoughtful gift, but for them, spending money can be a real act of self sacrifice. Yeah, I would just say keep in mind the gift will be interpreted based on what the recipient knows about you and how you approach money, so you have to sacrifice accordingly.', ""Dylan Lewis: Listeners, you can catch Scott Rick's thoughts on money and relationships on X. He is @ScottIanRick. A special shout out to the person in my life who makes me a little bit less of a tightwad, Jess. Listeners, we hope everyone out there has someone that loves them and makes them revisit their own money habits. Coming up after the break, Matt Argersinger and Emily Flippen return with a couple of stocks on their radar. Stay right here. You're listening to Motley Fool Money [MUSIC] As always, people in the program may have interests in the stocks they talk about and the Motley Fool may have formal recommendations for or against. Snow buyers, anything based solely on what you hear. I'm Dylan Lewis joined again by Emily Flippen and Matt Argersinger. Matt, Emily, we're going to talk radar stocks in a second. But this week's interview ahead of Valentine's Day was all about savers and spenders and the relationships with money within relationships. I'm going to force you both to put yourself into one bucket, tightwad or spendthrift, Emily, which one is it?"", ""Emily Flippen: This is so hard because I think the world is created of grays. But I guess if I have to choose, I would maybe put myself in the tightwad bucket and that bucket. But that's not because I don't like to spend, I think in my relationship, I'm actually the bigger spender of us. But it is because I keep a spreadsheet of all of our finances. I know where every penny is constantly and if that's not the definition of an anxious attachment to money, I don't know what is."", 'Dylan Lewis: Matt, what about you?', ""Matt Argersinger: I also have spreadsheets, but I am very much a spendthrift, especially these days, since I've had a son. I realized that experiences are very important. We just got back from a really expensive ski trip, but we loved every second of it. Really, when it comes to experiences, life events, things like that, I'm doling out the money as fast as I can. Tightwad in other places but not when it comes to that."", ""Dylan Lewis: Let's get over to stocks on our radar. Our man behind the glass is going to hit you with a question. Emily, you're up first. What are you looking at this week?"", ""Emily Flippen: Snapchat is on my radar this week. Now, look, when you talk about radar stocks, there's lots of reasons why a business could be on our radar. Sometimes we're buying it hand over fist, sometimes we're interested in a factor. At this case, Snapchat's on my radar because it's down more than 30% after their fourth quarter results. It's certainly worth talking about because that's a pretty massive reaction to what it's otherwise a pretty decent quarter from Snapchat. They had strong user growth, they had decent cost of management executed on a lot of the vision that management had communicated earlier this year. But I think the reason why we're seeing this massive reaction is just because the ad business for so many other companies has been so strong and to see that weakness coming out of Snapchat, and especially attributing a lot of that to global conflict while other businesses are just not saying the same thing, could highlight just a systematic weakness that exists in Snapchat's platform. Which I've always said, I think reduces their ability to monetize as effectively as other platforms. A little bit of the Twitter problem facing snap chat today, so it's on my radar for that reason alone."", 'Dylan Lewis: Dan, a question about a maybe bearish, maybe careful watch stock on Snap?', ""Dan Boyd: Emily, can somebody please take this company private so we don't have to hear about how crappy it's doing ever again?"", ""Emily Flippen: I don't know, that Snapchat+ subscription. There's something there."", ""Dylan Lewis: [laughs] It doesn't sound like Dan's going to be signing up for that one. But we'll see, maybe we can convince him. Matt, what's on your radar this week?"", ""Matt Argersinger: Well, I think Dan likes coffee. I think he does and so Starbucks is on my radar, ticker SBUX. Company is off to a bit of a slow start to its fiscal year. They hit the low end of their comps and revenue growth in that first quarter. But I think there are three things happening that are pretty compelling. One, really focused on efficiency these days and it's really paying off,290 basis point improvement in operating margin in the quarter, operating profits were up 25%. Second, this is still very much a global growth story. China is still a big market for them, they're just getting started in India. I think there's a viable path for them to double their international stores within a decade. Then third, Starbucks bought back almost $1.4 billion worth of stock in this quarter. That was more than they were purchased in all of fiscal 2023. Management thinks the stock is cheap, I think it's cheap as well. I don't think it stays below $100 for a share for too long. We just recommend the stock in our dividend investor service, I got to give that a shout out. Starbucks is one that I'm paying very close attention to."", 'Dylan Lewis: Dan, a question about Starbucks.', ""Dan Boyd: At risk of alienating all of the listeners I haven't already alienated yet, Matty, I actually prefer tea to coffee."", ""Dylan Lewis: Oh my gosh. That's a shock to the dozens of listeners."", ""Dan Boyd: Yeah. But what a different company than Snap. Starbucks, they seem to be doing really strong, it's something else. Host Emeritus, Chris Hill was always talking about how coffee isn't going anywhere and it looks like that's the truth for Starbucks."", ""Dylan Lewis: Yeah, I think you're right. I think the addiction thesis is a strong thesis, when it comes to people's daily habits and caffeine. That's going to do it for this week's Motley Fool Money radio show.

Look at 15% sales growth, 8.4% comps, which were way ahead of expectations, that's very impressive. More impressive though, actually, is that the sales Chipotle is making are increasingly more profitable for the company. If you look at the restaurant-level margin, that was up 140 basis points year over year in the quarter. Chipotle's overall operating margin was also up 80 basis points year over year. Adjusted earnings for share up 25%. The company opened 120 restaurants in the quarter. That was a record, and it included 110 Chipotlanes, which if you don't know that's Chipotle's word for stores that have drive-through, [laughs] but they call them Chipotlanes. Those have been very successful and very profitable for the company. They only started in 2019. These Chipotlanes have really contributed to the company's digital sales, which were up 36% in the quarter, really impressive. If you're a Chipotle shareholder, I'd say 2024 and beyond is looking pretty bright. On the conference call, CEO Brian Niccol, he reiterated the five key strategies he has for the business. One of those is accelerating store openings. So last year, 2023, they opened 271 restaurants. That was a record. This year, they're targeting between 285 and 315 openings, mostly in North America, and 80% of those stores will include a Chipotle. Long term, the company believes they can get to 7,000 stores, which is more than double that they have today. If each of those stores is more profitable as they continue to be, Chipotle is going to be a much more valuable company in the future, bigger burrito."", ""Emily Flippen: Chipotle has held up so much better than I ever expected it to over the last couple of years when so much of their sales growth was driven by things like price increases. I almost can't help but feel like, Chipotle is the burrito version of Icarus, who is just flying a little too close to the sun, and at some point, consumers are going to step back and say, I can't afford this anymore. To Chipotle's credit, that has not happened yet. Their ability to launch new products that upsell people, so you get the cheap chicken burrito if that's your thing, or you can pay for the carne asada, which is their special menu item at the moment. Their ability to upsell people who can't afford it is great. But I try to keep my expectations a little bit lower with Chipotle, because things have been so hot for so long, and we've seen other food establishments really struggle over the course of the past couple of years. So I like this stock, it continues to be a Motley Fool recommendation, but I always, as an investor, just try to temper my near-term expectations."", ""Dylan Lewis: I think the burrito that flies too close to the sun might be a case idea if you really want to get into the tortured metaphor. [laughs] I think that's where it starts to trend. One of the things that really jumped out to me just in an all-firing cylinders type quarter Matt was, you talked about the same-store sales growth, 8%, it wasn't price hikes, 7% growth in foot traffic. It seems like everything seems to be working for this business, is there anything that you're concerned about?"", ""Matt Argersinger: Well, yes, I think Emily made a great point. Restaurant concepts come and go, Chipotle has proven to be really just sustaining in its success. I would say one thing that stands out to me if I could be Armchair CEO for a day, they've done a lot of share repurchasing lately. Last year they bought back about 600 million, they've got another 400 million, they've earmarked for buybacks. But stock at all-time high, hey, those buybacks which came at lower prices, they've worked out so far. But if you look at the share count for Chipotle, it's down less than 1% over the last five years. It's a lot of money invested, shareholders really haven't got a huge benefit, and it's an expensive stock. Talk about flying close to the sun, it's over 60 times earnings. Just for context, and I know this isn't apples to apples, but take Starbucks, which also happens to run a pretty successful restaurant concept with similar margins to Chipotle. It has ten times the number of restaurants that Chipotle has, yet its market cap is only 40% bigger than Chipotle's. If I were CEO Brian Niccol, I'd stop the buybacks, and I'd consider paying a dividend. That's coming from me, of course, it's not surprising. But if Chipotle pulled a Zuckerberg, and just paid a 0.5% dividend, it would only cost them around 340 million a year. That's just over half of what they spent on buybacks last year, and the earnings per ratio would still be less than 25%. I just think Chipotle is a mature, established business, it's got great earnings disability. Dividends also have a wonderful way of exerting a little discipline on capital allocation over time. That would be my one message to CEO Brian Niccol, great job, start paying a dividend."", ""Dylan Lewis: Dividends are the new growth, that's the story we're trying to sell in the marketplace."", ""Matt Argersinger: In my world, that's definitely true though."", ""Dylan Lewis: One company that's probably not going to be issuing a dividend anytime soon, Spotify. We got results from the music streamer this week. Emily, I think the story with this company for a while has been beat a little bit by the growth monster and some of the restructuring that's been going on in the market, and adjusted expectations. But man, what a great past year for this company as you look at the financials and the stock performance."", ""Emily Flippen: Dividends are the new growth. Please, growth is the new growth.[laughs] Spotify saw Chipotle's quarter, and said, look, hold my burrito, let me show you what I can do. [laughs] It really was a 1, 2 punch for Spotify, which is to say two things have always been held on hold over them. Which is can they be profitable, can they expand margins, or can they grow fast enough? And the market has always either punished them for one or the other. Your revenue growth wasn't fast enough, your user growth wasn't fast enough. Or if the user growth and your revenue growth there, well, your profitability is not fast enough. If you're Dan Ek, the founder and CEO of Spotify, you're probably just scratching your head like, what do you want for me? Well, this is the quarter that investors wanted. They wanted to see, on the gross side, that double-digit growth of both monthly active users and paying subscribers, which both beat expectations, growing double digits in the quarter. Revenue growth was up 20%, largely due to a massive turnaround in their ad base business which is what investors wanted because the gross margins on their music streaming business were great are capped somewhere around 30% or so. They need those margins on the ad business to expand, to drive profitability, and they actually saw ad revenue reach an all-time high in the quarter, which was up 12% quarter over quarter, that is not year over year. Great execution on both sides, they continue to see strong engagements from their customers. Spotify wrapped, for anybody who's a Spotify listener, they had a 40% increase in engagement year over year. So a crazy amount of adoption there. Big picture, I still think that's going to be hard for Spotify to continue this all of execution. They've certainly been benefited by the recent turnaround and ad revenue. But if the economy stays strong, there's no reason to believe that Spotify won't either."", ""Dylan Lewis: Emily, you talked about the user engagement there and one of the things that Spotify did over the last year was unveil Audiobook offerings as part of the member benefit, the subscriber benefit for the service. The company now claims the title of Number 2 Audiobook provider behind Amazon's Audible. Are you surprised with how quickly they've been able to rise in the space?"", ""Emily Flippen: Not at all. Not to mention that they're providing 15 free hours of listening or free, theoretically, to people who are already paying subscribers. It's easy to understand how they got that adoption. But if I was Audible, I'd be shaking in my boots right now because Spotify was a decade late to the podcasting game after Apple, and they are the largest podcasting platform in the world. In my opinion, there's no reason to believe they can't repeat that magic with Audiobooks."", ""Dylan Lewis: We'll stick with the consumer-facing names and wrap the earning segment here with a discussion on Uber. Matt, this is not your older cousin's Uber. The days of growth at all costs are gone, the company reported Q4 results and its first-ever full-year profit."", ""Matt Argersinger: Yes, just like Meta, I think, early 2022, Amazon, and a few others, Uber said, you know what? We're done with the growth at all costs, as you said. It's really all about efficiency and profitability, and man, those efforts have really paid off. Last year, they paid off in the fourth quarter. Uber surpassed expectations on every front. If you look at revenue, mobility revenue, the core business, delivery revenue earnings, active platform customers grew 15% year over year, trips were up 24%, bookings were up 22% up 29% in the core mobility segment, which is really impressive. You mentioned the profitability. Income from operations 652 million, and for the first time on a full-year basis, Uber generated positive operating a gain of 1.1 billion, and positive gap earnings as well so really awesome, the only real negative in the report that I saw was there was a 17% decline in the freight business, which is very small. It's a relatively new business for Uber. It's not costing the company very much right now, but you wonder if that segment is ever going to get off the ground and how much it's going to cost to get there. Uber also has about 5.7 billion in net debt. I was surprised to see that number as high as it is. Interest expenses is eating into profits, if they get paid that debt down a little bit or if interest rates come down, they'll actually be a lot more profitable. Unfortunately, Uber generates a ton of free cash flow now, so they have room to pay that debt down if they want to."", ""Dylan Lewis: I want to take this to a similar spot that we just did with Chipotle. It's easy to look at a company at all-time highs and start to say, are we getting a little close here? Is it getting a little rich? Uber is at a $140 billion valuation at this point, people who have bought in early are now seeing the results, and seeing some gains. Matt, what do you make of the company at this point?"", ""Matt Argersinger: I think good companies, of course, are meant to make new all-time highs. I think Uber is selling off a little bit this week because it's had such a big run into these earnings. But this is what you want to see, and I think this is a situation where the turnaround is real, and this company is very dominant in what it does. I wouldn't be surprised to see higher highs in the near future."", ""Dylan Lewis: Coming up after the break, we're checking in on virtual gaming, and what the retail mall situation looks like.

I'm Dylan Lewis joined over the airwaves by Emily Flippen and Matt Argersinger. We're going to keep the earnings focus going. A strong response in the real world to results from virtual world, gaming company Roblox. Emily, this is a business that has been bite a bit by the growth whims of the market and by some user trend issues. Is it back on track now?"", ""Emily Flippen: I think Roblox has been on track a for a long time and I feel like investors who thought that Roblox got off track were enthralled by its abnormal performance during the pandemic and then thought that they could extrapolate that level of engagement and trend out for the foreseeable future, even when kids weren't sitting on their computers at home or x-boxes at home all day and obviously that wasn't the case. But Roblox has been executing, in my opinion, in every way that they have been able to in their control since the pandemic ended and you'd be shocked if you weren't somebody who follows this company to see just how well engagement and user growth has stayed up. In this past quarter they saw 22% increase in their daily active users. That brings them to just under 70 million. That's an insane number of I'd say kids, but the audience has gotten increasingly older, but users who are actively playing on this platform every month and a lot of that growth has come internationally. Last quarter, most of that growth was driven by expansion in India and Japan. But even in North America, which is their highly monetizable user growth here in the United States and Canada, that was up 17% year for year. So there are still people who are flocking to this platform to engage and play games and that has created a really profitable cycle for Roblox. They had a 25% increase in bookings in the quarter, 20% growth in operating cash flow, which is big for them because as part of their investor day last year they said we're going to focus on profitability, still drive that growth, but you're going to see more cash flow and that's exactly what investors got."", ""Dylan Lewis: You mentioned the user count they're checking in at around 70 million at this point. We got some interesting total addressable market updates from management and some of the commentary, I want to go check them with you. CEO said we enter 2024 with even more conviction of being able to achieve our long term goal of attracting 1 billion daily active users with optimism and civility. Emily, I feel like anytime we get a total addressable market figure from management, we have to discount it a little bit. How much are you discounting that 1 billion?"", ""Emily Flippen: I'm discounting it pretty significantly, especially when it makes that 70 million feel so tiny and if you're a management team, I understand you want to have a big vision for your company moving forward. But I do think that investors should never just take the word of management, but do their own research, that is part of the investing process. Now, to be clear they don't need to have 1 billion users and I don't think they're going to get to a billion users but they don't need to have that many users to be a good investment from this point forward and I do think a lot of these hiding expectations actually come from the integration of things like AI onto their platform which as an investor doing my own research, I feel a lot more conviction and because of the immediate use cases that GPTs and other large language models provide for things like coding and development. To help people get their Pot games from idea in their head onto a platform where they can actually monetize them. We're seeing real ways that's executing today even without 1 billion active users."", 'Dylan Lewis: From the worlds built by ones and zeros to the ones built by brick and mortar. Matt, when we were talking about Chipotle earlier, the story was foot traffic is back, this week we got results from mall and outlet with Simon Property Group. How are things looking in that space?', 'Matt Argersinger: Things are looking pretty good. But let me ask you, Dylan, when was the last time you were at a mall?', 'Dylan Lewis: Over the holidays for about 20 minutes and I regretted the choice immediately.', ""Matt Argersinger: Emily, how about you? When's the last time you were at a mall."", ""Emily Flippen: I go to the mall every single weekend. I'm awful."", 'Matt Argersinger: Really?', 'Emily Flippen: I like to get my coffee and walk around and maybe shop a little bit, but mostly look at people.', ""Matt Argersinger: Well, OK, that's interesting. I visit my mom up in Massachusetts pretty regularly and don't ask me why, but she loves to go to the mall, so when I'm with her, we will go to the mall and I visited one back in November. Granted, it was during the holiday shopping period, but it was packed. In fact, a few of the stores felt like fire hazards truly and yes, it was a Simon Property mall. Simon, and when I say Simon I mean the company and its CEO David Simon, have been desperately trying to tell us over the past few years that despite e-commerce, despite this global pandemic that we had, malls are in fact not dead and Emily just confirmed that they are not dead because Emily's in her '20s and she's going to the mall every weekend. But you can see it in Simon's results. I mean, occupancy across Simon's portfolio, 95.8% at the end of 2023, up from 94.9%. Simon's base minimum rent was $56.82 per square foot. That's up from a year ago and then if you look at retail sales per square foot, these are Simon's tenants, the sales, they're reporting $743 per square foot for the full year. Just slightly below where they were in 2022 so the consumer is holding up really well. If you look at the company level earnings funds from operations, which is a REIT metric for cash flow up 8.5% to $3.69 in the quarter. To top it off guys, Simon raised its quarterly dividend by $0.05 to $1.95. That is the ninth time, the ninth time that Simon has raised its dividend since 2020, just four years ago, so really impressive all around. Somehow this stock trades for 12 times FFO per share, pays a 5.5% dividend. I don't think it stays that cheap for long, especially with Emily Flippen going to the mall every weekend, so check out Simon Property Group, cheap stock cheap."", ""Dylan Lewis: We're going to wrap up our earnings takes by looking at Enphase Energy. Emily, a massive post earnings move from the company. Immediately after the company posted earnings, shares were up 20%. What had the market so excited about the solar stock?"", ""Emily Flippen: Well, I don't know if it was the 70% decline sequentially in Europe or the 35% decline sequentially in the United States that had investors very excited. I'm saying this very tongue and cheek. Obviously, those are not strong numbers but the commentary that management provided around the demand structure for Enphase which does create micro inverters for things like solar panels as well as batteries for stolge storage, the commentary was to say that the market is going to stabilize. So now a lot of this demand is driven by external factors, so we're talking about government incentives, conflict globally, as well as things like interest rates because a lot of people choose to finance their installation of solar projects. All of those things have these kind of external factors that have pushed down demand and sell through for the company over the course of the past year. But that management that things may be normalizing alongside that expectation, that maybe interest rates come down a bit over the course of the next year I think has the market a bit more excited after a year of pessimism."", ""Dylan Lewis: So maybe the outlook isn't quite as cloudy, is that the take?"", ""Emily Flippen: Yes, and a lot of their near term outlook is because their partners or distribution partners are working through existing inventory levels, so they're not shipping through new products. But that doesn't mean the actual sell through on the other end is as bad as it initially looks this quarter. So I do think that the expectation is for a little bit of normalization heading into 2024."", ""Dylan Lewis: Emily, this is a name that I'm not super familiar with, and so I was getting up to speed before we headed into taping. You mentioned a whole host of different macro factors there, is this one of those companies that investors just have to understand, there are some larger whims that are going to sweep up the adoption and sell through on the product?"", ""Emily Flippen: Yeah, the biggest thing to understand for somebody who's not familiar with this space is that solar is by far the cheapest form of electricity and energy is expensive especially for areas like Europe for instance, and only getting more expensive over time. So the long term tailwinds should be there for the demand and installation of solar projects, even if the near term is extremely lumpy, as you mentioned, due to these external circumstances, so don't write off this business just base out those headline numbers."", ""Dylan Lewis: Emily, Matt. We're going to see you guys a little bit later in the show up next, we've got tips for handling money issues, whether you're a tight wad or spendthrift stay right here, you're listening to Motley Fool Money."", ""Welcome back to Motley Fool Money. I'm Dylan Lewis. Valentine's Day is coming up and in fact, this is your PSA. If you don't have anything planned yet for the person in your life, you still have time. Go get after it to help our listeners in all matters, gift giving and money and relationships. My colleague, Deidre Woollard, caught up with Scott Rick, a marketing professor at the University of Michigan, and the author of Tightwads and Spendthrifts, navigating the money minefield in real relationships, they dug into the two major camps of savers and spenders, how payment salience is making things a bit tougher for everyone, and Rex for great gifts."", ""Deidre Woollard: Well, this book was really fascinating to me. I think I learned a little bit about myself and in the process, but let's start with the basics. What is a tightwad and how does it compare to someone who maybe is just a little frugal?"", ""Scott Rick: They will look quite similar on paper of a tightwad and a highly frugal person. But a tightwad is someone who often has money to spend and they know there are things that would make them and the people around them happier. But the prospect of spending the money makes them very anxious and they just can't make it happen. The thought of spending the money keeps them from buying a lot of the stuff that they realize would be in their best interest. This can be very frustrating for them, and the people around them can lead to a lot of internal conflict. Again, it can look good on paper, but it's not always a pleasant internal situation. Whereas a highly frugal person that's quite different. Frugal people, they save a lot, they're happy. They believe in saving. They love reusing items until they're just completely worn out. They're not overburdened with a lot of desire for new material objects. They're just living very conservatively and loving it. Frugal people tend to be quite happy whereas tightwads, that's a little trickier."", ""Deidre Woollard: It sounds like there's some anxiety about the spending that, that sort of defines what a tightwad is."", 'Scott Rick: Yes. Anxiety, distress. Those are the key feelings that keep them from spending what they think they should.', ""Deidre Woollard: Now on the other side, the flip side, this spendthrift people think of this as maybe compulsive shopping, but this is not just someone who doesn't just spend, but it sounds like they almost don't think about money at all. Is it the opposite of the anxiousness about money?"", ""Scott Rick: Well, I think they realize they're not kind of doing what they should be doing. If you ask them like, oh, here's like a fun new product, when do you think you'll get tired of this? They're actually better at knowing when they're going to get tired of something than a tightwad is. They just care less about those future outcomes. They're very present oriented, living in the moment, they're aware of implications and negative implications of their shopping today. They're just not so constrained by those thoughts, that awareness of what happens later. They're living in the moment where a tightwad will sometimes they don't shop for things that they know they need. Spendthrifts will shop for not only what they need, but also what they might need some day, I'm at the store, I'm buying clothes for work. There's a fun velvet jacket that might be fun for a fancy party. I'm not invited to such a party, but what if I am some day? I'd rather be looking at it than looking for it, is the spendthrift ideology."", ""Deidre Woollard: In terms of how that works with like a compulsive shopping or hoarding, it sounds like it's slightly different because they don't need to amass as much stuff, they just don't think about it as much."", ""Scott Rick: Things like compulsive shopping. There's research showing that is often related to depression and can be treated with anti-depressants and therapy. There is a more therapeutic approach to tamping down compulsive shopping. I think hoarding is in that ballpark. Whereas I don't think something like an anti-depressant would have much of an effect on spendthrift. That doesn't seem to be what's driving them to spend so much. It's just someone cut the brakes on the car, they just don't have the stop signal so good."", 'Deidre Woollard: It sounds like the spendthrift is happier than the tightwad overall.', ""Scott Rick: Well, they're both conflicted. That's what they have in common that they're both torn. There are people in the middle of this distribution, we call them unconflicted consumers, and they are in the Goldilock zone, and not too little, not too much, and they're happy with what they spend. But it's the two extremes, the tightwads and Spendthrifts. There's a lot of regret there. They're kicking themselves, but for very different reasons."", ""Deidre Woollard: We've got a quiz in the book. I don't want to go through the whole thing, but if you're trying to assess where you might fall on that spectrum, what are some quick questions you can ask yourself?"", ""Scott Rick: Well, imagine you go to the mall and are you kicking yourself afterwards for either not buying something that you thought you should, that's a tightwad thought or are you like, well, I probably shouldn't have bought, that's the spendthrift. The scale has questions like that. Who do you relate to more? What perspective? I see this in my own life. I'm a spendthrift. I'm married to a tightwad, and my wife used to come home from shopping, what she called shopping. But she would tell me about the things she wished she bought and I was like, why didn't you buy the thing? My goodness you could use that. Those regrets is what the scale tries to tap into."", ""Deidre Woollard: Well, on either side you've got these ways that you can mitigate your own tendencies. One of the things you talk about in the book is the way that spending has shifted and just the way that it's frictionless. You talk about this thing that I thought was really interesting called payment salience, which is just this awareness of the fact that you're spending, even when you're just swiping a card or tapping something on your phone. How can you reduce or increase this to mitigate your natural tendencies?"", ""Scott Rick: Certainly retailers are doing everything they can to reduce payment salience and the emphasis, and they're artists like Amazon, it's amazing. If you're a tightwad, it's just putting yourself in those places where you can distract yourself and not pay too much attention to the money leaving your possession. The real challenges for the spendthrifts, they're on their own to ramp up payment salience, but it's doable. It's possible. When I was in grad school and I had no money, I had to turn myself into a temporary tightwad. I would pay with cash whenever possible, I would make sure I felt pain at the ATM reducing my account balance and then pain at the store when paying with cash. Just trying to put up these speed bumps, all this friction like paying attention to the money I was spending. When I would spend with a card, I would get the receipt, take it home, and go into my Excel file and keep track of each purchase. That was painful to look at all this money being spent. I was just trying to ramp up how obvious it was, the money leaving my possession and so that's the challenge for spendthrift. You're on your own, retailers are not looking to help you."", ""Deidre Woollard: [laughs] Definitely not. I think it's interesting that we all have these tendencies and then we have to work against our own nature to get us more to the middle ground."", 'Scott Rick: Yes, exactly. But we can learn from people trying to influence us. I think there are things we can do to influence ourselves, to reshape how we think about choices and what reminders or speed bumps we put in our own environment so we can become like self marketers, so to speak.', ""Deidre Woollard: Well, you mentioned that you're the spendthrift, you're married to the tightwad, I think I might be the tightwad, married to the spendthrift. You've done some research on whether or not these different types are likely to marry. What did you discover? How does some of this play out?"", ""Scott Rick: Normally, we marry ourselves. We like most things about ourselves and we look for that in other people. But if there is something we don't like about ourselves, we're not necessarily looking for that in someone else. It can really shine a uncomfortable spotlight on the issue. If I see someone who approaches money the same way I do, and I don't like how I approach money, it's like, is that what I look like? Is that what I act like? It can really be a real turn off at first, we find that indeed tightwads and spendthrifts are more likely to marry each other than they are to marry someone like themselves. We think that's fun at first, but there are lots of things that are fun at first, that are less fun in a marriage when the decisions are more important. When there are higher stakes. It is one of these so called fatal attractions. If I'm a shy person, I might find someone really outgoing, fun and exciting at first. But eventually I do need my quiet time and it might get old over time. This seems to be one of those patterns."", 'Deidre Woollard: What happens if the two alike types marry each other? If a tightwad and a tightwad get together, is it just a big grim and if a spendthrift and spendthrift get together, do they just bankrupt themselves?', ""Scott Rick: Well, I would say that the two spendthrift pairing is the most dangerous and it can be financially explosive. But certainly if they have the money to spend, that could be quite a fun life, but that is a very precarious pairing. Now to tightwads, if you're just looking to maximize the money in the home, you want to put as many tightwads in the home as possible, for sure. They are usually living a pretty stable comfortable life. It's not necessarily an exciting one or filled with much adventure, or novelty, or fresh experience. They can work at that but left to their own devices, it can be, not for everyone, let's say, a little quiet. I do think a mismatched couple has the most potential for happiness, because I think this balance can work but it takes some efforts."", ""Deidre Woollard: Sounds like it may also take some self awareness too. If you don't know which side you're on, then the other person's spending attitude can just seem wrong and stupid."", 'Scott Rick: Oh yes. It\'s good to do things like take this scale, the tightwad-spendthrift scale, or there are other questionnaires, things to reflect on what you\'re up to, and try to think about what your partner, how they might respond, see if you can guess their responses. But yeah, it\'s good to know where everyone\'s coming from. Like I might get a gift from my spouse that seems really cheap and like, ""Oh my God, you don\'t love me, do you?"" But I need to keep in mind like, ""Oh, you really find it painful to spend money."" It\'s not your feelings about me, it\'s just your nature, it\'s in you. It helps me interpret how you spend and what you think about me. It\'s good to keep in mind where everyone\'s coming from.', ""Deidre Woollard: We're recording this near Valentine's Day and this is one of those gifting land mines. This is worse than Christmas, in my opinion. You talked earlier about tightwads and spendthrifts and understanding each other's gifting language. How do we get through this holiday and give appropriate gifts without causing ourselves a little bit of pain?"", ""Scott Rick: Well, first of all, I suggest don't ask the other person what they want."", 'Deidre Woollard: Oh, yeah. Never works well.', 'Scott Rick: Well, yeah and it can hurt their feelings. You can ask in like the night before, like, ""You want something, are we doing Valentine\'s this year?"" No, we don\'t. But really, the gift giving is a chance to show the person, ""Oh, I see you, I know you, I understand you"". Giving a good gift, it takes time. You got to be curious about your partner and, and take time to learn about them and ask them what are they excited about? What are they worried about? What are their hopes and dreams? That kind of thing, so there\'s that. Also, I would say that a good gift requires sacrifice. I need to know that this wasn\'t super easy for you to find or think of or obtain. I want to get the sense that you didn\'t just pick this up at CVS on your way home. If a spendthrift wants to sacrifice, it\'s not going to be through spending money because if I\'m married to a spendthrift, I know they find spending money, it\'s no big deal. Oh, they get me an iPad. It\'s nice, but they just got themselves the new iPhone. They do this kind of stuff all the time, it\'s water off their back. They have to do something that takes time and effort. They got to plan a weekend. They got to track down a rare Taylor Swift album autograph or something that is hard to find. They got to put in the efforts. A tightwad, it\'s a little different. If I know a tightwad doesn\'t like spending money and they spend a bunch of money, that\'s a sacrifice. They\'ve endured something painful. Now, it still has to be a thoughtful gift, but for them, spending money can be a real act of self sacrifice. Yeah, I would just say keep in mind the gift will be interpreted based on what the recipient knows about you and how you approach money, so you have to sacrifice accordingly.', ""Dylan Lewis: Listeners, you can catch Scott Rick's thoughts on money and relationships on X. He is @ScottIanRick. A special shout out to the person in my life who makes me a little bit less of a tightwad, Jess. Listeners, we hope everyone out there has someone that loves them and makes them revisit their own money habits. Coming up after the break, Matt Argersinger and Emily Flippen return with a couple of stocks on their radar. Stay right here. You're listening to Motley Fool Money [MUSIC] As always, people in the program may have interests in the stocks they talk about and the Motley Fool may have formal recommendations for or against. Snow buyers, anything based solely on what you hear. I'm Dylan Lewis joined again by Emily Flippen and Matt Argersinger. Matt, Emily, we're going to talk radar stocks in a second. But this week's interview ahead of Valentine's Day was all about savers and spenders and the relationships with money within relationships. I'm going to force you both to put yourself into one bucket, tightwad or spendthrift, Emily, which one is it?"", ""Emily Flippen: This is so hard because I think the world is created of grays. But I guess if I have to choose, I would maybe put myself in the tightwad bucket and that bucket. But that's not because I don't like to spend, I think in my relationship, I'm actually the bigger spender of us. But it is because I keep a spreadsheet of all of our finances. I know where every penny is constantly and if that's not the definition of an anxious attachment to money, I don't know what is."", 'Dylan Lewis: Matt, what about you?', ""Matt Argersinger: I also have spreadsheets, but I am very much a spendthrift, especially these days, since I've had a son. I realized that experiences are very important. We just got back from a really expensive ski trip, but we loved every second of it. Really, when it comes to experiences, life events, things like that, I'm doling out the money as fast as I can. Tightwad in other places but not when it comes to that."", ""Dylan Lewis: Let's get over to stocks on our radar. Our man behind the glass is going to hit you with a question. Emily, you're up first. What are you looking at this week?"", ""Emily Flippen: Snapchat is on my radar this week. Now, look, when you talk about radar stocks, there's lots of reasons why a business could be on our radar. Sometimes we're buying it hand over fist, sometimes we're interested in a factor. At this case, Snapchat's on my radar because it's down more than 30% after their fourth quarter results. It's certainly worth talking about because that's a pretty massive reaction to what it's otherwise a pretty decent quarter from Snapchat. They had strong user growth, they had decent cost of management executed on a lot of the vision that management had communicated earlier this year. But I think the reason why we're seeing this massive reaction is just because the ad business for so many other companies has been so strong and to see that weakness coming out of Snapchat, and especially attributing a lot of that to global conflict while other businesses are just not saying the same thing, could highlight just a systematic weakness that exists in Snapchat's platform. Which I've always said, I think reduces their ability to monetize as effectively as other platforms. A little bit of the Twitter problem facing snap chat today, so it's on my radar for that reason alone."", 'Dylan Lewis: Dan, a question about a maybe bearish, maybe careful watch stock on Snap?', ""Dan Boyd: Emily, can somebody please take this company private so we don't have to hear about how crappy it's doing ever again?"", ""Emily Flippen: I don't know, that Snapchat+ subscription. There's something there."", ""Dylan Lewis: [laughs] It doesn't sound like Dan's going to be signing up for that one. But we'll see, maybe we can convince him. Matt, what's on your radar this week?"", ""Matt Argersinger: Well, I think Dan likes coffee. I think he does and so Starbucks is on my radar, ticker SBUX. Company is off to a bit of a slow start to its fiscal year. They hit the low end of their comps and revenue growth in that first quarter. But I think there are three things happening that are pretty compelling. One, really focused on efficiency these days and it's really paying off,290 basis point improvement in operating margin in the quarter, operating profits were up 25%. Second, this is still very much a global growth story. China is still a big market for them, they're just getting started in India. I think there's a viable path for them to double their international stores within a decade. Then third, Starbucks bought back almost $1.4 billion worth of stock in this quarter. That was more than they were purchased in all of fiscal 2023. Management thinks the stock is cheap, I think it's cheap as well. I don't think it stays below $100 for a share for too long. We just recommend the stock in our dividend investor service, I got to give that a shout out. Starbucks is one that I'm paying very close attention to."", 'Dylan Lewis: Dan, a question about Starbucks.', ""Dan Boyd: At risk of alienating all of the listeners I haven't already alienated yet, Matty, I actually prefer tea to coffee."", ""Dylan Lewis: Oh my gosh. That's a shock to the dozens of listeners."", ""Dan Boyd: Yeah. But what a different company than Snap. Starbucks, they seem to be doing really strong, it's something else. Host Emeritus, Chris Hill was always talking about how coffee isn't going anywhere and it looks like that's the truth for Starbucks."", ""Dylan Lewis: Yeah, I think you're right. I think the addiction thesis is a strong thesis, when it comes to people's daily habits and caffeine. That's going to do it for this week's Motley Fool Money radio show. The show is mixed by Dan Boyd. I'm Dylan Lewis. Thanks for listening.

As durable demand fuels the multiyear growth opportunity in senior housing, we believe Ventas offers an attractive combination of growth and value. Let me provide a few reasons we believe we are uniquely positioned to create value. We entered 2024 with momentum. Because our asset classes are benefiting from demographic demand that is strong and getting stronger, we are pleased to project another consecutive year of normalized FFO growth in the mid-single digits and the third consecutive year of same-store SHOP cash NOI growth in the double digits. Notably, our projected 2024 normalized FFO growth of 5% per share puts us in the top 20% of all REITs that have issued guidance to date.', ""In 2024, we expect to benefit from steady growth from our outpatient medical research and triple net lease portfolios. As we look into 2025, we have 2 large lease renewals, one with Brookdale in senior housing and another with Kindred for a portion of our LTACs. In Brookdale's case, our communities are enjoying positive operating trends, and they have significant net absorption potential. In Kindred's situation, rent coverage remains challenged, and it's too early to say what the ultimate outcome in 2025 will be. Kindred remains focused on performance improvements that could benefit 2024 and 2025 financial results. In all cases, we are fully prepared to maximize NOI over time. In SHOP, January is already starting positively, with 200 basis points in year-over-year same-store occupancy growth."", 'In 2024, we expect year-over-year normalized FFO and SHOP same-store cash NOI growth to accelerate in the second half, with a SHOP NOI exit run rate that should support continued SHOP growth in 2025 and beyond. This highly positive context is supportive of growing our senior housing presence through both organic and inorganic growth. In pursuit of delivering consistent superior performance, our strategy is to, one, continue to deliver compelling profitable organic growth in senior housing; two, capture value-creating external growth focused on senior housing; and three, drive strong execution and cash flow generation throughout our high-quality portfolio that serves a large and growing aging demographic. Our optimism for a long, durable growth opportunity in SHOP is founded on compelling supply/demand dynamics, led by a step function in growth of the over-80 population in 2024 and yet again in 2027, the lowest construction starts in senior housing since 2009 and our advantaged platform that has the team, tools, financial strength, data and operators to drive organic performance.', ""The Ventas platform should also enable us to invest successfully. As we discussed in November, we intend to build on our compelling organic growth opportunity by layering on value-creating external investments focused on senior housing. There is a confluence of market factors giving us confidence that 2024 and 2025 should be rich with investment opportunities. We're already seeing our pipeline expand as high-quality senior housing communities in good markets with embedded growth come to market, and we have a line of sight to complete over $300 million of investments in the first half of this year. Our criteria for investments include attractive going-in yields priced at below replacement costs with projected low to mid-teens unlevered IRRs that meet our right market, right asset, right operator framework."", ""Our broader objectives are to drive enterprise NOI and normalized FFO per share growth, increase the scale of our SHOP business, deliver strong returns on capital, support stable and growing dividend capacity and maximize value for shareholders. In sum, we delivered on our commitments in 2023, and we expect another year of normalized FFO per share and property performance growth in 2024. Our 5% projected normalized FFO growth favorably distinguishes Ventas across the REIT universe. With an attractive valuation and the growth engine of senior housing, we are focused on enabling exceptional environments for a large and growing aging population and creating value for our shareholders. Now I'm happy to turn the call over to Justin."", ""Justin Hutchens: Thank you, Debbie. I'm pleased to say our SHOP portfolio delivered double-digit same-store cash NOI growth for the sixth quarter in a row. The same-store NOI growth for the year was led by our U.S. communities with 24.5% growth complemented by our high-quality Canadian portfolio, which is over 95% occupied and continues to deliver a valuable and stable cash flow. Total SHOP same-store cash NOI growth was 18.3%, which was above same-store guidance midpoint expectations. We are happy with this attractive growth and strong finish to the year. Double clicking on the year, the results were good. Our same-store SHOP communities outperformed our expectations across all key metrics, including occupancy, REVPOR, OpEx and margin expansion."", 'Full year same-store SHOP occupancy grew by 120 basis points. The U.S. saw 140 basis points of occupancy gains, and Canada, although already highly occupied, grew by 90 basis points. Demand strength across geographies and asset types led to accelerating occupancy growth this quarter, with 170 basis points of year-over-year growth. Furthermore, we saw 110 basis points of average sequential occupancy growth from the third quarter to the fourth. U.S. SHOP occupancy growth was supported primarily by strong demand, with move-ins that were 109% of prior year levels in the fourth quarter. REVPOR grew over 6% for the year. contributing to revenue growth of almost 8%. As a reminder, REVPOR would have been 40 basis points higher in 2023 and 130 basis points on the fourth quarter if adjusted for the Sunrise special assessment that occurred in 2022.', 'OpExPOR performed well and was led by the U.S. with 2% growth year-over-year and 2.6% overall. Looking forward to 2024, we are excited to continue on our multiyear growth trajectory as we are expecting our third consecutive year of double-digit NOI growth in our same-store SHOP portfolio. Momentum ramped at the end of 2023, with fourth quarter occupancy accelerating, while strong pricing and higher move-ins fuel better than typical seasonal results and help 2024 to get off to a strong start. Once again, we are expecting the U.S. to be the growth engine with continued accelerating occupancy performance, with over 300 basis points growth, and expected to drive NOI growth in the mid- to high teens year-over-year. The overall SHOP portfolio is expected to grow NOI 10%, 15%.', 'The growing demand at our doorstep continues to support strong price and volume growth and serves a testament to the high quality and care and services and value proposition our communities provide to seniors and their families. The key assumptions that drive the midpoint of our range are average occupancy growth of about 250 basis points, REVPOR growth of about 5%, which puts the total revenue growth around 8%. January occupancy is already off to a strong start, delivering 200 basis points of occupancy growth year-over-year. This performance demonstrates solid execution by our operators and continued demand. We expect the performance throughout the year to be bolstered by newly renovated properties and Ventas OI initiatives to drive a strong key selling season.', ""2024 OpExPOR is expected to grow in line with normal inflation. We structured our business around rate growth and occupancy growth. We are entering the sweet spot where price and occupancy are moving together to drive revenue. Margin expansion will follow as higher occupancy creates operating leverage. We have struck a balance where they are moving together, and we anticipate further margin expansion over time as higher occupancy creates operating leverage. We are capitalizing our active asset management playbook and our operators' execution, which delivered strong momentum to finish 2023 and will propel us into 2024. We expect this to build sequentially throughout the year, which means we are poised for strong year-end NOI that should propel us even further in 2025 and beyond."", ""We are delivering on the organic senior housing growth, which is the part 1 of our strategy and my #1 priority. Part 2 is expanding our footprint. In addition to the success we are having in our existing portfolio, we look forward to capturing value-creating external growth focused on senior housing. A key tenet of our investment strategy is our right market, right asset, right operator approach. We're bringing OI tools to investment activities to help the selection process. Our top investment priorities continue to be NOI-generating CapEx in our existing real estate and senior housing acquisitions. Sellers are motivated to transact, creating numerous actionable deals. We are targeting opportunities with low to mid-teen unlevered IRRs. We seek senior housing communities that are located in submarkets with compelling supply-demand profile, strong affordability and meaningful expected net absorption projections."", 'We are primarily expanding with existing partners with proven performance for Ventas, and plan to increase our footprint in the fast-growing IL, AL memory care combination communities. Our pipeline is growing, as we have several interesting potential investments in our sites. Our team is actively working on transactions exceeding 300 million that meet our criteria, and I look forward to adding to that as the year progresses. In summary, demand is at our doorstep. We are pleased to see the SHOP growth engine continue to be led by the U.S. and complemented by the low beta, high quality and highly valuable Canada portfolio with compounding growth. 2024 is rich with opportunities through organic growth and external acquisitions. The growth on both fronts throughout the year should support value creation in 2025 and beyond.', ""I'm looking forward to the exciting year ahead. Bob?"", ""Robert Probst: Thank you, Justin. I'm going to share some highlights on our '23 performance, touch on our balance sheet and close with our 2024 outlook. I'll start by saying we are pleased with all we accomplished in 2023. We finished the year strong, with reported normalized FFO per share of $0.76 in the fourth quarter, a 7% increase versus the prior year, adjusting for the promote received in Q4 of '22. For the fiscal year '23, we delivered normalized FFO of $2.99 per share or over 5% growth year-over-year when adjusting the prior year for unusual items. The multiyear senior housing growth trajectory was in full display in '23, with SHOP total NOI increasing year-over-year by approximately $100 million. We also reported total company same-store cash NOI growth of over 8% year-over-year, which is one of the fastest organic growth rates in our company's history."", ""Our 2023 normalized FFO of $2.99 per share was at the high end of our previous $2.96 to $2.99 guidance range, and included $0.01 per share cybersecurity revenue impact in the fourth quarter in our Ardent OpCo investment that was not contemplated in prior guidance. Pete Bulgarelli and our outpatient medical and research team delivered another year of continuous compounding growth, with same-store cash NOI increasing nearly 3% in 2023, at the high end of our guidance range. Continued strong retention and leasing activity in outpatient medical led the way. A key driver of that result is the remarkable record of tenant satisfaction in Ventas' Lillibridge property management business, which notched its fourth consecutive year of top quartile tenant satisfaction."", ""In 2023, Lillibridge reached the 97th percentile for overall tenant satisfaction, placing it among the top 5 property managers. I'd also like to share a few comments on our balance sheet. Throughout 2023, we used our scale and access to diverse sources of capital, raised over $4 million of attractively-priced capital across multiple markets and geographies. This capital raising in 2023 in part refunded 2024 maturing debt at attractive rates. As a result, we had a robust year-end 2023 liquidity position of $3.2 billion and have relatively modest 2024 maturing debt of $800 million net of cash on hand. The attractive NOI and EBITDA growth in our SHOP business also improved Ventas' net debt-to-EBITDA ratio to 6.9x in the fourth quarter, a trend we expect to continue in 2024 and beyond led by the multiyear SHOP NOI growth opportunity."", ""Let's conclude with our full year 2024 outlook. Because our asset classes are benefiting from powerful demographic demand, we are pleased to project another consecutive year of normalized FFO growth in the mid-single digits, and the third consecutive year of same-store SHOP cash NOI growth in the double digits. For 2024, we expect net income attributable to common stockholders of $0.06 per share at the midpoint. Our 2024 normalized FFO guidance range is $3.07 to $3.18 or $3.13 per share at the midpoint, which represents 5% year-over-year growth. The $0.14 FFO per share increase year-over-year can be bridged by 3 items. We expect a $0.28 per share contribution from outstanding year-over-year property growth led again by SHOP, which is expected to grow NOI by over $100 million for the second consecutive year."", ""This property growth is partially offset by an $0.11 per share increase in higher interest expense and the $0.03 impact of 2023 capital recycling. In terms of same-store, we expect our total company same-store cash NOI to grow between 5% and 7.5% in 2024 led by SHOP same-store cash NOI growth of 10% to 15%. Our guidance also includes new senior housing investments of 350 million, which Justin mentioned in his remarks. The low and high end of our FFO guidance range are largely described by our property NOI expectations and potential changes in interest rates. A final note on phasing. We expect same-store cash NOI and normalized FFO year-over-year growth to ramp through the year, driven by higher interest expense in the first half of '24 versus '23, and the occupancy acceleration in the key selling season in SHOP, resulting in an exit run rate that should enable attractive SHOP growth '25 and beyond."", ""A more fulsome discussion of our '24 guidance assumptions can be found in the earnings and outlook presentation posted to our website. To close, the entire Ventas team is ready to win together with all of our stakeholders. And that concludes our prepared remarks. [Operator Instructions]. With that, I'll turn the call back to the operator."", 'See also Top 20 Motorcycle Brands in the World and 15 Best Hospitals for Cancer Treatment in the US.', 'To continue reading the Q&A session, please click here.']"

Read on.', ""Disney's streaming rival Netflix (NASDAQ: NFLX) has seen subscriber growth soar over the past year in part due to its crackdown on password sharing, which it calls paid sharing."", 'Now, Disney is preparing to implement its own paid-sharing program on Disney+ and Hulu.

It gives free riders the option of getting their own account, being added to the main account, or losing access to the service.

It's clear why it has been challenging -- there are several moving parts in that process. Disney owns ABC, ESPN, and several other cable networks, and the company traditionally brought in billions in box office receipts each year."", 'The weakness in the business and the stock has come from the decline in profits from its linear media business while it loses money on streaming. But that could soon change. If Disney can deliver streaming profitability on time and demonstrate a path to growing those profits, the stock is likely to soar.', 'Its experiences division, based around its theme parks, just produced record revenue, profits, and operating margin.

""Until very recently margins were fairly high and owners might have begun to fantasize that they could get a very good price,"" said Garfield Miller, president of downstream-focused investment bank Aegis Energy Advisors. Those fantasies, however, have not turned into reality. Key industry metrics show plant valuations are down a third since the global financial crisis of 2008 and have not recovered, according to MorningStar analyst Allen Good. A U.S. refinery has not changed hands since independent refiner Par Pacific completed its $310 million acquisition of Exxon Mobil\'s 63,000 barrels per day (bpd) Billings, Montana, plant last year. That deal came after years-long efforts by the oil major to sell the facility and closed at the lower end of the $300 million to $600 million range industry insiders were expecting. Delta Air Lines has made multiple failed attempts to offload the nearly 100-year old, 190,000-bpd Trainer, Pennsylvania, refinery since 2018 and is still trying, sources close to the refinery said, requesting anonymity as the discussions are private. Phillips 66, the third largest independent U.S. refiner, is pursuing a $3 billion divestiture program that will likely include some of its smaller refineries, industry sources said. Venezuelan-owned Citgo has three refineries in Texas, Louisiana and Illinois with combined capacity of 805,000 bpd up for sale as part of a U.S. court auction in a historic case to settle Venezuelan debts. Top U.S. refiner Marathon, however, in an October conference call indicated no interest in those plants, while rival PBF Energy this week said it was not planning any deals in the near future. Phillips 66 and Delta said they do not comment on market rumors or speculation. ENERGY TRANSITION The U.S. is the world\'s top gasoline market and its refineries are mainly geared towards producing the motor fuel. Gasoline consumption, however, likely peaked in 2018 at over 9.3 million bpd and is expected to decline from next year onwards, according to government projections.', 'Refiners are expected to face new headwinds with the wider adoption of electric vehicles and policies intended to phase out fossil fuels. West Coast refineries, which typically serve Californian and Latin American drivers, operate in a market where zero-emission vehicle sales are growing the fastest and state governments are accelerating the energy transition by banning sales of new gasoline-only vehicles by 2035. Growing sales of electric vehicles in recent years have led forecasters to bring forward their projections for when global oil use will peak, as public subsidies and improved technology help lower prices for battery-powered cars. Transportation is responsible for about 60% of world oil demand, with the U.S. alone accounting for around 12%, according to the International Energy Agency. That share should fall, as the IEA expects EVs to erase some 5 million bpd of world oil demand by 2030. COSTLY MAINTENANCE The rising cost of maintenance and workloads to keep aging plants online have also deterred potential refinery buyers, particularly as companies focus on shareholder returns.', ""Valero , Marathon and Phillips 66 together had the equivalent of 280,000 bpd of capacity offline in 2023 due to planned and unplanned outages, a more than 20% increase from 2019, according to IIR Research. For some operators, the bill to repair these facilities can be enormous. Phillips 66 spent $786 million on maintenance in 2023, according to company filings. LyondellBasell's 260,000-bpd Houston refinery, which is scheduled to close next year after two failed attempts to sell, would have required about $1 billion in upgrades to continue operations, according to analyst and corporate estimates."", 'Shell has already closed its 240,000-bpd Convent, Louisiana, refinery, after failing to find a buyer during the pandemic. Seven other North American refineries have shuttered since capacity peaked at 19 million bpd in 2020, removing about 1 million bpd of capacity.', '""Refiners are learning if they don\'t invest in their facilities before they put their plants up for sale, interest will dwindle,"" Aegis\' Miller said.', '(Reporting by Laura Sanicola and Shariq Khan; Editing by Liz Hampton and Marguerita Choy)']"

Although it hasn't outperformed the S&P 500 by a huge margin, it has delivered superior gains to its investors."", 'Over the past decade, Amgen has become a bigger, more diversified business. In 2014, its product sales topped $19.3 billion. This past year, they totaled $26.9 billion, growing by 39% over the past 10 years. In 2014, the company had seven key blockbuster drugs that made up its top line. Today it has nine, and that number is likely to rise in the future.', ""Amgen hasn't been shy in spending money on acquisitions that it feels can grow its business. In October, it closed its $27.8 billion deal to acquire Horizon Therapeutics. Through that acquisition, Amgen gained a promising treatment for thyroid eye disease, Tepezza, along with Krystexxa, which is a drug used to treat gout. But it's Tepezza that's the prize, because it may generate peak annual sales of $3.9 billion."", 'In 2022, Amgen acquired ChemoCentryx for $3.7 billion.

It generated $7.4 billion in free cash flow last year while revenue of $28.2 billion rose by 7%. Although it's not a terribly rapidly expanding company, Amgen does have the resources at its disposal (i.e., cash) to allow it to continue pursuing growth opportunities in the future."", ""And with a payout ratio of 68%, the dividend looks safe as well.

The company has also increased its payout for 12 straight years."", ""There's a lot to like about Amgen.

NEER, the renewable energy segment, stands as the world's largest generator of renewable energy from the wind and sun, further solidifying NEE's market leadership. This SWOT analysis delves into the strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats as presented in the latest SEC filing, offering investors a comprehensive view of the company's strategic outlook."", ""Renewable Energy Leadership: NextEra Energy Inc (NYSE:NEE) has established itself as a global leader in renewable energy, with NEER being the world's largest generator of renewable energy from the wind and sun. This leadership is underpinned by a significant generation capacity of over 25 GW, including a diverse mix of natural gas, nuclear, wind, and solar. The company's strategic focus on clean energy solutions, coupled with its extensive portfolio, positions it well to capitalize on the growing demand for sustainable energy sources."", ""Operational Excellence and Customer Focus: NEE's regulated utility, FPL, serves nearly 6 million customer accounts in Florida, making it the largest rate-regulated utility in the state. FPL's strategic investments in generation, transmission, and distribution facilities have resulted in low customer bills, high reliability, outstanding customer service, and clean energy solutions. This customer-centric approach has contributed to FPL's strong financial performance, accounting for roughly 70% of NEE's consolidated operating earnings."", ""Regulatory and Compliance Risks: As a highly regulated entity, NEE faces significant regulatory and compliance risks that could impact its operations and financial performance.

Any adverse regulatory developments or failure to comply with regulations could result in financial penalties, increased costs, or restrictions on operations."", ""Capital Intensity and Debt Levels: NEE's business model is capital-intensive, requiring substantial investments in infrastructure and technology to maintain and expand its generation capacity.

Additionally, price volatility in the energy market can impact the profitability of NEE's non-contracted generation assets and commodity trading activities."", ""Environmental Regulations and Climate Change: NEE's operations are subject to environmental regulations, which are becoming increasingly stringent in response to climate change concerns. Compliance with these regulations can result in additional costs and operational constraints. Moreover, the physical impacts of climate change, such as severe weather events, could disrupt NEE's operations and infrastructure, leading to potential financial losses and reputational damage."", ""In conclusion, NextEra Energy Inc (NYSE:NEE) exhibits a strong position in the renewable energy sector, with its leadership in wind and solar generation and a customer-focused regulated utility. However, the company must navigate regulatory risks, manage its capital-intensive nature, and contend with market competition and environmental challenges. With strategic investments and favorable policy incentives, NEE has significant opportunities to expand its clean energy footprint and drive future growth.

If you want to skip our introduction to the global aircraft industry and the latest trends, then you can take a look at the Top 5 Aircraft Manufacturers In The World. ', 'The aircraft industry, just like consumer technology, has been making a lot of news over the past couple of months. This is because, at least when the Western world is concerned, there are only two primary aircraft manufacturing companies whose jets are capable of supporting large scale commercial operations. These are the U.S. aerospace giant The Boeing Company. (NYSE:BA) and its European counterpart Airbus SE (EPA:AIR.PA). Together, the duo dominates the industry for commercial aviation that is led globally by players the likes of Delta Air Lines, Inc. (NYSE:DAL) and United Airlines Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:UAL).', ""What this means is that aircraft manufacturing has to be precisely managed and carefully monitored to ensure that the stringent requirements of a large tube of aluminum traveling at more than half the speed of sound at thousands of feet in the air are met. On this front, the global aviation industry was shocked when a Boeing 737 Max aircraft's door blew out while it was cruising at altitude. Well, what blew out wasn't technically a door. Instead, it was a door plug that budget airlines use to make room for extra seats, and subsequent investigations revealed that a refurbishment oversight had led to the plug missing crucial bolts that would have held it in place."", ""For Boeing stock, the news naturally wasn't greeted well by investors who had already stood by the firm during its recent lowest after crashes that claimed the lives of hundreds of people. The stock is down 18.8% year to date, even while its European rival's shares have appreciated by more than 5% this year so far. The nature of the aviation industry means that since Boeing supplies a substantially larger number of aircraft to airlines than it would have had there been multiple other manufacturers when its production lines stopped due to industry scares or inspection requirements, the impact is significant."", ""In the aftermath of the 737 Max incident, the company shared the impact of the pressurization it faced from regulators and customers in February. Boeing outlined that its aircraft deliveries had shrunk by a third in January, and led the firm to deliver 27 airplanes in January. Had the 737 Max incident not occurred, then Boeing's deliveries might have sat at 38 planes - a fact that underscores the potential impact on a quarterly income statement from a handful of bolts and a lack of oversight. This is particularly painful for Boeing, an established stock that does not pay dividends since it stopped them in the aftermath of the coronavirus pandemic."", ""Yet, the firm's size means that it nevertheless did manage to keep up with Airbus when it came to delivering jets. Airbus's January deliveries stood at 30 planes, and for Boeing, despite the fact that deliveries and orders predictably slowed down, it did manage to make inroads into China in 2024. The firm shared in February 2024 that it has delivered three 737 Max's to China, which had suspended Boeing's imports in 2019."", ""Of course, while commercial aviation dominates the global aviation industry when it comes to size, it is only one portion of the pie. Boeing also makes aircraft for the U.S. military, and along with planes made by Lockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE:LMT), these are capable of both stretching the limits of physics and ferrying service members globally. However, on this front, its Lockheed and Northrop Grumman Corporation (NYSE:NOC) are more prominent. While Boeing's B-52 Stratofortress, an aircraft named after the literal Stratosphere, is nothing short of a modern engineering marvel capable of delivering fear equally just as well as it can deliver armaments, it's Lockheed and General Dynamics's F-16 Fighting Falcon that is the backbone of the global defense aviation industry."", ""But Boeing, Lockheed, Airbus, and Northrop are not the only major aircraft companies. The final segment of this multi billion dollar industry, expected to be worth $626 billion by the end of this decade, is the one that's the most glamorous. This is the private jet industry, and it is dominated by players such as the formidable Brazilian firm Embraer and the well known Gulfstream Corporation. For a detailed look at this particular sub segment of the global aviation industry, you can check out 15 Biggest Private Jet Companies in the World."", 'So, which companies are at the top when it comes to global aircraft manufacturing?

Shares slid 15% the day Novo Nordisk concluded trials showing the drug slowed the progression of chronic kidney disease, potentially impairing the company’s Renal Care business, its largest division. This was only the latest of Baxter’s problems. After levering up to buy Hillrom in 2021, every one of the company’s business segments – we counted ten before the recent restructuring – hit a wall, as increasing costs drove operating margins below 14% in recent quarters from highs north of 18% just a few years ago. Simply put, the company’s long-term, fixed contracts with large healthcare purchasing organizations were not designed to offset the levels of inflation brought on by pandemic-era supply chain struggles. As revenues slowed alongside hospital procedures, rising costs crushed operating profits. The multiple on the stock collapsed from the mid-20s towards the single digits, shaving three-quarters off the stock price and taking the market capitalization down to a low of $16 billion after shelling out nearly $12 billion for Hillrom just a few years ago. With shares trading at a trough multiple on depressed earnings, we see much room for upside surprises, and management is taking action to capitalize on the current dislocation. We expect leverage to fall back below 3x by FY25 after the company uses proceeds from the sale of its BioPharma business to pay down nearly $4 billion in debt. At the same time, the spin-off of BAX\'s Renal Care segment and recently revamped reporting structure should dramatically simplify the story.

It is scheduled this year to receive two cargo jets converted from passenger configuration, but delivery of a third plane has been delayed until 2025 because of lingering supply chain and labor challenges faced by aerospace manufacturing companies, said Galardo on the company’s fourth-quarter earnings call.', 'The company nonetheless expects cargo capacity to increase 6% to 8% this year with the addition of the two freighters and more passenger aircraft that also carry cargo. The converted freighters are retired Air Canada passenger jets that are being retrofitted by aftermarket aerospace firms for carrying large containers in the main cabin area.', 'Cargo revenue fell 15% year over year in the fourth quarter to US$181 million on soft demand and lower yields, Air Canada reported. The three-month period represented an improvement from prior months as the downturn in freight transportation that gripped the air logistics industry for nearly 18 months began to ease. Full-year cargo revenue fell 27% to $253.7 million.', 'At the end of 2023, Canada’s flag carrier operated four more 767 freighters than at the end of 2022. Freighters were reintroduced at the company two years ago. Increased freighter operations to Central and South America and to Europe partially offset the year-over-year decline. Air Canada also enhanced its interline cooperation with Emirates SkyCargo, which allows customers to book interline cargo shipments through the Emirates SkyCargo flights, including between the Americas and Southeast Asia and India, through key European hubs.', '“We had a bit of a slower start in January, but as we look into February and beyond we’re starting to see volumes pick up and yields also pick up. And our 2024 assumption on cargo is more volume-driven than yield-driven. So we’re starting to see some positive indicators,” Galardo told analysts. “We’ve taken all the necessary measures to position ourselves to take advantage of the recovery. This includes strategically adjusting our freighter plan so that we can keep focusing on proven overall results for the long term and on maximizing cargo network value for our entire fleet.”', '', 'Air Canada in late September canceled an order with Boeing for two 777-200 production freighters because of the reversal in airfreight demand following the pandemic-fueled boom for air transport that lasted until early 2022. It then ordered 18 787-10 Dreamliners, including two that were swapped for the 777 freighters. Management, at the time, reiterated its commitment to operating freighters, saying that it needed to take a more measured approach to fleet expenditures and keep more cash available for other purposes.', 'Air Canada expects another leap in cargo business when the 787-10s begin entering the fleet in late 2025. But ongoing safety and manufacturing problems at Boeing could upset the delivery schedule. Production flaws have previously prevented customers from receiving Dreamliners on time.', '“As we eventually receive the larger 787-10s, taking advantage of global cargo flows through our hubs will become an important lever for further diversifying revenue streams,” said Galardo.', 'Air Canada performed well on cargo against its peers during the fourth quarter. Delta Air Lines and American Airlines saw cargo revenue slide 24% during the period, and Korean Air said its cargo sales fell nearly 29%. The percentage change in revenue at Air Canada was on par with the 14.8% decline at United Airlines. On a total dollar basis, Air Canada cargo revenue was less than that of the other carriers. The three major U.S. airlines are much larger than Air Canada but also do not have a dedicated cargo fleet. Delta was the closest to Air Canada at $188 million in revenue.', 'Overall, Air Canada generated $3.9 billion in revenue, up 11% from the prior year, during the final three months of 2023. But earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization of $386.4 million came in below expectations. On an adjusted basis, the company lost $32.6 million versus a loss of $162 million the year before. Higher wages, maintenance costs and flying volumes pushed expenses up 8%.

If you want to skip our introduction to the global aircraft industry and the latest trends, then you can take a look at the Top 5 Aircraft Manufacturers In The World. ', 'The aircraft industry, just like consumer technology, has been making a lot of news over the past couple of months. This is because, at least when the Western world is concerned, there are only two primary aircraft manufacturing companies whose jets are capable of supporting large scale commercial operations. These are the U.S. aerospace giant The Boeing Company. (NYSE:BA) and its European counterpart Airbus SE (EPA:AIR.PA). Together, the duo dominates the industry for commercial aviation that is led globally by players the likes of Delta Air Lines, Inc. (NYSE:DAL) and United Airlines Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:UAL).', ""What this means is that aircraft manufacturing has to be precisely managed and carefully monitored to ensure that the stringent requirements of a large tube of aluminum traveling at more than half the speed of sound at thousands of feet in the air are met. On this front, the global aviation industry was shocked when a Boeing 737 Max aircraft's door blew out while it was cruising at altitude. Well, what blew out wasn't technically a door. Instead, it was a door plug that budget airlines use to make room for extra seats, and subsequent investigations revealed that a refurbishment oversight had led to the plug missing crucial bolts that would have held it in place."", ""For Boeing stock, the news naturally wasn't greeted well by investors who had already stood by the firm during its recent lowest after crashes that claimed the lives of hundreds of people. The stock is down 18.8% year to date, even while its European rival's shares have appreciated by more than 5% this year so far. The nature of the aviation industry means that since Boeing supplies a substantially larger number of aircraft to airlines than it would have had there been multiple other manufacturers when its production lines stopped due to industry scares or inspection requirements, the impact is significant."", ""In the aftermath of the 737 Max incident, the company shared the impact of the pressurization it faced from regulators and customers in February. Boeing outlined that its aircraft deliveries had shrunk by a third in January, and led the firm to deliver 27 airplanes in January. Had the 737 Max incident not occurred, then Boeing's deliveries might have sat at 38 planes - a fact that underscores the potential impact on a quarterly income statement from a handful of bolts and a lack of oversight. This is particularly painful for Boeing, an established stock that does not pay dividends since it stopped them in the aftermath of the coronavirus pandemic."", ""Yet, the firm's size means that it nevertheless did manage to keep up with Airbus when it came to delivering jets. Airbus's January deliveries stood at 30 planes, and for Boeing, despite the fact that deliveries and orders predictably slowed down, it did manage to make inroads into China in 2024. The firm shared in February 2024 that it has delivered three 737 Max's to China, which had suspended Boeing's imports in 2019."", ""Of course, while commercial aviation dominates the global aviation industry when it comes to size, it is only one portion of the pie. Boeing also makes aircraft for the U.S. military, and along with planes made by Lockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE:LMT), these are capable of both stretching the limits of physics and ferrying service members globally. However, on this front, its Lockheed and Northrop Grumman Corporation (NYSE:NOC) are more prominent. While Boeing's B-52 Stratofortress, an aircraft named after the literal Stratosphere, is nothing short of a modern engineering marvel capable of delivering fear equally just as well as it can deliver armaments, it's Lockheed and General Dynamics's F-16 Fighting Falcon that is the backbone of the global defense aviation industry."", ""But Boeing, Lockheed, Airbus, and Northrop are not the only major aircraft companies. The final segment of this multi billion dollar industry, expected to be worth $626 billion by the end of this decade, is the one that's the most glamorous. This is the private jet industry, and it is dominated by players such as the formidable Brazilian firm Embraer and the well known Gulfstream Corporation. For a detailed look at this particular sub segment of the global aviation industry, you can check out 15 Biggest Private Jet Companies in the World."", 'So, which companies are at the top when it comes to global aircraft manufacturing? We took a look, and the notable aircraft stocks in this list are Lockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE:LMT), Airbus SE (EPA:AIR.PA), and Northrop Grumman Corporation (NYSE:NOC).', ""An aerial view of a cargo plane taking off from a commercial airport, reflecting the company's overnight air cargo services."", 'Our Methodology ', 'To make our list of the top aircraft manufacturing companies in the world, we first made a list of all publicly traded companies that make aircraft.

We will make the necessary changes to the design and operating effectiveness of these specific revenue recognition internal controls during 2024. I would now like to turn the call over to Steve Oswald for a review of the operating results. Steve?', ""Steve Oswald: Thank you, Suman, and thanks everyone for joining us today for our fourth quarter conference call. Today, and as usual, I'll give an update on the current situation at the company, after which, Suman will review our financial results in detail. Q4 was a very good quarter as we wrapped up 2023. Revenues exceeded $190 million for the second consecutive quarter to $192.2 million, driving a full year revenue of $757 million with the last high mark set in 2012. Strong growth in our single-aisle commercial aircraft business helped to drive the revenue. The continued recovery in commercial aerospace once again delivered in Q4 with Boeing single-aisle platform business in aggregate being up 46% year-over-year along with Airbus A220 program showing strong growth of 73% year-over-year."", ""Overall, commercial aerospace with Airbus and Boeing and others was up 18% from fourth quarter 2022 despite Boeing's and Spirit's continued challenges with MAX quality issues. We are now in our 10th quarter of year-over-year revenue growth of Commercial Aerospace, a continued excellent sign for DCO and the industry. While our Defense business was slightly down the quarter with sunsetting programs such as the F-18 having an impact, the company also experienced strong demand in the Apache program as well as increases for F-35 and the MIRV missile platforms. The Defense business was over $100 million in revenue once again at $103 million of revenue for the quarter. We remain optimistic about the growth ahead. As we go through a timing transition on certain programs, the ever-growing backlog of Defense tells the story with backlog up $70 million from last year and $33 million from Q3, 2023."", 'Defense backlog now stands at over $0.5 billion at $527.1 million. Another real bright spot in Q4 was gross margins of 21.7% for the Q4, up 120 basis points year-over-year from 20.5% as we began realizing benefits from our -- of the strategic pricing initiative, productivity improvements and some initial restructuring savings. We are now also in the final stages of operation at our Berryville, Arkansas and Monrovia, California performance centers are targeting a full shutdown by June 30. The final approval stage with RTX for the Tomahawk harnesses going to Mexico, the last product still being produced at Berryville is closed. We continue to give a full effort with BA, BCS and BA Defense on the MAX spoilers and Apache tail rotors respectively, working with them on approval and building buffer.', 'Due to the low level of production at both sites, we do have some headwinds, but this is temporary and will clear after the closures. For adjusted operating margin in Q4, the team delivered 8.3% compared to 8.1% in Q4 2022, a nice result while investing some of the gross margin improvement after a few lean years during COVID and the ramp up of commercial aerospace. The GAAP diluted EPS was $0.34 a share in Q4 2023 versus $0.65 a share for Q4 2022. And with the adjustments, diluted EPS was a solid $0.70 a share compared to diluted EPS of $0.85 in the prior year. Some key drivers for the lower GAAP diluted EPS include higher interest expense due to higher interest rates, higher inventory purchase accounting adjustments and higher SG&A expenses, as we invested in the business to position it for the future.', ""The total company backlog performance increased both sequentially and compared to the prior year. Total company backlog ended 2023 at almost $994 million, increasing over $30 million both sequentially and compared to the prior year. Defense backlog as mentioned earlier also increased $70 million compared to the prior year end at a record of $527 million. The strong defense backlog reaffirms Ducommun's defense business remains in good shape with more positive news to come. The commercial aerospace backlog however decreased slightly year-over-year primarily due to industry issues with single-aisle production rates, Specifically, the MAX issues mentioned earlier with BA and Spirit, but still ended Q4 2023 at a solid $429 million for offloading from defense primes, the work continues."", 'We are expecting roughly $90 million for the full year in 2024 as committed to, mainly in our circuit card business for RTX and new areas such as radar for the SPY6. As communicated, the long-term run rate of these defense programs already commercialized or in development for offloading will be over $125 million by 2025 once transition work is completed. In Q4, our team delivered another good quarter managing the supply chain, as evidenced by positive revenue growth along with significant gross margin expansion compared to a year ago. Another great example of productivity improvements and people is the revenue per employee number, which granted as a high-level number, but did increase significantly by 16% in 2023 versus 2022. That is a terrific job for everyone at the company.', ""2023 record revenues of $757 million was a solid 6.2% growth over 2022 and in line with the guidance of 6% to 6.5% we provided to you during the Q3 call. We're obviously happy with this record number last set in 2012 especially in light of the 737 MAX headwinds with BA and Spirit that created a more modest pace that it then expected in single aisle production rates in 2023. For revenue guidance in 2024, we believe that with the uncertainty surrounding DA, Spirit and the FAA at this point on the max, the best approach is to guide to mid single digits and look to further updates on future earnings calls. The commercial aerospace recovery will continue to expand along with growth and defense, which is backed by a record backlog. We continue as well to be active with acquisitions."", ""As in 2020 [indiscernible] acquisition last April and believe this is another catalyst to drive us possibly higher in the year ahead. Now, let me provide some additional color on our markets, products and programs. Beginning with our military and space sector, we experienced our second consecutive quarter of revenues over a 100 million at 102.8 million compared to 108.4 million in Q4 2022, while lower, we saw some bright spots including strong demand for the Apache tail rotor blades with over 380% year-over-year growth and increased demand for other military and space products. Other military rotary wing platforms, F35 and the mere missile as well. The fourth quarter military and space revenue represented 53% of Ducommun's revenue in the period down from 58% last year, and this trend will continue to reflect more balance with commercial aerospace, which we like."", ""We also entered the fourth quarter with backlog in excess of 500 million to 527 million, an increase of 70 million year-over-year and represents 53% of the commons total backlog. Within our commercial aerospace operations, fourth quarter revenue, saw double digit growth once again, increasing 18% year-over-year to 80 million driven mainly by build rate increases on large aircraft platforms, including the 737 Max and A220 platforms and twin aisle commercial aircraft platforms, commercial, rotary weighing aircraft platforms, and regional and business jets. As many of you're aware, the FAA announced in January, that will increase its oversight of Boeing as well as require Boeing to get approval for production rate increases or additional production lines for the 737 Max, until it is satisfied that Boeing's in full compliance with required quality control procedures."", ""This will likely cap the production of the 737 Max, but we need to see how things go in Q1 of 2024, and the FAA going forward plan. We do however expect a long-term trend to remain positive once the issues are fully addressed. The backlog within our commercial aerospace sector was 429 million at the end of the fourth quarter, and while it was 21 million lower year-over-year, it increased 7 million sequentially, a solid number given the temporary weakness in commercial aerospace. With that, I'll have Suman review our financial results in detail. Suman?"", ""Suman Mookerji : Thank you, Steve. As a reminder, please see the company's Q4 earnings release for a further description of information mentioned on today's call. As Steve discussed, our fourth quarter results reflect another period of good performance. We again saw a significant increase in our commercial aerospace revenues. We remain encouraged by the continued strength in domestic and global travel, which should support higher long-term demand for aircraft as we work through some of the industry issues impacting single aisle production rates. In addition, we are encouraged by the strong backlog growth in our military and space business that should help drive our revenues in that end user segment going forward. During the quarter, we also continue to make progress on our restructuring program, and I will provide some more color shortly."", ""With all this, we feel like we have entered 2024 with good momentum that will continue to drive our performance. Now turning to our fourth quarter, results revenue for the fourth quarter of 2023 was 192.2 million versus 188.3 million for the fourth quarter of 2022. The year over year increase reflects 12.1 million of growth across our commercial aerospace platforms, partially offset by 5.6 million of lower revenue within the military and space sector due to lower build rates on various missile platforms and military fixed wing aircraft platforms such as the F-18 partially offset by higher build rates on military rotor wing aircraft platforms such as the Apache New Common's. Total backlog at the end of the fourth quarter was 993.6 million. This includes a record backlog in our defense and end users defense end user segment, which grew by 33 million to a total 527 million."", 'The backlog in our commercial aerospace business increased slightly during the quarter from 440 423 million at the end of Q3 to 429 million at the end of Q4. As a reminder, we define backlog as potential revenue based on customer purchase orders and long-term agreements with some fixed prices and expected delivery dates of 24 months or less. We posted total gross profit of 41.7 million or 21.7% of revenue for the quarter versus 38.6 million or 20.5% of revenue in the prior year period. We continue to share adjusted gross margins as we have certain non-GAAP cost of sales items in the current and prior year period relating to inventory step up amortization on our recent acquisitions, restructuring charges, and the impact of the Guaymas fire on our operations on an adjusted basis.', 'Our gross margins were 23.2% in Q4 2023 versus 21 in Q4 2022. The improvement in gross margins was driven by favorable product mix, better pricing, and improved scale. In our commercial aerospace business, we continue to work through a difficult operating environment with supply chain and LA labor. However, through our proactive efforts, including strategic buys and our inventory investments, we have been able to avoid any significant impacts thus far on our business. In parallel, we continue to look for opportunities to unwind our working capital investments to improve our cash flow. During the fourth quarter of 2023, we were able to reduce our inventory by 16 million sequentially compared to Q3. We also reduced our contract assets net of contract liabilities by 15 million.', 'Ducommun reported operating income for the fourth quarter of 8.9 million, or 4.6% of revenue compared to 9.7 million or 5.1% of revenue. In the prior year period, adjusted operating income was 15.9 million or 8.3% of revenue this quarter compared to 15.2 million or 8.1% of revenue in the comparable period last year. The company reported net income for the fourth quarter of 2023 or 5.1 million or $0.34 per diluted share compared to net income of 8.1 million or $0.65 per diluted share a year ago. On an adjusted basis, the company reported net income of 10.4 million or $0.70 per diluted share compared to net income of 10.6 million or $0.85. In Q4 2022, the lower adjusted net income during the quarter despite a higher level of adjusted operating income was driven mainly by higher interest costs, partially offset by lower income tax expense.', ""This was primarily due to the impact of Fed's rate hike on short-term interest rates. I will discuss this along with our interest rate hedge, which took effect on January 1st, 2024, shortly. Now let me turn to our segment results. Our Structural Systems segment posted revenue of $85.6 million in the fourth quarter of 2023 versus $68.2 million last year. The year-over-year increase reflects $12.3 million of higher sales across our commercial aerospace applications mainly for single-aisle aircraft for the 737 MAX and A220 platforms and $5 million of higher revenue within the military and space markets, mainly from the ramp-up in sales in the Apache program and other military rotor wing aircraft platforms. Structural Systems operating income for the quarter was $6.6 million or 7.7% of revenue compared to $4.4 million or 6.4% of revenue last year."", ""Excluding restructuring charges and other adjustments in both years, the segment operating margin was 14.6% in Q4 2023 versus 10.8% in Q4 2022. Strong year-over-year improvement was driven by favorable product mix, better pricing and higher [Technical Difficulty] in the businesses as our commercial aerospace revenues have continued to grow. This has been another great quarter for our Structural Systems segment. Our Electronics Systems segment posted revenue of $106.7 million in the fourth quarter of 2023 versus $120 million in the prior year period. The decline was mainly due to lower revenues with the company's Military & Space customers, including the impact and timing of reductions in revenues, on sunsetting programs such as the F-18 not synchronized with growth in sales from the company's position on next gen platforms."", 'Electronic Systems operating income for the fourth quarter was $9.8 million or 9.2% of revenue versus $13 million or 10.8% of revenue in the prior year period. Excluding restructuring charges and other adjustments in both years, the segment operating margin was 10.2% in Q4 2023 versus 12.9% in Q4 2022. The year-over-year decrease was due to unfavorable product mix and as Steve mentioned earlier, due to the loss of manufacturing volume and inefficiencies at our variable performance center as we wind down their operations. To clarify, such inefficiencies have not been considered as restructuring charges in our calculation of adjusted operating income or adjusted EBITDA. Next on the restructuring. As a reminder and as discussed previously, we commenced a restructuring initiative back in 2022, these actions are being taken to accelerate the achievement of our strategic goals and to better position the company for stronger performance in the short and long-term.', 'This includes the shutdown of our facilities in Monrovia, California and [indiscernible] Arkansas and transfer of majority of that work to our low cost operation in Guaymas, Mexico with the remainder going to other existing performance centers in the United States. We continue to make progress on these transitions with excellent employee retention and engagement and are also working diligently with our customers, Boeing and RTX to obtain the requisite approvals. During Q4 2023, we recorded $1.9 million in restructuring charges. The majority of these charges were severance and benefits related, as we continue to wind down the two operations. The recertification process is ongoing and we plan to close both facilities fully in the first half of 2024.', 'We expect to incur 5 million to 7 million in restructuring expenses through 2024, and that will conclude the spending. Upon completion of our restructuring program, we expect to generate 11 million to 13 million in annual savings from our actions and expect a portion of those savings to be realized, starting in the second half of 2024. We anticipate selling the land and buildings at both Monrovia, California and Berryville, Arkansas. Turning next to liquidity and capital resources. During Q4 2023, we generated 26.5 million in cashflow from operating activities, which was up from 14.3 million in Q3 2023. For the full year 2023, we generated 31.1 million in cashflow from operating activities. This is despite cash payments of 10.7 million for restructuring and 18.3 million for taxes relating to changes in rules for R&D tax credits relating to 2022 and 2023.', 'At the end of the fourth quarter, we have available liquidity of 218.9 million comprising of the unutilized portion of our revolver and cash on hand. Our existing credit facility was put in place in July, 2022 at an opportune time in the credit markets, allowing us to reduce our spread, increase the size of our revolver, and allowing us the flexibility to execute on our acquisition strategy. Our debt through Q4 2023 was a 100% floating and linked to SOFR. As a result, as I highlighted before, the increase in our interest costs from 3.5 million in Q4 2022 to 5.4 million in Q4 2023 was driven by the runup in short term rates due to the fed rate hikes. In November, 2021, we had put in place an interest rate hedge that went into effect for a seven year period starting January, 2024, and pegs the one month term SOFR at 170 basis points for 150 million of our debt.', 'This will help drive significant interest cost savings in 2024 and beyond. To conclude the financial overview for Q4 2023, I would like to say that we had a strong finish to 2023 and anticipate another strong year in 2024. I would now like to turn it back over to Steve for his closing remarks. Steve?', ""Steve Oswald : Thanks, Suman. Just a couple more comments before we go to questions in closing. I think Q4 was a very good quarter with many highlights for the company and our shareholders. In addition, achieving all time highs for annual revenue and adjusted EBITDA of 757 million and 102 million respectively in 2023 are wonderful milestones, and I'm very happy for the hardworking to comment team and all of our other stakeholders for those achievements. I also want to mention that 2024 will be our 175th year of continuous operation here at Ducommun, a great achievement, and we'll be recognizing that through the year. Final note is our 2027 strategy, which we've talked about. We had a strong first year with both engineered products and aftermarket gaining a larger percentage of revenue for the company in 2023 versus 2022, and the future is very bright. With those remarks, I will conclude and open up to questions.

If you want to skip our introduction to the global aircraft industry and the latest trends, then you can take a look at the Top 5 Aircraft Manufacturers In The World. ', 'The aircraft industry, just like consumer technology, has been making a lot of news over the past couple of months. This is because, at least when the Western world is concerned, there are only two primary aircraft manufacturing companies whose jets are capable of supporting large scale commercial operations. These are the U.S. aerospace giant The Boeing Company. (NYSE:BA) and its European counterpart Airbus SE (EPA:AIR.PA). Together, the duo dominates the industry for commercial aviation that is led globally by players the likes of Delta Air Lines, Inc. (NYSE:DAL) and United Airlines Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:UAL).', ""What this means is that aircraft manufacturing has to be precisely managed and carefully monitored to ensure that the stringent requirements of a large tube of aluminum traveling at more than half the speed of sound at thousands of feet in the air are met. On this front, the global aviation industry was shocked when a Boeing 737 Max aircraft's door blew out while it was cruising at altitude. Well, what blew out wasn't technically a door. Instead, it was a door plug that budget airlines use to make room for extra seats, and subsequent investigations revealed that a refurbishment oversight had led to the plug missing crucial bolts that would have held it in place."", ""For Boeing stock, the news naturally wasn't greeted well by investors who had already stood by the firm during its recent lowest after crashes that claimed the lives of hundreds of people. The stock is down 18.8% year to date, even while its European rival's shares have appreciated by more than 5% this year so far. The nature of the aviation industry means that since Boeing supplies a substantially larger number of aircraft to airlines than it would have had there been multiple other manufacturers when its production lines stopped due to industry scares or inspection requirements, the impact is significant."", ""In the aftermath of the 737 Max incident, the company shared the impact of the pressurization it faced from regulators and customers in February. Boeing outlined that its aircraft deliveries had shrunk by a third in January, and led the firm to deliver 27 airplanes in January. Had the 737 Max incident not occurred, then Boeing's deliveries might have sat at 38 planes - a fact that underscores the potential impact on a quarterly income statement from a handful of bolts and a lack of oversight. This is particularly painful for Boeing, an established stock that does not pay dividends since it stopped them in the aftermath of the coronavirus pandemic."", ""Yet, the firm's size means that it nevertheless did manage to keep up with Airbus when it came to delivering jets. Airbus's January deliveries stood at 30 planes, and for Boeing, despite the fact that deliveries and orders predictably slowed down, it did manage to make inroads into China in 2024. The firm shared in February 2024 that it has delivered three 737 Max's to China, which had suspended Boeing's imports in 2019."", ""Of course, while commercial aviation dominates the global aviation industry when it comes to size, it is only one portion of the pie. Boeing also makes aircraft for the U.S. military, and along with planes made by Lockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE:LMT), these are capable of both stretching the limits of physics and ferrying service members globally. However, on this front, its Lockheed and Northrop Grumman Corporation (NYSE:NOC) are more prominent. While Boeing's B-52 Stratofortress, an aircraft named after the literal Stratosphere, is nothing short of a modern engineering marvel capable of delivering fear equally just as well as it can deliver armaments, it's Lockheed and General Dynamics's F-16 Fighting Falcon that is the backbone of the global defense aviation industry."", ""But Boeing, Lockheed, Airbus, and Northrop are not the only major aircraft companies. The final segment of this multi billion dollar industry, expected to be worth $626 billion by the end of this decade, is the one that's the most glamorous. This is the private jet industry, and it is dominated by players such as the formidable Brazilian firm Embraer and the well known Gulfstream Corporation.

You're listening, to Motley Fool Money. I'm Ricky Mulvey, joined today by Nick Sciple. Nick, good to see you."", ""Nick Sciple: Great to be back here with you Ricky. I on Mardi Gras as a Mobile Alabama native. The home of Mardi Gras in the US. It's a great day for me and I'm excited to be here with you."", ""Ricky Mulvey: Happy Mardi Gras. Not so happy day for the stock market. Got an inflation report that it wasn't to not celebrating quite like they are down in Mobile, Alabama and in Louisiana. Market appears to be taking a breather as the CPI print came out to three and we got to use decimals here, I'm sorry, 3.1% on the year. The economists wanted 2.9%. This is a rounding error Nick. Is this really a bad report or is this an excuse to sell?"", ""Nick Sciple: Maybe both. I guess I would answer your question, yes. Not either or, just yes. It's a bad report just in the sense that came in worse than expectations for some market participants out there. That is a reason to sell. As we all talk about or know, valuations reflect expectations about the future, the higher those expectations are, the more the market is going to react, and reality fails to match those. Foolish investors are probably familiar with what happens when companies report earnings and businesses put out results that are different than the market expects. We'll talk about an earnings report here in a little bit. Macro also responds to expectations. In this case we've seen the market coming in today. Was up over 5% year to date in part. That was driven by expectations that the Fed might be getting ready to cut interest rates. Following today's inflation report market expectations for a Fed rate cut in March have fallen down to below 10% a month ago. Those expectations, we're discounting a 70% chance of a rate cut and so that change in expectations, how it affects valuation models, really is what's driving the selling today."", ""Ricky Mulvey: The Fed's not just looking at 0.2% miss, it's looking for the long term trends and that still appears to be good on inflation. I don't know. It always seems like those equity analysts are a little quick on the trigger to me. Let's look inside the report. There is some good news for people who buy stuff because inflation overall is slowing down. You've got used vehicle prices down about 3.5%, overall, grocery prices down about the same amount. Apparel down about a little less than a percent. The bad news, it's always mixed, you've got shelter prices up on the month, 6% year over year. It doesn't look like a huge deal to me. I saw a headline in the New York Times that said stock sink is stubborn inflation resets Fed forecasts. This is alarmist, Nick."", ""Nick Sciple: It could be, if you want to look on the bright side, the rate of the change is slowing down while we still have inflation coming in at 3.1%. That's lower than what we saw in December at 3.4%. We're slowly but surely ticking down toward that 2% target that the Fed goes after. However, I do think, the stickiness of inflation, this sticking around for longer than the market expects, and shows that inflation is stickier than the market had expected. I think historically expectations about inflation are real drivers of inflation. It could mean that market expectations maybe have stuck in. I will say looking at that shelter price inflation number, we still remain in a market where real estate is scarce. You see that in the valuations of companies out there in the market, limited resale inventory leads, brokers really having a tough time, but folks selling new homes are at all time highs and really sitting pretty. I think that that's part of what we're seeing in that shelter inflation number."", ""Ricky Mulvey: Maybe a reason to look at some home builders. Let's move to the Shopify earnings. What a tough day to release earnings that miss a couple of expectations for a growth stock. The earnings in the stock though, telling two very different stories. Usually, you hear about a company beats earnings, but then they issue softer guidance, so the stock falls, that's the PayPal story from about a week ago. This time we've got an earnings beat, we've got a swing to operating profitability. How about that year of efficiency guiding for 20% revenue growth, that's in line with Wall Street expectations. The stock is down more than 10% this morning. What's the street so fussy about?"", 'Nick Sciple: Again, it comes down to expectations. As you mentioned, revenue growth, guidance, strong. However, operating expenses are going to come in a little bit heavier than the market was anticipating. As you said, look at this fourth quarter, this quarter just completed really strong performance. Hard to argue with any of those numbers. Revenue up 30% when you exclude the divestment of the logistics business. In 2023, it was the largest revenue quarter in the company\'s history. Gross profit delivered another company record up 33%, free cash flow margin at 21%. Shop Pay doing very well, just gross merchandise volume up 32%. Year over year and now it used on 60% of transactions on the platform. Even offline, the company is doing very well, offline gross merchandise value up over 20% year, every year. Looking backwards number is great everywhere, looking forwards. Again, if you look at the revenue number, great. You cited that 20% revenue growth number, if you exclude the logistics business, again, which has been divested, you\'re looking at more like a 25% plus revenue growth rate which is pretty good. Gross margin expected to expand. That\'s good. But again, as I mentioned, operating expenses is where the problem shows up. Guidance calls for a low teens increase in operating expenses. If you treckle that forecast down, you\'re looking at an operating income number somewhere in the 170 plus million dollar versus expectations, we\'re in the $380 plus million. For analysts out there in the market, you\'re also seeing free cash flow margin expected to fall meaningfully down to a high single digit percentage of revenue from over 20% we just saw in the most recent quarter. It is interesting though, driving into those increases in operating expenses. Management said there\'s two things behind that increase. One is employee costs. The company is citing payroll taxes that they\'re going to have to manage in the next coming quarter as well as employee compensation increases. Although you\'re not going to increase headcount folks do have some of these raises that kick in at the start of the year. But the other one is a little bit more interesting, which is marketing expenses. The company says it\'s going to push harder on performance. Marketing claims to have improved its performance. Marketing performance, saying, ""It\'s unlocked some opportunities to reach potential customers at highly attractive lifetime value to customer acquisition costs and payback periods Including reducing payback over 30% through the use of AI and automation."" Really they\'re saying our marketing is performing better than expected. We think we can get better results than we\'ve seen in the past. We\'re going to push even harder on spending. If they\'re right, this increased spending today will result in significant returns in the future, so we shouldn\'t be upset about this increased operating expenses, but that really time will tell whether those results pan out. I\'m going back to sum it all up. Good results in previous quarter however the company is spending more than expected, which has folks selling the stock but if those investments prove out, this might be a buying opportunity for long-term investors.', ""Ricky Mulvey: You're telling me a growth company is acting like a growth company?"", ""Nick Sciple: I guess so. Founder led company, willing to invest where they see opportunities out there in the markets and willing to take the short term lumps to make that happen. We'll see whether those investments pay out, but management has said, we think that there's opportunities here and we're going to go after them."", ""Ricky Mulvey: Let's take a look at some of the strategy highlights from management. You tell me if any are worth investors' attention. One is that it's going more into the B to B commerce space. Signing a deal with carrier. They do some systems introducing a ship to store from, I haven't said Spotify, Shopify point of sale, which allows brick and mortar locations to ship online orders. A little bit of a departure from owning warehouses with Flexport. You've also got, speaking of marketing, Mr. Best, promoting the Shopify app, putting out a video that was by 40 million views larger than the biggest audience for the Super Bowl this year. You've also got some AI Copilots. We've got to have AI in their, Nick. You've got AI Copilots, photo editing tools, that thing. Any of these strategic initiatives worth investors attention?"", ""Nick Sciple: Well, the Mr. Best one stood out to me just because it dovetails with that management commentary around expanded performance marketing spend ways to reach more potential customers at attractive prices that this Shoify of Mr. Best video has over 165 million views, help drive a spike in downloads for the shop app. This collaboration comes after the company did another collaboration with Drake last year, which presumably must have had some good results to see continued spending. It could be that the expanded marketing spend the company is talking about which means we'll see even more of these partnerships to try to juice growth in the business. If they're seeing good results in the numbers they're talking about, then that's good spending."", ""Ricky Mulvey: Let's talk about the price for a second. In 2021, Shopify traded at a 60X60 revenue multiple. Now it's at 15X. I say this firmly with my tongue in cheek. Are you ready to call this a value stock?"", ""Nick Sciple: I don't know about a value stock, Ricky, but definitely more in line with where the company has historically traded. Really saw a massive multiple expansion in 2020, in 2021. That said, multiple has expanded a bit from where we saw the company this time last year. I'd just say it's not a value stock, it's a rule breaker. This is a company that's always traded over 10x sales, has always looked expensive when you just look at the trailing numbers, but it's also a business that is undoubtedly the top dog in its industry and that continues to expand its market every year. You talk about business to business sales. I talked about the offline business growing at a 28 percent rate. This is not just a company that's captured it's market but is growing, creating new markets year after year. I think that's the type of company that can continue to be at the market's expectations even when they're very high. If they can keep doing that, then it's best days are still ahead of it."", ""Ricky Mulvey: Let's talk about a big deal in the golf community, which I know you're following. Earlier this year, Tiger Woods left Nike. Now he's got a new brand with TaylorMade Golf equipment. It's called Sun Day Red. Woods is getting his own headquarters designers and staffing. Looks like it's functioning as its own business. TaylorMade management confirmed that Sun Day Red is planning to launch a golf shoe early next year, if not sooner. You told me this was a big deal and really interesting, why is it? Why is this a big deal?"", ""Nick Sciple: Sure. Well, obviously anytime you hear the name Tiger Woods in golf, it's a big deal. He's the Michael Jordan of the sport with this Sun Day Red brand getting built out. Sounds like the Jordan brand for golf, which maybe Nike took a crack at doing over the past 27 years, but wasn't able to have the success that they hope to have. Clearly, that's why they've reduced investment in the business. Woods has had a relationship with TaylorMade going back to 2017. That's when Nike exited the club's business. This expands Tiger's relationship with TaylorMade into the apparel area that he had retained the apparel relationship with Nike even after going to another club manufacture. But this movement into not just an apparel relationship but TaylorMade now going to launch a golf shoe as part of the Sun Day Red brand early next year, if not sooner. This is a segment that TaylorMade currently doesn't operate in. If you go to the golf shoe segment of TaylorMade's website, you see two flip flops and one old out of date women's golf shoe from an old collaboration. This is really breaking into meaningful segment of the golf apparel market that the TaylorMade has not traditionally operated in. I follow a company we've talked about here on the podcast, I guess around this time last year, Kushnet Holdings. Ticker is golf. They're really the top dog in this segment with their FootJoy brand. That's one that Tiger had been wearing on tour since separating from the Nike apparel relationship. You've seen that stock down about five percent this morning concern about, well, with this new brand entering into the market, could that change competitive dynamics in the space? For my part, I'd like to see the Sun Day Red brand prove it first. Nike really made lots of efforts to break into the golf business and had some issues."", ""Dedicated golfers tend to stick to the products they like. They're a pretty particular bunch. While dedicated golfers, this group is only about 15 percent of players. They spend about 70 percent of the dollars in the sport. That's an area where FootJoy already has some really strong relationships. Unlikely to dislodge those established relationships. However, for new and beginning golfers, really this is an opportunity to capture them or to shift golfers away from some other brands. One other thing worth mentioning, TaylorMade last year made an investment in Popstroke, which is a top golf, but at put version of that is an area that Tiger's also invested in. You could see some synergies with the Sun Day Red brand in that investment in the way that TopGolf tries to push Callaway products and Travis Matthew products. You could see this Popstroke retail location being used as a way to try to push this Sun Day Red brand."", ""Ricky Mulvey: If you were in the TaylorMade boardroom, is this a deal you would have gone after? Tiger, I would say, is synonymous with Nike. Now you have the TaylorMade and their owners, which is the hilariously titled private equity firm, Centroid Investment Partners, credit where credit is due to their creativity. Tiger has got some risks. He's on the tail end of his career and it's going to be really expensive to get him to wear your shoes. Is this going to be worth the money?"", ""Nick Sciple: Well, we'll see. I certainly would have kicked the tires on it if I was again Centroid, if I was TaylorMade. Tiger is the most influential famous golfer in the business, is going to be the one who's most likely to move the needle for you. It all depends on the price. There are some real risk though. You mentioned Tiger being at the end of his career. Folks might not remember three years ago really seriously injured himself in a car accident. Could have ended his career there. Has had some issues in the past with operating a motor vehicle. Not only that, the career coming to an end, there are some risks that some unexpected things could happen with Tiger. But I think private equity managed business looking to make a big splash. Maybe this company would like to go public at some point in future. The Tiger relationship would be helpful for that. Let's just say that. There's a risk to the deal but I think it's the type of thing that you have to go after if it's presented to you."", ""Ricky Mulvey: Nick Sciple, I'm glad you're not at Centroid Investment Partners.

Which means tomorrow is Ash Wednesday and Valentine's Day at the same time. What do our friends in Mobile and New Orleans do? Which is more important?"", ""Jason Moser: Well, for some people it's a day of fasting, so that does not make for a very romantic [OVERLAPPING] ."", 'Bill Mann: This is my point. Sorry. I was thinking about that earlier and I thought that I would bring it to the Grand Council.', ""Allison Southwick: Thank you. I have no answers for you, but I'm sure someone in our audience does. No more questions except the ones coming from me. Are you ready?"", ""Jason Moser: Yes ma'am."", 'Allison Southwick: Here we go. First thing I want to know about is your first love by which we mean the first stock you ever bought. Jason, tell us about that first love.', 'Jason Moser: Oh, the first love, the one that I bought first. The first stock I ever bought. Let me think about this for a minute.', ""Allison Southwick: Bill Mann, why don't you go first?"", ""Bill Mann: He didn't do his homework. My first love was impetuous, it was irresponsible."", 'Bill Mann: It was a little company called Midcom that I thought was going to go to the moon and it went to the moon in a very aggressive way.', 'Jason Moser: What did they do?', 'Allison Southwick: [laughs] What did it have done? This metaphor-loving day for stock.', 'Bill Mann: [laughs] They lost bunny, is what they did mainly. They were super good at it. I learned from the first, and the second was Berkshire Hathaway.', 'Allison Southwick: That worked out.', ""Bill Mann: That's the rebound."", 'Bill Mann: I think that was a good rebound.', ""Jason Moser: I think this is interesting because the first stock I personally bought, it's not the first stock I ever owned because I got gifts from my father along the way. But the first one I ever purchased on my own was Cisco."", 'Bill Mann: The forks and knives company?', ""Jason Moser: No, I'm saying it was the tech company, Cisco and that was back in 2000ish. You do the math, it wasn't really an opportune time to be purchasing."", 'Allison Southwick: But everyone was talking about it, like you turned on CNBC and it was like Cisco.', 'Jason Moser: Exactly. That was the first one I ever purchased on my own. I did that with the assistance of my, at the time, Edward Jones, account representative, when my dad had opened up that brokerage account.', 'Allison Southwick: He introduced you guys?', 'Jason Moser: He introduced us, he facilitated the relationship.', ""Bill Mann: He was the batch baker. Little did you know that he was actually talking about the forks and knives company, but you just didn't pay attention."", 'Bill Mann: Do you still own it?', 'Jason Moser: I do not.', ""Bill Mann: Because I think it's still down from that. I don't think it has ever recovered its price."", 'Allison Southwick: Wow.', ""Bill Mann: From then. That's a long-term buy-and-hold-and-cry."", 'Bill Mann: We will come back to this one a little bit later.', ""Allison Southwick: Will we? A little foreshadowing. Our next question is, what's your number? By which we mean, how many stocks do you own today?"", 'Bill Mann: My number is complicated.', ""Jason Moser: It's complicated. He's giving a status updates here."", ""Bill Mann: I'm giving you a status. It's complicated. Well, because they are the stocks that you own for your kids and so things of that nature. But my number is 26."", 'Allison Southwick: Really?', 'Bill Mann: Which I understand to be more than some and fewer than most.', ""Allison Southwick: It feels a little low, but I mean, I know you're an upstanding guy and a good investor, so I think those are going to be quality 26. I pulled that out."", ""Bill Mann: Twenty of them are good, 6 I'm angry at. I've owned most of them for a very long time."", 'Allison Southwick: How long is a very long time?', ""Bill Mann: Well, Berkshire Hathaway was the second stock that I bought and I still own it. So that's more the case than not the case for me."", ""Allison Southwick: Jason, what's your number?"", ""Jason Moser: My number right now it's 35 different publicly traded companies. Now I will say I own stock in the Motley Fool because we are fortunate enough to be able to do that, so 36 technically, but that's not really true because most people don't have that opportunity to own shares in such a wonderful business as ours so 35 and I kind of like Bill, I've always felt that number could be lower. But as I get older, I kind of default to not selling. If it's not working, it's not working, I still want to give it a chance, but it's not something I'm adding to. The number does seem to kind of grow a little bit as, as I get older as well so 35."", ""Allison Southwick: Maybe I'm wrong, but I feel like our listeners would be surprised to know that you guys are, that's how many stocks you own because you work at a company that recommends buying stocks. I would think that you would just be constantly adding. But I don't know."", ""Jason Moser: Well, it'd be nice if we could, but I think it's also always worth remembering that we have internal trading guidelines here that make it a little bit more difficult for us to just be able to buy and sell whenever we want, right? So because we're in the business of offering advice and writing about those companies, we have those internal guidelines that just make it a little bit more difficult for us to be able to transact like our members can."", 'Bill Mann: Allison, let me tell you a love story.', ""Allison Southwick: I want to hear. That's why we're here."", ""Bill Mann: This is how this works. Yes, we do recommend companies all the time, but I find it's the ones that you know for a really long time that sometimes turn out to be better opportunities than the brand new thing, which you don't know as well, it's just shiny and beautiful and you have not figured out its faults just yet."", ""Bill Mann: Fool's gold. Out of curiosity, are those the only investments you own or do you also complement that with mutual funds, index funds, anything like that?"", ""Jason Moser: Well, I guess I actually do own a little bit in an S&P index fund, but that tends to be kind of a vehicle. It's other than that, real estate I think and that's kind of where it draws. I'm no crypto, no gold for me just yeah."", ""Bill Mann: I've got the usual, you know, Panamanian farmland and molybdenum and things like that. I've got some fun. Those sorts of things."", ""Allison Southwick: Our next question is, what's the one stock that you've married? By which we mean a stock that you never see yourself selling out of entirely?"", ""Jason Moser: Well, I'm sure everybody would be just absolutely flabbergasted to hear that. I'm going with McCormick, so I will it's just such an answer for me because it's a stock that I've owned for a long time. It's one that I've continued to add to as I get older, it fits only more and more into my retirement strategy with dividends. The dividend aristocrat, I assume that at some point here, it will be a dividend king. I will cook as long as my body and mind allow, which means that my kitchen will always be just stocked with McCormick spices and flavors, and whatnot."", ""Bill Mann: Jason Moser by a number of hours, how long has it been since you've consumed something that McCormick makes?"", 'Jason Moser: Well, had dinner last night.', ""Bill Mann: That's not a number, but OK."", ""Bill Mann: I'm not so good with my math Bill."", 'Allison Southwick: Bill. How about you? Which stock have you married?', 'Bill Mann: Jason. Can you guess mine? I could have guessed.', 'Jason Moser: I imagine Berkshire Hathaway or Costco.', ""Bill Mann: Thank you. Costco. Costco, a couple of weeks my wife, and I went in to get one item and we came out with 29. It's just the two of us now. We're not buying useful things for kids running around, we just came out with 29 items and I think about that a lot."", 'Jason Moser: They were well-priced and take up a lot of space.', 'Bill Mann: These both are true.', ""Allison Southwick: This week, because Valentine's Day is tomorrow, we're talking about love. Our last question for today is, who taught you the most about love? I'm looking for a stock that taught you your most valuable investing lesson."", 'Bill Mann: It all comes full circle because I go back to Cisco.', ""Allison Southwick: Let's hear this Tale of love."", ""Bill Mann: I wrote about this years back when I first got here. Your biggest investing mistakes. One of my biggest investing mistakes was ultimately investing in something that I didn't even know, I didn't understand. I did what this representative told me to do and I just took it at blind faith and just said, OK, no, that sounds great in hindsight obviously, it didn't work out so well. It was not the right thing to do. Cisco always stood out to me, whenever I see that ticker, it's a reminder to me, make sure you know what you're getting into. I look at Cisco as one of those ones that always stands out."", ""Jason Moser: Can I provide a Cisco-related lesson, from someone else, a fellow who used to be our tax expert on our discussion boards Phil Marty sadly passed away a few years ago. But he talked about how he held on to Cisco through the .com days because he didn't want to pay the taxes on it. Well, the market took care of that because he took care of all those gains so he didn't have to pay any taxes. The lesson there, of course, is if it's the time to sell something, don't let taxes deter you from what is the right move for your situation."", ""Allison Southwick: If it's time to break up with someone, we got to torture this metaphor."", 'Jason Moser: This metaphor has gotten off too easy. [laughs]', ""Bill Mann: Mine is also a tale of woe and it is basically this. When someone tells you who they are, you should believe them. The company is called Nuance Communications. It was purchased a few years ago, but it was a company that I bought and held forever because they had all of the licenses and technology for voice recognition technology back in the day when this was the shiny new thing and you didn't expect your refrigerator to respond to you. To this day, their successor company owns all of it, so they get paid but their executive team made sure that all of that money stayed within the building of Nuance Communications and they paid themselves so much money that really nothing ever trickled down to shareholders. After a while, you just have to realize, and this is what I realized from this relationship, that you have to understand that a management team that does not seem willing to pay down to shareholders, you should believe them and move on."", ""Jason Moser: You're putting so much into that relationship and you got nothing out of it."", ""Bill Mann: Nothing. They told me that's what was going to happen."", ""Deidre Woollard: They told you personally. They're like, Bill Mann I'm sorry but."", ""Bill Mann: Yeah. In the middle of the conference call and Bill no, you looked at me like I was serious. Totally not serious. No. They tell you in things like the proxy statement. That's their love letter and it was all about them."", ""Allison Southwick: Yeah, that's a good one. Well again, this week we're talking about love. Next week you're going to be coming back to talk more about loss. We're going to talk about the stock that got away, the stock you should have dumped earlier. The stock that really broke your heart, and that one time, you cheated. Yeah, that's right. Jason."", ""Jason Moser: Don't understand why you're looking at me."", ""Allison Southwick: You're the one that made the most guilty face so maybe we work on that."", 'Jason Moser: Nervous tick.', ""Allison Southwick: Thanks, guys, we'll see you next week."", 'Jason Moser: Thanks.', 'Bill Mann: Thank you.', ""Ricky Mulvey: As always, people on the program may have interests in the stocks they talk about in the Motley Fool, they have formal recommendations for or against so buy or sell anything based solely on what you hear.

We appreciate the opportunity to review our fourth quarter and full year 2023 results and provide an update on our outlook for 2024 and beyond. To begin on Slide 5, I'd like to highlight some key data points that we believe are reflective of our strong commitment to operational excellence in our core company values in 2023, we continued to deliver world-class results in terms of product quality, program launches and service for our customers. This is reflected by our 98% green product quality scorecards and 97% green program launch scorecards. Even more importantly, we had our best year ever in terms of employee safety for the full year 2023, our safety incident rate was just 0.32 per 200,000 hours worked surprise, surpassing our previous best for 2022 and well below the world-class benchmark of 0.57. We're especially proud of our 24 plants that completed the year with a perfect safety record of zero recordable incidents. Dedicated teams in these plants continue to affirm that our long term goal of zero safety incidents is achievable. We also delivered strong revenue growth in 2023 through a combination of new program launches and successful implementation of sustainable pricing. Overall, our overall our total sales increased by 12%, significantly outpacing industry production. I want to thank our commercial team for their achievements during the year as they worked closely with our customers to ensure we receive fair value for the products and services we provide. In addition to the top line growth, we had another solid year in improving operating efficiencies our manufacturing and purchasing teams combined to deliver $56 million in cost savings through defined lean programs and initiatives. Combining increased operating efficiencies with our enhanced commercial agreements, we were able to more than offset continuing inflation headwinds and deliver over 500 basis points of improvement in gross margin for the year. Importantly, the margin expansion is continuing in all of our operating segments. And for the first time, all four segments were profitable at the EBITDA level for the full year, we've made a lot of progress over the past two years but we recognize we have more work to do. We expect to build on the successes of 2023 to drive further value for all of our stakeholders in 2024. Turning to page 6, complementing our focus on manufacturing efficiency and customer service excellence is our commitment to doing business the right way with uncompromised honesty, transparency and integrity. This is one of our core values is an important component of our overall company culture. It's who we are several weeks ago. We were pleased to once again be named to Newsweek's list of America's Most Responsible Companies. We see this type of recognition as an external acknowledgment of the quality of our company culture and how we conduct ourselves every day. We believe our culture is key to recruiting and retaining the best talent in our industry and further when combined with world-class technology and customer service. It's an important factor in winning and retaining business from our customers around the world. Now let me turn the call over to John to review the financial details of the quarter."", 'Roger Hendriksen', ""Thanks, Jeff, and good morning, everyone. in the next few slides, I'll cover the details of our quarterly and full year financial results, put some context around some of the key items that impacted earnings and then provide some color on our cash flow, balance sheet and liquidity. So please turn to Slide 8. On Slide 8, we show a summary of our results for the fourth quarter and full year 2023 with comparisons to the prior year. Fourth quarter 2023 sales totaled $673.6 million, an increase of 3.7% versus the fourth quarter of last year, we were able to achieve this growth despite the lost sales related to the UAW work stoppage and the sale of our technical rubber business in Europe. As well as our share of a joint venture in Asia earlier this year or earlier last year. Adjusted EBITDA for the fourth quarter 2023 was $27.6 million or 4.1% of sales, essentially in line with our results for the fourth quarter of 2022, despite the impacts of the strike on a US GAAP basis, we incurred a net loss of $55.2 million in the fourth quarter. This included certain noncash charges for pension settlements, restructuring and asset impairments. Excluding these and other special items, we incurred an adjusted net loss of $31.1 million or $1.79 per diluted share for the fourth quarter of 2023. This compared to an adjusted net loss of $31.9 million or $1.85 per diluted share in the fourth quarter of two 2022. For the full year 2023, our sales totaled $2.8 billion, an increase of 11.5% versus 2022. Again, the main drivers of the increase were favorable volume and mix and our new enhanced commercial agreements with the UAW strike and the divestitures being partial offsets. Adjusted EBITDA for the year came in at $167.1 million compared to $37.9 million for the full year 2022. Favorable volume and mix, including sustainable price adjustments and inflation recoveries, improved operational efficiencies and lower raw material costs. What are the key drivers of the improvement CONTINUING and inflationary pressures, unfavorable foreign exchange and higher performance-related compensation were partial offset. Full year net loss was $202 million. This included the loss we incurred on refinancing and extinguishment of debt, restructuring expenses, pension settlement charges and other special items adjusted for the net impact of these items, we incurred a net loss for the year of $82.3 million, or $4.74 per diluted share. This is a significant improvement when compared to the adjusted net loss of $171.5 million at $9.98 per diluted share we recorded in 2022 from a CapEx perspective, we spent $80.7 million in 2023, which is around 2.9% of sales. This compared to CapEx of $71 million or 2.8% of sales in 2022. Moving to slide 9, the charts on slide nine and 10 quantifies the significant drivers of the year-over-year changes in our sales and adjusted EBITDA for the fourth quarter and the full year respectively. For sales in the fourth quarter, favorable volume and mix, including customer price adjustments and recoveries, increased sales by $25 million. This was net of approximately $31 million in lost sales related to the UAW strike. Foreign exchange added $11 million, while divestitures were an offset of $11 million for adjusted EBITDA, favorable volume and mix, including price adjustments and inflation. Recoveries added $8 million in the quarter. This was net of approximately $10 million from lost volume related to the UAW strike, manufacturing and purchasing efficiencies accounted for another $15 million of the improved results. These improvements were offset by $17 million of general inflation, such as wage increases and higher energy expenses and $12 million in other items included in suite, including certain year end accrual adjustments. Moving to Slide 10. For the full year, favorable volume and mix net of customer price adjustments and recoveries increased our sales by $315 million. The full year sales impact of the UAW strike, which is included here was approximately $34 million unfavorable foreign exchange impacted sales by $5 million and the divestiture of our technical rubber business in Europe as well as our share of a joint venture in Asia, further offset sales growth by $20 million combined for full year adjusted EBITDA, the positive factors included $171 million from improved volume and mix, including customer price adjustments and inflation recoveries, $56 million from improved manufacturing and purchasing efficiencies and $25 million in lower material costs. These improvements were partially offset by $65 million in higher wages and general inflation, $18 million in unfavorable exchange and $40 million in other items, including higher performance-based compensation year over year. The EBITDA impact of the UAW strike was approximately $11 million, which we included in the volume and mix category. Moving to slide 11, we were pleased to end the year with strong free cash flow of $62 million in the fourth quarter, net cash provided by operating activities was $79.7 million, an increase of $105.5 million compared to the same period last year. The increase was driven primarily by improved net cash earnings and changes in working capital as we were able to leverage the more stable production environment versus the prior year to better optimize inventories and accounts receivable as well as focusing on the collection of customer tooling receivables. Capital expenditures came in at $17.6 million for the quarter as we continue our intense focus on cash preservation and improving asset utilization with cash on hand of $154.8 million and an additional $162.4 million of availability on our revolving credit facility. We ended the year with total liquidity of $317.2 million based on our current outlook and expectations for light vehicle production, improving operating efficiencies and somewhat moderating inflation pressures. We believe our current cash on hand expected future cash generation and access to flexible credit facilities will provide ample resources to make required interest payments and support our ongoing operations. That concludes my prepared comments, so let me turn it back over to Jeff."", 'Jeffrey Edwards', ""Thanks, John. And to wrap up our discussion this morning, I want to share a few thoughts regarding our near term and longer-term outlook, and I remain extremely optimistic about our opportunities ahead. Moving to Slide 13 for one reason I'm optimistic is our culture of innovation and our success in bringing new technologies to market. In 2023, we were awarded $176 million in new business associated with our innovation products. We believe the reason is clear. We're adding value for our customers through new product innovations that solve technical challenges and help them achieve their sustainability objectives. Our digital tools and technologies are helping us bring new ideas and solutions into the market faster than ever before, and we're pushing to even go faster, not necessarily because our customers' demand that would be faster. But because our technological advancements enable them to be faster more than ever, our innovations, digital tools and technical capabilities are driving opportunities and extending our competitive advantage. As always, we want to thank our customers for their continued trust and support. Turning to slide 14, one of the innovations we've recently introduced is the integrated coolant manifold. We have already sold this technology to a major customer for application on a significant electric vehicle platform, but it is adaptable to all types of vehicle ICE, hybrid or battery electric use of the manifold provides an elegant but simplified fluid delivery configuration that reduces assembly connections, helps stabilized fluid pressures and allows for enhanced airflow to optimize thermal management. This technology can be paired with our new Eagle flow technology to drive even further efficiencies within the thermal management system. And while these technologies solve problems and reduce costs for our customers, they create increased content per vehicle and a growth opportunity for Cooper-Standard. Turning to Slide 15. In our sealing business, a rapidly growing innovation is our flush seal technology plus seal offers enhanced vehicle esthetics and improved aerodynamics with only minor changes to the traditional door architecture. The technology was recognized as a finalist in the Society of Plastics Engineers, automotive Innovation Awards. So last year, but more importantly than industry awards are the customer program awards. We've already received contract awards for this technology on nine customer programs with more on the way these program awards with a variety of new and well-established OEMs around the globe. Turning to Slide 16. We're pleased to recently announce that we had expanded our Fortrex license agreement in the footwear industry and to finally be able to disclose that our partner in that agreement is Nike. As we disclosed in that announcement, the expanded agreement grants Nike, a limited exclusivity for the use of Fortrex in the footwear industry. It also allows Nike to develop their own proprietary extensions of Fortrex technology for potential use in additional product lines and applications. Volume-based financial terms of the agreement remain in place. So as Nike expands their use of Fortrex, it creates upside financial opportunity for Cooper-Standard. We believe this expanded agreement is further validation of the significant potential opportunities that our Fortrex technology offers. Of course, we're also continuing our own development of new versions of Fortrex for automotive applications, including micro dense four tracks and 80 65 for tracks that offer lower weight, improved compression set, increased design flexibility and advantaged carbon footprints. Our enhanced Fortrex automotive portfolio will be rolling out to the markets this year and next year, which will be key to capturing additional sales and market share in automotive sealing. Turning to slide 17, in 2023, our Industrial and Specialty Group made significant progress in optimizing that business and setting the stage for accelerated profitable growth. This business, like many others, faced several challenges in the aftermath of the pandemic. Supply chains were disrupted tight labor markets led to high employee turnover and reduced productivity. And our planned end market demand for industrial products, frankly, was weak. The ISG. team has done a great job in resolving these issues, and they are now in the process of executing a new advanced marketing strategy to leverage digital marketing techniques to regain and expand market share. Key markets and focus are the high growth industrial segments of heating, ventilation and air-conditioning, major appliances, agricultural and construction. In addition, IASG is leveraging all of the best manufacturing practices and digital tools that have been developed and deployed to optimize our automotive operations. With these operational improvements in place, we expect IASG to achieve an average growth rate in excess of over 20%. The next three years and deliver adjusted EBITDA margins well in excess of 10% over that same period. Turning to slide 18, the successful turnaround of IASG as part of our continuing focus on controlling cost and optimizing our operations globally. We've made excellent progress in reducing fixed costs, which we expect to leverage to drive increasing profitability as global production volumes continue to ramp up we're maintaining our commitment to fix unprofitable businesses and concentrate company resources in the areas that provide the greatest opportunities for future growth and improve cash flow. In some cases, the best opportunity for improving cash flow may be through exiting a business as we have done in the past. That remains an option as well. Turning to slide 19 to conclude this morning, let me provide a little color on the guidance we published in our press release yesterday afternoon. Our expectations for 2024 are for further margin expansion and more modest top-line growth. Current forecast suggests that global light vehicle production will be similar to last year. With our strong customer mix, new program launches and increasing content per vehicle, we expect our growth to outpace the industry in each of our key markets. We also expect to drive further cost savings through improved operating efficiencies and lean initiatives that will enable us to offset continued inflationary pressures to achieve our targets for the year. We need to continue to deliver world-class products and services and successfully negotiate with our customers to renew the small portion of our commercial agreements that don't automatically carry forward from last year. I'm confident that we will looking out beyond 2024. We see a lot of positive data points today that suggests significant upside opportunity for the automotive industry overall and for Cooper-Standard specifically in the coming years, record numbers of new licensed drivers, record high average age of the vehicle fleet in the US light vehicle inventories that despite recent improvements remain well below historical averages, all suggest consumer demand for new cars will remain strong and production will have to increase to keep up with these supportive dynamics, I'm increasingly confident that we can and will achieve our longer-term targets for profit margins and return on investment. Operator, let's open the lines for questions."", 'Operator', '(Operator Instructions) Kirk Ludtke, Imperial Capital.', 'Kirk Ludtke', ""Well, JEFF John, Roger, thank you for the call Baker, um, maybe on slide 19, maybe that's the best place to start on. So guidance is essentially flat revenue on flat production. I'm just wondering if maybe you could elaborate on the on the the 10 million in the bridge volume mix price are all three of those components positive. Is there a can you give us any color as to how big huge piece is yes, I think it's John, Tom."", 'Roger Hendriksen', ""While it's a small number, there is a lot going on in those in that one one column of the comments that Jeff made prepared wise is that we're going to be growing in excess of the regional markets in which we operate. So suffice it to say that our volumes in and of themselves will be will be positive. And then we'll continue to have some work to do with enhancing our commercial agreements on a go-forward basis as well. But that also comes back with the traditional contractual environment within which we operate here in the auto space as far as giving giving money back to our customers each year. So there's some puts and takes when you when you think about the price area overall, our mix for the year, we're seeing a different mix components as far as the types of vehicles being manufactured in each of the regions that's inherent in the S&P Global kind of a view of the world as well as what our customers are telling us is going to be built in 2024. So you do see some some regional differences as well as the type of platform, whether it's SUVCUV. light duty trucks, but then there's also a significant component of EV launches that continue to come on mine and be important part of the year-over-year story."", 'Kirk Ludtke', ""Got it. Thank you. That's helpful. With respect to the the production schedule. Is it the norm, the cadence for 2024? Is it the same seasonality or do you think it's different this year?"", 'Jeffrey Edwards', ""Becker to Jeff, I think it's predicted to be more normal. So I guess that's a slow start in the first quarter and comment on as you go through the year is kind of how I would describe it clearly are light vehicle production units and the guidance that we used for 24, as you can see, there are continue to be a bit conservative, I guess, as I would describe it. But the good news is we have truly reduced our overall cost base, especially our fixed costs, and we are prepared to make significant margin improvement. And even on those lower lower volumes. So based on my prepared remarks, you can tell I'm sure you know that the industry is we believe there's significant pent-up demand. We believe that many of the other metrics of or regarding our consumers and their appetite and interest in buying vehicles going forward continues to be to be positive. So at some point, we expect the volumes to begin to reflect that. But in the meantime, we've chosen to be a bit conservative there ourselves."", 'Kirk Ludtke', ""Got it. That's helpful. Thank you. And on the on slide 13, you mentioned net new business of one 76. Can you can you elaborate on that a little bit? And I'm assuming that the net number is are your market share stable?"", 'Jeffrey Edwards', ""Yes, just to clarify, currently the one 76 is simply innovation, a new new innovation sales. We tried to capture that to make that the point that sometimes when people talk about innovation, it's going to be the future right? And our point is that we have been capturing significant new business on innovation sales. We highlighted several of those innovations this year that are today that will impact this year's net new business as well as next year's just to make the point that we have the ability to differentiate ourselves in the market. So as new programs come out for bid as replacement programs come out for bid. We don't believe we're a me-too supplier. We are offering significant ways for our customers to improve the overall efficiency of their assembly to reduce overall costs and to improve the performance. And we don't have to think that we know that because we're booking business today with that our calling card. So we're really proud of that. I think as we go forward, our content per vehicle on these future launches will definitely reflect this increased content. So that often answers your question, but that's kind of the point we were making today."", 'Kirk Ludtke', ""Okay. That's that's helpful. With respect to market shares, do you feel like you're stable?"", 'Jeffrey Edwards', ""We've got it."", 'Kirk Ludtke', 'And then last question, you mentioned that there may be some addition by subtraction opportunities here in terms of exiting businesses that are consuming cash. Can you give us a sense for what the I guess is it negative EBITDA, what the negative EBITDA was in those businesses last year?', 'Jeffrey Edwards', ""Sure, Kurt, this is Jeff again. I think that the best news is that for the first time in our in our company's history. I think certainly I can speak for the last 12 years or so on. This is the first time that every one of our regions has has made a positive EBITDA and cash flow contribution to the Company. So I think that shows that the focus we've had on either exiting because we have or fixing because we certainly have and kept them that that works. And there's a lot of complexity that goes into that. I mean, certainly customers have a vote one way or the other. We certainly have a vote one way or the other. And I think we'll just continue to march our way through country by country product by product, continue to look at the business in several different dimensions to ensure that we're operating at the lowest cost possible for us at the same time, reflecting the desire of our customers to pay us a fair price for what we're providing and that's kind of the approach we've taken. And we're very grateful that our customers continue to support us and trust us in our execution. It is what determines that right? I mean that I'm sure they like us, but the real fact is we execute, and that's why we're winning business. And so I think that will continue. And I don't have a list to answer your question of businesses that we will that we plan on exiting. We clearly continue to look at the evolving markets. We're looking at the customer makeup of the Company going forward and where that growth is going to come from. And we'll make appropriate decisions regarding our footprint based on where those growth opportunities are and make sure that we continue to drive return on invested capital on hire and all of the plans that we have in place today through that."", 'Kirk Ludtke', 'Wonderful. I appreciate it. Thank you about.', 'Jeffrey Edwards', 'Thanks for the questions.', 'Operator', '(Operator Instructions) Michael Ward, Freedom Capital.', 'Michael Ward', ""So good morning, everyone. I'm Jeff, maybe we can start with Nike and what you have there limited exclusive exclusivity. Could you define that a little bit? And then also when you say volume based financial terms, can you provide any definition for them?"", 'Jeffrey Edwards', ""Well, good morning, Mike. Thanks for the question. This is Jeff, the simplest way for me to describe this deal is Nike ask us have to put together a deal that would allow them to go faster in developing products across their portfolio and they felt like they were in a better position to do that faster with the proposed deal that we've agreed to. So we expect them to do that. We expect that there will be significant growth opportunities for us within the Fortrex portfolio. And when that happens, we get paid more money and it's really that simple. They're committed to the product they have launched the product and they plan on taking it across other lines in this agreement, allows them to go faster and hopefully allows them to grow it faster than what we were doing before."", 'Michael Ward', ""Okay. So you've licensed them the chemistry, correct?"", 'Jeffrey Edwards', ""I'm sorry, Mike, you broke up that you've licensed the chemistry, you're not selling the material. Just the chemistry that is correct each."", 'Michael Ward', ""Okay. And so right now, I think it's on two different sneakers or Twitter and choose. And so are you paid on a per sneaker type basis? Is that how it does how they do."", 'Jeffrey Edwards', ""We have a royalty stream set up based on their their volume. So as their volume goes up over over a period of time, that's how we're paid."", 'Michael Ward', ""Okay. And straight cash, it's just a straight hundred percent margin cash flow?"", 'Jeffrey Edwards', ""That's correct. Yes, we got no investment."", 'Michael Ward', 'Okay. Okay. John, on your page 10, when you look at the bridge on revenue and EBITDA of 22 to 23, you have the volume and mix. Is that where the recoveries are placed as it both on the revenue and the EBITDA side?', 'Roger Hendriksen', ""That's right, Mike, we put them in that volume and mix of columns, respectively, in both sales and adjusted EBITDA."", 'Michael Ward', 'Okay. So 23 was kind of a lumpy year because you had recoveries coming back from the one or two years prior. Is that correct?', 'Roger Hendriksen', ""Yes, that is the the cadence was it wasn't ratable for sure. If you recall back in Q3, we had some significant agreements reached that were retroactive. So it was a little bit lumpy, but you can appreciate the full year is a more representative view of all those price agreements that were reached to enhance our commercial arrangements."", 'Michael Ward', ""Okay. So now those things are reset. So as we go into 2024, with your assumptions that 10 million number. There's very little to no recoveries is or recoveries or potential upside in 2024 and EBITDA."", 'Roger Hendriksen', ""Yes, I mentioned that there's probably still some work to do around sustainable price in certain of our product areas as certain of our regions. So the team is still working diligently with our customers to make sure we're getting getting paid properly for the products and services we're providing. So again, some work to do there. But the nature of the industry is always such a contractual LTAs or givebacks. Our inherent in the POs. And oftentimes we have to overcome the owes. So you've got the team going to work on resetting prices, but dealing with the contractual overhang as well."", 'Michael Ward', ""Okay. So right now there's nothing really significant assumed in your assumptions for 2024?"", 'Roger Hendriksen', ""Well, there's pluses and minuses, Microsoft, right, like direct now."", 'Michael Ward', 'Okay.', 'Roger Hendriksen', ""As you look at one of the finish line but right, just to clarify, Mike, just to clarify all the deals reached, we've said in the past that what we've been able to reach agreements with our customers on 70% to 75% of that carries over into next year. So so your starting point still having that is the benefit of those arrangements."", 'Michael Ward', ""Right. And so and to what Jeff was talking about the big one comes in this years when you've been saying that for a while now that we see the benefits of the restructuring actions starting to unfold in 2024. We're starting to see that that's in your projection."", 'Jeffrey Edwards', ""Yes, that's correct, Mike and Jeff, I think that the best way for me to categorize all of that is that that I think we have reached a point of normalcy related to it. The price negotiations with customers that have gone on for, I don't know, 50, 60 years. I don't see this year being an abnormal one like last year or the year before it was. So we've reset it. You can see that on our margins, it's very clear and it would be nice to get more volume. I'll just leave it at that."", 'Michael Ward', 'And just lastly, on the segment data in that corporate other, you have a big negative in Q4 and for the year, it was more of a negative compared to last few years actually since 2018. I think was there anything in there or is it lumpy your enclosures? What happened in that data? Yes.', 'Roger Hendriksen', ""Yes, Mike, the we referenced the final year end accrual true-ups that we always have to do. And one of those is some incentive compensation related matters. The lumpiness you see is you have to wait till the end of the year to see how the overall ARM performance is against the commitments that are inherent in those plans. So that is one of the elements that are in that Q4 number of the to be fair that we don't charge out, if you will, all of the corporate costs and overheads so that always remains down. There's a negative line item in the segment perspective."", 'Michael Ward', 'Okay. Okay. So the last couple of years are more unusual where you had positive sense on that line.', 'Roger Hendriksen', ""Unfortunately, when there's positive adjustments that goes against goes the other way, if you unfortunately attrite."", 'Michael Ward', 'Okay, really appreciate. And thank you, everyone.', 'Jeffrey Edwards', 'Sorry, Mike. Thanks.', 'Operator', '[Ben Briggs, SaRonix Financial, Inc.]', ""Yes. Good morning, guys, and thanks for taking the questions. So I've got a few here. So as I go through your 2024 guidance. And if you kind of add those all up at the midpoint, you get to roughly free cash flow breakeven just using an EBITDA minus minus the cash costs and kind of kind of simple analysis. I know that working capital was obviously a tailwind for free cash flow generation this year and especially in the fourth quarter can you talk a little bit about what you expect working capital impact to be in fiscal 24?"", 'Roger Hendriksen', ""Yes, Ben, this is John. I'll take that one is you as you can appreciate we don't provide direct guidance on free cash flow, but your math is directional. We do see the path towards positive free cash flow overall in 2024 and we've made good progress in 23 to improve those working capital areas. Certainly inventory management and the focus on collection of customer tooling receivables were a couple of big areas and so there is still some room for improvement in many of those areas that probably won't be as significant as we saw in 2023 to be frank, but the incremental cash flows will certainly come from higher cash earnings overall, continued improvements in operating efficiencies and the volume that we're showing you here on the bridge walk across."", ""Okay, got it. But should we expect I know you don't you don't provide direct working capital guidance. Should we expect to see you figure out a more normalized inventory number, I guess right now or do you think it should be significantly different at the end of the year?"", 'Roger Hendriksen', ""Not significantly different, but there's certainly continuous improvement and optimization of those up. The biggest challenge in the last couple of years was obviously the volatility in production schedules from our customers. So it's really hard to continue to work with all those balances down when when the releases are changing so volatility. So as their production environment stabilizes and things get more more normalized and consistent, then we can go to work to continue to take that entire overall inventory balance down."", ""Okay, got it. Got it. Thank you. And then was I don't think you already answered this, but have all the while I know there's some one-time charge, especially in the third quarter from customers with one-time payments that positively impacted gross margins. It didn't look to me like there were many in the fourth quarter. Is that accurate? And can you just confirm whether or not you guys have received all the one-time drops that you're expecting your supposition is right."", 'Roger Hendriksen', ""There weren't a lot of those quote unquote, one-time or retroactive type deals. Reached in Q4. We said on the last call that around 25 to $30 million was booked in Q3 that didn't repeat here in Q4. And so once those deals are reached in September, call it the normal payment terms would have been such that we've received all that money that was booked in Q3 and Q4 already. So it's part of the working capital elements that we're able to collect on those receivables that were recorded in Q3."", ""Okay, got it. So not much not much to expect from that going forward. And then finally, when should we expect the Nike partnership and to be moving the needle? I know that you'd spoken of a few quarters ago that it was probably not going to make a major impact in the immediate term. But I wanted to see if there is maybe any positive news there that we should expect some tailwinds from that in the next couple of years?"", 'Roger Hendriksen', ""Yes, Ben, right now, we'll just leave it as a TBD, as Jeff described, the arrangement that Nike has and they want to move fast. So we'll monitor and see how how they progress and we'll be able to report those once they once they start cranking it up."", 'Okay. All right. I appreciate, Tom. Two questions.', 'Operator', 'Brian DiRubbio, Baird.', 'Brian DiRubbio', ""Good morning, gentlemen. A few questions for me. Just maybe starting off with CapEx spending. You spent more on CapEx as a percentage of sales in prior years. How should we think about that CapEx to sales number today? Is that do you consider sort of underspending a little bit? Or does do you think that's the new run rate for you going forward? Now?"", 'Jeffrey Edwards', ""This is Jeff. I think we mentioned in the last call and that 3% to 3.5% some years. If there's a lot of launches, you could get up closer to four. But I would say this is closer to the new normal to answer your question."", 'Brian DiRubbio', ""Okay, that's helpful. Thank you. And then just on working capital, I know you're not guiding to there, but as I'm sort of monitoring a bunch of commodities, I see steel costs up pretty significantly over the last couple of months. Rubber costs up pretty significantly. You know, I guess two parts of that a, you know, it is should we expect that a little bit of a build in working capital. The no does it make sense for the company make an investment in some of these products because there is price going to go higher and I see apologize for the multipart, but how are your contracts are structured so you can get compensated for those higher costs? What's the lag in that Thank you."", 'Roger Hendriksen', ""Yes, Brian, I'll take the second first. We've said in the past that we're reaching a point where most of our commodity buys are. We've got the index agreements with our customers to recover and that that was also in around the 70% ballpark. So as costs go up, then we were able to pass along that requisite amount. The rest of it, we can negotiate as long as the economic economics change, but that's the general go forward. And typically, those resets are either a quarterly or six month basis that we go back in. Many of them are automatic the PO just adjusts with those indices updates. And so the so that's kind of how we're viewing the world as far as the commodity commodities that we're exposed to are that we're buying. We don't see a significant increase in costs in 2020 for at least from the data points that we're using could even be a slight tailwind. But the good news is there. It's much more stable than it's been in the past couple of years. So so we've not seen a significant change in the overall commodity exposure front that will cause us to do anything differently in our business. And we do so given that you have no plans to make any investments in inventory at this point?"", 'Brian DiRubbio', ""No. Got it. And then just a follow-up question for me. Obviously, cash flow was good, but you're picking a good portion of your interest as those picks roll off? I know the ones in the first lien. Does that there this year? No. How are you thinking about sort of the balance sheet and liquidity?"", 'Roger Hendriksen', ""And I guess I put another way you does an equity raise on the table at any point, Brian, I said in my prepared remarks that we we think the cash flow generation and our continuous improvement activities to further rightsize the business, optimize our financial strength here going forward is going to be adequate from a debt service standpoint. And you'll see actually today when we file our 10 K later on. We've elected a straight pay on the third lien notes for the June coupon period. So we're confident that the cash flows will continue to be strong and we're able to make them make that decision six months in advance. So the as far as going forward into 25 or 26, I'm not going to talk about any strategic road map that we're thinking about because a lot of a lot can change in a lot of execution needs to happen between now and then, but the to your to your point, the the first and third lien non-call provisions come off Q1 of next year, so there could be opportunities there. If the interest rate environment is positive, we continue to execute and have successive cash flow generation patterns in front of us. So we'll see there's a lot to happen between now and then, but we're already already thinking ahead to two, what it means for us going forward as the business continues to execute and grow profitably."", 'Brian DiRubbio', 'Great. Appreciate all the color. Thank you so much.', 'Roger Hendriksen', 'Thanks, Brent.', 'Operator', '(inaudible), Beach Point Capital.', ""Hey, thanks for taking the time. Just a few questions from me. First, has there been any impact to the business from the supply chain disruptions, what's going on in the Red Sea?"", 'Jeffrey Edwards', ""This is Jeff. I think the of the supply chain issues that we were talking about the last couple of years have essentially been resolved. Does that mean in this industry that's extremely complex related to the supply chain that there aren't still some things that cropped up I suppose the answer to that is there are, but but I would say they've reached a point now where we could say that we've normalized our operations, right? We don't have that type of headwinds that we're dealing with. And for that reason, our costs have never been lower more competitive. Our operation from an execution point of view is world-class. The price recovery negotiations that we just went through with our customers have really restored the margin foundation that the company needs in order to create and generate the type of cash going forward. That's required. We had index agreements now that are in place that that ensure that the inflation, a roller coaster that that created some pretty big challenges for us is behind us innovation is strong. We've talked about that. We're just waiting for volume uplifts. And when that happens, the Company has never been positioned better to generate the type of free cash flow that we require going forward."", 'Roger Hendriksen', ""So probably the reason why our customers have been so supportive in zone here specific to the Red Sea issue, we don't move a lot of inventory through the Suez Canal, while you've probably read about some of the European customers are European OEMs being impacted by their supply chains, we have not seen a material impact at all from the from the Renzi issue."", 'Thanks. And then would you mind sort of helping us understand the step-up in manufacturing purchasing efficiencies this year from 56 million in 2023 to the guided $80 million happening there.', 'Roger Hendriksen', ""Yes, the pipelines, if you will also hear that the team is looking towards is really the sequential year-over-year improvements in their overall manufacturing operations in our purchasing area. So there's continued opportunities. Our team sees on the purchasing side as we as we work towards as a strategic supply base. We commonize the supply base for economies of scale work with a handful of strategic suppliers instead of spreading the purchases out, you get more bang for your buck that way. So there's still a pipeline of opportunities that we're continuing to see and some exciting things going on as far as how we how we analyze how we buy product and similar on the manufacturing side, it's more of a year-over-year number about how we continue to get more efficient, lean out the operations from a whether it's a product flow or a manufacturing flow standpoint, reductions in scrap opportunities, reductions in freight costs and the like all kind of weigh into that so many, many areas to attack and drive the continuous improvement that you see on the page. So to break it down a little bit for you discretely, it's probably about 60 40 of that $80 million. And that's you think about manufacturing versus the purchasing lean opportunities and then last one for me."", 'How should we think about timing and path to get to that double-digit margin target that you guys have previously highlighted?', 'Jeffrey Edwards', ""Yes, this is Jeff. I think if you if you project about two years with our with our current plans, that's kind of what we have, what we've been saying and what we've circled. I'd certainly like it to be helpful getting there faster if we get volume. But given the current projection from our customers as well as the the people that forecast volume in the industry, I would take a couple more years of what we've seen as growth within the industry to to have that line of sight. So that's that's the answer I'd give you. And we're hopeful that it's much faster if we get the volume that we believe pent up and available."", ""Sorry to clarify, do you think Bye getting to 10% margins is a couple of years out or you'll have visibility to it in a couple of years. As I said, I don't think we'll be there in two years to be in. Is that largely driven by volume or are there other major components here?"", 'Jeffrey Edwards', ""I think it's delivered by volume a bit. It's delivered by the content per vehicle related to the innovation sales that we've been talking about it's delivered by launching a business that has better margins and the business that it would replace going forward. It's driven by being profitable in all regions and all products that we're working our way to, as we talked about the end of this year were there that's continuing to improve upon those margins customer by customer country by country product by product. And we have a pretty good line of sight there and it's not cost reducing ourselves to prosperity. It's really launching a lot of the new business that will have higher content and higher margins because of innovation and other things that we've done with our fixed costs."", 'And then last one for me. How are you guys thinking about addressing your capital structure of the noncall period for your that will as we are.', 'Roger Hendriksen', ""This is the John, who am I kind of alluded to it in my my response to Brian, the non-call of comes off in Q1 of next year. So we're already looking to them to understand the market a little bit better, see what the interest rate environment does look like. But for us in particular right now, it's all about execution and delivering on our guidance and our commitments here, really centers around us, continuing to generate positive free cash flow and stabilize the business and take advantage of the market growth. That's ahead that Jeff just described for you. So no plans to announce here for yet, but we're already contemplating it's 11 months away that noncall provisions comes off. So we'll see how the year progresses and have some more specific as things go on. But suffice to say, we do see opportunities ahead as the business grows profitably to to bring down our overall debt service costs and go forward a little bit stronger portfolio."", 'Thanks for the time.', 'Michael Ward', 'Okay.', 'Roger Hendriksen', 'Thanks, Hunter.', 'Operator', 'It appears there are no more no more questions. I would now like to turn the call back over to Roger Hendriksen', 'Roger Hendriksen', ""say thanks, everybody, for your participation this morning for the good questions. If there is anybody out there that didn't get a chance to ask their questions, please feel free to reach out to me directly, and we'll arrange to have those questions answered again. Thanks. For your participation this morning. This will conclude our call.Thank you."", 'Operator', 'Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes your conference call for today.

However, in this case, the layoffs have investors worried about worsening demand and pricing challenges. Nike's retailing partners appear to be slowing their ordering rates and choosing to hold less inventory while cutting prices in many cases. Nike has been reducing its production pace for most of the past year, but apparently, further cuts are required."", ""Investors will likely have to wait for clarity until Nike's fiscal Q3 report, which is expected in late March. That report should detail Nike's full cost-cutting efforts, along with updates on its inventory levels and pricing.

Not only is that up from the $25 million he was awarded in 2022, it is more than his rivals Brian Moynihan and Charles Scharf made at Bank of America (BAC) and Wells Fargo (WFC)."", 'Only JPMorgan Chase (JPM) CEO Jamie Dimon and outgoing Morgan Stanley (MS) CEO James Gorman were awarded more for their 2023 performance. Citigroup (C) has yet to disclose 2023 compensation for its CEO Jane Fraser.', 'The compensation increase could be a sign that board support for Solomon is solidifying after he spent much of 2023 attempting a tricky retrenchment from consumer lending while focusing the firm on its core strengths of trading, asset management, and investment banking.', 'Profits were down 24% at the Wall Street giant as dealmaking slowed across the industry and the firm absorbed costs associated with its consumer lending exit.', ""Its full-year net income of $8.52 billion was the worst mark for Goldman since 2019, Solomon's first full year in charge.

Last month ex-Goldman CFO David Viniar was named as the board’s lead director to replace Adebayo Ogunlesi, who stepped down after selling his infrastructure investment company to BlackRock.', 'The board awarded Solomon, who serves as board chair, $29 million in a discretionary bonus of which 70% is performance-based stock units.

Additionally, the lender had to take action to protect its customers and employees. ', '“The OCC believes that the safety and soundness of the Bank and its compliance with laws and regulations does not require the continued existence of the Order,” the agency’s termination order dated last month said. ', 'The recent announcement marks the sixth consent order regulators have terminated since 2019, Wells Fargo CEO Charlie Scharf said in a Thursday statement. ', '“I have repeatedly said that implementing a risk and control framework appropriate for a bank of our size and complexity is our top priority, and closing consent orders is an important sign of our progress,” Scharf said. ', '“Confirmation from the OCC that we have effectively implemented what was required is a result of the hard work of so many of our employees…. We are a stronger, better Wells Fargo for our customers and communities, and we will not lose sight of the remaining work to do.”', 'He added that the bank’s top priority is still risk and control work. ', 'Wells Fargo came under the public eye in 2016 after a scandal highlighted that employees opened millions of unauthorized accounts without customers’ knowledge to meet lofty sales targets.', 'The lender’s previous CEO, John Stumpf, who led the bank since 2007, stepped down when the scandal broke out. The OCC fined Stumpf $17.5 million\xa0and banned him from the banking industry. ', 'Carrie Tolstedt, who served as Wells’ retail-banking chief at the time, pleaded guilty to one count of obstructing a bank examination in March. She agreed to pay a $17 million fine by the OCC for her part in the misconduct and faces up to 16 months in prison. The OCC also recommended fines of $18.5 million\xa0for three former Wells executives for their alleged roles in the 2016 scandal.', 'In May, the San Francisco-based bank agreed to pay $1 billion to settle a class-action lawsuit\xa0alleging it misled shareholders about its recovery from the fake-accounts misconduct. ', 'The Federal Reserve imposed a cap limiting the bank’s asset total to $1.95 trillion during the tenure of former CEO Tim Sloan, who took over the reins from Stumpf, to prevent it from growing until the regulators deemed the bank had fixed its shortcomings. The cap has yet to be lifted. ', 'The termination of the consent order “moves Wells Fargo a little closer to getting the Federal Reserve’s asset cap lifted, but we don’t think it’s quite there yet since a few other consent orders are still outstanding and scrutiny lingers over the bank’s financial controls,” Elliott Stein, a senior litigation analyst with Bloomberg Intelligence,\xa0told the publication. ', 'Though most investors believe the asset cap will be lifted in 2025, Ebrahim Poonawala, a banking analyst at Bank of America Securities, thinks the end could be nearer. ', '“[W]e believe the end of the OCC consent order today could cause the street to recalcitrance the probability that this could potentially occur in 2024,” he said in a note seen by Reuters. ', 'Scharf took over as the CEO in 2019 and is the fourth chief to lead the bank since the scandal erupted. ', '“Under Scharf’s leadership there have been several changes and he has been working to clean things up and it shows that he has got the confidence of the board, the rest of the management and also the regulators,” Stephen Biggar, director of financial services research at Argus Research told Reuters. ', 'Wells Fargo paid Scharf $29 million for 2023 – an 18.4% boost over the $24.5 million he received for 2022. He asked the bank’s human resources committee to “exercise negative discretion” and pay him less than it would have to reflect that “more work remains ahead” for the bank, Wells Fargo said in its filing at the Securities and Exchange Commission.

That's how some investors might feel about Pfizer (NYSE: PFE) and Bristol Myers Squibb (NYSE: BMY) these days. Both companies have generally maintained solid dividend programs, but right now they both face issues with slow or nonexistent revenue and earnings growth."", ""Pfizer and Bristol Myers Squibb have severely underperformed the S&P 500 over the past 12 months, and if these issues persist, things could get worse. Let's find out whether it's too late to buy shares of these passive income stocks."", ""Two years ago, Pfizer became the first company in the biopharma industry to hit $100 billion in annual sales. Things have changed dramatically since then. The drugmaker's COVID-19 portfolio, which fueled its record-breaking sales run, lost steam as the pandemic receded. Last year, revenue and earnings dropped off a cliff. This could affect its dividend program."", 'Unless the company can turn things around, management could change its capital allocation priorities and reduce its dividend payments. However, Pfizer is well on its way to staging a comeback. The first step in its plan was to earn a good number of brand-new approvals. Last year, they numbered seven, more than twice as many as any other company in the industry.', 'Some of these brand-new products were pretty groundbreaking, too. For instance, Pfizer launched one of the first vaccines for the respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) to ever get the green light from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.', 'Pfizer also decided to beef up its pipeline. It acquired Seagen, a cancer specialist, for $43 billion -- a move it could afford partly thanks to its coronavirus-related success. Seagen was already a highly innovative company within its specialized field of oncology. The partnership between the two could produce gems in the future.', 'It will take some time for Pfizer to recover fully, but the company is on the right track. New products will start contributing meaningfully to sales, its coronavirus vaccine will stop hurting its financial results, and it will produce yet more important medicines and vaccines.', ""Pfizer has raised its dividend per share by a decent 62% in the past 10 years. The company currently offers a yield of 6.1%. In my view, Pfizer's dividend program is safe, and it's not too late to buy the stock."", ""Bristol Myers Squibb's problems are somewhat similar to Pfizer's. Revlimid, a cancer medicine that used to be the drugmaker's best-seller, lost patent exclusivity about two years ago. Bristol Myers has yet to find a suitable replacement, and its revenue and earnings have been inching higher since -- at best. Thankfully, older products in the company's lineup are still having a positive impact; these include cancer drug Opdivo, one of its longtime growth drivers."", ""The biotech does also have a lineup of newer medicines approved since 2019. The bad news is that they aren't contributing nearly enough to the top line yet to help revenue growth improve significantly. Last year, the company's new products generated about $3.6 billion in sales, a 77% year-over-year increase."", ""However, total revenue for Bristol Myers came in at $45 billion, down 2% compared to the previous fiscal year. Major products that have lost patent exclusivity generated $7 billion in revenue, down 34% year over year; Revlimid accounted for $6.1 billion of that, or almost twice the company's entire new product portfolio."", ""Here's the good news. These older products will almost completely phase out of results within three years, while newer products grow in prominence and continue growing their sales for a long time. In the meantime, Bristol Myers should also launch other brand-new products."", ""The company's issues are nothing out of the ordinary in the biotech industry. Patient investors who stay the course have good reasons to trust that it can make a comeback while keeping its dividend healthy and growing. The drugmaker has increased its payouts by some 67% in the past decade; its dividend yield currently tops 4.8%. For dividend seekers, Bristol Myers Squibb still looks like a good pick."", 'Should you invest $1,000 in Pfizer right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Pfizer, consider this:', 'The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\xa010 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Pfizer wasn’t one of them.

Wall Street's major stock indexes have traded off bear and bull markets on a couple of occasions over the past four years."", 'Though 2023 represented a veritable running of the bulls, the Nasdaq Composite (NASDAQINDEX: ^IXIC) has, to some degree, been left behind by its peers. Whereas the Dow Jones Industrial Average and S&P 500 have ascended to new highs, the Nasdaq Composite closed out Feb. 15 about 1% below its record-closing high set in November 2021.', ""To some investors, the Nasdaq's inability to put its 2022 bear market blues fully in the rearview mirror suggests a lost two years for growth stocks. But for long-term-minded investors with cash at the ready, any notable downturn in the Nasdaq represents an opportunity to buy stakes in high-quality, fast-paced businesses at a perceived discount."", ""What follows are four electrifying growth stocks you'll regret not buying in the wake of the Nasdaq bear market dip."", ""The first spectacular growth stock you'll be kicking yourself for not picking up with the Nasdaq Composite still struggling to put the 2022 bear market in the back seat is none other than fintech leader PayPal Holdings (NASDAQ: PYPL). Despite increasing competition in the digital payments space, PayPal has the necessary catalysts to make its long-term shareholders notably richer."", ""For starters, investors should understand that there's room for more than one winner in the digital payments space. Based on estimates from Boston Consulting Group, annual fintech revenue can grow by a factor of six to $1.5 trillion by the turn of the decade. PayPal is leading that charge."", ""While it's been disappointing to see active account growth stymied -- active accounts fell 2% in 2023 from the prior-year period -- the key performance indicators that matter most are headed in the right direction. Total payment volume traversing PayPal's platforms grew by 12% on a constant-currency basis to $1.53 trillion in 2023."", 'More importantly, the average number of payment transactions completed by active accounts over the trailing-12-month period expanded to 58.7 by the end of December. This represents a 43.5% increase in average payment activity among active accounts since the end of 2020. Even if active account growth is slower than expected, existing accounts are more engaged with the platform than ever before. Since PayPal is a predominantly fee-driven business, this is a recipe for higher gross profit.', ""Don't overlook the company's shareholder-friendly moves, either. PayPal repurchased $5 billion worth of its common stock in 2023, and has targeted at least $1.3 billion in annual operating expense reductions (as of 2023) to improve the company's margins."", 'PayPal is also historically cheap, with its shares trading for less than 11 times consensus earnings in 2025.', ""A second electrifying growth stock you'll regret not purchasing in the wake of the Nasdaq's 2022 bear market swoon is U.S.-focused cannabis multi-state operator (MSO) Green Thumb Industries (OTC: GTBIF). Although marijuana stocks have been a buzzkill over the past three years, Green Thumb has set the standard for excellence among MSOs."", ""Despite cannabis reform bills failing to gain traction on Capitol Hill, medical and adult-use legalization efforts in individual states have led to steady growth for the pot industry. According to market intelligence company BDSA, the U.S. weed industry should enjoy a compound annual growth rate of 11% through 2027. That's $43 billion in potential legal weed sales up for grabs in the U.S. by 2027, and Green Thumb is in pole position to gobble up a significant percentage of it."", 'In December, Green Thumb opened its 90th dispensary, with the company now spanning 15 legalized U.S. states. The thing is, it has dozens of additional licenses in its back pocket to open dispensaries in key markets in the future. It took just five years for Green Thumb to rocket from $22 million in full-year sales to north of $1 billion.', ""But what makes this company so special isn't necessarily its market breadth so much as its product mix. During the September-ended quarter, 44% of net sales came from dried cannabis flower, with the remaining 56% coming from derivatives, which includes things like vapes, edibles, beverages, concentrates, prerolls, and health and beauty products. Derivative pot products boast higher price points and substantially better margins than cannabis flower. This is why Green Thumb has sustained profitability and virtually all other MSOs lose money."", 'The needle continues to point higher for Green Thumb Industries. Wall Street is currently expecting a tenfold increase in earnings per share between 2022 and 2026. If Capitol Hill eventually legalizes adult-use weed, profits could climb even faster.', ""The third amazing growth stock you'll regret not adding to your portfolio with the Nasdaq Composite still below its all-time high is China's No. 2 e-commerce player JD.com (NASDAQ: JD). Even though economic data out of China has disappointed in recent months, there's plenty of reason to believe JD.com is ideally positioned to thrive over the long run."", ""JD and its peers should benefit from the reopening of China's economy following three years of stringent COVID-19 lockdowns. Though regulators ended the zero-COVID mitigation strategy in December 2022, it's going to take time to work out years of kinks in the country's supply chain. With a burgeoning middle class and a history of outpacing the U.S. in the growth department, e-commerce should have a long runway of outsized expansion in China."", ""What makes JD so special is the company's operating model. Although Alibaba reigns supreme from a market share standpoint in China's e-commerce space, JD's operating model gives it far more flexibility. Alibaba generates most of its revenue from third parties using its online marketplace."", 'Meanwhile, JD operates as a true direct-to-consumer retailer. In other words, it handles the inventory and logistics required to get goods to consumers. This gives the company more control over its operating margin.', ""Current and prospective investors should also be excited about the company's plan to spin off its Property and Industrial segments and list them on the Hong Kong stock exchange. Spinoffs make complex businesses easier to understand and usually unlock shareholder value."", ""Lastly, JD.com is cheaper than it's ever been as a publicly traded company. Despite a lengthy track record of double-digit growth, shares can be purchased for a little over 7 times Wall Street's consensus earnings for the company in 2024."", ""A fourth electrifying growth stock you'll regret not buying in the wake of the Nasdaq bear market dip is edge computing company Fastly (NYSE: FSLY). While Fastly's stock was pulverized last week after slightly missing Wall Street's consensus sales estimate for the fourth quarter, the building blocks for success are firmly in place."", ""Fastly is best known for its content delivery network, where it's responsible for moving data from the edge of the cloud to end users as quickly and securely as possible. With businesses shifting their data, and that of their customers, online and into the cloud at an accelerated pace since this decade began, Fastly is staring down a multiyear, if not multidecade, growth opportunity. This is why the company's global network capacity has grown by 58% to 313 terabytes per second since the end of March 2022."", ""Similar to PayPal, optimism with Fastly has a lot to do with the company's key performance indicators moving in the right direction. Average enterprise customer spend hit another all-time high in the fourth quarter at $880,000, with its enterprise customer count jumping to 578. In short, businesses are continuing to gravitate toward Fastly's services."", ""The company's dollar-based net expansion rate (DBNER) has, arguably, been an even more compelling source of optimism. In each of the past eight quarters, DBNER came in between 118% and 123%, including 119% in the December-ended quarter. What this tells investors is that Fastly's customers who've been with the company for at least a year are spending between 18% and 23% more on a year-over-year basis.

Plenty of tech companies have trumpeted the use of AI, but many didn't even exist when International Business Machines (NYSE: IBM) started working on the technology back in the 1950s."", ""IBM's deep expertise in this area allowed the company's AI book of business to double between the third and fourth quarters of last year. This rapid AI growth is one of the reasons why IBM shares jumped to a 52-week high of $197 in January, its highest share price in a decade."", 'The stock price has pulled back from this high, which may make you wonder whether IBM is a buy now. A closer look into Big Blue can help determine if the company makes a good long-term investment.', ""Despite its long history with AI, IBM didn't make this technology a central focus of the company until Arvind Krishna became CEO in 2020. Thanks in part to this prioritization of AI, IBM delivered strong financial performance in 2023."", 'Big Blue ended the fourth quarter with revenue up 4% over 2022, reaching $17.4 billion, as all segments of its business experienced year-over-year sales gains. This propelled IBM to $61.9 billion in full-year revenue.', ""The company's 2023 results were the latest in a trend of steadily rising revenue over the past couple of years."", 'AI was one of the contributing factors to IBM\'s sales growth. Krishna noted, ""Every client I speak with is asking about how to boost productivity with AI.""', ""This is where IBM's consulting division comes into play. Big Blue's consultants help businesses create an AI strategy and implement the technical components. This consultative capability is a competitive advantage."", 'Krishna stated, ""We are the only provider today that offers both a technology stack... and consulting services for deploying and managing generative AI.""', ""As a result, Q4 revenue in IBM's consulting segment was up 6% over 2022, comprising $5 billion of Big Blue's $17.4 billion in sales for the quarter."", ""AI isn't IBM's only area of success. Its Red Hat cloud computing division enjoyed strong 8% year-over-year revenue growth in Q4, and annual bookings increased 17%. This rise in annual bookings indicates customers plan to spend more on Red Hat's cloud computing services, suggesting IBM's Q4 sales success is likely to continue in 2024."", ""Even IBM's infrastructure division, which sells hardware such as computer servers, saw year-over-year sales rise 2.7% in Q4 to $4.6 billion. This business segment is sensitive to product cycle swings, and its latest mainframe server, the z16, has been out for seven quarters."", 'If z16 sales were on the wane, it would be understandable. Instead, the z16 outperformed prior models thanks to innovations such as embedded AI capabilities, as well as cybersecurity capable of protecting from hacks generated by quantum computers. Quantum computing represents the next generation of computing machines, and IBM is developing this technology as well.', 'Helped by its revenue growth, Big Blue saw 2023 free cash flow (FCF) make a substantial jump to $11.2 billion from $9.3 billion in 2022. FCF indicates the cash profits a company has available for activities such as investing in its business and funding its dividend.', ""So IBM's FCF growth is a positive sign for investors, solidifying the company's ability to continue offering its attractive dividend, currently yielding over 3%."", 'Big Blue paid out $6 billion in dividends last year, so its 2023 FCF total comfortably covered this expense, allowing the company to increase its dividend for the 28th straight year. IBM expects to deliver a greater amount of FCF, about $12 billion, in 2024.', ""IBM has a lot going for it right now. It's doing well across all its business segments. Its revenue growth in 2024 looks encouraging given Q4's double-digit increase in annual bookings. FCF generation remains strong, enabling Big Blue the flexibility to raise its dividend."", 'Moreover, the company benefits from the secular trend of AI. The AI market is expected to reach $305.9 billion this year, up from $241.8 billion in 2023, and is forecasted to grow to $738.8 billion by 2030. This serves as a multiyear tailwind for Big Blue.', ""All of these factors combine to make IBM stock an attractive long-term investment. With the share price not far from its 52-week high, a prudent approach is to use dollar-cost averaging to buy some shares now, then build your position over time whenever the stock dips. And you'll receive dividend payments as passive income while you continue to build your position over the long term."", 'Should you invest $1,000 in International Business Machines right now?', 'Before you buy stock in International Business Machines, consider this:', 'The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\xa010 best stocks for investors to buy now… and International Business Machines wasn’t one of them.

KKR as the Bull of the Day and Malibu Boats MBUU as the Bear of the Day. In addition, Zacks Equity Research provides analysis on Dell Technologies DELL, Qualcomm QCOM and IBM IBM.', 'Here is a synopsis of all five stocks:', 'KKR & Co. is a leading global investment firm, with a long and successful history in the private equity industry. KKR & Co. operates a diversified platform across three primary segments: Private Equity, Credit, and Alternative Asset Management.', 'Over the last ten years these businesses have been booming, and KKR has executed the strategies with some of the best returns across the industry. Such success has led to annualized returns of 34% over the last five years, considerably outperforming many of its competitors and the broad market.', 'For the average retail investor, access to private equity, credit and alternative investment opportunities are extremely limited. But with KKR now trading as a public company, any investor can get access to these powerful opportunities.', 'Additionally, KKR & Co. currently enjoys a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) rating, further increasing the odds of a near-term rally in the share price.', ""Here, I will highlight several further bullish factors powering KKR stock and share why it makes for a worthy consideration in many investors' portfolios."", ""The proprietary methodology used at Zacks is one of the most powerful techniques there is for picking stocks as it aggregates the earnings estimates of all analysts' forecasts. The strategy has been quantitatively tested and shows strong market outperformance over the long term."", 'KKR & Co. boasts the highest Zacks Rank, with nearly all analysts covering the stock upgrading the EPS outlook over the last two months.', 'Current quarter earnings estimates have increased by 9.5% over the last two months and are expected to climb 42% YoY to $1.15 per share. FY24 earnings estimates have been boosted by 3.6% and are projected to jump 43.3% YoY to $4.90 per share.', ""KKR's topline is set to expand nicely over the next two years as well, with sales forecast to grow 17.9% this year and 18.2% next year."", ""KKR is trading at a one year forward earnings multiple of 21.7x, which is about in line with the broad market. However, because of KKR's exceptional EPS growth estimates, the stock is potentially undervalued."", 'EPS at the asset manager are forecast to grow 25% annually over the next 3-5 years. Not only is this an impressive growth rate, but because its below the forward earnings multiple it means its PEG Ratio is below 1x, indicating undervalued status based on the metric.', 'KKR currently has a PEG Ratio of 0.86x.', ""Private equity and KKR's other businesses are very strong business models and are executed at the highest level. This means investors can now access these strategies as easily as buying an ETF."", 'The advantages of these strategies are numerous as well. Private equity is known for offering lower volatility than public markets, potentially higher returns, and uses active management to identify the best business opportunities.', 'Furthermore, Credit and Alternative Assets offer additional diversification from equities. Credit provides regular income through lending, and Alternatives give exposure to projects like infrastructure.', 'KKR & Co. is trading at an appealing valuation, with a powerful business model, and upward trending earnings revisions. Because of these multitude of bullish catalysts, I think investors can consider investing in KKR at current levels.', 'Malibu Boats, a leading designer and manufacturer of sport boats, is bumping into some considerable slowdowns in top and bottom-line expectations, giving it a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) rating.', 'The bout of consumer exuberance which followed the Covid-19 lockdown pulled forward considerable buying of large-ticket items like boats. Because of this, sales at Malibu Boats jumped well above trend and while it was welcome at the time, is limiting sales over the next year or two.', 'As buying a boat is not something that is done regularly, the company is likely to see a slowdown in growth moving forward and should be avoided for now.', 'The dynamic troubling Malibu Boats has not been missed by analysts, as they have unanimously lowered earnings estimates for the company. Current quarter sales have been revised lower by -53% over the last two months and are projected to fall -71% YoY to just $0.77 per share. FY24 earnings estimates have been lowered by -37% and are expected to fall -43% YoY.', 'Top-line growth is expected to tank in the coming year. Current quarter sales are expected to decline -39% YoY to $228 million and FY24 by -32% to $940 million.', 'It seems every time I come back to this stock both sales and earnings estimates have been revised lower.', 'What concerns me further is that even with the falling top and bottom line, Malibu Boats still has a historically premium valuation. With a one year forward earnings multiple of 14.9x, it is almost 50% above its five-year median of 9.9x.', 'While Malibu Boats is experiencing near-term challenges, the stock is by no means a zero. However, based on the current setup, I think investors should seek out other opportunities in the market.', ""Technology's momentum is undeniably attractive to investors, with the high-flying sector delivering notable gains and boosting sentiment over the last year. In fact, the Zacks Computer and Technology sector has gained nearly 48% over the period compared to the S&P 500's impressive 25% gain."", 'Investors also love dividends, as they provide a nice buffer against drawdowns and provide a passive income stream, undoubtedly a solid pairing. And for those seeking exposure to both technology and dividends, three stocks – Dell Technologies, Qualcomm and IBM– fit the criteria nicely.', ""On top of rewarding shareholders with quarterly payouts, all three sport a favorable Zacks Rank, reflecting optimism among analysts. Let's take a closer look at each."", 'Dell Technologies', ""Dell Technologies, a current Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), provides information technology solutions. The company's shares currently yield 1.7% annually paired with a sustainable payout ratio sitting at 26% of its earnings."", 'The outlook for its current fiscal year has been notably positive, with the $6.66 Zacks Consensus EPS estimate up 8% over the last year. Better-than-expected quarterly results over the last year have helped drive share performance, with DELL exceeding the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate by an average of 36% across its last four releases.', ""It's worth noting that the company's growth is expected to cool in its current fiscal year (FY24), with consensus expectations alluding to a 12% pullback in earnings on 13% lower sales."", 'Qualcomm', 'Qualcomm, a current Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), designs, manufactures, and markets digital wireless telecom products and services based on the Code Division Multiple Access (CDMA) technology. Analysts have bumped their earnings expectations higher across the board.', 'QCOM shares pay investors nicely, currently yielding 2.1% annually. The company has shown a commitment to increasingly rewarding shareholders, as reflected by its 6.3% five-year annualized dividend growth rate.', ""The company's latest set of quarterly results came in above expectations, posting a 15% beat relative to the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate and reporting sales 4.5% ahead of the consensus. Headline numbers exceeded the high end of prior guidance, with the company also returning $1.7 billion to shareholders through buybacks and dividend payouts."", 'IBM', 'IBM, a current Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), is an information technology (IT) company. Analysts have moved their earnings expectations higher across the board over the last several months. Shares presently yield 3.6% annually, crushing the Zacks Computer and Technology sector average of 0.6%.', ""IBM's latest set of quarterly results came in above expectations, with Software sales climbing 8% year-over-year as customers increasingly adopt its watsonx AI and data platform. Cash-generating abilities also saw a notable boost, with operating cash flow of $3.1 billion well higher than the $1.9 billion mark in the year-ago period."", 'IBM shares have moved higher post-earnings in back-to-back releases.', ""Dividend-paying stocks don't always have to be 'boring,' as many exciting companies from the technology sector also reward their shareholders with payouts."", 'And for those interested in gaining exposure to the sector paired with quarterly payouts, all three stocks above fit the criteria nicely.', 'On top of quarterly payouts, all three currently sport a favorable Zacks Rank, reflecting positive outlooks among analysts.', ""Why Haven't You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?

Pras, what kind of deals are we talking about?"", ""PRAS SUBRAMANIAN: Akiko, this kind of thing occurred to me as I saw stats like the KBB study you mentioned-- seeing this imbalance in the marketplace, where so many automakers pushed so deeply into the EV narrative, and then now they're seeing that the fact that they have supply building up on the showroom floor."", ""So, first and foremost, I'm looking at some of the cheaper, more entry-level EVs. And one that crossed my scanner here is the Hyundai Ioniq 5. This is a great-looking, well-featured crossover/hatchback."", ""And right now, it starts at a pretty decent price of $41,800. But now, Hyundai is offering $7,500 in cash back and also 0.99% financing for 48 months. I think that's a great deal."", 'And when you step up to the next level, you got to go Tesla Model Y. Look, Elon Musk antics aside, this is a great entry-level-- well, not actually-- but like a mid-size. You can get it in three-row format. But this is just a great car in terms of just the feature set, the size and also the charging infrastructure.', ""I know, Akiko, you've had experience with Tesla as well."", 'AKIKO FUJITA: Yeah, Teslas are good cars. I am currently driving an ID.4 Volkswagen right now.', ""But I'm looking at the average price has hovered around, what, $50,000, maybe a little more, in terms of EVs. What are you hearing is the sweet spot? In other words, these discounts that are coming through, what's the level they need to get to entice drivers to make the switch, despite infrastructure, despite everything else?"", ""PRAS SUBRAMANIAN: Yeah, prices were usually-- I mean, not usually-- they usually were in the 60s level for a while now, and they sort of came down now to the 50s. I think that there's more and more cars that are in the $30,000 to $40,000 range, like I mentioned the Hyundai Ioniq 5. But I think that below, that sub-30, is where you're really going to see a whole mass of people."", ""I think that there's people out there that just can't afford them, and Elon Musk has said the same thing. And if you give them the right feature set, the right price, they're going to be OK with the fact that they might not have the best range or might not have the best charging infrastructure."", ""You mentioned that price set. I think one other feature, one other size format, that people are very excited about, are the three-row EVs. And that's where the Kia EV9 comes into play. This is a very good-looking three-row SUV. It gets good range. And it's in that mid-50s price range that you mentioned that's where the average of EVs are."", 'And the thing is, right now, Kia is offering $3,750 off that car for now and 3.25% financing for 48 months. So there is a deal to be had there for a very, very popular car format in the US.', ""AKIKO FUJITA: Yeah, those Korean carmakers are really making a push with that competitive pricing out there. It's going to be interesting to see how the market share starts to shift up as a result."", 'Pras Subramanian, thanks so much for that.', 'PRAS SUBRAMANIAN: Thank you.']"

But sometimes appearances can be deceiving. A stock that has skyrocketed can end up being a loser over the long run. A stock that has plummeted can turn around and deliver huge long-term gains.', ""I think Target (NYSE: TGT) is an example of a winner in the latter category. Here's why I just bought this underperforming Dividend King."", ""Target's share price has fallen 16% over the last 12 months. That's especially dismal considering that the S&P 500 has soared 20% higher during this period."", ""Why has Target stock lagged the market so much? The giant retailer's sales have been weaker than expected. In the third quarter of 2023, same-store sales fell 4.9% year over year. High inflation has taken a toll on consumer spending, especially on discretionary goods."", ""However, Target has a better story than its stock performance reflects. Despite the external headwinds, the company has made smart moves to increase its profitability. While sales were disappointing in Q3, Target's earnings per share jumped 36% year over year -- well above the high end of the company's guidance range."", ""If we look at just the last three months, Target's shares have handily outgained the S&P 500. Inflation is moderating, although it's still not as low as anyone would like. The U.S. economy is also proving to be surprisingly resilient."", ""One part of Target's investment thesis remains highly appealing. The company's dividend yield currently tops 3%, near the upper end of its range over the last five years."", ""Target has paid a dividend every quarter since its IPO in October 1967. That's 226 quarters (56.5 years) of dividends. Even more impressive, the retailer has increased its dividend for 52 consecutive years."", ""What I especially like is how fast Target's dividend has grown. Since early 2021, the company's dividend payout has increased by nearly 62%. That translates into a compound annual growth rate of more than 17%."", 'To be sure, the most recent dividend increase was much smaller. However, Target appears to be in a good position to keep raising its dividends going forward, with a dividend payout ratio of around 55%.', 'Go to any of Target\'s nearly 2,000 stores, and you\'ll probably see the company\'s slogan, ""Expect More. Pay Less."" I think those four words succinctly sum up my rationale for buying the stock right now.', 'I expect more from Target than what it has delivered in the recent past. Most of the challenges that the company faces are beyond its control, such as high inflation. The good news, though, is that the macroeconomic environment is improving. The even better news is that Target has successfully navigated difficult times in the past and appears to be doing so again.', 'Target\'s same-day fulfillment, especially its curbside pickup program, continues to gain momentum. The company\'s partnerships with Starbucks, Disney, and Ulta Beauty\xa0for ""stores within stores"" should help attract customers.', 'I expect more dividends, too. Target\'s management realizes how important the company\'s dividend track record is to investors. It\'s not surprising that CFO Michael Fiddelke emphasized in the Q3 earnings call that one of Target\'s top capital deployment priorities is to ""support the dividend and build on our record of annual increases.""', ""What about paying less? Target's shares currently trade less than 16 times forward earnings. By comparison, the S&P 500's forward earnings multiple is nearly 20.7. The consumer staples sector's average forward earnings multiple is 19.7. Target's valuation looks attractive, in my view."", ""The bottom line for me is that Target remains a winner.

Put off by rising costs due to inflation, customers have embraced store-brand “dupes” to save cash. Over half of shoppers surveyed by the Food Industry Association in October said they planned to buy private-label grocery brands, such as Target’s Good & Gather or Costco’s Kirkland Signature.', '""We know that value is top of mind for consumers, and dealworthy, backed by our owned brand promise, will not only appeal to our current guests but position us to attract even more new shoppers to Target,” said Rick Gomez, Target’s executive vice president and chief food, essentials, and beauty officer, in a press release.', 'The pressure is on for Target to keep pace with other low-cost competitors. While Walmart has seen steady share price increases over the past five years, Target’s stock has ebbed and flowed.', ""Target relies heavily on its own-brand products, which have become increasingly important as inflation-induced cost hikes have scared customers away from spending. In 2022, $30 billion of Target's sales came from own-brand products, a huge chunk of its $109 billion in revenue.

Target could also be eyeing dollar-store customers, particularly after Dollar Tree raised prices above $1.', 'But Marshall Fisher, professor of operations, information, and decisions at Wharton, warned that Target’s new budget brand could appear more like a cry for help than a deliberate act to help customers.', ""“Producing a bundle of 400 low-cost products could be viewed as a Hail Mary, like they're desperate,” Fisher told Fortune."", 'For years, Target’s strategic position has been cheap-chic, relying on higher-quality products at slightly higher prices to draw in customers. The retailer committed to the philosophy decades ago amidst slowing sales, and stuck to that ethos for years to successfully launch exclusive brands.', 'Fisher is dubious that emulating Walmart’s rock-bottom pricing will be effective. It’s just hard to beat Walmart’s prices.', '“Pick a few items at Target versus Walmart. What would a basket cost at Walmart versus Target?” Fisher said. “I bet you Walmart is going to come out cheaper.”', 'But beyond cheap prices, Walmart tapped into the online grocery market, a service appealing to wealthier shoppers looking for convenience, more effectively than Target. Walmart captured over one-third of online grocery sales in 2023’s second quarter, and its e-commerce business grew 24% from 2022. The retailer crushed Amazon in online grocery sales last year and is expected to continue to do so.', 'Target has been slow to react. The company has been toying with launching a paid membership comparable to Amazon Prime or Walmart+, but has not announced any official plans for the initiative, Bloomberg reported earlier this month.', 'The yet-to-be-launched service, referred to internally as Project Trident, would reportedly use the grocery delivery business Shipt, which Target bought in 2017. Target has a free loyalty service called Target Circle, which offers rewards and promotions to members, but the paid membership would offer services beyond this.', 'Right now, Target is trying to be “everything to everyone,” Fisher warns, as the company weighs its options for luring back customers from competitors.', ""“Target has to decide who they're competing with,” he said."", 'This story was originally featured on Fortune.com']"

The stock has made an impressive rebound since then and is currently trading at its 52-week high, outperforming the market since the start of January 2024 (+8.9% vs. +5.3%).', 'It will be interesting to see if this performance momentum can be sustained following fresh quarterly results on Tuesday, February 20th.

The sector is currently expected to bring in 28.6% of the index’s total earnings over the coming four-quarter period, with the second and third biggest contributors in Finance and Medical at 17.8% and 12.5%, respectively.', 'This means that the Tech sector’s growth profile has a very big impact on the aggregate picture, both negatively and positively.

Fans may not realize that once upon a time, Visa was the credit card arm of Bank of America, and it was spun off with its own initial public offering (IPO) in 2008. Since then, it's had a fabulous run, gaining more than six times the S&P 500's gains in the same time period."", 'Visa currently has a market cap of $560 billion. To join the trillion-dollar market cap club, it would almost need to double. Can it do that over the next decade or so?', 'Visa processes more payment volume than any other credit card network. It processed more than $15 trillion over the trailing 12 months and has relationships with more than 14,500 financial institutions worldwide. That means it has access to more customers, and it powers 4.3 million cards globally. Every time a customer swipes a card, Visa takes a fee.', ""In general, as it benefits from shopping and payment trends, Visa's performance mirrors the economy. However, despite volatility in the economy over the past few years, Visa has been demonstrating solid growth."", ""In fiscal 2023, revenue increased 11% over last year, while payments volume increased 9%. In the 2024 fiscal first quarter (ended Dec. 31, 2023), revenue was up 9%, and payments volume increased 8%. Part of that is due to how widespread Visa is, but there's more."", ""There's so much financial technology out there today, and Visa is taking a leading role in developing digital financial infrastructure to maintain its dominant position in its industry. These actions are cementing Visa's powerhouse role in shopping and payments and paving its future roadway."", 'Visa now has three segments that work together: Its core payments business, new flows, and value-added services.', ""The core payments business is the credit card network that connects a customer's financial institution with a merchant client. When you shop, Visa is the gateway for your bank to transfer funds to the store. That's why Visa credit cards are co-branded with an issuing bank that approves the customer for the credit card."", ""New flows are other payment options that Visa enables, such as Visa Direct, a global digital payments network. One example is Visa's new partnership with Meta that allows content creators to send earnings straight to a Visa debit card. New flows are one of Visa's highest-growing segments, up 20% year over year in the 2024 fiscal first quarter."", 'Value-added services are other services Visa offers, such as data analytics for merchant clients. In order to provide an expanded set of services, Visa has been acquiring global payment networks, such as its recent acquisitions of digital network Pismo and Mexico-based Prosa.', ""To reach a market cap of $1 trillion, assuming its price-to-earnings ratio remains stable at 32, net income would have to increase from $18 billion today to reach $31 billion. That implies a compound annual growth rate of only 5%. Net income increased 15% in 2023 with a CAGR of 21.5% over the past 11 years, so that seems more than doable. Of course, if the price-to-earnings ratio changes, that equation will change, too. But Visa's valuation has remained relatively stable over the past 10 years, with an average price-to-earnings ratio of 34."", 'The likelier scenario is that Visa will become a trillion-dollar stock much sooner than 2035, implying that its stock will double much faster as well. It has many growth drivers and increasing profits, and investors can be confident about its ability to keep its top spot in payments. It also pays a dividend.

GuruFocus has detected 6 Warning Signs with DKNG.', ""On February 16, 2024, Snap-on Inc (NYSE:SNA) filed its annual 10-K report, revealing the financial and operational nuances of the company's performance. As a leading innovator and manufacturer of tools, equipment, diagnostics, and systems solutions, Snap-on Inc has established a strong presence in the professional repair industry. The company's financial tables from the 10-K filing indicate a sustained commitment to growth and efficiency, with a notable increase in net sales across its diverse product groups. This SWOT analysis aims to dissect the intricate details of Snap-on Inc's operations, providing investors with a comprehensive understanding of the company's strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats."", ""Brand Recognition and Market Presence: Snap-on Inc's brand is synonymous with quality and reliability, a reputation built over a century of operation. The company's extensive product range, including hand tools, power tools, and diagnostic equipment, is a testament to its commitment to innovation and customer satisfaction. Snap-on Inc's unique business model, which leverages franchisee-operated mobile vans, ensures a direct and personal connection with auto technicians, fostering loyalty and repeat business. This approach has not only solidified Snap-on Inc's market position but also created a competitive moat that is difficult for new entrants to penetrate."", 'Financial Services Arm: The financial arm of Snap-on Inc provides a strategic advantage by offering financing to franchisees for their operations. This includes loans and leases for mobile vans, which are essential for the franchisees to conduct their business effectively. By supporting its franchise network in this manner, Snap-on Inc ensures a stable and consistent distribution channel for its products, which in turn drives sales and reinforces brand loyalty among end-users.', ""Franchisee Dependence: While the franchise model is a strength, it also presents a vulnerability. Snap-on Inc's success is heavily reliant on the performance of its franchisees. If franchisees struggle, whether due to economic downturns, poor management, or other factors, Snap-on Inc's revenue and market presence could suffer. This dependence places an additional burden on the company to continuously support and monitor the health of its franchise network."", ""Global Economic Sensitivity: Snap-on Inc's operations are subject to the whims of the global economy, including fluctuations in raw material costs, energy prices, and currency exchange rates. The 10-K filing highlights concerns such as the impact of tariffs, trade sanctions, and supply chain inefficiencies, all of which can adversely affect profitability. Additionally, the company must navigate the complexities of international trade, including the effects of Brexit and other geopolitical events."", 'Technological Advancements: The automotive industry is rapidly evolving with the rise of electric and hybrid vehicles. Snap-on Inc has the opportunity to leverage its R&D capabilities to develop new tools and diagnostic solutions tailored to these advanced vehicles. By staying at the forefront of technological innovation, Snap-on Inc can capture new market segments and maintain its relevance in a changing industry landscape.', 'Emerging Markets: Snap-on Inc has the potential to expand its footprint in emerging markets, where vehicle ownership and the need for professional repair services are on the rise. By tapping into these new markets, Snap-on Inc can diversify its revenue streams and reduce its dependence on mature markets, where growth may be more stagnant.', 'Intense Competition: The tool manufacturing industry is highly competitive, with numerous players vying for market share. Snap-on Inc faces the challenge of maintaining its premium pricing strategy in the face of aggressive competition. The company must continuously innovate and deliver superior value to justify its price points and retain its customer base.', ""Supply Chain Risks: As highlighted in the 10-K filing, Snap-on Inc is vulnerable to supply chain disruptions, which can arise from natural disasters, climate-related events, or geopolitical conflicts such as the war in Ukraine. These disruptions can lead to production delays, increased costs, and ultimately impact the company's ability to meet customer demand in a timely manner."", ""In conclusion, Snap-on Inc (NYSE:SNA) exhibits a robust set of strengths, including a strong brand and a supportive financial services arm, which have positioned it as a leader in the tool manufacturing industry. However, the company must navigate weaknesses such as its dependence on franchisee success and sensitivity to global economic conditions. Opportunities for growth exist in technological advancements and emerging markets, but these are tempered by threats from intense competition and potential supply chain disruptions. Investors should weigh these factors carefully when considering Snap-on Inc's prospects for sustained growth and profitability."", 'This article, generated by GuruFocus, is designed to provide general insights and is not tailored financial advice.

But which is the better buy? Here's the lowdown."", ""It's worth noting that both these stocks contain significant near-term risks.

That marks a whopping gain of 1,810% in just five years. Nvidia's historic run was fueled by the rapid growth of the artificial intelligence (AI) market, which sparked brisk sales of its high-end data center GPUs for processing AI tasks."", ""Nvidia's multibagger gains are impressive, but could Broadcom (NASDAQ: AVGO) -- which rallied nearly 350% over the past five years and is worth about $590 billion -- follow its lead and become the next hot chipmaker by the end of the decade?"", 'Broadcom is a more diversified company than Nvidia. Its chipmaking business produces a wide range of wireless, networking, optical, data storage, and industrial chips. Its software segment provides infrastructure, cloud, and cybersecurity services.', 'In fiscal 2023 (which ended last November), Broadcom generated 79% of its revenue from its chipmaking business and 21% from its software division. It also generated a fifth of its total revenue from Apple, which holds a multiyear agreement to purchase its wireless, radio frequency, and mobile chips.', ""Broadcom might seem too dependent on the cyclical chipmaking market and Apple's orders, but it expects its recent acquisition of cloud giant VMware to expand its software segment to account for about half of its top line. Like Nvidia, Broadcom also expects the secular expansion of the generative AI market -- which was responsible for 20% of its semiconductor revenue in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023 -- to fuel its long-term growth."", 'Nvidia\'s business model is simpler than Broadcom\'s. In its latest quarter, it generated 80% of its revenue from its high-growth data center division. Its gaming GPU business accounted for 16% of its revenue, while 4% came from professional visualization, automotive, and OEM chips. Nvidia develops higher-end chips than Broadcom, but they\'re both ""fabless"" chipmakers that outsource their production to third-party foundries like Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing.', ""Today's Broadcom was actually called Avago Technologies until 2016. That's the year Avago acquired the original Broadcom and inherited its more well-established brand."", 'Before buying Broadcom, Avago repeatedly grew through big acquisitions. As the ""new"" Broadcom, it continued to expand inorganically by buying CA Technologies, Symantec\'s enterprise security unit, and VMware to construct its software business.', ""Broadcom's organic growth and ongoing acquisitions enabled it to increase its annual revenue at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 15% from fiscal 2016 to fiscal 2023. Its adjusted earnings per share (EPS) rose at a CAGR of 21%. From fiscal 2023 to fiscal 2026, analysts expect its revenue and earnings to climb at CAGRs of 19% and 18%, respectively, as it integrates VMware and continues to expand its chipmaking and software divisions."", 'By comparison, Nvidia grew its revenue and adjusted EPS at a faster CAGR of 21% and 23%, respectively, from fiscal 2017 to fiscal 2023 (which ended last January). From fiscal 2023 to fiscal 2026, analysts expect its revenue and earnings to increase at a CAGR of 61% and 133%, respectively, as the AI market continues to expand.', 'We should take all of those estimates with a grain of salt, but Nvidia should grow much faster than Broadcom for the foreseeable future. Broadcom also seems more dedicated to generating stable double-digit revenue and earnings growth from its diversified portfolio instead of chasing breakneck expansion from a smaller selection of chips like Nvidia.', ""That said, Broadcom could still become a trillion-dollar chipmaker by the end of the decade if it simply maintains its current valuation and growth rates. Its stock looks reasonably valued today at just 27 times forward earnings -- and if it maintains that multiple, matches analysts' estimates, and increases its earnings at a stable CAGR of 15% from fiscal 2026 to fiscal 2030, its market cap could easily exceed $1.2 trillion by the final year."", ""Therefore, Broadcom might not ever attract as much attention as Nvidia, but it's still one of the few promising chipmakers that has a shot at following Nvidia's lead into the four-comma club."", 'Should you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:', 'The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\xa010 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

There are multiple ways to invest in the trend, from hardware to software to application plays. Each of these segments has advantages and drawbacks. Still, two of the most popular ways to invest in AI from the hardware and software perspective are Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) and Palantir (NYSE: PLTR), respectively.', ""But of these two, which is the better buy? Let's find out."", ""Nvidia's GPUs (graphics processing units) are the building blocks of AI computing. GPUs are great at processing complex computing loads like training an AI model. With Nvidia's GPUs often perceived as best-in-class, it has become the go-to company for GPUs slated for AI use."", ""Palantir's software was originally designed for the government to take in loads of data and deliver actionable insights. Its software has since expanded to commercial use, although government revenue still makes up most of its business. Palantir's software is highly adaptable and can be tailored to meet a variety of needs, whether it's a hospital, insurance, or manufacturing company."", 'The two markets these two serve are completely different, as are the rest of their attributes.', ""Because Nvidia is a hardware company, its revenue stream isn't recurring. It needs to sell additional GPUs to grow its business, and if the demand isn't there, then Nvidia's revenue could suffer."", ""Palantir's software model requires its customers to renew within a predetermined time frame (often annual or monthly), and clients must pay a fee to continue using Palantir's product."", ""So, if a recession strikes, Nvidia's revenue streams will likely come under pressure as customers may choose to delay some of its projects. Conversely, if Palantir's software is highly integrated into a client's systems, they likely have no choice but to continue paying Palantir."", 'Winner: Palantir', ""When considering outright growth, Nvidia is far superior to Palantir. In the third quarter of fiscal year 2024 (ended Oct. 30), Nvidia's revenue rose 206% year over year compared to Palantir's fourth quarter of fiscal year 2023 (ended Dec. 31) growth of 20%."", ""While Nvidia's growth far outpaces Palalntir's, Palantir is still growing at a respectable rate for a software company."", 'Winner: Nvidia ', 'Unlike many growth companies, Palantir knows how to turn a profit. In Q4, it posted a 15% profit margin.', ""Palantir's profit margins have steadily risen over the past few years, and it isn't done yet. However, Nvidia's profit margins are far superior to Palantir's since it is a mature business."", ""If Nvidia goes through another downturn due to demand depletion, don't be surprised if Nvidia's margins drop below Palantir's. But for right now, Nvidia is far ahead of Palantir in this measure."", 'Winner: Nvidia', ""Because Palantir hasn't reached maximum profitability, using a valuation measure like a price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio is problematic, so a revenue-based measure like the price-to-sales (P/S) ratio is often used. Likewise, a mature company like Nvidia shouldn't be using the P/S ratio; instead, it should use the P/E ratio."", ""As a result, comparing these two head-to-head is difficult. So, we'll have to compare them to their peers."", ""At 25 times sales, Palantir is a very expensive stock. But it's not in unprecedented territory. Peers like CrowdStrike, Snowflake, and Cloudflare all trade in this range, but their revenue growth rates are in the 30% year-over-year range instead of 20% for Palantir. As a result, Palantir can be considered as an incredibly expensive stock."", ""Nvidia's price-to-earnings ratio hasn't improved, as it trades for nearly 100 times earnings. But when forward earnings are utilized (which factor in the next 12 months of growth), Nvidia's stock doesn't look as expensive, as it trades for 35 times forward earnings. With peers like Microsoft and Apple trading at 35 and 28 times forward earnings, Nvidia's price tag doesn't look as bad, especially when its warp-speed growth rate is considered."", 'With Nvidia being more closely valued by its peers than Palantir, it wins this round.', 'Winner: Nvidia', 'At a final score of three to one, Nvidia beats out Palantir.

Poring over the recent financial results, discerning the addressable market, and understanding where the company fits into the overall ecosystem are all puzzle pieces that help provide insight into the company's future."", 'It\'s that last piece that I got wrong when I first read up on Arm Holdings (NASDAQ: ARM) late last year. I fully understood the company\'s dominance in providing central processing units (CPUs) to the smartphone industry but didn\'t make the connection to how Arm would benefit from the tidal wave of demand in the field of generative artificial intelligence (AI). At the time, I wrote, ""Arm Holdings is trying to cast itself as the next Nvidia -- but wishing doesn\'t make it so.""', ""Let's take a look at the company, how I got it wrong, and what I believe it means for investors now."", ""In order to fully appreciate the opportunity at hand, it's important to understand how Arm makes money. In its simplest form, the company creates the blueprints from which many of the world's most popular CPUs are built. These designs form the intellectual property (IP) that drives Arm's growth."", 'The vast majority of the company\'s revenue comes from the licensing and royalties it receives from other businesses paying to use its designs. These processors are found in virtually every area of technology, including smartphones, tablets, personal computers, and smart TVs, as well as cloud computing, hyperscale computing, and data centers. Arm\'s technology can also be found in smartwatches, thermostats, drones, and automobiles. The company notes that it controls a ""significant proportion of all chips with embedded processors.""', 'The licensing segment provides licenses to use specific products and applications for a specified period of time. Because Arm licenses its technology to many companies, that gives it economies of scale -- meaning it can license its designs at a cost that is lower than if these companies attempted to develop the same technology internally. In addition to licensing these designs, Arm is also paid a royalty, which can be a percentage of the average selling price (ASP) for each chip sold or a flat fee per unit.', 'Arm works hand-in-hand with its biggest customers, ensuring the chip designs meet exacting specifications, as these agreements historically extend for years and to multiple generations of future chips.', 'When Arm first announced it was going public, I pored over the regulatory filings, looking to understand its edge. One statement stood out: ""The CPU is vital in all AI systems, whether it is handling the AI workload entirely or in combination with a co-processor, such as a GPU or ... [neural processing unit]."" As I noted at the time, ""This ignores the fact that the GPU does much of the heavy lifting, and there are plenty of CPU peddlers out there.""', ""And that's where I got it wrong. Not fully understanding the pervasive nature of Arm's IP -- which is used by 70% of the world's population, according to the company -- I concluded that Arm would likely be an also-ran when it came to AI. Boy, was I wrong."", ""In a recent interview, CEO Rene Haas laid out the opportunity, and it was eye-opening. The current proliferation of AI has had a dramatic effect on the demand for Arm's higher-end processor designs. For example, Haas cited Nvidia's (NASDAQ: NVDA) GH200 Grace Hopper Superchip -- which marries accelerated CPU and GPU technology to meet the needs of AI -- and uses a whopping 144 Arm version 9 (V9) CPU cores. It isn't just Nvidia that's loading up on Arm's latest processor designs. Microsoft's (NASDAQ: MSFT) new AI server chips use more than 100 V9 processors. And that's just two examples out of a multitude."", ""There's more. Haas noted that many of its existing customers are shifting to the V9, which offers greater computing power and boasts twice the royalty rate of its predecessor, further boosting Arm's fortunes. Smartphones, for example, will need to handle a certain amount of AI processing on the device, increasing the number of processing cores necessary and bolstering demand for higher-end CPUs."", 'Haas said companies are looking to ""future-proof"" their smartphones and other devices and are building in additional computing power to handle the rigorous demands of AI. Expand that beyond smartphones to connected TVs, smart doorbells, smart appliances, and automobiles, and the magnitude of the opportunity comes into view.', 'Nobody likes to eat crow, but I sure got Arm Holdings wrong. That became apparent when the company reported its recent financial results.', 'For its fiscal 2024 third quarter, Arm generated record revenue of $824 million, up 14% year over year, driven by license revenue that grew 18% while record royalty revenue climbed 11%. This pushed adjusted earnings per share (EPS) to $0.29, good for an increase of 32%.', ""However, it's Arm's remaining performance obligation (RPO) -- which includes contractually obligated revenue that hasn't yet been recognized -- that really shines a light on the company's future growth potential. In the third quarter, RPO climbed to $2.43 billion, up 38% year over year."", ""Management expects the company's accelerating growth to continue. In the fourth quarter, Arm's forecast calls for revenue in a range of $850 million to $900 million, which would be a 38% increase at the midpoint -- well ahead of the third quarter's 14% gain."", ""As a result of Arm's growth spurt, the valuation may appear stretched by some measures -- but not all. While the shares are currently selling for 1,677 times earnings and 44 times sales (as of this writing), that fails to take into account the company's projected growth. When measured in terms of Arm's forward price/earnings-to-growth (PEG) ratio, its reveals a valuation of less than 1 -- the standard for an undervalued stock."", ""Now that I have a better understanding of the company's potential, I plan to buy shares as soon as The Motley Fool's trading rules allow.

The company's top segment, Google Search, started using machine learning and AI capabilities as far back as 2001 to help users improve spelling when making search queries. There's no doubt that this focus helped make Alphabet the dominant company that it is today."", ""Google Search is arguably the single most important internet-based service in the world, mainly because it has become a gateway for users to find information. And its success is still critical to Alphabet today, as Search raked in $48 billion of revenue in the fourth quarter of 2023, representing 56% of the company's total."", 'CEO Sundar Pichai claimed in a 2016 blog post that Alphabet was no longer a mobile-first enterprise, but ""AI-first"" from that point forward. This meant creating ""a world where computing becomes universally available.""', ""I'd say the business has been successful in this regard. Many of Alphabet's products already incorporate AI. Gmail uses AI not only to help with spell check, but by also reducing spam. Google Cloud continues to integrate AI functionality into the various tools it offers clients, so that they can benefit from this revolutionary technology. And -- what I believe is an extremely neat feature -- Google Photos allows users to find an image they're looking for by searching what's in the picture. These are just a few examples."", ""Ten years from now, I have a lot of confidence that Alphabet will not only remain a leader in AI, but that it could also separate itself from other top companies in the space. It all has to do with Alphabet's data advantage."", ""Fifteen of the company's products and services are used by more than 500 million people across the globe. In fact, google.com and youtube.com are the two most visited websites on the planet. Consequently, I'd be surprised if there's another business that collects more data than Alphabet."", ""And this means the company can constantly train its AI systems to improve. This leads to a positive feedback loop where more data means better AI models, which results in improved customer experiences and greater usage, leading to even more data collection. That's a powerful advantage for Alphabet."", ""It's probably no wonder that the company's latest generative AI model, Gemini, beats ChatGPT in numerous performance areas."", 'Besides the topic of AI, Alphabet makes for a smart investment because its shares are attractively priced. The FAANG stock trades at a price-to-earnings (P/E) multiple of 25.6.', ""Nvidia, on the other hand, sells for a P/E ratio of 97.2. To be fair, the chipmaker is registering monster growth. But it looks like investors are pricing in the belief that growth at this rate can go on indefinitely.

Welcome to our fourth quarter and full year 2023 earnings conference call. We are pleased to report that Genuine Parts Company delivered on our financial commitments in 2023 and finished the year with a solid fourth quarter. Will and Bert will cover our results in more detail, but I'd like to share a few highlights. During 2023, total GPC sales topped $23 billion, an increase of nearly $1 billion from the prior year and in line with our expectations. We improved our total company segment profit margins by 50 basis points to nearly double digits, and we had our third consecutive year of double-digit earnings growth. And notably, we returned $788 million to our shareholders this year and today, we announced that our Board approved a 68th consecutive annual increase to the dividend."", 'Our teams around the globe delivered a strong performance while remaining focused on our long-term strategic initiatives to profitably grow our business and deliver value for our customers. I want to take this opportunity to thank our more than 60,000 GPC teammates across the world for their dedication and hard work. Our fourth quarter and full year results again demonstrate the value of our complementary business mix paired with our geographic diversity. At our Investor Day back in March of 2023, we showcased our strategic initiatives and announced long-term financial targets for the first time in our history, all focused on delivering for our customers and delivering shareholder value. Clearly, this past year had its share of challenges and opportunities, but our performance in 2023 was a good start to achieve our three-year goals highlighted by the following.', ""Our Motion team completed the integration of Kaman Distribution Group, and we exceeded our synergy target a full year ahead of plan. As an integrated business, Motion is a clear leader in their space, providing industrial aftermarket solutions with a compelling value proposition to more than 200,000 customers around the world. In addition, during 2023, Motion continued to roll out their fulfillment center strategy, which is driving cost efficiencies, inventory productivity and improved customer service levels. During the fourth quarter, I had a chance to visit our fulfillment center in Lakeland, Florida, and I can't say enough positive things about the team and their dedication to serving our customers. We're excited about the rollout of these facilities in 2024 and 2025."", ""Within Automotive, our International Automotive businesses outperformed our expectations in 2023. Our European team continues to expand their presence and gained market share through both strategic acquisitions and organic growth. In 2023, we expanded our presence in Spain, Europe's fifth largest car park with the acquisition of Gaudi, securing our position as the leader in this strategic market. And finally, the rollout of NAPA branded product in the European market has continued to surpass our expectations, a testament to the strength of the NAPA brand. In Australasia, our team is profitably growing market share with their fourth consecutive year of double-digit profit growth on top of industry-leading sales growth. Our supply chain investments in the region have improved the customer experience while driving productivity in our business."", ""In North America, while results fell short of our expectations, we remain focused on our strategic initiatives and continue to make solid progress. We've undertaken a comprehensive review of the NAPA business to identify key issues, and we have taken action to improve the performance at NAPA. We are confident we are focused on the right initiatives to positively impact our performance in the quarters ahead. These initiatives, along with plans for long-term investments, were rolled out to our field leadership teams and across our independent owner group in December. The teams' competitive drive and energy were on full display, and we know that the best days for NAPA are in front of us. And finally, as part of our long-term growth strategy, our teams continue to expand our footprint through bolt-on acquisitions."", ""During the year, our global automotive store count expanded by 173 net new stores, up approximately 2% from 2022. We remain disciplined on our playbook for acquisitions and are confident in our ability to continue seamlessly integrating future businesses across all our segments and geographies to create value for our shareholders. As we look ahead to 2024, we are seeing supportive industry fundamentals in both the Automotive and Industrial end markets. Within our global Automotive business, we continue to see an increase in miles driven and aging and complex vehicle fleet and high vehicle prices and financing costs all supportive for the Automotive aftermarket, and we remain uniquely positioned in this space with our global footprint. Within our industrial business, macro indicators like industrial production, and the Purchasing Managers' Index continue to show improvement after 15 months of contraction."", 'We stand to benefit from a highly diversified portfolio of customers and end markets and we are well positioned now and in the future to capitalize on reshoring trends. While industry fundamentals remain supportive, broader macroeconomic factors like high interest rates and persistent inflation in everyday purchases are pressuring the consumer and businesses alike. That said, the vast majority of parts and solutions we provide across both businesses are great fits and non-discretionary in nature. In our business, parts availability is paramount, and we are leveraging our enhanced data analytics and science to have the right part in the right place at the right time. As we continue to navigate the environment in 2024, it is imperative that we remain agile and move forward with a sense of urgency.', ""Given current market conditions, we need to continuously take action to position our business for long-term success. This morning, we announced a global restructuring initiative to further simplify and streamline our business. Will and Bert will share more about the specific actions we are taking, along with the financial implications. So in closing, we are proud to have delivered on our financial commitments for 2023. We accomplished this while taking decisive actions to improve our NAPA business in the U.S. while at the same time, investing in our strategic priorities to drive profitable growth. We believe the execution of our strategic initiatives, along with our teams' relentless focus on our customers, will drive value for our customers and our shareholders, both now and for years to come."", ""So with that, I'll turn the call over to Will."", 'Will Stengel: Thank you, Paul. Good morning, everyone. I want to start by adding my thanks to the global GPC team for another great year and for their ongoing dedication to serving our customers. In addition to delivering solid financial results for the year, we also made significant progress on our strategic initiatives, many of which we shared at our Investor Day last March. Globally, we align our strategic initiatives around five foundational priorities, which include talent and culture, sales effectiveness, technology, supply chain and emerging technology complemented by disciplined and value-creating M&A. Our focus around these priorities drives global team alignment as we continuously improve the customer experience and deliver profitable growth.', 'Turning to our results by business segment. During the fourth quarter, total sales for Global Industrial were $2.1 billion, an increase of 2% with comparable sales growth of 1% versus the same period last year and 18% on a two-year basis. Average daily sales were essentially flat in October with low single-digit growth in both November and December. Motion saw mixed results across its various end markets similar to last quarter, with particular strength in iron and steel, chemicals and mining. Categories like equipment and machinery and oil and gas were underperformers relative to the fourth quarter average. Motion continues to make excellent progress with initiatives, including sales excellence, pricing, e-commerce, technology and supply chain strategies that are helping to win profitable market share and improve productivity.', ""For the full year, Motion sales grew $414 million or 5% with comparable sales of 5% and 22% on a 2-year basis. I'd like to take a quick moment to highlight our Motion team in Asia Pacific, who delivered a fantastic year. Sales and profit were up double digits in 2023 and the team continues to outperform our expectations. Industrial segment profit in the fourth quarter was $275 million, up 19% and 12.9% sales, representing a 190 basis point increase from the same period last year. For the full year, Industrial segment profit was $1.1 billion up 24% and 12.5% of sales, representing a 200 basis point increase from the same period last year and exceeding the 2025 target that we set at our Investor Day. Bert will take you through more detail on our outlook for the Industrial segment margin, but we're confident that our strategic initiatives can continue to deliver margin expansion."", ""Throughout 2023, the profit improvement in Industrial was primarily driven by strategic pricing excellent operating discipline, the execution of our productivity initiatives and the accelerated integration of KDG. When we announced the acquisition of KDG in December of 2021 we set a target of approximately $50 million of synergies to be accomplished over a three-year period. We're proud to say that the integration of KDG is complete and we've realized $70 million of synergies a full year ahead of schedule. Turning to the Global Automotive segment, during the fourth quarter our International Automotive businesses posted positive sales growth in local currency, while sales declined at U.S. Automotive. Total sales for global automotive increased approximately 1% for the quarter, with comparable store sales decreasing 3%."", 'For the full year, total sales for the Global Automotive segment increased 4% with comparable store sales increasing 2%, in-line with our guidance. The moderation in the sales benefit from inflation continues to be a factor in our year-over-year comparisons. As expected, Global Automotive sales inflation moderated throughout the year and ended the year in the low single-digit range compared to a high single-digit range in the fourth quarter of 2022. Global Automotive segment profit in the fourth quarter was $259 million and segment operating margin was 7.5%, down 110 basis points. In the fourth quarter, all of our international geographies delivered margin expansion, although Global Automotive segment margin was negatively impacted by the performance at U.S. Automotive.', ""For the full year, automotive segment profit decreased approximately 1% versus the same period last year and segment operating margin was 8.2%, down 50 basis points year-over-year. Now let's turn to our automotive business performance by geography. Starting in Europe, our automotive team delivered another strong quarter with total sales growth of 10% in local currency and comparable sales growth of 4%. For the year, total sales growth was 16% in local currency with comparable sales growth of 8%. We're winning profitable market share gains across our European markets due to the on-going execution of our initiatives and strategic value-creating acquisitions. During the fourth quarter, we saw low single-digit to double-digit growth across each of our geographies and for the year, we delivered mid-single-digit to double-digit growth across each of our markets."", 'This was driven by continued wins with key accounts, winning higher share of wallet with existing accounts and expanding the NAPA brand, generating over $400 million in the region, which exceeds our internal target for 2023. Congratulations to the entire AAG team for another outstanding year. In the Asia-Pac automotive business, sales in the fourth quarter increased 2% in local currency with comparable sales growth of 1%. This compares to strong double-digit growth in the comparable period last year. Sales for both commercial and retail were up in the fourth quarter. The team is executing well, converting the sales momentum in the quarter into strong operating margin expansion. For the year, sales increased 7% in local currency and comparable sales increased 6%.', ""Sales for both commercial and retail were up in the year with commercial growth up mid-single digits and retail growth up high single digits. Our Asia-Pacific team had another fantastic year and their fourth consecutive year of double-digit profit growth. They continue to drive market share gains, deliver strong operating leverage and strategically invest for long-term success. Congratulations again to the Asia-Pacific team on another great year. In Canada, sales grew approximately 1% in local currency during the fourth quarter, with comparable sales decreasing approximately 1%. For the year, total sales grew 5% in local currency, with comparable sales increasing 4%. We're pleased with the Canadian team's growth this year and the execution of their strategic initiatives, despite a softer macroeconomic backdrop and a more cautious consumer in Canada."", ""In the US, automotive sales declined 5.6% during the fourth quarter, with comparable sales down 6.1%. A reminder that our comparable sales figure includes same-store sales out from our company-owned stores, as well as same-store sales into our independent owned stores. In the quarter, sales to commercial customers were down low single digits, while sales to DIY customers were down mid-single digits. For commercial, NAPA Auto Care saw low single-digit growth while major accounts sales were down mid-single digits. Let me provide an update on the priority actions we're taking at NAPA that we explained on our third quarter call. We detailed three key areas to improve, including operational rigor in our stores, addressing fill rates in key product categories and working with our commercial teams to address growth opportunities in the field."", ""First, we completed changes to certain key suppliers to improve fill rates. The changes have improved category trends in the fourth quarter and we're encouraged by the positive momentum. Second, our in-store service levels measured by on-time delivery to customers have significantly improved, as a result of increased focus on last-mile operating disciplines. Lastly, our commercial efforts are on-going and were highlighted by the appointment of Tom Skov to a newly created role of EVP Sales and Store Operations for NAPA. Previously serving as a Division Vice President in the West, Tom has over 20 years of field sales and operations experience with NAPA. He's an automotive parts expert and has a deep understanding of our customer's field sales and store operations."", ""We're excited for the strong leadership Tom will bring to our sales and store operations field teams. While these actions drove encouraging improvements, the fourth quarter results at NAPA still missed our expectations. As we mentioned previously, the fourth quarter and December in particular, were difficult year-over-year sales comparisons for NAPA. Our average daily sales growth for NAPA in the fourth quarter of 2022 was 10%, which included approximately 8% benefit from inflation with December 2022 sales up 13%. As expected, the benefit from inflation did not repeat in the fourth quarter of 2023. Further, December 2022 included the benefits of extreme winter weather for most of the U.S. With that context, as we look within the current fourth quarter for U.S. Automotive, the first two months of the quarter were in-line with our outlook that we shared last quarter."", ""December performance, however, was well below our expectations, driven by unseasonably warm weather and moderated purchases from our independent owners. We have the opportunity to be with many of our largest owners at a week-long meeting in December. It was a productive series of discussions with high energy and good engagement. The outlook for the market fundamentals remains positive. We reviewed areas of commercial focus and detailed key initiatives to deliver profitable growth together. The NAPA competitive spirit is certainly high. A theme from the owner's feedback highlighted on-going efforts to manage their purchases as they balance operating costs in the current environment. Based on the session feedback, however, we remain optimistic that owners purchasing behaviors return to more normal patterns in 2024 and we're encouraged by the performance in January, albeit it's only one month."", 'As we reflect on 2023 and move forward, we will continue to evolve our operating model at U.S. Automotive. We will be more intentional about owning more stores. A higher mix of company-owned stores in targeted priority markets enables us to service our repair shop and commercial customers more consistently and completely. We are also working actively to better align incentives with our independent owners to partner and grow together. We have current and future opportunities to create value in both our owned and independent owned locations. As an example, during the fourth quarter, we made strategic acquisitions of 33 NAPA stores from our independent owners, ending the year with approximately 1,560 company-owned stores up 20% versus 2021. While owner acquisitions have been a long-standing aspect of the business, these trends accelerated in the fourth quarter and second half of 2023 and we would expect these accelerated trends to continue into 2024.', ""The NAPA business navigated unexpected challenges in 2023, but the team adjusted and took decisive action to step up our operational intensity, simplify our priorities and improve service to our customers. As we look back during the year, a few highlights. We brought in new leadership with Randy Brow now leading the team and a proven internal leader as the new CFO. These seasoned executives got to work quickly identifying opportunities and improved our business clarity and priorities. We quickly assessed costs and took action to increase productivity and efficiency. We partnered with new suppliers to address poor fill rates in select key categories and surgically invested in inventory breadth and depth. We identified opportunities within our stores and DCs to improve our processes to ensure that we're delivering our customer commitments and executing locally."", ""We accelerated progress on foundational talent, technology and supply chain investments, including as one example, a strategic global partnership with Google for analytics and search. And we're encouraged by some recent wins, including a structured inside sales program, planned introduction of new product lines and recent traction with loyalty programs with key customers. In 2024, we believe that supportive industry fundamentals combined with clear priorities and urgent action position NAPA to deliver success. For GPC, overall, our global teams are already actively executing 2024 priorities, focused on our key strategic initiatives across our businesses. We know evolving market environments require us to continuously evolve with them and to that end, as Paul mentioned, we announced a coordinated restructuring program across each of our global geographies."", ""The primary objective of the global program is to continue to simplify and streamline our operations, consistent with our overall business strategy. When we simplify, we increase the speed of local service, deliver operational productivity, improve the efficiency of our teams and reduce our overall cost to serve. This program is a similar playbook to our previous GPC program implemented in fall 2019 that delivered positive results. Aspects of the restructuring are already in flight and some will take place in the months ahead. Bert will go over the financial details of our restructuring and his remarks and update you on how it's reflected in our 2024 outlook. In closing, GPC delivered solid fourth quarter and full year results and we achieved the plan we laid out for 2023."", ""This was driven by the benefit of our strategic business mix and global geographic diversification. Most importantly, it was driven by incredible effort from our global teammates to take care of our customers, live our GPC values every day and deliver performance. We're committed to our plans for long-term growth, and we're confident our teams are focused on the right strategic initiatives that will deliver solutions for our customers and create value. Thank you, again, to the entire GPC team for another great year. And with that, I'll turn the call over to Bert."", 'Bert Nappier: Thank you, Will and thanks to everyone for joining us today. Our performance in the fourth quarter and full year continues to demonstrate our long history of delivering earnings and cash flow growth, while maintaining a strong balance sheet. Our results, which include double-digit earnings growth in the fourth quarter and for 2023 were achieved while navigating through a dynamic and challenging year. Before I walk you through the key highlights of our fourth quarter and full year performance, I would like to note that we had no nonrecurring items in the fourth quarter and 12 months of 2023. Our comparisons to prior year, however, exclude nonrecurring items in 2022, primarily related to the integration of KDG and an adjustment in the fourth quarter related to a remeasurement of our product liability reserve.', 'As we look at 2023, sales totalled $23.1 billion, up 4.5% from 2022 and consistent with our guidance. In the fourth quarter, sales increased 1.1% and with a 2% contribution from acquisitions and a 0.3% favorable impact of foreign currency and other. These items were partially offset by a 1.2% decrease in comparable sales. During the quarter, we experienced low single-digit levels of inflation in both our automotive and industrial segments in line with our expectations. As Will outlined, our fourth quarter sales performance was highlighted by the growth in Europe, Australasia and industrial, offset by the decline in U.S. Automotive. During the fourth quarter, our gross margin expanded by approximately 70 basis points. And for the year, our gross margin was 35.9%, an 80 basis point improvement from our adjusted gross margin in 2022.', 'Our gross margin expansion was primarily driven by the execution of our strategic pricing and sourcing initiatives through investments in technology that enabled us to leverage data and analytics to ensure we have the right inventory for our customers to meet their needs. Total operating and non-operating expenses were 28.9% of sales in the fourth quarter, an increase of approximately 20 basis points from total adjusted expenses in the prior year. For the year, total expenses were 28.4% of sales, a 50 basis point increase from adjusted expenses in 2022. During 2023, we anticipated 60 basis points of deleverage related to our planned investments in team members and increased spending in technology, both of which came in line with our expectations.', ""These investments were partially offset by cost actions throughout the year, particularly at U.S. Automotive. Despite the deleverage in SG&A, our fourth quarter gross margin expansion drove segment profit margin up 10 basis points to 9.6%. For the year, segment profit margin was 9.9%, a notable 50 basis point increase from 2022 and highlighted by our team at Motion driving an impressive 200 basis points of margin expansion on mid-single-digit sales growth with industrial now representing approximately 50% of GPC's profit pool. Our fourth quarter earnings were $2.26 per diluted share compared to $2.05 per adjusted diluted share in the same period last year, an increase of 10.2%. For the full year, earnings were $9.33 per diluted share compared to $8.34 per adjusted diluted share in 2022, an increase of 11.9%."", ""Turning to our cash flows. For the year, we generated $1.4 billion in cash from operations and over $900 million in free cash flow, both in line with our guidance. During the quarter, we issued $800 million of senior unsecured notes and used $250 million of the proceeds to repay debt that matured in December 2023. We closed the year with $2.6 billion in available liquidity, and our debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio was 1.8x, which compares to our targeted range of 2x to 2.5x. Our capital expenditures in 2023, which totaled approximately $500 million or 2.2% of revenue, we're focused on driving the strategic initiatives we showcased at our March 2023 Investor Day. For 2023, 60% of our CapEx was growth capital centered on technology and supply chain capabilities, including projects related to distribution center expansion and modernization, fulfilment centers at Motion and using technology to enhance our catalogue and payment platforms."", 'While modestly above our original expectations, the areas where we are investing are delivering good returns well above our cost of capital. We continue to make progress on the M&A front in 2023, a long-standing aspect of our growth strategy. During the year, we completed approximately 90 transactions, investing $309 million, with virtually all of these transactions in the Automotive segment. The blended EBITDA rate of the businesses acquired was over 9% on a pre-synergy basis and is accretive to our overall Automotive segment margin, demonstrating the discipline we have in the space. In 2023, we returned approximately $788 million or 55% of our operating cash flows to our shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases. This includes $527 million in cash dividends paid to our shareholders and $261 million in cash used to repurchase 1.8 million shares.', 'Before we turn to our outlook for 2024, as you heard earlier from Paul and Will, this morning, we announced a global restructuring designed to reduce our SG&A costs, improve efficiency and accelerate investments. In 2024, we expect to incur costs of approximately $100 million to $200 million related to our restructuring efforts, and we will report this as a nonrecurring expense. Through these efforts, we anticipate a benefit of $20 million to $40 million in 2024 and $45 million to $90 million on an annualized basis. Our current restructuring activities reflect our discipline to continuously refine and improve our business and ensure we are taking the necessary actions to position us to achieve our long-term targets. As we turn to 2024, we are balancing solid industry fundamentals, which remain supportive for long-term growth across our businesses against a backdrop of mixed economic conditions, driven by high interest rates and persistent cost inflation.', 'Despite this, we remain confident in the execution of our strategic initiatives and the benefits we expect to realize. For the year, we expect total sales growth to be in a range of 3% to 5%. We anticipate a more moderated first half and stronger second half in 2024 for both automotive and industrial. Included in our outlook is the assumption that the benefit from inflation remains at more normalized levels contributing less than 1% for both business segments. We are targeting full year gross margin expansion of approximately 20 to 40 basis points, primarily driven by our continued focus on our strategic sourcing and pricing initiatives. Our outlook assumes that SG&A will deleverage between 20 and 30 basis points from further investments in technology.', 'Our technology investments are key to enabling our strategic initiatives. We expect diluted earnings per share to be in the range of $8.95 to $9.15 and adjusted diluted earnings per share to be in the range of $9.70 to $9.90, which represents an increase of 4% to 6% to last year. Our adjusted earnings per share guidance includes approximately $0.10 of EPS benefit related to our restructuring initiatives, which represents about half of the savings we are targeting for 2024. The successful execution of all our restructuring initiatives in 2024 provides an additional $0.05 to $0.10 EPS benefit, not included in our guidance. By business segment, we are guiding to the following; 2% to 4% total sales growth for the Automotive segment, with comparable sales growth in the 1% to 3% range.', 'As we consider our sales guidance for automotive, our growth rate will be negatively impacted in 2024 and by approximately 100 basis points from new incentive programs associated with changes to certain supplier arrangements we previously announced in the U.S. Automotive business. Historically, these programs have been managed by our suppliers. Under the new arrangements, these will be managed by our U.S. automotive team. The new arrangements will be accounted for as a reduction of revenue, however, have a corresponding reduction of cost of goods sold and as a result, have no negative impact to gross profit. For Global Automotive segment margin, we expect 20 to 40 basis points of expansion year-over-year. For the Industrial segment, we expect total sales growth of 3% to 5% and with comparable sales growth in the 2% to 4% range.', 'For 2024, we anticipate Global Industrial segment margin to expand by approximately 10 to 20 basis points year-over-year after finishing 2023 at 12.5%. Our performance in 2023 exceeded our long-term target of 12%, driven in part by our outstanding work to integrate KDG a year ahead of schedule. We will revisit our long-term target for Industrial in the future, but we see further opportunities for margin expansion in 2024 and beyond. And finally, we are targeting corporate expense to be approximately 1.5% to 2% of sales. Turning to a few other items of interest. With our strong balance sheet and cash flows, we are well positioned to take advantage of opportunities that fit with our long-term growth strategies regardless of the economic backdrop.', 'In 2024, we will continue our long history of balanced capital allocation with four priorities; capital expenditures, M&A, our dividend and share repurchases. During the fourth quarter, we added a new capability and further flexibility to pursue strategic investments with our commercial paper program launched in December. Our cash flows will remain strong in 2024 as we expect cash from operations to be in a range of $1.3 billion to $1.5 billion with free cash flow of $800 million to $1 billion. As we outlined at Investor Day, investments in our supply chain and IT capabilities are central to our success. For 2024, we expect CapEx to be approximately $500 million or 2% of revenue, consistent with 2023. As we look at 2024, the growth capital we are deploying, which is approximately 55% of our forecast will drive modernization of our supply chain through automation and new DCs and fulfilment locations that are partnered with technology that enhances our customer experience like our investments in catalogue and search platforms through our partnership with Google.', 'As we look at M&A, our global pipeline remains robust and we continue to remain disciplined pursuing opportunities that create value. Our strong track record of success, combined with our ability to put our balance sheet to work positions us well to further grow our global scale and footprint. In maintaining our focus on shareholder returns, this morning, our Board approved a $4 per share annual dividend for 2024, representing our 68th consecutive increase to our annual dividend. This represents a 5.3% increase from the $3.80 per share paid in 2023. In closing, our teams managed the business through a dynamic environment in 2023, including navigating unexpected pressures in our U.S. automotive business, while achieving mid-single-digit sales growth, gross margin expansion, segment margin expansion and double-digit earnings growth.', 'As we look ahead to 2024, we will continue to strategically invest in our business for the long term while taking actions to better align our assets in the near term and maintain our strong balance sheet. We look forward to updating you on our progress as we move throughout the year. Thank you, and we will now turn it back to the operator for your questions.', 'See also Top 16 Aircraft Manufacturers In The World and 20 Cities With The Highest Cost of Living in the US.', 'To continue reading the Q&A session, please click here.']"

(NYSE:CMI) Just Because It's Going Ex-Dividend,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/dont-race-buy-cummins-inc-121918163.html,1708172358,STORY,['CMI'],"[""Cummins Inc. (NYSE:CMI) is about to trade ex-dividend in the next 4 days. The ex-dividend date is one business day before the record date, which is the cut-off date for shareholders to be present on the company's books to be eligible for a dividend payment. The ex-dividend date is an important date to be aware of as any purchase of the stock made on or after this date might mean a late settlement that doesn't show on the record date. Thus, you can purchase Cummins' shares before the 22nd of February in order to receive the dividend, which the company will pay on the 7th of March."", ""The company's next dividend payment will be US$1.68 per share, and in the last 12 months, the company paid a total of US$6.72 per share. Last year's total dividend payments show that Cummins has a trailing yield of 2.5% on the current share price of US$266.48. Dividends are an important source of income to many shareholders, but the health of the business is crucial to maintaining those dividends. That's why we should always check whether the dividend payments appear sustainable, and if the company is growing."", ' View our latest analysis for Cummins ', 'Dividends are typically paid out of company income, so if a company pays out more than it earned, its dividend is usually at a higher risk of being cut. Cummins distributed an unsustainably high 125% of its profit as dividends to shareholders last year. Without more sustainable payment behaviour, the dividend looks precarious. Yet cash flow is typically more important than profit for assessing dividend sustainability, so we should always check if the company generated enough cash to afford its dividend. Fortunately, it paid out only 33% of its free cash flow in the past year.', ""It's disappointing to see that the dividend was not covered by profits, but cash is more important from a dividend sustainability perspective, and Cummins fortunately did generate enough cash to fund its dividend. If executives were to continue paying more in dividends than the company reported in profits, we'd view this as a warning sign. Very few companies are able to sustainably pay dividends larger than their reported earnings."", ""Click here to see the company's payout ratio, plus analyst estimates of its future dividends."", ""When earnings decline, dividend companies become much harder to analyse and own safely. Investors love dividends, so if earnings fall and the dividend is reduced, expect a stock to be sold off heavily at the same time. Readers will understand then, why we're concerned to see Cummins's earnings per share have dropped 17% a year over the past five years. When earnings per share fall, the maximum amount of dividends that can be paid also falls."", ""Many investors will assess a company's dividend performance by evaluating how much the dividend payments have changed over time. Since the start of our data, 10 years ago, Cummins has lifted its dividend by approximately 13% a year on average. That's intriguing, but the combination of growing dividends despite declining earnings can typically only be achieved by paying out a larger percentage of profits. Cummins is already paying out 125% of its profits, and with shrinking earnings we think it's unlikely that this dividend will grow quickly in the future."", ""Should investors buy Cummins for the upcoming dividend? It's never great to see earnings per share declining, especially when a company is paying out 125% of its profit as dividends, which we feel is uncomfortably high. Yet cashflow was much stronger, which makes us wonder if there are some large timing issues in Cummins's cash flows, or perhaps the company has written down some assets aggressively, reducing its income. It's not the most attractive proposition from a dividend perspective, and we'd probably give this one a miss for now."", ""So if you're still interested in Cummins despite it's poor dividend qualities, you should be well informed on some of the risks facing this stock. For example - Cummins has 2 warning signs we think you should be aware of."", ""Generally, we wouldn't recommend just buying the first dividend stock you see.

But looking at the data, these three dominate the field:', ""Netflix (NASDAQ: NFLX) benefited as the first mover in streaming, evolving from mail-in DVDs to digital content in 2007. Today, it's the industry's biggest service, with over 260 paying subscribers worldwide. The company initially leaned on licensing third-party content, but wisely spent years building up original programming to prepare for a time when media companies would hoard their intellectual content for their competing services."", ""Media giant Walt Disney (NYSE: DIS) didn't go all-out on streaming until late 2019 when it launched Disney+. However, the company's unmatched content portfolio has catapulted Disney to near the top. It operates a trio of services, including Disney+ (150 million subscribers), ESPN+ (26 million), and Hulu (48.5 million).

Amazon has over 200 million subscribers via Prime, and the company has invested in its streaming offerings by acquiring MGM for $8.5 billion in 2022, giving it ownership of thousands of television shows and movies. It also jumped into live sports, purchasing broadcasting rights for the National Football League's (NFL) Thursday Night Football games."", ""The next closest streaming service, HBO Max, has a solid 94 million users, but it's still less than half of third-place Amazon, and the drop off only continues as you move down from the top 10."", ""It's looking increasingly likely like streaming is a winner-takes-most type of industry, at least based on what consumers told The Motley Fool. Approximately 62% of those surveyed believe there are too many streaming options, and over a third of respondents have actively reduced their number of streaming services since last year."", ""Streaming's original appeal was that desired content was easily accessible, and cutting the cord would save money versus cable. But that's changed a bit. Media companies are pulling back their best content, locking it behind their respective streaming services. That means your favorite movies or shows are spread across different services, which hurts the consumer experience."", ""Interestingly, streaming usage peaks in the summer and drops over the holidays. The reason? That's when live sports and holiday programming peak. The absence of these, especially live sports, remains a weakness for most streaming platforms."", 'Live sports are still a big draw for viewers, meaning that winning broadcast rights to live sports could be a long-term advantage as companies fight for streaming market share. The NFL dominates U.S. households. According to Nielsen, 93 of the top 100 most-watched TV programs in 2023 were NFL games.', ""Amazon (Thursday Night Football) and Disney (Monday Night Football) both own broadcasting rights for NFL games, leaving Netflix on the outside looking in. Netflix had its first live event, a special Golf Cup, in late November 2023. The evolution of live sports could play a big role in streaming's future."", ""It's tough to knock any of these three companies. One is the market leader in streaming, while the other two have complementary businesses outside of streaming that give investors additional upside."", 'Deciding a winner may come down to which stock currently offers the best value and expected growth.', ""The companies' forward P/E ratios shows that Disney is currently the cheapest at about 24 times earnings, followed by Netflix at 33, then Amazon at 41. Using consensus long-term analyst estimates, Netflix is projected to grow earnings the fastest, followed by Amazon and Disney."", ""To make sense of this, I like using the PEG ratio, a favorite metric of famed investor Peter Lynch. The ratio shows how much you pay for a company's future growth. Based on this, Netflix's PEG ratio of 1.1 is the most attractive for its prospective growth, followed by Disney's 1.4, then Amazon's 1.6."", ""Long-term investors should look for how Netflix will expand its content library in the future. Adding notable live sports could lock in its substantial market share.

According to data compiled by S&P Global Market Intelligence, the company's shares tumbled by more than 20% in value over the period. The main reason was abundantly clear."", ""The No. 1 culprit was Penn Entertainment's fourth-quarter earnings, which were published before market open on Thursday. These revealed that the company's revenue fell by 12% year over year to just under $1.4 billion. More uncomfortably, it flipped to a bottom-line loss of almost $359 million compared to a profit of just under $21 million in the year-ago period."", 'On a non-GAAP (adjusted) basis, that net loss amounted to $1.75 per share, far steeper than the $0.50 average estimate from analysts tracking the stock. Penn Entertainment also missed on revenue, as those prognosticators were collectively expecting it to earn $1.55 billion.', ""Much of the shortfall derived from the company's ESPN Bet, an online sportsbook leveraging Walt Disney's well-known sports channel's brand name. This has a lot of potential, thanks to the spread of legalized gambling throughout the U.S., but it isn't a money maker yet. Against revenues just short of $32 million for the quarter, ESPN Bet posted an adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) of nearly $334 million."", 'Penn Entertainment did not proffer guidance for either its current (first) quarter or full-year 2024. It did indicate it would continue to pursue its strategy of pushing what it terms ""solid property level performance"" in its physical gaming facilities and investing in its digital gambling assets.', 'Should you invest $1,000 in Penn Entertainment right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Penn Entertainment, consider this:', 'The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\xa010 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Penn Entertainment wasn’t one of them.

The group holding the most number of shares in the company, around 66% to be precise, is institutions. That is, the group stands to benefit the most if the stock rises (or lose the most if there is a downturn)."", 'Given the vast amount of money and research capacities at their disposal, institutional ownership tends to carry a lot of weight, especially with individual investors. Hence, having a considerable amount of institutional money invested in a company is often regarded as a desirable trait.', ""Let's delve deeper into each type of owner of Walt Disney, beginning with the chart below."", ' See our latest analysis for Walt Disney ', 'Many institutions measure their performance against an index that approximates the local market. So they usually pay more attention to companies that are included in major indices.', ""Walt Disney already has institutions on the share registry. Indeed, they own a respectable stake in the company. This suggests some credibility amongst professional investors. But we can't rely on that fact alone since institutions make bad investments sometimes, just like everyone does. When multiple institutions own a stock, there's always a risk that they are in a 'crowded trade'. When such a trade goes wrong, multiple parties may compete to sell stock fast. This risk is higher in a company without a history of growth. You can see Walt Disney's historic earnings and revenue below, but keep in mind there's always more to the story."", ""Investors should note that institutions actually own more than half the company, so they can collectively wield significant power. We note that hedge funds don't have a meaningful investment in Walt Disney. The Vanguard Group, Inc. is currently the company's largest shareholder with 8.2% of shares outstanding. For context, the second largest shareholder holds about 6.6% of the shares outstanding, followed by an ownership of 4.1% by the third-largest shareholder."", 'A deeper look at our ownership data shows that the top 25 shareholders collectively hold less than half of the register, suggesting a large group of small holders where no single shareholder has a majority.', ""While studying institutional ownership for a company can add value to your research, it is also a good practice to research analyst recommendations to get a deeper understand of a stock's expected performance. There are a reasonable number of analysts covering the stock, so it might be useful to find out their aggregate view on the future."", 'The definition of company insiders can be subjective and does vary between jurisdictions. Our data reflects individual insiders, capturing board members at the very least. Company management run the business, but the CEO will answer to the board, even if he or she is a member of it.', 'Most consider insider ownership a positive because it can indicate the board is well aligned with other shareholders. However, on some occasions too much power is concentrated within this group.', 'Our most recent data indicates that insiders own less than 1% of The Walt Disney Company. Being so large, we would not expect insiders to own a large proportion of the stock. Collectively, they own US$58m of stock. It is always good to see at least some insider ownership, but it might be worth checking if those insiders have been selling. ', ""The general public, who are usually individual investors, hold a 34% stake in Walt Disney. While this group can't necessarily call the shots, it can certainly have a real influence on how the company is run."", ""I find it very interesting to look at who exactly owns a company.

We have opinions. Motley Fool Money starts now. Welcome to Motley Fool Money. I'm Deidre Woollard here with my co-host, Ricky Mulvey, and our engineer, Dan Boyd. For a Special Ads Review Monday, we're going to evaluate some of the ads we saw yesterday. See if those publicly traded companies get their seven million dollars for 30 seconds money worth. Welcome guys. How do you enjoy the game?"", ""Dan Boyd: Well, the game was actually good this time, so it's nice that the Super Bowl was a good game for once. It was a good time."", 'Ricky Mulvey: Good game. I appreciate the rule change that holding is no longer an offensive penalty.', ""Deidre Woollard: Well, I was thinking about the ads last night, dividing them up into the reasons that a company runs an ad that costs that much. I mean, obviously you've got the audience, but you have to have a reason, I think. There's general awareness. I mean that's like you're Budweiser or something like that. There's a special promotion like the Turbotax thing. You've got maybe a new flavor of something or a movie. What else? What other reasons do companies have for spending all this money?"", ""Ricky Mulvey: I mean, I think there's the element on the biggest stage. Look at how good we are, look at how good we are as a brand. The NFL did that, Dove did that. I will save my comments about Pfizer. Also don't discount the ego element among some marketing executives. This is the biggest stage for marketers. You know, the folks in the C suite know that and this is their time to maybe show off a little bit to friends. Also, I would say rebranding. A few in that would be Snapchat. SnapChat had a big campaign that it's not social media, it's so much healthier than that, Diedre also, soda is good for you now all pops make in that case. The company in the middle of a little bit of a rebrand is Budweiser and Bud Light specifically. Instead of it had its scandal with TikTok, it also, it had a lighter touch in Super Bowl's last year with Miles Teller just dancing in an apartment, drinking Budweiser with his wife, listening to hold music. No, now it's back in neighborhood bars, you know. Remember us, you love us. You bring us to parties. Hey, we even cast a white guy as a genie. Look at us, we're all the way back. We're Bud Light."", ""Dan Boyd: One thing I had a problem with that commercial, but in a weird way, they were like waiting in line to get into a place. Then the genie like zapped him into the place and it turned out it was just some like regular old neighborhood bar looking place. I was like, they don't have lines at those, What do you do in Bud Light?"", ""Deidre Woollard: But also it was popping, on Olipop. Clearly that brand didn't quite work. [laughs]"", 'Dan Boyd: Could you say soda more in a commercial? Every other word was soda. It was extremely grating.', ""Ricky Mulvey: They got the message cleared, but I forgot the I don't know why I thought it was Olipop instead of Poppy."", ""Deidre Woollard: They look very similar. There's not a lot of differentiation there."", ""Dan Boyd: I also like the vagueness about the poppy. It was like it's soda, but it's good. How is it good? Trust us, it's good."", ""Deidre Woollard: Exactly well, and this year was different too 'cause it was on CBS, which is part of Paramount, which also owns Nickelodeon. You had this second Bunge, Bobby more family friendly feed. Mostly the same ads, although I guess there were some of them that were cheaper around 300,000 for just so that's much cheaper according to ad age. But I'm wondering about this division now because it seems like we're not necessarily gathering around the big linear TV anymore. Maybe people are watching on streaming, maybe people are watching on other channels. Is this the future where it's not all in one spot?"", ""Ricky Mulvey: I think it makes a ton of sense. People have been doing this on Twitch for years now where you live. Like people want to see a stream of someone watching a thing. If you have, your kids are probably going to watch Sponge Bob a little bit more. I watched some of the highlight clips. A little cringy but also funny. You know, you have George Kittle explaining how he wants to meet Larry the lobster. Larry the lobster track, talking a little bit of trash back. I think it makes a ton of sense. Also if you're a marketer, you can focus in a little bit more if you're buying a cheaper ad on Nickelodeon where maybe the CPM is a little bit higher versus that like hugely expensive ad on the national broadcast."", 'Dan Boyd: My question is, did families even watch the Nickelodeon broadcast? Because the only people I know that watched it were irony poisoned 30 somethings who are doing it for a laugh.', 'Ricky Mulvey: I mean, how many irony poison 30 somethings do you know versus like.', 'Dan Boyd: I know a lot of both as a father of a toddler, you know, I travel in both circles Ricky.', ""Ricky Mulvey: I don't know how appealing it is to watch the entire game on like the Nickelodeon cast, but I don't know. I'm sure a lot of folks checked it out."", ""Deidre Woollard: I think it's a very different experience in terms of you're not I don't think you're gathering around and having a party around the Nickelodeon cast, but I could be wrong, and Paramount, they had the home field advantage in terms of putting lots of CBS promos on there, but you also had a lot of Disney. Who did it better? What do you think?"", 'Dan Boyd: Well, the point I wanted to make real quick, I just want to backtrack a little bit and say Ricky is spot on with the twitch comparison. People love to watch people, they like watching something. Something like the Sponge Bob, Super Bowl broadcast, or I think they called it the Bikini Bottom broadcast.', 'Ricky Mulvey: Yeah, the game was transplanted to Bikini Bottom, Sandy Cheeks is a sideline reporter.', ""Dan Boyd: But I think that this kind of thing is only going to grow in popularity. I think that next Super Bowl will probably see some more, I don't want to say serious, but some more serious representations of this thing with Fox is my guess at least."", ""Ricky Mulvey: Then Diedre to your question, as we jump around the outline here, I mean, Disney was strongly represented, but it's tough when Paramount has that home field advantage. It's able to do its own broadcast. Disney's competing, basically, with a typewriter and a small ad for Disney plus. I would give Paramount the victory here."", ""Deidre Woollard: Let's talk about the Taylor Swift Factor. We got to talk about the Taylor Swift Factor. I mean, one of the things that I noticed is you had a different audience in there. I mean, you started off with an ad for a menopause drug early on. You've said you had ELF Cosmetics? You had Dove, which we talked about. You had a whole lot of Temu, I mean, my goodness, so much Temu, which is Pinduoduo shopping."", 'Dan Boyd: I believe it was Temu.', ""Deidre Woollard: Temu, I know. I should have learned. It's terrible. They spent so big, so much and the ads, they weren't great, they were annoying. Did that pay off at all?"", ""Ricky Mulvey: I mean, let's focus first on Taylor Swift. They did not show her until the second quarter, so they waited a little bit."", ""Deidre Woollard: Because Travis wasn't doing anything the first quarter."", 'Ricky Mulvey: I know, but you can still get the reactions like go, no.', 'Dan Boyd: The restraint. It was amazing.', ""Ricky Mulvey: Bold strategy. You play the same low budget animation commercial three times over the Super Bowl. That space is $21 million. I think they had about a 21 million and $15 marketing budget. However, for as much hate as Temu is getting, if you look at the App Store right now, it's the number one shopping app. It has some class action lawsuits against it that I would recommend listeners check out before they start buying things on there. It also on the google search traffic page, it looks like the buzz is wearing off fairly quickly, but you know what, is it better to have a cringy advertisement that people are talking about? Or if you have something like, let's say Bass Pro Shop or Ford, where you spent a bunch of money on the Ad space. Then it's a complete fastball down the middle that's easily forgotten against the much more memorable advertisements. I'm going for the cringe."", ""Dan Boyd: That's a good point Ricky. Like are terrible ads good when it comes to something like the Super Bowl is something like Temu, because their ad was, so to put it mildly crappy and people are talking about it because it was an incredibly annoying song, poor animation. It looked like they'd got somebody on Fiver to do it for him, but we're talking about it on the show right now. I'm still not 100% sure what Temu is or what it does, or why I would want to use it but maybe the fact that it's a bad ad that gets a lot of reach, there might be something there."", ""Ricky Mulvey: They do incredibly cheap, like Internet goods, where they use like Drop Shippers to send it to you. It's a little bit, I would say almost a mix. It's like a weird cousin of Etsy and Amazon."", 'Dan Boyd: Is this like one of those things where they buy a bunch of super cheap stuff from like Aliexpress the market up 10 or 20% and then just sell it back to us.', 'Ricky Mulvey: Kind of.', ""Deidre Woollard: Except it's direct, so it's cheaper. It's really cheap, fast fashion."", 'Ricky Mulvey: One more thing on Temu. I will not remember the promo code that DoorDash tried to get me to remember that was like super long. I will remember Shop Like a Billionaire.', 'Dan Boyd: Yeah. What does that even mean?', ""Ricky Mulvey: It means that you're buying politicians and you own private jets, Dan Boyd."", 'Dan Boyd: They sell politicians and private jets on Temu, news to me.', ""Deidre Woollard: Well, speaking of billions. One of the things that I've been obsessed with is CoStar, which is the parent company apartments.com and homes.com, before the Super Bowl, they came out with this idea. We're telling agents basically we're going to spend billion dollars. We're basically buying our way into Zillow spot. They did all these promo things before the big game. These ads, I don't know, I was expecting something bigger. The real estate agents that I'm in social media groups with, they were also expecting something bigger. But for you guys, you don't really know that the homes.com or anything like that, did it move you? Would you be more likely to go there over Zillow?"", ""Ricky Mulvey: See plus it didn't really work on me, I thought it was weird that none of the ads really showed people buying a home or an apartment from the ones I saw."", ""Dan Boyd: It seemed like it was just hey, look at these celebrities and look at them be goofy kind of thing. The good things about like Zillow and Redfin are their ubiquitousness and how you can look up any listing or get into any neighborhood and see what the intangibles are. What's the point of homes.com can they beat that personally? I like Redfin. I think they have a very great search engine over there. I don't know, it just seemed like a waste of money to me. I like Dan Levy, the actor who was in those ads acting extra goofy, but I don't think they did what they were looking for there."", ""Deidre Woollard: I think that's a question of the celebrity in general, because we had celebrities stuffed into everything. It used to be just like you'd get one celebrity in an ad. Now you've got 3, 4, 5, 6 all over the place stuffed in everywhere. You saw an awful lot of Dan Marino, a lot of Tom Brady. What worked for you in terms of celebrity ads?"", ""Dan Boyd: The Dunkin ad. The Dunkin's with Ben Affleck and Matt Damon, and J. LO, and Tom Brady and even Fat Joe for a split second. I thought that one was extremely funny, especially with Matt Damon's reluctance to continue to be Ben Affleck's friend. I thought it was a good time."", ""Ricky Mulvey: I have an overall take on this, I'll get to it later. But I thought Mountain Dew with Aubrey Plaza and Nick Offerman, that was a funny bit. They did a good bit and it was focused. I thought the real winner for the celebrity ad was Kate McKinnon with Hellman's Mayo with like the Talking Cat."", 'Deidre Woollard: So bad.', ""Ricky Mulvey: They made the joke work a little bit. I thought it was funny, and at least it wasn't the parade of celebrities for I would say the borrowing cool factor. They did a little bit of a celebrity parade. The Lionel Messi with Michelob ULTRA, like that was pretty cool watching Messi play soccer on a beach. I don't know if you needed Dan Marino in that. I was ready to believe that mixing carbonated alcohol and cardio is a wonderful idea after watching that."", ""Dan Boyd: The Kate McKinnon thing, at one point in that ad, she's eaten mayo directly out of the jar. I physically recoiled from my TV at that moment."", 'Ricky Mulvey: But you remember that?', ""Dan Boyd: I guess so. But I mean, I'm not a mayo guy so I wasn't going to buy Hellmann's anyways."", ""Ricky Mulvey: There you go. It's not for you."", ""Deidre Woollard: Well, what do you think was the worst? For me, Etsy. I've not been loving Etsy's ad campaigns lately. I get that the try to be more than gifts, now they're trying to be really just like gifts, gifts. Really, this is what you get us for. It didn't work for me. Are there ones that like really didn't work for you?"", 'Dan Boyd: Temu was awful, but we already covered that.', ""Ricky Mulvey: That's not a celebrity ad though."", ""Deidre Woollard: No, we're not talking about celebrity ad. We can talk about worst ads in general."", ""Dan Boyd: Ricky. I felt gross watching Martin Scorsese do a Squarespace ad. That one was bad. I was cringing not this is awkward way. I was just like..Especially it was almost like a non sequitur too. It was like the ad didn't make any sense. Then you have Martin Scorsese in there and he's just in a car, like what's happening here?"", ""Ricky Mulvey: Mr. I don't really like Marvel movies is now doing Alien Squarespace ads. It's been quite quite the turn for one of my favorite directors."", ""Dan Boyd: I didn't like the Beyonce T-Mobile ad. I thought that was.."", 'Deidre Woollard: Verizon.', ""Dan Boyd: Verizon. Thank you. I thought it was wasting Beyonce. Beyonce is a charismatic force of nature, and Tony Hale, who has partnered with her in that ad, is a very funny actor and comedian. But that whole bit just fell extremely flat to me. I don't think they did well at all with that."", 'Deidre Woollard: Did you get that she was promoting her album though?', ""Dan Boyd: I think they were throwing in the release the music at the end of the ad every time and I guess there's a tie in. I don't know, it didn't make any sense. I didn't think it was anything more than just annoying, to be honest."", ""Ricky Mulvey: This is the circle of cynicism. I'll also say DoorDash. It felt like they were playing to only marketing executives by being like, look at how long this promo code is. Then I think the sign for me, I did some research before this, they gave viewers less than three seconds to scan a QR code. I will bet that there is a meeting where they are wondering why the direct response to the QR code is not going as well as they would have liked. It's because you have to be very quick on the gun to get that QR code during the Super Bowl."", ""Dan Boyd: Didn't you have your phone out the whole time chatting with your friends about the Super Bowl while you were watching it?"", ""Ricky Mulvey: Sometimes, I mean, the Super Bowl is a second screen experience. I want to see what's going on on Twitter, but I'm also, I was making some food, I was talking."", ""Dan Boyd: I guess if you're at a Super Bowl party, you probably don't have the phone out on the couch. But again, father of a toddler over here.

Some of the responses, Silk with Jeremy Renner, a guy who almost died doesn't add for bone health. Perfect use of a celebrity. That's from RKT. Eliot's 3. Neil and Rockville said Dunkin Donuts, Analog 618, going with the E trade babies, pickleball is just mini tennis with a wiffle ball, LOL. Then our next Cloud 1 said none $7 million worth. I wish I had a better answer than I don't know. I really don't know if it's any of them are worth $7 million."", ""Dan Boyd: I think it was a down year for Super Bowl ads. Just nothing all that funny. I think that the Dunkin ad stands out as the funniest for me. But there was really no laugh out loud moments during the ads. That's something that was definitely missing. The whole part of the entertainment of Super Bowl ads, I think, is that you got to have funny ones. There were definitely some extremely not funny ads this time around with like the anti bullying campaign from the NFL and things of that nature, which are important and good, but it's not what I'm looking for when it comes to Super Bowl ad entertainment. I definitely would call it a down year. I liked the Hellmann's ad. That made me laugh. I know you didn't think it was funny. They got one person."", ""Ricky Mulvey: I'll also say to it."", 'Dan Boyd: Is that worth $7 million?', 'Deidre Woollard: Ricky thinks this is worth $7 million.', ""Ricky Mulvey: That's why I said I don't know. One thing though on the overall it did make me think about awareness marketing and, is it worth it? Who does it the best? Because the companies that spend a lot of money on awareness marketing are, I think of energy drinks. Monster Energy, you don't see them doing Super Bowl ads, but they spend a ton of money on awareness marketing. The reason it works for them is because they're able to fully integrate into very specific events, motocross, monster trucks, the UFC. They know their audience really well and they show you that logo again and again and again. I think that's really hard to do in a 30 second commercial when you're competing against so many other advertisers."", ""Dan Boyd: That's a good point. That's a really good point. Hey, not a whole lot of Crypto ads this year."", ""Ricky Mulvey: No, where'd they go?"", 'Deidre Woollard: Interesting things change. Well, thanks guys.', 'Dan Boyd: Thanks Deidre.', ""Ricky Mulvey: Ricky Mulvey, co-host of Motley Fool Money here, have you been using Mint to manage your finances?

Monarch is the top rated all in one personal finance app and now you can get an extended 30-day free trial when you go to monarchmoney.com/fool.

But what about the stocks behind the apps? Mary Long talked with Rick Munarriz about what to look for in matchmaking companies and which ones might be worth making a commitment to.', ""Mary Long: I think to talk about dating apps stocks feels a bit like a story of David and Goliath, because in one corner you've got Match Group, which is a $10.2 billion behemoth that owns Tinder or Hinge, Match about 40 dating apps and sites. The other corner there's Bumble with a $1.87 billion market cap, why would a person put their money on Bumble, the seeming underdog in this fight?"", ""Rick Munarriz: Well, Bumble slingshot in this fight is growth. This David, is consistently growing faster than the Goliath in this example. Bumble has turned annual revenue growth of at least 18% for four consecutive years. It's up 18% through the first nine months of 2023. Another reason to invest in Bumble is that this David is actually a Davina. Founder, Whitney Wolfe Herd was a member of the Tinder founding team in 2012, but left two years later to launch a site that places women at the center of the dating app balance. Bumble became one of the first apps for only female identifying and eventually non-binary users can initiate contact with an interested match. Finally, a knock on Bumble in the past it's lack of consistent profitability on a reported basis. It's been reporting adjusted earnings for some time, but on a reported basis not so much. It finally turned the corner last year. It has come through with back to back quarters of positive net income, and that's likely to grow in the years to come."", ""Mary Long: Bumble slingshot is growth. Match is, as we've mentioned, undoubtedly larger than Bumble, but growth doesn't really seem to be happening in the same capacity. The stock is off around 80% from its all time highest and the company's biggest segment, Tinder, has seen declining numbers of new users and paying users in the latest quarter. With that in mind, what is the bull case for Match Group?"", ""Rick Munarriz: For Match, so obviously we'll start with the fact that it is the undisputed top dog. Tinder, which is the primary match app, is the world's most popular online dating app. This is a major advantage. When you tell someone after they break up that there's other fish in the sea, you want them to be splashing around in the largest ocean possible, that's Tinder. Match Group, yes, you mentioned it. It's not growing as quickly as Bumble. It delivered single digit growth in 2022 and again in 2023. But it has been profitable for years. It has that going for a long-term profitability. Finally, the third thing working right now in Match Group's favor, is that the starting line, it's kind. Right now the stock is down 80% from its all time high in 2021. It's down almost 30% from its summertime high just last summer. With profits starting to climb, now the stock is trading for just 16 times trailing earnings. This is like a meet-cute where growth and value just bump into one another at a train station. I think you can get both in Match Group."", ""Mary Long: Sounds like an ideal rom-com scenario. The thing with Match Group, it's got about 15.2 million total users to Bumble's, 3.8 across apps. I hear that first thing I think is more people, more options, yes. But also more data. If these apps are using algorithms to run people, Match, that having more people on its collection of apps gives it more data to make successful matches. Is that true? Do we see that massive amount of data that Match Group has access to actually gives its algorithms a leg up? Is there a way to quantify that?"", ""Rick Munarriz: Well, obviously there are scalability advantages. Obviously, the more data you can feed into a platform, the better the potential algorithm and the better the potential outcomes. However, there's also a reason why Match Group has more than three dozen other sites just beyond Tinder being the Walmart or McDonald's of online dating is great, but sometimes folks who want a more specialized experience. Yes, just like Netflix can afford to spend more on content than any other streaming service, because it can divide its CapEx across a much larger base. Match Group has the ability to spend that much more to see what works and what doesn't. Unfortunately, for Match Group and dating apps in general, unlike Netflix, where it can actually see how long you went into a show when you stopped watching a series. Match Group doesn't follow you on your dates. It just matches you up, and that's all it really has. But again, the scalability advantages are definitely there. How much data it has to plug into a algorithm? That remains to be seen. The future is very exciting."", ""Mary Long: How much of this business is marketing? To get people to use, swipe and pay on one of these apps, you have to get them to believe up front that they're going to find their person on this app rather than that one. How closely do you look at each company's marketing spend? Is there a way to measure which company has a better return on that spend?"", ""Rick Munarriz: Yes, so apps, obviously they live and die by how they manage their customer acquisition cost. Match has seen that sales and marketing costs go from 16% of its revenue a year ago to 18% in its latest quarter. Obviously not good when that figure is going up. Bumble on the other hand, its sales and marketing costs went 26 to 24% over the last year. Bumble is obviously higher, but it's trending in the right direction. However, you can't just take marketing cost or customer acquisition cost at face value. Bumble is doing a better job than average revenue per user and you also have to look at the lifetime of a customer. The irony of online dating sites is that if they're really good at what they do and they pair you up with that only person you want to date for the rest of your life, you don't need the app anymore. There's a reason why eHarmony, which is the top app gaze for people looking to find the one instead of the next one is more expensive as a platform because they know once you have that long-term relationship, your relationship with the app is a very short-term relationship. This works in the favor of Tinder or Bumble, that can be largely seen as hookup apps because they are geared more for people that want to date different people without having to get on bended knee or swap apartment keys or anything like that. I think you can spend years on either app and still feel good about yourself and not feel like you're falling short."", 'Mary Long: Match generated $785 million in free cash flow over the trailing 12 months. Management has said over the past two quarters that it intends to return at least 50% of that free cash flow to shareholders. A share buybacks and other means, how do the capital allocation strategies at each company differ?', ""Rick Munarriz: Bumble is similar, well it's smaller and it generated just about $150 million in free cash flow over the last 12 months. Obviously a lot less than Match Group. It has that same capacity where it feels, hey, my stock is down more than 80% from its all time high. It's been undervalued at the current levels and it's not afraid to eat its own cooking. Just as Match Group has no problem buying back its own shares and making that commitment. In November, Bumble doubled their share buyback authorization to $300 million."", ""Deidre Woollard: Bumble's founder, Whitney Wolfe Herd, you mentioned that she stepped away from the company in November of last year, and so Bumble has brought in former Slack CEO Lidiane Jones as Herd's replacement. Match has also had its mix up or its CEO shake up, Faye Iosotaluno was named CEO of Tinder. She's been at Match Group for a while. She's been at Tinder for about 18 months as COO before being named the Chief Executive Role. What are your benchmark exams for each leader? What do you want to have seen them initiated or accomplished in the next year, five years?"", ""Rick Munarriz: There are a lot of new leaders here. Even for Match Group, the parent company, they got a new CEO less than two years ago. Obviously, Tinder, Bumble and Match Group as a whole, all with recent leadership. I think at Bumble the new term goal is pretty straightforward. They need to build on that new found profitability. They've always been a good revenue growth story. Now that they have a little taste of profitability on a reported basis and obviously much healthier on an adjusted basis, can they build on that? Over the next five years the goal has to be the same for both companies. This is that grow the business. A, you have to grow the business. B, you have to grow market share. C, you also have to improve its operating efficiency to the point where the bottom line is even stronger. I guess I didn't get to Match Group's their short term in one year. I think obviously their biggest problem right now, the thing that's scaring people is that their usage growth. The paying users has declined. It's lower than it was a year ago and even lower now than it was two years ago. They need to pick that up because even though the revenue per user is going up, you don't want to be in a situation where you feel that my company is losing market share, my investment is no longer the top dog. I think that it needs to find a way to grow its numbers again, regardless of the math involved."", ""Mary Long: There was a story making the rounds late last year about how more and more people are shunning traditional dating apps and opting more for, I'll use the term tertiary social media sites. They're finding love on Strava and Duolingo, and less so on Hinge say. We talked about struggling new user numbers, etc. Is this emblematic of a shift away from dating apps? How worried should either company be about this? I don't even know if we can call it a trend, but about this story."", ""Rick Munarriz: I hope not, but I don't see it that way. I think a lot of people aren't matching the numbers to the narrative that they want to believe in this case. The pandemic was a scary time obviously, and you might think there wasn't a lot of dating in 2020 when we were sheltering in place for months. But revenue of Match Group and Bumble rose 17% and 18% respectively that year. In 2021 we got vaccinations, businesses open, travel restrictions eased up. Business skyrocketed for both companies, and now we've had two years of back to back decelerating revenue growth at these two companies. I don't think that people are not going to give up on these apps just because they're on a certain app to me. Sure. The ability now that people can go to bars, concerts, festivals, it makes it less necessary to rely on the app to meet someone because you're actually out there in the wild and making connections on your own. But I do think that this is the kind of thing where I can't compare. I'm on Duolingo and I never approach it as the other people in my French Sapphire League are actually like trying to hit on your, vice versa. Just all we have is an affinity to want to learn a foreign language. Or maybe it's just that I've been married 33 years and I don't know what flirting is anymore."", ""Mary Long: The price to sales ratio for each of these companies is relatively similar. Match is trading at about 3.2 times sales, and Bumble, closer to two. Considering that and everything else that we've discussed today, if you can only give your final rose to one of these companies, which has your vote as the better buy?"", ""Rick Munarriz: I'm handling the rose thorns at all knowing that I'll get pricked by the thorns, possibly in the process to bumble. I'm a growth investor and I'll take a disruptive speeder over the established leader if it's gaining market share. Especially now that it's become a Bumble line growth story too. Both stocks are trading. As I mentioned earlier, about 80% from their all time highs. I think both stocks are attracted now. I think both can beat the market. They have challenges, but I think both can beat the market in the next 1, 3 or 5 years. I'll take your pick. I think that's where they all do well. To me, the one red flag that I initially had in Bumble when Whitney Wolfe Herd stepped down in November was, she's gone. This was such a leadership driven company. But the more I just read about it and said, well, she has an amazing story being at the genesis of these two world's largest dating sites, Lidiane came in from leadership roles at Microsoft and Salesforce. She was at Salesforce when they acquired Slack. That's why she became CEO of Slack for a little while and they trusted her with that, and now Bumble gives her the company, hey, take over here. Bumble is no longer playing Cupid. I think it's at the point now where it's now a tech platform with the masses. I think she should do well there. I think Bumble as an investment will do well with the new leadership at this point."", ""Deidre Woollard: As always, people on the program may have interest in the stocks they talk about and the Motley Fool may have formal recommendations for or against, so don't buy or sell stocks based solely on what you hear.

(NASDAQ:FFIV). The company's stock saw a decent share price growth of 18% on the NASDAQGS over the last few months. The company is inching closer to its yearly highs following the recent share price climb. With many analysts covering the large-cap stock, we may expect any price-sensitive announcements have already been factored into the stock’s share price. However, could the stock still be trading at a relatively cheap price? Let’s take a look at F5’s outlook and value based on the most recent financial data to see if the opportunity still exists."", ' View our latest analysis for F5 ', ""Great news for investors – F5 is still trading at a fairly cheap price according to our price multiple model, where we compare the company's price-to-earnings ratio to the industry average. In this instance, we’ve used the price-to-earnings (PE) ratio given that there is not enough information to reliably forecast the stock’s cash flows. we find that F5’s ratio of 23.42x is below its peer average of 30.33x, which indicates the stock is trading at a lower price compared to the Communications industry. However, given that F5’s share is fairly volatile (i.e. its price movements are magnified relative to the rest of the market) this could mean the price can sink lower, giving us another chance to buy in the future. This is based on its high beta, which is a good indicator for share price volatility."", ""Future outlook is an important aspect when you’re looking at buying a stock, especially if you are an investor looking for growth in your portfolio. Although value investors would argue that it’s the intrinsic value relative to the price that matter the most, a more compelling investment thesis would be high growth potential at a cheap price. F5's earnings over the next few years are expected to increase by 50%, indicating a highly optimistic future ahead. This should lead to more robust cash flows, feeding into a higher share value."", 'Are you a shareholder? Since FFIV is currently below the industry PE ratio, it may be a great time to accumulate more of your holdings in the stock. With an optimistic outlook on the horizon, it seems like this growth has not yet been fully factored into the share price. However, there are also other factors such as capital structure to consider, which could explain the current price multiple.', 'Are you a potential investor? If you’ve been keeping an eye on FFIV for a while, now might be the time to enter the stock. Its prosperous future profit outlook isn’t fully reflected in the current share price yet, which means it’s not too late to buy FFIV. But before you make any investment decisions, consider other factors such as the strength of its balance sheet, in order to make a well-informed assessment.', ""Since timing is quite important when it comes to individual stock picking, it's worth taking a look at what those latest analysts forecasts are.

The talks center around developing a potential partnership or joint venture between the companies' streaming services, Paramount+ and Peacock. The talks come as questions swirl about Paramount's future, which includes reports about it being sold to a group of investors being led by SkyDance Media and a buyout offer from billionaire Byron Allen."", ""Yahoo Finance's Alexandra Canal reports the breaking details."", 'For more expert insight and the latest market action, click here to watch this full episode of Yahoo Finance Live.', ""Editor's note: This article was written by Stephanie Mikulich"", '- We have breaking news from the streaming world. According to the ""Wall Street Journal,"" Paramount and Comcast are in talks to join forces in a new streaming venture, adding to the trend of consolidation in the sector. We have our very own Alexandra Canal here with the latest. So these two streaming apps potentially under one roof, what do we know?', 'ALEXANDRA CANAL: Yes. So this is a report from the ""Wall Street Journal."" I reached out to both companies for comment. They have not gotten back to me at this point, but Paramount, it hosts a decent amount of content. We have the ""Taylor Sheridan Universe."" We have ""Star Trek."" And you can also simultaneously watch NFL games that are on CBS on Paramount Plus.', 'Then if you take a look at Peacock, they have shows like ""The Office."" They also have a big live sports presence with soccer and football. So you think that the combination of this would leverage the opportunity for both of these companies to just have more content under their roof in addition to more live sports. And live sports has really been viewed as the last frontier of the streaming wars.', ""This comes on the heels of that joint venture announcement between ESPN, Warner Brothers, Discovery, and Fox. And when this first broke, initially, I thought, OK so this is in response to that. It seems like to me because at the end of the day, there's a lot of debt for these companies, especially when it comes to their streaming ambitions. This could be a way to help with cost savings, but at the same time, Paramount is one of those companies that has been floated around as a potential acquisition target."", ""We've heard Byron Allen has made a bid. Reportedly our parent company Apollo Global is interested, Skydance Media. So there's a lot of interest in Paramount as a company for its assets, for its film business, and even for Paramount Plus."", ""So if you were to combine Peacock with Paramount Plus, I wonder how that could shake up the M&A landscape as well? But we're seeing both of those stocks down right now. The broader market is lower as well, but just interesting to see even more consolidation in the space. And it seems like once again the big driver of this is sports."", ""- Well, you mentioned that the market reaction is a little muted. And it is a down day so far, but I'm curious whether or not this is an indication that the Street is maybe not thrilled about this news, or do you think that it's more just a wait and see if we have more information moving forward? It looks like, again, all of the names that we've been talking about are down today, but 1.8% on relatively good volume for Paramount in the red makes me think that there's something bigger here."", ""ALEXANDRA CANAL: I think there's a wait and see, but I also-- you have to remember, a lot of these companies are legacy media companies, right. So if you focus more energy on sports, you create these joint ventures. And the emphasis is, OK, we want to drive people to watch sports on our streaming platforms, not on linear. That is risky because at the end of the day linear is still profitable, right."", ""It's declining massively within cord cutting, but it's also what's powering a lot of the streaming business. So I think when you have a company like Paramount that has a lot of linear network exposure and they want to drive more people to streaming, that's automatically a red flag to investors. Well, what does that mean for their bottom line moving forward? So I think that's one thing."", ""Another question mark is, what is all this going to cost the consumer, right? We don't know what the ESPN, Warner Brothers, Discovery, Fox, joint venture is going to cost. If we see a combo here, is that going to be an increase in cost?"", ""What does that mean for average revenue per user or ARPU, which is a big profitability metric? So still a lot of unknowns here that I think, investors, they want some clarity on, but 2024 is the year I think that we're going to see some dealmaking in this space or at least set us up for some serious moves in 2025. And clearly, these reports are just the start of that. A great beat for you, Ali."", '- A lot going on, always busy.', '- A busy day.

If you want to skip our detailed discussion about cash hoarding by nonbanking US firms, go to 7 Companies With the Most Cash Reserves.\xa0', 'A recent research by Harvard Business Review revealed that nonbanking US companies have increased their hoards of cash significantly post-pandemic. Traditionally, financial institutions such as banks keep large sums of cash in hand because they are in the business of lending money.\xa0', 'It does not make any apparent sense for nonbanking companies to hoard large piles of cash and collect only interest when cash could be invested for larger profits. According to the latest figures, the total cash reserves of the nonbanking US companies are a whopping $6.9 trillion, nearly equivalent to the GDPs of Germany and India combined. Today, cash represents $1 out of every $5 of total assets held by nonbanking US firms.\xa0', ""As we dig a little deeper, the reasons for keeping cash reserves become clearer. According to analysts, companies are hoarding cash because it helps them avoid premature failures that might decimate shareholder value. It allows them greater investment and operational flexibility. Economies around the world are increasingly becoming knowledge-based. The 'winner-take-all reward' model is quite prevalent in industries around the world. So, nonbanking firms are hoarding cash to utilize now-or-never opportunities.\xa0"", 'Cash also provides a cushion to bridge the timing mismatch between cash generation and sudden cash needs. In simple terms, it gives the firms the flexibility to quickly capitalize on profitable opportunities. However, there is more to this story.\xa0', 'Maintaining and building flexibility to capitalize on profitable opportunities is one side of the coin when it comes to hoarding cash. Higher cash reserves allow the companies to avoid taxes since they can only be collected on profits made by investments. The premise of investing cash in profitable investments rather than collecting only interest does not factor in the tax rate applied to those profits.', 'So, it would only make sense for companies to invest rather than hoard cash if the investment is significantly net positive, including tax. Even if the investment is net positive after taxation but without a significant margin, it makes more sense for companies to keep the cash in hand for a small cost and utilize it when a one-of-a-kind opportunity arises. Then, there is also an exception of firms with subjective valuation. These firms might struggle to access capital quickly, and so keep a large proportion of their assets as cash in hand.\xa0', 'It is quite interesting to note that multinationals whose value is generated primarily by their intellectual property are hoarding cash. Research by the professors at Kellogg School of Management found that reserves of Apple, Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), Alphabet, Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG), and Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) accounted for 92% of cash reserves that they could document. Naturally, all of these are tech companies and are also part of our top tech companies list.\xa0', 'All three companies are extensively involved in research and development. In fact, last year\xa0 Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) held off increasing the salaries of its employees, citing investment in AI as one of the reasons. It is worth noting that two of these companies, Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) and\xa0 Alphabet, Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) are in competition with each other for the development of AI models. Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) has invested heavily in Open AI, whereas Alphabet, Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) has invested in Antropic. It is quite apparent that both companies see the AI revolution as one of a kind opportunity that they want to capitalize on.\xa0', 'In 2018,\xa0 Apple, Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) set an ambitious goal to reach a net cash neutral position where any cash in hand is balanced by its total debt. However, last year, the company took drastic steps to decrease the pile of idle cash it was sitting on. Apple, Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) returned much of the cash to shareholders in the form of share buybacks and dividends.\xa0', 'It is worth noting here that despite all of the cash hoarding by nonbanking US companies, the financial sector and banking institutions have the most cash. This is apparent in our list as an overwhelming majority are financial institutions.\xa0', ""With that backdrop, let's look at the top 20 companies with the most cash reserves.\xa0"", 'A bank teller in a full-service office, counting and organizing cash.', ""For our list of the top \xa020 companies with the most cash reserves, we researched online for companies with significant 'cash on hand' in their balance sheets.

Matt Rosendale, R-Mont.\xa0“I have come to believe that this continuing effort to transform the Oracle Cerner pharmacy software into something completely different is insanity.”', 'The costly project to replace the VA’s legacy health records system, ViSTA,\xa0has been in progress for years; Cerner first scored the modernization contract in 2018, and the company was acquired by technology firm Oracle four years later.', 'But rollout of the new EHR has been rocky, with system reliability and safety concerns plaguing the VA. New deployments were put on hold in April last year to ensure the system is performing up to standards at existing sites.', 'Captain James A. Lovell Federal Health Care Center in North Chicago, Ill., a joint VA and Department of Defense facility, is scheduled to take up the new EHR in early March. Some legislators questioned whether the transition at a larger and more complex facility should go ahead.', '“I understand that the DOD is motivated to finish this deployment. That cannot come at the expense of our veterans or VA providers,” said Rep. Sheila Cherfilus-McCormick, D-Fla. “I hope the VA decision makers are being incredibly deliberative in deciding whether or not the go-live should be allowed to happen as scheduled.”', 'Veterans have experienced inaccurate medication information\xa0when treated at different care sites that use the updated or legacy EHR, according to testimony from David Case, deputy inspector general at the VA.', 'When a veteran receives a prescription at a center using the new EHR, the system sends information to a data repository. If the veteran then goes to another center using the legacy system, a ViSTA program accesses the repository to perform a safety check to ensure there aren’t any allergies and the medication is compatible with other prescribed drugs.', 'But sometimes the information in the data repository is inaccurate, duplicative or simply missing, Case said.', 'The problem, which affected approximately 250,000 veterans as of September 2023, pushed one medical center to increase\xa0its pharmacy staff. Patients also weren’t adequately informed about the risks, he added.', 'The agency is working to communicate with veterans, said Neil Evans, acting program executive director of the EHR modernization integration office at the VA.', ""“I question what other dangerous pharmacy problems have not even been uncovered yet,”\xa0Rosendale said. “What we do know is that the results of the VA and Oracle strategy to improve the EHR have been one step forward and one step backwards. We're not gaining on this.”"", 'The Office of Inspector General\xa0also briefed the subcommittee on scheduling issues with the new EHR. When a provider needs to cancel an appointment, the system moves appointments to the “displaced appointment queue” for rescheduling. But those appointments sometimes disappear from the queue, Case said.', 'One scheduling error resulted in staffers not contacting a patient adequately after missing a mental healthcare appointment, possibly leading to the patient’s death, according to written testimony. The missed appointment wasn’t routed to a “request queue,” and workers weren’t reminded to conduct the required scheduling attempts.', 'The lack of contact may have contributed to the patient’s substance use relapse, the OIG concluded.', 'The new EHR is still on track to deploy at Lovell next month. The Department of Defense already uses the new system, so that could help them successfully complete the transition, Evans said. Plus the medical center is unique, and they currently run into challenges using two EHRs plus custom software to enable interoperability.', 'The hold on deployments has allowed the agency and Oracle to focus on the rollout at Lovell too, and they’ve made a number of functional enhancements to the system, said Mike Sicilia, executive vice president of global industries at Oracle.', '“The other five live sites have had to take these functional enhancements piecemeal because they were already live, and they were already functioning on a system that admittedly, when we took it over, was not stable and was not acceptable,” he said. “So I think their experience has been very different than the experience that Lovell will have as a result.”', 'This story was originally published on Healthcare Dive.

While its quarterly revenues are expected to have witnessed a year-over-year increase, core funds from operations (FFO) per share might display a decline.In the last reported quarter, this self-storage real estate investment trust (REIT) delivered a surprise of 2.85% in terms of core FFO per share. Results reflected a better-than-anticipated top line. The company also benefited from its expansion efforts through acquisitions, developments and extensions.Over the last four quarters, Public Storage surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate on all occasions, the average beat being 2.32%. The graph below depicts the surprise history of the company:', 'Public Storage price-eps-surprise | Public Storage Quote', 'Let’s see how things have shaped up before this announcement.', 'Public Storage is expected to have continued enjoying the advantages of its strong foothold in major urban centers, well-established brand reputation and technological edge in the fourth quarter. Additionally, PSA is likely to have maintained a robust financial position.Public Storage has one of the strongest balance sheets in the sector, with adequate liquidity to bank on expansion opportunities through acquisitions and developments. This is likely to have continued in the fourth quarter as well.From the beginning of 2021 through Sep 30, 2023, the company acquired 459 facilities with 38 million net rentable square feet for $8.3 billion. Particularly, in September 2023, it acquired Simply Self Storage from BREIT for $2.2 billion. Such acquisition and expansion initiatives are anticipated to have stoked the company’s growth during the period under consideration.Amid these, Public Storage is likely to have seen growth in revenues in the quarter to be reported. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for quarterly revenues stands at $1.14 billion. This calls for a 4.53% year-over-year increase.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for fourth-quarter revenues from self-storage facilities stands at $1.065 billion. This suggests an increase from the $1.028 billion witnessed in the year-ago period. Quarterly revenues from ancillary operations are presently projected at $64.03 million, ahead of the $60.19 million registered in the comparable period last year.However, with tenants reverting to more normal move-out behavior as the pandemic’s impact abates, there is upward pressure on vacate trends. This is likely to limit rental rate growth in many markets. Weaker industry-wide demand in a soft macroeconomic environment and more limited home-moving activities are likely to have acted as dampeners.Consequently, same-store revenues are likely to be affected, and we estimate a 3.1% decline in this metric in the fourth quarter. Also, we project 2023 weighted average square foot occupancy to be 93.1%, down from 94.9% recorded at the end of 2022.Also, high interest rates add to its woes. We estimate a significant year-over-year increase in interest expenses in the fourth quarter.PSA’s activities during the quarter under review were not adequate to gain analysts’ confidence. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the fourth-quarter core FFO per share has been revised a cent south to $4.15 in the past month. It also calls for a 0.24% year-over-year decline.For the full year 2023, Public Storage projected core FFO per share in the range of $16.60-$16.85.

This report provides a detailed overview of the company's financial performance and strategic direction. Aon PLC, headquartered in London, operates in over 120 countries and employs approximately 50,000 people. The company's diversified portfolio and global reach have positioned it as a key player in the industry. In 2023, Aon PLC reported consolidated total revenue of $13,376 million, with significant contributions from its Commercial Risk Solutions, Reinsurance Solutions, Health Solutions, and Wealth Solutions segments. This SWOT analysis aims to dissect Aon PLC's internal and external environments to inform investors and stakeholders of its competitive position and future outlook."", 'Warning! GuruFocus has detected 4 Warning Sign with AON.', ""Global Presence and Diversified Portfolio: Aon PLC's operations span across 120 countries, providing stability against economic fluctuations in specific regions. Its diversified business model, with revenue streams from Commercial Risk Solutions, Reinsurance Solutions, Health Solutions, and Wealth Solutions, allows Aon to mitigate risks associated with market volatility. The company's global reach and comprehensive service offerings have enabled it to build a robust client base, ranging from small enterprises to large multinational corporations. This geographical and operational diversity is a significant strength, as it reduces dependency on any single market or segment and provides multiple avenues for growth."", ""Innovative Solutions and Technology Investment: Aon PLC has demonstrated a commitment to innovation, particularly in data analytics and technology. The company's investment in proprietary tools, such as Aon Business Services and advanced analytics platforms, has enhanced its ability to deliver insightful risk assessments and tailored solutions to clients. These technological advancements have not only improved service delivery but also created barriers to entry for competitors, solidifying Aon's market position. The focus on innovation is crucial in an industry that is increasingly driven by data and technology, and Aon's proactive approach positions it well for future growth."", ""Dependence on Economic and Market Conditions: Despite its global presence, Aon PLC's performance is susceptible to macroeconomic factors and market conditions, such as fluctuations in currency exchange rates, interest rates, and global equity markets. These external factors can impact the company's financial condition and results, as evidenced by the potential volatility in its global tax rate due to changing tax regulations. While Aon has taken steps to mitigate these risks, the inherent uncertainty in global markets remains a weakness that can affect its profitability and growth prospects."", ""Operational Risks and Regulatory Compliance: Aon PLC operates in a highly regulated industry, and the complexity of compliance across different jurisdictions poses operational risks. The company's expansive global operations expose it to varying regulatory environments, which can lead to potential legal and financial repercussions if not navigated effectively. Additionally, the company's reliance on complex information technology systems introduces risks related to cybersecurity and data protection. Any significant disruption or breach could damage Aon's reputation and lead to financial losses."", ""Acquisition and Expansion Strategies: Aon PLC's definitive agreement to acquire NFP for approximately $7 billion highlights its strategic expansion efforts. This acquisition is expected to strengthen Aon's market position and expand its service offerings, creating opportunities for revenue growth and operational synergies. The company's ability to identify and integrate acquisitions successfully can be a significant driver of future success, allowing Aon to enter new markets and offer additional services to its clients."", ""Emerging Markets and Innovation: The increasing demand for insurance and risk management solutions in emerging markets presents a substantial opportunity for Aon PLC. By leveraging its global network and expertise, Aon can capture market share in these rapidly growing regions. Furthermore, the company's focus on innovation and technology can lead to the development of new products and services, addressing unmet client needs and staying ahead of industry trends. Aon's commitment to innovation can also foster partnerships and collaborations, further enhancing its competitive edge."", ""Intense Competition and Market Disruption: Aon PLC faces significant competition from both traditional insurance brokers and new entrants leveraging technology to disrupt the market. The rise of insurtech startups and alternative risk transfer solutions poses a threat to Aon's traditional business model. Competitors may innovate more rapidly or offer more cost-effective services, challenging Aon's market share. To maintain its competitive position, Aon must continue to invest in innovation and adapt to changing market dynamics."", ""Regulatory Changes and Legal Risks: The insurance and reinsurance industry is subject to stringent and ever-evolving regulations. Changes in laws or regulations, or their interpretation, can lead to increased compliance costs and potential legal challenges for Aon PLC. Additionally, the company is exposed to various legal proceedings and contingencies that could result in significant financial liabilities. Navigating these legal and regulatory landscapes requires constant vigilance and adaptability, which can strain resources and impact Aon's operations."", ""In conclusion, Aon PLC's SWOT analysis reveals a company with a strong global presence, diversified portfolio, and a focus on innovation, positioned well to capitalize on growth opportunities. However, it must navigate economic sensitivities, operational risks, and intense competition to maintain its market leadership. Aon's strategic acquisitions and expansion into emerging markets, coupled with its investment in technology, present pathways for continued success.

(Operator Instructions) As a reminder, this conference is being recorded today, February 16, 2024.I would now like to turn the call over to Shane Kleinstein, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.', 'Shane Kleinstein', ""Thank you. Before we begin, we'd like to remind everyone that this call includes certain forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Actual events or results could differ materially due to a number of risks and uncertainties, including those mentioned in the most recent Forms 10-K filed by Liberty Broadband and Liberty TripAdvisor with the SEC. These forward-looking statements speak only as of the date of this call, and Liberty Broadband and Liberty TripAdvisor expressly disclaim any obligation or undertaking to disseminate any updates or revisions to any forward-looking statements contained herein to reflect any change in Liberty Broadband or Liberty TripAdvisor's expectations with regard thereto or any change in events, conditions or circumstances on which any such statement is based.On today's call, we will discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures for Liberty Broadband, including adjusted OIBDA. Information regarding the comparable GAAP metrics, along with the required definitions and reconciliations, including preliminary note and Schedules 1 and 2, can be found in the earnings press release issued today as well as earnings releases for prior periods, which are available on Liberty Broadband's website.Now I'd like to turn the call over to Greg Maffei, Liberty's President and CEO."", 'Gregory B. Maffei', ""Thank you, Shane, and good morning. Today speaking on the call, we will have also Liberty Broadband's Chief Accounting Officer and Principal Financial Officer, Brian Wendling; Ron Duncan, CEO of GCI; and Pete Pounds of GCI will also be available to answer questions. During Q&A, we will also be available to answer questions related to Liberty TripAdvisor.So I'm going to begin with Liberty Broadband. We resumed repurchases of our Liberty Broadband shares using proceeds from the Charter share repurchases sales in October. From the 1st of November to the end of January, we repurchased $385 million of proceeds -- received $385 million of proceeds from Charter sales and spent $255 million on LBRD repurchases.Similar to last year, under our 25 -- 26% fully diluted ownership cap, the early 2024 grants that Charter made slowed down their repurchases or our requirements to be repurchased. And therefore, we do not expect to sell into the Charter back -- buyback in the next few months. Once we exceed the cap of 26%, we plan to resume the LBRD buyback.Looking at Charter itself, we certainly acknowledge there were near-term headwinds in the quarter, which impacted broadband unit growth. The fourth quarter was also -- felt a delayed impact from the Disney dispute at the end of the third quarter. There's been a consistent trend in 2023 of increased competition from fixed wireless, but we do believe the competitive noise will lessen over time.Fixed wireless assets will have capacity issues over the long term, and the operators have been clear on their limitations. And we do believe that bandwidth demands will continue to increase among consumers, which will favor higher speeds.We are long-term shareholders. We are confident the strategic investments that Charter is making will generate excellent returns and accelerate growth over the next few periods. Charter assets will provide the highest speed and the converged of -- of a converged offering at the most competitive prices for consumers.Spectrum One is continuing to drive mobile growth and reducing churn. Charter was able to add 2.5 million mobile line net adds during 2023. That's a nearly 50% growth over the prior year. And we saw no uptick in churn from the initial cohorts who are rolling off the promotional periods in the fourth quarter.As you would expect, the Internet-plus-mobile customers are stickier than Internet-only customers. Another positive news, the rural expansion is beating penetration, ARPU and ROI targets. The network evolution at Charter remains on course with fast, low-cost upgrades at about $100 per passing. We don't believe competitors can replicate that upgrade path over their footprint. As management has outlined, the long-term CapEx outlook excluding BEAD is expected to materially step down from 2027 to normalized levels.Let me touch on Liberty Trip. We filed an amendment to our 13D. We were authorized by the Board to engage in acquisition discussions, and we will not comment further on those discussions unless definitive documents are executed or the discussions are terminated.Looking at TripAdvisor itself. TripAdvisor had a strong 2023 operating results, particularly in the back half. Q4 revenue was up 10% over the prior year. Q4 EBITDA and margin expansion exceeded expectations. There was outperformance at the recently renamed brand, TripAdvisor. The Viator break-even profitability was reached earlier than anticipated. And there were marketing efficiencies at brand TripAdvisor and Viator that allowed us to have better-than-expected performance. And we continue to move on cost-saving actions, which are improving margins.We've seen great successful diversification of the revenue at TripAdvisor with the Viator and TheFork nearly being 50% of 2023 revenue. In comparison, they were less than 10% in 2015. And its experiences are now half -- almost half the level of brand TripAdvisor.We've also seen increased repeat rates among customers. For example, at Viator, the Q4 gross booking value from repeat customers exceeded new travelers for the first time. Management is focused on long-term strategic opportunities and GenAI-driven product enhancements like TRIP tools to drive engagement and growth, and we think we are optimistic about those results.And with that, I'll turn it over to Brian to discuss the financials."", 'Brian J. Wendling', ""Thank you, Greg. At quarter end, Liberty Broadband had consolidated cash and cash equivalents of $158 million, which includes $79 million of cash at GCI. The value of our Charter investment based on our shares held as of February 1 and Charter share price as of yesterday's close was $13.5 billion.At quarter end, Liberty Broadband had a total principal amount of debt of $3.8 billion. Note that this excludes the preferred stock.We are updating our annual tax rate guidance on our Charter sales for 2024 to low double digits. This conservatively assumes the DRD, the dividend received deduction, does not apply to charter sales for the book minimum tax under the Inflation Reduction Act. We are accruing for this higher tax rate in 2024, while additional guidance from the IRS and treasury is pending.I note that any book minimum tax paid for 2024 will carry forward to offset regular income tax in future years to the extent regular income tax exceeds the book minimum tax, making this more of a timing impact. Consistent with prior years, we're not providing specific tax guidance beyond the current year.Looking at GCI, 2023 was a good year for the company with record revenue and adjusted OIBDA. GCI generated solid free cash flow and distributed $65 million of dividends to Liberty Broadband during the year. For the full year, revenue and adjusted OIBDA grew 1% to $931 million and $361 million, respectively, driven by the strong performance in business data revenue, offset by declines in other revenue, primarily video and voice. In the fourth quarter, revenue was flat and adjusted OIBDA decreased 1%. While we continue to see strong business data growth, this was offset by declines in other revenue and increased costs primarily in SG&A.Operationally, GCI added 1,400 consumer cable modem subscribers and 4,800 consumer wireless customers in 2023. GCI's leverage as defined in its credit agreement was 2.9x at year-end, and GCI has $397 million of undrawn capacity under its revolver. We'd note that subsequent to year-end, GCI paid down an incremental $40 million under its revolving credit facility.In 2023, GCI spent $216 million on capital expenditures net of proceeds received from federal and state grant funding. This is above prior expectations largely due to the timing of receiving certain grant proceeds. GCI's net capital expenditures for 2024 are expected to be approximately 200 million related to additional high-returning investments in middle- and last-mile connectivity with continued network expansion in our most important markets in rural Alaska, including Bethel and the AU-Aleutians fiber projects. Taking a proactive approach in rural connectivity projects is critical to securing necessary government funding.And with that, I'll turn call back over to Greg."", 'Gregory B. Maffei', ""Thank you, Brian. And to our listening audience, we appreciate your continued interest in Liberty Broadband and Liberty TripAdvisor.And with that, operator, I'd like to open the line for questions."", 'Operator', '(Operator Instructions) Our first questions come from the line of Michael Rollins with Citi.', 'Michael Ian Rollins', ""Two questions. First, what are your expectations as to whether or not the ACP program will be discontinued? And can you share your thoughts on the possible implications for each of GCI and Charter?And then secondly, just given the comments on being a long-term investor in Charter, does the current price for Charter change Liberty's interest to sell shares into Charter's buyback when needed to stay under the 26% cap?"", 'Gregory B. Maffei', ""Thank you for the question. I'll address ACP and the impact to Charter, my expectations. And then, Ron, maybe you'd like to talk about ACP and potential impact to GCI. And then I'll come back and talk about buyback.So whether ACP will be renewed or not is certainly a guess into the wooly world of Washington. There is an enormous amount of support for it among many congressmen and senators, to our knowledge, and many of them are in red states, which actually received a majority of the ACP proceeds. So there is some reason for optimism, but trying to assume that there is a path forward that is clearing crisp in Washington is something that's beyond my capabilities.The impact, a little unknown. Many of the ACP customers at Charter were customers prior to the ACP program. We think the demand for bandwidth, the requirements that customers have for bandwidth have only -- have grown. One of the complaints among some people in Washington is that this is a subsidy program, which isn't necessary because customers want the bandwidth. And that is a reason why some may not vote against it. That, of course, is not -- it's helpful for us in getting -- securing ACP funding, but it may also be correct that it indicates most customers will continue to take our broadband even in the absence of ACP. So it's hard to speculate on how much impact eliminating ACP would have or the cessation of ACP would have, but it's clearly not a positive on the margin.Ron, would you want to add anything?"", 'Ronald A. Duncan', ""Just briefly, we're expecting minimal impact from an ACP discontinuance at GCI. Most of the customers on ACP were broadband customers to begin with. And we have budgeted a slight increase in bad debt and anticipate probably a little bit of an uptick in churn. I think ACP for us was doing more to reduce the churn ratio among customers who may struggle from build to bill.But at the end of the day, I doubt that the effect of the ACP shift will be perceptible on the broadband side. I do believe there's an upside opportunity on wireless because nationwide, half of ACP goes to wireless providers. And with our GCI-plus offering in the market being hugely less expensive than the less -- than the least expensive AT&T and Verizon wireless offerings, the disappearance of ACP for wireless should create a competitive opportunity for us to grow wireless subs at the expense of AT&T and Verizon as they phase their customers off of ACP. So we see more positive coming out of it from the wireless side and expect very little impact on the wired side."", 'Gregory B. Maffei', ""I'd just add on that, that all those statements about wireless and the impact are likely to have the same impact or affected Charter with how we're pushing our Spectrum One program.On the buyback issue, I think it's the case, we believe, Charter's long-term interest in -- and the question about whether to raise -- seek to raise the cap or continue and therefore not sell in shares to Charter or continue to buy back at our own on the LBRD, I think, look, you see us spending the majority of proceeds from Charter on LBRD repurchases. We've also seen some amount of debt reduction at LBRD use of the capital for that.And the reality is because we're buying at a substantial discount to the LBRD price -- via the LBRD price to the underlying Charter, we still have the same set of incentives to use our capital for share repurchase and LBRD rather than raise the cap today because the discount is so much larger than the tax leakage. So I'm not sure it actually changes our program."", 'Operator', 'Our next questions come from the line of Barton Crockett with Rosenblatt Securities.', 'Barton Evans Crockett', ""I guess 2 things. One, just kind of a big picture for Greg and then another kind of nuts and bolts on numbers. The bigger-picture question, Greg, is I was curious about your thought on some of the new skinny bundles or streaming bundles that are emerging from the media companies in terms of the legality or the appropriateness in an antitrust perspective. So specifically, the skinny sports bundle from Disney, Warner Bro.s, Fox, do you believe that Charter would have rights to offer the same kind of bundle or not? And do you think there's any kind of antitrust questions there?Similarly, I guess there are some reports that Comcast and Paramount have been discussing perhaps combining streaming efforts. And their streaming services include a lot of content from the broadcast networks, NBC, CBS. There's a prohibition at the FCC on dual network ownership and some antitrust, I think, questions about the video market there. So how do you feel about antitrust? And do you think that ends up being an issue that affects this? So that's kind of the big-picture question. And then I'll come back later with just a small numbers question."", 'Gregory B. Maffei', ""Okay, Barton. I'm only good on the big picture. So thank you for starting with that. The skinny bundles, I'm not sure how skinny that bundle is. But -- and I'm also uncertain about the antitrust implications. I've heard knowledgeable observers on both sides opine. And I really -- and I've not dug into it enough to have a firm view of my own.The question about Charter, I think there is potentially an opportunity for -- as bundles are created that we are a distributor of that and as long-term positive than -- that we're making margin without risk. And we are continuing to drive demand for broadband as those packages shift. So I think in the -- while it's -- we certainly have not seen all of it at Charter and made a full evaluation of where it will go. On the margin, it feels positive to me both as an economic opportunity and as something which drives broadband."", 'Barton Evans Crockett', ""Okay. Great. And then just a numbers question. I wanted to make sure I'm clear. When you say $200 million on CapEx this year, is that comparable to the $216 million? Or is that just on the expansion and the actual comparable number would be something different? There's that. And then your commentary on the tax rate for sales of Charter shares. Just -- I mean, can you give us just like a number? I'm not sure I quite followed what I should assume for a tax rate there."", 'Brian J. Wendling', 'Yes. On the tax...', 'Gregory B. Maffei', 'Brian or Ron -- yes, go ahead, Brian. Thank you.', 'Brian J. Wendling', ""That's right. We're just giving you low double digits at this point, Barton. And then on the CapEx, yes, it's a comparable number, the $200 million to the $216 million."", 'Operator', 'Our next questions come from the line of Ben Swinburne with Morgan Stanley.', 'Benjamin Daniel Swinburne', 'I think these are big picture, so I think for you.', 'Gregory B. Maffei', ""Don't scare me with those details. Come on, Ben. Thank you."", 'Benjamin Daniel Swinburne', ""I ask you the question I asked John back in November on Charter, which is why is 4.5x still the right leverage level. I think I know what your answer is, but obviously, the market has spoken, at least for now, on where they -- what they're thinking on Charter stock. So I'd be curious if there's a scenario where you think lower leverage is actually optimal.And then looking back on the Disney dispute, and you mentioned it in your prepared remarks that that's weighed on subs. Do you think that the objectives and the sort of what was extracted from that agreement by Charter has been worth some of the disruption in the business? And again, broadband net adds have an outsized impact on Charter stock versus their video business. So just wondering how you reflect on that."", 'Gregory B. Maffei', ""Well, I'll start with the -- obviously, with the leverage part. The question is, certainly, we have some shareholders asking the question, and we're weighing the relative merits. But we have at -- the Charter management team has shown the Board, I think, multiple scenarios about what lower leverage or high leverage might mean. And for the moment, we're pretty confident that right in the course given the diversity of maturities, the length of maturities, the likely movement in interest rates that even under most scenarios, we're better off holding the 4.5x leverage.It's certainly a question that's open in the sense that we are responsive to our shareholders in general. I think the -- I can say for the 26% holder and I think probably -- not speaking for them, but correctly relaying their views for the 12% holder of advance in house. I think we're in agreement with management's proposal that 4.5% the right number. But we certainly look at it.And to the degree that there was massive pushback from shareholders you would want to pay attention, I don't think we've received that yet. I think we've received questions on the margin. And I think what's happened to the stock price is not a function. It may be exacerbated by the leverage, but it's a function of perception of broadband growth and how we're doing competitively in the marketplace rather than net leverage.Disney, look, I -- it's a long-term bet. It's a long-term play rather than just whether we feel that impacting a quarter or rolling -- bleeding into the second quarter on how to have a stable video business where we are more aligned and partnered with people like Disney. And I think you can make the same argument as we get to the sports bundle. But having that -- if it occurs or when it occurs, having ourselves align with them, having a role where we can be a distributor of that and having a role in these over-the-top offerings is the right strategy for the long term. And I think management still stands by that view, and I think we're on the same page."", 'Operator', 'Our next questions come from the line of Alex Nordhagen with Balyasny.', 'Alexander Nordhagen', ""I had 2 really around the cap stack. But on the first one, with the 20.51s, the half coupon, obviously, coupon that are put on callable from March '25, what is the kind of base case plan to deal with those, assuming that there isn't any sort of transaction? I would think you'd need to have a plan in place given the low cash balance at Liberty Trip right now. And then the second question I had was just in theory, if with respect to any acquisition discussions Certares was involved, would that need to be disclosed to the market or not?"", 'Gregory B. Maffei', ""Ben, are you there? Do you want to touch on the -- our plans. I think we're evaluating. We're not going to go reveal all. But Ben, what would you want to add?"", 'Ben Oren', ""Yes. I think we monitor it regularly, Alex. We think about what the different strategies are for addressing either a repayment of those securities or an extension of maturity. But we're probably not going to go into detail at this time."", 'Gregory B. Maffei', ""And on -- I think I said I wouldn't comment any further, but I'll just say I think the disclosure we made about being approached is the only disclosure we'll make until we comment further and whether or not with Certares or anybody else who made the offer is really beyond what we're going to reveal today and what we're obligated, we think, under the 13D disclosure rules."", 'Alexander Nordhagen', 'Okay. And if I may just ask a follow-up then. With the depressed stock being callable from next month, 6 weeks away, do you have any intention to call it?', 'Gregory B. Maffei', ""I think I'd refer to Ben's comments earlier. We're evaluating all these things. We're looking at all our alternatives. But until and such time as we make that move, we are not going to -- if we do, we would not -- we're not going to disclose our intention."", 'Alexander Nordhagen', 'All right. Appreciate that.', 'Gregory B. Maffei', 'Sorry to be unsatisfying, but at least I know you tried.', 'Operator', 'Our last question will come from the line of Barton Crockett with Rosenblatt Securities.', 'Barton Evans Crockett', ""So I took the opportunity to come back. Greg, just -- hopefully, this qualifies as big picture just for you. Just curious, the statement that fixed wireless is competitive now but won't be over the longer term. Can you -- do you have any kind of sense in your mind of how long it is before fixed wireless ceases to become competitive and becomes more kind of a source of win back for cable. I say that just thinking that there's a lot of consumers out there that are feeling pretty stretched and I think would be pretty sticky for a low-price service, but there's technical constraints. So what do you think is the timing here?"", 'Gregory B. Maffei', ""Barton, I think I would -- the way you initially stated the premise that fixed wireless isn't competitive, I would say that differently. I would say that there are certainly customers for home fixed wireless is the answer they believe they need. I think that customer set will be reduced over time as broadband demands grow and potentially as FWA becomes less interesting as that network has more users and performance is less attractive or less performant.So I'm not saying it's a binary thing. I'm thinking it's a relative thing. It's the relative attractiveness and the relative need for increased bandwidth, relative attractiveness of that network and the relative needs among consumers for more bandwidth. I think those shift in our favor over time.And then the question of when capacity is constrained, I mean, T-Mobile has been pretty clear about what -- how many they're willing to go out with, and you can judge how quickly it is. Verizon has been less clear. I would argue, Verizon has been less clear about a lot of their plans in this space. But if you look at what reasonable expectations on what the run rate is, you could make your own judgment about when that starts to slow down. We've already seen it slow a little, and we've already seen T-Mo on the margin begin to increase prices for FWA, which seems to suggest that they're not that limitation, but they're recognizing that there's not an unlimited amount of capacity for FWA.I believe that is our last question today. Thank you all for joining. Thank you all for your interest in Liberty Broadband and Liberty TripAdvisor. And with that, operator, we will end today's call."", 'Operator', ""Thank you. This does conclude today's teleconference. We appreciate your participation. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Enjoy the rest of your day.""]"

Welcome to the Tripadvisor Fourth Quarter 2023 Conference Call. [Operator Instructions]. Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded. I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, Angela White, VP of IR."", ""Angela White: Thank you, Josh. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to Tripadvisor's Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2023 Financial Results Call. Joining me today are Matt Goldberg, President and CEO; and Mike Noonan, CFO. Last night after market close, we filed and made available our earnings release. In that release, you'll find reconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures to the most comparable GAAP measure discussed on this call. Before we begin, I'd like to remind you that this call may contain estimates and other forward-looking statements that represent management's views as of today, February 15, 2024. The Tripadvisor disclaims any obligation to update these statements to reflect future events or circumstances. Please refer to our earnings release as well as our filings with the SEC for information concerning factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from these forward-looking statements. With that, I'll turn the call over to Matt."", ""Matthew Goldberg: Thanks, Angela, and good morning, everyone. Before I begin, I'd like to address the press release we filed on Monday. We announced that our Board of Directors has formed a special committee to evaluate any proposals resulting from Liberty Tripadvisor Holdings' stated intention to engage in discussions with respect to a potential transaction. We appreciate your understanding that we won't address any questions on this topic today or provide further updates unless we have something definitive to share. Now I'd like to address our performance. We were pleased to exit the year with results that exceeded our expectations. Q4 revenue was $390 million, reflecting year-over-year growth of 10%. Q4 adjusted EBITDA was $84 million, 22% of revenue, exceeding expectations due to revenue outperformance at brand Tripadvisor and marketing efficiencies at both Brand Tripadvisor and Viator."", 'For the full year, consolidated revenue grew by 20% to an all-time high of $1.8 billion and adjusted EBITDA grew 13% to $334 million. Last year, we made meaningful progress executing against our strategic priorities. We reinforced our market leadership position at Viator while sharpening our focus on smart user acquisition. Viator also finished the year at breakeven profitability, achieving the full year milestone a year earlier than anticipated. At Brand Tripadvisor, we invested in our strategy and delivered promising early proof points while maintaining financial discipline. Finally, at the fork, we delivered revenue gains while significantly improving our profit margin through disciplined cost management and exited the year at breakeven for Q4.', ""Our results also reflect how we're building a stronger, more diversified and defensible position in the large and growing global travel and experiences industry. We have a unique and leading position in the high-growth experiences category, given the breadth of Tripadvisor and the depth of Viator. Within brand Tripadvisor experiences, along with other partner offerings beyond our legacy Hotel meta offering, are now contributing almost half of the revenue versus less than 1/3 in 2015, reflecting our ability to diversify our monetization and reduce dependence on Hotel Meta revenue. And across the group portfolio, Viator and TheFork have grown to nearly 50% of our revenue in 2023 versus less than 10% in 2015. And they've each reached the scale to deliver increasing profitability."", ""Let me highlight our accomplishments and look ahead to 2024 priorities for each segment. At Brand Tripadvisor, we kicked off 2023 and by introducing a multiyear strategic vision that focuses on delivering world-class guidance products to deepen engagement with our audience and fuel diverse monetization paths. Over the course of the year, we delivered tangible progress through product innovation. We relaunched our Trips tool for creating itineraries and integrated generative AI deeply into the user experience. I previously cited a few proof points that demonstrate the impact and we're pleased that each of these has continued to improve over time. First, the average revenue per Trips user shortly after launch was 3x higher than the average member."", ""That has now increased to closer to 5x and our average member already monetizes at approximately 10x the rate of the average nonmember. Second, we saw a 100% increase in the number of daily users who generated and saved an itinerary, specifically with AI in the back half of the year with limited marketing efforts and the majority are now engaging with this tool in our app. Finally, we continue to see growth in the return rates for Trip users whose repeat rates are meaningfully higher than users who don't use the tool. During the year, we also introduced generative AI-driven hotel review summaries, an important example of how we're uniquely positioned to use technology to draw differentiated insights from our proprietary database of quality content and behavioral data."", ""Across the 30,000-plus hotels where this is currently available, we're seeing early but strong positive indicators. User satisfaction scores are nearly 75%, which is even higher than the strong initial scores for our Trips feature at launch. We continue to bring more travelers to our Experiences pages. In 2023, 180 million more travelers used Tripadvisor to shop for Experiences than in 2022. As a result, we drove revenue growth rates higher than any other category in the segment at approximately 45%. Importantly, this strong demand reflects the opportunity we have to match additional supply, adding relevant new inventory and partners across geographies and categories, representing meaningful upside for Experiences on Tripadvisor. 2024 will be a year of acceleration for brand Tripadvisor."", ""Here are a few of our priorities. First, we'll deliver a differentiated experience in the mobile app. To put it simply, our existing app users are more engaged and more valuable than users on other services -- surfaces. They account for a relatively small percent of our total MAUs, but a disproportionate number of reviews and trips created at 30% and over 60%, respectively. Our aim is to deliver an essential app for travelers that convinces more of our audience to download and use the app as the best end-to-end trip companion powered by AI. Second, will begin to shift our marketing in support of our engagement-led strategy. Historically, we've optimized everything from our paid search spend to CRM to drive immediate click and display led revenue."", ""With the progress we've made against our product, we now have the opportunity to target higher-value audiences more directly and drive more users to sign up and sign in as members to download our app and to begin planning a trip because we know each of these behaviors is orders of magnitude more valuable to us than same-session clicks. Finally, we'll leverage the investments we've made in data and AI to deliver a more personalized experience for our users, particularly our highly engaged members. This starts with recognizing them for their contributions to our community and extends to broader benefits and rewards we can offer through our free membership program. It also includes new ways to engage with our product, including on AI-driven conversational search experience and iterative Trip planning capabilities that better integrate commerce opportunities by helping travelers find the right hotel, experience or restaurant to round out their itinerary."", 'Next, at Viator, in 2023, we made significant progress to reinforce our leadership position in experiences by investing and improving our product for both travelers and operators and continuing to drive our scale. This year was an impressive year of revenue growth at 49%, bringing Viator revenue to 41% of total group revenue. GBV grew to over 40% to more than $3.7 billion, and we also reached breakeven profitability for the full year earlier than anticipated. This milestone reflects the power of the model and the operating cost leverage our lean fixed cost structure affords. On the demand side, we optimized our brand campaign, growing our awareness and reinforcing our position as the most well-known experiences brand in the U.S. We made improvements across nearly every part of the shopping experience on every surface.', ""We've enhanced our sort for better discoverability, matured the app and grew its share of bookings and improved the post-booking experience across the board. These and other updates contributed to double-digit growth in conversion across the business. Our new rewards program, meanwhile, is driving value for customers. The early proof points drove mid-teens improvement in retention for travelers using the program. And our most loyal users are our fastest-growing customer segment. They're more likely to come through unpaid and immediately profitable channels and spend more than first-time users, driving improvement in our unit economics. For operators, we launched our latest version of the marketing program, Accelerate. We consulted more than 5,000 operators in its creation, and this consideration shows in the results."", 'Well over 50% of eligible products participate in the program, which contributes -- which continues to support our healthy take rate. With the largest product inventory and supply base available anywhere, the value we are driving for operators is clear. Churn rates are low and supplier and product counts are steadily increasing. In Viator, in 2024, we remain focused on growing our scale, balancing growth, profitability and market share as the global market leader in experiences. With an eye on profitable growth, we expect to drive improvements in unit economics through a combination of initiatives focused on lowering customer acquisition costs, increasing retention and enhancing lifetime value. On the demand side, our focus is on an improved experience along the customer journey from first-time interaction to long-standing returning customers.', ""These are unique experiences for most travelers, so it's important that at first interaction, we begin to build our relationship of trust and value so they return back to book their next memorable experience. We'll do this by leveraging our group customer data platform and delivering a more robust personalized experience for travelers. We'll also continue to focus on enhancing our app value proposition. We know that app users convert to bookers at a rate higher than desktop or mobile web users, so we'll continue to emphasize app engagement opportunities. We'll also continue to optimize marketing spend and our overall channel strategy, focused on acquiring the highest intent customers and continuing to drive awareness. We expect to see improvement in unit economics as our multichannel marketing investments gain traction."", ""On the operator side, we'll continue to drive value through programs aimed at helping operators increase their exposure through features such as incremental performance tracking and insights. The combination of work to enhance the experience for both sides of the marketplace should help operators continue to see value and remain loyal over time. Finally, at TheFork in 2023, we began the transition to deliver profitable growth, leveraging past investments and improving our unit economics while maintaining our leadership position in dining in Europe. We grew revenue 19% in constant currency and also delivered significant margin improvement of 22 percentage points, a swing of $25 million in EBITDA as a result of disciplined cost management. During 2023, we continue to rationalize our footprint to focus on priority European markets, modernized our technology platform to drive speed of product innovation and launch new products and services for both diners and restaurant partners."", ""The team shipped more features in the last 6 months than they had in the previous 6 years, resulting in a stronger value proposition for both sides of the marketplace. For diners, we focused on improving the app user experience, resulting in higher conversion rates, where 75% of our bookings are made. For restaurants, we stabilized churn and drove more than 20% growth in B2B revenue and new restaurant signatures by migrating our ERB to a single platform, introducing new features for payments and yield management and improving our sales efficiency. At TheFork, in 2024, we'll continue to make steady transition to annual profitable growth by focusing on our largest opportunity markets, marketing efficiency, sales productivity and product-led innovation."", ""We'll evolve our marketing strategy to increase our efforts around repeat diners while taking a measured approach to brand investments in prioritized markets. For diners, we will focus on driving app-based engagement and conversion through quality content, personalization, recommendations and incentives to return. For restaurants, we'll focus on value-add ERB features, value-based pricing options, revenue management features and the ability to market special offers to our growing base of high-intent diners. We expect our combined initiatives to drive growth in our average revenue per restaurant and continue to improve our unit economics as we leverage the benefit of a streamlined cost base. To close, we're motivated by our progress in 2023, and we believe that our strategies are delivering results."", ""In 2024, we'll continue to pursue a disciplined financial profile with investment for longer-term growth and transformation across the portfolio. We believe that travel has a sustainable long-term growth path ahead. In 2023, we saw healthy underlying demand despite the backdrop of macro uncertainty, which is testament to consumers prioritizing travel over other discretionary categories. Our traveler surveys reflect steady travel and spending intent in 2024 with a focus on Experiences as a central component. We believe this puts TripAdvisor Group in an advantaged position as we build on our vision to be the world's most trusted source for travel and experiences. And now I'll turn the call over to Mike."", ""Michael Noonan: Thank you, Matt, and good morning, everyone. I'll start by reviewing our Q4 and full year 2023 performance, and then I'll provide high-level thoughts on 2024. All growth rates for 2023 are relative to the comparable period in 2022, unless otherwise indicated. Q4 consolidated revenue was $390 million, reflecting growth of 10% or 8% on a constant currency basis. Adjusted EBITDA was $84 million or 22% of revenue and 10 percentage points higher than last year. Consolidated performance was higher than our expectations, primarily due to a more favorable traffic mix at brand Tripadvisor and disciplined marketing spend at Viator. Turning to segment performance for the quarter, brand Tripadvisor delivered revenue of $218 million, approximately flat year-over-year."", 'Revenue in branded hotels was $135 million, a decline of 4%, driven by a low single-digit decline in Hotel Meta and flat to slightly down performance in Hotel B2B. Hotel Meta performance was driven by sustained pricing strength in both free and paid channels, which was offset by lower click volumes, primarily in paid channels as we continue to manage these channels for profitability by maintaining consistent ROAS targets. From a revenue perspective, growth in Hotel Meta in the U.S. and Rest of World was flat to slightly up, while EMEA declined in line with prior quarters. Importantly, revenue from free channels remained stable. As a result, Hotel Meta contribution profit margin was slightly higher year-over-year. Media and advertising revenue grew 6% to $35 million.', 'Growth in the quarter was more normalized, but a sequential step-down that we expected, primarily due to the recovery pattern in the broader media and advertising sector. Experiences and Dining revenue grew 12% to $38 million, with experiences revenue growing approximately 20% in the midst of a challenging macro environment. Dining revenue slightly declined as we continued realigning our sales model in our B2B business as discussed on our last call. Other revenue was flat year-over-year at $10 million. Growth in crews was 10% in the quarter, offset by sustained revenue pressure in our remaining category offerings due to our strategic deemphasis. Adjusted EBITDA in the brand Tripadvisor segment was $69 million or 32% of revenue. Adjusted EBITDA margin improved by approximately 325 bps year-over-year due to strong revenue performance in our free channels as well as leverage in headcount and other fixed costs.', 'Turning now to Viator. Q4 revenue was $161 million, reflecting growth of 27% or 25% on a constant currency basis. Gross booking value, or GBV, grew 20% to approximately $720 million, driven primarily by volume growth. The GBV and booking growth performance in the quarter was impacted by the onset of the Middle East conflict and its effects in other European destinations where travel advisory warnings were issued. We also drove some marketing efficiencies in the quarter that impacted GBV and booking growth. In Q4, GBV growth from repeat travelers substantially outpaced GBV growth from new travelers. Compared to our new travelers, our repeat travelers book more items per trip, they buy more expensive products, and they have higher propensity to repeat with us, all of which gives us growing confidence that our efforts increasing scale and growing travel lifetime value are working.', ""We will also continue to focus on acquiring large new traveler cohorts given the attractive size of the market opportunity and our track record of converting new travelers to repeat travelers over time. We will do so with a disciplined approach, responding to the quality of traffic we observe and remain flexible as we move through the year. Adjusted EBITDA at Viator is $15 million or 9% of revenue, a significant margin improvement year-over-year largely due to the profitability of flow-through from the aforementioned GBV mix in the quarter. As we have discussed in prior calls, Viator's profitability is impacted by the size and mix of new traveler acquisition. As future growth becomes increasingly driven by repeat bookers, we expect to see attractive and sustainable margin flow-through driven by these large and growing repeat cohorts."", 'At TheFork, Q4 revenue was $39 million, reflecting growth of 18% and 10% on a constant currency basis. Revenue growth was driven by a balanced mix of both volume and pricing. Adjusted EBITDA was breakeven in the quarter, an improvement of $15 million year-over-year, which was driven by continued focus on improving unit economics on both the supply and demand side of the marketplace and prudent cost control. We are very pleased with the work the teams have done over the year to position this segment for profitable growth in 2024. Now turning to consolidated expenses for the quarter. Cost of revenue delevered modestly due to increased direct costs related to certain media campaigns and cloud migration-related expenses at brand Tripadvisor as well as the increased mix of Viator related costs as a percent of consolidated revenues.', 'Sales and marketing costs as a percent of revenue were approximately 900 basis points lower, driven by more efficient marketing spend across each brand, most notably at brand Tripadvisor and TheFork as well as lower people costs across the brands. Technology and content costs as a percent of revenue were flat as investments in data and engineering resources in brand Tripadvisor and Viator remained in line with revenue growth. G&A expenses as a percent of revenue were approximately 400 basis points lower as a result of the cost savings actions we implemented at brand Tripadvisor and TheFork as well as the $8 million loss incurred in Q4 of 2024 related to a targeted payment fraud scheme, which did not reoccur in 2023 and accounted for half of the year-over-year leverage.', 'During the quarter, we also incurred approximately $4 million in restructuring expenses related to the previously announced actions we implemented at both brand Tripadvisor and TheFork. Now on to our cash and liquidity position. Operating cash flow was a deficit of $19 million and free cash flow was a deficit of $35 million, driven by normal seasonal trends in deferred merchant payables at Viator. During the quarter, we repurchased approximately 1.3 million shares at an average cost of $18.85 per share, totaling approximately $25 million under our current share repurchase program. Turning now to our full year performance. Consolidated revenue grew 20% to $1.8 billion. As a reminder, year-over-year growth in the first quarter of the year benefited from an easier comparable.', ""On a segment basis, brand Tripadvisor grew 7% to $1 billion, while Viator grew 49% to $737 million, and TheFork grew 22% to $154 million. Consolidated adjusted EBITDA for the full year was $334 million or 19% of revenue or 100 basis points lower than '22 adjusted EBITDA margin. Sales and marketing and G&A costs as a percent of revenue were flat, while cost of revenue and technology and content slightly increased as a percent of revenue. Turning to segment EBITDA for the year. Brand Tripadvisor delivered $348 million in adjusted EBITDA or 34% of revenue. For the year, a combination of investment in data and engineering headcount, higher cost of revenue in media and advertising and higher cloud migration costs as a percent of revenue drove the approximately 200 basis point decline year-over-year."", 'Viator adjusted EBITDA was breakeven for the full year, which was a 200 basis point improvement from last year with increased leverage from people costs and direct marketing costs, which includes both traffic and brand. Finally, at TheFork, we saw a significant EBITDA improvement in 2023, moving to a loss of $14 million versus a loss of $39 million in 2022. The largest driver of this improvement was in sales and marketing with lower spend in performance and brand marketing as well as increased leverage from sales headcount. This was especially impressive given the COVID subsidy benefit of $11 million received in 2022. Total operating cash flow for the year was $235 million and free cash flow was $172 million. We repurchased a total of 6 million shares this year at an average price of $16.51, totaling $100 million.', ""In light of the announcement earlier in the week, for the time being, we've suspended our share repurchase program. We ended the quarter and year with approximately $1.1 billion in cash and equivalents. As we discussed throughout the year, fiscal '23 operating cash flow and free cash flow were impacted by a net cash outflow of $64 million related to our previously disclosed settlements with the IRS for income tax returns for the years 2009 through 2011. In 2024, we expect a net cash outflow of approximately $80 million to $130 million related to the settlement for the years 2014 to 2016, resulting in an estimated increase in tax expense of approximately $30 million to $60 million, which we'll take in Q1. Now on to thoughts for 2024. In light of the formation of the special committee and evaluation of potential alternatives, we will not be providing a detailed outlook on this call."", 'However, we will provide a framework as to how we are thinking about our priorities for the year. We will continue to invest and operate the brands in a way that strengthens and builds their long-term sustainable competitive advantage. We will do this against a backdrop of what we believe to be a healthy travel market, although we expect to see some normalization across travel this year versus last year. As such, we expect to see some tougher comparisons this year, particularly in Q1, where we expect to see the lowest growth quarter of the year across the segments. At brand Tripadvisor, our priority is the long-term diversification of the portfolio. As we have said since launching our new strategy last year, we expect this to be a multiyear transformation, supporting sustainable future revenue and profit growth.', ""We are aiming for stable revenue dollars for the year while continue to maintain flexibility for investment in our transformation. At Viator, our financial profile will reflect a balance between growth, profitability and market share gains. Combined with some normalization of travel growth, we expect a step down in revenue growth for the year relative to where we exited 2023. We continue to expect Viator to be profitable for the full year. At TheFork, we expect much of the groundwork we laid in 2023 will benefit us in 2024 as we continue to operate with more leverage and efficiency. Our balanced growth and profitability strategy is expected to result in a step down in growth from 2023 levels, but achieved full year profitability. With that, I'd like to turn the call back over to the operator and begin Q&A."", 'Operator: [Operator Instructions].

Specifically, the S&P 500 is now priced at more than 22 times its past-12-month profits and more than 22 times its 12-month earnings projections. Both are unusually high compared to long-term norms."", 'Not every ticker has followed suit, however. A handful of stocks are still more than reasonably priced. And, given the backdrop of persistent inflation and a lethargic economy, it might be time to swap out some of your high-flying growth names for a few more value picks.', ""Here's a look at three of your best value stock prospects to consider jumping into sooner rather than later."", ""Payment-technology stock PayPal (NASDAQ: PYPL) typically isn't a value holding. Because it's a technology name, its business is in (digital payments), and its historic growth rate tended to be high, PayPal shares have been priced at a premium for most of their existence."", ""The COVID-19 pandemic, however, really rattled investors' way of thinking about -- and pricing -- this stock."", ""Oh, it didn't start that way. PayPal shares soared in 2020 and into 2021, with the bulk of the world's consumerism suddenly moving mostly online. It was a clear boon for the payment-tech business. But it was also a boon for all the other payment-technology companies fine-tuning their platforms and growing their reach even before the pandemic took hold. PayPal shares are down more than 80% from their 2021 high and still knocking on the door of multi-year lows as investors weigh the strength of this new competition."", 'But the sellers overshot their target.', ""That's not to suggest investors should simply dismiss alternative payment-tech names like Block or less direct competitors such as Adyen or even Amazon Pay. Those are threats, to be sure. However, since it's priced at less than 12 times its trailing and 12-month projected per-share earnings, the market's looking right past the fact that PayPal is still this industry's market leader while also ignoring that it's still growing its top and bottom lines. Indeed, the company handled 12% more payment volume in 2023 than it did in 2022, despite the world continuing to ease back into pre-pandemic, in-person consumerism mode."", 'Investors should recognize this reality in the foreseeable future.', ""It's been a tough past few years for Kraft Heinz (NASDAQ: KHC), and by extension, for Kraft Heinz shareholders. The stock has lost over 60% of its value since 2017, when it became clear that the 2015 merger of Kraft Foods and H.J. Heinz wasn't working as well as hoped. The two organizations aren't more competitive when working as one, and cost-cutting linked to the pairing has arguably done more harm than good. Even Warren Buffett -- who largely orchestrated the deal -- concedes that the pairing of the two organizations was an expensive flop. What's done is done, though."", ""The thing is, time eventually heals almost all wounds. Kraft Heinz may finally be on the mend. Last year's sales were up, and perhaps more importantly, profits are up because the food giant is now spending money on the right things. Those things are marketing, technology, and research and development."", ""The market hasn't seemed to care yet, perhaps unimpressed by the company's lack of past and projected sales revenue growth. Take last quarter's revenue shortfall as an example. Analysts were calling for a top line of $7 billion, but the company only delivered $6.86 billion. Things are slightly more compelling on the earnings front, but only slightly. The company's fourth-quarter bottom line of $0.78 per share topped estimates of $0.77."", ""Look at the bigger picture, though. While things are slow-moving, CEO Miguel Patricio does seem to be steering this enormous boat in the right direction. The company is modeling a little more sales and profit-margin growth for this year despite the challenging environment, and analysts expect the same. Newcomers can not only jump into this revitalization while the stock's trading at a modest 12.5 times its trailing per-share profits, but also while the well-protected dividend yield stands at 4.4%."", ""This company isn't just cheese and ketchup, by the way. Kraft Heinz is also parent to familiar brands like Oscar Mayer, Ore-Ida, Philadelphia Cream Cheese, Capri Sun, Maxwell House, and Jell-O, just to name a few. It's got something to sell to everyone."", ""Last but not least, add credit card outfit American Express (NYSE: AXP) to your list of no-brainer value stocks to buy if you've got $1,000 you know you won't be needing anytime soon."", ""While it's categorized as a credit card company, the classification doesn't quite do it justice. American Express is better described as an operator of a rewards-based payment network ... a good one. It's so good, in fact, that cardholders are willing to pay up to $695 per year just for access to perks like cash-back on grocery purchases, additional points toward future hotel stays, ride-hailing credits, and discounts on select streaming services. Mastercard and Visa card issuers certainly offer rewards and perks programs of their own. None of them hold a candle, however, to the depth and breadth of American Express's offerings."", ""This of course changes the dynamic of the company's business model. Whereas Visa and Mastercard simply keep a small piece of every transaction they process, a big chunk of American Express's top line comes in the form of fees. Generally speaking (and perhaps more importantly), this model also means American Express cardholders tend to be more affluent than average and therefore pose less credit risk to the card company itself."", ""That's why its write-offs remain relatively low, despite plenty of people increasingly feeling the burden of more expensive debt since 2022. This is also why last year's top line improved to the tune of 10% year over year, pushing per-share profits up from 2022's $9.85 to $11.21 in 2023."", ""This stock rallied of late, reflecting this resiliency. In fact, shares are up nearly 50% from October's low, soaring with the broad market's bullish tide.

(NYSE:MLM) had a good week, as its shares rose 2.4% to close at US$540 following the release of its full-year results. Martin Marietta Materials reported in line with analyst predictions, delivering revenues of US$6.8b and statutory earnings per share of US$18.82, suggesting the business is executing well and in line with its plan. Following the result, the analysts have updated their earnings model, and it would be good to know whether they think there's been a strong change in the company's prospects, or if it's business as usual. With this in mind, we've gathered the latest statutory forecasts to see what the analysts are expecting for next year."", ' View our latest analysis for Martin Marietta Materials ', ""Following the latest results, Martin Marietta Materials' 16 analysts are now forecasting revenues of US$6.98b in 2024. This would be a satisfactory 3.0% improvement in revenue compared to the last 12 months. Per-share earnings are expected to accumulate 8.8% to US$21.11. Before this earnings report, the analysts had been forecasting revenues of US$7.31b and earnings per share (EPS) of US$20.90 in 2024. The consensus seems maybe a little more pessimistic, trimming their revenue forecasts after the latest results even though there was no change to its EPS estimates."", 'The average price target was steady at US$560even though revenue estimates declined; likely suggesting the analysts place a higher value on earnings. It could also be instructive to look at the range of analyst estimates, to evaluate how different the outlier opinions are from the mean. Currently, the most bullish analyst values Martin Marietta Materials at US$642 per share, while the most bearish prices it at US$350. There are definitely some different views on the stock, but the range of estimates is not wide enough as to imply that the situation is unforecastable, in our view.', ""One way to get more context on these forecasts is to look at how they compare to both past performance, and how other companies in the same industry are performing. We would highlight that Martin Marietta Materials' revenue growth is expected to slow, with the forecast 3.0% annualised growth rate until the end of 2024 being well below the historical 10% p.a. growth over the last five years. Compare this against other companies (with analyst forecasts) in the industry, which are in aggregate expected to see revenue growth of 6.3% annually. Factoring in the forecast slowdown in growth, it seems obvious that Martin Marietta Materials is also expected to grow slower than other industry participants."", ""The most important thing to take away is that there's been no major change in sentiment, with the analysts reconfirming that the business is performing in line with their previous earnings per share estimates. On the negative side, they also downgraded their revenue estimates, and forecasts imply they will perform worse than the wider industry. Even so, earnings per share are more important to the intrinsic value of the business. There was no real change to the consensus price target, suggesting that the intrinsic value of the business has not undergone any major changes with the latest estimates."", ""With that in mind, we wouldn't be too quick to come to a conclusion on Martin Marietta Materials.

For reconciliations to the comparable GAAP measures, please refer to the appendix. I'll now turn the call over to Vince."", 'Vincent Sorgi', ""Thank you, Andy, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to our fourth quarter and year-end investor update. I'm excited for today's call as we closed out 2023 in strong fashion, and our future continues to look very bright. And I look forward to highlighting why that is on today's call. Turning to Slide 4. I'm very proud of what our PPL team was able to accomplish in 2023. In short, it was a year of challenges met and promises kept. Most importantly, we delivered electricity and natural gas safely and reliably to our more than 3.5 million customers. This included top quartile T&D reliability at each of our utilities, including record reliability for our companies in Kentucky and Rhode Island and top decile performance in Pennsylvania. Our generation reliability in Kentucky was among the very best in the nation. We achieved all this despite heightened storm activity in each of our service territories. At the same time and despite over $0.10 per share impact from mild weather and storms, we delivered on every one of our financial commitments to our shareowners. Namely, we achieved ongoing earnings of $1.60 per share, exceeding the midpoint of our ongoing earnings forecast by $0.02 and delivering over 8% growth from pro forma 2022. We achieved this through our strong focus on operational efficiency and outperformance in key areas that Joe will cover in his financial review. We also executed $2.4 billion in planned capital spend on time and on budget to advance a reliable, resilient, affordable and cleaner energy future. We exceeded our annual O&M savings target for 2023 through our strong enterprise-wide focus on technology and business transformation, achieving $75 million in savings from our 2021 baseline, reinforcing our continuous improvement mindset and putting us solidly on track to deliver our targeted $175 million in O&M savings by 2026. These operational and financial achievements were matched by strong results elsewhere in the business that position us for future success. Underpinned by sound planning and effective management of regulatory proceedings, we secured constructive regulatory outcomes in Kentucky and Rhode Island. In Kentucky, we secured approval for about $2 billion in generation replacement investments as part of our CPCN process that concluded in November of last year. The KPSC's decision ensures that we can continue to meet our customers' future energy needs safely, reliably and affordably while advancing a cleaner energy mix in the state. And in Rhode Island, we secured approval of our first infrastructure, safety and reliability plans since acquiring Rhode Island Energy. In addition, we received the green light to deploy advanced metering functionality across Rhode Island, as we lay a foundation for a smarter, more resilient, more reliable and more dynamic electric grid capable of supporting the state's leading climate goals. Finally, we continue to provide a smooth and seamless transition to PPL ownership for our Rhode Island Energy stakeholders, completing all planned 2023 integration milestones and keeping us on track to exit our remaining transition service agreements with National Grid in mid-2024. These achievements are a direct result of our focus on execution, our disciplined investment strategy, our ability to adjust when challenges arise, our experienced leadership team and clarity of purpose across PPL as we pursue our utility of the future strategy. Looking ahead, we recognize we still have room to improve as we pursue our vision to be the best utility company in the U.S. And in 2024, we're determined to make continued progress as we seek to maximize long-term value for both our customers and shareowners. Turning to Slide 5. Today, we announced the results of our updated business plan, which extends our projected growth outlook through at least 2027. In connection with this update, today, we announced our 2024 ongoing earnings forecast range of $1.63 to $1.75 per share. The midpoint of this range, $1.69 per share, represents 7% growth from our 2023 ongoing earnings per share target, consistent with our long-term growth targets. In addition, today, we announced a quarterly common stock dividend of $0.2575 per share. This represents a 7.3% increase from the current quarterly dividend of $0.24 per share and aligns with our commitment to dividend growth in line with our EPS growth targets. We've extended our 6% to 8% annual EPS and dividend growth targets through at least 2027 based off the midpoint of our 2024 earnings forecast range. In addition to today's updated growth forecast, our updated capital plan includes $14.3 billion from 2024 to 2027 to strengthen grid reliability and resiliency and advance a cleaner energy mix without compromising on affordability. The new plan is expected to drive average annual rate base growth of 6.3% through 2027, up from the prior growth rate of 5.6%. We plan to fund these additional investments supported by our exceptional balance sheet as our credit metrics remain well within our targets throughout the planned period without the need for equity issuances through at least 2027. As I highlighted in my recap of 2023, we've made outstanding progress towards our multiyear target of at least $175 million in annual O&M savings by 2026. Based on the progress we made last year, we remain solidly on track to deliver our 2024 targeted savings of $120 million to $130 million. In terms of rate case timing in the plan, we do not anticipate any base rate case filings in 2024 in Pennsylvania, Kentucky or Rhode Island. Looking beyond 2024, our current projections would have us filing a base rate case a bit sooner in Kentucky than previously anticipated due to several factors, including the CPCN decision and additional capital investment needs on the T&D side of the business. Currently, we believe the earliest we would file a rate case in Kentucky will be in the first half of 2025. For Rhode Island, the earliest we would file is late 2025, which is consistent with the prior plan. Finally, in Pennsylvania, recall that we have not been in for a base rate case since 2015, and we have no plans to go in again before 2026 at the earliest. The DSIC mechanism in Pennsylvania has operated as designed to support long-term infrastructure investment between rate cases. We do see an increased need to invest more to improve reliability on the distribution system and filed with the Pennsylvania PUC a request to modify our long-term infrastructure improvement plan, or LTIP, which includes an increase in planned DSIC eligible investment over a 5-year period.We are considering filing a waiver request with the Pennsylvania PUC in the near future, requesting modifications to the DSIC mechanism to support accelerated replacement of aging infrastructure. As always, our focus is on maintaining affordability for our customers. And we will continue to evaluate the need for future rate cases based on a variety of factors, including capital plans, interest rates, market conditions and regulatory lag. Turning to Slide 6. Our updated plan and business outlook supports our utilities of the future strategy, which is core to everything we do. What does that mean to us? It means updating our design criteria and continuing to harden our transmission and distribution systems to protect against climate change and keep our systems and data secure again cyber threats. It means expanding our industry-leading use of technology, including smart grids, automation, data analytics, AI and technologies that haven't even been invented yet to build a self-healing grid. It means investing in R&D to drive innovation to advance technologies that can be scaled safely, reliably and affordably to meet our customers' evolving energy needs and to actually achieve net zero. Like the carbon capture project that was awarded a $72 million DOE grant at our Cane Run Combined Cycle Plant in Kentucky. At the same time, it means expanding transmission and incorporating grid-enhancing technologies to connect more renewables and improve reliability for our customers, advancing a cleaner generation mix while keeping energy safe, reliable and affordable. Expanding our ability to reliably manage 2-way power flows on the distribution network as we connect significantly more distributed energy, driving operational efficiencies to support an affordable clean energy transition. Partnering with our customers and state and local officials to enable growth and economic development in our communities. And lastly, expanding self-service options for our customers using digital tools to enhance the customer experience.Turning to Slide 7. As you can hear, creating the utilities of the future requires change across our entire business, and it requires significant investments to support a net zero economy. The industry and others are projecting a 200% to 300% increase in electricity demand, which will require additions of reliable generation unless we see unprecedented amounts of energy conservation. At the same time, aging fossil fuel plants in this country are being retired very rapidly without replacements of reliable, dispatchable generation capacity. And considering that fossil fuel generation represents more than 50% of our total capacity in the U.S., that presents a potentially major problem if this transition is not managed appropriately. The math simply doesn't add up. When we don't have proven scalable technology currently available to actually achieve net zero carbon emissions that customers can afford.Most technologies used in our industry took 40 years to commercialize from the demonstration phase. We need to cut that time frame in half, at least, to meet net by 2050 targets, especially as we think about the big 4 new potential technologies, nuclear SMRs, carbon capture and sequestration, long-duration energy storage and hydrogen. In the meantime, we need to leverage commercially viable resources that exist today to reduce our carbon footprint while maintaining reliability. Those that are dispatchable, can ramp up and down quickly and are vital to balancing the gaps left on the system by intermittent renewables. That is why natural gas generation is the key to achieving deep decarbonization in this country. And it actually allows us to deploy more renewables than we would otherwise be able to do because of the reliability benefits of natural gas.In a nutshell, this is what makes the energy transition such a challenge, being able to deliver the clean energy future in a way that maintains reliability and affordability for our customers. However, with every challenge brings opportunity. And that's why we know our utilities of the future strategy is the right approach for this dynamic energy landscape. It's why our generation transition plan in Kentucky is reasoned and delivered and ensures we can maintain the reliability and resiliency our customers and public officials demand. We actually need to figure out a way to do the same in deregulated markets like PJM and ISO New England. And it's why becoming more efficient is such a critical component of our strategy because for every dollar of O&M we can take out of the business, we can spend $8 on capital without impacting the customer bill. The energy transition simply won't happen if customers cannot afford it. This is how we will achieve our long-term vision and how we intend to enhance the value we deliver for all stakeholders. It requires us to lead from the front. And that is exactly what we've been doing and what we will continue to do in 2024 and beyond.Turning to Slide 8 and our priorities for 2024. In addition to advancing our utilities of the future strategy, our 2024 priorities also include achieving at least the midpoint of our earnings per share forecast, executing $3.1 billion in infrastructure investments to maintain safe, reliable and affordable energy for our customers and modernize the grid. Delivering on our 2024 O&M savings targets as we deploy scalable technologies across our portfolio, take advantage of economies of scale created by our centralization efforts and continue to leverage data analytics to reduce costs and optimize asset planning and maintenance. Finally, we need to complete our integration of Rhode Island Energy and exit all remaining tranches and service agreements with National Grid. Bottom line, we're eager to showcase PPL's strengths once again in 2024, and we are poised to lead on these very significant issues facing our industry. We have tremendous conviction in our strategy and business plan and in our ability to execute them both. And we look forward to once again delivering on our commitments to customers and shareowners. That concludes my business and strategic update. I'll now turn the call over to Joe for the financial update."", 'Joseph P. Bergstein', ""Thank you, Vince, and good morning, everyone. Let's turn to Slide 10. PPL's fourth quarter GAAP earnings were $0.15 per share compared to $0.26 per share in Q4 2022. We recorded special items of $0.25 per share during the fourth quarter, primarily due to a settlement agreement with Talen Energy Corporation as well as integration and related expenses associated with the acquisition of Rhode Island Energy. Adjusting for these special items, fourth quarter earnings from ongoing operations were $0.40 per share, an improvement of $0.12 per share compared to Q4 2022. The primary drivers of this increase were returns on capital investments and lower O&M expenses, partially offset by lower sales volumes, primarily due to the continued mild weather experienced in the fourth quarter of 2023. In total, weather was a $0.02 per share drag on our Q4 results compared to our plan. On an annual basis, our 2023 GAAP earnings were $1 per share. Adjusting for $0.60 per share of special items recorded throughout the year, our 2023 ongoing earnings were $1.60 per share. This compares to $1.41 per share of ongoing earnings for 2022 or a 13% increase from those prior year results. And as Vince noted, we delivered our earnings target for 2023, exceeding the $1.58 per share midpoint of our earnings forecast. Our teams did a fantastic job of executing our plan while remaining steadfast in achieving our financial goals which enabled us to offset the adverse impacts of significant unfavorable weather and storm activity, while maintaining reliability for our customers. 2023 demonstrated our ability to deal with adversity and still achieve our commitments to both customers and shareowners, adding to our confidence in our ability to achieve our earnings targets.Turning to the ongoing segment drivers for the fourth quarter on Slide 11. Our Pennsylvania Regulated segment results increased by $0.04 per share compared to the same period a year ago. The increase was primarily driven by lower O&M and higher transmission revenue, partially offset by lower sales volumes and higher interest expense. Our Kentucky segment results increased by $0.06 per share compared to the fourth quarter of 2022. The improvement in Kentucky's results were primarily driven by lower O&M expense, partially offset by lower sales volumes due to the mild weather. Our Rhode Island segment results increased by $0.02 per share. This increase was primarily driven by higher rider revenue from capital investments, partially offset by higher interest expense. Finally, results at Corporate and Other were flat compared to the prior period, primarily due to lower income taxes, offset by higher O&M expense. Moving to Slide 12. 2023 was a pivotal year for PPL following our strategic repositioning, which we completed in 2022. Heading into the year, we set our 2023 earnings forecast range with a midpoint of $1.58 per share, representing 7% growth from the 2022 pro forma midpoint of $1.48 per share, which reflected a full year of earnings from Rhode Island Energy. And for the second consecutive year, we outperformed our own targets, beating our earnings forecast by $0.02 and achieving over 8% growth for the 2022 pro forma forecast midpoint. This was a significant achievement given the abnormally mild weather and storms we experienced, which impacted results by more than $0.10 per share. As I said numerous times over the past year, we were confident that our team would overcome those challenges and deliver on our commitments to both our customers and shareowners. This included several areas of excellent execution and constructive regulatory mechanisms, including prudent management of costs without sacrificing reliability, recovery of critical infrastructure investments in PA through the DSIC mechanism, outperformance in integration of Rhode Island Energy and optimization of our financing plan. Looking at 2024, the midpoint of our earnings forecast range is $1.69 per share, which again represents 7% earnings growth from the midpoint of our 2023 forecast. Since we initially communicated our earnings growth targets to investors, we remain on that consistent trajectory while extending that growth further into the future. And we've done that again today with our extension of the 6% to 8% growth targets to 2027, supported by an updated capital investment plan, which I'll discuss in more detail in a couple of slides.Moving to Slide 13. On this slide, we've provided a walk from our 2023 actual results of $1.60 per share to the midpoint of our 2024 forecast, highlighting the projected drivers of the year-over-year increase by segment. Our Pennsylvania segment results are expected to increase by $0.05 per share in 2024, primarily due to returns on additional capital investments in transmission, higher sales volume and lower O&M, partially offset by less distribution rider recovery and higher interest expense. We project our Kentucky segment results to increase by $0.07 per share in 2024, primarily driven by higher sales volumes due to the expected return to normal weather. Our Rhode Island segment results are expected to increase by $0.02 per share in 2024 compared to our 2023 results. This is primarily due to higher capital investment rider revenue and lower O&M, partially offset by higher depreciation expense. Finally, we project our Corporate and Other results to decrease by $0.05 per share in 2024, primarily due to higher interest expense and other factors that are not individually significant. Turning to Slide 14. Over the next 4 years, we have planned capital investments of $14.3 billion focused on delivering superior service and enhancing the overall customer experience while maintaining an affordable price. This includes advancing industry-leading grid modernization, expanding and hardening our transmission networks, improving the safety of our natural gas networks and implementing our approved generation replacement plan in Kentucky. This plan represents a $2.4 billion increase in capital investments compared to the prior 4-year plan. Approximately $1 billion of that increase is expected to occur in the 2024 to 2026 period. Most of that increase is projected to be in Pennsylvania and Kentucky as we continue to modernize our electric transmission and distribution systems and enhanced reliability and resiliency. We continue to expect significant investment needs into the end of this decade as reflected on our 2027 forecast.This includes nearly $1.2 billion in Pennsylvania, of which approximately 65% is transmission investment under FERC formula rates. $1.8 billion of investment in Kentucky, primarily related to further enhancements on the electric and gas T&D systems and to execute our generation replacement plan. And it includes over $700 million of investment in Rhode Island as we continue to prepare the grid for significant levels of clean energy resources and we enhance resiliency against increasingly severe storms, while continuing our focus to maintain a safe and reliable gas network by replacing leak-prone pipe.Turning to Slide 15. These additional capital investments are projected to lead to annual rate base growth of 6.3% from 2023 to 2027. This compares to annual rate base growth of 5.6% in our prior plan period from 2022 to 2026. As you can see in the chart, 2/3 of our rate base relates to investments in our electric T&D networks, given the significant needs as we strengthen and modernize the grid. Importantly, while we project our total rate base to grow, rate base related to coal generation continues to decline from 2023 to 2027. In fact, the percentage of our total rate base related to coal generation is expected to be less than 12% by the end of 2027, down from about 18% today. And based on this trajectory, we expect this to continue to decline and be under 10% by the end of the decade. In summary, the result of our updated plan narrows the gap between our projected rate base growth and earnings growth targets as investment needs continue to increase with the evolving energy landscape. As such, we continue to be very focused on affordability and maximizing every dollar we spend. Our earnings growth in the near term continues to be driven by the combination of rate base growth and operating efficiencies that we believe maximizes value for both customers and shareowners.Moving to Slide 16. Today, we announced an increase in our quarterly cash dividend to $0.2575 per share. This resulted in an annualized dividend of $1.03 per share compared to our prior annualized dividend of $0.96 per share. The 7.3% increase aligns with our projected 2024 forecasted earnings growth and long-term EPS growth targets. We continue to expect future dividend growth to align with our earnings growth targets. The updated dividend remains within our targeted dividend payout range of 60% to 65% based on the midpoint of our 2024 earnings forecast. The combination of PPL's EPS growth and dividend yields provides investors with an attractive total return proposition in the range of 9% to 12%. Moving to an update on PPL's credit and our financing plan for 2024 on Slide 17. We continue to believe that having one of the sector's strongest balance sheets is a clear strategic advantage that provides the company with significant financial flexibility. Our updated business plan maintains strong credit metrics throughout. This includes maintaining a 16% to 18% FFO-to-debt ratio and a holding company to total debt ratio below 25%. We have limited near-term refinancing risk with 0 maturities in 2024 and only $550 million of total maturities in 2025. And we continue to maintain limited floating rate debt exposure, mitigating volatility in our plan. We also continue to be uniquely positioned to continue to fund our growth without the need for equity throughout our updated planning period, which is now extended through 2027. As investors think about our financing plan for 2024, they should expect our activity to be primarily focused on funding our utility capital plans with operating company debt.We've already executed a portion of this plan with our $650 million PPL Electric Utilities deal in January, which was executed at attractive pricing. We're also planning to be in the market for Rhode Island with our first debt offering since the acquisition. We have no current plans for debt issuances in Kentucky or a PPO capital funding this year, but that is an area we'll continue to evaluate opportunistically in connection with market conditions and our strong financial position. In closing, I'm extremely pleased with our financial position and outlook to execute our updated plan. This concludes my prepared remarks. I'll now turn the call back over to Vince."", 'Vincent Sorgi', ""Thank you, Joe. As I mentioned earlier, this is a pivotal time for our industry, a time that requires us to lead with strength. There is no shortage of challenges facing our industry and being able to deliver the clean energy transition safely, reliably and affordably for our customers. This is what gets me out of bed every morning and why I'm so excited to be a part of this industry at this moment in time. I'm convinced we have the right strategy for the right time, a strategy that prioritizes efficiency and affordability, built on our core strength and will maximize long-term value for customers and shareowners alike. We are well positioned to continue our competitive and predictable long-term earnings growth of 6% to 8% a year. We've established a derisked and disciplined business plan that advances a safe, reliable, affordable and sustainable energy future while providing investors with an attractive return proposition. And finally, we have an experienced leadership team that is 100% committed to delivering on these objectives and backed by a dedicated team of 6,500 strong across PPL. With that, operator, let's open it up for questions."", 'Operator', '(Operator Instructions) The first question today comes from Shar Pourreza with Guggenheim Partners.', 'Shahriar Pourreza', ""So just on the transmission side, I see you've added a couple of hundred million to the Pennsylvania plan. How much of that is tied to the recent RTEP Window 3 awards? The reason why I'm asking is we've seen some significant increases in transmission needs and transfer capability across utilities in Eastern PJM and E-MAC. So just trying to get a sense for what has started to trickle into your plan versus incremental."", 'Joseph P. Bergstein', ""Shar, it's Joe. About half of that increase is driven by what you're describing and what we were awarded in that recent PJM window."", 'Shahriar Pourreza', 'Got it. Perfect. And then just coming back to the Kentucky spend, the CPCN process, obviously, had deferred, but not quite closed the door to the second CCGT. Is that something you could revisit and could the spend start to land in the outer years of the latest plan? Just kind of trying to get a sense for the next incremental focus.', 'Vincent Sorgi', ""Yes. To your point, Shar, the order suggested that we should come back with another CPCN filing with an in-service date for that second CCGT in 2030. And so we would plan on doing that in a couple of years' time to start to prepare for that. And obviously, we'll be updating that as we go through the IRP process this year looking at load and generation economics and all that. So the first point is really the updated IRP that we'll file this year and then ultimately, that will feed into the CPCN filing to be -- to have a planned in service in 2030."", 'Shahriar Pourreza', ""Congrats Vince on the execution. It's pretty notable. Appreciate it."", 'Operator', 'The next question comes from Durgesh Chopra with Evercore ISI.', 'Durgesh Chopra', 'I just add a question on Pennsylvania. Maybe just, can you elaborate on what you plan to do or any color you can share on the district itself? The reason why I ask is the -- your peer water utility in the state, their rate case is drawing a lot of attention, there are new commissioners at the commission. So just -- maybe just talk to the regulatory environment in the state. And then what -- if you could share any color on what you might try to do with amending the district mechanism, that would be great?', 'Vincent Sorgi', ""Sure. So maybe a precursor to the DSIC waiver is really the LTIP process that we have in the state, Durgesh. In mid-January, we filed a petition with the commission to modify our LTIP, which covers the period -- that's the long-term infrastructure improvement plan that covers the period from January 1, 2023 to 12/31/27. So we're already a year into this current LTIP plan. We did file for some significant adjustments to that plan, which the LTIP is really the precursor for the types of projects that would then be eligible to flow through the DSIC mechanism.We're proposing to increase that LTIP plan from about $500 million to about $800 million. We're including a new project or a new program for predictive failure technology. We've been doing a lot of testing on some new devices that we can put on the grid that actually enable us to identify failing equipment before it actually fails and causes an outage. So we have some money in there that we want to include. We're also looking at just other distribution reliability projects. Our reliability very strong in Pennsylvania, being led by our transmission results there. We need to continue to improve our distribution reliability. So additional money in there for that.And then, of course, we have the approved projects through the IIJA process that we also updated the LTIP for. So the parties have 30 days to file comments on our LTIP filing. And those comments are actually due today. So we'll want to review those comments before we file for the DSIC waiver request. We have notified the PUC of our intention to file that waiver request. And we'd expect to file that relatively soon, Durgesh. At this point, the request, what we're still working on, it will likely be in the form of higher cap on the DSIC."", 'Operator', 'The next question comes from Agnie Storozynski with Seaport.', 'Agnieszka Anna Storozynski', ""So I -- it's a bit of an unfair question, I admit. So we're waiting to see this potential large data center to be developed next to or -- directly next to the Susquehanna nuclear plant, which is obviously, your service territory and your former asset. So I'm just wondering, so if that were to happen, if we were to have this almost 1,000 megawatts data center? What type of investments would that require from you guys, from like a T&D perspective? And is it already embedded in your plan?"", 'Vincent Sorgi', ""Yes. So let me talk about maybe data centers more broadly. You're referring to one that's specifically related or will be tied to the Susquehanna nuclear plant. So most of that activity is really between Talen and the data center entity, although we are working with Talen to ensure that the reliability of power supply is there for that center. So some incremental work there, Angie.What I would say, though, more broadly, beyond that specific instances, we've really started to see some data center activity, both in Pennsylvania and Kentucky, with some very large load requirements, again, 1-gig size projects. Some smaller than that, but we are seeing some 1-gig projects as well. And in our territories, we have some -- a number of positive attributes that these data centers are looking for. Not only is our reliability very strong in the top quartile, top decile range, especially in our transmission side of the business, which is where these generally are pulling their power from, our reliability there is extremely high. We also have relatively inexpensive land and an abundance of that land in both of our jurisdictions in PA and Kentucky. And then in Pennsylvania, in particular, we have a decent amount of capacity on the transmission network that we could add this load without a lot of investment that still is incredibly beneficial for our customers because that will still lower the overall cost and bill for our retail customers, the more and more load that we can connect to the transmission network. And then, of course, we're close to New England and the Mid-Atlantic region, especially as you think about Pennsylvania. So there's a number of things in our territories that make this attractive. And of course, in Kentucky, we have relatively cheap power prices. So very active in working with the data center companies. We haven't included these in our load forecast at this point. We will do that at the appropriate time if and when we close these deals with these folks. But I would just say, at this point, a lot of activity going on with the data centers as you're hearing with some of our peers as well."", 'Agnieszka Anna Storozynski', ""And can I ask about Kentucky. So you mentioned that the grid is getting tighter from the power supply perspective. I mean, one, does it make you sort of reassess your plans about retirements of coal plants and/or additions of new gas plants in the state? And also, how do those data center providers actually look at thermal power from gas and coal versus, I don't know, nuclear or renewables? Does that matter? Do they really care about the carbon footprint or emissions? Or is it mostly the total cost and how cheap the power is?"", 'Vincent Sorgi', ""Yes. For the most part, what we're seeing, Angie, is reliability and reliability of power. I think you're right, there are some data center companies that also want to ensure that, that power is coming from green energy sources like what we're seeing up in Susquehanna, as you mentioned earlier. But for the most part, it's about reliability and the cost of that power because, obviously, these are huge costs for these data centers, just the cost of the electricity itself. So to your point, we don't have as much capacity in Kentucky as we do up here in Pennsylvania. And so we would expect there to be incremental investment needed to support data centers in Kentucky, perhaps more so than we would need at least in the near term in Pennsylvania. Certainly, this will feed into -- as I was mentioning before, into our IRP process as we look at our load growth, as we think about our generation replacement strategy, a little too early, I would say, to say we need to modify our current thinking on that. But clearly, if some of these large centers hit, we're going to have to factor that into the IRP and then ultimately into that CPCN request a couple of years from now."", 'Operator', 'The next question comes from Paul Zimbardo with Bank of America.', 'Paul Andrew Zimbardo', ""First one on the O&M target and please correct me if I'm wrong., it looks like you reaffirmed them all, but exceeded the 2023 target by around like $20 million. Just what would -- I know the targets are at least, what would you need to see to kind of increase those targets? And what kind of drove that initial outperformance versus target?"", 'Joseph P. Bergstein', ""Yes, sure. Paul, it's Joe. So first focusing on what drove the outperformance in 2023. As we noted, we achieved $75 million in savings compared to the $50 million to $60 million target that we had coming into the year. It was really driven by acceleration of some of the initiatives from 2024. When we started the TMO process, we had initiative owners for all these projects that will deliver these savings. And we've set milestones and KPIs for all of them. And so what we saw bringing that rigor to the process has actually allowed us to accelerate in some areas, which gives us confidence in achieving the $120 million to $130 million next year and the $175 million overall. As we talked about -- as Vince talked about in his remarks, focused on the utilities of the future and ensuring affordability for customers is key. And so from that perspective, we'll continue to look to get more efficient as we go through the plan. But where we are today is we're still holding that $175 million -- at least $175 million as we said. What I can say is the growth that we're talking about here and extending that into 2027 doesn't rely on further efficiencies. So to the extent that we're successful in identifying more of that would be upside to the current plan."", 'Paul Andrew Zimbardo', ""Okay. Great. Very clear. And then on the rate case timing strategy, I know Vince listed a bunch of factors. But one of them wasn't about how rate cases go for peers. Just curious how important is that as you think through the process, how the -- especially in Pennsylvania, just given a lot of the rate cases As Durgesh was mentioning, how important is that to kind of assess your own plan?"", 'Vincent Sorgi', ""Yes. Well, clearly, because we have no rate cases in 2024 across the board, we're able to assess the regulatory environment and the outcomes that our peers are getting. As we know, not every company gets the same outcome even under the same jurisdiction, so it wouldn't totally impact our decision. But clearly, it's something that we will keep an eye on and feed into our decision making. And again, the fact that we don't have anything for the -- certainly the rest of this year and likely the first one will be down in Kentucky sometime in 2025. I feel pretty good about our timing that we have in the plan right now."", 'Operator', '(Operator Instructions) The next question comes from Anthony Crowdell with Mizuho.', 'Anthony Christopher Crowdell', ""Congrats on a good quarter. Just a couple of quick ones. One up to follow-up from Angie's question. What's this load growth forecast you're assuming for '24??"", 'Joseph P. Bergstein', ""Anthony, it's Joe. We're assuming 50 basis points load growth throughout our planning horizon."", 'Anthony Christopher Crowdell', ""Great. And then if I could jump on Durgesh's question, in Pennsylvania, you're filing the DSIC, and I think you're looking to raise the cap you talked about it. Just curious -- again, I'm not saying that it's -- I'm here to say it doesn't get approved. But if you don't get approval, does that increase the frequency of the rate filing or you believe you have other offsets that you could still stay out in Pennsylvania a little longer?"", 'Vincent Sorgi', ""Yes, it's the latter, Anthony. We have some modest value in the plan coming from the DSIC filing. I think the real benefit is, it would enable us to stay out longer in Pennsylvania and make the investments that we had talked about. But yes, to your point, if for some reason that, that request is not get approved, we're comfortable we can manage that and still maintain the growth targets that we've talked about."", 'Anthony Christopher Crowdell', ""Great. And then just lastly on Slide 17. I appreciate the detail on -- you don't have any near-term financing. Just in 2026, you see the capital funding, you also have the electric utility funding there. On those maturities, do you think you'll retire those vehicles -- those financing vehicles? Do you think you just roll over that. I'm just curious on what your plan is on those financing vehicles?"", 'Joseph P. Bergstein', ""Yes, Anthony, we'll have to assess that as we get closer. Obviously, where interest rates are will play a big role in what we do there. So I think it's a little early to tell on how we'll treat those. Our assumption is that we refi them (inaudible)."", 'Operator', 'The next question comes from David Paz with Wolfe.', 'David Alexander Paz', 'Can you hear me?', 'Joseph P. Bergstein', 'Yes.', 'David Alexander Paz', ""Okay. Great. Just actually following up on the previous question. It's FFO to debt, in particular, where are you in that 16% to 18% currently? And where kind of -- how does that -- what's the profile of that over the course of your plan?"", 'Joseph P. Bergstein', ""Yes. I would just say we're comfortably in that 16% to 18% range. In the early part of the plan, we continue to have integration cost for Rhode Island that obviously are -- impact the credit metric and those roll away. And then you see the CapEx increase later in the plan. So we feel really good about where we are within that range and kind of operate comfortably around the midpoint."", 'David Alexander Paz', ""Perfect. And then just -- I don't know if you touched on this, but what are your opportunities -- or what opportunities do you see from the pending offshore wind solicitations, more transmission? What do you have in your plan, if anything? Just any color you can provide, that would be great."", 'Vincent Sorgi', ""Sure. So a couple of opportunities there. Obviously, we have the RFP that we've issued in Rhode Island. We are not the owners of that, but we would be the offtaker of that generation. And so to your point, we have -- we do have in the plan the transmission required to -- the enhancements to transmission grid to handle that offshore wind load. We have talked in the past about our -- a joint venture with wind grid to potentially provide wet transmission solutions more broadly up in Rhode Island or New England that we would partner with them on where we would not own the turbine -- the wind turbine generation, but we would build out a mesh network of sorts to lower the overall cost of the transmission build-out as we think about upwards of 30 gigs of offshore wind over the next, say, decade being built out there. That opportunity will highly depend on where the U.S. Treasury ultimately comes out on their implementation provisions for the IRA. So we are monitoring those regulations very closely. The initial regs that came out from the treasury, we think were in error in proposing that the regulations would limit the eligibility of the ITC credit for that wet transmission only if that transmission is owned by the same taxpayer that owns the wind turbines themselves. That limitation, if the final rules come out that way, would unnecessarily raise the cost of the offshore wind industry, which we know is quite challenged. And so we continue to engage with the administration and other policymakers to try to improve that final regulation and expand it to all taxpayers, not just ones that own the turbines, and to try to bring the overall cost of offshore wind down so that we can get this very important clean energy source kind of up and running in the U.S. But I can't give you any assurance in terms of what that final rule is going to say. I can't say we don't have any of that upside potential in our business plan, it's not in our growth projections at all at this point. I would say, it kind of hinges on this, and then the states really coming together up there and partnering on this broader solution, which we believe will certainly bring the cost of offshore wind down."", 'Operator', 'This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Vince Sorgi for any closing remarks.', 'Vincent Sorgi', ""Just want to say thanks for joining us. Again, strong end to 2023, really looking forward to 2024 and beyond. I've spent quite a bit of time talking about the Utility of the Future strategy. We do think that's an area that differentiates us from our peers as well as the strength of our balance sheet and our overall dividend policy where we're growing the dividend in line with earnings. So just appreciate everybody for calling us and for joining us and look forward to providing updates as we go through the year. Thanks so much.""]"

The arrangement may not placate Mondelez critics. The company has three factories in Russia and has continued to sell its products including Milka chocolate there despite investor pressure and boycotts calling for it to leave.', '""In the law we use the expression \'a distinction without a difference.\' This is an attempted workaround that is not very meaningful,"" said Nell Minow, a corporate governance expert and vice chair of ValueEdge Advisors. ""There are certain kinds of business connections where you see a justification, if it has to do with health, urgently needed supplies.

Big Oil in the U.S. appears to be undergoing a transition, as several well-known companies make large acquisitions to solidify their position in the future of oil and gas. In October, both Chevron and Exxon announced a major new deal, with Occidental following in December, and Diamondback in February, suggesting this is the new direction that U.S. oil and gas is going to go from now on.', 'In October, Chevron announced it was buying Hess for $53 billion in stock. This provided Chevron with a 30 percent stake in\xa0Guyana’s Stabroek Block, giving the company a piece of an 11 billion barrel pie and a future in “low-carbon” oil production. This merger demonstrates Chevron’s aim to diversify its operations, allowing it to expand to new locations in Guyana and North Dakota – through Bakken shale operations. While it added just 386,000 bpd to Chevron’s output, it provides significant potential for future production.', 'That same month, Exxon Mobil announced it had purchased\xa0Pioneer Natural Resources\xa0for $59.5 billion in an all-stock deal. This is Exxon’s largest merger since its acquisition of Mobil. In contrast to Chevron, this deal enhanced Exxon’s position in regions of existing operations, doubling its production volume in the Permian Basin. The merger added 711,000 bpd to Exxon’s portfolio.', 'The mergers demonstrated clear ambitions from the two companies to continue investing in oil and gas operations, so long as the global demand for crude remains high. This follows\xa0several other mergers\xa0in the North American shale space last year, with a few large companies absorbing smaller operations to boost their output in the region. Bob McNally, the president of Rapidan Energy Group,\xa0stated, “These megadeals are just a prelude to this large investment wave I expect in coming years.” He added, “These deals signify the shift from a multi-year bust phase in oil that began in 2014 to a multi-year boom phase that should last well through this decade.”', 'In December, another megamerger took place when Occidental Petroleum Corporation acquired local competitor CrownRock Minerals in a\xa0$12 billion deal. The deal is expected to be completed in the first quarter of this year. The merger supports CrownRock’s plan to develop a 100,000-acre space in the Midland Basin, which forms part of the Permian and produced\xa015 percent of U.S. crude\xa0in 2020. It will add 170,000 bpd of oil to Occidental’s output and add 1,700 undeveloped locations in the Permian to its portfolio. Occidental will finance the deal through $9.1 billion in debt and about $1.7 billion in common stock. This marks a distinct shift in the region as CrownRock is one of the last major private producers in the Permian, alongside Endeavor Energy Resources.', 'Production in the Permian was once dominated by small producers that deployed new production techniques to access vast amounts of oil in the regions that many of the oil majors overlooked, establishing the U.S. as the world’s biggest crude producer. This encouraged large public companies to launch operations in the region, in addition to their global operations. This was only made possible after fracking technology was started being used, unlocking oil that was previously trapped in the region. This led a large number of companies to operate in the region. Mark Viviano, a managing partner at investment firm Kimmeridge Energy Management,\xa0explained\xa0“Consolidation is the last piece of the puzzle in rationalizing the shale industry.”', 'This month, solidifying the shift in the region, Diamondback Energy announced plans to buy Endeavor in a $26-billion merger. This is expected to boost Diamondback’s value to $50 billion. There were rumours that Diamondback’s rival ConocoPhillips was also interested in purchasing Endeavor. The deal provides Diamondback with an additional 400,000 bpd of output in the Permian.', 'Diamondback’s CEO Travis Stice,\xa0stated, “This is a combination of two strong, established companies merging to create a ‘must own’ North American independent oil company.” He added that the company would “have industry-leading depth and quality that will be converted into cash flow with the industry’s lowest cost structure”.', 'The wave of megamergers has been spurred by higher oil prices over the last couple of years, and crude shortages following the sanctions imposed by the U.S. and Europe on Russian energy, following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Oil companies in the U.S. have been racing to increase their crude output to meet the growing demand for alternative supply chains. Several companies are using the massive profits they have earned over the last two years to invest in mergers, solidifying their position in U.S. oil production. This will reduce the number of companies operating in the U.S. oil regions and ensure a few oil majors’ positions in the future of the industry.', 'By Felicity Bradstock for Oilprice.com', 'More Top Reads From Oilprice.com:', 'Cutting-Edge Experiments Lead to Breakthrough in Superconductor Development', 'Solar Panel Waste is Becoming a Big Problem', 'Tajikistan Boosts Electricity Exports to Afghanistan Despite Domestic Rationing', 'Read this article on OilPrice.com']"

On the call with us today are Vicki Hollub, President and Chief Executive Officer; Sunil Mathew, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; Richard Jackson, President Operations, U.S. Onshore Resources and Carbon Management; and Ken Dillon, Senior Vice President and President, International Oil and Gas Operations. This afternoon, we will refer to slides available on the Investor section of our website.

We’ll also reference a few non-GAAP financial measures today. Reconciliations to the nearest corresponding GAAP measure can be found in the schedules for our earnings release and on our website. I’ll now turn the call over to Vicki.', 'Vicki Hollub: Thank you, Jordan, and good afternoon, everyone. 2023 was a great year for us, thanks to the performance of all of our teams in Oxy. I’m going to start by discussing our financial performance, operational excellence and our strategic advancements in 2023. Then I’ll review our capital plans for 2024. These continue to position us to deliver sustainable and growing returns for our shareholders through our premier asset portfolio, advanced technology and robust commercial runway. First, I’ll begin by reviewing our financial performance in 2023. Last year, our talented and committed teams across the company applied advanced technical expertise, operating skills, leading-edge technologies and innovation to our exceptional portfolio, and they delivered results, $5.5 billion in free cash flow, which enabled us to pay $600 million of common dividends, repurchase $1.8 billion of common shares and redeem $1.5 billion of preferred shares, while also investing $6.2 billion back into the business.', 'Next, I’ll comment on our operational excellence in 2023. Last year, our production in our global oil and gas business exceeded the midpoint of our original four-year production guidance by 43,000 BOE per day. This was driven by record new well productivity rates across our domestic assets in the Delaware, Midland and DJ basins, and internationally by record production from Block 9 in Oman. And in addition, we safely completed the expansion of the Al Hosn plant in the UAE, which also delivered record annual production. Despite negative price revisions, well performance across our portfolio enabled us to achieve an all-in reserves replacement ratio of 137% in 2023 and a three-year average ratio of 183%. Our track record from prior years of consistently replacing produced barrels continues and at an F&D cost that is below our current DD&A rate.', 'Oxy’s year-end 2023 worldwide proved reserves increased to 4.0 billion BOE from 3.8 billion BOE in 2022. OxyChem performed exceptionally well in 2023. It exceeded guidance and achieved $1.5 billion in pre-tax income for the third time in its history, due largely to lower energy costs and an efficient planned turnaround at our Ingleside plant, even as product markets softened compared to 2022. In addition, construction on STRATOS, our first Direct Air Capture facility, is progressing on schedule to be commercially operational in mid-2025. The fourth quarter of 2023 was an exciting way to conclude a successful year. In oil and gas, we delivered our highest quarterly production in over three years and outperformed the midpoint of our production guidance, despite a third-party interruption in the Gulf of Mexico.', 'Our Rockies business outperformed in the fourth quarter and that’s consistent with its year-long trends. Innovative artificial lift technology continued to maximize base production. Well-designed optimization in the DJ Basin that we presented in our second quarter earnings call contributed to a 32% productivity improvement from 2022. We also continued to deliver robust well performance in the Permian Basin, where our Delaware teams drove results to the high end of the Permian’s fourth quarter production guidance. Our Top Spot well, which we also discussed in our second quarter earnings call, continued its strong performance trajectory and delivered the highest six-month cumulative production of any horizontal well ever in the New Mexico, Delaware Basin.', 'In fact, Oxy has drilled eight of the top ten horizontal wells of all time across the entire Delaware, based on this production metric and three of those wells came online last year. Since mid-2022, our teams outperformed the Delaware Basin industry average 12-month cumulative oil production by nearly 50%. Our team aims to extend our leadership in the New Mexico, Delaware Basin this year. A significant portion of the 2024 Delaware program will develop the same horizon as the record Top Spot well. Further south in the Texas, Delaware Basin, our teams continue to deliver success with a couple of notable appraisal wells in the second Bone Spring and third Bone Spring line. These wells drove incredibly early time volumes and accordingly secured additional capital in our 2024 Delaware program.', 'Our appraisal programs are positioning us for success by adding horizons in the Delaware Basin and moving Tier 2 and Tier 3 wells to Tier 1. But we’re also improving our current Tier 1 intervals, for example, with our Top Spot well. Outside the Delaware Basin, we’re also making strides in some of the basins that we expect will begin to play a more consequential role. In the Midland Basin, technical excellence, including the basin-leading Barnett wells, drove a one-year cumulative improvement in well productivity of over 30% compared to the prior year. In the Powder River Basin, Oxy had one Wyoming state initial production and early cumulative production pad record of 1.5 million barrels of oil produced in only about seven months. As we highlighted, our uncommissional technical teams continue to expand and improve inventory across all U.S. Onshore basins.', 'While our subsurface modeling, innovative well designs and enhanced artificial lift technology have driven improvements in well recovery, new well designs have also resulted in record drilling times for both 2-mile and 3-mile Texas, Delaware Basin laterals. Similarly, in the Powder River Basin, our teams drilled an average 1,650 feet per day and we drilled a 10,000-foot well in only 11 days, both achieving Oxy basin records. Our successes are not limited to our Onshore U.S. portfolio. In the deepwater Gulf of Mexico, we are continuing to leverage technology to drive even stronger production results. Our subsea pumping system on the K2 field achieved first lift four months ahead of schedule. This is Oxy’s first deployment of this technology in deepwater.', 'We expect it to unlock future production enhancement opportunities and longer-distance subsea tiebacks. Next, I’ll shift to discussing how we advanced our strategy last year. In 2023, we high-graded our oil and gas portfolio, launched the expansion of our OxyChem Battleground facility and announced strategic commercial transactions that we expect will deliver sustainable multiyear value to our shareholders. These steps strengthened our portfolio and make it unique in our industry. We have high-quality, short-cycle, high-return oil and gas shale development in the U.S., along with conventional, lower-decline oil and gas development in Permian EOR, GoM, Oman, Algeria and Abu Dhabi. These developments are complemented by our strong and stable cash flow from our chemicals business and the cash flow and carbon reduction we expect our low-carbon ventures to provide in the future.', 'In addition to high-grading our oil and gas portfolio through organic development and appraisal work last year, we also announced the strategic acquisition of CrownRock, which will add high-margin, low-break-even inventory, while increasing free cash flow for delivered share. The incremental cash flow will support our cash flow priority of delivering a sustainable and growing dividend, along with deleveraging and share repurchases after reducing the principal debt to $15 billion. We are working constructively with the FTC in its review of the transaction and expect to receive regulatory approval and close in the second half of this year. The capital plan we will review in a moment excludes CrownRock, because we’ll continue to operate as two separate companies until we obtain regulatory approval and close the acquisition.', 'In our LCB business, we completed many pivotal transactions that provided technology advancement, third-party capital, revenue certainty and commercial optionality. We closed the acquisition of Direct Air Capture Technology Innovator Carbon Engineering last quarter. This was a landmark achievement in our Direct Air Capture development path. We’re excited also about our STRATOS joint venture with BlackRock, which we believe demonstrates the DAC is becoming an investable asset for world-class financial institutions. In addition, our team signed on several more flagship carbon dioxide removal credit customers. Now I’d like to reiterate our cash flow priorities and discuss our capital plans for 2024. On our December call, we discussed how we will focus on our cash flow and shareholder return priorities in 2024 on dividend growth, debt reduction and the capital allocation program that generates strong free cash flow throughout the commodity cycle.', 'As we discussed regarding CrownRock, we intend to complete at least $4.5 billion in debt repayments for both pro forma cash flow and proceeds from a divestiture program. We intend to prioritize debt reduction until we achieve a principal debt balance of $15 billion or below, including repaying debt as it matures. As a result of the acquisition, we expect to strengthen our balance sheet, improve our resilience in lower commodity price environments and free up cash from interest payments to support future sustainable dividend growth and shareholder purchases. Every year, we design our capital plans to support our strategic initiatives via projects that maximize our returns and best position Oxy to deliver long-term and resilient returns to our shareholders.', 'Our 2024 capital plan continues a bifurcated investment approach that balances short-cycle, high-margin investments with measured, longer-cycle cash flow growth investments. In 2024, we plan to invest $5.8 to $6 billion in our energy and chemicals businesses, resulting in slightly less capital for our unconventional assets this year. However, we expect our unconventional assets to return more cash to the business and we continue to expect year-over-year production growth and continued success across our premier unconventional portfolio, including some of the emerging horizons. We intend to complement our unconventional exposure with increases to our mid-cycle investments, including lower decline conventional reservoirs, which are expected to drive longer-cycle cash flow resiliency.', 'Our 2024 mid-cycle capital investments will position us to continue the exciting projects that we started last year. Investments in OxyChem are expected to increase this year as progress continues on the Battleground expansion and the plant enhancement project. We also added a second drillship in the Gulf of Mexico to support what we believe could become a future growth asset for Oxy. Lower decline oil production from our enhanced oil recovery or EOR, is an important part of our long-term strategy. This year, we’re investing in gas processing expansions for our Permian EOR business that support longer term growth in many of our core CO2 fields. Our EOR business will continue to be a key part of our future oil and gas development as we believe that carbon dioxide captured by Direct Air Capture facilities is a sustainable way to develop the 2 billion barrels of potentially recoverable oil remaining in our premier EOR operation.', 'In our emerging low-carbon businesses, much of Oxy’s planned $600 million 2024 investment will be directed to STRATOS. We have also allocated capital to continue preparations for a second Direct Air Capture and sequestration hub in South Texas, along with subsurface and well-permitting investments needed at our Gulf Coast sequestration hubs. Capital received from financial partners for our LCB businesses will add to our $600 million investment. This includes capital contributions from our joint venture partner, BlackRock, for STRATOS. BlackRock’s investment totaled $100 million in 2023 and we expect that figure will increase in 2024. We’re making great progress toward advancing our net-zero pathway as we develop Direct Air Capture and other exciting technologies.', 'We see tremendous potential in LCB to increase Oxy’s cash flow resilience and generate solid long-term returns for our shareholders. I’ll now turn the call over to Sunil for a review of our fourth quarter financial results and 2024 guidance.', 'Sunil Mathew: Thank you, Vicki. I will begin today by reviewing our fourth quarter results. We announced an adjusted profit of $0.74 per diluted share and a reported profit of $1.08 per diluted share, with a difference between adjusted and reported profit primarily driven by the after-tax fair value gain related to the acquisition of Carbon Engineering. Our teams exceeded the midpoint of guidance across all three business segments during the fourth quarter and we delivered outstanding operational performance. Higher-than-expected production in our domestic, onshore, and international assets enabled us to overcome production losses caused by an unplanned third-party outage in the eastern Gulf of Mexico. This outage led to a lower-than-expected company-wide oil cut and a higher-than-anticipated domestic operating costs per BOE.', 'It is also expected to impact production into early next month and is reflected in the guidance that I will soon cover. We had a positive working capital change, primarily due to receipt of the environmental remediation settlement, timing of semi-annual interest payments on debt and decreases in commodity prices. We exited the quarter with over $1.4 billion of unrestricted cash. Turning now to guidance. Last month, Oxy and CrownRock each received a request from the FTC for additional information related to the acquisition. The FTC’s request for additional information will impact the timing of closing, which we expect to occur in the second half of the year. Oxy will receive the benefit of CrownRock’s activity between the January 1, 2024 transaction effective date and close, subject to customer repurchase price adjustments.', 'Additionally, the issuance of senior unsecured notes, funding of the fully committed $4.7 billion term loans and termination of the existing bridge loan facility are expected to be aligned with the transaction’s closing. In 2024, we expect full year production to average 1.25 million BOE per day, representing low single-digit growth from 2023, with the Rockies and Al Hosn driving production growth. As Vicki mentioned, well-designed and operational expertise drove production outperformance in the Rockies last year. We anticipate that these results will continue in 2024, with a steadier run rate of wells coming online compared to the first quarter of last year when we recently ramped up brick activity. Permian production is expected to remain largely flat, with Permian unconventional capital decreasing by approximately 10% compared to the prior year.', 'Internationally, we anticipate continued higher production at Al Hosn following last year’s plant expansion. Total company production guidance in the first quarter reflects a low point for 2024, with a significant step-up expected in the remainder of the year. The expected first quarter decrease in production is primarily driven by the relatively lower activity levels and working interest in the Permian Basin in last year’s fourth quarter. January winter storm impacts of approximately 8,000 BOE per day in our domestic onshore assets, annual plant maintenance at Dolphin, and the Gulf of Mexico unplanned downtime event. Domestic operating costs on a BOE basis in 2024 are expected to decrease due to reduced maintenance in the Gulf of Mexico and improved lifting costs in the DJ Basin.', 'Moving on to chemicals. In 2023, OxyChem generated pre-tax income nearly matching its second highest year ever. This year, we are guiding to a midpoint of $1.1 billion of pre-tax income. This year’s full year guidance is close to the fourth best year ever for the chemicals segment, despite potential challenging market conditions. We expect that our first quarter OxyChem results will be largely flat from the prior quarter. Our guidance for Q1 reflects the combination of PVC price erosion largely associated with contract adjustments in Q4, typical seasonal subdued demand in both PVC and caustic, and export pricing pressure on caustic from China. Our guidance assumes that in Q1 we have reached the bottom of the cycle with more stabilized prices.', 'I would like to close today by looking beyond 2024 to highlight several catalysts that we expect will enhance our financial trajectory in the coming years. Our midstream business is well positioned to benefit from a reduction in crude oil transportation rates from the Permian to the Gulf Coast by the end of the third quarter of 2025. We expect annualized savings from these rate reductions of $300 million to $400 million, with approximately 40% of the savings starting in 2025 and the full annual savings anticipated in 2026. The OxyChem Battleground and plant enhancement projects are expected to generate incremental benefits to EBITDA of $300 million to $400 million per year once complete. In combination, these improvements to midstream and chemicals are expected to deliver an incremental annualized run rate EBITDA of $600 million to $800 million.', 'As Vicki discussed, we also expect the planned mid-cycle investments in our conventional Gulf of Mexico and Permian EOR assets to provide cash flow resiliency through lower decline conventional production. As we continue to execute on high-grading our premier portfolio, we are committed to meeting our deleveraging targets that I outlined in December. We believe that a strengthened balance sheet and Oxy’s premier portfolio will enable future increases to our common dividend and rebalance enterprise value in favor of our common shareholders. Our teams are focused on extending Oxy’s track record of operational excellence and solid execution on our path to delivering growing and sustainable shareholder returns over the long-term. I will now turn the call back over to Vicki.', 'Vicki Hollub: Thank you, Sunil. 2023 was a significant year for Oxy on both operational and commercial fronts. Our teams skillfully navigated through the dynamics and I want to recognize our employees’ ingenuity and hard work. Their efforts generated the exciting achievements we covered today, as well as the great progress that is underway to position us for a successful 2024. With that, we’d like to open the call for questions. Jordan mentioned earlier that Richard Jackson and Ken Dillon are also on the call and they will participate in the Q&A session.

If you want to skip our introduction to the global aircraft industry and the latest trends, then you can take a look at the Top 5 Aircraft Manufacturers In The World. ', 'The aircraft industry, just like consumer technology, has been making a lot of news over the past couple of months. This is because, at least when the Western world is concerned, there are only two primary aircraft manufacturing companies whose jets are capable of supporting large scale commercial operations. These are the U.S. aerospace giant The Boeing Company. (NYSE:BA) and its European counterpart Airbus SE (EPA:AIR.PA). Together, the duo dominates the industry for commercial aviation that is led globally by players the likes of Delta Air Lines, Inc. (NYSE:DAL) and United Airlines Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:UAL).', ""What this means is that aircraft manufacturing has to be precisely managed and carefully monitored to ensure that the stringent requirements of a large tube of aluminum traveling at more than half the speed of sound at thousands of feet in the air are met. On this front, the global aviation industry was shocked when a Boeing 737 Max aircraft's door blew out while it was cruising at altitude. Well, what blew out wasn't technically a door. Instead, it was a door plug that budget airlines use to make room for extra seats, and subsequent investigations revealed that a refurbishment oversight had led to the plug missing crucial bolts that would have held it in place."", ""For Boeing stock, the news naturally wasn't greeted well by investors who had already stood by the firm during its recent lowest after crashes that claimed the lives of hundreds of people. The stock is down 18.8% year to date, even while its European rival's shares have appreciated by more than 5% this year so far. The nature of the aviation industry means that since Boeing supplies a substantially larger number of aircraft to airlines than it would have had there been multiple other manufacturers when its production lines stopped due to industry scares or inspection requirements, the impact is significant."", ""In the aftermath of the 737 Max incident, the company shared the impact of the pressurization it faced from regulators and customers in February. Boeing outlined that its aircraft deliveries had shrunk by a third in January, and led the firm to deliver 27 airplanes in January. Had the 737 Max incident not occurred, then Boeing's deliveries might have sat at 38 planes - a fact that underscores the potential impact on a quarterly income statement from a handful of bolts and a lack of oversight. This is particularly painful for Boeing, an established stock that does not pay dividends since it stopped them in the aftermath of the coronavirus pandemic."", ""Yet, the firm's size means that it nevertheless did manage to keep up with Airbus when it came to delivering jets. Airbus's January deliveries stood at 30 planes, and for Boeing, despite the fact that deliveries and orders predictably slowed down, it did manage to make inroads into China in 2024. The firm shared in February 2024 that it has delivered three 737 Max's to China, which had suspended Boeing's imports in 2019."", ""Of course, while commercial aviation dominates the global aviation industry when it comes to size, it is only one portion of the pie. Boeing also makes aircraft for the U.S. military, and along with planes made by Lockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE:LMT), these are capable of both stretching the limits of physics and ferrying service members globally. However, on this front, its Lockheed and Northrop Grumman Corporation (NYSE:NOC) are more prominent. While Boeing's B-52 Stratofortress, an aircraft named after the literal Stratosphere, is nothing short of a modern engineering marvel capable of delivering fear equally just as well as it can deliver armaments, it's Lockheed and General Dynamics's F-16 Fighting Falcon that is the backbone of the global defense aviation industry."", ""But Boeing, Lockheed, Airbus, and Northrop are not the only major aircraft companies. The final segment of this multi billion dollar industry, expected to be worth $626 billion by the end of this decade, is the one that's the most glamorous. This is the private jet industry, and it is dominated by players such as the formidable Brazilian firm Embraer and the well known Gulfstream Corporation.

This is an important time for investors, as they can track a company's performance in its report, look at what experts are forecasting for next year, and see if there has been any change to expectations for the business. Readers will be glad to know we've aggregated the latest statutory forecasts to see whether the analysts have changed their mind on Stryker after the latest results."", ' View our latest analysis for Stryker ', ""Taking into account the latest results, the most recent consensus for Stryker from 25 analysts is for revenues of US$22.2b in 2024.

Before this earnings report, the analysts had been forecasting revenues of US$22.2b and earnings per share (EPS) of US$9.94 in 2024.

Both are heavily exposed to the challenging U.S. housing market and are seeing sales declines. Both are taking substantive internal action to cut costs and actively restructuring their portfolios. Both companies also aim to reduce inventory in the face of declining sales, with dividend yields of 6.3% and 3.6%, respectively. These are attractive stocks for income-seeking investors. But which is the better buy? Here's the lowdown."", ""It's worth noting that both these stocks contain significant near-term risks. They are both plays on a recovery in the U.S. housing market, more than likely predicated on a decline in interest rates later in the year. However, the timing and magnitude of interest rate cuts are far from certain, and both companies could come under further pressure in the near term."", 'Suppose you are highly confident in a recovery in the housing market sooner rather than later, and you can tolerate some near-term risk. In that case, nothing stops you from buying both stocks. That way, you can diversify some stock-specific risk.', ""The deteriorating sales environment forced Whirlpool to pull forward promotional activity to clear inventory in 2023. As such, Whirlpool's margin performance was lower than previously expected last year. In addition, its guidance for 2024 could be described as mediocre at best. I've included Stanley Black & Decker's guidance for ease of reference and reiterating the current challenging conditions in the U.S. housing market."", '2024 Guidance', 'Whirlpool', 'Stanley Black & Decker', 'Sales Growth', 'Flat on an ongoing basis at $16.9 billion', 'A decline of 2% to an increase of 2%', 'Margin', 'Ongoing EBIT margin flat at 6.8%', 'Adjusted EBITDA to increase to 10% from 7.2% in 2022', 'Data source: Company presentations. EBIT is earnings before interest and taxation. EBITDA is earnings before interest, taxation, depreciation, and amortization.', ""However, Whirlpool isn't standing still, and after cost cuts of $800 million in 2023, management is aiming for another $300 million to $400 million in 2024."", ""Meanwhile, management plans to focus the business on its key profit generator, the North American market, as it plans to combine its European business with a subsidiary of Turkey's Arcelik into a new company, of which Whirlpool will retain a 25% stake. The deal has recently been provisionally approved by the U.K. government and is set to go ahead in April."", ""Management also plans for $500 million to $650 million in free cash flow (FCF), which will easily cover the dividend payout of $400 million, and the company's cash position is strong enough that management plans to reduce debt by $500 million."", ""It's a similar story at the tool maker. After the lockdown-inspired boom, the company faces a natural correction in demand alongside a declining DIY and professional tool market."", ""Management's plan involves $2 billion of cost cuts by the end of 2025 and significant inventory reduction. I covered the broad details of Stanley Black & Decker's plan earlier. As you see above, management's guidance for 2024 is mediocre on the revenue front, but Stanley's margins got hit so badly in the slowdown in 2022 that they are now in recovery mode."", 'Alongside the cost cuts, management is planning to continue reducing inventory. The company has reduced inventory by a whopping $1.9 billion since the plan was launched in 2022, with a $1.1 billion reduction in 2023. An inventory reduction of $400 million to $500 million is planned for 2024, helping the company to generate $600 million to $800 million in FCF, more than enough to cover the current dividend payout of some $480 million.', ""On balance, I think Whirlpool is better. I have three reasons why. First, Whirlpool's valuation is more attractive; it trades on less than 8 times estimated 2024 earnings and 7.2 times estimated 2025 earnings, compared to 21 times and 15 times for Stanley Black & Decker."", ""Second, its exit from the low-margin European market will potentially have more effect on margins over the long term than Stanley's more substantial cost cuts."", 'Third, the chart below shows the average number of days each company holds inventory before selling it (DIO) -- a lower number is better.', 'The chart shows Whirlpool is doing a much better job, and its DIO compares well historically.', ""All told, Whirlpool's upside potential looks greater. Its downside risk looks less because if both companies' sales collapse, Whirlpool will find it easier to reduce inventory. At the same time, Stanley Black & Decker could struggle."", 'Should you invest $1,000 in Whirlpool right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Whirlpool, consider this:', 'The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\xa010 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Whirlpool wasn’t one of them.

For today's Q&A session, we ask that each caller keep to 1 question and 1 follow-up to allow time for other participants.At this time, I will turn the call over to Vicente."", 'Vicente Reynal', ""Thanks, Matthew, and good morning to all. I would like to begin by acknowledging and thanking our employees for their hard work in helping us deliver another record year in 2023. We finished the year on a high note with strong fourth quarter and full year results despite the constantly changing macroeconomic environment.Our 2023 performance reinforces the impact our employee ownership mindset has for Ingersoll Rand. I would also like to welcome our new employees from our recent acquisition of Friulair whom I had the chance to visit last week in Italy. I was very impressed by the entrepreneurial and technological spirit that has made this company grow at an impressive organic CAGR of 15% over the past 3 years.Touching on Slide 3. In 2023, we demonstrated again how we continue to outperform against our long-term Investor Day commitments with double-digit growth in revenue, adjusted EBITDA, adjusted EPS and free cash flow. As we move to 2024, demand remained solid. And while macroeconomic and geopolitical uncertainties continue to be at the top of everyone's mind, we remain agile and focused on what we can control. IRX is our competitive differentiator. And combined with our ownership model, we remain confident in our ability to execute on our commitments. We recently held our Investor Day this past November and I'd like to spend a few minutes providing a couple of important highlights that we presented.On Slide 4, we highlighted how we deliver compounding results through our economic growth engine. With the use of IRX, we have created an increasingly durable financial profile, underpinned by our employee ownership model. Since 2016, we have transformed the company into a premier growth compounder. We have reduced cyclicality through divesting our Club Car and HPS businesses and reinvested approximately $2.3 billion into accretive acquisitions focused on high-growth sustainable end markets.Today, our balance sheet is stronger than ever, and we enter 2024, well positioned to build upon our progress to date. Moving to the next page, we show how we are uniquely positioned to grow market share within the $55 billion of highly fragmented addressable markets we currently play. The combination of our product portfolio, multichannel, multi-brand strategy, massive installed asset base and unmatched commercial and operational footprint provides an exceptional foundation for continued market share growth, both organically and inorganically.On Slide 6, we demonstrate how we remain committed to delivering financial performance while also doing good for the planet and our community. On the left-hand side of the page, we have some very exciting news to share. S&P Global recently announced that Ingersoll Rand ranked first in the world within our industry, up from #2 in the prior year. Also, Ingersoll Rand was named to the A List for its performance in tackling climate change and commitment to global environment leadership by CDP.CDP annual environmental disclosure and scoring process is globally recognized as the gold standard for corporate transparency. Finally, as shown on the right-hand side of the page, we continue to make progress towards our aggressive 2030 goals, and we're already well on our way to achieve them.On Slide 7, we show the catalyst for the progress, which is a highly engaged employee base combined with an ownership mindset. And as shown on the left-hand side of the page, our employee satisfaction is over 600 basis points higher than the industry average. We believe our employee ownership model drives the increased employee engagement. And as illustrated on the center of the page, we have created a massive economic opportunity for our employees and their families that has been life-changing for many as expressed on the quotes from some of them.All of this leads us to the next slide, where you can see that the combination of all these factors executed through our economic growth engine is evidence that our model provides durable long-term performance. Our portfolio is positioned to capitalize on global mega trends such as sustainability, digitalization and quality of life. We expect to leverage our organic growth enablers to deliver, on average, mid-single-digit organic growth through 2027. And as you can see, we outperformed this commitment again in 2023, delivering 10% year-over-year organic revenue growth. In 2023, we also delivered 6% of In-Year growth from M&A. The combined organic and inorganic growth of 16% far sort of passed, our low double-digit growth commitment. And only then we surpassed our growth targets, but we also exceeded our margin expansion initiatives, generating 170 basis points of adjusted EBITDA margin expansion and again, surpassing our long-term targets for this metric.With IRX, as our competitive differentiator and over 400 IMPACT daily management sessions or IDM, across our company each week, our high-performance culture encourages a strong focus on execution. In 2023, we delivered adjusted EPS growth of 25% and a free cash flow margin of 18%. These results prove that we are a premier durable growth compounder.On Slide 9, to date, we're on track or ahead of schedule in delivering the 2025 targets set at our previous Investor Day. We have set new aggressive targets for 2027 long-term financial and our results give us confidence in delivering those targets that are on average over the cycle.Turning to Slide 10. M&A continues to be at the forefront of our capital allocation strategy. We invested over $450 million across 13 acquisitions in 2023. These acquisitions have been both market-leading products and technologies while accelerating our addressable market with close adjacencies. As of today, we currently have 10 transactions under LOI. Our M&A funnel remains strong and continues to be over 5x larger than it was at the time of the RMP.We expect an additional 400 to 500 basis points of annualized inorganic revenue to be acquired in 2024. The 10 transactions currently under LOI are similar in size and nature to the bolt-on deals we have done over the past few years. However, outside of these 10 LOIs, we still have a couple of deals in the follow where the purchase price exceeds $1 billion.I will now turn the presentation over to Vik to provide an update on our Q4 and full year 2023 financial performance."", 'Vikram U. Kini', 'Thanks, Vicente. On Slide 11, we finished the year strong in Q4 through a balance of commercial and operational execution fueled by IRX despite the constantly changing macroeconomic environment. Total company organic orders and revenue increased 3% and 4% year-over-year, respectively. We remain encouraged by the strength of our backlog, which is up over 8% year-over-year. This presides us with a healthy backlog to execute on entering 2024 and gives us conviction in delivering our full year 2024 revenue guidance.The company delivered fourth quarter adjusted EBITDA of $501 million, a 19% year-over-year improvement and adjusted EBITDA margins of 27.5%, a 160 basis point year-over-year improvement and a 100 basis point improvement sequentially from Q3. Free cash flow for the quarter was $552 million, and for the year, we delivered nearly $1.3 billion of free cash flow with an 18% free cash flow margin and a 105% conversion to adjusted net income. Total liquidity of $3.6 billion at quarter end was up approximately $400 million sequentially.Our net leverage continues to improve both year-over-year and sequentially. At 0.6 turns, we are at 0.2 turns better than prior year and 0.3 turns better than prior quarter.Turning to Slide 12. For the total company on an FX adjusted basis, Q4 orders and revenue both grew 11%. Total company adjusted EBITDA increased 19% from the prior year. The ITS segment margin increased 260 basis points while the PST segment margin was flat year-over-year, and corporate costs came in at $47 million for the quarter. Finally, adjusted EPS for the quarter was up 19% to $0.86 per share. The adjusted tax rate for the quarter was 20.7%, with the full year adjusted rate finishing slightly above 22%.On Slide 13, total company full year orders grew 8% and revenue increased 17%, both on an FX adjusted basis. Total company adjusted EBITDA increased 25% from the prior year. The ITS segment margin increased 240 basis points, while the PST segment margin increased 130 basis points. Corporate costs finished the year at $173 million, driven by continued investments to support growth in areas like demand generation and IoT as well as the impact of incentive compensation adjustments.Lastly, adjusted EPS for the year was up 25% to $2.96 per share. Moving on to the next slide. Free cash flow for the quarter was $552 million, including CapEx, which totaled $30 million. Total liquidity now stands at $3.6 billion based on approximately $1.6 billion of cash and $2 billion of availability on our revolving credit facility. Leverage for the quarter was 0.6 turns, which was a 0.2 turn improvement year-over-year. And in 2023, we returned $295 million to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends.Specifically within the quarter, cash outflows included $130 million in share repurchases, $39 million deployed to M&A and $8 million for our dividend payment. M&A remains our top priority for capital allocation, and we continue to expect M&A to be our primary use of cash as we look ahead.I will now turn the call back to Vicente to discuss our segments.', 'Vicente Reynal', ""Thanks, Vik. On Slide 15, our Industrial Technologies and Services segment delivered solid year-over-year organic revenue growth of 5%. Adjusted EBITDA increased 26% year-over-year with an adjusted EBITDA margin of 30%, up 260 basis points from prior year with an incremental margin of 48%. We also delivered sequential margin expansion of 120 basis points from Q3 to Q4. It is important to note that we have already achieved our 2025 high 20s adjusted EBITDA margin target for ITS , which is a full 2 years ahead of schedule. We continue to see solid demand for our products with organic orders also up 5%.Moving to the product line highlights, compressors were up low double digits in orders and up mid-single digits in revenue. Industrial vacuum and blower were down low double digits in orders, but up low double-digit in revenue. The order decline was mainly driven by currently debooking an order from an electric truck manufacturer in Europe that had some battery supply issues.However, the prospects are starting to look better for this manufacturer in 2024. Also, it is important to highlight that core product lines continued to show strong momentum on a 2-year stack, excluding FX and also excluding the recent acquisition of SPX Air Treatment and Roots blower. On a 2-year stack, compressor orders were up mid-teens and revenue was up high 20s, industrial vacuum blower orders were up low double digits and revenue was up mid-30s.As a reminder, for additional detailed information on product lines and regional splits, we have more of the chart, which was previously included on this page to Slide 21 in the appendix. For our Innovation in Action section, we're highlighting a new compressor with advanced 2-stage technology. This product is a great example of how Ingersoll Rand is providing an innovative digitally enabled sustainable solution with a 17% energy efficiency improvement versus the competition.Turning to Slide 16. Organic revenue in the Precision and Science Technology segment was approximately flat year-over-year. The PST team delivered adjusted EBITDA of $94 million, which was up approximately 2% year-over-year with a margin of 30.1%. Organic orders were down 1.6%, driven by the Life Science businesses. We see organic orders growth stabilizing and we remain positive about the underlying health of the PST business. In fact, PST, excluding the Life Science businesses has seen positive organic orders and revenue growth in 11 out of the last 12 quarters.In addition, short cycle orders in the industrial businesses were up mid-single digits in Q4. Overall, the P&C segment remains on track to meet our long-term Investor Day growth commitments. For our PST Innovation in Action, we're highlighting our ARO piston pump system. This is a perfect example of leveraging both I2V and demand generation to pivot an existing product line into a high-growth, sustainable end market.Over the past 12 months, we have already taken $7 million in orders with a leading OEM solar panel producer, which has the potential for $1 million in annualized aftermarket revenue. As we move to Page 17, we're introducing our 2024 guidance. Total company revenue is expected to grow between 5% to 7%, with a first half growth of 4% to 6% and the second half growth of 6% to 8%. We anticipate organic growth of 2% to 4% where price is approximately 2/3 and volume 1/3. FX is expected to contribute approximately 1% of a tailwind for the year, of which the impact will be realized relatively evenly throughout the year.M&A is projected at $150 million, which reflects all complete and closed M&A transactions in 2023 as well as the acquisition of Friulair. Corporate costs are planned at $160 million and are expected to be incurred evenly per quarter throughout the year. Total adjusted EBITDA for the company is expected to be in the range of $1.915 billion and $1.975 billion. At the bottom of the table, adjusted EPS is projected to fall within the range of $3.14 and $3.24, which is approximately up 8% at the midpoint. We anticipate adjusted tax rate to be roughly 23%, gross interest expenses to be about $155 million and CapEx to be around 2% of revenue.On the right-hand side of the page, we have included the 2024 full year guidance bridge showing the growth associated with both operational activity and the impact associated with corporate costs, interest income and expenses, FX, share count and changes in the adjusted tax rate. And based on above guidance, adjusted EPS growth is expected to be 6% to 9%. As we sit here in mid-February, we would like to provide some commentary on Q1. We expect our normal seasonality to return in 2024 from a revenue perspective, which means that Q1 will be the lowest revenue quarter of the year.In addition, as a reminder, Q1 has a very tough comp, as we delivered 20% organic revenue growth in Q1 of 2023. As a result, we anticipate organic revenue growth to be flattish to slightly up for the quarter, with continued year-over-year margin expansion.Turning to Slide 18. As we wrap up on today's call, I want to reiterate that Ingersoll Rand is in a solid position. We continue to deliver record results and both our long-term and '24 guidance is reflective of our performance to date and our increasingly durable financial profile. To our employees, I want to thank you again for another excellent finish to the year.We delivered strong results by demonstrating our commitment to meeting our financial targets and executing our economic growth engine through the use of IRX. Thank you for your hard work, resiliency and focused actions. These results show the impact you each have as owners of the company. Our balance sheet is as strong as ever. And with our disciplined and comprehensive capital allocation strategy, we remain resilient and have the capacity to deploy capital to investments with the highest return as we continue our track record of market outperformance.We remain nimble, continue to monitor the dynamic market conditions and we're prepared for the challenges that may come. And with that, I'll turn the call back to the operator and open it for Q&A."", 'Operator', '(Operator Instructions) your first question comes from Mike Halloran with Baird.', 'Michael Patrick Halloran', ""So let's start with where you ended there on the guidance piece. Certainly, I appreciate all the context and help and understand the relatively normal seasonality. But maybe you could just talk to what you're embedding from an underlying assumption perspective when it comes to the broader environment, broader end markets. Is this a year where you just see relatively sequential stability. Any specific pockets you're concerned about or where you see opportunities for acceleration, Less of a Ingersoll specific question, meaning, I know you have a lot of drivers that you can use to goose growth relative to whatever the end markets are doing more of just an end market specific and an environment question."", 'Vicente Reynal', ""Yes, Mike, so maybe I'll kind of give you a perspective here on how we think about it by region first. I would say that in America, as expected, we're seeing much better momentum. I would say, Mainland Europe -- I want to say Americas, I mean not only the U.S. but even also Mexico and South America, where there's a lot of good progress going on with the teams down there.Mainland Europe remains relatively stable. I was just in Europe last week and really solid momentum from some good pockets of growth that we're seeing. But I'll say I'll call it more stable. I'll say, broader Middle East and India, very -- also very good momentum, I mean, particularly in India. And you've seen that we have done quite a few investments in India too as well, not only from an inorganic perspective, but also organic. And I'll say that APAC, Asia Pacific is the one that has the most headwinds, specifically, I would say, here in the first half of the year and is driven mainly by tough comps. I mean we saw strong double-digit organic revenue growth in the first half of 2023 in Asia Pacific, mainly driven by China. And at this point in time, I mean, China is not a market that we call it, that is perhaps booming.We're not immune to that, but we expect to outperform the market there too as well as the teams have proven that they could do that even in 2023. So that's kind of from a regional perspective, I say from an end market perspective, nothing that I would call out to be highly differentiated in a sense because you have seen us always pivot to these high-growth sustainable end markets. We gave you 1 very good example here with ARO piston pump. This is a legacy product line that we kind of reinvigorated. We utilize I2V as a way to relaunch that product. And with the use of demand generation, we were able to position that product line into a very good growth end market on photovoltaic cells. So I'd say, Mike, I mean I think the playbook continues to be the same. It's be agile, very nimble, leverage demand generation and IRX as a way to continue to execute."", 'Michael Patrick Halloran', ""No, that makes sense. And then a follow-up on the Life Science side. The 1 area of PST that, like a lot of the folks are seeing some headwinds here. You listen to what the bigger players in the industry are saying there's more stability front halfs improvement back half, at least modest. Is that still under what your expectations are from a recovery curve at this point?"", 'Vicente Reynal', ""That's kind of what we think too as well, Mike. Again, as you said, maybe bottoming out here as we kind of come into the first half and then seeing sequential improvement. I don't say -- I mean, not in an exponential way. I mean there's not that pent-up demand. But I would say in a very logical way to get back to the good growth that these end markets should continue to see over the long term."", 'Operator', 'Your next question comes from Julian Mitchell with Barclays.', 'Julian C.H. Mitchell', ""Just first off, just wanted to look at the sort of cadence through the year, perhaps first off. So based on what you said, is it fair to assume sort of first quarter is about 21% of earnings for the year. And when we're looking at kind of incremental margins, you called out that high 30s figure for the year. Is that kind of fairly steady across both segments as we move through 2024?"", 'Vikram U. Kini', ""Yes. Julian, this is Vik. I'll take the first part of your question, and I'll let Vicente probably talk on the margin front. I think the phasing -- generally, I think you're right -- you're in the right ballpark. Maybe the other way to say it here is if you look at the phasing in a manner that's consistent with, I'd say, revenue and earnings delivery as we saw in 2023, I think you'd be in the right ballpark in terms of our expectations here for 2024. And then in terms of the incremental margin piece, maybe started or..."", 'Vicente Reynal', ""Yes. I can take that. I mean -- I think the way I think about that incremental margin, I mean, think about that 35% to 40% incremental margin. And when you look at the main buckets, I'd say, the first bucket of that improvement or good incremental margin comes in from the initiatives that we always do will be I2V, price, very good continued growth momentum on the aftermarket, particularly the recurring revenues.The second bucket will be around the prior M&A improvement activities that we have always spoken about. The third bucket is you probably saw on some of the appendix that we did some proactive restructuring at the end of 2023. This is kind of part of our -- always continue to be proactive and nimble. And the last fourth bucket, I would say, in terms of this margin improvement is around corporate cost. You saw corporate costs going down roughly $13 million or so."", 'Julian C.H. Mitchell', ""That's helpful. And just as we're starting out the year, looking at orders, naturally, the sort of volatile quarter-to-quarter, reflecting what you said on a sort of a tough Asia environment in the first half of the year and sort of very tough orders comps. Do we think about kind of orders being down perhaps in the first quarter year-on-year and then you pick up after that as the comps and perhaps Asia get better?"", 'Vicente Reynal', ""So as you see, we typically don't guide on the orders for the year or on a quarterly basis, but we do definitely expect orders to be up sequentially from Q4 to Q1 on an absolute dollar perspective. And the way we think about it too as well is that we typically book above 1 on a book-to-bill in the first half, due typically to larger longer-cycle projects being booked and then below 1 in the second half. But -- and we don't anticipate 2024 to be any different to that."", 'Operator', 'Your next question comes from Jeff Sprague with Vertical Research.', 'Jeffrey Todd Sprague', 'Vicente, can we just come back to Life Sciences for a moment and just level set us here now after kind of a couple of tough years, what percent of PST is that business now? And do you actually expect it to return to growth in 2024?', 'Vicente Reynal', 'So the Life Science business is roughly 25% to 30% of the PST segment today. And I think as we think about going into the second half is when we expect that to be getting back to a normal growth.', 'Jeffrey Todd Sprague', ""Right. And then just -- thanks for the guidance on price versus volume. Can you just give a little bit of color on what you're expecting just kind of the price cost equation as we move through the year and maybe particularly in ITS."", 'Vikram U. Kini', ""Yes, Jeff, this is Vik. I'll take that one. I think simply stated here, I don't think you're going to see anything dramatically different than what you've seen historically, meaning we expect to generate approximately 2% price on a full year basis. We would expect to be both dollar and margin positive from a price cost perspective each quarter of 2024.So again, nothing different in terms of that equation as we move to the year. And obviously, ITS being the bigger segment, clearly, that comment pertains to ITS as well as PST as well."", 'Operator', 'Your next question comes from Rob Wertheimer with Melius Research.', 'Robert Cameron Wertheimer', ""Actually, one more question on Life Science. I mean we've seen you guys use demand generation in just IRX to outgrow tough markets in China and maybe Europe last year. Has that been a factor in life science? Is there anything different in that market that constrains it. And I wonder if you could just kind of compare market dynamics for you and Life Sciences to some of the other companies in Industrials, we've seen in a long drag. What does the recovery look like? Is there a bounce back? Has there been a -- I mean maybe just explain the sales dynamic there."", 'Vicente Reynal', ""Yes, Rob, I'll say Life Sciences, and I think you were referring to, particularly in China. I mean, they have seen similar declines like the balance of the Life Science businesses and biopharma-related markets. And I would say, for the balance of our China exposure, it isn't that much different than the impact we have seen on the ITS side with the 1 item of note to call out perhaps [CPCS] business that is more impacted by the water market. But that being said, I mean, we're excited with the prospect of CPCS in China. And 1 example of that is that again, pivoting to better end markets. So for example, the CPCS took the same product and relaunched that to move away from the water market and move more into the lithium battery production with a very unique proposition without having to reconfigure that product too much.So I think we just continue to navigate that. I mean basically, how do we continue to agile and very nimbly move from one [air] market to the other without having to reconstruct the product lines."", 'Robert Cameron Wertheimer', ""Yes. So it was a little bit of too. So it was like does demand generation -- has demand generation or other tools allowed you to outgrow the decline in Life Sciences. And then maybe just -- maybe it's the same question as Jeff asked in a way, but does the other side of this look like a bounce back? Or does it just look like a return to normal growth? I don't know whether destock or whatever at your customers had led to below normal sales and you kind of pop back up in '25 or whether you just presume normal growth. I will stop there."", 'Vicente Reynal', ""Sure. No, great. To the first question, absolutely, the man generation is really helping us tremendously because then think about -- I mean, our products can be applicable to pretty much any end market and we're being very selective. And with demand generation, we can really reach this highly fragmented customer base in a very cost-effective way, very rapid very quickly and then provide a better solution to our customers underneath call it, energy efficiency, water efficiency, digitalization, all these thematics that we think are important.For the second question, we kind of -- the way we think about it is more normal. We don't expect this massive bounce back. If that happens, clearly, upside, but the way we like to view it is more normal."", 'Operator', 'Your next question comes from Andy Kaplowitz with Citigroup.', 'Andrew Alec Kaplowitz', 'I think you had an increase in your LOIs in Q4 to 10, I think, from 4 last quarter. Are you seeing the M&A market open up a bit more? Is this more your team just finding more deals? And those couple of deals that you mentioned that over $1 billion, do you see the larger deal market opening up? Or is it still difficult to get those larger ones over the finish line?', 'Vicente Reynal', ""So I would say that, yes, I mean the M&A, we feel that continues to open up. And again, I'll put it in perspective that these 10 transactions in the LOI are similar in size and nature to the bolt-on deals that we have done over the past few years. And these 10 LOIs are also sole source, meaning we have been proactively talking to the family on and have built some incredible relationships. This is exactly what happened with the Friulair acquisition too as well, which I've been in contact with the founder named Luigi. So but -- so again, outside of this eye, we still have a couple of those deals in the funnel where purchase price exceeds $1 billion.So yes, there's still -- I mean, timing of that, obviously difficult, but we still have a couple of those in our funnel. I will also tell you that we actually also we walked away from 1 of those $1 billion purchase price transactions. -- which again speaks to the prudency and the discipline of our continued model that even after 6 to 9 months of continued diligence, we decided that it was just not the best case for us to proceed. So we remain highly disciplined in this environment, and we see just a lot of good opportunities are there."", 'Andrew Alec Kaplowitz', ""That's very helpful. And then can you give us more color in terms of the end markets, you answered the question before, but if I look at Americas and EMEA, pretty continued durable growth. Is it more than 20% of your business that's longer cycle, larger compressors? Is it more of the short-cycle stuff that's supporting your growth? And what do you think the sustainability of the 2 markets is."", 'Vicente Reynal', ""Yes, I think -- we think that maybe over the past couple of years, it was a lot more on the longer cycle. We see now perhaps as you kind of continue to see PMIs do better is that shorter to medium cycle, we'll continue to see maybe a better momentum. So inflecting, we see some of that even already here. And you saw we spoke about that, particularly, let's say, even PST on that we said the industrial shorter cycle up mid-single digits year-over-year and then also sequentially. So I think -- yes, I mean, I would say that our teams continue to stay pretty agile in these -- in continuing to pursue energy efficiency in the compressors with our story around how we can save tremendous amount of energy. That is a very good thematic that continues to be out there, thematic around reshoring, very strong, continues to be the case in countries even like Mexico or even South America. But -- so I think the same thematics are still happening that we've been talking about for the past couple of years, Andy."", 'Operator', 'Your next question comes from Nigel Coe with Wolfe Research.', 'Nigel Edward Coe', ""So all the big questions, I think have been asked, but maybe just give us a bit of color on what you're seeing in China, looks like that was down in the quarter. So maybe just quantify that and kind of like what's your sort of base case view on China? And then perhaps as part of that first half versus second half, it looks like core growth, flat to 2% in the first half of the year, and then we're going to lift the mid-single-digits in the back half of the year. Is that simply easier comps? Or are we seeing some acceleration, I don't know, maybe in China perhaps in Life Sciences. Any color there?"", 'Vicente Reynal', ""Yes. I mean -- so China -- I was actually in China a few weeks ago earlier here in January with the team, and we were doing the pre-celebration of the Chinese happy new year. So but in addition to just reviewing how the business is performing. And to keep that in mind, I mean I was -- I think over the past 6 to 9 months, I've been to China now 3 or 4 times. So I think it's just 1 that we continue to stay really close to understand how our teams continue to control what we can control.So from an orders perspective, yes, I mean, China in the fourth quarter was down mid-single digits. But keep in mind that this is on top of like a low double-digit orders growth that they saw in Q4 2022. So again, I think on a 2-year stack, they still saw high single-digit order momentum, which is pretty impressive. When you consider everything that is going on in China today. I will categorize the environment in China this time that I went to much better than what I saw in 2023. In the sense that there seems to be the teams are reenergized about maybe what's happening in terms of the stimulus and how the teams continue to leverage our technology into other end markets that they see some good pockets of growth.So I was very encouraged to see how the team continues to navigate that difficult market by being very nimble and agile in terms of pivoting to those areas of good growth."", 'Vikram U. Kini', ""Yes. Nigel, on the second part of your question about the kind of the growth cadence first half for second half. Yes, probably of factors I would point to; one being first and foremost, we do walk into the year with a still healthy backlog, including a good percentage of that, that's longer cycle in nature. So that obviously gives us some good visibility into the back half of the year when a lot of those projects tend to more naturally ship. And then yes, I do think there's a lot of truth in the statement you made about, clearly, comps get a little bit more moderate in the back half of the year. kind of across the board. But clearly, whether it be China as well as the Life Sciences side of the equation on the PST business.So I think it's a couple of different factors. But again, like we said before, we think the phasing of delivery of revenue and earnings is actually very consistent in '24 versus what you've seen historically."", 'Nigel Edward Coe', ""That's great color. My follow-up question is the strength in European compressor orders is remarkable considering what's going on in the economy there. So if you had to rank order these 3 Scope 1 emission targets, CO2 pricing, and high energy prices. What do you -- obviously, IRX on top of that. But if you had to rank those 3, what would you say is the most important factor."", 'Vicente Reynal', ""I would say high energy prices and Scope 1, which are kind of interrelated one with the other one. And -- but yes, I'd say high energy prices, #1, Scope 1 in terms of targets that many of the companies have put out there. And then the third would be around the CO2."", 'Operator', 'Your next question comes from Joe Ritchie with Goldman Sachs.', 'Joseph Alfred Ritchie', ""So nice end to the year, obviously, incremental margins were great. You hit your margin targets 2 years ahead of time. So if you think about this ITS business now, and I know that you have this incremental margin target for the year of 35% to 40%. I guess I'm just curious -- like how much of that would you say is volume dependent at this point? I know IRX is all about continuous improvement, but just your ability to just deliver continued margin expansion if the volumes ultimately turn out to be weaker than expected."", 'Vicente Reynal', ""Joe, I'd say that -- I mean, even when you think about our guidance, I mean, it just shows that lower growth, but still generating a very good margin. And that's driven by the activities that we have done, call it I2V also price and even aftermarket. So I think those are 3 core initiatives that we have continued to do really well -- we always said that the ITS was very well ahead because that was part of the integration between Gardner Denver and IR on how we did those 3 initiatives prioritize there. What I can tell you, I mean, the PST team, like even 2 weeks ago, they had like a worldwide I2V event and it was just highly, highly encouraging to see how our new leader is just driving that type of methodology into a segment that in the past, they did it, but not in a way that we like that to be done. And in addition, I think what you saw here in the fourth quarter is that we took some proactive surgical -- what we call surgical restructuring at the end of the year. And again, that's a prudency for us to continue to protect the P&L. So I think that's controlling what we can control and taking the actions to ensure that we can deliver that solid margin improvement."", 'Joseph Alfred Ritchie', ""That's helpful. Vicente, and look, it sounds like you've been on the road (inaudible) in the last several weeks. I'm curious just from a regulatory standpoint, are there any kind of change in regulations that you guys are seeing across any particular region that might be impacting your business or could impact your business going forward in the next, we'll call it, next 12 to 24 months?"", 'Vicente Reynal', ""I mean, nothing that I would say of significant dramatic change that is new. I mean we know about clearly the energy efficiency standards that are coming into effect by the further above in the U.S. There's some refrigeration standards that are -- that will drive basically our air treatment business. I would view it in a positive way, driven first in Europe and then in the U.S. too as well. But those are kind of known that we have known for a little while and -- but they're not new."", 'Operator', 'Your next question comes from Steve Volkmann with Jefferies.', 'Stephen Edward Volkmann', ""Maybe just a couple of longer-term ones here. Just kind of going back to orders and backlog now that the world is sort of normalizing again, over some period, should we expect backlog to decline? Or do you think it's kind of at the rate that it should be going forward?"", 'Vicente Reynal', ""Yes. I would that mean so good news is that clearly, we're still a pretty high backlog which is encouraging to see. I think over time, perhaps yes, it will get normalized. But again, I think that when we think about the business that -- if we continue to get this book-to-bill of 1 -- of approximately 1 that we continue to expect to see here in 2024. I think backlogs seem to be continuing at a pretty higher level than what we have done historically."", 'Vikram U. Kini', ""The only thing I would say there is -- with the amount of -- something said, with some of the longer cycle, we do fundamentally feel that compared to years in the past, there is just a higher amount of our backlog. That's the longer cycle projects, which then clearly leads to the level of backlog you have now.So I think that you have seen a little bit of a structural change in the composition of the backlog as compared to more historic times."", 'Stephen Edward Volkmann', ""Got it. Okay. And then switching gears a little bit. companies that are acquisitive and sort of have this flywheel that you guys have occasionally, something comes over the transom that isn't quite what you thought it was going to be, and you may have a little disappointment in some pieces of some business or something. So I'm just curious, any lessons learned, anything like that happening? And more importantly, should we expect some level of divestitures to be kind of part of this machine as we go forward?"", 'Vikram U. Kini', ""Steve, I'll start on that. So you've seen us now since the merger done, we've done over 40 transactions. And obviously, not all of them have been 100% the same. But what we would say here is, and we've acknowledged this before, probably the ones that maybe were maybe slightly below expectations, comparatively speaking, are probably the ones where IRX and that integration process probably didn't get embedded from day 1, if not before.So if the lesson learned here is we've got a playbook, whether it's an ITS acquisition or PST acquisition, we're going to continue to deploy that playbook on the IRX side because we fundamentally view that as the catalyst for success in terms of the integration and really embedding those businesses within the core."", 'Vicente Reynal', ""Yes. And the only thing that I would add to add to as well is that I think we said this before, but my staff meeting, which happens typically on Fridays, it's run as an IDM part of the IRX and 1 of the areas of focus is basically we have a dashboard of all the M&As that are getting integrated, where we can clearly see if there's any issues or gaps. And that was an implementation that we did a few -- quite a few months ago, I'm gonna say 18 months ago as we saw maybe some businesses that were not properly integrated. So I think it's just part of that, as Vik said, continuos improvement, good evolution and having the news travel fast so that we can react and course correct if something is not going the right way."", 'Operator', 'Your next question comes from Chris Snyder with UBS.', 'Christopher M. Snyder', 'I wanted to also ask on the M&A engine and maybe a more high-level one. So revenue in 2024 is going to be about 40% above 2021. Does that make it more difficult for the company to add this 400 to 500 basis points M&A contribution every year? And does it change anything around the process of doing so just as the numbers have, I guess, gotten 40% bigger versus 3 years ago to keep that same run rate.', 'Vicente Reynal', ""Yes, Chris, I would say that -- I mean, it will become more difficult. I would say that when you think about it back in 2021, I think our addressable market back in that Investors Day, we said it was maybe, what, $25 billion, $30 billion and you saw our most recent Investor Day, our addressable market being $55 billion. So -- so clearly, when we make an acquisition, we look at it also from a perspective of are we able to increase the addressable market and by increasing the addressable market, we're doing it in a highly fragmented market that gives us a greater pool of transactions to be able to be acquired. We're always very thoughtful on how we -- on this kind of flywheel on the M&A engine as just being 1 that is just not it's an ongoing engine that can continue to grow.And I think that's in terms of statistics and data points, that's why we track a number of transactions by [Tollgate] and with the probability. So I think the cadence of that M&A, it's pretty solid. And in terms of changing in the process, I mean nothing that I will say has been dramatic change. We continue to always make some tweaks and improvements like I think about a year ago, we spoke about how we look at about 100 micro trends, and that leads into new M&A transactions that we can actually possibly do.So we're always trying to continue to evolve our process to make it better on an ongoing basis. So changing the process, yes, because we are always continually improving the way we do things."", 'Christopher M. Snyder', ""I appreciate that. And then maybe just follow up on productivity and efficiency of the business. Obviously, margins have been really strong here in the last 3 to 4 years. Do you feel like the efficiency of manufacturing has returned to pre-COVID levels. Obviously, there's a lot of disruption coming out of the pandemic, which I'm sure was a headwind to margins in some capacity. Do you feel like that is fully back at this point?"", 'Vicente Reynal', ""I mean -- I don't think so. Only because I mean, I think still there's a little bit of supply chain disruption here and there that happens, right? And so giving you, for example, I mean, the situation with the Red Sea, the situation in the Panama Canal, a lot of that creates supply chain disruption. And we're -- we, as a company that we're so global and being so good on terms of assembly. Any time a supply to change disruption, it creates inefficiencies in the factory.So I'd say that it is not back to the normal stability that we have seen maybe pre-COVID. That's my view. And I think also we're pretty critical, Chris, in terms of how we want to continue to improve our factories and our operations. Is that a lean mindset that of continuous improvement that always view that, hey, we always have to do better than what we did in the past."", 'Operator', ""Your next question comes from Joe O'Dea with Wells Fargo."", ""Joseph John O'Dea"", ""I wanted to just start on the growth algorithm. And if we think about a couple of points of price and a point of volume and just how you're thinking about the overall macro and the type of growth that you have kind of underlying on the volume side. Really, just trying to understand how much demand generation is embedded in this initial guide? Is that 1 point of volume reflective of outgrowth? Or -- or is there potential sort of upside on the demand generation side of things?"", 'Vikram U. Kini', ""Yes, Joe, I'll start with that one. I think we always view that there's upside on the demand gen side and frankly, even on the volume side, let me kind of unpack that a little bit. I think, Vicente, mentioned earlier, when you look at the regional trends here, with [Primerica] is kind of at the top of the stack, EMEA relatively more stable and APAC, which is largely China for us, probably facing the most headwind, at least as we enter the year, that's kind of the balanced equation that we looked at as we thought about the growth algorithm, as you said.Now that being said, we entered the year with healthy backlog, solid backlog demand generation without question is part of the equation here. And clearly, we would say not too dissimilar from, frankly, even years past, if there's upside opportunity in the context of the guide or in the context of the year, it really probably more so becomes that organic volume piece, probably more so as the year progresses. So again, I don't think the equation for us is dramatically different than you've seen historically. But we are conscious and taking into consideration some of the regional trends that we're seeing, particularly as we enter the year, and we're going to continue to monitor those and pulse those as we get through the quarter and into second quarter and the back half of the year."", ""Joseph John O'Dea"", ""Understood. And then on ITS margins in the 30% in the fourth quarter, if you could kind of unpack that a little bit and bridging that sequential improvement from 3Q to 4Q. And then also just to clarify, it sounds like the 35% to 40% incremental supplies to both segments. And so it's not like that exit rate sets up a tough incremental comp. I'm not sure if there was any restructuring that sort of hit the ITS side or if that was more on the PST side, but just some details there would be helpful."", 'Vikram U. Kini', ""Yes. Sure. Maybe I'll take those in pieces here. So If my memory serves it correctly, went from a 28.8% EBITDA margin to about 30%, a little over 100 basis points sequential margin expansion from Q3 to Q4. I'd point to a couple of things here. One, frankly, the revenue and volume levels tend to pace through the year, a lot of our productivity measures are tied to volume.So when you see a heavier shipment quarter like you saw in Q4 as compared to Q3, you should expect things like some of the productivity measures the I2V to follow. I'd say that's probably 1 of the single biggest drivers, I think price cost continue to remain quite positive and overall, the strong solid execution as we exited the year. The other thing that I think we continue to see good, what I'd say, momentum on is the aftermarket side. And that really sets up nicely even during the Investor Day, we indicated that aftermarket as well as the whole recurring revenue side of the equation is a big focal point for us, and we would expect to continue to see that not only ramp as we think about the next few years, but also that being margin accretive in the overall equation.So again, I think that's probably the way that we think about the equation in terms of what kind of drove Q4 specifically. Now in terms of the whole incrementals and how we think about 2024, like we said, 35% to 40% is the kind of the overall average. The way I'd probably think about it here is ITS is probably playing maybe towards the lower end of that, probably in the 30s around PST obviously probably has a little bit more outsized opportunity, but I think that also goes with the fact that we said that while we're pleased with PST delivering 30% EBITDA margins, in the full year of 2023. We know that, that business can get up into that mid-30s realm and as such, there should be a little bit more of an outpaced opportunity.So there's a little bit of puts and takes there as well as, as Vicente mentioned earlier, a little bit of upside on the corporate cost as we think year-over-year. So hopefully, that kind of gives you a little bit of a sense of how we're thinking about the year planning itself out."", 'Operator', 'Next question comes from Nathan Jones from Stifel.', 'Nathan Hardie Jones', ""A couple of fairly narrow questions. I know one of the strategic additions you've made in M&A has been to add drawing to the portfolio. So I was just hoping to get an update on the benefits that you're seeing there, revenue synergies that you're generating there, whether or not you think that portfolio is built out or it's still an opportunity to add more of that capability?"", 'Vicente Reynal', ""Yes, Nathan, it's definitely a very exciting addition to -- and you have seen that we made quite a few acquisitions on that. I mean not only the SPX Flow Air Teatment side, Oxywise, we acquired Holtec, we acquired a couple of years ago and now 3 Friulair a well. And then in China, even also Hanye and the reason for this is that because Air Teatment is very good from the perspective of being attached to a compressor. If you think about the attachment rate, it should be like 70% attached to a compressor.So clearly, that's -- in terms of a KPI of a metric that we use with our teams is exactly that. One is the attachment rate when you say a compressor, how often are you attaching that air treatment to that. And that definitely drives some good growth momentum. And then to think about it too as well, air treatment is roughly 50% of aftermarket. So it generates a very good solid aftermarket. So a combination of those 2 factors, we like it a lot. And then the third item of why we like it is because you can actually optimize energy efficiencies much better when you have the combination of the compressor and the air treatment, talking to each other in a common way and being remotely connected and then fine-tuning that connectivity. So I think there's multiple levers of strategic growth that we see on this driver portfolio."", 'Operator', 'Your next question comes from David Raso with Evercore ISI.', 'David Michael Raso', 'Just a couple of quick questions. A clarification on the M&A comment. I thought I heard the word incremental 400 to 500, but you already have 2% to 2.5% of acquired revenues booked that will flow through this year. Was that truly 400 to 500 above what you already booked or just getting up to the framework of 400 to 500 basis points of acquired revenues. If you can just clarify that?', 'Vikram U. Kini', ""Yes, David, let me take that. So I think take them in pieces here. So you obviously have the carryover as well as the Friulair Acquisition. So you see in our guidance the approximately $160 million of revenue contribution. That's the carryover and the completed to date obviously, we'd expect to book to close more acquisitions as the year goes by. But embedded in the guidance is that $160 million. The comment about 400 to 500 would be the acquisitions that we expect to make in the year and the annualized revenue contribution. So for all the deals that we expect to make here based on the funnel and all the comments that Vicente Made, we would expect that to be 400 to 500 basis points on an annualized basis. So you should take those kind of 2 statements separate from each other. But again, I think the short answer here is we expect to continue to operate well in line with our stated economic growth engine and how you've seen us operate in years past."", 'David Michael Raso', ""I just wanted clarification on that. And on the call out to that EV truck manufacturer in Europe on the vacuum and blower order weakness, you made a comment like prospects are improving potentially for that again. Just so I'm clear, do you think that order could come back on the books because it seems to be of some size must be $20 million, $30 million or so, not small. Is that something that can come back on the books?"", 'Vikram U. Kini', ""Yes, let me take the first part of that and I'll Vicente answer it. The way I would describe it is, interestingly enough, we debooked it in Q4 of '23 and the original order happened to have come in Q4 '22. So interesting enough to kind of it hit us both ends, both in the quarter as well as the comp. So Vicente, I want you speak to the prospects going forward."", 'Vicente Reynal', ""Yes. And the prospect going forward is that, I mean we're still in touch with them. I mean, basically, they had a situation where the battery supplier went bankrupt and that led to these truck manufacturing not being able to produce the trucks. Needless to say, what we're seeing now is that it's been acquired, the assets have been acquired -- they have great technology. I mean, this is for the last mile delivery trucks in Europe, which is very highly needed. And so the conversations continue to happen, which obviously means that there could be some good prospects here as we go into 2024."", 'Operator', 'Your last question comes from Nicole DeBlase from Deutsche Bank.', 'Nicole Sheree DeBlase', 'Maybe just starting with the free cash question. So conversion of 100% all the CapEx plans. How are you guys thinking about working capital for 2024?', 'Vikram U. Kini', ""Sure. I think in the call, I think broad strokes here, we still see an opportunity here. I think is the long and short of it. While we were pleased with our kind of exit momentum ending out '23, particularly on the inventory side, was very much a source of cash in the quarter. We frankly still sit at elevated levels, comparatively speaking to, I'd say, the pre-supply chain dynamics and things of that nature.So I think that's definitely an opportunity as well as I'd say some of the just core -- I'll just call it blocking and tackling, whether that be just kind of the collections and things of that nature, Fair to say that we still have a component of our portfolio part of the PST organization as well as a lot of some of the bolt-on M&A, that's not in the shared service environment, which obviously, for us, is a big catalyst of working capital improvement. So you put that all together, I think that still lends itself as a good source of opportunity for '24 and beyond."", 'Nicole Sheree DeBlase', ""And then -- and just -- it doesn't look like you guys have any buybacks in the guidance based on the share count outlook. So how is your view on potential buyback activity in 2024?"", 'Vikram U. Kini', ""Yes, that's correct. We do not have any, I would say, incremental buybacks as part of the guidance. Now that being said, I think the way you should expect us to operate here in 2024 is similar to the prior years, meaning a requisite amount approximately. We've always said approximately $250 million is probably a good proxy and a placeholder in terms of expectations for the year. But you are correct that it's not formally in the guidance."", 'Operator', ""There are no further questions at this time. I will now turn the call back to Ingersoll Rand's CEO, Vicente Reynal for any closing remarks."", 'Vicente Reynal', ""Yes. Thank you, [Briana]. And as we wrap up here, I just want to pass 1 more thank you to our employees who will continue to think and act like owners because they are owners of the company. And it's very exciting to see as I travel around the world, the high level of engagement and energy that we have across our organization.I think our economic growth engine is powered by that momentum on the ownership mindset and leveraging our IR. So Again, very encouraged, very happy and to see the performance and look forward to another great year here in 2024. Thank you."", 'Operator', ""This concludes today's conference call.

Second, for our Wine & Spirits business, we now expect a decline of 7% to 9% in organic net sales and a decline of 6% to 8% in operating income, excluding the impact of the divested wine brands that are no longer part of our results. Bill also already addressed the drivers for these revisions. Third, from a corporate expense perspective, we now expect that to be approximately $260 million to $270 million for the full year which includes a slightly lower end to the range versus our prior expectation.', 'And similarly, our interest expense expectations are now slightly lower at approximately $450 million. And last but not least, we continue to expect our comparable effective tax rate, excluding Canopy, to be approximately 19% and despite the additional $215 million of share repurchases executed in the third quarter, we also continue to anticipate weighted average diluted shares outstanding to be approximately $184 million. Beyond the P&L, for free cash flow, we expect to be in the range of $1.4 billion to $1.5 billion for fiscal ’24, reflective of $2.6 billion to $2.8 billion in operating cash flow and $1.2 billion to $1.3 billion of CapEx. In closing, we continue to deliver industry-leading results in our beer business and remain confident in our ability to achieve our stated EPS targets for this fiscal year despite incremental category headwinds affecting our Wine & Spirits business.', 'As we look further ahead, we remain excited about continuing opportunities to build shareholder value over the medium term, which we hope to achieve by capturing the substantial growth opportunities that exist for our Beer business, executing against our consistent, disciplined and balanced capital allocation priorities and delivering enhanced performance in Wine & Spirits, supported by the significant transformation that business has undergone and the actions that we are taking to improve this business.""', 'Read the entire earnings call transcript here.', '\xa0', 'Click to continue reading and see Jim Cramer’s Top 5 Stock Picks This Week.', '\xa0', 'Suggested Articles:', 'Jim Cramer’s 11 Latest Stock Picks', 'Jim Cramer Says You Should Stay Away from These 10 Stocks', 'Jim Cramer is Bearish on These 12 Stocks', ""Disclosure.\xa0None.\xa0Jim Cramer's Top 10\xa0Stock Picks This Week\xa0was initially published on Insider Monkey.""]"

Aggregate shipments in the fourth quarter increased 2%, compared to a week prior year quarter that was impacted by abnormal wet and cold weather. Aggregates freight adjusted price improved 14% in the quarter, pushing the year-to-date average selling price to $19 per ton, $2.60 per ton increase over the prior year. Freight-adjusted unit cash cost of sales increased 7% compared to the prior year quarter.', 'This Marked a third consecutive quarter of trailing 12 month deceleration in year-over-year cost.

Inflationary cost pressures continue to moderate and we expect freight-adjusted unit cash cost to increase mid-single-digit in 2024 resulting in an attractive mid-teens improvement and cash gross profit per ton. On the demand side, we continue to expect a moderate decline in 2024 with aggregate shipments forecasted land within a range of flat to down 4% for the full year.

I'll start with residential, which has quickly entered recovery mode single-family housing permits and starts return to growth in the second half of last year and momentum is accelerating across our footprint. We expect the strength in single-family construction activity be offset by weaker multifamily starts as they pull back from historically high levels. Overall, the underlying fundamentals for residential construction activity remained firmly in place.

Andrews?"", 'Mary Andrews Carlisle: Thanks, Tom and good morning. Our strong operational and strategic execution in 2023 set us up well to continue our long track record of growth through disciplined capital allocation and consistent execution. Over the last 10 years, we increased our revenues at an annual growth rate of 11%; grew our adjusted EBITDA at an annual growth rate of 16% percent; strengthened our free cash flow generation at an annual growth rate of 23%; and improved our return on invested capital by 1000 basis points.

Now Mary Andrews and I will be happy to take your questions."", 'Operator', ""(Operator Instructions). And we'll take our first question from the line of Trey Grooms with Stephens."", 'Trey Grooms', ""Good morning, Tom and Mary Andrews. I guess I wanted to touch on Aggregates pricing here. Obviously, a very strong performance last year and it looks like you're looking for another year of double-digit growth ahead here for pricing. So Tom, what's driving the confidence there as we move into '24 on the pricing outlook?"", 'James Thomas Hill', ""Trey, I think we saw a fundamental change in our markets in 2022. We realized in March of 2022 that we had runaway inflation. And so we took the lead in 2022 and pull mid-year prices forward to May 1 that year in every market. And then follow that up with we pulled all the 2023 price increases to January 1 where some of it been April 1. So I think today, the fundamentals for pricing is very, very good. And I think embedded in those fundamentals are three clear changes that we're seeing in our markets. One, there's more discipline in announced price increases. Two, our Aggregates price increases are now January, not April 1. And third, our midyear price increase conversations are expected in all markets. So we're in a really good place in pricing. It's probably a good place as we've been historically. And you couple that with the tools and disciplines of the Vulcan Way of Selling, I think our future looks very good."", 'Mary Andrews Carlisle', ""Yes. Trey, I'll just add that headline pricing is one thing, but as we always like to remind people, the important thing is taking that price to the bottom line. And our 2023 cash gross profit per ton improved over 20% and expecting another year of attractive growth in 2024 in the mid-teens range. I think this shows our execution has us making quick progress towards our $11 to $12 target at much lower tonnage. So the compounding nature of this business really showcases its durability and I think the continuous opportunity for strong organic growth."", 'Operator', 'Our next question comes from the line of Stanley Elliott with Stifel.', 'Stanley Stoker Elliott', ""Congratulations on the quarter and the outlook. Last question was a perfect lead-in. I was curious if you guys could talk a little bit more about kind of what you're seeing on the cost side, maybe how does this mid-single-digit sort of cost inflation that you're expecting in the coming year come together? Any puts and takes there would be great."", 'James Thomas Hill', ""Thanks, Stanley. You saw the cost in the fourth quarter was up 7%, and that's down from what we've been seeing as low double-digit in prior quarters. I think it was like the third quarter (inaudible) started to come down. So what we're seeing is the impact of inflation started to dampen. As we said, we saw -- we see this year in mid-single digit range. That said, I would expect this to go this way that cost is going to be highest year-over-year in Q1 and then tail off as we march through the year. That's due to two reasons. One, the easing inflationary pressures. But two, you're starting to see improving operating efficiencies from the Vulcan Way of Operations. So you couple that together I think we're starting to catch up on the kind of runaway costs we've seen for a couple of years, and we'll -- I think we'll see improvement as we go through the year."", 'Operator', 'And our next question comes from the line of Kathryn Thompson with Thompson Research Group.', 'Kathryn Ingram Thompson', ""Two parts on the -- just more color on the volume guide bridge and what you're seeing from an end market perspective? I know you've had it in prepared commentary, but maybe a little bit more color just in terms of growth rates by end market. And in previous calls, you were able to give some quantification of what mega projects are of your total expected sales. So just a clarification on the earlier question on pricing. Does the pricing guidance, does that include the thought for midyear price increases? Or is it just carryover from previous pricing actions? Or is it a combination of both?"", 'James Thomas Hill', ""Yes, I'll take the midyear first. While there's not much in there from midyear price increases. Now we will or have announced new year price increases and should start those conversations in April. So I'm not saying there's no -- it's not in the plan, but we will for sure have the conversations, are very little ups in the plan. On volume, as we talked about in November, we're predicting a modest decline in demand for '24. We see strength on the public side and kind of a mixed bag of strengths and weaknesses on the private side and I'll go through those. Highways, steady growth wins race, and we'll continue to see that ramp up, and we feel good about it, lots of funding there and is starting to be put to work. Non-highway infrastructure will see solid growth. In nonres, most sectors, I think, will be challenged, that the be traditional non-res, warehouses, distribution. And as you've talked about, that's partially offset in our footprint with the large industrial projects, and I think we have some 10 of those, and we will talk about that later, but they're meaningful. While single family, what we saw was challenged in '23, it will be a strength for us in '24. It's back into growth mode and recovering rapidly. At the same time, I think multifamily, as everybody knows, will be challenged. So as we said, we call volumes flat to negative 4. Now January, February were as everybody knows, we're both either a freeze out or a wash out or both. So we're seeing a slow start. That being said, it's still January and February. So I think we feel very good about the full year guidance. So probably a modest decline in volumes for '24. That said, we should still see healthy double-digit earnings growth."", 'Mary Andrews Carlisle', ""Yes. Kathryn, I'll give you a couple of other things to think about regarding Q1 volume that may be helpful context. Last February was seasonally adjusted the strongest single months of shipments we had in 2023 and the strongest February in at least the last 10 years. And also this year simply given the way the calendar falls, we'll have approximately 10% fewer shipping days in March, which, clearly, we all know is the most important month of the quarter. Now the good news there is that's just timing. We picked those days back up in April. But from the Q1 perspective, it will be impactful. So overall, volumes will be challenged in the first quarter. Pricing will be strong, and it should fall within our guidance range. And I would expect that paired with the probable volume impacts to cost I'd expect maybe mid- to high single-digit growth in cash gross profit per ton in the first quarter still with the very attractive mid-teens improvement for the full year."", 'Operator', ""And we'll take our next question from the line of Anthony Pettinari with Citi."", 'Anthony James Pettinari', ""I'm wondering if you could talk a little bit more about capital allocation. And we've seen a number of, I guess, very large deals in construction materials over the past few months. Just wondering if you could talk about potential attractiveness of M&A and what the pipeline might look like from your perspective in 2024?"", 'Mary Andrews Carlisle', ""Yes, sure. Anthony, the balance sheet is really well positioned to fund all of our capital allocation priorities in 2024, particularly M&A growth. As we mentioned, we ended the year with over $900 million of cash and net leverage of 1.5x. So we'll think about capital allocation in 2024, very consistently as we have in the past, that there is a very attractive M&A pipeline and that's what we're focused on in terms of being able to deploy the capacity that we have. And I'll let Tom, do you want to make any more comments on the pipeline?"", 'James Thomas Hill', ""Sure. Well, I think -- if I step back and look at it, ours is a 3-pronged strategy to growth, and it's very effective and has provided us with double-digit revenues and EBITDA for the last 3 years and a little again in 2024. And those three are: number one, organic growth in what we're selling, what we're operating, which you see us do. And we've been very consistent. We've been able to grow those unit margins for -- consistently for 5 years. Second, as you talked about is M&A. I think M&A, while it was pretty quiet in '23 with a lot of unknowns out there, I think it will be very busy in 2024. I would expect us to bring some deals to the finish line. And then I would -- supplementing that M&A is greenfield growth, which is -- picking up, and we have a handful of those projects beginning this year and will take a little bit of time to get through that and we get a little closer to it. We'll talk about some of those. But I feel really good about growth strategy and M&A, I think, will be a much bigger part of it in '24 than what we saw in '23."", 'Operator', 'And our next question comes from the line of Jerry Revich with Goldman Sachs.', 'Jerry David Revich', 'Tom, Mary Andrews, I wanted to ask, in the fourth quarter, your margin performance was really outstanding sequentially, a full point ahead of normal seasonality. So it looks like costs are already starting to come down for you folks. Can you just talk about what improved in the quarter? And is there an opportunity if some of those improvements continue for costs to be at the lower end of the growth outlook that you outlined in the prepared remarks, Tom.', 'James Thomas Hill', ""Well, I think what you're seeing is, as I said earlier, two things, you're moderating inflationary pressures or the comparisons get a lot easier. And I think we'll continue to see that. But also if you look at our operating parameters and remember, we put the automation and the insights and the technology in the top 100 plants over last year. You're starting to see those things go to work, which helps us with and throughput of critical sizes. So I think that as we march through 2024, I think our costs should improve sequentially as we go through the quarter. Now weather can have a hiccup on that or one big outages can have a hit on that. But overall, I would expect our costs to continue to improve over the next 4 or 5 quarters."", 'Operator', 'And our next question comes from the line of Phil Ng with Jefferies.', 'Philip H. Ng', ""Congrats on a really strong quarter. So Tom, last year, your pricing philosophy, I think, was to go big to start the year on aggregate pricing and take a more measured approach on mid-years. If I've heard you correctly, you're at least having a conversation on midyear already. So just give a little color on how you're thinking about your approach and velocity this year, and a more moderating inflationary environment, do you think double-digit pricing is kind of the new norm going forward?"", 'James Thomas Hill', ""Well, as I said, I think we're in a very, very good place from a pricing perspective based on the fundamentals that we're seeing and also the Vulcan was selling those tools help us dramatically in bid work. I think that we went early as we have, and I think that will continue in January 1, which helps -- obviously helps. We think we were appropriate in our Jan 1 prices. We've announced midyears in a few markets already. I think over the next -- probably the next beginning end of the quarter, we'll probably announce it midyears for the other markets. And obviously, you spent April, May and June, having those conversations so that you're ready for July/August for a midyear price increase. So I think that what those -- the fact that it's all in January and the fact that everybody expects to have conversations about midyear price increases, I think, is very important for our markets."", 'Philip H. Ng', 'And then double-digit pricing, is that like the new norm going forward?', 'James Thomas Hill', 'I feel good about pricing.', 'Operator', 'Our next question from the line of Michael Feniger with Bank of America.', 'Michael J. Feniger', 'Tom, to follow up on just the pricing. Can you just -- the cadence of pricing for this year? You gave great color on the cadence of how you think cost plays out. Just on pricing, do you think about the end of the year, are you still kind of in that 10% to 12% range? Or are you below it because you start strong? Just kind of how we should think about that?', 'James Thomas Hill', ""No. I think the pricing will be pretty consistent through the year in the 10% to 12% range. I don't see big changes in that. Now you also got to -- in the third quarter, you got to see what happens with midyears. And we'll have that conversation after we get past July 1, to give you a lot more clarity because we'll just have a clear picture of it. And every market is going to be different. They always are. But I would call it, pretty consistent low double-digit pricing throughout the year."", 'Michael J. Feniger', ""Great. And Tom, just to follow up, you gave great color on kind of the volumes, your shipment growth with the different segments. Just when we think of say fast forward to 2025, and obviously, we'll see how 2024 plays out. But if you in a similar range in 2025 with the volume kind of guidance and it's underpinned by growth in infrastructure. Can you just help us understand how that informs pricing relative to maybe if it's being driven by residential or private construction market how having it underpinned by infrastructure, had that kind of maybe shift the pricing conversations."", 'James Thomas Hill', ""I would tell you that my philosophy is all demand growth are good things. I don't care where it comes from, well, I like it. But the pricing between public and private, there's really not a big difference there. The -- I think the one thing I would call out, the good thing about public demand is it's very visible, and it's for sure. I mean on the private side, people can hold projects or delay them. But public growth is going to go to work. It's not a matter of if, it's when. And so that visibility to growing demand on the public side is really good for pricing. But a ton of concrete rock for public or private is probably the same number. The difference is the public, people know it's there. They know it's coming, and they can take risk on value and price."", 'Operator', ""And we'll take our next question from the line of Mike Dahl with RBC Capital Markets."", 'Michael Glaser Dahl', ""Just back on kind of the M&A and capital allocation. You raised some pretty healthy funds from the RMC sale. And Texas, it seems like that was the last big chunk side from maybe California of the legacy U.S. Concrete assets. So I just wanted to have you elaborate a little more on kind of rationale behind making the move now. And then when -- as you think about reallocation, you mentioned M&A, there's organic investments. I mean you obviously now are -- have pretty healthy cap position. So relative -- this was asked before, but ag-specific pipeline and relative size of the deals that you think are potentially out there that can cross the finish line this year? Or anything you can provide there?"", 'James Thomas Hill', ""I would look at the M&A as more traditional bolt-on, I think, which is very much in our footprint, so has highest returns. Deal sizes, everything from small to mid-range, maybe a little better -- somewhat little bigger than mid-range. But I think that as far as the timing is concerned, I think '23 was abnormally -- I guess, quiet, and it was because there was so much insecurity about -- are we going to fall off a cliff? Is there going to be a recession? And so when you have all those unknowns, people tend to slow down both buyers and sellers. And I think that the fact you got that behind you, you'll see some catch-up in 2024."", 'Michael Glaser Dahl', 'And rationale for exiting the ready-mix assets.', 'James Thomas Hill', ""Well, I think if you look at our assets, we look at our business as a collection of assets. And if there were more to someone besides us, and it's not strategic, then there ought to be another owner, and we'll take that money and apply it back in the aggregates business. And so this is no different than what you've seen us do and we exit businesses at times and we exit different product lines at times. And so this will make sense strategically for us to sell the Texas ready-mix business."", 'Operator', ""And we'll take our next question from the line of Keith Hughes with Truist."", 'Keith Brian Hughes', ""Just to shift over to asphalt and concrete, you gave guidance down a good bit in cash. Cash gross profit versus prior year. Can you talk a little bit more in detail what's going on in what you expect in '24."", 'James Thomas Hill', ""Yes. I think the asphalt performance in a 13% gross margin was a really good performance. Now if you look back about 3 years ago, everybody asked me why don't you sell that asphalt business and now everybody wants me to buy more. So that's just the asphalt business. But 13% is a good number. So it's performing well. We see flat at very high levels for 2024. And I would call that hot mix price increases offsetting increasing liquid costs and increasing aggregate costs. So asphalt is in a very good place, and we like our story there, and I think that those teams are performing well. Ready mix, I'd call it, virtually flat with the private side have some challenged markets. That affects the ready-mix business. But it's not a bad performance based on some of the private challenges we had. But remember, ready-mix is 2% of our EBITDA. So I think under the circumstances, both businesses are doing fine."", 'Mary Andrews Carlisle', ""Yes. And just in terms of ready-mix, Keith, just maybe a couple of things helpful to think about the impact of the divestiture. Our expectations in 2024 for a modest decline in same-store volumes, which were about 4 million cubic yards in 2023. And we expect kind of consistent gross margin performance. I think in longer term about that. I think that there are low single -- I mean our low double-digit expectations are still what we're pushing for. That's going to take time and better volumes to get there. But one thing about 2024, where we expect relatively flat gross margins with the weight of the noncash fixed cost on the volume challenges that Tom mentioned, really driven by private non-res. We do expect to see some expansion in cash gross profit margins and also improved unit profitability given the markets where we've retained our concrete businesses."", 'Operator', ""And we'll take our next question from the line of Garik Shmois with Loop Capital."", 'Garik Simha Shmois', ""Congrats on the nice results. I wanted to follow up on the cost side. I know it's a little bit more favorable than the preliminary outlook you offered on the 3Q call and you spoke to some broad-based deflation getting better as you move through the year, operational improvements helping as well. Anything in particular though that's changed or has gotten better since the last call that you could point to on the cost side, that would be helpful."", 'James Thomas Hill', ""Yes. I think what you're seeing there is the Vulcan Way of Operating and efficiencies in those plants. And that's what embedded in that is technology. It is training, which is so important from a safety perspective, but also from a plan of availability and inspection of that equipment. And then you're seeing our throughputs size is starting to improve. So it's a combination of easing inflationary pressures, comps kind of level out, but also those operating efficiencies are really, really important to making sure that we -- our job is to beat inflation, not just live with it."", 'Operator', ""And we'll take our next question from the line of Angel Castillo with Morgan Stanley."", 'Angel Castillo', ""Congrats on the quarter. Mary Andrews I thought I heard you say, I guess, that given the kind of capital that you have, you still have the ability to kind of do organic, inorganic and return capital to shareholders. So I just wanted to expand on that a little bit. It sounds like on the M&A front, you're looking at more bolt-ons. And if I did the math correctly, just moving to the midpoint of your kind of leverage allows you to have at least another kind of $2 billion of, kind of, capital that you can deploy, which seems plenty for both M&A as well as other ways of kind of returning cash to shareholders. So maybe just could you talk about buyback intentions for the year and then also willingness of potentially levering up above your range -- historical range for the right opportunities and returning cash to shareholders?"", 'Mary Andrews Carlisle', ""Yes, sure. As you referenced, I think we're really well positioned to be able to fund all of our capital allocation priorities in 2024. And as it relates to returning cash to shareholders, doing that via repurchases has long been a part of our capital allocation priorities. I think appropriately following -- reinvesting in the business, growing the business through both M&A and greenfield and returning cash through our sustainable dividend. But with the attractive cash generation and you saw with the slower M&A in 2023, we did repurchase $200 million of shares. And we would enter 2024 thinking about making those capital allocation decisions in the same kind of disciplined manner. And in terms of leverage, I think for us, regardless of where we are, in the -- against kind of our target leverage range. What's important is being disciplined about doing the right deals and the deals that are going to have attractive returns for us. And we certainly have over time, levered up even outside the top end of that range with plans to always quickly get back within that 2 to 2.5x that we tend to target."", 'Operator', ""And we'll take our next question from the line of Michael Dudas with Vertical Research."", 'Michael Stephan Dudas', ""Curious about your thoughts. You indicated a positive trend for Civil Public Infrastructure and records stated on the [transportation] budgets. How are -- are they prepared and ready to pull through when you see some of the budget numbers in your important states. I'm also curious on how things in California because you hear certainly, Caltrans is the above budget there, but certainly, there could be some other issues there. So just a little bit of sense on the public side in your important states, how you see the opportunities for bidding and project work going forward."", 'James Thomas Hill', ""Yes. I think they're still challenged, but they are because they got so much money, it's a lot for them to digest, but they are growing into it. And as I've said, we'll see solid growth in highways in '24. We saw low-single digit in '23. We'd expect mid-single digit in '24 kind of as expected. But also, we got to remember that IIJA passed in November of '21. So we're just past that 2-year mark and we say it takes 2 years. As we've said, it will be a ramp-up, not a step change in this. And I think it will be a ramp up over time. And I think that the DOTs are growing into their capital added resources and the lettings continue to be healthy. There's a lot of money out there. But I would -- what I would see here, I think, is kind of slow and steady wins the race, and we'll see improving growth in '24 kind of mid-single digit. I think that will go up in '25 again. I think that demand will go up in '26 and also think it will go up in '27. So that slow and steady improvement in public isn't bad particularly when you're compounding unit margins like we are. As far as Caltrans, I think they'll be fine. There's always some (inaudible) numerous times in Caltrans and funding and people trying to grab it. But remember, it is firewalled. It has to be used for infrastructure."", 'Operator', ""And we'll take our last question from the line of Brent Thielman with D.A. Davidson."", 'Brent Edward Thielman', ""I guess a clarification question on the ready-mix business. The kind of refinement of that time over the last 12 months, can you sort of level set us on what that business is now sized to do? I think you did 7.5 million cubic yards in '23. Where do we go from here? And I guess my other question, and kind of the last is I think we've all been sort of worried about the implications of some of this light nonresidential activity, sort of more interest rate-sensitive sectors hitting your business. Could you talk about to what degree that's actually had an impact? Has it been more resilient than you would have expected?"", 'James Thomas Hill', ""I'll take that one first, and then I'll let Mary Andrews just take the ready-mix. I think it's been fairly weak for us. Obviously, offices has been weak, but last year, the light side was pretty weak. So kind of more same on that, still challenged by interest rates. And my -- I would tell you that my view of that is that the more traditional ex office building, more traditional light nonresidential construction usually follows creation of subdivisions. And so we're back in growth mode in those subdivisions. So I would expect us sometime maybe '25, middle '25, that starts to impact that sector of the light, [resi]. So it probably has a brighter future than what we've seen in '23 and '24. But kind of -- what I got described, '24 is more of the same with '23."", 'Mary Andrews Carlisle', ""Yes. And in terms of ready-mix, we completed the divestiture of the Texas Concrete in mid-November and have disclosed that was about 4 million cubic yards annually. So that puts us in 2023 at about 4 million cubic yards on a same-store basis. We would expect those volumes to decline modestly in our 2024 outlook of those cash gross profit dollars being 30% of that $275 million kind of, as I said, consistent from a gross margin percentage standpoint, with 2023, a bit of expansion from a cash gross profit percentage standpoint. And in that business, we're focused on continuing to improve that margin performance over time for the retained assets that we have, which we believe are in very attractive and well-structured ready-mix markets."", 'Operator', ""And we have no further questions at this time. I'll turn the call back over to Tom for any closing remarks."", 'James Thomas Hill', 'Thank you for your time this morning. We appreciate your interest in Vulcan Materials Company. We look forward to talking to you throughout the quarter. Please keep yourselves and your family safe. Thank you.', 'Operator', ""This concludes today's conference.

GuruFocus has detected 5 Warning Sign with REG.', ""On February 16, 2024, Regency Centers Corp (NASDAQ:REG), a leading retail real estate investment trust (REIT), filed its annual 10-K report, revealing a year of strategic growth and operational resilience. With the completion of the Urstadt Biddle acquisition, REG's portfolio now encompasses 482 properties with a gross leasable area of 56.8 million square feet. This expansion not only diversifies REG's geographic footprint but also enhances its market-leading position in the grocery-anchored shopping center segment. Financially, REG maintains a conservative capital structure, with a focus on liquidity and a disciplined debt maturity profile, which positions the company to navigate economic cycles effectively. The company's commitment to environmental, social, and governance (ESG) practices further underscores its dedication to corporate responsibility and long-term value creation."", ""Market Leadership and Portfolio Quality: Regency Centers Corp's preeminence as a national owner, operator, and developer of neighborhood and community shopping centers is a significant strength. The company's strategic focus on grocery-anchored centers in suburban trade areas with compelling demographics provides a stable revenue base, as these centers tend to be more resilient to economic downturns. With 80% of properties featuring a grocery anchor, REG commands higher rental and occupancy rates, contributing to a robust net operating income (NOI). The quality of REG's shopping centers, coupled with its strategy of maintaining and renovating these centers to high standards, further reinforces its competitive advantage."", ""Financial Discipline and Strong Balance Sheet: REG's conservative capital structure and strong balance sheet are critical strengths that provide financial flexibility and sufficient liquidity to meet capital needs. The company's careful construction of its debt maturity profile allows it to weather economic downturns, and its disciplined development and redevelopment platform enable the creation of exceptional retail centers that deliver favorable returns. This financial prudence is reflected in REG's ability to generate total returns at or near the top of its shopping center peers, thereby creating shareholder value through increasing earnings and dividends per share."", ""Brick-and-Mortar Vulnerability: Despite REG's strategic positioning, the company acknowledges the ongoing competition from alternative shopping and delivery methods, which poses a weakness for the brick-and-mortar retail space. Consumer preferences continue to shift towards e-commerce, and this trend could impact the demand for physical retail space, potentially affecting REG's tenant retention and leasing activity. The company must continuously innovate and adapt to these changing consumer behaviors to maintain its market position."", ""Integration Risks from Acquisitions: The recent Urstadt Biddle acquisition, while strategically beneficial, introduces integration risks that could impact REG's operational efficiency. The complexities of merging two companies with different histories, cultures, and customer bases may lead to integration challenges, including potential lost sales, tenant issues, and increased expenses. Successful integration is crucial for realizing the anticipated benefits and synergies from the merger."", ""Expansion and Redevelopment Potential: REG's acquisition of Urstadt Biddle presents significant opportunities for growth and expansion. By leveraging the combined assets and expertise, REG can enhance its portfolio and explore new market opportunities. Additionally, the company's industry-leading development and redevelopment platform positions it to create high-quality retail centers that can attract top-tier tenants and generate higher returns, contributing to long-term growth."", ""ESG Leadership and Community Engagement: REG's commitment to ESG practices and community engagement offers opportunities to strengthen its brand and foster positive stakeholder relationships. By implementing leading ESG programs and engaging with local communities, REG can enhance its reputation as a responsible and socially conscious company, which can be a differentiator in the market and attract socially responsible investors."", ""Competitive Market Dynamics: The competitive landscape in which REG operates is a significant threat. With numerous companies and individuals engaged in the retail real estate business, REG faces competition for attracting tenants and acquiring new development sites. Additionally, the presence of grocery store chains that own shopping centers and anchor some of REG's properties adds another layer of competition that the company must navigate to maintain its market share."", ""Macroeconomic and Geopolitical Risks: Current geopolitical challenges, such as the war involving Russia and Ukraine and potential conflicts involving China, could impact the U.S. economy and consumer spending. These macroeconomic uncertainties may lead to rising inflation and interest rates, labor shortages, and supply chain constraints, which could adversely affect REG's tenants' businesses and, consequently, REG's financial performance. The company must remain vigilant and adaptable to these external risks to mitigate their impact on its operations."", 'In conclusion, Regency Centers Corp (NASDAQ:REG) exhibits a strong foundation with its market leadership, high-quality portfolio, and financial discipline. However, it must navigate the challenges of a shifting retail landscape and the integration of its recent acquisition. Opportunities for growth through redevelopment and a focus on ESG initiatives present avenues for differentiation and value creation. Nonetheless, REG must remain strategic in the face of competitive pressures and macroeconomic uncertainties that threaten the retail real estate sector. By leveraging its strengths and addressing its weaknesses, while capitalizing on opportunities and mitigating threats, REG is poised to maintain its position as a leading retail REIT.', 'This article, generated by GuruFocus, is designed to provide general insights and is not tailored financial advice.

As a reminder, this call is being recorded and is also being webcast with an accompanying slide presentation through the company's Investor Relations website. The audio webcast archive will be available for one year on American Water's Investor Relations website. I'd now like to introduce you to your host for today's call, Aaron Musgrave, Vice President of Investor Relations. Mr. Musgrave, you may begin."", ""Aaron Musgrave: Thank you, Dave. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us for today's call. At the end of our prepared remarks, we will open the call for your questions. Let me first go over some safe harbor language. Today, we will be making forward-looking statements that represent our expectations regarding our future performance or other future events. These statements are predictions based on our current expectations, estimates and assumptions. However, since these statements deal with future events, they are subject to numerous known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors that may cause actual results to be materially different from the results indicated or implied by such statements. Additional information regarding these risks, uncertainties and factors as well as a more detailed analysis of our financials and other important information is provided in the fourth quarter earnings release and in our 2023 Form 10-K, each filed yesterday with the SEC.."", ""And finally, all statements during this presentation related to earnings and earnings per share refer to diluted earnings and diluted earnings per share. After our prepared remarks, we'll then close by answering your questions. With that, I'll turn the call over to American Waters' President and CEO, Susan Hardwick."", ""Susan Hardwick: Thanks, Aaron. Good morning, everyone. As we announced yesterday, we finished 2023 with very strong financial results that were right on plan. As shown on slide five, earnings were $4.90 per share for the year, which included $0.13 per share of favorable weather, most of which we discussed earlier in the year. Excluding the estimated weather impact, earnings of $4.77 per share were at the midpoint of the guidance rates we shared originally back in November of 2022. I'm very proud of our company's ability to stay focused on serving our customers safely and reliably through numerous economic events this past year, which gave us the ability to confidently execute on the plan we had for 2023. I'm also proud of the resilient service we consistently deliver, and especially over the past few months during a cold January and active storm season across the country."", ""I want to thank our employees for safely providing reliable service to the 14 million people we serve in their homes, businesses, and communities. You can see here on slide five an abbreviated list of some of our key accomplishments in 2023, and John and Cheryl will add to these in their remarks. Overall, we believe the takeaway today for investors is that our strong execution in 2023 amid the challenging macro backdrop coupled with our clear top-tier growth plan demonstrates American Water's ability to deliver on our long-term plan. I'm very confident we will execute our plans in 2024 and beyond with the great momentum we have from 2023. Turning to slide six. As you can see, we have delivered an excellent total shareholder return over the past five and ten years, including our growing record of significant dividend increases."", ""We're proud of this history, which compares very favorably to other utilities. I want to acknowledge, though, that our stock and utility stocks in general did not perform nearly as well as the S&P 500 in 2023, which dampened the outperformance we've had versus the S&P 500 over the last decade or so. Relative valuations of utility stocks fell without regard to specific performance, all of that while we continued our very strong performance. I'm confident our company's fundamentals and the execution of our strategies will continue to produce superior shareholder value and very competitive total shareholder returns for years to come, which takes us to slide seven. The comments that we'll share today are largely an affirmation of the financial plan, long-term targets, and guidance we laid out last November, highlighted by 7% to 9% EPS and dividend growth."", ""Later, John will recap the drivers for our growth in 2024, including the increase to our EPS guidance range that we announced yesterday. Big picture, though, we believe the combination of our EPS and dividend growth, our low-risk capital plan, our ESG leadership, and the affordability of our service continues to be rewarded by investors and distinguishes us from other utilities in the sector. I'll remind you that we believe the runway for our growth and for achieving these targets is very long, certainly through 2028 in our five-year plan and beyond that. This, of course, is driven by significant investments in infrastructure and acquisitions coupled with our track record of constructive regulatory outcomes, all with a keen focus on affordability."", ""And on top of all of that, we continue to grow organically, including in our military services business that successfully serves 18 military installations across the country. One final thought I want to leave you with as we begin 2024. American Water continues to receive tremendous support at the state and federal level for the work we do across the country. The impact we are making in communities across our 14 states to improve water and wastewater service is critical to the well-being of the citizens we are proud to serve. And as we've told you many times, we are committed to solving local infrastructure issues while at the same time driving efficiencies in our business to remain very affordable to our customers. Policymakers frequently encourage our leadership to keep growing, keep investing, and keep solving problems in their states."", ""And this includes Pennsylvania, where we applaud the Public Utility Commission's proposal on February 1 to enhance the process around the implementation of fair market value legislation. We believe the spirit of the enhancements is to increase public awareness and establish greater procedural consistency, all in support of much-needed consolidation of the common wealth water and wastewater systems. While the business of providing these critical services can at times lead to enhancements in the way we do business, including in the regulatory construct, we have no doubt about the overwhelmingly positive support we receive from stakeholders as we pursue our company's mission. With that, I'll turn it over to Cheryl to talk more about rate-based growth, our regulatory plan, and some recent news around lead service lines."", 'Cheryl?', ""Cheryl Norton: Thanks, Susan and good morning, everyone. Let me start by turning to slide 9, where these graphs illustrate that our continued successful execution of our capital investment plan is succeeding in growing regulated rate base consistent with our long-term rate of 8% to 9%. Rate-based growth, of course, will drive earnings growth. We believe the high degree of visibility to our capital investment plan, combined with the low-risk nature of the plan, uniquely positions American Water in the utility sector and is fundamental to our investment thesis. Turning to slide 10, I'll cover the latest regulatory activity in our states, beginning with our most recently filed cases. In Pennsylvania, we filed a general rate case in November and are seeking recovery of $1 billion of investments."", 'The case is proceeding as planned, including testimony and evidentiary hearings that are scheduled for February and March, with rates still expected to be effective in August. As a reminder, Pennsylvania uses a forward test year for rate-making purposes. In New Jersey, we filed a general rate case in January and are seeking recovery of over $1.3 billion of investments through December 2024. This case includes, for example, infrastructure improvement projects at all seven of our surface water treatment plants in the state. We expect the New Jersey case to be completed sometime later this fall. We also filed a general rate case last month in Illinois, where we have invested over $550 million since our last case. Our general rate cases in California, West Virginia, and Virginia are all progressing well and as expected.', ""In California, we reached a partial settlement in the case in November related to the revenue request. We will prepare to implement the new rates retroactively to January 1, 2024, upon receiving the CPUC's decision on the settlement agreement and outstanding topics related to rate design and revenue stabilization mechanisms. Our request for a one-year extension on the cost of capital was also granted, pushing the next filing out to May of 2025. In Indiana, we received a final order just yesterday, and it looks very constructive. We are currently evaluating it and will share key takeaways in the next day or two, but overall, we're generally pleased. Finally, in Kentucky, we expect to receive a final order very soon. As a reminder, we expect to file general rate cases about every two years in our larger jurisdictions."", ""Because we make prudent investments and have skilled and dedicated employees working on these cases, we're very confident in obtaining constructive outcomes again in 2024, as we did in 2023. On the legislative front, in New Jersey, new legislation supporting capital investment was passed and was signed by the governor in January. The Resiliency and Environmental System Investment Sharge, or RESIC for short, establishes a new regulatory mechanism that will enable water and wastewater utilities to recover in a more timely manner capital spending related to investments in resiliency, environmental compliance, safety, and public health. This includes capital related to PFAS remediation. In fact, most of our states where PFAS is present, there are either existing environmental mechanisms that we believe PFAS investments will fit under, or we're proactively advocating for such mechanisms."", ""To show the magnitude of our regulatory execution efforts, you can see on slide 11 that we have $390 million in annualized new revenues and rates since January of 2023. This includes $273 million from general rate cases and step increases and $117 million from infrastructure surSharges. We also have $670 million of total annualized revenue requests pending. As a reminder, American Water recovers about 75% of our overall capital spend through infrastructure mechanisms or forward test years, which greatly reduces regulatory lag. Alongside all of the investments we're making, we remain extremely focused on customer affordability and operating efficiently. We are continuing to evolve our strategies around rate design and programs to assist our customers who are challenged with affordability."", ""We are also continuing our focus on technology, efficiencies of scale, and cost management to deliver on customer affordability, especially as the regulatory demands of the proposed PFAS rule and lead and copper rule improvements drive increases on our capital program. On slide 12, I'd like to cover our recent announcements regarding the US EPA's proposed lead and copper rule improvements. Like PFAS, we think clear rules are important and should be enforced for all providers. American Water consistently meets water quality standards related to the lead and copper rules across our footprint and believes removing the risk of lead service lines over time is the right thing to do for the health and safety of our customers. But also like PFAS, we believe all stakeholders must understand the costs associated with the proposed improvements to the lead and copper rule and that the EPA estimates are likely understated."", ""The cost to identify the material of all unknown service lines and replace all lead service lines, including the customer-owned lines and galvanized lines were needed by 2037 will require significant investment for all water systems. We are currently developing preliminary estimates based on the proposed rule. Unlike PFAS, though, the expected timeline for complying with the lead and copper rule improvements is much longer, so the impact on capital spend will be more gradual. Providing safe, reliable, and affordable water is American Water's business. We continue to work with the EPA, Congress, regulators, and policymakers to ensure that the implementation of any final standards protect customers, communities, and the general public. As I close on slide 13, you can see that our five-year capital plan, which is unchanged from November, has $1 billion for PFAS and approximately $500 million for lead service line replacements."", ""We have been proactively investing about $100 million per year to replace lead service lines for several years now and expect to continue that level at least through 2030 or beyond. Depending on the EPA's requirements in the final lead and copper rule improvements, such as for customer-owned service lines, our annual investment level may need to be revised and likely over a longer period of time. Also, we are still awaiting a final rule from the U.S. EPA on PFAS. We continue to expect that there will be no material changes to the proposed rule, and we have not changed any of our announced plans or estimates from last November related to PFAS compliance. We continue to treat for PFAS in compliance with state regulations, and we continue to prepare for full compliance with the new federal rule once released."", 'Previously, we have disclosed that we are a party to the multi-district litigation, or MDL, lawsuit in U.S. District Court for the District of South Carolina against manufacturers of certain PFAS, like 3M and DuPont, for damages. In early December, there were deadlines to decide whether or not to remain partly to the two potential settlements with manufacturers, and we did remain a party to both settlements. We believe this is the optimal path to recouping the most dollars possible from PFAS manufacturers in an expedient manner for our customers. On February 8, the MDL Court issued its final approval of the DuPont settlement. We will now begin the process of perfecting our claims under the settlement within the time period provided by the MDL.', ""A fairness hearing on the 3M settlement was held on February 2. This matter remains pending. In closing, it's important for investors to understand that the ever-changing regulatory environment is leading to significant industry challenges, including those related to lead and PFAS, but also with issues like cyber-security, for example. Each change on its own is significant, but the layering effect of all these changes is even more dramatic. The expertise we bring to the table to solve these challenges is well recognized across the states where we operate and sets us apart from others. It's a privilege and a great responsibility to deliver safe, clean, reliable, and affordable services to our customers and communities. With that, I'll hand it over to John to cover our financial results and plans in further detail."", 'John?', ""John Griffith: Thank you, Cheryl, and good morning, everyone. Turning to slide 15, let me provide a few more details on financial results for 2023. The appendix also has details of fourth quarter EPS. Consolidated earnings were $4.90 per share in 2023, up $0.39 per share compared to 2022, and up $0.32 per share on a weather-normalized basis. Increased revenues were driven by general rate cases we completed in late 2022 and early 2023 in our larger states. These additional revenues are driven by the significant investments we've made and continue to make in our systems. As noted, earnings were higher in 2023 by an estimated net $0.13 per share as a result of weather in the second, third, and fourth quarters due to warm and dry conditions primarily in Missouri, New Jersey, and Pennsylvania."", 'This compares to net favorable weather in the third quarter of 2022 of $0.06 per share, which related mostly to warm and dry conditions in New Jersey. In looking at operating costs, higher pension expense of about $0.13 per share and increased chemical costs of about $0.11 per share, including inflationary pressures, are being recovered in large part through higher revenues we proactively sought in general rate cases we completed in the last 12 months to 18 months. In the fourth quarter, we also had higher costs of about $0.10 per share related to waste disposal, equipment repairs, tank painting, and other maintenance costs across our footprint. Supporting our investment growth, depreciation expense increased $0.24 per share, and the cost of additional long-term financing increased $0.38 per share, primarily related to share count dilution.', ""As I have mentioned all year, the EPS impact of the higher share count from our equity issuance back in early March was offset by avoided interest on the year. An additional benefit realized this year from the equity issuance is the interest income we have been earning from the cash balance held since March. Other reflects primarily post-closing acquisition adjustments in 2022 from the sales of HOS in New York, which added to EPS. Turning to slide 16, you will see we continue to be set up for strong growth through acquisitions. We closed on '23 acquisitions totaling $77 million across eight states in 2023. We also have 25 transactions under agreement across seven states at year end, totaling $589 million and 88,000 customer connections. This total includes both the Butler Area Sewer Authority wastewater system in Pennsylvania and the Granite City wastewater treatment plant in Illinois."", 'We are very close to completing the Granite City acquisition where we already provide wastewater collection service for approximately 12,000 customers. In Pennsylvania, as Susan briefly discussed, the regulatory environment relating to acquisitions is undergoing change, which we think is ultimately necessary and positive, but will take a period of time to sort out. We are very confident that Act 12 fair market value legislation will remain in place and continue to have strong support. As is often the case, implementation of legislation needs to be worked through in the regulatory arena, and that is what is happening now. In the meantime, closing of our current pending transactions will likely take more time than usual, but to be clear, we are confident that the previously approved Butler acquisition will close soon.', 'We are continuing to invest in regulated acquisition opportunities in Pennsylvania, driven by the continued need for system consolidation and upgrading for the benefit of communities in Pennsylvania who deserve safe and reliable water and wastewater service. As you know, we have a strong track record of closing acquisitions. Over the past five years, we have closed over 100 acquisitions across 12 states, totaling nearly 200,000 new customer connections. Of course, as we close transactions, the work to build and refill our acquisition pipeline is continuous. Our pipeline of more than 1.3 million customer connections with meaningful contributions from across our platform continues to be a strong leading indicator that supports this piece of our rate-based growth outlook.', 'As you recall, in November, we introduced our long-term target of 2% annual customer growth from acquisitions, as shown on slide 7. This equates to about 70,000 acquired customers per year, based on our current customer count of approximately 3.5 million customers. We are proactively investing in our capabilities across our platform to bolster our system-wide contribution to acquisitions to support this growth and are confident in meeting our 2% long-term target. Turning to slide 17, here we show the buildup from 2023 weather-normalized actual to the 2024 EPS guidance range of $5.10 to $5.20 that we introduced last November, which reflects 8% growth at the midpoint of $5.15. Working from that same buildup, yesterday, we announced an increase of $0.10 per share to our 2024 EPS guidance range, which is now $5.20 to $5.30 per share.', ""The increase is due solely to additional interest income we will receive in 2024 and expect to receive annually through 2026 from the amended terms of the secured seller note from the sale of HOS. As we described in the 8-K we filed on February 5, the note balance has been increased to $795 million from $720 million, which satisfies payment of a contingent consideration owed to American Water of $75 million, triggered by the extension of HOS's service agreement with the New York City Water Board. In addition, reflecting current market interest rates and removal of American Water's option to require prepayment of the note at a future date, the annual interest rate on the note has been increased from 7% to 10%. American Water is pleased to see the continued growth of the HOS business under its new ownership, including the service contract extension with New York City, as well as the significant acquisition recently announced by HOS, which will be funded with new equity from HOS's owners."", ""As it relates to future earnings guidance, it will be important for investors to be able to track the ongoing growth of American Water from its core regulated strategy before this additional interest income. Therefore, when we provide forward year EPS guidance each November, we will be sure to note the EPS associated with the additional interest income from the secured seller note in that guidance. To wrap up, slide 18 is a summary of our continued strong financial condition, which we further solidified in 2023. Just last month, Moody's affirmed our solid Baa1 investment grade credit rating and stable outlook and noted our improved FFO to debt ratio. We are confident our FFO to debt ratios will continue to support our current credit ratings."", ""Our total debt to capital ratio as of December 31, net of our roughly $330 million of cash on hand is 55%, which is comfortably within our long-term target of less than 60%. While having moderated somewhat, the current higher interest rate environment continues to be challenging. As I said in November, though, we are in a position of strength on a number of fronts in dealing with this challenge. Our strategy of issuing debt at the holding company level allows us to take advantage of our scale and pricing debt issuances, and we will remain proactive in managing risk and achieving a low cost of capital to the benefit of our customers and shareholders. With that, I'll turn it back over to our operator to begin Q&A and take any questions you may have."", 'Operator: We will now begin the question-and-answer session.

For reference, the healthcare segment is the only one of its four segments to report growth in 2023, and it's set to be spun off in the first half."", ""In addition, 3M's funding requirements for high-profile legal settlements are not precise yet, and there are question marks around its business model and operational execution, not to mention management's track record of meeting its guidance."", ""With all the issues around 3M, industrial bulls might prefer looking at a stock like metalworking and maintenance, repair, and operations (MRO) distributor MSC Industrial. As previously discussed, MSC starts 2024 with weak end markets, but those are nothing that won't be rectified by a lower interest rate environment, possibly beginning in the second half. Relatively high-interest rates are pressuring cyclical sectors such as manufacturing, and suppliers like MSC feel that."", 'Outside of the cyclical factors, MSC is making good progress on strategic initiatives like growing its installed base of vending machines (up 10% year over year). Sales through vending machines now comprise 17% of total sales. In-Plant sales (program count up 35% year over year and sales up 10%).', 'When the manufacturing sector returns to growth, MSC will be ideally placed to benefit. If a renaissance in U.S. manufacturing comes to fruition, led by reshoring as companies seek to simplify overtly complex supply chains, then MSC is one of the best ways to invest in it.', ""The price of copper will inevitably oscillate with demand trends and near-term sentiment over global growth prospects. After all, the industrial metal is the most sensitive commodity to economic growth. There's a case for buying the copper miner's stock as a play on a pick-up in growth later in the year."", 'That said, there are better\xa0arguments about why Freeport is attractive. Copper is an essential metal in the electrification-of-everything trend, encompassing the growth of electric vehicles, renewable energy, data centers, industrial automation, intelligent buildings/infrastructure, and wireless technology. Not only do all of these technologies need more copper, but they imply significantly more investment in transmission and distribution networks, which means more copper.', 'Freeport stands well placed, with a significant ""brownfield growth pipeline"" of projects it can invest in to increase supply, alongside a cost-effective leaching initiative to extract more copper from its mine waste material. It all adds up to make Freeport the best mining stock to buy for 2024.', ""The specialty-alloy company is attractive for three main reasons. First, and keeping with the article's theme, Carpenter has cyclical exposure to the economy through its industrial and consumer, transportation, and energy sales (together making up 31% of its 2023 sales)."", ""Second, its key end markets -- aerospace (50%) and medical (18%) -- are highly attractive. The commercial aerospace market continues to recover strongly, with aerospace giants like General Electric and RTX forecasting another excellent year of growth in the commercial aerospace original-equipment market. Carpenter's medical sales also look set for long-term growth as its specialty alloys go into body implants, the demand for which will only increase due to an aging population and new medical procedures."", ""Third, the company's profit margins and cash-flow generation tend to be leveraged to revenue growth, and both are set to expand significantly in the coming years."", ""Carpenter trades on just 13.3 times estimated earnings for its financial 2025 (which finishes at the end of June 2025).

Our adjusted earnings of $2.88, which excludes temperature impacts and non-GAAP adjustments, continued to deliver on our 5% to 7% long-term growth expectations. We take exceptional pride in delivering on our purpose to serve customers and build stronger communities and consistently achieving our earnings growth objectives.As we look back at 2023, I'm proud we can say, once again, we achieved EPS growth of at least 5%, our 14th straight year of delivering on that objective. We increased our dividend with 2023 marking the 20th straight year of dividend increases. We successfully executed on one of the largest capital expenditure programs in our history. And as of the end of 2023, nearly 30% of our electric distribution system is underground, improving reliability and reducing operating expenses.I will now highlight a few of our many 2023 accomplishments and then turn it over to Lisa and Robert to provide details on our 2023 regulatory operating and financial results. Throughout 2023, our team demonstrated their dedication and resilience as we faced a dynamic economic environment and weather-related challenges, while also successfully advancing our customer-focused investments. We made notable progress on our generation investments. An example is the progress we made in Wisconsin on our utility scale solar projects. As of today, over 90% of our solar investments are complete and in operation, and we expect to be 100% complete later this spring. These strategic investments enhance customer value by providing access to zero cost fuel resources and diversify our energy mix. Also supports our local economies through new jobs and tax revenues. In addition, our wind and solar investments generate renewable tax credits that provide even more benefits to our customers. In 2023, we executed agreements to transfer those credits, improving our cash flow and providing us greater flexibility in our financing plans.Our technology investments and undergrounding efforts place Alliant Energy among the top performers for electric reliability when compared to peer U.S. utilities. Through these investments, we are better positioned to provide our customers with the high level of reliability they expect.Reflecting on the past year and with my tenure as CEO concluding as of year-end 2023, I wish to express my profound pride in all our employees who consistently embody our purpose and values. Each and every day, our employees bring our purpose-driven strategy to life, serving our customers and helping to build stronger communities. I am proud to acknowledge the outstanding contributions of our engineers whose work to innovate and advance our industry will be celebrated next week during National Engineers Week. I'd like to thank our customer service team for consistently going above and beyond as they assist our customers and a sincere thank you to our dedicated crews and support staff for their unwavering commitment to excellence and for being the driving force behind our operating success.In closing, I'd like to extend one more congratulations to Lisa. Her thoughtful leadership, care for the customer and industry knowledge will guide Alliant Energy into the next phase of its journey. I look forward to collaborating with her and the team for continued success in 2024.Now I'll hand the call over to Lisa."", 'Lisa M. Barton', ""Thank you, John. I'm honored for the opportunity to build on your legacy of growth and exceptional service to the communities we are so privileged to serve. As I reflect on 2023, I am appreciative of our employees for their ongoing determination and commitment to serving our customers and strengthening our communities. I'll begin by building on John's comments about our notable progress on our generation transformation in Wisconsin, where we recently brought eight solar projects online, a huge milestone.We are currently leveraging the sun in Wisconsin to fuel nearly 900 megawatts for customers. This will increase to nearly 1.1 gigawatts this spring when our final Wisconsin solar project becomes operational. Coupled with our plans to bring 400 megawatts of solar online in Iowa this year, by year-end, nearly 1,500 of additional megawatts of the energy our customers use will be from clean, zero fuel cost energy resource.In addition to our utility scale solar investments, we continue to partner with local businesses and communities interested in hosting solar projects. our customer-hosted projects help local businesses achieve their clean energy goals while community solar projects provide all customers with affordable options to participate in the solar revolution. In Cedar Rapids, our Community solar garden is fully operational and will soon be generating bill credits for all solar block purchasers. Our Janesville Solar Garden in Wisconsin now has an anchor tenant JP Cullen, and construction is set to begin this spring. We have additional customer hosted projects underway and expect they'll be operational before summer.We made great progress in our clean energy transformation in 2023. We retired the last coal unit at Lansing, which had dutifully served our customers and communities for nearly 50 years. The retirement reduces O&M costs and advances us towards a cleaner, more efficient and cost-effective energy mix. At the same time, we continue to see the frequency and duration of outages in our service footprint steadily declined, a 20-year trend that we expect will continue as we continue focusing on improving reliability and system resilience to meet the expectations of the customers we serve.We began the process to repower the Franklin County Wind project in Iowa to increase the efficiency of our fleet. This investment will provide our customers with many more years of production tax credits. On the environmental front, we completed closure work at 29 surface impoundments across 10 sites, eliminating all Alliant Energy [ash funds] in Iowa and Wisconsin. With these 2023 accomplishments, coupled with our planned investments in dispatchable gas generation, battery storage and wind repowering, we are well on our way of enabling a successful and responsible clean energy transition while assuring we are addressing our system resiliency needs.Looking forward, we continue to plan for the future by evolving and refining our clean energy blueprint, taking into account dynamic economic developments, evolving energy technologies and the emerging needs of the communities we serve. It is a necessary step as we look to balance our energy mix create greater grid reliability, ensure customer affordability and address MISO's resource adequacy needs. 2023 was a record year for us for economic development activities with more than 130 megawatts of announced new load across our footprint, primarily in the manufacturing sector. With a capital investment of approximately $3.8 billion, these projects are expected to create more than 4,000 new local jobs. Going forward, we will continue to pursue opportunities for new customer growth at our industrial parks as we strive to build and support stronger communities.Our strong customer and community focus were contributing factors in recently being named a top utility by Business Facilities Magazine for the fourth year in a row. Alliance Energy received a number of recognitions this past year, a few of them, including ones that focus on our employees' dedication to creating a welcoming and inclusive workplace are highlighted on Slide 5.Earlier this week, we announced the retirement of Terry Kouba, President of IPL. In early March, Terry will be celebrating his 43rd year with the company and has been a thoughtful, respected and customer-focused leader of our Iowa operations. We are grateful for his service and dedication to Alliant Energy, our customers, communities and employees. As we celebrate Terry's well-deserved retirement, we are advancing our succession plan by appointing May Farlinger to the position of President of IPL effective May 1. May have spent her career at Alliant Energy serving in several leadership roles. We are confident in her ability to lead our dedicated team of professionals in Iowa.As we move forward in 2024, I have every confidence we will continue to take the required actions to meet our customer needs and deliver on investor expectations. We are well positioned to quickly adapt to a dynamic environment as we execute our strategy for generating clean, reliable and affordable energy. At this time, I'll turn the call over to Robert."", 'Robert J. Durian', ""Thanks, Lisa. Good morning, everyone. Yesterday, we announced 2023 adjusted earnings of $2.88 per share compared to adjusted earnings of $2.73 per share in 2022. This represents a 5.5% increase in earnings, consistent with our long-term earnings growth target of 5% to 7%. Adjusted earnings exclude the impacts of both nonrecurring adjustments and temperatures. As a reminder, we do not manage our business to offset the temporary positive or negative impacts of temperatures on sales. We manage the business to deliver long-term consistency and enable operational efficiency.Adjusted earnings year-over-year increase was primarily due to higher revenue requirements and AFUDC from capital investments, including the progress by our teams on our solar projects in Wisconsin and Iowa and lower operating and maintenance expenses at IPL and WPL resulting from our employees' focus on cost controls. These positive drivers were partially offset by higher financing and depreciation expenses associated with our customer-focused capital expenditure programs. The 2023 results we are sharing today are a result of our consistent efforts to manage through and mitigate ongoing inflationary pressures. We're extremely proud that our 2023 O&M expenses were approximately $30 million less than 2022, allowing us to help offset the negative impacts on earnings from rising financing and depreciation expenses.Year-over-year sales changes in 2023 were largely impacted by temperature changes. Net temperature impacts decreased Alliant Energy's earnings by approximately $0.06 per share in 2023. In comparison, net temperatures increased Alliant Energy earnings in 2022 by $0.07 per share. Temperature normalized electric sales to our retail customers were relatively flat in 2023 when compared to 2022. We experienced growth in a number of residential customers as well as higher sales from plant expansions in Wisconsin. However, these positive drivers were offset by lower electric sales to industrial customers in Iowa due to plant closures and maintenance outages.Turning to cash flows. 2023 cash flows from operations increased by almost $400 million when compared to 2022. This substantial increase was primarily due to the timing of WPL's fuel-related cost recoveries and monetization of approximately $100 million of tax credits in December. This increase resulted in a material increase in our key cash flow metrics in 2023. I'm also pleased to report that our investing cash flows in 2023, aligned with our projected capital expenditures set at the beginning of the year, due to the successful execution of our key construction projects.Turning to 2024, we are positioned for another year of consistent 5% to 7% growth in adjusted earnings per share. We are affirming our 2024 earnings guidance range of $2.99 to $3.13 per share. Our efforts to support customer value by making smart investments in our future and controlling operating costs, while receiving constructive regulatory outcomes support our ability to consistently deliver solid financial results.Our financing plans for 2024 include $1.7 billion of new debt, largely to finance our investments in renewable and battery projects and support refinancing $800 million in debt maturities this year. We also expect to raise approximately $25 million in new common equity under our DRIP plan and received approximately $120 million from the sales of partial interest in West Riverside. In addition, we expect to generate and transfer more than $200 million of renewable tax credits in 2024 to reduce financing needs.With the implementation of our new solar projects and the repowering of our older, vintage wind facilities, we anticipate the increased production tax credits and reduced fuel costs will help offset the impact of additional renewable rate base, rendering these new investments, cost-effective solutions for our customers. This will result in long-term benefits for our customers and long-term value for our shareowners.Our customers experience the benefits of a diverse generation portfolio in 2023 as the average retail electric rates declined for our Iowa customers due to lower fuel costs. And in Wisconsin, we ended the year in an over-collected position for fuel costs when compared to the 2023 monitoring level. As a result, we plan to refund $34 million back to our Wisconsin retail electric customers in the future.We are also continuing to be well positioned to capture additional benefits for our customers from the Inflation Reduction Act and other government programs. These additional benefits include applying for lower-cost federal funding and infrastructure grants, including a grant from the DOE for long-duration energy storage in Wisconsin. We are also maximizing tax benefits by meeting tax credit added requirements and continuing the monetization of tax credits, which materially improves our cash flow and credit metrics as well as reduces our future financing needs.Finally, I will highlight our regulatory initiatives in progress as well as those regulatory filings we plan to initiate in 2024. We filed rate reviews in both states in 2023 and received a written order in December for the Wisconsin rate review with new rates effective January 1 of this year. And in Iowa, our electric and gas rate review is proceeding as expected with the decision anticipated in the third quarter of this year. The IUB recently finalized the procedural schedule is included on Slide 11.We have two additional pending proceedings in Wisconsin. First, we requested authority to increase the efficiency, capacity and reliability of our Neenah and Sheboygan Falls gas generating units. And second, we filed a joint application to sell an additional 125 megawatts of the West Riverside facility to WEC Energy and Madison Gas and Electric. We are anticipating decisions from the PSCW on both of these applications by the end of the second quarter.Turning to our planned regulatory filings in 2024. We expect to make regulatory filings in both Iowa and Wisconsin for additional renewables and dispatchable resources following our routine, continuous modeling updates of our Clean Energy Blueprint. We expect these projects will enhance reliability, further diversify our energy resources and meet customer energy needs. We very much appreciate the continued support of our company and look forward to meeting with many of you in the coming months.At this time, I'll turn the call back over to the operator to facilitate the question-and-answer session."", 'Operator', '(Operator Instructions) Your first question would be from Shahriar Pourreza at Guggenheim Partners.', 'Shahriar Pourreza', ""Now that we've got a schedule, obviously, it was in the prepared remarks, right, the schedule for Iowa. Can you just maybe speak to the prospects for a settlement, when would that window be for that to occur?"", 'Lisa M. Barton', ""Sure. So I mean, we're feeling very good about where we are with respect to IPL. Everything is going as expected, the schedule on track. If you're looking at a settlement window, it's really any time after the intervenor testimony is submitted through that June 18 deadline."", 'Shahriar Pourreza', ""And Lisa, there was a report from the IUB to the legislator last December, kind of discussing ratemaking reforms, PBRs, multiyear plans and other sort of potential policy updates. Is that a process you're involved in sort of at this point? And could we see something come out of the session?"", 'Lisa M. Barton', ""So those recommendations actually have been out for the legislature to consider. As we look at our legislative priorities this year, the mega site development to support economic development is top of mind for us, advancing the advanced ratemaking for alternative technologies. One of the elements that has been brought up in the legislature is asking for a contested IRP and that is something that we are not supportive of. We have been very transparent in our resource plans. We're pro planning, we're pro transparency. But in terms of a contested proceeding, that's just something that is not really consistent with the evolving generation landscape that we're finding ourselves in."", 'Operator', 'Next question is from Nicholas Campanella at Barclays.', 'Nicholas Joseph Campanella', ""I guess just on -- you previewed some kind of tax credit monetization already. You have $200 million in the plan for '24. Just -- Is it still the case that you kind of expect $300 million a year plus in '25 and beyond? Or can you just help us kind of think about what the tax credit transferability benefit is in the out years?"", 'Robert J. Durian', ""Yes, sure, Nick. So we've been very successful at the execution of bilateral agreements with the first round of tax credits we sold here in 2023. As we think about the future and we think about all the different opportunities we have to sell renewable tax credits, we do think we'll get up above $300 million once we get out to that 2025 time frame. When you think about the volume of wind production that we have right now, combined with the 1,500 megawatts of solar that Lisa referenced, the 275 megawatts of battery projects that we've received approval from the PSCW to implement in Wisconsin and the fact that we're going to repower several of our older vintage wind projects, the volume of tax credits, like I said, we'll get above that $300 million level starting in 2025 and continue for several years into the future."", 'Nicholas Joseph Campanella', 'And then just on your comments on Wisconsin filing cadence. I think you kind of mentioned that you have new renewables coming into the picture that you had to file for. But is that just like a follow-on limited reopener type filing from the prior rate case? Or this is not like a full rate case here to contemplate right now. Can you just kind of maybe update us on your overall strategy there?', 'Lisa M. Barton', ""I think what you're referring to are the updates on our Clean Energy Blueprint. That is something that we're doing in both Iowa and Wisconsin this year. The work that we're doing there will really identify the projects needed to meet our future resource needs and reflecting changes that are there from the MISO rule contracts. So any CapEx associated with that would be in the fall."", 'Nicholas Joseph Campanella', ""Got it. Yes. That's -- and that CapEx is not in the plan now and is more of a fall update to your point. Okay."", 'Lisa M. Barton', 'Correct.', 'Operator', 'Next question will be from Julien Dumoulin-Smith at Bank of America.', 'Julien Patrick Dumoulin-Smith', ""And just with respect, maybe looking to pick it up where Nick left it off because I think that's a nice point on just talking through the updated Clean Energy Blueprint. Is this an appropriate route to talk about just the demand from customers and talk about what we've seen from some of your peers with respect to demand growth? I get that this is a little bit adjacent in terms of modeling and sort of, as you say, continuous routine modeling. But we've seen some of these out-of-cycle updates pop up in some of these more mundane integrated resource filings elsewhere. Just curious on how you would set up expectations here in both the jurisdictions."", 'Lisa M. Barton', ""Yes, that's a great question, Julien. We are certainly focused on economic development. That's something we're doubling down on. In terms of putting that into our forecast and into our resource plans. We need to have a level of confidence that they'll be there. So just stay tuned with respect to that space. And as I mentioned earlier, later in '24, we will be updating our resource planning needs over the future, where we have factored in load growth and factored in the implications of the MISO rules that are constantly evolving."", 'Julien Patrick Dumoulin-Smith', ""Actually, since you bring it up, let me jump to this question. I think MISO has an update on MTEP coming up ahead as well. I know they do this on the regular, but I think there's another more meaningful update on the come here. Would that conceivably align with the timeline that you're talking about?"", 'Lisa M. Barton', ""Well, we constantly watch MISO's work with respect to tranche 1 and tranche 2. Tranche 2 is expected later this year. It'll probably be about the same timeframe."", 'Julien Patrick Dumoulin-Smith', ""And maybe actually to put a finer point on that demand. I get that this is further but I mean, are you seeing -- I get that some of this load growth is sort of concentrated in specific corridors and specific interstates. But would you say that some of the dynamics that you're seeing elsewhere in the state could be mirrored in your geographies if you will? Are there any specific geography corridors that we should be watching here as we see, especially some of the more data centered load materializing here?"", 'Lisa M. Barton', 'So we are actively and aggressively marketing our mega sites that are located in both Iowa and Wisconsin, and that would really be the locations to be looking at?', 'Operator', 'The next question will be from Andrew Weisel at Scotiabank.', 'Andrew Marc Weisel', 'Just wanted to clarify a little bit of -- I think, Robert, you talked about this in the prepared remarks, but I want to ask about O&M and the weather impact. The $0.06 of negative weather, that is not included in the adjusted earnings, I think. So first question is, is that a change? Have you historically done that?', 'Robert J. Durian', ""No, Andrew. So we've consistently, probably for more than a decade now, removed the weather impacts from our adjusted earnings. Really, we think that's the appropriate way to manage the business. We've seen more efficiencies from an operational perspective to avoid ramping up and ramping down cost profiles of our operations group. And so that's something we've done, I think, for the entire 14 years that we've been able to achieve at least 5% growth."", 'Andrew Marc Weisel', ""Okay. I guess I don't mean to be critical, but you've got a great track record of meeting or exceeding the midpoint in, I think going back to 2015 or so. And obviously, this one was a little bit light. Anything to look into there? Obviously, it was a tough year with the interest rates and all that. But anything philosophically changing around either O&Ms or the midpoint as a target?"", 'Robert J. Durian', ""No, Andrew, I think we're managing the business as we've always managed the business. I think what you're seeing is the first time in the last 6 years where we've actually seen the temperature impacts come in with lower earnings and the previous 5 years, we let that additional earnings flow through to the bottom line and didn't offset that with additional spending. So we feel like we're being very consistent with the way we're operating the business."", 'Andrew Marc Weisel', ""And then lastly, apologies if I missed it, but what's your outlook for O&Ms in 2024?"", 'Robert J. Durian', ""Yes. Right now, we think it will be relatively flat. We are obviously facing inflationary pressures. We also have some additional O&M that we're expecting from the large amount of new generation that we're putting into service with solar projects and battery projects, but we have a lot of confidence in the team to be able to offset those impacts with our continued cost control measures."", 'Operator', 'Ms. Gille, at this time, there are no further questions.', 'Susan Trapp Gille', 'With no more questions, this concludes our call. A replay will be available on our investor website. Thank you for your continued support of Alliant Energy, and feel free to contact me with any follow-up questions.', 'Operator', 'Ladies and gentlemen, this does indeed conclude your conference call for today. Once again, thank you for attending. At this time, we ask that you please disconnect your lines. Have a good weekend.']"

Matt Higgins, RSE Ventures Co-Founder and CEO, joins Yahoo Finance for Good Buy or Goodbye, letting investors know which stocks to dig into and which to avoid when trying manage their portfolios.', 'Higgins chooses his Good Buy as Eli Lilly (LLY), citing the growth potential of GLP-1 drug market, the pipeline of obesity drugs for Eli Lilly as they continue to perfect weight-loss drugs, and the rate of obesity in America which makes for a large marketability.', 'Higgins picks his Goodbye as PepsiCo (PEP). Higgins argues GLP-1 users are less likely to snack, which would lead to a drop in snack food sales. Higgins also says that PepsiCo seems slow to pivot to healthier options and that PepsiCo has recently shown a decline in revenue.', 'For more expert insight and the latest market action, click here to watch this full episode of Yahoo Finance Live.', ""Editor's note: This article was written by Nicholas Jacobino"", 'JULIE HYMAN: It\'s a big, noisy universe of stocks out there. Welcome to ""Good Buy or Goodbye."" Our goal? To help cut through that noise to navigate the best moves for your portfolio.', ""Weight-loss drugs have taken Wall Street by storm. An insatiable demand for GLP-1s has fueled big profits for pharmaceutical giants and sparked concerns among food companies over changing consumer appetite. So what's the best way to play it now?"", ""I'm here with Matt Higgins, RSC Ventures cofounder and CEO. Thanks so much for being here."", 'MATT HIGGINS: Thanks for having me.', ""JULIE HYMAN: So let's get straight to your buy stock, and it's one that has already been a monster. We're talking about Eli Lilly here. Of course, we have seen it rocket over the last year. So let's get to your thesis as to why it's still a buy. First of all, you're looking at the continued growth potential for GLP-1s, in part based on some big estimates that we've been getting."", ""MATT HIGGINS: Yeah, look, for some people-- the reason I choose Lilly-- some people might think the train has left the station. I don't even think the train has begun to get underway. 40% of America laborers under obesity. It's a huge problem. This has the potential and will be the largest drug in the history of the United States-- of the world. $100 billion by 2030 is the estimate. I think it actually could be bigger because it's not factoring in what happens when insurance providers start to cover it."", ""I think it's going to become an issue of equity. You can't have obesity overindexed among a poorer population and then it's not covered. So I think this actually underestimates the power of Eli Lilly."", ""JULIE HYMAN: Interesting. Especially a good point on the coverage because I know that's been a concern for investors."", ""Second point here is what Eli Lilly specifically has to offer within this category because they're out with a couple of drugs but more to come."", 'MATT HIGGINS: Well, Eli Lilly is not resting on its laurels, right? So the Holy Grail now that everyone is chasing-- and some people just hate needles, and so can you do it in a pill form?', ""And here's a secondary problem. There's been some studies that show that there is a loss of muscle mass when you take GLP-1 drugs, and so it's an ongoing issue. So if you can combine a pill form with something that attacks muscle retention, that's going to open up a whole other market."", ""So Eli Lilly is kind of like an ETF because not only do you get the pipeline of obesity drugs they also have some exciting Alzheimer drugs on the horizon. So you don't need to win just in this category."", 'JULIE HYMAN: And then one more point in this category is the rate of obesity that we see in the US specifically.', ""MATT HIGGINS: Yeah, I mean, this drug is completely on trend. It's like the whole world has awoken to longevity. Aging is no longer seen as inevitable. If you look at the early data from Eli Lilly, not only is it addressing obesity, it's addressing comorbid conditions in ways they don't even completely understand, cardiovascular improvement in ways that aren't only attributed to weight loss. So in a lot of ways, it is a wonder drug."", ""So Americans are getting more and more focused on, How do we tackle obesity? Obesity is something that can be reversed, and that's not going to change."", 'JULIE HYMAN: At the same time, we always like to talk about risks that are associated with this. And I have to say, when you call it a wonder drug, sometimes if something sounds too good to be true, maybe it is. So you have to look at, What are the potential risks here with some of these drugs?', ""MATT HIGGINS: Of course, and I think that's why some people may have been slow to embrace it. One, they didn't take the drug, so they haven't seen the impact. Those who are evangelical about it, mostly."", ""Some of the risks are that we've seen it with fen-phen. There's been wonder drugs before, and it turned out to be unsafe. This has been studied vastly. There are some early reports, though, about issues with bowel blockage and some other, you know, secondary concerns. So, of course, you always wake up one day to an FDA alert and everything goes to hell, but, so far, it doesn't seem that way."", ""JULIE HYMAN: OK, so Eli Lilly, that's your goodbye. Let's talk about your good buy, the one you don't like related to this theme. And that is PepsiCo, and this is a very different stock chart over the past year. So let's get first here to what we've seen from GLP-1 users, which is sort of interesting here. Again, looking at some data from JPMorgan."", ""MATT HIGGINS: Yeah, so I do a lot in the consumer space. I have a lot of companies that focus on sweets, and I am seeing it everywhere. There has been a dramatic shift in behavior. If I was to go into ChatGPT and say, design me a holding company that is completely off trend, the answer would be Pepsi. Frito-Lay is about 50% of its revenue, you know, Cheetos and Doritos and all that. So the bottom line is there's a huge shift in consumer preferences that's not obvious. But as GLP-1 drugs spread throughout the population, this is going to become a significant impact on Pepsi's bottom line."", 'JULIE HYMAN: Yeah, I mean, this was an interesting survey in particular by people who were using the GLP-1s and just what, you know, the projections for what they were not going to be buying, yeah.', ""MATT HIGGINS: And look at these numbers. If you know anybody who's on a GLP-1 drug, they'll tell you the last thing they want is chips. They want protein."", 'JULIE HYMAN: Interesting.', 'MATT HIGGINS: They want-- yeah, they want health food.', ""JULIE HYMAN: It's just what they are craving to eat, which is interesting here."", ""In the case of Pepsi too, you know, they do have some-- they've made some changes in the portfolio, right-- smaller sizes, for example, of their packaging. But you say they've been slower to pivot to health."", ""MATT HIGGINS: Yeah, it's interesting. I teach at Harvard Business School direct to consumer, and this year we bought-- I brought in a beverage called Olipop, right? There's another one called Poppi, right? So they're all about probiotics and about, you know, gut health."", ""And what you can tell from looking around the classroom-- average age, probably 27. They're totally focused on drinking things that are good for them. Pepsi has tried, created their own. Has not worked. So they have been slow to pivot."", ""All you have to do is look at the tape. GLP-1-- Eli Lilly announced Mounjaro on May 22, 2022-- May 13, rather. The stock price has gone from $292 to $740. Pepsi that same day has gone from $620 to $617. It's flat."", ""JULIE HYMAN: Right. Yeah, so it's as you say. The tape tells the tale. And then, speaking of the tape telling the tale, Pepsi recently came out with its numbers, and the market was disappointed."", ""MATT HIGGINS: Yeah, I think it's not a coincidence that the same day that Mounjaro is launched with Eli Lilly, and then you look at Pepsi. That stock is entirely flat, which is hard to do. The S&P has gone up 26% in the same time. So I think the canary's in the coal mine with the fact that there's a revenue decline."", ""Wasn't entirely attributed to GLP drugs. I think it's the story below the story. But Pepsi is going to have to make a hard pivot or else, in my view, it's going to be in trouble."", 'JULIE HYMAN: All right, well, so that, I guess, is the upside risk to your bear case on Pepsi, that they make that pivot and start to build up their healthier brand portfolio.', ""MATT HIGGINS: So here's the upside case. I think, like a lot of big, massive brands like Pepsi, first they try to invent it in-house because everybody wants to be creative. And the reality? It's really hard to create the next TikTok brand when you're a stodgy corporation and don't want to take risks. And what do they do? They realize, we've got to go on a shopping spree."", 'So I would not be surprised to see Pepsi do a few things-- buy protein-based chips, start scooping those up; protein-based drinks; probiotic. They start rebranding themselves as a better-for-you holding company because they are just completely off trend, and the only thing they can do is shop their way out of it.', ""JULIE HYMAN: Interesting stuff. All right, and for disclosure for our viewers, you are long personally Eli Lilly, and you're short."", ""MATT HIGGINS: And I am very short. I'm very goodbye on Pepsi."", ""JULIE HYMAN: OK, so let's summarize then what you're telling people here. Basically you say buy Eli Lilly based on the growth potential of their GLP-1 franchise, including the pipeline of new medications and the state of obesity in America. On the other side, you say stay away from Pepsi for its reliance on income from snack foods, slow pivot to healthier options, and recent revenue declines."", 'MATT HIGGINS: There you have it.', 'JULIE HYMAN: Thanks so much. Really appreciate you appearing on ""Good Buy or Goodbye."" Thank you for watching, and we\'ll be bringing you new episodes three times a week at 3:30 PM Eastern.']"

And that's impacting some of Kraft Heinz's categories. As a result, we're seeing them continue to invest more as it pertains to research and development, so in terms of innovation, and that which aligns with consumer trends, as well as marketing, making sure that consumers are aware of the products that are out there, while also increasing their distribution in terms of the channels where consumers are shopping."", ""JED KELLY: From a free cash flow position, right, the business is really healthy and actually on a valuation-- on valuation perspective, or valuation basis, it trades at a favorable free cash flow yield relative to the EBITDA, because they have positive working capital dynamics. So this was a one time tax charge. Doesn't indicate the health of the business. The business is healthy. I think the question for investors right now is, we have decelerating room night, but a premium valuation. So you know, what's the right entry point to get in, get some of the top line KPIs?"", ""- Shares of Coca-Cola shares edging higher this morning.

They're getting that. And they expect to continue to get it."", ""And so we had thought that they were best positioned going in just given the balance of their revenue to be balanced between volumes and pricing, which they likely get in 2024. And they're always able to generate productivity and operating efficiencies to drive some leverage. So it was a really good guide coming in above the high end of their long-term-- coming in above their long-term algorithm on both the top and bottom line, I think the shares are being rewarded as a result."", ""MICHAEL BELLISARIO: If you think about the market being down a percent, and Marriott's 2024 EPS guidance being about 3% below street expectations, you add that together, that's 4%. That's kind of roughly what the stock is down. So not totally surprised to see the stock weaker.
